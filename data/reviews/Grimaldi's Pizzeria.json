{"text":"I expressed to an employee of a pizza place at NyNy casino that I wanted authentic pizza. The employee hesitated but recommend Grimaldi's, and another employee muffled not to buy their pizza.. Without hesitation, I navigated the pizza place and went... We ordered pesto with meatball n ricotta cheese pizza and pepperoni w sausage pizza. The ingredients are fresh!! Totally worth the $. Dessert was fresh as well! We had tiramisu and Ny cheese cake (not too sweet and creamy and cheese cake fluffy) defiantly not frozen or old."}
{"text":"I'd been wondering about these guys for years, and finally we got a $4 off coupon to tempt us in.  Ordered a Caesar salad, and also a plain personal pan pizza. Salad was great, and even the spines of the greens were sweet. Pizza was very nice, if different from what I'm used to. Its crust was a nice thin and crisp situation that did not get soggy at any time, thus making it better than what I got from nearby Novecento. And I'm going to say that the cheese and sauce were good but not as good as the also-nearby Montesano's Eateria - but Montesano's had a thicker, breadier crust that interfered too much with the other ingredients in my opinion.  Staff were friendly, water tasted clean, and ambiance was nice. We came in during a slow time, so it wasn't busy or loud, but I can see how it would get very busy and very loud during dinner."}
{"text":"Remember when it is near coal re-stoke time make sure the server does not fail to get your pizza order despite ordering on time.   This just happened yesterday.  No pizza but had a nice salad."}
{"text":"It really isnt as good as locals will tell you before you go. I think its the kinda place were you really gotta get lucky with the person working the oven that day. It also seems like if you dont order any of the ingredients that they offer \"extra\" for, it isnt as good, making a simple pie get a little pricey."}
{"text":"Love this kind of pizza I forget how good it is until I remember when I have that first slice again. The crust is very NYC and adding the special touch of baking it in a coal burning oven really adds to the flavor.  I like my pizza topping simple pepperoni and sausage and they use very special pepperoni not the cheap kind and the mozzarella they use is very creamy not stringy.   If you like a lot of stuff on your pie this may not be your kind of pizza but if you like great NYC style pizza without the grease then give this place a try"}
{"text":"I have serious pie cred- I grew up in NJ-NY metro and lived on the border of Italy (Alps) for the last five years. Grimaldi's must be the best Pizza in the Southwestern US. Stopped in here on holiday and had one of the best pizzas of my life. Perfect (not-too) thin crust, fresh home made mozzarella, flavorful tomato sauce topped with top notch pepperoni and jalapenos. Wash that down with Peroni on tap and you have perfection."}
{"text":"It was a very nice looking place , the staff were fantastic , the food was good , however I did think for the price the food was not great. We had jalapeños on our pizza and they were pickled and the vinegar was over powering the rest of the pizza flavours. I wouldn't recommend there is better pizza cheaper."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this place for the first time and we where pleasantly surprised about how delicious the pizza was. It was not greasy but just right. Every one was super friendly and the place was very clean. It was the best pizza in Las Vegas. When we want pizza we are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's for me is the best place in Las Vegas for traditional coal oven pizza. It's not 100% Neapolitan, it is more like coal oven NY style.  The crust is crispy on the outside, soft, moist and chewy in the middle (foldable) and has a nice aroma from the coal oven. The sauce tastes fresh and balanced (bordering slightly on sweet).  If you expect to find the gobs of generic \"cheese\" found in most pizza places you won't find it at Grimaldi's. They use fresh mozzarella and it barely covers the pizza crust but it is fresh and delicious and you can taste it in every bite. And if that's not enough, the pizza is not greasy at all!  It is satiating without bloating you up and making you feel like you ate an anvil.  As for toppings I usually order their red peppers and maybe some extra cheese or sauce. I have tried adding chicken but the pizza ended up very moist.   Their Mediterranean salad is fresh and a decent serving.  The cheesecake is pretty good, not artificially and overly sweet like some others, sweet enough to taste like dessert while also tasting fresh.  Service has been very good and the staff has been very attentive. There is some outdoor seating which is great, especially when it's windy. Inside the decor makes you feel like you're in NY with pictures, street signs, rail signs etc.  Overall one of the best pizza places in the valley and the best for oven baked pizza. I prefer Grimaldi's over Settebello for thin oven baked pizza; though quite similar in many respects, Grimaldi's gets my vote."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Vegas. I always order the Mediterranean Salad add salami. Its always crisp, fresh ingredients & delicious vinaigrette dressing. A glass of Napa Cellars Chardonnay perfectly chilled. And a large meatball, ricotta, sundried tomato topped with fresh basil pizza so I always have leftovers to go. Absolutely, devine."}
{"text":"I have to be honest. \" Best Pizza Ever\" . The coal fired pizza crust is amazing..the crunch at the bottom of every bite....mmm, makes you want more. The selection of toppings are high quality & always fresh. I am addicted to this place. Service is always welcoming & friendly."}
{"text":"Great pizza in Las Vegas, one of my favorites. A thin crust that taste great!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza just the right flavor from the coal bit mild compared to the place in Jacksonville I went to but very good along fresh ingredients. Had a good view of the pizza makers as well.  Line was out the door but not a really long wait real quick pizza makers.  They have opened a store in California and will have to look to go there.  Worth the trip out here along with a trip to Boyce Thompson."}
{"text":"Another great experience!! We have one day left in Vegas and we might have to have another pizza from Grimaldi's!!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Grimaldi's. A lot of good things. Many tell me it's the best pizza in Vegas.  I went there with my family a couple weeks ago, and yeah it's pretty good. I really don't see what all the hype is about though. It's a good pizza, but far from the best in Vegas. The sauce was a bit too sweet, but the pie was solid otherwise.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice. I especially like the black and white photos of New York on the walls, which match the décor perfectly and really add to the authenticity of the place.  Like I said, it's a good pizza. I'll come back to Grimaldi's, I'm sure, but I won't hype it up to my friends for fear of them leaving disappointed."}
{"text":"The plan for the day was to sashay the Strip. So all of my friends that hadn't been here before suggested to walk from one end to the other. Thank goodness we did because we decided to eat at this pizza spot first.  We arrived around 11 am and a line had already formed to eat this famous pizza, but the line moved pretty quickly and our party of nine didn't have to wait longer than 20 minutes. The cool thing is that this restaurant is located in the Fashion Show Mall, so I can window shop.  The pizzas were a good size, we ordered three large pies. 1) The classic Margherita 2) White pizza (no tomato sauce) with garlic and mushrooms 3) Tomato sauce based pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and olives  All pizzas were good, with a thin crust and not too soggy. My personal favorite was the white pizza. So simple yet very flavorful! I wouldn't say this is the best pizza I have ever had but it's definitely something you should try.  Expect your experience to be quick, we ordered the pizzas and were in and out in less than an hour. You'd have to expect a quick dining experience especially if a line is waiting outside."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and it was pretty good. The food was still good this time but the service was very disappointing. When we came in they told us we can't get pizza for 30 min because they're replacing the bricks. Understandable. But I feel like they shouldn't do this during peak. We ended up waiting over an hour and we didn't get any apology about the long wait which wouldve been appreciative. Clearly it's not the waitresses fault, but having us just sit here waiting was disappointing. It took me another 10 minutes just to get a side of pizza sauce. Which by the way is very bland, I get the white pizza though so the pizza was decent. I won't be coming back. I like the pizza but I know better pizza places that actually are kind and courteous, and worth the cost. I would recommend Zella's instead. If you still decide to come here just make sure you call ahead as I wish I did. And hopefully they won't tell you 30 minutes when it is at least an hour wait. ):"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good.  A mystery is they do not serve ranch dressing, which is weird because they serve salad.  This actually was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"We had a beer at the bar and ordered a pizza to go. It was a very pleasant dining experience, with the hard-working bartender being very attentive but not obnoxious.  The pizza is something special with extraordinarily fresh mozzarella and a tasty sauce that had some texture, but not too much ... for a person like me that won't eat chunks of tomatoes.  They kept the pizza in the \"crisper\" for a good 25 minutes while we finished our beer and by the time we got back to the hotel it was pretty soggy. Sticking it in the oven mostly brought the crisp back.  From the look of the salads around us, they were generous  I really like this place and would definitely go back.  (Beer and wine only, with a very limited liquor selection)"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in Arizona.  If you don't like it and rate it 2 stars or something, that's fine by me.  Have a nice night at Pizza Hut, I am headed to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Great food!  Fresh ingredients.   Good portions. Felt full and happy when I left. Good service too."}
{"text":"WOW, what happened to one of my favorite pizzas???  We have loved the pizza here for a few years but our experience last week was bad.  It was Saturday evening and we were told there was a 30-40 minute wait for a table and they would text when our table was ready. No Problem, we walked around the Quarter.  50 minutes later (and no text) we came back to the front door and waited outside.  Looking inside, many tables were empty but full of dirty dishes.  After 1 hour and 10 minutes, I asked how the hostess about the approximate wait, she looked at the list and said \"I can seat you now\"  When were they going to tell us???  She took us to a table that had a filthy tablecloth.  We asked for a clean table.  The waiter was nice and friendly.  Placed our order for a salad and a pizza.  After about 15 minutes, we asked if we could get the salad before the hot pizza and he said he would check on it.  5 minutes later he brought the salad and as soon as we started serving it, the pizza arrived.  He was nice enough to ask if we wanted a fresh pizza when we were finished with the salads.  When the pizza came out, it was drenched in tomato sauce and barely had any cheese. The other toppings were fine. BUT, Not what we have had in the past.  It was BAD!!!  Interestingly, we mentioned this experience to some friends that also frequent this Grimaldi's and they said when they were there about a week ago, they were very disappointed too."}
{"text":"Great staff, very friendly! I had the salad and pepperoni pizza, both delicious. It was well worth the money, I will definetely go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great food! Ask for extra cheese. The staff is friendly and takes care of their customers. Best cal zone I've ever had."}
{"text":"Not a traditional New York slice but the original New York slice nonetheless.  Either way..it's fantastic.  The pizza bursts with flavor.  I usually ask for a little extra sauce and cheese though because they're getting a little weak when you order just a plain cheese pizza, which is 9 out of 10 times my go to.  A must try pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty good food but need to add some ranch dressing to their menu not everyone likes Italian dressing. Ordered a house salad with add on Genoa Salami, they forgot the salami, asked for Chicago cut (squares) I received pie slices. We ordered 2 cocktails - it took over 15 minutes for each drink. And there was hardly any cheese on the pizza - I guess I was expecting to much, cheese on pizza who would have thought!!! That was my third time there I was hoping each time would have been better but three strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"Amazingly good pizza ... just wished their salads were as good. Pizza crust, sauce and ingredients are all wonderful. Their salads however are very unexciting."}
{"text":"Always great food, and atmosphere! On a Saturday for dinner, only had to wait about 15 minutes!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here almost once a week for pizza. We love the white pizza and add mushrooms and the Brooklyn (substitute pepperoni for sausage). Tuesdays are half off wine. I love the outdoor seating. Nicely run, the manager seems pretty involved with the goings ons."}
{"text":"Wood fire pizza is the way to go.  I got there at 4pm and was told I would have to wait while the \"re-stoke\" the fire.  It was not a big deal.  They do this each day.  The pizza came out amazing.  It's a thin crust and the pizza is crispy on the bottom.  No part of the dough was under-cooked as so often happens with thicker crusts.  There was a good balance of sauce versus bread too.  I ate the whole pizza and it was worth the carbs.  I plan to go back if I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! One of the best pizzas I've ever tasted. Service was fast and the staff very friendly. You pick the toppings that you want so you really can't go wrong. I usually don't eat the crust, but I'd eat the Grimaldi's thin crust. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The pizza is phenomenal. All fresh ingredients, thin NY style crust, fresh mozzeralla, nice sauce. What more can anyone want? Born and raised in Queens and I will tell you no doubt the best pizza in Phoenix and top 3 or 4 including New York pizzerias."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is amazing.  Wonderful service and atmosphere.  Great place to dine with children too."}
{"text":"Friggin' sweet pies here! Customa souvice like you wouldn't believe, forget abatt it!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I went last night to get the whole fine dining experience and taste, what we thought would be good NY pizza...oh how wrong we were!!! My friend is pretty much a vegetarian and does eat chicken so we ordered a veggie/chicken pizza...omg! God awful. There was barely any cheese on there and had no real flavor, the crust was horrible. We asked the server if we could add some cheese to the pizza we had in front of us and she said that for \"health reasons\" they could not put the pizza back in the oven...stupid!! She urged us to order another pizza with extra cheese and the same toppings...who does that??? So, thinking that it would be better, we did so, (they did comp the first one we ordered) and still a horrible mistake. It was soggy and still had no taste but with more cheese. My friend and I have literally had better pizza in a hole in a wall place by the night clubs in Old Town Scottsdale. The only thing that made this place bearable was the wine...we will never again try this place...I mean they didn't even have any music playing...no real ambiance, food was awful and service was terrible. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe some of the rave reviews I read here. Pizza's OK, but really nothing extraordinary. Fairly standard, typical thin-crust pizza I've had better at my local bars.   Our pizza arrived less than really HOT the way I want it to arrive since pizza cools quickly. At $2 per topping I would expect them to be more generous with their toppings than Pizza Hut.   The House Salad is plain and boring. For $5 for the small salad you'd think they'd try to differentiate it from every other house salad out there... but no.  Lastly, the beer is overpriced also. At $5 for a Sam Adams Lager I'd expect a tall glass or large mug. I was disappointed to see it arrive in a small, what I'm guessing to be, 12oz. glass.  There is better value (better pizza and beer) for the money elsewhere. Change that... There is better pizza and beer for the money just about ANYWHERE."}
{"text":"Best service we've ever received at any restaurant! We came here at 5pm on a Friday evening and didn't have to wait, we were seated immediately! Jaime, (our server) was outstanding! The food was amazing as well, and got a great deal on our beers since we were there during happy hour! Will be back and will definitely be requesting Jaime! Highly recommend her"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, loved the thin crispy crust. Next time I would split a personal size pizza, it is plenty big for 2 people and I'd order a large salad and split that as well. We also had the sampler desert and that was fantastic as well. Perfect meal, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and we ALWAYS get the ceasar salad with anchovies. Great wine selection. Service is consistent and friendly every time."}
{"text":"I LOVE the pizza at Grimaldi's.   I would recommend giving this place a shot if you are a pizza fan. It's quite different from your usual pizza. The pizza has thin crust with light sauce and cheese. So far I've had pepperoni and sausage pizza as well as chicken and artichoke. They were both wonderful.   The service isn't spectacular. It isn't bad in the slightest but the servers aren't as friendly and open as I like.   Definitely give this place a try. I've heard both raving reviews and just OK reviews but I've never heard anyone regret going to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Gramaldis pizza is fantastic and well worth the wait. It's made to order. Watch the guy toss it and then the bake in a pizza oven. The salads they offer taste fresh. I've tried their calzones but I must say those are just not as good as the pizzas.  It's expensive especially when you start adding the toppings on, but fresh ingredients are worth the extra cost. Very nice atmosphere but could use a couple more TVs."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of thin-as-paper style pizza, but this place's is pretty fantastic. Kind of a \"work of art\" like they try to push with Neapolitan pizza at ritzier places, but not quite at those places' price point. In fact, my pizza was free with the b-day coupon they gave me just for signing up for their e-mail fan club!  The atmosphere here is nice, too. Dimly lit like an Italian place should be, and replete with the whole red and white checkered table cloths that say \"pizza place,\" but they're cloth (not plastic or whatever) and nice.  All-in-all, pleasantly surprised for a free large pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's probably the pizza ever. We ate at the one in Scottsdale AZ, Dallas Tx, and Gilbert AZ. They were all so very good all taste the same, and had a wonderful staff. We highly recommend the pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Las Vegas last week. On Monday 22 July 2013, we found Grimaldi's using the Yelp app on my phone. Because of the reviews, we decided to try it.   We were very satisfied with our experience. It was later at night (around 9 pm) and the place was still busy but we did not have to wait. The restaurant was very clean and well decorated. The salad and pizza were fantastic and the service was also great. We truly enjoyed our experience and were glad we found the place using Yelp. Prices were very reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Graimaldi's. Used to live in Vegas and would visit the Eastern location at least twice a month, a trek from the west side. Now that I live in CA my first and last stop is always Grimaldi's. Checked out their two new locations while I was there, Boca park is much bigger. The waitress told us they are also opening 2 locations on the strip, 1 in the Palazzo and 1 at the Rio with hopefuly a CA location soon. My favorite is the Pepperoni with extra basil and the half price wine night every Tuesday."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Las Vegas! The ingredients are always so fresh and the pepperoni and sausage looks and tastes \"REAL\". Not like processed meats that other pizza joints use. The crust is always cooked to perfection, nice and crunchy. I usually order just the pepperoni and cheese pizza and a salad. Their salads are pretty good too. The Mediterranean salad is delicious. If you want good pizza, make sure you check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizzas you will eat anywhere in the states even in Italy! I'm a Brooklyn girl and this tastes like the original I've been going to as a kid! Well done Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am usually not a huge pizza fan. By that I mean I'm not the kind of person that will just settle for pizza on a night where I can't decide what to make for dinner. But if I am craving pizza, then when I get it I want it to be great. Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to be a little unhealthy and eat at Grimaldis for the first time. He's usually not a fan of thin crust pizza (I love it, though) and we were both really impressed! Our waiter was good as well, Alex I believe. I usually can't eat more than a slice and I had 3... It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for definitely."}
{"text":"I am a Pizza snob.  I am qualified to judge pizza as I am a Philadelphian who grew up enjoying great thin crust pizza.  I also lived in Italy when I was in the Navy and was blessed to enjoy the heavenly wood fired stone oven pies that was as good as it gets.  Throughout my travels, Grimaldi's is the closest thing to the great pizzas of Italy.  Cooked over charcoal briquets, the pizzas come out perfectly -- thin crusts that are tender and soft yet rigid enough where it won't collapse.  The crust is bursting with flavor.  Cheese and toppings were equal to the outstanding crust.   I had my Grimaldi's plain and I had it once with anchovies.  I loved both. But as I learned in Italy: The best pizzas, the ones the old \"paisons\" liked were the simple cheese pizzas with no toppings [The old men of Italy would probably laugh at some American dude eating a sloppy 12-topping \"Supreme Pizza.\" That's not pizza, that's garbage on dough!!!]. I'd say the plain cheese pizza is the best pizza to get at Grimaldi's.  Salads, beverages and service are all top notch.  Servers are friendly and attractive.  You can't go wrong with the many great restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale.  But Grimaldi's is probably my favorite."}
{"text":"I can only speak about their gluten free pizza. Believe the crust was made in house. Was better than some I've had, but nothing special. The pizza overall lacked flavor."}
{"text":"First time diner and was pleasantly greeted at the door. Our waiter,Alex, was also pleasant and welcomed us. We requested Gorgonzola cheese on our Magarit pizza to mellow out the anchovies topped with fresh basil. It was super and will definitely return. Joe the manager also gave us a history of Grimaldi's as well as the hours the oven is cleaned. The interior decor was inviting and the outside patio/bar would be alternate seating choice. The people, the food and the ambiance is top shelf!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing! My favorite is the pepperoni and jalapeño pizza. They have great service."}
{"text":"We showed up an hour before close which I feel a little bad about, but even then, everyone there was polite and more than accommodating!  Being our first time there, the waiter (Anthony I think was his name) took the time to explain how everything works there. How the pizza is made, the drinks, the specials, just really really courteous and professional. He recommended we try the BBQ chicken pizza and boy we were thoroughly impressed. It was a short visit but the food was so delicious, and the staff was welcoming and friendly. Definitely plan on returning soon!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was awesome, and bar was rally cool. I loved the pizza and people and the atmosphere and would recommend any pizza lover to go there for a great dinner. Everything was perfect!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and I have lived in NY so I think I am a fair judge! I just wish they would expand or open another location. They are always busy. Worth the wait if you have the time!!!"}
{"text":"Omg! The pizza was simply delicious. The strawberry spinach salad is a MUST try. Couldn't have been happier with this place!"}
{"text":"The kindest way that I can describe my experience this evening is to say that Grimaldi's is underwhelming. Our waitress was very nice, but on the whole, the waiters/waitresses and managers seem to congregate around the stone ovens, largely neglecting the customers. A woman sitting near us accidentally knocked over her water glass, and it spilled over the table and onto her. We offered her our napkins, but it took at minimum 10 minutes for her waiter to notice the spill or even check on them to see if they needed a refill.  My mom's Sierra Mist was flat and tasteless, and even our waitress confused it with the water on the table. When we told her how tasteless it was, she brought us lemonade instead (at our request) which was watered down and flavorless.   The small, thin-crust pizza we ordered took 30 minutes to get to us, and when it did, it was not worth the wait. Parts of the crust were burnt and other parts were undercooked. The cheese was stringy and flavorless; the cheese on Costco pizza literally tastes and looks fresher and has more flavor. The sauce did not taste fresh--more like it had been resurrected from a can. Some of the pepperonis on the pizza were cooked; most were wholly uncooked. We ate the pizza because we were starving and tired, and now my stomach feels off. If I could turn back time, we would have gone to pretty much any other restaurant.   Spend your money elsewhere.  UPDATE: This place definitely got me sick--had a stomachache when I went back home."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's serves up some of the best pizza I've ever had, however, it is a bit on the pricey end, but it's worth it.  The toppings are all top quality and very fresh and the crust is perfect.  I love that they have fresh basil.  They also have a very impressive wine list.  The night I was there, they were about to change their wine list, so they had several half price bottles.  We had an incredible white that would have been worth the full price.  Overall, the experience was great.  The pizza, service and wine list are all worth the trip."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had so fresh.. the service was explicit we never had to ask for drink refills. There was a little bit of a wait because it was a busy night with a spring training game nearby but it was worth it."}
{"text":"If you like brick oven style pizza then Grimaldi's is the place. I never thought I would like brick oven pizza are usually like the softer type of pizza crust. however after trying Grimaldi's one time after a friend recommended it I actually loved it it wasn't too soft but it wasn't too hard either and the flavor was amazing. The prices average not little like a Domino's or Pizza Hut would be but also not as expensive as the higher-end pizza restaurants. I had the meat pizza with sausage pepperoni ground beef. it was delicious but not healthy. LOL!!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has long been my favourite pizza in Las Vegas, but in my latest order, and in a rare event, they made a mistake. However, the manager personally attended to me and my order, and made it right promptly and courteously! The pizza and the sangria are the best in town!!!"}
{"text":"Invariably the conversation of \"good pizza\" comes up when you are speaking to new friends in this wonderful city.  I can say without hesitation that I have yet to have anybody not agree with me that Grimaldi's is fantastic.  I have been to three of them and the atmosphere is good at all of them but the pizza is great.  The only reason that I can truly give as to why their pizza tastes so darned good is the ingredients.   It seems like everything is not only fresh as can be, but also the best possible quality.  From the cheese to the vegetables to the meats that they use...they all seem to be the best of the best.  If you have one choice for pizza, try this coal fired creation.  It is truly worth the trip.  As good as a New York styled gets unless you need the grease, and lets face it....that can be good too but this one lets you walk out feeling good about yourself."}
{"text":"This is what a pizza should be!  Mmmm. Coal flash baked with real sliced mozzarella. If you like Neapolitan/New York style thin pizzas, must try!"}
{"text":"Pizza and salad were excellent!  This is the 4th Grimaldi's location we have visited, and might be my favorite.  The ambience was lovely and the service was superb.  We started with the house salad and antipasto platter.  Both were fresh and delicious.  We ordered two \"small\" pizzas, which was more than enough for 5 people.   As expected, the pizza arrived piping hot.  I love the fesh mozzarella on the pizza and believe there is nothing better than this.  If I had room, I could have eaten it all!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I order chicken and mushroom pizza to pick up the crust is soggy and wet! The pepperoni, however is crisp throughout the entire bottom of the pizza. Very disappointing to get home with soggy, inedible high priced pizza. FAIL"}
{"text":"The food was great, but the terrible waitress really brought down the night for us. I ate there last Tuesday evening with my husband and mother-in-law. The waitress Bryna (dark hair in ponytail, olive complexion, average build) came to take our drink order. We had drinks at home so we declined and asked for waters. That were things started to go downhill.  -She cleared away the wine glasses in a abrupt manner, banging them into the pizza rack on our table and walked away without saying a word. -After a long wait, she finally came to take our order. We declined to order salads and that made her walk away huffing and puffing. -The food came, and the one time she did come to check on us she did not look at us when speaking and whatever she was saying was inaudible. -We paid with a giftcard and she came back after awhile acting annoyed and saying she has to wait for the manager to apply the giftcard. -As she was explaining this, our credit card fell from her hand onto the table and she picked it up and walked away without saying anything.   She made us feel like she was mad because we didn't order a lot of food because she sure was chatting it up with the party at the table next to us. I filled out a comment card but don't know if it ever made it to management.  I plan on coming back but I just hope she never waits on us again."}
{"text":"Nice place but for 1 Pizza, two kid drinks, 2 beers and a small Salad it was about $67 w tip. I guess the rent is high in the Quarter. Just not worth it for pizza n beer.  I think it's more of a place to be seen than really a basic pizza joint. I guess there is a market for it though as the wait was 25 min."}
{"text":"First off, the service was top notch.  My wife and I never had to wait for anything because our waiter was always checking up on us and bringing drinks when he noticed that we were getting low.  He was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  The prices were reasonable, especially being in the Palazzo hotel.  The food was very good.  The toppings were fresh and quality ingredients. I've only had New York style pizza a few times.  It was in New York, but many years ago.  So I can't tell you how authentic it is.  The only reason it was not given 5 stars was because some of the dough was a touch overcooked.  It was still good and a non issue for us.  If you are looking for good pizza and a casual atmosphere, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We've going to Grimaldi's for the past 2 years or more. I can't say enough about Audrey. She anticipates our needs and always have a smile and of course, our drinks ready. If it wasn't for her I don't know if we would continue to be patrons there. The pizza's good but the bartender's even better. Thanks Audrey for all the service you've put in customer service."}
{"text":"Like most of you, I love some pizza.  In my opinion, Grimaldi's is hands down the best in town.  I don't mind paying a bit more for this type of quality. Great Pizza, friendly atmosphere, and good service is what you can expect. We will definitely come back, every time we want pizza!! Thanks Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"The food is great.  Try the antipasto salad.  The pizza is one of the best oven-fired pies in town (Pizzeria Bianco is the gold standard).  Only knock is the service.  It is hit and miss.  Recently had the pizza come out before the salad- they forgot about it.  We sent it back and they removed it from the bill.  Not a biggie- we still make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"Such great pizza and at an affordable price! Ask for Christy Martin as your server, she's very attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a popular pizza place in NY and I like how they've carried the NY theme throughout the restaurant, even with subway signs in the bathroom.  I've been here bunches of times but apparently never during a rush because I've never had to wait for a table.  Pizza, salad, dessert - that's it.  I've never had enough room for dessert, even though I go in there with every intention of trying the cheesecake.  I just get too full on the salad and pizza.  A \"small\" salad is big enough for at least 2 people.  You could probably stretch it to 4 people if you all want just a taste of salad before your pizza.  The dressing is a little heavy, and while I don't eat salad that way at home, I do enjoy it as a bit of a treat when I go out.  The pizza is wood fired, thin-crust New York style.  It comes out looking more like a piece of modern art than pizza.  There's a bit of sauce here, some cheese there, other toppings over there.  The mozzarella is fresh and I've enjoyed each of the meat toppings at one point or another.  The crust is thin and crispy, but definitely not thick enough to pick up and eat, so I eat this pizza with a fork and knife.  Good food, good atmosphere, and late hours - this location is open until 11 p.m. every night."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I decided it was a pizza night so we shuffled up to Grimaldi's in DC Ranch. Even though the location in the Quarter is much closer to home, we like the atmosphere at this North Scottsdale location much better. Alex took good care of us as we ordered our appetizer of Caprese and a large white pie with a side of anchovies (for me) as our main course. Unfortunately, our pizza arrived prior to the appetizer. Also, my anchovies did not arrive with the pizza. We told the server to cancel the appetizer which we were looking forward to as we arrived pretty hungry. So, at this point, Chris the manager arrived at the table with the Caprese. He was very apologetic and unhappy at how our order was mishandled. He explained there was a problem in the kitchen during a rush with one pizza maker down for a Saturday night. He said the appetizer will be on the house along with the anchovies and our choice of dessert. He came back a few minutes later to check on us and again apologized and articulated how important it is to him to keep his customers happy. This visit received our highest rating for the quality of the food and for the way they responded to the order being mishandled. There's a reason why some restaurants succeed and some fail. Treating the customers the right way when there is a breakdown in an order is a recipe for success. Also, a big shout out to Alex our server and Ashley the bartender on duty."}
{"text":"We love Grimaldis and have been going to their various locations for years!  However, this location in particular is possibly having issues with their water.  We ordered waters to drink, they tasted like metal, then the sauce on the pizza was very bitter.  We just dined at downtown Scottsdale Grimaldis last week and everything tasted so much better there!  So could be possible issues with their water and you can taste it in the  pizza..."}
{"text":"I walked in around 9:25 lastnight, which was a Thursday night and the first thing the hostess said to me was \"you do realize we close in 30 minutes right?\" \"We have a takeout option, I would suggest that\" so I immediatly walked out and went to stingray sushi and was done before 10. I've never met a more inconserate hostess and I've never felt so unwelcome in my entire life. Im a hostess myself and if I ever spoke to a customer like that I would be fired, you are never to deny service while you are open especially 30 minutes before you close when the place is still packed.  I will never go back because of that girl."}
{"text":"The best Caesar salad ever, and their pizza's are very good too.  Service is amazing!"}
{"text":"I heard about grimaldis from my cousin. So I though to try it out. Went there today with my wife and my son. We got there around 4:45pm. Host at the front got us our table quick. The server came rite after. There were only a couple of table and I think a big party on the patio. We were so hungry so ordered the food rite away and had to wait almost about 45 minutes to get the food. Had I know earlier I would have never gone there for the food.  Also ordered tiramisu to go and ask for the fork so my wife can eat in the car. They didn't even have the forks.  By the time we left the restaurant it was packed. Food was good but there were lots of other area they need to work on. Will think about it 10 times before I decide to go there again."}
{"text":"If you love simple, thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients, this pizza will make your knees weak.  The tomato sauce was stellar - it had a wonderful balance of savory, sweetness and acidity.  The crust has both bite and chew, a hint of natural sweetness and serious flavor.  Outstanding food and unusually good service.  To end the meal, you have to get the cheescake. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Grimaldi's in quiet a while, but returned to cash in on my free one topping birthday pizza.  I have to say I don't know what happened since our last visit months ago when we loved going to Grimaldi's.   Our previous experience was that the service was excellent and so was the food.  Things are definitely not the same.  We walked in and sat down at an empty bar.  The bartender was standing right in front of us wiping glasses.  She didn't greet us or look up.  When she did great us it was hardly a warm welcome.  The hostesses also seemed disorganized and confused.  When we arrived at our table our server was welcoming but also disorganized and confused.  Finally, the food was not as I remembered.  Let's say it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and I'm a fan.  I am impressed with the amount of money they spend filtering their water to be chemically similar to New York City water. If you know some of the science of baking, the minerals present in the water will affect the gluten development (among other things) and this can have a noticeable effect on the resulting pizza crust.  Any place that is fanatic about their pizza as Grimaldi's clearly cares about the product they produce, and Grimaldi's has a great product.  The service is so-so. One time I went the guy kept trying to be funny as he tried to up-sell us on apps and desserts. But he did it in such a way that it was more irritating than funny, and you could tell he was just going through the motions. I thought it was sad to see an employee working who was clearly not enthusiastic about his job. (We all have off days, so I'm not going to slam them on that one interaction.)  I went on Monday and I told my waitress I wanted a white pizza with ricotta cheese and sun dried tomatoes. When the pizza arrives: ricotta and red bell peppers... at least she got the right color! ;)  I've also been when the waitstaff was just inattentive and didn't fill my drink when it needed to be filled. (If you've read my other reviews, you know that's a big deal for me when it comes to sit-down restaurants... if you aren't going to have a dispenser out for your customers to fill themselves, then your waitstaff needs to be attentive.)  Overall, it's great. I keep going back. The service is not what I'd consider deserving of a 5-star rating, but it is arguably better than most. I just don't want to be frivolous with my 5-star ratings."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting at the bar at this Grimaldi's location waiting for my takeout pizza to be remade.  Crust was burnt and overcooked. I routinely order take out here but about 1/3 of the time I end up having to send a pizza back because of the extreme burnt edges on the crust.  I figured it was about time to give my review.  The other 2/3 of the time I eat here the pizzas as great.  But I have to knock them down a couple stars due to lack of consistency.  C'mon guys. The other Grimaldi's in town don't suffer from this same up and down inconsistency."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at this location recently per several recommendations from friends.  We had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, house salad, and cannoli.    To be truthful, I was expecting greatness.  All the reviews I read and all of the feedback from friends built this place up and I was hoping for an awesome pizza place that would be nearby.  End result, I simply can not understand the cult-like following of this restaurant.   I mean, it is hard to mess up pizza.  You have to seriously be a pretty bad if you can't turn out a decent pie.    Grimaldi's pizza was simply average.  Our pizza came out and looked great, but as soon as you picked up a piece, dark grease poured (quite literally) off.  As a result, flavor and texture wise the pizza was a near equivalent of the \"pizza\" from Sbarro's or any other mall pizza.  I have been to Cibo, Bianco, and the like.  Overall the best pizza I have found is from Picazzo's."}
{"text":"Great pizza?and we also enjoyed the Caprese salad.  We ordered the small pizza... Mozzarella, Kalamata olives and pepperoni and it was sooo good?nice ambience in the Palazzo hotel.  The reason a three star is because they did not have much beers on tap, the beers were offered in menu, just weren't available when asked for them.  But the food was great."}
{"text":"On Friday evening at about 7 pm we had to wait 30 min for a table (for four) and than another 25 min for pizza. The thin crust pizza was delicious but no reservations accepted (need to wait to be seated)."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Excellent Pizza really really good. And the waiters are  all of them so so nice.  The owner is frequently there asking if everything is allright . We have gone different days, different seasons, , always really great."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time this week. We enjoyed the food, especially the Oreo Cheesecake dessert, and we enjoyed the staff! Right when we walked in, the door was opened for us by the hostess (Already loved the place at that point). The staff was very friendly and helpful!   Our waiter Anthony was awesome. We will go there again and request his table. He was nice, knowledgeable, and was not pushy or rushing us like other restaurants do. Also the bussers were very helpful as well!  Glad we ate there!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice and both times I waited over 15 minutes before I was even offered a drink. Both times the staff pointed fingers when I asked for a waiter. Both times the place wasn't busy. No excuse for the bad service. I won't go back."}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA IN ARIZONA. Now Ive never had any East coast pizza (yet) but this is what we have in the West and it is the best. They have a small menu and they do each and every item to perfection!"}
{"text":"If NY style pizza is your favorite kind of pizza and you haven't tried Grimaldis, go tonight! If NY style pizza isn't your favorite, go to Grimaldis tonight and make it your favorite."}
{"text":"I had the personal size pizza with meatball, it was tasty. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really really good.  The best part is you can walk right in and don't have to wait outside in Brooklyn for over an hour until you get seated (which I have done before). The location in the Palazzo is spacious, clean, and friendly. Although there was only two of us, we opted for the large pizza since it was only $2 more and we figured we could eat the leftovers (if any) later on in the evening. I would highly recommend this as a great dining option while in Vegas, especially if you are around this area of the strip.  Also I highly recommend getting the fresh tomatoes on your pizza...they were amazing (maybe early girls?). Yum."}
{"text":"A really nice place to go to for a \"different\" pizza experience. It has a nice ambience, friendly staff and relatively reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza!  They claim it is NY style, but The crust they use is a little thinner then what you find in New York.  You see the key to good pizza is a perfectly foldable crust.  You cant fold a slice of Grimaldis.  Don't get me wrong, the pizza here is great.  Simple choices, great flavor and a very hip ambiance.  Pizzas are made to order and salads are fresh daily.  I really enjoy eating at this restaurant."}
{"text":"My colleagues wanted to go out for pizza, and I wasn't thrilled since we have way too much of it at home. This pizza was probably the best I've ever had though! I don't know if it was the crust, the cheese, the sauce, or the combination, but I ate three pieces!"}
{"text":"I love going to Grimaldi's...I am never disappointed so I make it a regular stop. Prices are reasonable and the staff complete's the experience. Kudo's to Joel, the host, it starts with him and his great customer service and winning smile and goes all the way through servers and cooks. A MUST experience if you love great pizza...in a fantastic atmosphere!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. That has to have been the BEST pizza I've ever had. We ordered two pizzas, one margarita and one with sun dried tomatoes, sausage, and meatballs. Both were spectacular. The crust was thin and crispy, with just the right amount of sauce to cheese ratio. The toppings tasted extremely fresh and the pizza was not oily. I'm one of those people who dab the pizza with a napkin if I see oil on it, but this time I didn't have to! They use a coal oven to cook their pizzas, which results in a very crispy crust. I heard they take Las Vegas water, purify it, and turn it in to the same composition as NY water for their pizza dough. I'm not sure if that's their secret or the oven, but it was delicious!   After eating tons of pizza we were stuffed but....we decided to order dessert! And boy, were we not disappointed. We split a cannoli and yum it was delicious. The exterior shell was crisp, as if it was just stuffed! The filling was creamy and sweet, but not too sweet. The atmosphere was very pleasant, and the service was wonderful and attentive. The parking was also great. Since it's in a shopping mall area, there are a ton of spots. Plus, after eating about half a large pizza each (8 big slices in a large pizza) we were able to go shopping!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness - I just discovered true Pizza Nirvana!!!  Hubby and I and the son went there for dinner tonight - it was my first time there.  Had a very nice and knowledgable server named Colin.  He really added to the experience.  But let's discuss the food first...  The pizza nirvana comes from a coal fired oven and the ingredients all come from the same supplier that provides the ingredients for the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge.  We each order a personal sized pizza - I was thinking it would be the size of a \"normal\" personal pizza or I would have definitely shared - a personal sized pizza is the same size as a medium anywhere else.  (I am already craving the leftover pie that is sitting on my counter right now)..  Hubby got a pizza with sausage ($11 for a heavenly 6 slice pie).  I ordered a white pizza with fresh garlic, basil and tomatoes ($14).  Our son ordered a personal cheese pizza ($9).  We all shared a personal sized caesar salad ($6) - which was huge - more than enough to share - it was very delicious and the croutons were baked in the coal fired oven which added a nice balance)!  I bit into my first slice and experienced pure bliss.  Perfectly thin with a great chew and a nice char.  It was charred - not burnt!  So hard to find that here.  This pizza is as close to perfect as I have ever had (but I have not been able to experience real New York pizza yet ).  Colin was great - very knowledgeable without being annoying.  He was very friendly and proud of the food he served.  Everyone we came across working there were also very nice.  I also had a great glass of fresh brewed iced tea (something that is getting harder and harder to find here) - Very refreshing.  We were going to say no to dessert but Colin twisted our arm and we shared a slice of cheesecake ($5) - I am so glad he did.  I normally do not like cheesecake very much - but it was velvet bliss.  Our bill came to under $60.00 with a whole pizza that was left to take home with us.  We will definitely be back in the very near future."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this chain.  Pizzas are great, atmosphere is fun, salads are fresh and large and prices are fair for what you get.  I eat here as often as I can."}
{"text":"There are a couple of these joints on the Vegas Strip - the one we went to was within the Fashion Show Mall directly across from where the so-called 'fashion show' happens. As such, this is a very busy location. We went at 3pm on a weekend and we still had to wait for a table for two. They serve New York style pizza, which was really good. Would definitely go back next time."}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience. I had been a fan of Grimaldi's for a long time but a while ago I visited with my mother. Everything was going great until they brought out my salad.  I had finished about half of it then I noticed something unusual. The place is so dark I could make out what it was. I turned on my phone's flashlight and moved it around with my fork. It was a DEAD FLY!  It hadn't just landed because it looked like it had been soaking either in the dressing or drowned when they washed the the lettuce.  I thought that I would be nice and tell them manager in a low voice which I didn't receive a thanks for she just said \"oh\" and took my plate.  What made me angry was that we didn't receive an apology.  I just walked out and haven't stepped in a Grimaldi's ever since. JUST KEEP A LOOK OUT!"}
{"text":"Amazing brick oven pizza. I ordered chicken, sausage and mushrooms."}
{"text":"Four of us stayed at TI for a college reunion and were looking for nearby cheap places to get food. Grimaldi's showed up on my Yelp app, so we decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad we did!  We had a large pizza with pepperoni and black olives ($18) and a personal-sized pesto pizza ($10).  It was more than enough food for the four of us, plus 6 leftover slices, and we were all starving.  Those 6 slices sure came in handy when we staggered back from the club 6 hours later... :)  The pizza was outstanding.  It was thin-crust and had real slices of fresh mozzarella (you can tell when you see the round blobs on the pizza rather than the uniform coating that most commercial pizzas have) and deliciously salty pepperoni.  The black olives were a little too salty for some of us, so we would probably sub those out next time for something else.  The quality of the pizza was definitely right for the price.  I called ahead and walked over to Fashion Show Mall from TI (about 10-15 minutes), and our order was ready when we got there.  (HINT: it's all the way at the \"back\" of the mall by Dillard's in Zone D on the lower floor, near Chipotle).  The lady on the phone and the server who rang us up were both very nice, and the ambiance of the restaurant is very cute and intimate, so I would definitely come back to eat in as well.  If you are looking for a fast, inexpensive and tasty meal for a group, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA!!!  Gosh I love Grimaldis! Eastern and Palazzo definitely have the best (the one on rainbow isn't as great)   I've eaten here countless amounts of time. It's so good-- seriously eat this and you'll never look back!  YUM!"}
{"text":"We lived across the street from this restaurant for almost two years and only ate there a handful of times (and we literally eat out every night).  The pizza is fantastic when hot, but not great the next day.  The hubby disagrees.     The staff is incredibly helpful and eager to please.  Though most of my experiences have been with their takeout, I would recommend eating in with a group.  Grimaldi's is great for rehearsal dinners and business/club meetings, as they are one of a few restaurants in old town with banquet rooms."}
{"text":"I can't really complain too much...the servers/hosts were nice and the service was quick.  But that's really all the good I can say too.  The pizza was bland, as was the staff.  I won't eat here again, as I try to save my eating out money for yummy places."}
{"text":"Brooklyn pizza was outstanding. Service was great and not overly crowded. They could probably upgrade the TVs as they are a bit small and lack quality high definition.   The outside seating is very nice and the decor is great. They even let the kids play with some pizza dough while you wait for food.  Definitely will eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Very good Pizza.  Good Service and the Wine wasn't bad either.  Would definitely recommend and visit again."}
{"text":"We visited the Scottsdale Quarter location and this pizza is so good.  Had extra cheese and meatball and it was hot and delicious!  Great vibe, and fast, friendly service.  The location is new so everything is clean and the staff is sparkly - great brand execution.  Will return many more times."}
{"text":"Can't sat much other than not impressed. pizzas are hand crafted but poorly at that. they looked slapped together and the crust looked dry. taste was fine but appearance is always key to food. salads were drenched in dressing and overly sour. overall would not eat here again too much hype for nothing."}
{"text":"A cozy and fun atmosphere, with amazing pizza.  Great thin crust with a variety of toppings. I recommend getting basil for a fresh and authentic Italian taste. And you can't leave without getting cheesecake. It's creamy, delicious, and a great ending to a fantastic pizza.  It's  better than Cheesecake Factory's because its creamy but not to thick to where Factory's is so thick and filling.  There is no way you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  Most authentic I've had on the west coast.  Fresh, quality ingredients, fantastic atmosphere at a fair price.  A gem!!"}
{"text":"Always get the same thing...jalapeno and meatball pizza. Never disappointed. I love that the cheese on this pizza is fresh monzerella not the regular block cheese kind."}
{"text":"Great environment, great food, great drinks, great service. The only downside is the wait is over an hour on the weekend and the pizza is cooked fresh which takes about 30 minutes once you order. Well worth the wait and the kids have plenty to look at and big windows to look out of while waiting. Also, plenty of good shopping to do while waiting to be seated. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love grimaldis, it's our favorite pizza place for sure. This one is no exception. It can get busy so there is a wait sometimes but it is worth waiting for."}
{"text":"WARNING...MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT YOUR BILL!  We have always liked Grimaldi's pizza and atmosphere until a recent experience in oldtown Scottsdale.  Not only did our bartender added on a couple of drinks to our bill, but yelled at us when we politely pointed out the mistake.  His outraged reactions only confirmed our suspicions that he was trying to pocket the difference of not only our gracious tip, but an extra $50.  It's sad to say I will not be going back for they do have good pizzas!"}
{"text":"I miss new York and the real Grimaldi's pizza. This is disappointing. Ordered 2 pizzas and would rather pay double for one slice in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"I love this pizza!  Their salads are great too.  Especially the Mediterranean.  Always have had great service.  I eat here whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had since Bianco. Why would I wait 3-5 hours downtown when I can slide down Glentucky to grab a hand tossed pie and homemade tiramisu? Not to mention, my parents said the pizza was on par with or better than what they've had in Italy."}
{"text":"Me and my wife love this place, although it makes me feel like a pig because i will put down a whole large pizza by myself because it is so good.  We take full advantage of the birthday coupons and it keeps us coming back even when we dont have a coupon."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, Pizza in AZ just isn't the same.  I hunt high and low like a starved Mountain Lion for good pizza out here.  I prefer NY style.  Real NY style.  Like downtown, side of the road mom and pop Brooklyn NY pizza.  Big slices, perfectly melted mozzerella, thin crust, great sauce.  It is hard to find in AZ.    Grimaldi's is definitely one the best pizza places I have found out here.  I also recommend Famous Ray's.  If you;re looking for good pizza in AZ, you can't go wrong with Grimaldi's.    It is a bit pricey if you like toppings, but worth it if you like pizza as much as I do."}
{"text":"Simply the best coal-fired brick-oven pizza and friendliest staff in town. Authentic Brooklyn Bridge pies. Generous portions, top-quality fresh ingredients and conscientious, friendly service. Becky, Mikaela, Cody and Danica at the bar are all happy to share their knowledge and passions of the extensive, well-appointed wine list. Simple food menu: Pizza, Calzone, Salad, Dessert, all scrumptiously prepared.  This clean comfortable restaurant gets busy most nights. If you like unhurried, quiet, not-crowded dining, try arriving at 4 or so while they are finishing up restoking the oven. Also, if you like a little heat, try the spicy chicken sausage topping."}
{"text":"I have not been to Phoenix/Scottsdale for a few years and have been craving Grimaldi's as we use to go there at least once a week for the meatball pizza...  Just returned from Scottsdale and was somewhat disappointed with Grimaldi's... Definitely not as good as I remember it...  Meatballs were kinda dry and the pizza was just not as good as in the past.  Maybe it is just this new location in the Scottsdale Quarters...  Next time I'm back, will have to try the old location on Pima in North Scottsdale to see if it's any better!"}
{"text":"Love love love Grimaldis pizzas  ! I always have the personal pizza (tomato and cheese) with fresh basil. The personal pizza is $9 and the topping you add are $ 2 or $4. Yes the pizza I have looks like very basic but the thin crust is so good and for me nothing more is needed. I also tried the red house wine ($5 the glass). It was not one of the best I had but for the price it was good."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's, Grimaldi's.... I just can't quit you.  Pizza is hardly what one thinks of when out to Vegas what with the plethora of buffets, and star-studded chef restos. But Grimaldi's is the little pizzeria that could. Why don't you come out West young Man, I know you would be a starh Baby!  Serious, Grimaldi's got chops and since they are now in the Palazzo it's a lot easier to get a pie fix. I opted for the calzone this time and of course I wasn't disappointed the only gripe (and it's minor) is that the cost of the extras on a calzone IMHO is a tad over-priced. But the bread crust is amazing, the sauce is molte bella, and Grimaldi's would certainly make a top 5 on anyone's pizzeria list."}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:30 pm on a Sunday and were told they were cleaning the oven and pizza would not be made until 5:20 pm. The weekends are a time of people getting out and having late lunches or early dinners.   I've only heard good things about this place but unfortunately I will never spend any of my hard earned money here."}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food!!  Ask for Mariah, best waitress ever!!! One of my favorite pizza places."}
{"text":"First time Grimaldi's pizza experience was a carry out Brooklyn Bridge pizza. Way over priced but the taste was disappointing. I should have gotten a Digiorno."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of pizza from many places around the country. And I have to say, this is the best pizza I've ever had. My wife and I shared a 18\" margherita , I added jalapeños on my half. Everything thing about it was perfect. The crust was crisp, delicious, and did not flop. Perfectly cooked. The sauce was excellent, as well as the basil. It all worked together.  We also got the dessert sampler. I was so full, but I could not stop eating. I left in a food coma. I really think I could eat this every day."}
{"text":"Never have I described cheese on a pizza to be \"Rubbery\" until now.  Yikes!  Is this normal for this establishment?  I get that pizza can be oily but YIKES!  I had to paper towel my slices before eating."}
{"text":"From a pizza fanatic... hands down the best pizza I have ever ate. Just wished I lived a litte closer."}
{"text":"I placed a to go order and had personal size with onions, olives and red peppers, it's probably the best pizza i've ever had.  The personal size is 12\" so it's the size of a medium at most other places. The personal cheese pizza is $9.99 but I had to pay $8 for just 3 toppings, but once I got to eat it, it felt it was well worth the price.  I would definitely recommend it to pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's, what can I say I'm hooked... Love your antipasta salad and your brick oven pizza. Tonight I'm getting it to go because I'm moving but always a nice dining experience!  Very consistent food and good service! Muah"}
{"text":"Everytime we've been here it has been great food and service. In my opinion it is the best pizzeria in the valley. The servers are so friendly and are great at suggesting wine to go with our pizza. We have been coming here for over a year and we have never been disappointed. Eat here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Service is exceptional and the manager stops by every table to welcome and greet customers. Ya gotta love em!"}
{"text":"We love Grimald's! I have been to several locations and each one is as good as the next. Old town Scottsdale location has a great patio for events or just a nice dinner under romantic lighting."}
{"text":"Five friends met to share dinner and conversation and we were totally disappointed this week, especially in light of the recommendations from others that this was the best place in town.  The service was great, the atmosphere was fine, however the pizza was less than average.  Very expensive for a crust that was \"cracker like\".  We all ordered different pizzas, the Don, plain cheese/mushroom, a meat lovers and a veggie.  The sauce was less than average and two of us commented that we could get a Trader Joe's frozen pizza that would taste better.  We all said the same thing...we can scratch this place off the list for the future.  We are originally from New York, New Jersey, Las Vegas and Chicago.  We all agreed it isn't worth a second trip.  My dead grandmother could still make better pizza than these guys."}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza & the Mediterranean salad is very good.  We had amazing service,  very friendly staff that made sure we had everything we needed. We had a great experience here.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants great pizza for a night out with family or friends."}
{"text":"Delicious house salad (a large split between 4 people) & pizza! Very cool wine bottle chandelier. You can see the cooks making the dough & pizzas. But our experience was ruined by the terrible, almost non-existent service!!! Our waiter never came back after we had our pizza & we waited a loooong time for the bill. There's no excuse for the service we received with only a few customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I will admit that I am a tough critic on pizza restaurants. I have been making pizza at home for 30 years so I know what type of crust and toppings that I prefer.   Things looked good when we entered the restaurant and I noticed slightly blackened crusts on the pizzas as I enjoy a crisp crust with light toppings. Normally I order a pizza Margarita (tomato and basil) as it gives me a good idea of the quality of the ingredients and the crust structure and flavor. In this case, I also ordered some of the red peppers as an additional topping. The pizza that was delivered to the table was quite a disappointment. Smothered in sliced tomatoes, the moisture of the tomatoes and the peppers made a very soggy crust I expect a thin crust to be slightly crisp not wet and and soft. I don't mind paying $24 for a pizza (basic pizza $16+$4 for peppers+$2 for tomatoes+$2 for basil) but it really needs to be exceptional. This one was not. By the way, I have never before been charged extra for basil on my pizza!  The Mediterranean salad was OK (large, $10) and service was prompt although my half empty water glass was never re-filled.  Maybe this is a good place to sit on the outside patio for a drink or two but I think that  their main and only dish, pizza, is really not up to par especially for the price. I would prefer Sammy's or Metro any day."}
{"text":"High expectations fell short.... Have seen the one in Old Town Scottsdale and heard \"rave reviews\" so anticipated a happening scene with fab wood fired oven pizza for a New Year's dinner.  Perhaps my Lasik surgery the day before altered my perception in ways I had not anticipated but I really thought that Chuck-e-cheese himself was going to saunter through the dinning room at any moment.   The white pizza left everything that white pizza is somewhere in the kitchen. Thankfully my tastebuds were rescued by the sausage, ricotta and roasted red pepper pie. A few salads and of course pizza at +$2 per topping.   Luckily we had a fun group there and I'll have to think about going back. I think I'll stick to my local favorites for truly amazing pizza like Nello's and Four Peaks."}
{"text":"I love the pizza. As for the people... Well not much. Employes are not that friendly at all. Always have to wait like if it's a privilege just to get waited on by someone. It's obvious something is wrong or they might actually be smile at someone. They just kind of stare like : \"what do you want\"? It's unfortunate."}
{"text":"I love eating here! The first time I ate here the manager introduced himself and was very kind in making sure everything was to our satisfiaction. I think his name was John but not sure...  Very social man. I have always received great service at this location in Gilbert. I also always bring my guests here to eat. The beer is always cold and the pizza is great. The only problem is on the weekends there is always a wait unless you find a spot at the bar. LOL    I have also eaten at the Chandler location and everyone there is really nice but the Scottsdale location people can be quite moody at times. The Scottsdale location is somewhat hit and miss with the employees. It almost seems like if it isn't there job title then they are almost unwilling to help you but like I said it's hit and miss."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's opened in Summerlin recently and am I happy. One of the best pizzas in Las Vegas. They spread the cheese different than other pizza places in that it's put on in drops, so there's drops of cheese and drops of sauce. It's no wonder they have 13 locations in Vegas, Arizona and Texas. They do pizza right. The sauce is delicious. Real pizza sauce, not spicy and no tomato chunks. They have an outside eating area that's very comfortable, but the pizza gets cold out there. Stay away from the high priced drinks and a large pizza with drink will be under $20, not counting tip."}
{"text":"Their pizza is amazing!! The crust is a perfect thin,  cheese is  never greasy, the dressing on their Cesar salad is perfect and the cheesecakes ( I've tried Oreo, strawberry and pumpkin) are the best. I would even say  better than the eatery down the way that's named after theirs!"}
{"text":"I have not yet been to New York but if the pizzas taste like this, it's delicious !!!! This place is beautiful inside and out. The servers are extremely friendly. The small pizza is enough for two. You sort of get to build your own pizza, pick the toppings of your choice. I had pepperoni, mushroom, bell pepper, meatball, and black olives on my pizza. I like how the pizza was thin crust, those are the best plus the pepperonis are small. Two draft beers selected off the menu, Fat Tire and Blue Moon. I'd definitely come back again for the pizza !!!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley!  The main dining room gets crazy with kids in the evening, but the bar area and outside patio are great!  This location and Old Town are consistently good, but the Scottsdale Quarter location is hit or miss.  Overall, love Grimaldis!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Grimaldi's pizza and when this location opened within a mile of my house I was fired up that I didn't have to drive to DC Ranch or Old Town every time I wanted my fix.  Well, ~2 years later and I'm still driving right past this location.  Don't get me wrong, it is GOOD pizza...just not nearly as consistently good as the other 2 locations here.  Every couple months I get lazy and go back here, but they are so inconsistent that it keeps driving me away.  For some reason they can't seem to control the temp in the oven and the crust comes out either tough or burnt on too many occasions."}
{"text":"I never wanted to wait in the long lines in Brooklyn to try this infamous pizza.  Now I know the reason for the lines under the venerable Brooklyn Bridge - it isn't just a tourist thing - as far as NY pizza goes, this is as good as I have had.  Everything was fresh and outstanding - the pizza, the salad and the desserts (cheesecake, tiramasu & cannoli)."}
{"text":"The pizza as well as the service were very good. I ate their version of a white pizza (garlic and olive oil) and a traditional. They were both amazing. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is it's not as tasty as Santarpios  in Boston. That's my favorite pizza of all times. I compare everything to Santarpios."}
{"text":"One thing you should never do is communicate to the customer that you are not a priority because other tables and and then bring out the food in the wrong order. This wasn't even a busy night and couldn't get the order out correctly. This is not the Grimaldi's we've known and loved for years. New management???"}
{"text":"From NY to LV, this is by far one of the best pizza places I have been to. They always have fresh and very tasty ingredients and the pizza is consistently this crust and made to perfection.  They have a small selection of draft beer but you are bound to find something you like on the list. The staff are very friendly, curtious and super helpful.  I would highly recommend everyone come over if you don't feel like going to the one on the strip.   Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to New York pizza in Vegas. I am from NYC so I know everything about pizza. Their is thin and doesn't have to much grease. The tomato sauce is pretty flavorful as well. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Waited in line, asked to be seated in the patio area in front of the store, hostess decided to give the table to someone else, that was not cool"}
{"text":"Awesome! We had the most wonderful time dining here tonight. In fact, we are still here finishing up our delectable tiramisu and latte. The pizza taste just like the one I've had in Brooklyn. Nice thin crust with a flavorful red sauce. My nephew had pepperoni and sausage and believe me they were not holding back on the meat! I had the meatball personal size pizza and lots leftovers. Twelve inches is very large for a personal size pizza. We took home our leftovers. We also had the red house wine in the half carafe. What a deal for $9!  The wine was delicious. No bitter after taste or sour note. It was smooth. The service here was impeccable. Jess was amazing! She was friendly, personable and took care of us. Even her manager Ashley came to our table and spoke with us. We will definitely come back here with a larger group for sure. If you're looking for good authentic thin crust NY style pizza, this is the place!!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC GOURMET PIZZA. The cheese was tasty the sauce was amazing and the crust was my favorite part. I got a sausage and pepperoni and they were both fantastic the pepperoni was spectacular. AMAZING"}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA and THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER! (Homemade cheesecake) I recommend the Peanut butter cup cheesecake. We were in a group of ten and everyone commented on how great the pizza was. Pesto pizza was the favorite for my wife. The place runs a little on the expensive side but we all thought it was worth it. I would recommend eating here when the local papa johns/dominoes type places wont cut it and you want some pizza that is on the gourmet side."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent and the GM Brian is so welcoming and professional. You would think he owned the place. Will definitely be back all though I live in Seattle!"}
{"text":"We entered the door at 5:48pm last night and were seated on the patio at 5:52pm.  The waitress never came to our table so at 6:03pm I got up and went to the front desk to let the hostess & manager know.  They apologized and sent someone right over.  My wife asked about the happy hour menu and she said because it was after 6pm that she could not honor anything on the happy hour menu.  I told her that we had been seated since 5:52pm but she just apologized and said there was nothing she could do.  Needless to say, this was very poor judgment on her part and the manager should have comp'd the first round of drinks for the long wait.  Oh well, we probably would think twice about returning because of this."}
{"text":"Went here since it was close by.  It was good. It was pizza. We ate it. As Chicagolanders, we did not complain.  Pros: Greek Salad was fresh and not drowned in too much dressing. Cheerful atmosphere, good for kids. Crust was decently chewy and the fresh mozzarella is a nice plus.  Cons: Can get pricey. Toppings are $2-$4. (We got onion, red pepper, and sausage. Doesn't have a lot of sauce. I like my pizza saucy.  You can order extra sauce, but why?  Yep. It's pizza."}
{"text":"Busy Christmas Week, Service was good...Ordered Margarita Pizza and Caesar Salad... Salad Was Great !!!  but Pizza was Ok....Not Very Tasty..Had Better Pizza... Bonannos @ Luxor has Great Pizza !!!"}
{"text":"BEST Pizza I've eaten in Vegas so far! The crust is thin but at the same time deliciously fluffy. My favorite is just the regular cheese pizza. I'm plan to try other pizzas out in the near future. Their bar also opens up to the outside on nicer days, so it would be nice to check it out for happy hour, and get a couple beers or a glass of wine when the weather is pretty outside. I'm definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Prior to eating at Grimaldi's Pizza in Peoria I was a fan of the Scottsdale location. I was very excited to learn that a location would be opening up near our home.  This is the best pizza that I've had in the Valley, hands down. We always order a large Pepperoni Pizza with the occasional purchase of a White Pizza. We've also ordered salads and and antipasto and have been pleased every time.  The crust is thin and a little chewy and the quality of the toppings come shining through.  No, the pizza isn't weighed down with tons of toppings, there are enough toppings for every part of the pizza to sing."}
{"text":"I have dreams about their pizza!  You can't get pizza like this anywhere else because of their coal fired ovens.  I love the quatro formagio (spelling?) with bacon added!  Service and ambiance is second to none."}
{"text":"We decided to try Gtimaldi's after reading other reviews...we are so glad we did!!  The pizza was delicious & the service was outstanding. We eat a lot of pizza at different places and this is by far the best we've had. The staff were outstanding too!!  Great experience, any time we are in the Scottsdale area we will eat at Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"love this place! everytime i have lg pepperoni half with jalapenos!.. i always say if it isnt grimaldi's it isnt for me! haha i always tell people about this place and constantly take new friends and relatives and they cant get enough!"}
{"text":"This is a must visit if you are ever near old town Scottsdale. It has a large variety of food and the pizza is some of the best that I have ever had. It has a very family friendly vibe and very authentic. The wait was not long at all and the food comes out surprisingly quick but still delicious. You don't want to miss out on this food!!"}
{"text":"When for lunch and it was just ok, their wasn't anything special about the pizza  this time around, hope I'll crave them again and try again, but not for a while ."}
{"text":"I loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good.  I think if you haven't been there and are at the San Tan Mall shopping that its worth a visit.  We went on a double date and it was a pretty good experience.  The only issue I had was that I thought they had a very small dining area, which was probably the reason for the 45min wait.  Also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud, which I know the management has no control over, but just an fyi of my experience.  I'd say if you haven't been and you love pizza its worth the visit.   I may try and stop in for lunch sometime but definitely not on a Friday night, it was just too busy."}
{"text":"I'm in love here! Service, food, salad and atmosphere are all 5 stars! This place is a close second to Lombardi's in NY. Thats no knock on this place, it's a HUGE compliment in my book. Lombardi's is second-to-none and I put this place right up there. I was amazed. This is my new favorite pizza joint anywhere!! Great job to my servers/bartender. Will def be back.  Peace!!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! From the hostess to our server (Stephanie) and the manager who checked on us twice and served us our first slice of pizza. I thought that was awesome! Mediterranean salad was so light and tasted so fresh. Pepperoni pizza was great. Quality products were used in both dishes. Red Sangria was good. Great food and prices. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Pretty pizza with very average taste. This is no comparison to their NY counterpart which is no doubt only related in name.  Another issue with this place is the cooks handling all the pizza dough and ingredients with BARE hands! Gross!"}
{"text":"Well worth the 25 minute wait to get a table. Top quality ingredients prepared with intellect and skill and sold at a reasonable price. We need a location in Payson."}
{"text":"We were going to this location once a month, but service has been going downhill with the last 3 visits. Our most recent experience had us waiting for our one dish longer than people who arrived after us! We were done with our drinks by the time our calzone arrived, 30 + minutes after ordering it. After complaining, our waitress didn''t offer us anything, not even a free drink. we even had to ask for water. Service has been getting worse and worse there. Before this we had a waiter who took our money we paid for the check, stuck it in his pocket, and gave us change from his pocket. This same waiter argued with another waiter in front of our table about stealing tips. Food is always excellent....but this was our last time at this location!!"}
{"text":"I heard an advertisement on the radio about Grimaldi's and thought I would try their pizza. I called Grimaldi's and learned that they were located 23 miles from where I live. I went to Grimaldi's and ordered a pizza for take out. I arrived approximately 4:50 PM the young adult who took my order said the pizza would be ready at 5:25 PM and for me to come back at that time. I went to the bar and ordered a beer and watched their TV. At 5:25 I went to pick up my order and the waiter said it would be a couple of more minutes. A couple of more minutes turned out to be 12 more minutes.  When I finally received my pizza I went to my car to start back to my home and decided to eat a slice. When I took a bite I couldn't believe what all the hype was about their pizza because the pizza that I got the cheese was stringing and it took a while to chew. I wasn't impressed with Grimaldi's pizza especially paying 27 dollars for a small pizza."}
{"text":"Bad service and bland pizza. I waited for 15 minutes for my server after I was done eating to request she bring my check. I had to let the busser know and he went and got her. The pizza was so bland, like eating cardboard with sauce and cheese. Will not return to this place."}
{"text":"This place was amazing I would love if they made more restaurants if it was possible I would rate it 10 stars"}
{"text":"I thought that I would really like the pizza here a lot more.  Previously enjoyed it as take-out at a friend's place.  However, my sausage pizza was way too soggy, in fact it was down right wet in the middle."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, Terrible service. Would not go back on that count. Unless you spend a ton of money on drinks, you will not be treated with respect by server (at least the one we had--and that is all I can go on). Management seemed friendly but since they do nothing to train  their servers in manners and friendliness, I can't give them too much credit. Advice: take your servers into a 3 hour meeting on what polite, friendly, welcoming service should be and then let them out on the floor. Thanks."}
{"text":"Service was okay. Eh, the pizza is well... a little grim. Ordered the pepperoni and sausage pizza. The meat tasted weird. Sauce was okay. I spent $38 for a lousy pizza and a few drinks.   Nothing special about this place. No reason to return.   I've had better."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza place in Gilbert! I came in with my wife and two daughters for my birthday (Grimaldis emailed me a birthday coupon for a free pizza). The service was fantastic. Right when I walked in, the two hosts were extremely nice when they greeted us and sat us right away. Our server Tyler was very personable and attentive. We took his recommendation on our pizza and we were not disappointed! Overall great service, we'll certainly be back again soon."}
{"text":"Had another great meal and dining experience at girmaldis Scottsdale quarter.  The manager Marla, goes above and beyond to make sure everyones happy.  Marla is the best, she recommended the best wine to go with our calzone, it was delish. Thanks Marla your the best.   Girmaldis is a great place to go for wonderful service and the best pizza and calzones in Scottsdale.."}
{"text":"This pizza has no flavor. The crust was good but that's really it. Totally disappointed."}
{"text":"We have been eating at this Grimaldi's location for over a decade because we really like the pizza, which we get twice a month but today's experience justifies this one star review because we were astounded and infuriated. I ordered pizzas by phoning in. My husband went in to pick them up and witnessed the server cut our pizza and remove a slice before handing us the box. We ordered three pizzas so when she handed over the pizzas she only showed the top two. At first they denied doing it, and then offered to make another pizza because clearly there was a missing slice... easy math when the original shape is a circle and a wedge is visible in the box. With 4 hungry kids at home my husband did not want to wait half an hour for a replacement pizza. The manager refunded him for the error, without really admitting to the incident. I come from years of working in restaurants and I would have fired anyone who I caught stealing from the business, and stealing from a paying customer. Grimaldi's please address this issue. How many of your to-go customers have been cheated from their full order in this fashion? My husband has a photo of the pizza and a photo of the manager and offending server if you plan to see this through."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent, and I don't think it was just because I was starving from moving into a new house all day. We got a large with pepperoni and artichokes. They use the fresh mozzarella which gives it a really great flavor and texture as opposed to the generic brick mozzarella. My only beef would be the $16 for the \"base\" cheese pizza and an extra $6 for toppings (artichokes being a whopping 4 bucks), which seems a little steep. I guess it was worth it though. The tomato sauce was on the sweet side, but I love that. We just got it take-out so I can't comment on the service or the ambience of the restaurant, it could stink for all I know. Great pizza though."}
{"text":"A great pizza restaurant, and a top pizza place in Vegas along with Settebello in The District.  The one drawback for me (because I'm sort of cheap) is that it's pricey.  I am not a fan of places that have a base price for the food that's already pricey and then charge additional $1-2 for each topping.  The pizza though is good; once you eat good pizza, it's hard to go back to crap like Little Caesar's.  (Although LC's and $5 pizzas got me through law school.)      Customer service is excellent, much better than Settebello.  Overall, I'm a fan but find it's a \"once in awhile\" outing."}
{"text":"So this is the best pizza on the west coast (maybe anywhere).  I am a pizza addict and the best pizza is from Grimaldis. The coal fired brick oven gives a beautiful char flavor to the crust, the mozzarella is super fresh and high in the crust, perfect thin NY crust, delicious sauce....seriously perfect pies.  My wife is an Italian from New York with a strong 100% Italian family- When she bit into Grimaldis pizza, the look on her face was priceless. She was shocked that I brought home real, Italian pizza in Scottsdale. Even she agrees that Grimaldis is unbelievable and it's now the only place she will get pizza from."}
{"text":"Well as a long time customer ( since opening week) I have notice the service going down the drain in the quality of the food making up for it. my last visit about a month ago the service was just the worst ever it took 20 minutes before a someone in the acknowledged that we wore there, BUT I REALLY like the PIZZA....... So I deal with it. But tonight DINING with Roaches out-side was just too much. they wore every were. I even had one craw on my feet. finally I got so tired of it and already had said something about it got up and went and took a seat at the bar as the waitress still offers me and the rest of my party dessert.... Of course i said i did not want to have to share with the roaches and all she had to say was that the manager said that they sprayed in the morning and hands me the full bill no I am sorry's or at least the manager to come and say something. OH WELL ....."}
{"text":"I go to this place every week. The staff is AMAZING. Every week it seems to get better and better. The sausage and onion pizza is great along with their cheesecake. I highly recommend to any pizza/cheesecake lover :)"}
{"text":"They have Antipasto the way I like it - it's a plate rather than a salad, and it's awesome.  I have those days where I feel like grazing rather than eating a meal, and this is the perfect thing.  I can snack on cheese, olives, and salami as I feel like it and it keeps well in the fridge.  (takeout of course)   I've also had their caprese - which is good but I've been spoiled by another restaurant that has an awesome balsamic reduction for theirs.    I've heard the pizza here is great, and it certainly smells awesome, but I haven't tried it.  I really like their food, but occasionally they forget to include things in my order, and having to run back to a restaurant to pick up a missed item is -1 star...."}
{"text":"No matter who visits us a trip to Grimaldis makes the right impression. Never have bad service and the food never disappoints. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait but as they say \"all good things come to those who wait\"!"}
{"text":"The pizza and calzones were great. Waiter has to many tables and forgot to put out order in but the waiter Aaron was honest and told us he had not put it in. The manager offered a desert but we did not want it. Our waiter had told the manger to go back but he was busy on his phone. Waiter was great but manager was not."}
{"text":"This place has the best thin crust pizza i ever had. The cocktails were delicious and the bartender Tushumbi was friendly and attentive. I ordered a lemon drop and my husband had a marguerite both were tasty. We will definitely go back the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"As always the pizza was delicious but the service was terrible! I had a group of 8 last night, we all enjoyed the food but would had preferred a better experience. The hostess was too confused to get things right, apparently Grimaldis cannot handle big parties, they get too overwhelmed! The service deserves one star, even the manager was no help!"}
{"text":"Well, I am back to re-rate this place. Father's Day found me and the family out and about. Unfortunately, the service here was...well I am not sure it is considered service. We arrived and were given the option of waiting thirty (30) minutes or sitting outside. Opting for the outdoor seating, and given the heat, we expected a waiter that would at least make sure we had something to drink.  The service started out normal with drinks coming out fairly quickly; however, that was the end of the pleasantries. Again, with the heat, our drinks went rather quickly. Our empty glasses sat for roughly 10 minutes before our waiter (Vanessa) came back to refill them. Seated outside, we had no clue where our waiter was most of the time because we only saw her three times: 1) when she took our order, 2) when she refilled our drinks (for the first and only time), and 3) when she brought us the check. To make matters worse, the waiter helping the people across from us was doing an excellent job (i.e., refilling drinks, conversing, and checking on the quality of the food). It was like night and day between the waiters.   Overall, our waiter was either ready to clock out or just didn't care about us. Again, the food is good, but the service can be ridiculously bad. It was not a nice way to spend a Father's Day."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza. The mozzarella cheese had a very rich flavor.  I've been looking for a pizza place like this for a while. The manager Julio came by our table twice even when the dining room was packed. Great service, excellent food. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"What a great place for pizza. Everything about the food was perfect. The dough, the sauce (amount of and flavor) the cheese, the amount of grease even! I had the pepperoni and kalamata olive pizza, the olives were fresh and delicious as well.   I have also visited the Grimaldi's in Texas (Allen) - they really keep all their restaurants in great condition all with really fresh ingredients.  It seemed like it was a date place too, lots of dates going on when I was there, that always makes for good people watchin'"}
{"text":"NY style pizza at the Vegas Strip, what's not to like?!?!  Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a welcome addition to the strip, with its affordable prices and authentic pizza pies you can't go wrong!  They have a simple menu and a great ambiance, it looks like a little slice of NY (but cleaner) right here in Vegas.  The menu is basically the toppings that you can choose from as well as the sauce (try not to go over 3 items on the pizza cause then the crust gets a little soggy), then they have a couple salads and of course cannolis and dessert to round out the menu for good measure.  Now the desserts/cannolis are really good, the salads, leave a bit to be desired.  The service that I have personally received has been pretty good, and of course the pizza itself is great!  So stop by and try out a few different types of pizza if you have a chance, and if you happen not to like it, guess what fuggetaboutit!"}
{"text":"The pizza at Grimaldi's is 5 star worthy, but I have to knock them down one star for their prices. I knew what to expect because I've eaten at a Grimaldi's in Dallas and Charleston before, but still, it's expensive pizza considering they charge $3-5 per topping. What brought me in to this location is that I received a coupon for a Free Large Pizza with 1 Topping for my birthday, thanks to signing up for their email club (Thank you, Grimaldi's)!   Their shaded patio with misters and string lights was a nice spot to dine on a warm weekday afternoon. I was seated and greeted promptly, and checked on appropriately throughout the meal. For food, I had a small Caesar salad which could've been split with someone. Was it good? Yes, it tasted like every other Caesar salad I've ever had. Worth $8? Probably not. I'd prefer a smaller serving size for a smaller price, as $8 felt like a bit much for what it was really worth. The pizza however, was delicious! I love the thin, crispy crust and red sauce. I only had room for 2 slices at lunch, but am eager to have the rest as leftovers! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant for an upscale pizza night."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a great pizza place since we moved to Las Vegas from the mid-west, and FINALLY the search is over! Not only is the pizza TO DIE for.. but the customer service speaks volumes! From the second we walked in this whole staff was ON FIRE! The manager Marla came around and greeted every table there.. and was genuine! She went WAY above and beyond and treated us to a slice of cheesecake because a big group of young soccer boys came in and she appreciated us putting up with them being a little loud! Seriously.. how nice was that! Our waiter Keith was also awesome, and knows how to give you 5 star service!!! Highly recommend GRIMALDI'S PIZZA for anyone looking for a New York style pie! We will be regulars!!! CHEERS!"}
{"text":"While here during spring training and trying to figure out something to eat I decide to use yelp for some help. I was looking up all sorts of places until I thought maybe pizza might be a good choice. Also was going to meet up with a friend who was in town for business. That never happened, but dinner did.   Looking over the menu before heading over to the restaurant helped. I knew what to expect and found stuff that I could like. Looked over the menu and ordered a half cheese and half pesto large pizza. I also ordered the fresh mozzarella and tomato basil. It was pretty good. I then ate the pizza and didn't notice anything special about it, except that the pesto on top of the cheese. CHEESE?! Yes, it was on top of the cheese. I didn't notice it was salty until the person I ate with tried it. It was salty and they like salt.   I'd come back again and the fact they have outdoor indoor seating was good. The outside was windy and they have a patio area inside that was good. Overall full and decent prices for a meal."}
{"text":"I was shocked on how good the pizza was.  I admit that I prejudged the restaurant and thought it was a typical chain restaurant. However, that changed once I took my first bite of my white garlic pizza. Excellent pizza!  Grimaldi's allows you to choose what type of pizza - white, red - and then add your own toppings.  There are no pre-decided pizzas with chosen toppings, I believe."}
{"text":"Went with my sons and waited at counter, finally someone came and seated us, no greeting or anything. The waitress was very good, when we laeft evertone got a greeting on way out except us, wont be going back!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! We come here sometimes 2 or 3 times a month. It can get crowded sometimes, but if you know your server, it makes things a whole lot better. In the end, the pizza here is AWESOME. Our favorite is the Meatball Pizza. It sounds odd, but there really isn't large balls of meat on this pizza. The meatballs are sliced nice and thick and completely cover this thing adding a basil leaf or 2 to round it out. If you want to get crazy, add a little garlic powder to this mix and you have an amazing pizza that will keep you coming back. I always insist that we order a large even though there are only 2 of us. Why? Because the cold pizza in the morning is OUTSTANDING!!!  This place uses fresh ingredients, their kitchen is in full view of the entire restaurant, and the food is great. Don't pass this place by!"}
{"text":"Good pizza for a decent price. The blueberry cheesecake was awesome.  Our service was terrible. A 45 minute meal took 90 minutes because our server never checked on us. We had to repeatedly ask for the check. Then we actually asked another server to process the payment because we never saw our server again."}
{"text":"Came here with a local friend (and a group of peeps) for a music video shoot we were working on.  the wait was 20 min food took a while to come out.   the salads were good.  the pizza was all right but not as amazing as other people said . I guess i had high expectations. We also had the calzone ... it was just ok....   lots of parking."}
{"text":"We're on vacation, drove over 4 hours and decided to just have wine and a good Pizza for dinner in the hotel room......well the pizza......smelt really good driving back but when we actually sat down to eat, the pizza is Very Bland.  Nothing pops. Crust is great, but sauce is watery, toppings could be spread a little more evenly. It takes quite a bit to impress me when it comes to pizza. I'd eat it again as long as I don't have to pay for it."}
{"text":"I've had 5 star pizza here on a good day.....and 1 star awful pizza here on a bad day.  Very inconsistent......when I go I usually sit at the bar, and its always very difficult to get the bartender's attention.  I can't speak much for the dining room area, but service at the bar is always pretty bad.  When the pizza is ON though, it makes up for the lack of service."}
{"text":"For me, not being from the East Coast, or Italian, Grimaldi's crust is way too thin. It's almost not there! I prefer a more substantial crust. Doesn't have to be pan pizza, just something to hold the toppings without becoming a soggy, wet piece of paper like substance. Sorry Grimaldi's. My friends, all from the East and all Italian, love it."}
{"text":"A) Very few pizzas are worth waiting hours for and I can promise you this isn't one of them. B) Ordered 2 pizzas at 6:15 for a 7:45 pickup. Arrive at 7:40, they take my money and by 7:50 someone comes out and tells me they're running delayed and it will be another 30 minutes. C) Didn't offer anything but a crappy $5 coupon for next time. A 2+ hour wait for some pizza and that's the best they can do?"}
{"text":"Late night on the strip...munching, cheese pizza was delishhhh & pepperoni n peppercini yummy in my tummy. Decor is decent pizza parlor vibe,bathrooms was questionable."}
{"text":"No. No. No. No. and NO.  Ohhh Grimaldi's your yelp pictures look so good, but you were a disappointment to say the least. So again went here for dinner one night during MLB spring training. Definitely pizza place looking for sure and crowded, so we assumed it would be good. We sat outside, next to a group of obnoxious 12+ 40 year old wannabe 20 year old women plus one dude. They kept referring to their one lesbian looking friend as \"Justin\", which was pretty funny because she did actually look like Justin Beiber.  Our waitress was really nice, but the food took like 40 minutes to get out to us and all we really ordered was pizza and a salad. Their white pizza, absolutely disgusting. No flavor. Too flat. Dry. EW.  Definitely not coming back here..."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had east of the Mississippi. Great thin crust pizza over a charcoal fired grilled. The sauce is is out of this world and the pepperoni is unbelievable. The service is absolutely amazing.  Quick turn around and engaged wait staff. This is the best pizza in Vegas hands down!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. Didn't expect such a find while in Arizona.  Can't wait to go again next   I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to Grimaldi's before and this was my second visit while on a date before heading to Westgate. The service was good and the food was good. However here is where the unprofessional-ism comes in.   After dinner my GF went to the restroom, while in the restroom, a waitress approaches her with a proposition from the Manager named \"Rich\". Stating, \"he wanted to give her his number since he found her so attractive and wanted to know her status with the guy at the table\". This offended her and she declined the offer.   Evidently, this is a common practice by the manager to prey on female patrons as the waitress had no problem assailing her on his behalf. My GF returned embarrassed/offended and wanted to leave immediately; she wouldn't  tell me what was wrong until we exited the restaurant, in order to prevent a scene from occurring.  The manager should really take some classes on business ethics. Patrons are there for the growth of your establishment, not for your own carnal desires."}
{"text":"thin crust .. the cheese!! ohh Lord the cheese!! YESSSSSSS !!!!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I Love Pizza!! Their pizza is world class, make you wanna slap someone, quality pizza!! This place has, dare I say it... the BEST meat lovers pizza on the west coast!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We just moved from the east coast to the strip. We have found our new pizza place. Crust was amazing and sauce was perfection. We had the margherita and pepp, peppers and mushrooms. Pricing was not bad, compared to other pizza restaurants on the strip."}
{"text":"This place is definitely more expensive that we were expecting but worth the money! We have the Margarita pizza and loved it."}
{"text":"The pizza was great, the restaurant was very loud & the service was ok. The pizza is a little pricey but overall good."}
{"text":"I really,liked grimadlis! I actually heard about this from zach on ghost adventure. The pizza is thin crust new york style. The pizza is awesome, and the service is great!"}
{"text":"Ordered a 16\" pepperoni for take-out and it was very good. My boyfriend loved it. I could have used a little more sauce but the mozzarella & pepperoni were both excellent. Menu seemed limited to just pizza and calzones with a few salads which is ok but I sometimes like breadsticks w/ a salad not pizza but it was still a good late night dinner after golfing all day."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. It might be the night but a little loud. Also not enough items if you don't like pizza. Would like to see a more options"}
{"text":"I like Oregano's. I mean, I really like Oregano's. Rare is the occasion that I will not go there for pizza when the urge hits. The problem, it seems, is that everyone likes Oregano's. That usually means terribly long stretches spent in the Boom Boom Room trying to ease the suffering with glass after glass of Sierra Nevada. Yes, poor baby. It usually works. But on a recent occasion when my parents were visiting from out of town, the 120-minute wait time about 8:30 on a Wednesday night was too much to bear.  I've gotten stuck in this trap before. Read the review of Bada Boom Pasta Room to find out what happened the last time I didn't want to wait for a table and went searching for something faster. But wait at Oregano's we were not going to do. So, with heavy hearts and empty stomachs (as the clich might go), up the street we went to Patsy Grimaldi's.  Seating was immediate, albeit cramped. The server was polite, pleasant and attentive. They even had Sierra Nevada, though I refrained and instead drove down about a half dozen Diet Cokes. We talked and took in the comforting environment before loading up on tasty pizza. While Oregano's may not be damned, count me in as a Patsy Grimaldi's fan.  Free street parking is available nearby at the downtown Scottsdale location we were at that night. Galleries and kitschy shops provide entertainment if you're not out too late. And, of course, there are plenty of bars to belly up to after the food fun."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza in Phoenix.  I have tried some of the others like Pizzeria Bianco but I still prefer Grimaldi's.  Its not that I don't like the other places but there is something about that coal fired oven that gives the pizza just an amazing taste and texture that a wood fired oven just can't do.  I agree with with some that the service could be better.  It's not bad, it just could be better.  I forgive them though because I really like their pizza.  Usual we get a white pizza with ham on it and then I get a side of pizza sauce for me (my wife does not like any pizza sauce).  Yummy, Yummy."}
{"text":"I only come here for the olives on the pizza. For some reason, they just taste so fresh. Ingredients are better than other pizza brands, but definitely not good for my health lol. The good thing about this place is you don't have to wait like the Brooklyn location. There is a 1-2 hr wait at their Brooklyn location and yes I waited in the rain. I fell for the tourist trap. Well what else am I going to do? I was a tourist in N.Y. I try to make it to the Vegas location whenever I stay in Vegas. I normally take a box of pizza to go and just leave it in my room at the Palazzo. Sometimes cold pizzas taste so good (doesn't taste all greasy) when you're hungry at 11 PM."}
{"text":"Ate here on vacation and was very very pleased with service and food. Salads were fresh and pizza was delicious. Really happy to find out that there is one of these in my home town and can't wait to try so stay tuned....."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza! The atmosphere is nice, with a long bar and an open kitchen so you can watch them put the pizza's in the large brick oven. Try your pizza with sun dried tomatoes, meatballs and risotto-- so good on that delicious crust. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because I find it so damn irritating that they have the menu on the place mats, but when you sit down there is always a plate over it that you have to move to read the menu! It gets really awkward with a large group and everyone having to hold their plate while reading. Sounds picky, I know, but it's irritating."}
{"text":"Got the free birthday pepperoni pie.  It was a little dry, just not enough sauce on the pie.  The service is excellent though, and the ambiance is good with an italian New York feel."}
{"text":"The staff are pretty nice, not outstanding, but not rude.  The food, though, is outstanding.  Love the sauce, you can taste the sweetness in the sauce.  It doesn't taste like it came out of a can.  The toppings tasted fresh and not mass manufactured.  The crust was great too.    I am not usually one to get too excited about chain restaurants but Grimaldi's is worth it for a really good, gourmet taste, pizza.  Try one of their wines with it too."}
{"text":"Very tasty and a bit expensive but mostly worth it -- unless you want lots of toppings because they charge per topping and it adds up fast.  The pizza was really delicious.  We ordered pepperoni and jalapenos but there were too many jalapenos - close to 10 pieces per slice.  We also ordered a small chicken and artichokes pesto pizza which was good but was really heavily topped with cheese.  Typically a thin crust pizza has fewer toppings than a thicker crust pizza but these were filled with toppings.  The Caesar salad was great, not overly dressed and a small was plenty to split between two people.   Also, a large pizza is 18 inches - so make sure you're hungry!"}
{"text":"Solid brick oven pizza - had the margherita.  The small salads are big enough to split 2 maybe 3 ways.  Waitress / hostess didn't offer my kids dough to play with although there were 3 or 4 tables around us that did.  The kids split a pretty good calzone.  I thought the prices were reasonable for the food quality, but I am having some *ahem* intestinal distress this afternoon.  Reminds me why I almost never eat raw vegetables at restaurants."}
{"text":"My friend said eating in las Vegas was either crappy and unhealthy or expensive. Here is the exception. Great pizza, good basic salad, fresh ingredients and inexpensive. And the service was great too! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is the way all pizza should be made. Being from NY this is the only place that comes close to NY pizza in AZ. Perfect crust, perfect sauce, perfect everything. In fact everything on the menu is worth trying. Except for making my own, this is the only pizza i will ever eat."}
{"text":"A small group of us just celebrated our 50th high school reunion at the Grimaldi's at DC ranch.  They have a great venue for a small group...a private room and patio.  Even though the restaurant itself was slammed with business on Saturday night, our service was impeccable.  The salad and pizzas were the same high quality as usual.  The cheesecake is delicious.  From the moment we arranged our reunion at this site, the managers were quick to answer questions.  They are knowledgeable and offer solid advice about how to plan this type of event.  Special kudos to Aimee who was our bartender/server.  She did a great job making sure everyone had exactly what they wanted, always with a gracious smile.  I highly recommend this Grimaldi's.  They helped us celebrate 50 years in an informal, comfortable setting where we could catch up with friends and not worry about the quality of the venue, service or food."}
{"text":"The best pizza on the planet!! Perfect crust, they inspect every pizza! A must when you're near a Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say I was amazed at the waitresses (Beca) amount of attention to detail and quickness. She was outstanding. The staff was great, host was very nice, manager ( at least I think that's who she was) checked not only on our table but the others as well at least twice. Pizza was delicious and they did not skimp on the toppings. The Mediterranean salad was also full of veggies and not lettuce. Pricing is reasonable but the place has a very upscale feel which I liked. This is definitely a pizza spot you should cost of your in Vegas."}
{"text":"Die beste pizza die ich in den USA je gegessen habe! Dünner leckerer teig, fruchtige tomatensauce! Das konzept der pizza zum selber kreiieren ist einfach das super! Inklusive guter weinempfehlung durch das service personal!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza west of Brooklyn  The reviews are correct:  It is not nearly as good as Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.  But it is oh-so-good.  We get out to Vegas a little more often than NY, and so its the next best thing.   If you live anywhere other than NY, then come here and it will be one of the best pizzas you've ever had!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the service  was excellent. Pleasant surroundings. It was very nice to have such pleasant service and they were very friendly and made our visit that extra special. They went above and beyond their job. Thank you"}
{"text":"Don't know what Simply D is talking about but sounds like those drinks that the bartender \"added\" on not only impaired his typing skills but also his mathematical skills. The drink prices at Grimaldi's are moderately priced, so two drinks adding up to $50?...Think simply D might just like to gripe. I've been in the industry for long time, so I've witnessed and also have been guilty of not being able to keep count of exactly how much I've had to drink. Maybe It was just an oversight on either side? Whatever the situation don't let his review sway you because you would definitely be missing out..."}
{"text":"After having a few people swear by this place, my husband and I finally made a stop to see what all the fuss was about.  After eating at Grimaldi's, we still aren't sure what all the fuss is about.  Don't get me wrong, the pizza is good- it's just not fantastic enough for the price or stuffy atmosphere.  How can you charge $16 for a cheese pizza and then another $4 for some artichokes?  Heaven forbid you want to build yourself a multi-topping pizza.  You'll end up paying $30 when it's all said and done.  It's a thin crust, which I like, but thin enough that my husband and I could split the entire pie and leave not feeling like we just pigged out.  The cheese and sauce are good, but I can't speak for the toppings since we were playing it cheap that night and didn't order any.  I'd rather have some more authentic NY-style pizza and head over the Cosmopolitan's Secret Pizza joint.  Plus I can enjoy better music and scenery while I'm there.  By the way, why was there *one* basil leaf on our pie?  Seriously, what's up with that?"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and great service. We ordered a large 18in pizza. Half pepperoni and half basil bacon tomato and pesto. The basil half was amazing and the pepperoni half was good. It's a very thin crust, which is the style I prefer to prevent that bloated feeling.  They also have an option where you can pick up your order at the back and pay from the car. This is very handy for a family with a 2 year old!  Overall very good experience"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, laid back place. Staff is friendly. Could be cheaper, for a personal size pizza, with 4 toppings, it was $20 Cnut overall, good food and experience."}
{"text":"Walked in last night hoping to have a nice pie and great beer but they took off Four Peaks Kilt Lifter.  I quickly went elsewhere.  Why do they replace such a good selling staple?"}
{"text":"Yes, it's a chain but you know what?  So what.  It's good food.  Grimaldi's does what the best restaurants do and that is focus on doing on thing and doing it well.  Their pizzas come out of the oven fresh, delicious and unpretentious.  I don't recommend them for take out--the pizza doesn't travel well and is best eaten right away--but otherwise this is about as good as it gets for pizza in the area.  Their antipasto plate is simple and delicious.  Just fresh mozzarella, genoa salami, bread and sweet red peppers.  Perfect.   One minor low point is the drink mixes are usually pretty watered down.  Not in a way that feels like they're trying to take advantage of the customer, but it's never quite right.  Service can be very slow at times in peak hours, beyond what I think is reasonable for their staffing.  If you sit in the back you sometimes seem to get forgotten about.    Be polite with the staff of course, but sometimes you have to get their attention to get service.  It's a little negative, but not enough to wreck the experience overall."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza! Went with a big group and tried three different kinds: pepperoni/black olives on red sauce, sun-dried tomato on garlic white sauce, and bacon/onion on pesto sauce. Service was great, and everything was scrumptious!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza place in a strip mall setting. They have outdoor seating, that is not too close to road, which is nice.  I am not a big fan of US-style pizza, but this one was almost an exception. Clearly fresh and high quality ingredients makes for a great taste. I liked that they did not drown the thing in cheese and sauce too.  Ordered an appetizer platter, mozzarella was very-very good and fresh."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat New York Style pizza on the West Coast so far.  I can't compare it to Brooklyn but its still delicious.  Must be the water in New York!  Food: I stick to the standard pepperoni pizza.  The crust is nice, crisp and has a  perfect saltiness to it.  If it sits there too long, it does get soggy so try to eat it when its still hot and fresh.  They don't overdue it on the sauce and cheese so you can taste all the ingredients in each bite.   I did try the other types of meat like meatballs and sausage on the pizza.  It was quite tasty but it just wasnt the same as a plain pepperoni pizza.   Atmosphere: Nothing fancy.  Nice and clean.    Service: Never had any problems.  Everyone seemed nice and helpful"}
{"text":"Great, great pizza!  Great crust, great sauce & real slices of mozzarella. Great service too for a late lunch today."}
{"text":"Greek salad is to die for and the pizza is great of course. On the high side for cost for pizza, but still worth it"}
{"text":"Great local spot here in Gilbert, nice staff, good service, great food. Will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Slow service on a Saturday night.  Waited over an hour for our pizza.  My pizza was burnt and dry.  If you want good pizza, go to Rosati's or Chicago Brewing Co."}
{"text":"Authentic pizza lovers, this is your place. Fresh ingredients, cooked perfectly.  We started out with the antipasta. The mozzarella was fresh and the salami flavorful. Take everything in one bite and it's perfection!  We ordered our pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni, and Italian sausage.  The crust was thin and crispy but still had good texture. It wasn't too greasy and tasted awesome.   This is a great place to take a date or even just come for lunch. It has great decor with classic Italian red and white checkered table cloths. The staff is friendly and always there to take care of you.   Anybody who really enjoys pizza needs to come to this place."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of thin crust pizza. I like my food simple, fresh and tasty.  The food was good, the service was good and my water was always refilled. I don't have anything bad to say, but i didn't give it 5stars because i save that for really special places close to my heart."}
{"text":"I'm giving them two stars for the food and the food alone. We used to come to Grimaldi's all of the time because the food was great, so we decided to come in tonight. The waiter sat us down, and it seemed like he didn't really wanna be there. Two of our girlfriends showed up first and they got their drinks. Then my friend and I sat down at the table. We easily sat there for about 10 minutes and no one ever came by and asked if we wanted anything to drink. At that moment we knew whenever we saw someone just to order. Our waiter just had a very bad attitude. Like I said we love the food but our service was horrendous. Somewhat ruined our night out"}
{"text":"Never had authentic new York pizza so I can't compare but very delicious! Our server gave us some excellent suggestions and great service! Thanks Javier!"}
{"text":"Good brick oven pizza but nothing spectacular. Too expensive for what it is and they didn't have ranch dressing for your pizza which really disappointed me cause I love pizza and ranch. The service was good, they did mess up the pizza of both tables to the side of us, but they did make up for it."}
{"text":"I had a calzone which was yummy but the service ruined the experience.  Our server was friendly but inattentive and inexperienced. She rarely came to our table, we had better service from the server in the next section over. Our soda was flat and undrinkable and overall our experience was underwhelming. We probably will not return, I am disappointed as I had heard great things."}
{"text":"I should have been warned by the fact the place was more than 1/2 empty on a Saturday at noon. Service & decor are good But the pizza was not. Overcooked and brittle,served luke warm and very little cheese. Taste OK but nothing special,rather bland. Overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Love the White pizza with Garlic and Pepp. Amazing pizza. Come Herr when I can. Service is always polite and food comes in a reasonable time. Would recommend always."}
{"text":"Best pizza you will ever have!  Always tastes delicious, fresh and hot. I absolutely love Grimaldi's. :).  Had to stop by for it on this quick business trip!"}
{"text":"Wow awesome thin crust pizza! Super delicious!  Great service too"}
{"text":"This place is a must-try in Vegas!!  I visited this restaurant recently with my dad and my brother. We walked in and the atmosphere was very welcoming, and the service was absolutely fantastic. The restaurant was clean, and the design was modern and smart. It was casual, yet tasteful.   The waitress guided us through the menu. We started with a salad (I'm pretty sure it was the house salad), but it was only mediocre. The vinegarette dressing was too overpowering and it just had a salty, acidic taste to it. Then we ordered with a pizza; half sausage, half mushroom. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy, and the mozerella and other ingredients were oh so fresh.   Once we took our first bites, woah damn, there was no stopping us! Now, the three of us almost never agree on how good a food is, but we all agreed that that pizza was the best any of us had ever eaten. We're a pretty tough group to please when it comes to food, but even my dad said it was incredible delicious. And my brother, who just thinks everything is ok, love love loved it.   Would I recommend this to a friend? Child please, I would recommend this restaurant to the whole world- including my enemies."}
{"text":"I love this pizzeria. Everytime I visit Las Vegas this is a must place to eat. We always order a large with red sauce, italian sausage, mushroom, garlic, and pepperoni. The best thin crust pizza in the world! Also, the wait staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but the service was horrible. Many of us were waiters, but it took 25 minutes just to get our drink orders in ( two lemonade, blue moon, flat tire, dr. Pepper, one water). We had to go up to the hostess to move to a bigger table for a extra person after not seeing our waitress. When she did show back she saw one of on a phone and said she will come back when we were done. Instead she was busy with other tables. By the time we were ready for the check we told her we would like to split it up. She said we needed to tell her before we ordered and we would have to do the math ourselves. So after dividing up a 108.63 check she took only the cards first then came back with a check for the cash... we watched how she took time with other tables of less and more customers. Pizza was decent just service was horrible, the hostess was nice though."}
{"text":"Love the crust and sauce! Not too thin nor thick, just the right amount of crisp. My husband and I split an order of a salad and a small personal size pizza with pepperoni and sausage. Would have liked to try their pesto sauce but loved what we had ordered so much the first time that we went back twice in the 2 weeks we were there and ordered the same thing. Our favorite pizza joint when visiting LV."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with co workers, the food is really good but the service is horrible. Good took forever to come out, orders were wrong one of our part waited 30 min additional for her food. Checks were  incorrect as well."}
{"text":"Très bonne pizzas mais pas les meilleurs que j'ai mangé. Un peu cher quand meme. A quatres, trois pizzas avec un pot de sangria (28$) on en a eu pour 115$ tips compris.   Le personnel est très gentil.  Le concept, prendre une taille de pizza (ex: personnel, environ 30cm, 9$), la sauce et la mozza sont deja compris dedans. Ensuite il fait ajouter les ingrédients,  ils vont de 2$ a 4$, il y en a une quinzaine environ. Le prix de la pizza peu donc vite monter!  En bref, si vous voulez une bonne pizza dans un bon et bel endroit plutôt calme, allez-y!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Excellent service.  Pizza was served piping hot and was delicious."}
{"text":"Great pizza the service was great. You should definitely try the NY cheese cake very light and creamy ."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza ever! I also love their Mediterranean salad. Every time we come here its always amazing food!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza it's one of the best I've had in Vegas. The bartender Keith is always pleasant and does a great job getting our food and drinks to us. Enjoy their selection of beer and wine great place to go have pizza I have never been disappointed"}
{"text":"A taste of New York in the desert.  The pizza are great when they are fresh from the oven, but do not transport well so careful if you are looking for take-out."}
{"text":"Been here several times and most have been fine, however the review is now gonna be for the few times that haven't gone so well.  The orders for pizza running late or delayed thing due to cleaning the oven \"stoking the fire\" blah blah is getting old. Like many reviewers mention, why open then? Why not change your hours during this process and open when you can handle it?  Ordered salad while waiting, pizza took about an hour or more? I asked why, and was told due to \"restoking the fire\" all orders were waiting and got backed up.  Not sure why this is a constant problem and there are still no solutions? Similar fired pizza places don't shut down orders but take orders anyways and make you wait forever.  Finally got pizza, it was decent as usual. Then glasses sat with ice only for most of the pizza meal as the waitress was MIA.  Then I waited forever before I saw her again and asked for the bill, she ran over gave it to me, I then said just wait I'll give you the card to pay right now, she started taking order at table next to me during the 10 seconds I needed to give her the card. Clearly overwelmed she said \"sorry\" and ran off, then returned with receipt and sorry thanks\".  If the oven cleaning debacle everyday causes such a backup on orders and causes your service to go in the crapper for hours later then change the stupid hours or find a solution..it's getting old"}
{"text":"My Sweet Hubby's B.Day Month !!!!!..an a Free pizza ...*Thank You   Grimaldis* we have been coming here 4 years best pie in town. We just woofed down a lovely antipasto. ..lol ;))))  and in great anticipation of r pie....coming .....!! Xxoooo"}
{"text":"To start off, I love Grimaldis. The pizza is amazing; the perfect ratio of cheese to sauce and the toppings are always abundant. I especially LOVE the suction cup pepperonis. :D haha. So, I was really disappointed my last take out (which was today), I got a half pepperoni (suction cups) and cheese pizza and a chicken caesar salad. To my disappointment I did not get the $4 chicken on my salad I paid for. Don't get me wrong, I am in the service industry and get mistakes happen. And its also not a huge deal, just drove me crazy from a service standpoint. REGARDLESS, I will still be back. Just a suggestion, maybe check your to-go orders before sending them on their merry way!"}
{"text":"They were smart to put one in Vegas.  This is the ideal spot if you are looking to fuel up before the club or just to get a casual bite with your significant other.  The pizza is New York style, meaning its thin and crispy.  The sizes are hearty so a personal can feed two people and a large can feed 3-4 guys.  Their pizzas all taste really fresh and are made to order... you can even watch the chef throw the pizza dough in the air.  Their salads are also really good and their small salads are definitely shareable.  The decor is a cross between an old school italian joint and a BJs restaurant.  Both times I've been here, the service has been great.    This place has earned a spot in my Vegas restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"The bartender and the service was amazing, and the food was great too! I'm originally from New York and they really do a good job with their pizzas. The only downside is that they charge quite a bit (1-3$) for every single topping you get.. whether it's on half the pizza or the whole thing. I really like variety so getting chicken, sun dried tomatoes, peppers, and mushrooms on our pizza cost and extra 11$!! That seems just a bit ridiculous seeing as the amount if each topping they put on wasn't anything special! Some slices had no chicken, or just no peppers, very inconsistent. If you're going to charge 3$ EXTRA for chicken or tomatoes, then you should put a good amount on!"}
{"text":"After years of driving right past this place, I finally am stopping by for dinner.  For my Mom's birthday.    Unfortunately, our experience didn't start out too well.  We had called ahead for a reservation but they don't take any.  But the girl assured us that it was hardly crowded and there shouldn't be more than 15m of a wait, especially if we came by soon.  Great! We would be there in less than 30 minutes.  WHOA! did things changes in that little time.  I walked in and found out that not only was it PACKED,  there was a 40 minute wait.  And that really soured me on the experience, because I felt a little duped.  But I guess it is possible that a mass of people showed up in 20 minutes.  It happens......(not really).  But otherwise, the meal was pretty good!  The pizza is super good, with a wonderful thin crispy crust.  I can't believe I had never been to this place before.  I will need to come back for sure!  And apparently, they don't offer anything fun for your birthday.  We mentioned that it was my Mom's birthday, in passing, and the waiter shrugged it off.  He did give us a card that she could fill out for her next birthday to get a free pizza. Who remembers the coupon 1 year later?  Pretty lame."}
{"text":"New York PIzza style in Las Vegas.  There are five locations in the Vegas area and we went to this one.  Ordered a medium with mushroom and sausage.  The crust was good.  Isn't it all about the crust anyway?  Nice flavor and texture.  Sauce was very neutral.  No real acid, sweetness, or herbaciousness.   That's either good or bad meaning they probably do not add much to the sauce and just let is speak for itself.  Topping were sparse and slices of mozzarella was used so it was not as evenly distributed as if it were shredded, of course the cheese they use is probably so soft you couldn't shred it.  Grimaldi's Pizza is a lot better than the major pizza chains.  When you start comparing it to single shops or local favorites it all comes down to personal taste.   Grimaldi's appears to be expanding nationally, hopefully not at the expense of taste and quality."}
{"text":"From the classic New York pizzeria style atmosphere to the fantastic service, Grimaldi's never fails to impress. This is my third time here and it has been great every time. The food quality is top notch and the toppings taste fresh. I think it's safe to say it's one of the closest things you'll find in Vegas to New York style brick oven pies. My only minor complaint is no booth seating. Get the white pizza. It rocked my world."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I can firmly say it ain't the original Grimaldi's. It is definitely a great location for those staying in the Venetian or the Palazzo, but the place lacks character and is uninspired.   The pizza is just fine, especially if you're having a craving for it. However, it could and should be better than it is."}
{"text":"Decent Pizza Pie.  Very Tasty Meatballs.  OK Service.  Easy access from the Pallazzo Spa +"}
{"text":"Ate there a few nights ago. Both my wife and I got food poisoning!! \"Cooks\" do not wear gloves - didn't notice this until we were leaving. I don't think anything else needs to be said."}
{"text":"Typical great Grimaldi's pizza. We had large pepperoni and large cheese for 5 kids and 2 adults. Service was lacking and unattentive. Sprites brought to the table were soda water since the tanks needed to be changed. We were in a rush and requested everything be brought out as soon as they could.  Our server was barely able to be found and anything we needed we ended up having to flag down or get up and find someone else to assist us.   Pepperoni came right out, cheese for some reason came out 15 minutes later. Still like Grimaldi's,  but this experience was lacking to say the least..."}
{"text":"Bad service, Bad management...very \"wham, bam thank you ma'am\" attitude...we were embarrassed we recommended the place...wouldn't go back...!   We sent an email to someone from their site...they emailed me back that they would \"look into\" my bad experience...never heard another word.  They will sooooo not get my money again!  The pizza is good...but that is not the only reason to frequent a business!  You have to know that when you support a business, in turn, you expect to have decent service and when there isn't...a decent explanation or resolution offered...!  Got none of that here...they're taking the money and could careless how the experience goes...it didnt bother their Regional Operations Manager one bit that I was unhappy with my visit!!  Thank God for the Restaurant 25 Degrees...at least I had a 1/2 burger left over to eat that night!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  I had it twice in two weeks in fact  :)  Friendly staff, quick food and the pizza was very delicious.    My second pizza was a Pepperoni and Ricotta and  the Ricotta was put on a little thick for my taste, but overall was still very, very good. I also ask for it to be a little crispy as well, which I liked more."}
{"text":"This pizza is sooo good!! Went for the first time yesterday and I want more today lol.  The menu was pretty basic offering pretty much pizza and salads mostly and they charge for toppings but other than that it was probably one of the best pizzas I had. Gotta try it with spicy chicken sausage it was awesome"}
{"text":"Orgasmatronic.   Can hardly wait til next month when I'll be feasting on another one.  Just....delicious.  Any naysayers are just that.  Food poisoning claimers are full o shite."}
{"text":"Um, yeah...this place is just gross. Cheap-o decor & tables and chairs like what you'd find at the erstwhile Pizzeria Uno's chain (think dusty fake plants, balsa wood unstable chairs that can barely hold a high school student, etc). Greasy/not good/not fresh Pizza Hut-ish pizza. Salads straight out of the bag-style: iceberg lettuce and bagged shaved carrots/purple cabbage, Wishbone from-the-bottle dressing. (Making fresh salad dressing is incredibly cheap and easy, but alas GRIMY-ALDI's, your cooks can't even do that.)  If you want ANYTHING healthy or clean on the lunch menu, forget it...doesn't exist.   Parking a challenge because this slop shop is in the uber-popular Kierland area. Finding it a challenge, since signage and location are hidden.   Service on the meh side: Not bad. Not good.  To re-cap: sh*tty food, bad location, bad parking and 50/50 service. AND it's pretty expensive, for what you get.  NO!"}
{"text":"I was spending a lovely weekend in Vegas with some friends. After a night of moderate drinking we woke up to a feeling of utter agony. Our drunken state had turned into a hangover of the melancholy variety. Not even the freshest melons of Las Vegas could tame this horrid feeling. But wait, perhaps a small glimmer of hope. In the early 15th century, The Italians, with their delightful ingenuity, discovered a cure for this absolute evil of feelings brought on by the mishaps of the previous evening. Pizza. Let me say that word again as the words tend to drop from my lips like a melted cheese slowly slides off the beautiful dough disc from whence it started. PIZZA.   We all decided to give Grimaldis pizza a chance to wow us. It is located inside the palazzo hotel and casino. If you find yourself having trouble finding the place, you could always ask any one of the friendly people sauntering around the casino pretending to look busy. Be warned, however, as the directions given will not put you at your destination due to the fact that these fine folks here at the palazzo haven't a clue as to where anything is, or even their current surroundings in general.   After traversing the second level, making our way through the parodies and disparaging mockery of the Italian culture, we finally made our way to the darkest corner where the pizza parlor resides. We approach the portly white gentleman behind the podium, and after a long awkward stare he asks how many of us there are. The four of us look at each other for a moment and respond with a stern \"four.\" After we established the amount of people that were standing in front of the dull young fellow, he then proceeded to inform us of news that we still to this day have never quite recovered from. Apparently, 4:00 pm pacific time is when this pizzeria begins their cleaning regimen. We were told that their ovens, of which the pizzas are prepared in, were being cleaned and would not be available for over an hour. This was the initial downfall of this establishment and, in my heated state of emotion, I was prepared to give a one star review for this folly. However, I remained diplomatic and decided to wait until I got the full experience.   We returned approximately 47 minutes later and much to my surprise, there was a new host. He sat us and told us he didn't know who our server would be, but someone would serve us. At this point an overwhelming wave of concern came over me. If the first two employees were showing this kind of incompetence, what could we expect with our server. Here is where things started to finally turn around...  Our affable waiter approached the table with an absolute jovial disposition. His friendly mannerisms were out shined only by his knowledge of the handful of items listed on the barren menu. The appetizers consisted of a variety of unsatisfying salads. We decided not to waste our time with such trivial cuisine and went straight to ordering our grease pies. Three of the four party members order 12\" personal pizzas. The fourth decided to go with a calzone. Each topping cost hundreds of pennies, however due to the fact we were currently residing in Vegas, we decided to splurge. I requested a pizza consisting or pepperoni and standard breakfast bacon. Food was exceptional. Taste buds were tickled to a heavenly state. After receiving our food, we did not see our waiter again.   As for some things I may have left out, I'd like to rate separately as follows:  Service: Mediocre at best, not much to see here in terms of quality. One friendly face and kooky demeanor out of a staff of twenty sub par employees was not a saving grace.   Decor & Ambiance: A tad blasé for my tastes. Atmosphere left a lot to be desired.   Food quality & Taste: May have been the saving grace, at the very least preventing me from giving a less than reputable one star rating.   Overall experience: I'd prefer to rate a 2 1/2 stars for my overall experience, however it's an impossibility so I landed on a 3 star rating. Would only recommend if an absolute last resort or if a deranged captor is holding you at gunpoint and demands you feed him a lackluster slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of New York style thin crust pizza, so Grimaldi's is right up my alley. This was my second visit and it was every bit as good as the first. We started with a small caesar salad ($7), which was big enough to feed two and quite good. For pizza in a new venue I normally go with the tried and true sausage & pepperoni before experimenting with fancier toppings. A large italian sausage, pepperoni, and roasted red pepper pizza ($24) was served piping hot with just the right amount of crispiness. Delicious and filling. Our server was polite and personable, even recommending other restaurants to try since I'm new in town!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times now and the pizza is great. The issue this time was service. We sat at the bar to watch game 7 and the service was slow. The bartender (David) was nice but not attentive and clean up was lacking."}
{"text":"Sono stato in questo locale attratto dalle buone recensioni all'interno del palazzo, devo dire la pizza è buona ovviamente per l'america ma nulla a che vedere con la pizza napoletana è più una focaccia, tutto sommato si può mangiare buone anche le insalate, noi stanchi di mangiare hamburger e patatine fritte abbiamo provato e siamo rimasti comunque soddisfatti.  Un plauso va sicuramente al manager italiano Massimo che ti fa sentire respirare aria di casa, lo consiglio sicuramente per variare la vostra alimentazione una giornata va bene è da provare.  Lo consiglio!"}
{"text":"Im coming from Texas and this place really caught my attention. Great pizza at a not so expensive price.  Great ingredients great staff - what more could you ask for.  My hunt for great pizza still continues but this joint definitely left an impression."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and salad. Hot tip from an Aussie- a small pizza (12inch) and a small salad will feed 2! Would recommend the Mediterranean salad"}
{"text":"Love Grimaldi's! Always great service and excellent food! Shared The Don, best meatballs!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is delicious and sufficiently crispy crust. Better than dominos and other pizza joints. Awesome Place"}
{"text":"If you're looking for great, fresh, thin crust pizza look no further. We went here based on other reviews and we're really glad we did. We shared a small house salad which was a nice portion for two at $6 plus we added Genoa salami for $2 more. It was as fresh as it could be. We followed that with a meatball and jalapeno medium pizza which was a great size for two. Topping prices were very reasonable..just $2 each. And the mozzarella was fresh instead of the shredded kind. The service was great and fast.We were pleasantly surprised at how affordable this was for a great quality meal in the Palazzo shops. Maybe that's why it wasn't crowded at all. It's kind of tucked away yet really close to the Grand Canal shops in the Venetian. I will definitely try the one in Florida next time we're there."}
{"text":"my first trip here, on a thursday night. a little crowded but not too bad. we were sat right away, and immediately had someone ask what we would like to drink.   we ordered a small pizza (which was actually pretty big) and just water. waited....and waited....finally wondering where our food was. all of a sudden the manager comes out and introduces herself. explains to us \"i didnt like the way your pizza was coming out, so i had them re-do it...sorry about the wait\" apparently our pizza was cooking uneven and would have come out either mushy, or overdone. when our pizza finally did come out it was great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by Grimaldi's at the end of a long workday that left both of us unwilling to cook dinner.  I had eaten at a location in Chandler before but that was for a rehearsal dinner so I'm not sure if I had a typical Grimaldi's experience.    We entered the restaurant and were immediately greeted and seated at a two top by the window.  The menu is printed on the placemat and there are plates already placed before you are seated.  I don't mind the placemat menus so much but then why the plates?  You just have to move them to read the menu and on a two top there isn't a ton of room to begin with.  Additionally, there are a LOT of tables packed into that dining room, but that really didn't bother us until we got up to leave.  Walking out was like traveling through an obstacle course.    After we sat, we checked out the menu and the waiter came to take our drink order.  He came back with our drinks quickly and explained the three different pizza options available.  I ordered the white with sausage and my boyfriend had the classic with pepperoni.  Once our pizzas arrived (we didn't wait long), we again had to deal with table space issues.  We each ordered a personal size pie, I think it was 12\".  Our plates were stacked in the middle of the table so we could read the menu, so the server placed our pies in front of us.  At this point the plates were just table decoration.  There is no way we could have used them and put our pizzas to the side.  Not really a major issue but not as smooth as it could have been.    Once we got settled in with the table, we dove in to the pizzas.  I immediately noticed that the crust towards the center of my pizza was very soft and not crispy at all.  I'm not sure if that was a cooking time issue or a sauce/olive oil issue.  The pizza was still quite tasty, but would have been even more enjoyable with a crispier crust.  Cheese and meat quality were great and I really liked the smoky flavor that the coal oven gives the pizza.  I would characterize it as good but not great pizza.  My boyfriend's pizza was closer to great.  From the crust to the sauce to the pepperoni, this pie was spot on.  Everything was very flavorful, especially the sauce. The cheese wasn't too heavy and the boyfriend thinks it may have been fresh mozz.  His pizza was definitely the better of the two.    The waiter came back during our meal to ask about drink refills and was prompt with the bill as we finished.  We took home two slices of white and I'll be glad to have it for lunch tomorrow!  The environment at Grimaldi's is definitely family friendly and good for groups, so I wouldn't suggest it if you are looking for something intimate or quiet.  A beer, soda, two pizzas and tip totaled 39 bucks.  We felt that was a decent price for dinner.  We enjoyed Grimaldi's and would recommend it to friends!"}
{"text":"Loved Grimaldi's!  Pizza was great, service was excellent, and the cheesecake was out of this world.  We were impressed with the expeditor.  Nothing left the kitchen unless it passed his inspection and met his high quality demands.  Made us happy knowing they cared so highly about their food.  Now for the cheesecake.  They make it in-house and it was the best cheesecake I have ever had.  The crust alone was perfection.  It melted in my mouth.  I could have eaten just the crust it was so good.  I ordered the blue berry cobbler cheesecake.   Whole berries were at the bottom of the cheesecake.   The consistency of the cheesecake was perfection.  The soft granola sprinkled on top for the \"cobbler\" feel was just the right crunch to balance this piece of heaven.  I don't know who their chef was but kudos!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  I took my BF and his daughter to dinner and at first the service was great but once my food showed up our server was MIA."}
{"text":"We LOVED Grimaldi's until we went last night... They had dropped our pizza on the floor and had to make it for us again.. No big deal, except that while they were making us a new pizza they were using a high pressure hose and spraying it straight down on the floor making a huge range of water back spray, hitting our new pizza and the open line where all the toppings are kept. Gross, I wont pay for floor water pizza. We had to leave. So disappointed and the worst part was the manager didn't even care."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the best pizzas I have ever had. We started off with the Antipasto for appetizer, fresh sliced bread with salami, olives, roasted bell peppers and fresh mozzarella. We then had the large pesto pizza with ricotta, tomatoes and sausage. Amazing meal and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Good pizza and the garlic rolls were tasty.  We had good service, the pizza came out fast due to the high temperature 1000 degree oven.  Will visit again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"First of all, I think the name on the listing should just be Grimaldi's - I had a hard time finding these reveiws.  But anyway...  This is our new favorite pizza place in Las Vegas/Henderson.  The antipasto salad is also good.  My DH and DS refuse to get pizza anywhere else.  I hesitate to give it a good rating because I like the fact that we have never waited in line to get in.    My only beefs are that I don't like the process of picking up the take-out items from the bartender and also the parking is a little limited when its busy."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good pizza place on Saturday night, with the help of Yelp we landed at Grimaldi's. We walked in and I was immediately a happy girl. I mean who plays jazz anymore,  especially not the sweet voice of Madelaine Peyroux. But I digress, we were greated by a smiling young man who sat us and gave us the run down. He returned my playful banter and left us in the hands of our server, Cristiana. Another pleasant human, she suggested a wine and took our order.  The antipasto we shared was delicious, we finished 1 more sip of wine (a phenomenal pairing with the food) and the sweet server brought out our pizza, also crazy good!  I believe in giving kudos and thanks when I receive fantastic  service/food/experience  so I asked to speak to the manager. Vince came out and introduced himself. We spoke of the great food,  impeccable service and the all around wonderful experience we had on a low key Saturday night. Hats off to Grimaldi's, if you're lookin for good food,  nice casual but classy atmosphere with outstanding service, Grimaldi's is your place!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Soggy crust. The caprese salad was just awful. Rubbery mozzarella, cold tasteless tomatoes, the basil was oversized like a giant leaf with no taste as well. I will not go back to this place"}
{"text":"I've always seen this place incredibly crowded and the girlfriend raved about how great it is. Finally we took a Friday night after work to go. I was amazed as we got right in. We each ordered a salad which were fresh and good but the real main attraction was the pizza. You could watch and smell them being made which is great. We ended up with a pepperoni and mushroom. It came out excellent. A little car from the charcoal oven and a wonderful smokey flavor. It was really a great pie to eat warm. Near the end of the meal I was surprised by a manager (or possibly the owner?) coming over and asking how our meal was and really conversing with us. I said how great it was and how my girl raved about it to bring me here the first time - he said thats great and offered a free slice of cheesecake to each of us on the house! A really great guy and a really great atmosphere made for a really great meal. Only slight on it was there was some pizza left over and I took it home and frankly their pizza is nowhere near as good the next day. Straight from the oven crisp and warm is the way coal brick oven pizza needs to be and so be prepared to eat it all while there!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Traveled from far away to try and are now regulars...worth the drive from nywhere."}
{"text":"Well as a self proclaimed pizza aficionado, this was a very different than usual pizza, but was very good, they use a coal fire oven, to make a very thin crusted, pizza with fresh mozzarella on top giving it that rustic look, the taste was not jaw dropping, but there is something about it that i did really like a lot, and have eaten there a few times now. and will be back.."}
{"text":"Nicest pizza place I've ever been too. New York style! They filter the water to mimic New York to get authentic taste. Service was also great! Vegan friend loved it too!"}
{"text":"Andrew our server was great! The pizza not so great. The sauce, like other reviewers have commented, lacked any flavor other than tomato. The crust was okay and the antipasti plate needed a bit more bread to enjoy the different flavors.  Sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"If it were only a review of Dan, the server who waited on me, and the other staff who helped me, the place would get 4.5 stars, or even a perfect 5. The food is what brought my experience down.   The place is clean, things were pleasant. Food presentation was fast and nice. The caprese was served with just underripe beefsteak tomato. The balsamic was ordinary, at best.   The biggest disappointment was the pizza. It's rated one of the best in Vegas, and I'd like to meet the people who voted on this and ask them what in the world they were thinking. It's far, FAR from some of the best I've had in life.   Don't get me wrong, the pie was ok. Barely. The old adage rings true: if it's good, it's great... But I'd say the pie was just south of mediocre. The crust was the best part and it needed another dollop of sauce. The biggest travesty is they charge a fixed price for toppings regardless of the size of the pie. So, I got a personal pie (12\") and paid the same price for my ham and mushrooms that a large pie (18\") pays. Sorry, but that's just not right.   To Dan's credit, he just listened to my bitching and didn't take one side or other. Next time I'm in Vegas and looking for a pizza on the way out of town I'm headed to Metro Pizza like I should've done tonight."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. After reading yelp reviews we ended up trying the meatballs on one of the pizzas - AMAZING! Thin crust, fresh ingredients, absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Nice place all staff very friendly,We wait a little but I like the ambience here, and the pizza are really good we'll be back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza we've ever had!  We got the large pizza with pepperoni, feta cheese, and green olives on half (the green olives weren't listed on the menu, so just ask for them).  The pizza had the perfect amount of thin crust crisp with just enough creaminess of the cheese...truly amazing!  We sat at one of the high-top tables in the front of the restaurant, which gives a little more room in between tables verses the tables towards the back."}
{"text":"I've gone to the San Tan location more times than I can count and I've always had an enjoyable experience. Food has always been great and the service has been phenomenal. But tonight, my parents took me to the Old Town location for my birthday. It was early so there were a lot of open tables. We had been seated for about 5 minutes before our server came over and gave us all waters, we gave him our drink and dinner order; 2 iced teas, 2 pizzas and a salad. He comes back a little later with the salad, but no tea. I had to ask again. Then another server brings out our first pizza and serves the first slices. Our server brings the second pizza, doesn't offer to serve a slice and apparently didn't notice our drinks needed refills. We ate, talked and began to notice our server was nowhere to be found. At this point my mom had asked 2 other servers for a water refill and was ignored by both, my frustration took the best of me, I loudly stopped a server that was walking by and asked where our server was and that we needed refills. She does nothing. She stands there, tells a different server and then that last server refills our drinks. I asked for a box and the check because I just wanted to get out of there. Our server makes his return to take the bill and process the card, good job bro.  If I want Grimaldis again I'll make the drive to the San Tan location where they don't disappear and don't ignore paying customers."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say? By far the best pizza place in Las Vegas, They say one of the things that make their pizza sooooo good is the water..hmmmmm well keep using that water!!! The place is nice and relaxing alittle loud but lighting is nice and the prices are about right for what you are eating!! Eat pizza hut after you eat here and you'll think you're eating Crap!!"}
{"text":"The BEST of the best!!!! I liked thicker crust pizza until I found Grimaldi's!! Fresh ingredients and great service!!"}
{"text":"Ive been here three times and every time my wife says its the best pizza shes ever had! It really is the best pizza in town. They also have a lot of good beers on draft to go with their great pizza. We normaly get a plain peperoni(because its still a classic, and their peperonis are delicious! ) and one with garlic, extra basil and tomatoes.  Service is always super friendly and attentive. It can sometimes take a while to get your food, but you wont mind because the atmosphere is great, no blaring music, no bright lights in your face.... great for a conversation... its costs around 60-70 ( 70-80 w tip) for my wife and I to eat and drink here. Best pizza in town, great selection of beer and wine, awesome servers and a great atmosphere make us regulars at this place. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Came in for my 2nd visit since I wanted to use my birthday coupon. I love their pizza. I don't think it gets any better than Grimaldi's! From their hostess, to the servers, everyone is so friendly and the food is great. I would recommend the Spicy Chicken Sausage as a stand alone topping unless you wanna add veggies then I suppose you should ;) The hostess even brought a few pieces of dough for my little ones to play with while we waited for our order. How cool is that? Will be coming back as long as the pizza stays delish!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious pizza every time with a class or bottle of lambrusco! Ohhh I can't forget the amazing oreo cheese cake mmm!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard good things so we decided to try it out. We were seating immediately but it took 15 minutes before someone took our order and then an hour until we got our medium pepperoni pizza. The salads were- eh. I would choose a QT salad over Grimaldi's any day. Oh yeah,  when we finally got our pizza-it was BURNT on the bottom. For all the money this place charges. So not worth it. Should have went to Pizza Hut. :/"}
{"text":"THE WOREST PIZZA EVER! It was my first time there and I wasn't sure what to expect. We ordered 2 individual pizzas but the pizzas were flavorless. They were very hard and cold. The cheese wasn't fully melted. We complained to our waitress but nothing was done! All she did was bring out our the bill."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and friendly staff. If you're looking for a pizza dinner at a laid back sit down establishment, this is the one."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas. Heck it's my favorite pizza place in the entire southwest. The pizza is delicious. The pepperoni is the best that I have ever had. The cheese is fresh and yummy. The service is always friendly and quick. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but then you are getting some excellent pizza!"}
{"text":"It's the best pizza I've had in Las Vegas. But your gonna pay for it."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance that is a part of most Grimaldi's restaurants.  It definately has an east coast feel, Chicago/NY, I especially like the I 10 and ray location for that reason. The service is good for both the i10 and Santan locations. I am a big fan of  the garlic white pizza, it has literally become my all time favorite pizza and prior to eating it, I would have never thought garlic and pizza would be good.t never disappoints.  I do wish they would make a gluten free pizza and for those who are unfamiliar this is pretty much a pizza and salad place."}
{"text":"Fabulous pizza!  Generally I am a carb kinda gal... so naturally, a satisfying thin crust pizza is hard for me to find.  Grimaldi's hits the nail right on the head.  The great taste of the tomatoes and herbs on each pizza is so perfect that I forget about the thin crust :)  Well done."}
{"text":"Even a plain cheese calzone was amazing. Very nice servers. Even nicer cannolis. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ate here was not impressed with the service or food. Pizza was mediocre and while we were dining a server came and removed our table condiments such as red pepper, parmesean, salt, & pepper. Although they weren't busy we still had an hour before close and I thought that was very rude (I actually use red peppers) won't be back here and for the price and atmosphere I have higher expectations"}
{"text":"Favorite Pizzeria, we love the table by the lights waterfall, awesome service, free birthday pizza, kids can play with the dough at the table. Can't beat it."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever! My 2nd time eating at Grimaldi's . We ordered a large pizza with Italian sausage and mushroom . The pizza was thin crust and the sausage was really good. I also tried the cesar salad which was amazing! Oh please try the cheese cake, it was worth it. The service was great!! The waiter was very attentive."}
{"text":"i had seen grimaldis on food network when i was living in Socal so when i learned they had locations in las vegas i was move than eager to give it a shot.. HONESTLY the BEST pizza i have ever had.  the thing crust and quality ingredients make all the difference.. this is a place i hit once a week and not only because the food but the service is amazing.. love GRIMALDIS"}
{"text":"OK pizza.  I had pepperoni and roasted red peppers on a 12 inch pizza.  Not overly heavy with toppings and it tasted good, but $3.00 per topping is a bit much.  Caprese salad was good.  Very annoying that smokers are on the other side of the bar outside and their cigarette smoke is funneling into the dining area.  The bar keep sent them packing though, so thank you!"}
{"text":"After a day of shopping this is a great restaurant you can sit down and enjoy a pizza and salad.   Staff is always friendly and outgoing. Always a nice treat after a day in the mall to catch up with friends. Try and call to set a reservation ahead of time just in case since the Fashion Show Mall is usually busy."}
{"text":"Grimaldis Pizza is coal-oven baked with a thin crust and is consistently excellent! We go there numerous times a month for their pizza and excellent house (full of quality veggies like oven-roasted red peppers) and Mediterranean salads. The quality of their meats is SO much better than most pizza joints. We also love their atmosphere with red checkered table clothes, a huge bar to sit at and a nicely lit and quiet side patio. Numerous beers on tap including the Italian beer Peroni, which is light and flavorful and our favorite.  I am knocking off one star for several reasons.... first the music, it is a bit jazzy and rat-pack like and absolutely gets on your nerves, especially if you are a repeat client which we are. We have probably been to Grimaldis at least 100 times, in Gilbert, Scottsdale and Chandler Arizona. Recently we went to the Las Vegas location and laughed when we went in and sure enough, the same annoying playlist. The other reason I am knocking off one star is that we wish there was another option other than pizza. Even one signature pasta dish, or a calamari or something other than pizza and salad. They do have a meatball appetizer which is great for the Atkins type like my husband, but we wish there was a slight menu expansion. And finally, my beloved pineapple. The pizza is amazing but adding pineapple as a topping option would make us and no doubt many other diners very happy to see.   Grimaldis Scottsdale is overall outstanding and consistent so highly recommend it. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza...perfectly cooked crisp thin crust.  The Mediterranean salad is very good as well.  Good service.  Nice atmosphere.  A consistent favorite."}
{"text":"Horrible! my husband and I decided to eat here since I am from NY and he is from MD, we both love NY style pizza.........which this is not! it looked good when it came to the table but as soon as I took a bite I was very dissapointed, we got 2 small pizzas first was a pizza with red sauce cheese and shrooms and the second was a white margherita pizza, the red sauce has absolutely no flavor to it, I mean NO flavor it tasted like water seriously! the white pizza was the better place of the two but still wasnt worth what we paid. its expensive for what it is and the topping are priced way to high between 2-4 dollars per topping. the only thing I can say good about this place is that the cheesecake is made fresh in house and is very good, I got a strawberry cheesecake and hubby got the oreo which he and  I both loved,the strawberry actually has strawberries in the mix its not on top like most others. I would never go back for the pizza but if I was in the area and wanted cheesecake I would stop in and get it to go. Oh and when hubby and I walked into this place there was about 5 servers or whoever just standing there in a group talking,but when we walked in they just stared at us as we walked to our table,didnt say anything just stared it was really awkward!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the closest pizza you will get in Arizona to New York. I had a pepperoni and mushroom pizza love the fact that the sauce is put on top of the toppings it's is very unique only pizzeria I've been to that does that. The salad was crisp and fresh. Our server was very friendly. I will for sure return again."}
{"text":"The pizza here is SO good! Love the atmosphere and decor. Our waiter was a very kind man with glasses and an accent and was very courteous and authentic. He made us feel comfortable about staying to finish our meal though it was past closing time and they were cleaning up which I appreciated. We will definitely come back once in the area :)"}
{"text":"Super gross... it's hard for me to find a bad pizza. Welp I found it. Not only was it cold when I received my pizza, but it was tasteless. The cheese is slices of mozzarella with these weird tiny fake tasting pepperonis. Sauce.... no flavor. By the way, this pizza was free. And still even then, worst free pizza I ever tasted. Usually anything free tastes great. Moving on to the salad. $9 Mediterranean salad, tastes like grass. So bottom line. Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"3 stars: A-OK.  It's thin crust pizza from a chain restaurant.   Claim to fame is the coal burning oven.  This particular location is in the mall.   If you've ever lived in NYC, you'll wonder what the fuss is about.   If you've ever lived in Chicago, you'll complain that the pizza is paper thin.   They have pizza and beer, how can you go wrong - so long as the pizza is hot and the beer is cold, it's just fine.  They have TVs inside, they email coupons for your birthday if you sign up on the website, they aim to please.   You can't really go wrong.  If you think you're going to have life changing pizza inside fashion show mall, there's something wrong with you."}
{"text":"Ambience perfect . Awesome service . Wine excellent . Kale Salad incredible .  The pizza ...  Nopes . Failed . Im from New England and this is not a NY pizza . If Grimaldi rethinks thier typical pie they can turn this place into something unbeatable ."}
{"text":"A great lunch spot - outstanding Margherita thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients and bottomless unsweetened ice tea."}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. Chocolate cheesecake and latte was a great way to end the meal. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience with taking out one time a few months ago that made me hesitant to try it again... but after last nights Dominos could not satisfy my pizza craving, my boyfriend and I decided to give it another try this afternoon and WOW! We were sold! The Medi salad was very good & a small is just the right size for 2. Then we ordered a small to share and perfect, 3 slices each. Tasted crispy and fresh. To finish off we had a NY Style Cheesecake that was delicious! We gave 4 stars just because no pizza beats NY pizza, but other than that.. SO GOOD."}
{"text":"The place reeked of Portabello mushrooms when you walk in, which was off-putting. The place wasn't packed, but did have some tables. We had terrible service. We waited forever for our waiter to come back to take our order, our water glasses were empty more often than full, and the food took too long. We had ordered a beer with the pizza and we each ate two pieces before we told another staff member to cancel the beer. We waited again to get our check and for them to pick it up. The food wasn't anything special. Then the manager came over as we were getting our check to ask how everything was right next to the waiter. He was walking away as he asked the question so clearly he didn't care.  I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. Good service, food food, with the flavor that you can only get from Grimaldi's. Parking wasn't the easiest, but where in downtown Scottsdale is it? Worth a look, if you're looking for a good pie."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday night around 7:30 and there was a bit of a crowd. The building itself speaks to you, with it's brick facade with windows big enough to see what all the buzz is about inside.   We were seated promptly and all the waitresses were very attentive. They explained to us the concept of their restaurant and bit of background, which was quick and nice. We got a front row seat to the action, watching the team put together the pizzas with perfect precision.   We ordered a \"personal\" which is a 12'' pizza; that is way too big to be personal! And the toppings!!! Loaded on, not like your mainstream chain pizza place. You will definitely get your moneys worth here at Grimaldi's. The thin crust was perfect for me since I don't like thick crust pizzas.   My friend had the oreo cheesecake, which we found out was handmade daily in store by one of the very talented waitresses.   All in all, the portions are big, the staff is friendly and I can't wait to go back when I get back to Arizona."}
{"text":"Grimaldis has some damn good pizza. Every time I come I HAVE to try some new toppings. Also, their deserts and salads.. AMAZING. Although the prices are a bit stiff (per topping/pizza) I would rather pay a bit more for better quality. I would highly recommend this place to anyone I know for some good pizza. The cooks make the pizza/toss/top and everything right in front. Everything made fresh daily and a good selection of beverages at the bar! Sometimes you can hear the fellas speaking spanish and if you catch what they are saying it will make you laugh you butt off! Keep the fresh pizzas comin!"}
{"text":"Bomb. Amazing service and food is great from salad all the way to the dessert."}
{"text":"Pepperoni was spot on.  Cheese and crust are both very New York Style.  Best pizza I've had in Phoenix.  Love me some Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love the pizza here. We usually get a Margherita style pizza. Food is always great but service needs a little work (mainly the bartender). The host/hostess and servers are always welcoming whenever we go here. This visit however, we had the bartender serve us and we felt uncomfortable and more of an inconvenience to him. He never checked back on us to ask how was everything and was just rude. Next time we will probably just order our food to go."}
{"text":"Ask to be seated in Ethan's section. He made the visit and the food brought us back. Will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, amazing Caesar salad, do not order their anti-pasta it's super small and not really a salad. The service is amazing."}
{"text":"First trip to Grimaldi's was a winner.  They basically won the super bowl, if you will.  We have been FIGHTING this no-carb thing, and tonight we really caved.  I bought a 4-pack of beer, pledging to return to it once I satisfied my blood-type-thirst for pizza.  We ended up in Old Town and Cassie recommended Grimaldi's based on a whim.  Quickly seated and greeted, and although our table was at a busy corner, we had a great perspective of the entire place, most importantly the brick-oven.  Our caesar salad came quickly and was better than average.  Shortly after, our \"small\" Italian sausage and mushroom pizza arrived, and fully satiated our ravenous appetites.  Fresh mozzarella, flavorful sausage, and delicious sauce, all combined with perfectly crispy crust... Mmmmm.  Pizza.  Will (we'll) be back."}
{"text":"Our second time here was just as great as the first. Made me wonder why I only gave it three stars last time. It deserves five stars for sure! Great food, fast service, great service/wait staff. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Nice place.  Friendly and helpful staff.  And the pizza...well, it was excellent.  We had soft drink and beer, Caesar salad and pizza.  Was the best meal we had in Vegas (and, at the same time, one of the cheapest)"}
{"text":"I have been to a few other Grimaldi locations and this one is by far the best! The food is always delicious. Tonight, my salad didn't come out before the pizza and our waiter realized it had not come out, immediately the general manager (who is top notch) came over and apologized and made it right. The customer service here and DELICIOUS pizza is what keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is my alternative choice for pizza if we did not make it to LGO. I have been to this location a few times in the past year, the pizza has been consistently delicious, thin pizzas with the only things you wanted. I like their concept of 'build your own pizza from size, cheese and toppings\". I always have my pizza with Italian sausages, mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes. Hmmm....  Service was great, and their waiting timer is a cute slice of pizza. I'd give 5 stars if their seating can be rearranged, I think it's a bit too crowded right now..."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Scottsdale! So good! Get it, eat it, love it. The restaurant is awesome but you can order anything to go as well. Do it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Now I am not one to usually frequent chain restaurants while on vacation, but the location and review for this restaurant compelled me to make an exception. And boy, was I glad that I did.  Their thin crust pizzas are nice and crispy. The toppings are tasty and varied. The sauce is pleasant and slightly sweet. What was not to like?  If you are visiting Vegas from a region that does not have a Grimald's, you would do well to fill your pizza craving here."}

PS It was so good, that we ate it as our last lunch in Vegas at the end of our vacation having eaten at the Eastern Ave. location at the beginning of our vacation."}
{"text":"I tried my first pizza at Grimaldi's last week.  Not only was the pizza great, the server and staff were very accommodating. I would go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I love that you can get basil on the pizza after it comes out - so good! I find myself coming here pretty regularly because it's delicious and you can get wine by the half carafe - perfect when you want more than a glass, but not the whole bottle. This place gets packed in the evenings, but worth the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best Pep and Mushroom pizza in the Valley"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews.  But this deserves mention.  I expect a renowned and highly regarded place such as Grimaldi's to be superb in all respects, especially being located in a place such as The Palazzo.  Our large thin New York style meatball, mushroom and fresh garlic pizza took around 40-45 mins to come out after we had to ask the waitress when we could expect it.  By the time it got to us it wasn't hot.  Barely lukewarm.  When I started on my second slice it was all cold (4-5 mins later).  A Chicago style deep dish pizza doesn't even take this long to make.    We asked for a side of marinara and it's been almost 10 mins and still nothing.  So we gave up and just asked for the check.  As a side note they were NOT busy.  Barely a handful of costumers.  I would not recommend coming here.  There's lot of better restaurants in this hotel and this city that serve HOT and good food without making you wait.  You don't get a second chance to make a good first impression."}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase.  This is my favorite pizza in AZ.  You can't beat the pizza and the location right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love this place..  Their Pizza n salad are delicious.  Every time I go here, never disappointed.  The Service & food is amazing. In all the times I've been here, I've always had great service. Unfortunately, yesterday(6-28-14),  my server was not up to par. Remind you, it was not busy. She did not pre-bus, it took a while before We got what we requested for, rarely checked on us, had some attitude, and condescending. I definitely will make sure I don't have her on my next visit.  If it will help management, she was the server to a party of 9 ppl and a baby, having a baby shower lunch.  However on a previous visit, our server Tommy, well yesterday, he came and visited our table and greeted us with a warm hello.  This was just a nice gesture that our server remembered us.   :)  Keep up the great work Grimaldi's!!!"}
{"text":"Salads are tasty and fresh! Pizza is beyond delicious and the service is great! Every server I've had took good care of us. Never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Visiting Mom in Scottsdale, I was looking for a good slice of pizza.  Almost all of the places here are upscale, located in a very monied area; lots of vacationers, retirees, and seasonal residents, most of them well-to-do.  The pizza is quite good; nice char on the thin, hand tossed crust, hearty sauce,  buffalo mozzarella, and fresh toppings.  It wasn't heavy, as  pizza can be sometimes; I was able to polish off a 12\" pie all by myself.  As well as pizza they have a selection of other Italian entrees, just like you might find at most any other establishments of this type.  I wouldn't mind trying them on another occasion, but most often when eating in places of this type it's the pizza that I go for, so it's the pizza that I will almost always order!  I have a feeling that the pattern would be repeated here as well, and that it might take several visits to this place before I try anything other than the pizza.  In this case it wouldn't be out of habit or due to behavior patterns, but because the pizza is enough of an attraction.  It's almost as good as Pizzeria Ortica in Costa Mesa.  If you're looking for pizza in the AZ desert, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Typically, no place that claims to be that good ever lives up to the hype and this is no exception.  Let me run this down from the top.  I liked the decor, exposed kitchen, and wine selection.  Both house wines were tasty for a meager $4 a pop.  The service was fantastic for our party of 10, which is a big plus.  However, the draw here is the pizza.  I was already prepared for the premium price on supposedly premium pizza, but such was not the case.  The large white pizza was really lacking the flavor I am used to and the crust just didn't do it for me.  I tried a friends pesto and there wasn't much on there.  As others have stated, they do skimp on the toppings a bit for $2-4 per topping.  In conclusion, I gave it a try but they won't be getting my hard earned money again."}
{"text":"I am sooooooo not a mall person but being that I am married and I've got to do that 'compromise' thing sometimes, I found myself walking around San Tan Mall on a Saturday evening in January trying to find after holiday sale items, we were starving after our long adventure and the delicious pizza smell in the air lead us to Grimaldi's.  It was pretty packed but there was no wait, we sat down at a high top, my favorite of all table tops, and our extremely attentive waiter came over right away. We started off with their lettuce-less antipasto salad, it was super delicious with fresh mozzarella and delicious tomatoes, unfortunately even the large was pretty small and it was over too soon. When we told our waiter we were first timers he recommended their special italian beef pizza, he said it tasted like a philly cheesesteak on a pizza.  He asked if we like spice and since we do he recommended adding jalepeno. Heck yes this was an awesome recommendation, I had to take a little bit of the jalapenos off cause it was a little too spicy but my husband loved it exactly the way it was.  The waiter overheard me tell my husband that it was a little too spicy for me so he apologized and even discounted part of the bill, I wasn't even complaining at all, and would not have, their service was just that AMAZING! This was some of the best pizza we've ever had in Arizona and it made all that mall madness worth it. As soon as our yearly post-holiday diet goal is reached we are going here to celebrate!"}
{"text":"For me, by far the best pizza in town.  I didn't say the best pizza anywhere (I'm from NY so I know there are great places there), but for east valley Arizona grub, this is really, really good.  Arizonans don't like burnt food so I've heard Grimaldi's has had to dial back charring the crust like a traditional brick oven pizza would be cooked, but regardless the pizza is dynamite.  Don't expect to be quick though as Chuck R points out.  Nothing is premade so they are making your pizza, AND EVERYONE ELSES, from scratch.  Good food takes time.  I've never had a service problem ever even when busy.  I take my kids often and they love it as well (and the dough they get to play with while waiting).  If your kids don't like sitting around...consider a to-go order then...they'll be waiting once you order.  Get the caprese salad for an appetizer and don't forget about the cannoli desert...yum."}
{"text":"Service great, food is yummo! Kale salad has the freshh light refreshing dressing and ingredients are crunchy and delightful. Pizza was so good with spicy chicken sausage!"}
{"text":"My coworkers have raved about this pizza place I finally went with then for lunch.   We were greeted promptly, asked for our drinks. Nice atmosphere with a taste of NYC.  The waiter came back and took our order. We all opted for the lunch special of pizza, salad and drink. The salads came back a few minutes later and was a good size with a nice vinegarette.   About 10 minutes later, the pizza arrived. I really enjoyed my pizza. I ate my personal pizza quickly. I wish I had more.sausage on my pizza. That would be my only complaint that each slice had maybe 1 or 2 bits of sausage.   Service was very good. We were in/out within 45 minutes.  This will be a place I will head to for lunch often! Great pizza at a great price."}
{"text":"Great pizza, good salad, not a whole lot more to enjoy since that is all they serve.  Service was good but not real friendly, we did dine in on a Friday night, so our server was a little busy.  Our peperoni and sausage pizza was cooked perfectly.  It did seem a little pricey as my wife and I split a salad and a large pizza and 2 beers and the bill was over $50 bucks.  It is Vegas so who really cares :)"}
{"text":"If you love pizza you'll love Grimaldi's. Tried the newest lcation on Rainbow and everything was first rate."}
{"text":"Love their pizza!!! Very fresh. Their cannoli was really good too. They seem to have great selection of wines."}
{"text":"SO FAR, this is the best PIZZA ive had in scottsdale. the sauce, cheese, crust is all very good. try to savor every bite. im sick of the chain places, and others like Nello's just dont do the trick.   Oregano's is VERY close, but a very different kind of pizza if you compare to their stuffed style.   anyway, i went in by myself and had a pepperoni pizza with 2 beers. 23 bucks. could be worse but def better than delivery!"}
{"text":"Can not get enough of this place. The Pesto pizzas are a religious experience! Service is always excellent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Service was outstanding!  This was by far the best thin crust pizza that I have ever eaten, and the cheesecake was to die for."}
{"text":"We were having lunch provided for us at work on Christmas Eve.  I was put in charge of ordering and picking up food, and my boss instructed me to get pizza from Grimaldi's.  I called and placed the order on the Friday before, and called to confirm the order on that Monday morning.  When i showed up 10 min past the time I told them I wanted to pick up the pizza, I was sure it would be there, however, it was not.  They did not have my order and I was left with 80 hungry people.   That's as bad as the story gets, though.  The manager came over and said they were getting started on my order and that it would be 10-15 more minutes.  Although it ended up being 45 min, we had all the pizzas we wanted.  To top it off, the manager took care of the order for me to make up for being late.  The pizza was of course delicious, and I want to thank Grimaldi's for doing the right thing to keep a customer happy!  I would definitely feel comfortable giving them my business again for another work event.  Mistakes happen, and as long as they do the right thing they're ok in my book.  Thanks Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Been there several times. I want to really like this place, but cant. Food is great, but i dont care for the atmosphere. Seats are uncomfortable and seems the tables are really crammed in. I know this isnt their fault, but parking lot always crowded and busy. Pizza is very good, but evrything else is frustrating."}
{"text":"Some of the best pies in town, it's a shame they are so far from my house."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Victor was amazing! Try the cheesecake Reese's peanut butter. It was so delicious! The pizza was really good, not greesy at all."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!? We come from the land of pizza in the California bay area (of course we'll get arguments on that from Chicago and New York) but this place is simply the best. What they do with ricotta cheese on a pizza is amazingly delicious! And, if you're lucky enough to get a great waiter like we did in J.P., it makes the meal just that much better. My only regret is that I only make it to Vegas once or twice a year so I might just have to campaign for a Grimaldi's  in the bay area."}
{"text":"I love a good pizza and my favorite is Tony's Pizza Napoletana in San Francisco, winner of Best Pizza Margherita at the World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy and Best Pizza Romana at the World Championship of Pizza Makers in 2011.   Let just say the pizza's at Tony's are wonderful but what does this have to do with Grimaldi's Pizzeria?  I am pleased to say based upon my recent dining experience that Grimaldi's is a very strong number 2 in my view. That is a very strong endorsement of Grimaldi's food.  The pizza was traditional, on the thin side and the toppings were of the highest quality (very flavorful).   The service was very attentive and professional.  I sat at the bar dining alone and watching the football game and the female bartender was very attentive to the patrons, knowledgeable and professional.  Overall the restaurant made a very good first impression and I will be returning.  I travel on business weekly and to Phoenix/Scottsdale regularly, I am very happy I found Grimaldi's.    I use Yelp to decide where to eat and thus, I take an objective view of my review and I would strongly recommend this restaurant for pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was fresh and reminds me of New York. The small is actually pretty filling and can feed up to three people. The Bruchetta Trio appetizer's marinated mushrooms with basil is refreshing."}
{"text":"Don't bother with salads! Overpriced and tiny. I would never spend thirty dollars for a few pieces of meat and cheese...no lettuce or dressing. Sorry, Grimaldi's, this doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"I've had pizza from Grimaldi's several times now and it's been outstanding, however, not the case this time.   We ordered specific ingredients which were very skimpy, not worth what was charged!!  The pizza was mediocre at best.  Too bad, will have to look around next time we are up for pizza!!"}
{"text":"Love the pizzas.  Any flavor.  Just wish there were more appetizers to have while waiting.  We aren't salad fans so we wish for other items."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Service was great! Little pricey though $15 for a personal pizza... I will definitely be back. I wanna try a happy hour one night!"}
{"text":"Anybody that thinks this  is good pizza knows nothing about Italian food.Very dry pizza with rubbery cheese.Asked for more sauce and they charged extra$2.00 for some canned tomato sauce.Very limited menu with very over priced wine list."}
{"text":"I am giving them an extra star for customer service satisfaction. Last evening my personal pesto chicken sausage & artichoke pizza came out with a little too burnt crust. Without bringing it to table with rest of party pizza they just cooked another. Due to the wait for a fresh made pizza, I got this comped with multiple apologies. Now that's  excellent service+ a delicious pizza!!"}
{"text":"Great location in Old Town Scottsdale. We were promptly seated, and we opted for a high table in the bar. My boyfriend ordered a tall margarita and said it was the best he's had in a long time. For food we ordered the wedge salad and the Don pizza, both were delicious."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of New York style pizza, this is the place to go in Scottsdale.  Great pie, pretty good service.   Recently I was there with a couple friends. Two of us had lived a short time in NYC and have eaten at the original Grimaldi's, we both think that Grimaldi's in Scottsdale comes very close to the \"real thing.\"  The third guy, a native New Yorker, concedes that it is very good (but disputes that anything outside NYC can be authentic NYC pizza).  So there you have it, if you aren't from NYC and you want an authentic taste of the big apple, or if you ARE from the city and you want to annoy your non- native NYC friends while eating some \"pretty good\" pizza, Grimaldi's in Scottsdale is the place.  (Quick tip, take it for what it's worth: MHO if you order more than one or two items on your pie, the pizza starts to loose its character.)"}
{"text":"So, I Had The 6'' Individual Pepperoni Pizza. It was Ok not great  but Ok. The atmosphere is real nice the service is nice also. I might go again but not anytime soon"}
{"text":"Great crust and sausage. White cheese was good but I would prefer adding some regular cheese as the pizza was very short on cheese. Nice look inside and great staff."}
{"text":"For how long the wait can be, I'm not impressed. I've been here four times; usually with groups of five or more. Grimaldi's was chosen because it was close to where we worked and pizza was a neutral choice. The wait is usually about 30 minutes.   Once seated, you feel a little cramped. There just seems to be to many tables for the space. You're close to climbing over people to get seated or leave.  As far as the food, it's fine but not particularly tasty or inspired. The sauces are on par with any other pizza place. The salads are a good size. When considering sandwiches, they are big but coated in the same lack luster sauce. Finally, if you're having pizza, you better be in the mood for thin crust which will tend to have a little extra char than you might like.   Considering the pizzas are priced per topping, I think (and my party) were most recently disappointed with the spread of toppings. At $2 per, I was just hoping for more meat than we were presented."}
{"text":"I allways loved Grimaldis.i used to eat there A lot but then the one on Queen creek closed witch was near me.we haven't are their in time but my friends have this one near them and they say it's still good.i hope Grimaldis stays in business for along time."}
{"text":"We eat here a lot! I love the people, they remember your face and that's always welcoming. Pizza  was awesome and I've never had a bad meal here. It's perfect...cheap and wonderfully clean!"}
{"text":"My wife and I think this is the best pizza in LV...if you get to eat it.  We just happened to be near the Eastern location yesterday about 5:30 and decided to get a pie. One hour later with all tables around us being served multiple pies we were told by our server it would be another 10 minutes...we talked with our feet and walked.  Moral of this story is the best pie in LV should come with the best service.  Will not dine at this location again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it, because I love the name.  But the pizza was just very bland.   I got the personal cheese and it was fine. I would come back if a bunch of people wanted to go, but would not seek it out for myself.  Good service, but the pizza is pretty average."}
{"text":"Very good NYC style pizza. Ingredients are high quality and fresh. A 16\" pizza is $14-22. I've had the Mediterranean (Greek) salad several times and it's my favorite in Las Vegas. A \"small\" is $9 and plenty for 1-2 people. The salad is always super fresh, vegetables uniformly cut and carefully put together. The dining area is large. Casual dining with white table clothes, brick facade and very clean. Waitstaff is friendly and professional. Full bar with excellent wine list. Great for family dining or a casual romantic meal for two."}
{"text":"I have been going to Grimaldis since I lived in New York. Manhattan Beach location has never disappointed. The one in Las Vegas also top notch. The one in Glendale was just not good. The waiter did not know the menu at all. I asked for Aqua Panna and he said they didn't have it. Said they have Pellegrino. Being a long term me customer I knew they did. I had to express lain the difference of sparkling and still water. The pizza was under cooked. Soggy crust that collapsed like a wet noodle when I picked it up. I asked for it to be cooked more and the waiter said he could not do that. First time in 15 years that I have had a bad experience. Quality control is hard to do when you expand your business and this one will not help them or do them justice if they do not train wait staff and cooks on standards. I am just disappointed because I really push this pizzeria to all my friends. I drive 45-60 minutes from my residence to eat at the closest one to my house once a month. It is always worth the drive. I just want them to be better."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has the best pizza. If You are looking for an affordable pizza place come to Grimaldi's. The servers are so nice and always have suggestions if you are stuck on what to get!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I loved it. Ordered a pizza with half red sauce and half white sauce. We added meatball and ricotta cheese. I loved the white garlicky sauce over the red sauce. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Meatball and ricotta ...or pepperoni and mushroom with extra sauce."}
{"text":"Short: Overpriced, nothing special pizza. You'll find better at Sam's Club or Costco.  Long:  For the most part, the pizza here is no better than what you'll find at Pizza Hut or Dominoes. Tasteless crust, cheap sauce, cheap and skimpy toppings with a tiny bit of cheese. There's only better quality control (how little quality there is) and better service. There's also no specialty pizzas here; just the same toppings you can get anywhere else, you just have to list out what you want. I was really hoping for a margarita pizza, but you won't find one here.  I'm a big pizza fan and I often make my own pizza. So when a friend of mine got a birthday deal to have one free pizza from this place, we visited. We arrived and was ushered over to a table. The waitress and waiters were nice, but a bit too courteous as every-other-minute they were checking on us. You don't need three waiters to refill water people.   We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms. It took a while to come out, but not too long. When it arrived, we noticed the top was just swamped with juice and oil--this became a problem as the pizza became soggy after a few minutes (so I don't recommend ordering out).  The pizza... was acceptable. That's it. Me and my friend found ourselves piling on parmesan cheese and oregano to get some flavor out of the pizza because it didn't have much. Let me break it down:  Good pizza starts at the dough. The bread/crust on this pizza was dull and tasteless. After a while, half of it got soggy. The only good part was the end crust where the over charred it a bit. HOWEVER, this place is suppose to be coal-fired, right? Well, the bottom of the crust was no crispier or better cooked than elsewhere. It wasn't even thin enough to create a cracker-thin crust. I've had proper coal-fire pizza and this place is a joke compared to the real thing.   The sauce is a water-down, flavor-less tomato sauce.   The cheese they put on it, while are slices of mozzarella, are so thin that it doesn't melt nor does it spread out. It's just wavers of cheese that don't give the pizza any flavor.  The toppings are the next joke. The mushrooms were of good size (not the thin sliced version), but the sausage is the frozen/ball sausage every-other pizza joint uses. Nothing special, nothing unique. The same frozen sausage balls.   In the end, I don't recommend this place. I am dead honest about the Sam's Club and Costco thing; they make better pizza and sell it at half the price! HALF THE PRICE! This place is almost a joke after I list everything out, but it's certainly isn't bad. I didn't get sick, I didn't walk out unhappy, but surely I would be pissed if I had paid $20 for that pizza. The birthday deal is worth trying this place, though."}
{"text":"Recommended stop and not disappointed.  Thin crust hand tossed pizza, oven fired. All within view of the dinning area. Wait staff hustled through out our visit. Attentive but not over bearing.  Full bar and patio dining."}
{"text":"Having been a regular at the Old Town Grimaldi's since 2006, when Erica Davis became the Manager at DC Ranch we made sure that we visited there.  I love the way the DC Ranch Grimaldi's is laid out and the view on to the Park behind. Coupled with the air there in DC Ranch, the special water and the coal fired ovens their pizza is without a doubt the very best. .  Our last visit was on the 4th of July.  I'm sure that my wife and I will visit many more times before the end of the year.  Let's see there's a birthday in August."}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza in town. Actually, one of the only acceptable pizza spots in town. I'm a pizza snob from the east coast, and am not easily impressed.  I wouldn't change a thing about the pizza.  My only complaint might be that the people that work at the bar, never seem to notice me waiting to pick up my order, as they continue to talk and mess around with each other.  I have never eaten there, so the servers might be better.  But, at the bar they make it seem like I'm bothering them to do their job.  Other than that small gripe, I love the pizza! I wish they delivered!    And a note to the people that mention weird cheese in their reviews, that's what fresh mozzarella is like. Maybe you have become used to the plastic fake cheese out of a bag from dominos."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places ever! Every single time I eat here, I always end up having stomach pains just because of how much I eat since it's so good. Every time I come back to Vegas, I have to come to Grimaldi's. I almost purposely stay at Venetian or Encore just so I can  have easy access to Grimaldi's pizza."}
{"text":"We went to Grimaldi's when we were in Phoenix a few years ago and still talked about how great the pizza was, so when we came back we had to go again. It did not disappoint. Our server was wonderful, very helpful and making suggestions that put our pizza over the top. I don't remember his name but he was from Dubai. We had caprese salad to start which was so yummy but the pizza was the best we have ever had. I highly recommend Grimaldi's. It's very popular so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"The first time i came to this location, i had a pretty good experience. The pizza was good. crispy and  tasted very fresh. The last couple times i went, the pizza has been soft and not crispy. The last time I went was the worst. My pizza was very soft and wet. I told my server about it and he told me that he will tell his manager about it. He came back 5 minutes later and he said that his manager was on the phone and that he will come back. He came back another 3 minutes after and told me that his manager was still on the phone. This time, I was already furious. I told the server to just do something about it \"now\". Why do I have to wait til the manager gets off the phone? my pizza is soaking wet and soggy! The server was so confused and he said that he doesn't know what he wants me to do because his manager was still on the phone. OMG! I told him that this is really bad customer service. By that time, the manager came by, and apologized and asked if i wanted a new pizza.  I asked them to make me a new pizza but make it to go coz by this time, i have been in the restaurant for 45 minutes. I waited another 15 to 20  minutes for the pizza . i paid the bill and the manager came by and gave me 3 \"$5\" coupon bills for the next time i come in. I was so furious when i left the restaurant. I will definitely not go back. I would have forgiven the bad pizza, but the manager was just so incompetent in dealing with people."}
{"text":"Yes, Grimaldi's is a chain but it has great pizza. I judge a pizza by its crust and its sauce, both of which are really good. The crust is thin, has a nice level of salt, and wood fired. The sauce is a crushed tomato style, light, fresh, and not overly seasoned. The Margarita is slightly unusual in that the basil is added before baking but it works. Pizzas are very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The oven broke, they didn't tell us until it took an hour for 2 pizzas. Then they acted like we should be lucky to eat there despite a terrible dining experience.  Definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"The Pizza BLEW my mind! My new favorite pizza place along with my boyfriend! The service was awesome, friendly and quick! Definitely happy with everything!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Excellent Pizza. They use fresh mozzarella, makes it so it's not super greasy. I love the casual outside seating near the park."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise while looking for a quick slice to get me to dinner.  The pizza here was absolutely delicious.  The fresh ingredients and the thin crispy crust were perfect!  The guys at the bar who served me the lunch special, slice and a drink could not of been nicer.  Great service and a BIG slice of pizza were great!   Please open a location in MD so I can eat your pizza every week!    Thanks."}
{"text":"Ordered a small artichoke and sausage pizza for take-out based on the Yelp reviews below. Ordering was very fast, said it would take about 15 minutes (the place was not very busy). Came back in 15 to pick up, not ready yet. OK, no problem, paid up and waited another 5 minutes. When the pizza came it was surprisingly a little cold. My guess is it was sitting in the back for 5-10 minutes before they sent it up. Not good. The crust was a little bland, but the toppings were decent. If only it were served hot..."}
{"text":"THANKS ALLISON!!!  Scottsdale's Grimaldi is a consistently great place, with good food and excellent service.  Take the other day when Allison was confronted with four golf and baseball weary travelers, looking for some thin crust pizza and vino fino.  Despite the fact we had a few brews before entering the establishment, she was able to keep us under control and take care of our dining needs, doing it all with great style, humor and aplomb.  Thanks for the fine food and great service Allison!!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is the best pizza in phoenix, hands down, no question. Especially this location. I've been to three other valley locations and I'll always go out of my way to eat at this one. They have the sweetest staff too. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because it gets super loud during dinner rush because the tables are so close together (I always prefer to sit in the bar when it's that busy and loud). The other reason it's not five stars is because all three times I've ordered pizza to go it's cold when I get home. So cold that it has to be microwaved which makes it soggy, but it's not a huge deal. I'll still keep going there often."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas visiting and saw they have a few locations now so decided to take some family there to try the pizza. I have been to the Grimaldi's in Houston and it was the best pizza I have ever had.   The pizza was the same here and did not disappoint. I would keep it basic.  Try and stick to two toppings per pizza.  The salads are good. We  ended up with a caprese and house salad. A plain cheese, a pepperoni and mushroom, and a meatball and ricotta pizza.  All were outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. Great service and good food. My kids always choose this place hands down. We recently celebrated our daughters birthday here. Awesome place."}
{"text":"The pizza was super duper delicious. The service was super duper horrible. Took forever for us to get our food. Took forever to get our drinks. Took forever to get our bread......and when it finally came it is because I had to ask the host to bring us some because apparently our server/bartender forgot. And then he brings out bread. Just bread. No butter. No knife. Just a dry plate of bread. Gee.... Thanks? But the pizza was absolutely perfect. So there's that."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had! I am always begging to go back to Grimaldi's. They only have thin crust pizza which bothered me initially because I'm not the biggest thin crust fan, but this place has changed my mind!   The only potential downside (and why I knock off one star) is that it is pretty expensive for pizza. We usually drop around $50 for one pizza to share, a salad to share, an iced tea, and a glass of wine. The taste is worth it though if you have the money to spend!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we waited so long to try this place.  After some serious shopping at the only Nordstrom Rack in the entire Las Vegas/ Henderson we finally got a chance to see what all the fuss is about.  They weren't very busy but we came around 2pm on Sunday, between lunch and dinner.  I like the outdoor area with the bar, they also had the games on but some guy was smoking a strong cigar so we opted to go inside.  They seated us right away but our server didn't even come around until 5 minutes later so I already thought we made a bad choice.  But our waitress was very helpful especially after we told her it was our first time.  The small salads can serve up to 2 people and are all made with a red wine vinaigrette except the Caesar salad.  They have set prices for plain cheese pizza with different sauces and sizes and additional toppings are about $2 each.  We ordered a small house salad- lettuce,red peppers, mushrooms green olives and red onion. There was a lot of dressing but thats the way I like it!  We also ordered a small red sauce pizza with fresh garlic, ricotta and Italian sausage.  When it arrived they stretched it to a large! This was the best pizza we've had in Vegas- ricotta was very creamy and they didn't hold back on the toppings.  Overall we spend just about $30.  We will definitely go back when we are on this side of town since I heard the Summerlin one just isn't as good."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious definitely cannot complain about the taste or the texture everything is good the only problem with this place is the limited menu! They only have pizza, salads and calzones, it would be nice if there was a little bit more variety. They also have desert but I haven't had any yet."}
{"text":"We are from New York & were hesitant to try pizza out here in Las Vegas. This pizza is as close as you can get to NY pizza! It was absolutely delicious! We ordered A cheese pizza and added ricotta & grilled chicken. The dough, sauce, cheese (especially the ricotta! The ricotta was outstanding!), & seasonings were top notch.  The chicken, however, was definitely packaged / not fresh. It didn't match with the delicious fresh ingredients that made up the rest of the pizza. The grilled chicken was honestly kind of creepy & gross. It didn't taste good & some pieces were squishy. It was definitely a little offensive. *This is the only reason I did not give 5 stars.*  Desert was also outstanding. We had the desert trio (you get to pick which 3, which I loved!) and got the caramel apple cheesecake, oreo cheesecake, and tiramisu. The cheesecakes are homemade and you can definitely tell. They were amazing. The tiramisu was so light & fluffy and tasted amazing as well.   Finally, our server Rachel was super friendly, happy, and very attentive. She was great, especially since we were seated all the way in the back, we didn't wait long for anything. She was also very honest about answering questions and I really appreciated that!"}
{"text":"I don't ever recall walking out on a restaurant until my experience here.  I went with a party of 8 on a weeknight.  Only 1/4 of the dining room was filled (at least 10 tables were open) but somehow I was still told that it would be a 20 min wait. Crazy how empty the restaurant was but they somehow still couldn't seat us.  The hostess was rude and quite unfriendly.  All they had to do was slide one small table to make room for a party of 8, instead, we were told to wait.  Then they began sitting a group of 4, another group of 4, and then a group of 6 before us.  And then when I asked about it, I was told, there just isn't any room for a big group.  When I asked why the group of 6 was seated before us when all they had to do was slide one small table, they had no response.  The lesson learned is that if you have a party larger than 6, don't even think about coming here (at least for us, this was the case).  Horrible service, rude, and not big group friendly.  Our kids told us they felt very unwelcomed."}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE Grimaldi's!  The pizza is outstanding, the location is perfect, and we loved our waiter Casey!  He was so personable and helpful.  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Tasteless sauce, bland cheese, somehow they made the garlic bland, I have no idea how one does that.  Someone should introduce the chef to salt. Crust was good.  If you're drunk, this is easily a 5 star place. Although someone sitting here with me that also dined there disagrees, saying that even if she were drunk, it would be tasteless."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had.  I ask them to burn the edges a bit more in traditional coal-fired fashion.  I think they refrain from that more extensively to satisfy local palates.  For me....burn it!!  As a pizza snob born and raised in Chicago I find myself leaning towards NY coal-fired more and more.  Johnnie's Chicago style on Cave Creek Rd. for Chicago thin crust, and Grimaldi's for NY style.  What can I say, it is a heck of a pie."}
{"text":"My family and I went there and ordered 2 large, 1 small and 1 personal pizzas + 2 large salad for 8 people and it's was just perfect. This location is really nice but little bit too loud for having a conversation."}
{"text":"Just had the best pizza in my life. Order one with garlic white sauce and one with red sauce. Good to try both!!!!"}
{"text":"Aug. 22, 2015. As a frequent customer to your 9595 S. Eastern Avenue location I was appalled by our experience on Sat. 8/22/15 at approx. 7:30 p.m. There was a table of 3 men and a woman. One man was drunk and disorderly. So much so, that a nearby table of adults with young children cancelled their order and left because of their foul language. Myself and my guest were likewise offended. One of the men at the table was permitted to enter and dine in bare feet, which was repulsive.   I called for the manager to ask that he take appropriate action. His comment was \"I've already spoken to them and there was nothing more I could do.\" I mentioned to him about the man being permitted to dine in bare feet and that being a health issue and potentially liability should he step on glass or other foreign matter. He just shrugged his shoulders and said \"I'm sorry.\"   This manager was approximately 6'3\" and 250 lbs. and seemed frightened to confront and order them to leave. I heard from some of the other dinners and they too were appalled and disgusted that the \"manager\" just let these unruly persons ruin their dinner as well. This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had and will think twice before returning to that location."}
{"text":"Went here for a bday party last night, service was way to slow then food came at various times so some folks in the party were half done while others plates were just arriving. Manager knew but didn't seem to care. Pizza was good but crust was barely cooked. If you have moderate standards this place may disappoint."}
{"text":"Wow! Worse service ever! Starring Tammy, server with a bad attitude... Apparently server Tammy felt it was appropriate to take out her frustrations on her customers, specifically the Asian ones. She offered no apologies or acknowledgement that service was slow, but did successfully tell us that she had 12 OTHER tables to take care of. Read: she didn't care that we were unhappy and was quick to just hand us our bill. We had a show to catch but I still called out the manager to express my dissatisfaction. Not only did our food take forever, parties that seated after us received their food and requests before us, no one checked on us and even the food runner gave us attitude. We had empty cups and had to flag down service. What was really appalling was they had my mom get out of her seat and stand there while new customers walked through past our table. There was obviously not enough walking room since the tables were too close together on that side, but alternatively the hostess could have walked the customers around our table on the side with a wider pathway. So inconvenient and inconsiderate.   We were so so upset and management didn't provide anything to make us feel better about the situation. Zero tip."}
{"text":"My family eats here often. One if the best pizza places in the valley. Fresh ingredients. The salads and desserts are really tasty too. We are picky about our pizza and hard to please and this is 1 of 3 places we will eat pizza at in the Valley."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Las Vegas.  Admittedly, I sometimes prefer the deep dish pizza across the street at BJ's Brewery or the Neapolitan style pizza of Settebello at the District.  However, the coal fired brick oven pizza at Grimaldi's remains my undisputed favorite."}
{"text":"First Visit today. The Meatball Pizza is Awesome but order to go. Wanted salad but no ranch there. Unexperienced, over worked wait staff.  I didn't notice the tables were small at first but stuff piled up. Waitress never cleared off anything,  menu, wine carafe,  even the check! Didn't look at us after our order. Asked for waters with extra lemon to start got 1 lemon in 1, 2 in the other had to give my daughter my 1 and take the rinds. My daughter needed water refilled had it at the end of the table she walks by 7 times never looks, couldn't hear or see me get her attention or try to ask . Had to stop my daughter from raising her hand and watch her guzzle the Dr Pepper I didn't want her to drink much of. A Busboy saw me and gave her a water with 3 lemons!! She finally checks on us, wow. When we were ready ask for rest to go she zips by and finally took the menu, not a word, and leaves my empty water at the end of the table, Choking on crust! I waive for water she looks back but just keeps going. I\"m laughing out loud at this point!  Trying to make due with the wine I had left. Finally got water and asked for rest to go, she takes 2 slices and leaves the third. Comes back and doesn't want to wrap it in foil, has the nerve to tell me to shove it in with the rest! Which is wraped in foil. Ruin the like the rest then wants to rip open the foil in front of my daughter, rudely like!!! I can't say more. Go elsewhere for a nice meal indoors with your kids. Order a meatball pizza to go it is awesome! My daughter LOVED IT! I DID TOO!"}
{"text":"Been to this location 6-8 times and have never had a disappointing experience. Thin crust Pizza ALWAYS rocks. Their salads are huge and actually really good. Service is always great. It's always pretty busy but they seem to be able to handle things well. Their menu reflects that they are known for: pizza!  We enjoy sitting outside when it's nice out. Grimaldis is a family favorite and always will be."}
{"text":"My honey & I were extremely disappointed in the Pizza at this Grimaldi's location, The first pizza was cooked way too long. It was obvious our waiter thought so as he put it on our table. We gave it the benefit of our doubt but took one bite & knew it was going back. It was hard, dry with burnt edges. Our waiter took it back without any questions & had a new one made (& we appreciated it) We received another one but by that time I was over the whole experience. ( it shouldn't have even been brought to the table over cooked to begin with) when we got our bill we were both disappointed to see nothing was taken off our bill. No compensation at all. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"These guys make a damn good pizza!  I usually get chicken on pizzas, but skip it here. It is very watery and not high quality. Dominos has a better chicken topping. Go with the roasted red peppers! I do agree with a previous reviewer, they are a bit stingy on the toppings.  Don't get me wrong--this is the best pizza you will find in AZ.  These guys take their time and even have a water filtration system to balance it the same as NY's water. Think the water doesn't matter when you are making the dough--Think Again!   Also give the house red a try. I usually do not enjoy the house wines very much, but at Grimaldi's, it is actually my fav.  This is a great place for a first date--you will not break the bank and you can really enjoy some quality pizza and wine."}
{"text":"First, it took about 5 minutes of waiting before we were even noticed. Then the host told us just to sit wherever (why have a podium and a host if tou have open seating?) Our host said it would be another 15 minutes because they stoke the fire at 4, but when we sat down our waiter said it would be 45 minutes. We waited and when we got our pizza it was extremely soggy, we couldnt even hold it without one hand on the bottom. Our waiter only showed up once to half fill my water. Overall not a good experience. Go to a different grimaldi's"}
{"text":"This establishment refused to deliver to cash paying customers at the Four Seasons Scottsdale.  I called back a second time to ensure my order was coming...35 mins AFTER my promised 20 mins and was told it was on the way.  Nothing ever came.  I guess we will burn the cash instead.  That is a better use than a place which refuses to deliver."}
{"text":"I love this place! The staff is always friendly and the pizza is amazing. Its expensive but so worth the money. My boyfriend and I love to go here. The crust and sauce is what makes this pizza the best. I enjoy their desserts as well."}
{"text":"The Best pizza that I have ever tasted they r a little slow on service So order 2 drinis at one time"}
{"text":"I really love Grimaldi's pizza. The cheese is delicious, the crust is perfect, and it has the perfect cheese to sauce ratio; however the service is so bad here. For the most part the servers are apologetic, but others are just plain rude. There are always screaming infants at this restaurant and huge parties.  You will be forgotten if you are not in a party of six.  We had Kendell as our waitress. I've never had a waitress argue with me regarding how long the food was taking. I timed when we were sat to when the pizza arrived..40 min Kendell! Kendell made sure to correct me at 30 min. Uh, you might want to save your tip and not correct your customers. Anyway, I may only come here during the weekdays and never on weekends."}
{"text":"I arrived at this Grimaldi's to place a Take Out. The place was jumpin', they were slammed. But the hostess was excellent, operating the floor like a pro. Everyone was promptly greeted, serviced, and treated well. When I asked her to place an order, she let me know how long the orders were taking and never let me feel rushed. While I waited she asked if I wanted water.   The service didn't stop with her. All the staff behaved like this. Eye contact, smiles, and eagerness. I observed other crew members helping customers with the same enthusiasm.   Very different from other Grimaldi's I've been to. No wonder this place was packed."}
{"text":"Food is good but the prices are high. This Old Town is a nice area but the restaurant is average with cleanliness, neatness, and customer service. Offers up the mean common denominator on what you may expect.   I've been coming here regularly for almost a year and at first I thought it was just the tired staff in the early evening for their \"can't-wait-to-get-off-shift\" approach. But, it's the same tired staff month after month. Nothing's changed.   I'm not so critical that I won't order food; the experience is average. But the group chooses this as the venue for monthly meetings, so here I go."}
{"text":"We had the caesar salad-  good, but slightly pricey at 6 bucks.  We got the Small (pretty big actually) 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 white pizza.  It was really good - pepperoni was a little thick so it was a pretty salty bite.  That said, this is one of the best, authentic, NY style pizzas I've had since coming back from NYC.  Just pretty darn expensive, like NYC.  Guess the whole coal burning, specially calibrated water pump and free range mozzarella costs that pretty penny.  So basically, our bill was $32 for a small caesar, small pizza with one topping, an Iced Tea and a rootbeer.  Again, it was good, but I probably wouldn't go there very often, even if there was a location in Socal."}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch at Grimaldi's since we were in the area. Rhianna was our server and was very attentive and friendly.  We got a small pizza with red sauce, pesto, ricotta, meatballs, and garlic. The pizza was delicious and we liked how we could customize it the way we wanted.   The manager was really nice. She checked on us a couple times and made sure we were happy and satisfied. Overall, it was a great experience and will definitely be back to try other pizzas!"}
{"text":"They service was great, they food was horrible!  The salad taste like they just soaked it in oil, no flavor at all and they have no other dressings except oil and vinegar.  The pizza was ok, nothing at all to brag about.  I will never go eat there again. It was over priced and not good at all."}
{"text":"pizza was good, $17 large cheese pizza  togo. pizza rock better. bar staff and togo staff was great very nice and good looking people."}
{"text":"We stopped into the Chandler location for dinner on a Monday evening and it was nice and quiet. I'm told on the weekends, there is a waiting list. We ordered a large pie and it was indeed pretty delicious.  The hostess was very friendly, staff was wonderful, and Frank was a great character! A true East Coaster. The decor was great! Definitely feels like you've left Arizona when you set foot inside.  If you're from back east or would like an experience without travelling far, Grimaldi's Pizzeria is definitely somewhere to try."}
{"text":"Can pizza get any better? Not about the toppings - this is the place for great crust. Baked to slightly charred perfection in the coal oven (Pennsylavania Anthracite - just like in Brooklyn) . Simple tasty sauce, probably San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella. Try with the the house roasted red peppers."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's was the first restaurant I ate at when I moved here and I've always enjoyed eating out on the patio.  The staff is great and made me feel welcome and pizza and calzone's are incredible.   Definately my favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place but when i asked for ranch they told me they didnt have any, what place does not have ranch, the pizza was still good but i was bummed about no ranch"}
{"text":"First disappointing Grimaldi's experience. The pizza was, as usual, delicious (hence the 2nd star). But we ordered a large house salad with grilled chicken. Absolutely awful. I think there was one mushroom (maybe), 1/2 a roasted pepper, and I'm 99% sure the chicken was that nasty, nasty stuff you get in the ziploc bags in the grocery store cold cuts aisle. You know, \"grilled chicken strips\" that has like 15 other ingredients in it, none of them pronounceable. Worst $13 salad I've ever had. Maybe you say \"big deal, a bad salad, it's a pizza place!\" but I say the fact that they use the fake chicken speaks volumes about their quality control. Grilled chicken is also listed as a pizza topping. And it was $4 extra for the salad, and $5 on pizza! Gross. Makes me not want to go back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"We called in an order for take out pizza and were told the pizza would be ready in 45 minutes. We arrived after 35 minutes and picked up our order. We only live about 5 minutes away, but when we got home and started to eat, the pizza was already cold. Also, the flavor was nothing special and it was expensive! We won't be going back. Found another place that is less expensive, the service is great and the pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"Nice comfortable family place. We had a very good cold antipasto followed at a custom designed pizza. We will return."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but nothing special.  Seriously overpriced - every topping is another $2 and they double charge you if you do half and half with different toppings."}
{"text":"I have to say the service was terrible. we didn't see our server for an easy 15 minutes no refills server had an attitude, to many good places to eat to be treated like this when they are not even busy."}
{"text":"Where do I begin, to tell the story? Familiar line I think. Let's start with all the great reviews I read about this place! Someone is desperate just to say they left their boring homes. I ordered my pizza by phone to be picked up. 1. I'm told they don't have green peppers only sweet red. Fine I can handle that.  2. I'm told 20 minutes it will be ready.  I arrive in 15. The pizza is ready. But it takes 10 minutes for the bartender, who is also the carry-out cashier to wait on me. 3. The pizza is no longer piping hot.  4. The pizza was supposed to be Italian sausage & \"Red peppers\"! I'm posting a photo of the pizza. See if you can find the sausage. I think there is more sausage on McDonald's sausage biscuit sandwich. I can here Clara Peller yelling \"where's the beef\" from her grave. 5. The only reason that I'm able to give this place a star, is because the pizza was in fact very tasty. The sausage was very good when you could find a bite. Good sauce and fresh peppers.   I will probably try them again and order double sausage. Maybe I can put it all on one half and say I'm eating a SAUSAGE pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza restaurant!  I've eaten at both the Scottsdale and Chandler locations.  Both serve good food.  The Don is my favorite with Kale Salad.  Delicious!  I've always received good service for dine-in and dine-out.  Recommended!!"}
{"text":"The food is a solid one star. (The service was good, but that doesn't warrant an additional star because service is supposed to be good. People primarily go to a restaurant to eat. The food is the most important, and as such, that's what this review will focus on.)  Here are the problems with the food:  1. Their pizza falls *squarely* in the camp of new age pizza: bland, very thin and sparse cheese, and a thin, tomato mash instead of sauce. Each and every slice has a gaping section where there's simply no cheese (see the first photo I posted). And it's intentional (apparently stylish in the mind of whoever runs the place). The very thin, sparse cheese and the mini pepperoni are the blandest I've ever tasted. All you're really eating is crust (see the second photo I posted).  Grimaldi's is fru-fru California-style pizza. This is really a problem because...  2. The very heavily themed retro/historic New York City ambience - the walls are covered in large, historic prints of NYC, bottles of wine abound, and right down to the Italian-sounding name of the place - leaves no other impression than a pizza place that offers normal/NY style pizza: the kind of pizza where there's no shortage of cheese, the pepperoni isn't bland, and the sauce is actually sauce. The thin, floppy crust is just there for something to hold onto. But here at Grimaldi's, all you're really eating is stiff, crunchy, a little-too-thick crust.  If you're going to visually sell yourself as some sort of relocated NYC pizza joint, then serve NYC style pizza! Grimaldi's needs to do two things: (1) change their name to something non-Italian, and (2) redecorate the interior to remove all traces of NYC. Maybe bright, pastel colors? Something to more accurately depict the new age style pizza they serve.  If all of the above wasn't frustrating enough, the tables in this place are too close together. You're packed like sardines. While trying to clean off a table, a worker knocked over a chair on the other side of the the table, and a customer nicely picked it up for him because there's no way the worker could contort himself to pick it up himself.  Due to the very heavily tourist-passing-through-and-doesn't-know-any-better crowd, this sardine seating arrangement translates to a VERY noisy environment. Despite being 2 feet away from the people I was with, we all had to practically scream to hear each other.  Summary: if you want pizza that's practically all crust with bland, sparse toppings that serve as little more than a garnish, and you like screaming to communicate, then by all means come to Grimaldi's.  Otherwise go somewhere else where you'll actually be served real, satisfying pizza."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come to this location more times than I can count and at various times of the day. The food has never been anything but perfect. We always order a pizza with pepperoni, bacon,  garlic and basil and it is always amazing. We are pizza lovers and this is pizza we love.  The music is uplifting and the staff is always friendly.   Last time I decided to try a Cesar salad not expecting to be wowed by it because most salads are romaine cores with wilted lettuce. This was none of that.  The romaine was a lovely green, fresh and crunchy. The dressing was lovely and not over done. The croutons are oven roasted and delicious. The entire small salad is enough to feed two with pizza or one really hungry person. I love this place. Service is generally prompt but worth the wait we have endured."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. New York thin crust style. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent, this pizza does not disappoint. Quality is the same as the Brooklyn, NY location. Great service, beautiful location."}
{"text":"I only grabbed a pepperoni pizza for takeout, so I can't review the wait staff, but my goodness it was good.  I had been to the Summerlin location months ago for lunch where I split a salad and a white pizza with 4 friends.  It was incredible there and the pizza I ordered for takeout on Eastern was quite amazing as well.  A large 18\" 1 topping pizza was roughly $20.  Little pricey for a thin crust with only 1 topping, but the ingredients were top notch.  If you share a large pizza and salad with drink with 3 other friends you'll probably end up at roughly $10 a person  A large would probably feed 3-4 adults, and it's a very good thin crust pizza with slices of fresh mozzarella, small spicy bits of pepperoni and delicious sauce.  When I'm in the mood for a thick crust, Rosati's makes a great Chicago style, but when I'm in the mood for a good East coast style pizza, Grimaldi's has impressed both me and my friends twice now."}
{"text":"I've been going to Grimaldi's in Scottsdale for more than a decade and have always loved it. That first steaming bite of a Grimaldi's pizza used to be something wonderful that you could not experience outside of New York. Lately, however, something's changed. Either they're using a new recipe for sauce or crust or have made some other change, but everything's more bland. One of the servers admitted there had been some changes. I'd guess that something has forced them to cut corners, but the pizzas now  have almost a commercial taste. Sorry to have lost one of my favorite places to eat but I can't pay 50.00 for a pizza that I could get in any chain establishment."}
{"text":"Look, I love Grimaldi's, it's some of my favorite pizza around. But when I call in an order for take out 15 minutes before I arrive, and they tell me it will be ready in 15 minutes, I expect it to be just about out of the oven when I get there. I do not expect the order to get \"released\" to the kitchen when I show up. So now my short, precious lunch break is ruined while I was told I had to wait 20 more minutes after my pizza should have already been done. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"You can't get a much better pizza than this. Love this place always clean and good service."}
{"text":"I found the Boca location to be horrid...I ordered a pizza to go, it was ice cold when i got home and i live 5 minutes away the dough was tough on whole the worst pizza i ever had. I will never go here again. to many  good  pizza places  in Summerlin to go here.  Please note never had a problem in Green Valley and pizza was always great and service good.went there for yrs when i lived in Henderson,  Just stay away Boca"}
{"text":"My credit card was charged $10 above the amount I signed for at this Grimaldi's location.  I suggest you check your credit card statement to make sure your charge is accurate."}
{"text":"Great Pizza spot in the heart of Old town Scottsdale.We got here really late and this is one of the few place that was open at 11 p.m for dinner and coal fired brick-oven pizza sounded tempting then.  We started with the Caprese Salad, fresh handmade mozzarella cheese and fresh tomatoes hit the spot. We decided to share a small pizza with grill chicken and Pesto. The NY style pizza was tantalizing in aroma, baked to perfection with a crisp crust. The small pizza was actually more than sufficient for two people."}
{"text":"Reading other reviews on here is laughable.  PEOPLE IT\"S THIN CRUST PIZZA.  If you don't like thin crust then stay away from this place.  It's also COAL FIRED OVEN.  If you don't understand this,, the coal heats at a higher temperature than fire or other means leaving this thin crust cooked crisp with a few chars here and there.  Anyway, I dislike thick crust pizzas because my opinion is the crust can absorb/take away from the flavors on the pizza.  When Grimaldis opened (I actually was a subcontractor for part of the building so I was aware as it was coming into town) I decided to try and I absolutely think it's the best pizza in Vegas minus specialty gourmet pizzas which I give to Metro. The crust in my opinion is great, the fire roasted pepper yummy, the thick pepperoni, sausage extremely flavorful, And get this ,, the few people in here complaining about the cheese IT\"S WHOLE SLICED MOZZARELLA.  I don't know if you understand that when a pizza place uses pre shredded cheese it looses some flavor as it has to be preserved  and prevented from hardening and sticking together.  The whole slices of cheese on Grimaldis pizza adds a great effect and provides in my opinion the best flavor the cheese can offer. If you want piles of shredded cheese that starts stretching and stringing as you have to keep pulling it away from you as you try to eat then you won't like Grimaldis.  Basically, IT's all about proportions.  I think Grimaldis has found the best, crust,cheese, sauce proportion for me. I can taste everything without getting full on the first slice.  Also, sign up for their email and get a free large pizza every year for your Birthday,, it's a great deal LOL. If you decide Grimaldis doesn't have the toppings you desire then there's only one other place in vegas and that is Metro."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza we have ever had! And price is good (very reasonable for two persons) and service is top! We had a small pizza to share (16 inch) and a bottle of wine (they have tastings Tuesday where everything wine is 50% off!). Will definitely recommend this place :-)"}
{"text":"Delicious crispy and always done the way you want it. This is one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten. The ambiance is great, the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"The pizza here is yum, but a little expensive.   I ordered a pizza with onions, garlic and tomato, and it happened to be one of the best I've had in my short lifetime!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza. Staff is pretty friendly. Would come here again."}
{"text":"I waited 50minutes for a damn pizza....I ordered on the phone when I got there I paid and they told me my pizza is coming up next. Few minutes later a manager told me only a couple more minutes is ready but 15 more minutes later and still waiting.....when I finally got the pizza and when home. After I came home I opened the pizza I realized the pizza is so wet and doesn't taste right."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!! We were looking for a quick bite that wasn't before our flight and found this spot In the mall. We were shocked at how incredible the pizza was and the salads were fantastic and perfect for sharing. The server was super nice and very attentive and can't believe how good the pizza was!  Missing one star because the hostess was a bitch. She was super rude to the people of us and then to us. Please fire her. She was working Thursday- Aug 20,2015 at 7p. Get rid of her she's awful."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas this week, we were desperate for a good wood-fired style pizza and yelp reviewers helped us out and came through with accurate descriptions and were right-on with quality.  Needless to say, coal-fired pizza is now our new favorite.  Initially we drove from the strip out to S. Rampart to get away from the congestion.  To our dismay, they said they had to clean the ovens (before the dinner rush hour) and we walked out totally disappointed.  Not 30 seconds later, waiter Moe, comes running out and says they can hold off with cleaning after our pizza.  Nowhere else would I have ever experienced someone who really understood and cared enough to do that.  Anyone else would have shrugged their shoulders and said \"oh well\".   We ordered the roma tomato, fresh mozarella, and basil pizza.  Any other Margherita type pizzas are scarce with all their ingredients, but not this one.  I couldn't believe how it was made with the eater in mind.  A bite of everything in every bite.  No skimping on their end.  We also ordered the caprese salad for an appetizer and it was outstanding, in flavor, presentation and portion size.  The moz they import from NY is so fresh and tender.    We will definitely be back on our next visit to LV.   Now we go back to VA where I have to drive 45 minutes for our second favorite pizza, wood-fired grilled.   Thanks Grimaldi's on S Rampart and thanks Yelp reviewers of all the Grimaldi locations for leading us to a great find!  NQ"}
{"text":"What. The. F*ck... Am I losing my mind or has the whole world gone mad? We make stupid people famous. E.g kim kardashian, Miley cyrus or whoever the flavor of the week is. Stop making stupid people famous!  And stop over hyping bullsh*t food! This is the furthest thing from good pizza. If this good pizza then I'm the Pope who's having a really and day.  Im going to admit that I am stupid. I keep falling for the hype and I'm constantly getting punished with bad food.  I've given up on trying to find good pizza in CA. Many of my friends said that Grimaldi's the shiz but it's in vegas. You know that saying about whatever happens in vegas? This pizza should never leave vegas. Grimaldi's, stay put because your pizza is fraudulent. You do not serve \"NYC style pizza\", you serve a sub par version of the same thing I can get at a pieology franchise and it's waaaaaaay less expensive. Pieology also labels their pizza properly. Grimaldi's, you serve neopolitan style and you do it poorly.  Once the pizza arrived at our table, just looking at it, I was already disappointed. It was burnt, not browned. The sauce looked like it just came straight out of a BPA lined can.   When i took my first bite, I noticed that it was under seasoned and that blaring red sauce was way too acidic. Have these cooks ever heard of using sugar to cut down on the acid? WTF, this is amateur sh*t people! This is pizza sauce 101. I made a better pizza with a boboli crust when I was a kid and I didn't even know what the f*ck I was doing back then.  Also, I have never had a pizza turn my hands black. Yes, my hands were black. (See napkin picture)  This place is a bust. Over priced. Over hyped. The odds will be against you. The \"pizza\" only lives up to the first part of its namesake, \"Grim\"."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first cause it was thin crust till I tasted it. Pizza is straight delicious  Omg!  I got the large pepperoni with mushrooms and onions! Off the hook! :-D"}
{"text":"BEWARE the pizza at both Grimaldi's locations is TASTELESS !!!!!!!! Go to 800degrees for a 100 times better quality original neapolitean pizza and it's even cheaper.  This is my 3rd time at Grimaldi over the past year (i sadly went twice in the mall and once in the palazzo location). Even the soda each time was 99% ice and a sip of coke, it was like drinking flavored water. Please don't make my same mistake and tell them NO ICE if you want to have a taste of soda.  The tomato sauce it is flavorless, so you will see people adding salt like crazy to try to revive a cardboard tasting pizza. The cheese taste like rubber, flavorless as well. The dough is bad but not as bad as the tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.   Do not believe brick oven and this gimmick terminology they use. Brick oven means the oven is made with brick, it doesn't mean wood burning oven. So basically brick oven doesn't mean anything.  One last issue is that for some reason the pizza has been each time barely warm and after you eat the second slice the rest of the pizza will be cold. Just be prepared.  Event the secret pizza at the Cosmopolitan and the pizza at the Aria is better! I personally don't like either of them but compared to Grimaldi they are great. My favorite, as I mentioned is 800degrees. Try it and you will thank me!!!!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizza confounds my family. It is always packed, to the point where they claim to be booked all day, but when we finally get in it is simply the most mediocre pizza.  We were given gift cards thirteen months ago. Four times, including this afternoon, we tried to make reservations but were told that they were booked for the entire day. Finally I asked if I could cash in the gift cards because using them has proved impossible. The hostess was able to find us a table when I requested a refund.  After we were seated, we looked around at the dining room. There were at least six empty tables. Six! We arrived at 1:30. Our pizza wasn't served until 2:10. During those 40 minutes, two of those six tables were seated. Why claim to be booked out and have tables sit empty for 40 minutes?  The pizza and calzone were mediocre at best. The crust was chewy and flat. There is a lack of salt and pepper, it seems. The salad had only four ingredients so I paid the extra 5 dollars to put chicken in it.  The service was average. I do not see us going back."}
{"text":"Staff is incredibly rude and appear to be entirely uninterested in customer service. Took my father who uses a walker and staff could not have been more unfriendly and lacking in empathy. Would NEVER go to any Grimaldis again after this treatment."}
{"text":"Rude staff, rude manager, and slow service.  We have given it three separate tries and it is the same every time. Perhaps I am overly critical of the rudeness because I work in hospitality. However, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The meals was so delicious.  The server, amazing.   We have been on a quest for authentic Italian food since we returned from Italy and this was pretty darn close.  In addition, the prices were reasonable for the strip."}
{"text":"I came here the night because they offer a coupon for your birthday! It's a large pizza with one topping. I wanted to try this place for a while, so it was the perfect time to take advantage of this offer.   I went with a friend and we ordered a large white pizza that came with garlic. We picked toppings of Mushroom and Sausage. We also ordered a house salad. I thought everything tasted amazing. The house salad really needed some cheese to make it perfect, though. The salad had romaine, tomatoes, olives, peppers. We requested the olives to be taken out. It is a pretty large salad. The small would feed about 3-4 people if they wanted a side. I thought the pizza was amazing. I love white pizza, and I love garlic!"}
{"text":"Very good food all around. It's getting harder and harder to find good pizza joints. As mom and pop restaurants cease to exist ( thanks government).This is one of the few."}
{"text":"I am from Long Island and know a thing or two about good pizza and while this is a little different than the pizza I grew up with this pizza is hands down the best pizza I have had since I left NY in 1989. I got the meatball pizza. Me and my four kids devoured an 18\" pie in minutes. If you like thin pizza with a slightly charred crust that you get from the coal fired ovens then you really gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Pizza was crazy good, Eric and Cisco top services....Eric got good pizza recommendation. Cisco known his sh**t in beer and wine."}
{"text":"We had one white pizza and one red.  First off, the crust was great!  Crispy, flavorful as it should be.  The red sauce was good and we had extra sauce on ours along with 3 or 4 other toppings.  The white pizza was very flavorful even though it was just cheese.  The pizza is a little pricey (large red pizza with 5 toppings was almost $30) but we would still go back."}
{"text":"Just okay. Went here for a party. The pizza was thin which I liked but the pizza itself was lacking flavor.   The service was good but the pizza could be better."}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere here! Love the lights made from wine bottles.... the pizza is really good and the thin crust makes its light on the stomach. The manager that we spoke with there was extremely friendly and helpful. Anytime we are there he says hello, i really appreciate that!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this. Pizza took over an hour with a 1/3 occupancy at 3 pm. Would have missed the movie after dinner.  Our server was good but no one bothered to help her while others stood around. Even manager ignored our obvious needs: refills,check processed..."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza that I've ever had. I absolutely love the white pizza because I don't  Like tomato sauce"}
{"text":"Wonderful wait staff and quick service on a Friday night.   Enjoyed the pizza because of the sauce,  the crust and leftovers.   Pricing is high, dining area was cramped and the temperature was not very cool."}
{"text":"Great pizza! So tasty and well made! Nice staff! One of our favorites pizza ever! My husband and I love it"}
{"text":"Great pizza! We had dinner here tonight for my sons 8th birthday. We ordered a large pepperoni  and large sausage. Pizza was great . They gave the children pizza dough to keep them busy.  Would definitely  come back for any other occasion or whenever we are in the mood for pizza. Staff was great also. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"The aroma of pizza from outside the Palazzo literally brought my husband and I in and upstairs. I'm so glad it did because this was hands down some of the best pizza I've EVER had! I consider myself a bit of a pizza critic, lol We had had the \"secrect pizza\" in Vegas the night before. All I can say is \"what a joke\"! Grimaldi's was so good and I can not wait to go back. Service was also great. The manager(I forgot his name) came over and told us the story of Grimaldi's. He was super nice and came back to see how we liked everything. I told him it was amazing and I promised him I would write this review because I was so impressed."}
{"text":"I came in to Grimaldis tonight to pick up dinner for my family. When I placed the order over the phone, I was told my pizza would be ready at 5:25. When I arrived I was told that my order had never been released and that they would be putting it in the oven.  The manager came over to me right away and apologized and offered to buy me a drink at the bar. I enjoyed a drink and was attended to by the very pleasant bartender.  This is a carbon copy of how a customer should be treated when a mistake is made. Props to you Grimaldis for turning a not so great experience into a wonderful one"}
{"text":"Really really good pizza! Yum-o! good service at the bar while waiting!! :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Thin crust and the sauce is very authentic. ot greasy and unoriginal cheese like most places. Our server was super friendly and had great  recommendations which wine and salad would pair nicely with what pizza. We will definitely be back again. Waiter was patient and funny."}
{"text":"My favorite local pizza spot to eat with the family or on a date night. love the pepperoni and garlic pizza. So yummy! Great service and relaxed environment. They will even hold your pizza if you have a movie to catch."}
{"text":"Located in the back of the shopping center in the Venetian it's worth the walk to get to.  We made two pizzas for 4 people and it was definitely more than enough, especially after getting salads and the tomato w/ mozarella.   The pizzas were very good and made fresh. If you're looking for a NY style pizza with thin crispy crust, sauce on the top, then the is the place you need to go. The pizzas are a decent price but every time you want to add something you'll see your money fly onto the top of the pizza. Everything you want to add costs something which is the downside. Pesto $2, shrooms $2, chicken $4, etc etc. I think those are the prices but you get the point. It cost a good amount to make the perfect pizza you want. Don't be afraid to make a half half pizza either.   The pizzas overall were really good. Take your time in this place because they make everything to order but it's worth the wait. Sit down, relax and enjoy your hot pizza. Come to this place and take a break from Vegas and lose yourself in the NY themed place."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is by far the best pizza place around I wish I could add more stars you will not be disappointed The closest I found  to authentic Italian pizza from Italy"}
{"text":"I came here as part of a walking food tour my husband and I took during our stay in Scottsdale. Grimaldi's pizzas are really good, i'm not a huge pizza fan but I was definitely impressed! We tasted the pepperoni and cheese pizza and the vegetarian pizza, the crust on both pizzas was perfect! We will definitely be back next time we are in Scottsdale :D"}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't that great a little more expensive and you get a thin hard crust with very little sauce and patches of cheese it was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Glad we ordered half original pizza and half white pizza, with italian sausage topping.  Glad my friend liked the white pizza more, because I liked the original pizza. Glad the pizza came out perfectly, the bottom not being burnt.  Glad one of the worker is a Dodgers fan.   P.S. Tommy Lasorda eats here when he's in town.   Amazing pizza makes me really happy."}
{"text":"Great food great service, second time here and it was great we went with Cesar salad to start which came out quickly then We had the small pesto pizza with grilled chicken,ham,bacon and pepperoni great pizza everything was great an tasted great, after we had the original style cheese cake which was very good almost to the standards of maria calendars, overall great experience dinning here recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Great pizza we had the pesto with ham,bacon,pepperoni, and mushroom, they did mess up our order but for that the gave us a NY cheesecake that was very good, overall great service an delicious"}
{"text":"wierd pizza, tomato sauce on the top, cheese on the bottom, the cold tomato gravy ruins the pizza, paid my bill and left most of the pizza, if i wasn't starving would have left all of it."}
{"text":"The pizza maker was gross.  Touched everything and every one.  Hope he washes his hands.  The hostess needs to wear more clothes! !! Cover up!"}
{"text":"I went with my wife and we loved the pizza. A nice change from factory pizza. I will go back and recommend this place to all."}
{"text":"Yeah, it was ok, pizza was tasty, so was the salad. I wasnt BLOWN out of the water about anything. So thats why I give it 3 stars. Great, attentive server (Suzanne) answered any questions I had, polite and friendly, because of her, I'll give an extra star."}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to california for NY pizza.  I miss NY pizza so much!!  I come here everytime i go to vegas and i usually order a couple pies and take it home.  Not as good reheated but still better than anything in LA....garlic and sausage is a can't miss combination...."}
{"text":"Another wonderful experience at Grimaldi's in the Scottsdale Quarter.  It was my wife's birthday and we celebrated with a couple of pizzas and some wine.  Our server was Devin and he couldn't have been nicer.  In fact as always the pizza was very good but the way we were treated was even better.  This isn't only my favorite pizza restaurant, it is my favorite restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Best new york style pizza around.. brickoven, thin crust, fresh quality ingredients. Little Pricy but worth it. Will go back"}
{"text":"Would absolutely go back for some good pizza pie!  Although a bit pricey for what you get the pizza was very good. We even ordered togo which is usually a big no no for us a 3 minute blast in the oven brought the pizza back beautifully. Not my business but staff had a huge chip on their shoulder about the owners wife and were not afraid  to let guests hear about it. It did not affect the expedition of our food but still, don't need to hear it kids! Cheesecake might be the most honest representation of NYC I've seen. Yum!!! The one star that is missed is due to that fact the salads are thrown together with sub-par ingredients, although that's not why I went so oh well! Would I go back, Sure! Would love to try the pie straight out of the oven!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened and have never been disappointed.  Simple food done in a delicious way.  We always have 2 large pizzas and a salad and have enough for  the meal and for the next day.  Service is top notch.  Our server tonight was Daniel and he was great.  JB who has been our server many times came by to say hello. Also spent some nice time with Jeff, the manager who always takes the time from his busy duties to say hello.  If you get a chance, go and then check out all of the shops at the Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"After moving from Scottsdale, AZ to Bosie, ID.  The food at Grimaldi's is just the same quality....another words, the best!!!!  The atmosphere is cozy and staff very welcoming.  Our servers name was Amy and was an A+.  The manager, Rick was always checking tables and really seems to care.  So glad they have a Grimaldi's here!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my husbands birthday here. Great staff, food and service.. great night and memories. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Great casual pizza spot! Came here as we are visiting from out of town and wanted a casual dinner spot. I like that their menu is simple, and pizzas are all personal!  Ordered the Mediterranean and spinach salad (large) as apps for the 7 people table. It was definitely enough and both were good however the spinach seemed to be the favorite. Note the waiter (josh I believe was his name) allowed us to substitute the bacon for crotons, which is always very nice!   For dinner we had two large pizza, one red sauce with olives, green bell pepper, onions and fresh garlic--this was definitely the favorite for the majority of us! The red sauce and garlic mixture was perfect!  The other one was a pesto with mushroom and artichokes, good as well.  Both pizzas were well cooked and not soggy, and the waiter was very ontop of our drink refills along with apologizing the delay (took about 40-45 minutes but it was a full house!   Last I loved that our reservations were at 7pm and when  we got there at exactly 7 and they sat us down immediately--now that's what I call fulfilling your reservations! I love when places can do that!   Only downside was the tables seemed pretty squeezed together and with tall family members, it was hard to push our seats back to stretch our legs as we were right by the kitchen:/"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza spot. The salads are large enough to share, the pizza crust is thin crust and perfect to be able to enjoy the rest of the pizza no matter what toppings you decide on.  We don't particularly enjoy getting so full on pizza dough itself when it's so thick!  We usually get the pepperoni and italian sausage with half ricotta (Love the taste and texture here) and fresh basil after it comes out of the oven.  For 2 of us, a small is actually perfect size because there is room for dessert.  Haven't tried all of them, but the desserts we have had were also yummy.  Our regular go to place for pizza.  Wish they had a location near Aliante! We've done takeout, but best if you can eat it right when it comes out of the oven fresh. The staff is constantly re-filling our drinks and courteous."}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent. Topping are fresh. Service is absolutely the best. We always are luck to get Jilani who takes care of us. He's the best."}
{"text":"This is my all-time favorite pizza place.  Pizza is my favorite food and I love the wonderful creative culinary directions that pizza has gone, but this is true blue pizza done very well.  Great atmosphere.  Love the sit down pizza atmosphere. Portions of caesar salad and caprese are generous and consistently delicious.  Consistency is the key for any pizza place and Grimaldi's hits the mark everytime."}
{"text":"We've been here three times now and love it! The food and drinks are consistently yummy! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Live the pizza and salad that all my girlfriend and I order love the people as well that work there I just wish the table cloths were clean but other than that place is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service Monique! Thanks for making my date night out with my 7 yr old a success. Pizza was cooked to perfection and fast! Monique was friendly and engaging with my son. Thanks Grimmaldis! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be our go to place for pizza. The last few times we've been there the wait was misquoted and half the restaurant was empty. We won't be back due to the extremely long waits and the obvious mismanagement in regards to staffing. If you want to spend your evening waiting out front this is your place."}
{"text":"I've been down to the Grimaldi's in Tucson, which was much better but still a tad overrated. This one, though, was not good at all. It was lunch on a weekday (i.e, not busy at all with maybe 10% of the tables occupied), but our pizza took more than 30 minutes to come out, and our server was slow and unattentive. When the pizza finally came, the crust was soggy  (so much for \"coal-fired pizza) and there just wasn't much flavor. With drinks and the (undeserved) tip, the final bill was over $40, which is pretty steep for a subpar meal."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever. I had a personal calzone and a personal white pizza, decent price with fantastic taste. I had them with the money I won from slot machine, which might brought me even better experience. I loved here definitely."}
{"text":"First time at Grimaldis. I had a calzone with pepperoni, meatballs, and onions. Not only was this the best calzone I have ever had, it was the best Italian food I have ever put in my mouth. Don't hesitate, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Not sure why people stand in line to get in this place. I arrived early & still waited 1 hour & 15 min. for a small pepperoni & kalamata olive pizza & salad.  The salad had 2 olives, a few pieces of red pepper & a bowl full of romaine lettuce.  You had to pay extra for the pepperoni & kalamata olive which would have been ok but each slice had 2-3 small pepperoni's & 2 pieces of olives.  People were waiting to get in & they had several empty tables & lots of staff hanging around as 1 pizza at a time seemed to come out of the oven.  I should have never missed an early evening at Oregano's for this.  My 1st trip to Grimaldi's will be my last!"}
{"text":"I love this new location and i am so glad Grimaldi's decided to open one on my side of town.  The first time I a taste of heavenly pizza was down at the Eastern location and when this one opened in Summerlin I was ecstatic!  As you can see I am a regular at Grimaldi's and these are just a few must haves when you are there!  1. The pesto pizza is to die for, alongside the white.  I usually get a half and half just so i can get the best of both worlds. 2. My Favorite toppings are: Sausage, ricotta cheese, pepperonis, onions, extra garlic, roasted peppers, and maybe some basil.  (these are just a few of my favs that i think are their specialties that is a must, however, all other toppings are very good as well) 3. Their Greek or Mediterranean salads are amazing!  light and refreshing, not over the top heavy creamy dressing which is very nice right before a hearty meal. 4. they have half off bottle wines some nights or some times so it's always smart to ask the waitresses what their specials are in case you are looking for a good time!  Friendly tip:  if you can't decide on the size of pizza, always go with large because you can never go wrong with leftover grimaldi's for a midnight snack or next day breakfast. if more than 2 people, get two large with different toppings and get creative!  i don't think you can go wrong either way!  don't get scared away by the wait, there's a total wines and shops in this plaza so even if the wait is 30 mins, you can easily kill time in the plaza without going too far."}
{"text":"If anything could make me doubt chicago pizza being the best this would be it.  Thin crust, but wow!  Really fresh, and really good.  You're not going to find better pizza.  The sangria was great too.  Plus for vegas it was really inexpensive.  If I go back to vegas I'm going back for sure."}
{"text":"We had the margarita and pepperoni pizza. Their pepperoni grease made one pizza edible, the other was horrible. The crust on both was tasteless and even though both had red sauce, they were so overcooked that the sauce could be seen, but not tasted. Not worth the trip. The 6 of us put it on par with tostino's."}
{"text":"I mean.. This pizza wasn't really all that. I would rather have Pizza from Costco. It's cheaper and tastes way better than Grimaldi's. Not to mention, the tables are WAY too small to hold a pizza if you're going with family. The tables probably would only fit two to three people at most with one single pizza. The sauce doesn't really taste like anything, almost as if it's been watered down. The cheese is a little bit rubbery on the pizza, too; not to mention, this is probably one of the most expensive pizzerias out here. The staff also never really listened. I understand that it may be busy, but when you're shouting over your customers and can't even hear a simple drink order, that's when it kind of gets a little uncomfortable. Most of the staff don't even seem like they want to be there.  2/5 would not eat here again."}
{"text":"This was arguably my favorite part of my first Vegas visit.  My fiancee and I split a bottle of wine and a medium pie on a late night date.  My half was sausage and onion and hers just had onion as a topping.  The pizza was crisp in all the right places, without creating a bunch of crumbs when you took a bite, and soft in all the right places, without being chewy.  All the ingredients jumped out and were tasty.  What really made the experience was the service.  Granted, it was fairly late at night (is there such a thing as \"late\" in Vegas?) but the server was very attentive, kept our waters filled, made sure to check on us, and generally came across as a nice guy.  This was all made more impressive by the fact that he was also working the bar at the same time.  Another great part about the dining experience here is that it's fairly cheap dining.  The bottle of wine and medium pizza came in under $40 and a medium is definitely enough for 2 people, in case you were wondering."}
{"text":"This might be the best pizza I have ever eaten: traditional crust with sun-dried tomatoes and pesto.  Crunchy thin crust, top-notch ingredients, delicious flavor... Perfect with a Peroni beer!  Right off of old-town Scottsdale and within walking distance of some of the best art in Arizona, this is a perfect place to have an excellent pizza.  Kid-friendly too!"}
{"text":"As usual best pizza around....the flavors come thru on every bite...service was good as usual and there is always attention to detail.....if you haven't been, do yourself a favor and treat yourself, you won't be disappointed, you will find yourself going back., great way to empress your friends from out of town for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in for a pizza later on in the night and sat at the bar on the 17th. Once we sat down we put our order in with the bartender. The bartender asked us if it was the first time we had been there, which it was. We were pretty hungry so we ordered a salad to hold us off until the pizza got out to us. We also ordered extra sauce for our pizza. A little over an hour later, we receive our pizza and never even got our salad. When we asked about our salad he just replied with, \"sorry, I forgot.\" He also forgot the extra sauce that we ordered with our pizza. Overall, the pizza was okay at best. It tasted pretty dry, as though it had been sitting for sometime before actually coming out to us. Due to the poor service and mediocre pizza, I don't think we will be eating at Grimaldi's again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza, but Ill Bosco in Scottsdale is much better"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Grimaldis before catching a movie.  Pizza was excellent and the toppings were obviously fresh and of the highest quality.  Wine is reasonably priced, though the server did not have much knowledge of the selection.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hey Yall.....I AM FAN if I wasn't before....1st off ask for GREG he totally rocks...This is the 1st pizza that DID NOT require me adding PARMESAN to it. I ordered a size half and half....One side was the specialty ROSEMARY POTATO PIZZA it included gorgonzola cheese.....ummmmm on my HOMER SIMPSON VOICE....The other side was my OLD FAITHFUL for all pizza pepperoni and sausage....oooo weeeeee...The sauce is tangy...The Pepperoni is awesome with a slight snap and the Italian Sausage is flavorful with a nice spice kick....i do see what one person said about the red sauce being thin but I like it that way if I wanted a lot of sauce I would have asked or got breadsticks from the hut...ijs...oh and crust is what brick oven pizza is all about...henceforth the name BRICK OVEN,  not BURNT OVEN....i am even more excited that we have one of these joints in Dallas. CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS A+++, the manager even swung by to chat it up a bit. Total Awesome Sauce."}
{"text":"Went there for my free 18\" birthday pizza (coupon) on a Monday a little after 3:30 pm. I was told they were doing some kind of maintenance on the oven and it would take an hour to complete, then another 20 or so minutes to get a pizza. Something they did everyday. I asked if they could substitute another item they said no. Coupon expired the next day so the hell with Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Hey Grimaldi.  How about some sauce?   Last 3 times in we've ordered extra sauce and if there were 3 tablespoons on a large I'd be surprised.  One more chance just because \"most\" of your people and ingredients are great.  Remember, people, product and service.  Not sure where sauce falls, but ...  Otherwise save your money and pick up a Red Barron."}
{"text":"First time coming here. The food was amazing and was only surpassed by the customer service. Thanks Kristen for making our experience special and treating us so well. Definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"So very very good!!! Brooklyn bridge pizza was done perfectly. Atmosphere is fun and romantic. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's for pizza.got the large one topping with Spicy Chicken sausage and it was delicious. It was worth the trip & service was quick & helpful.  If you want a really good pizza & like spicy. This pizza is for you."}
{"text":"I heard this pizzeria was #2 in the country. I'll say this:  I would be disappointed if I had paid $5 for this 'pizza'. Horrible. Horrible. Very little cheese, little toppings..... JUST NOT GOOD AT ALL.  I am a fan of thin, crispy pizza (Villa, La Familia, etc), but this was not good, and I have no doubt I will never go back."}
{"text":"Pizza was fantastic! We got a large Pepperoni, Meatball, Sausage, Mushroom, and Olive pizza and it was some of the best New York style pizza I have had. The large was just enough to fill us up. Another group at our table got a different pizza and it was watery and cheese was really gooey, so it might be hit or miss. Service was good. Our waiter came over to our table just enough times to get us a couple refills and our check. Our hostess was very nice and kept checking in on us, asking if we wanted drinks or to look at a menu, while we were waiting for our table to be ready. For a large pizza and 5 beers we paid $50, so it was a little pricey, but not to bad."}
{"text":"My co worker picked up pizza and salad from this place a few days ago for our office.  She said this place had the best pizza ever.  She brought the yumminess through our office.  The smell of pizza filled the air. YAY finally food!!!!!!..  *BOOM*...First BITE............you know that feeling of when you know its right, ITS RIGHT, man that first bite was......  OMGGGGGGGGGG SOOOO Delicious!!  I am definitely headed back to this place. The food is a whole bunch of yumminess!!!"}
{"text":"Aaaaaaaaye Grimaldi! You like real pizza? Youll love this lil' traditional joint also in Old Town Scottsdale.  Sauce? Bomb. Crust? Bomb! If you don't like it you're probably from Sun Valley, NV or Apache Junction, AZ."}
{"text":"Hands down the best thin crust pizza I've ever had so far!!! For me it beats settebello and stepped it up a notch. I only gave it a 4 stars because we went it for lunch time and it wasnt slammed or anything but our pizza took a while. Our server was great and the pizza was fantastic just a little slow on the pizza.   We ordered the small white pie with grimaldis sauce, jalepenos, mushrooms and bacon. I loved it!  Definitely my new favorite pizza place to go to and the atmosphere here is great! Theres also other things to do around the corner.  Keep it up! Love your pizza."}
{"text":"SO Good! The staff here are also extremely friendly and if you are a regular like my family, they learn who you are and treat you like family. You must run and get their Mediterranean salad and a classic pepperoni pie. If you save room for dessert or even not, the tiramisu is like none other. I take all of my out of town guests here. the DC Ranch area is also so pretty, and not bad romantic -wise for a date even with this being a pizza place."}
{"text":"Great food/drinks ~ Great atmosphere ~ GREAT Staff!  The Brooklyn Bridge pizza was recommended by our waiter, Elmer, which is outstanding and highly recommended. Elmer was full of life, positive energy, fun and personable. Erick, the manager approached my boyfriend and I and was very professional, entertaining and kind. The staff and food made the night very enjoyable and a night to remember. As natives of Las Vegas we all know the staff and food make the experience worth returning for! Fun good times! Exceptional service! Thank you S. Rainbow Grimaldi's! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"First time here, we ordered ceasar salad and pizza w/garlic, olives & mushroom.  My husband likes food with strong flavors and I'm the opposite... So for both of us to like the ceasar salad means it was just right.  I liked the croutons on the salad, it was crunchy with some seasonings but not too hard.  Pizza was good, simple fresh ingredients and the crust was cooked just right.  Mike our server was very attentive to our needs.  We will visit here again."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday night about half way through the Sunday Night Football game.  The place was pretty packed but there were two seats at the end of the bar.  The bartender Rochelle was awesome.  Very friendly, kept our drinks coming. explained the entire menu to me (was my first time there) and was very warm and let us joke around with her as well.  Food was great.  Not quite the Brick Oven style that I am used to coming from Hawaii.  The only downfall was no bacon.  Every pizza place should have a bacon option."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've had in Arizona since moving here ten years ago. Where's the second best? Fugetaboutit, it doesn't matter, Grimaldi's has ruined all other pies for me.  It's not cheap but you cannot beat the crispy thin crust or real deal mozzarella cheese, this ain't no bag of shredded cheese on your pizza, it's the good stuff. Our favorite is a caprese style pie where the basil is added after cooking. Try it, you'll like it. Another plus is the fact they have sliced meatball topping, not ground beef. They make the balls, cook them, cool and slice. That's the only way to put beef on a pizza pie.  It doesn't matter which location you go to, the quality of service and food is tops in San Tan, Chandler, Scottsdale or Peoria. I cannot say enough good things about Grimaldi's"}
{"text":"This place has great Pizza.  After buying it here for years I won't be back.  I waited 10 minutes to place a to go order only to be passed up for the bartenders friends.  Maybe you have to know someone here to get good service.  I will not go back to this place.  There is a much better one in Gilbert and Scottsdale.  Same great food, better service."}
{"text":"I got take out this time.  Ray was our take out person/bartender. Really nice guy, very helpful and didn't rush us.  We got a Grimaldi house salad and large white with fresh basil and tomatoes, which was the good quality I come to expect."}
{"text":"This Vegas location is HORRIBLE! Pizza was over cooked & Staff was rude. Spoke to the Manager on Duty, Steve (who happens to be the the General Manager of the location), which resulted in Zero action taken to accommodate our visit.   We all know how important service is for visitors to our city, why not give the same courtesy to locals, who continue to give you business, even during the slow times."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this pizza. We loved our waitress Lainey, who comes from NY. This is the best brick oven pizza I've had in phoenix. A little on the pricey side, but worth it...they give kids pizza dough to play with which kept my 2yo daughter entertained... Will be back for more"}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn years ago; decided to try it again in Vegas. The Brooklyn pie was much better, thinner crust and richer tomato sauce. The pizza was good, just not as good as the original. Had the UGO cocktail which was really refreshing and balanced."}
{"text":"I've been so curious of this place. Ive done many Postmates pickups. Today was the first day I tried Grimaldi's Pizzeria at Boca Park. No wait at all for Saturday at 4pm. We ordered a Mediterranean salad with a 18 inch pizza with extra pepperoni, extra mozzarella, and basil. This made me think of pizza on a whole other level and I've had Giordano's earlier this year and this is AMAZING. I'd highly recommend the place. Michael was our waiter and is very nice warm welcoming. Michael made sure we had everything. What's even more awesome is kids get to play with pizza dough"}
{"text":"I have had dinner at this restaurant several times and did not find it particularly noteworthy. The pizza is not far above average, and the salads are pretty bland and common. I also do not find the service anywhere above ordinary. The atmosphere is pleasant and and it is near my home, so I continue to go there."}
{"text":"Had to leave Grimaldi's because they had \"to change their coals\" & could only offer salads & appetizers. The wait for pizza would have been over an hour... Oh well -- sorry Grimaldi's you lost customers today & next time I won't think of you because if I'm hungry for pizza, you're ovens might not be working because you're \"changing your coals\".  This is a pizza place, right?"}
{"text":"For some reason I wasn't sure I wanted to try this place, but it all worked out. Grimadi's is in a great location in old town Scottsdale, right around the corner from a million little art galleries and boutique shops. It's a beautiful area to stroll around in before and after dinner - but if shopping is one of your objectives, make it before dinner, the streets seem to roll up by 7pm.  Anyway, back to the pizzeria. Grimaldi's had a pretty good sized dining room with tables that sit just a hair to close together for my taste. The crowd is lively and boisterous - everyone seemed to be having a really good time gabbing over their New York style pie (so much so that maybe this wouldn't be the best place to go with your hearing impared mother). The menu is simple. It's a few salads, pizza or calzones. That's it. If you don't want pizza, get out.  The pies are BIG. A personal pizza is still 12 whopping inches and no one in our group was able to finish one - this is a place where the to go box is almost a given. The crust is thin, the toppings plentiful and the sauce a bit sweet. I opted for a calzone which comes standard with fresh mozarella and ricotta cheese and to that I added Italian sausage and jalepanos (I love me some spicy peppers!).  If ricotta isn't your bag baby, just have them leave that out. It does add a bit of creaminess to the overall cheese texture (which is plentiful) but that didn't bother me and I thouht it went great with the sausage and peppers. I ate 2 of the 4 sections the calzone was cut up into and I probably could have stopped at 1. This place is for sharing, that's what I'd say. Thumbs up on the calzone for its well done crust and fresh fillers - I'd get this again.  We got the small house salad with Romaine, red onion, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms and green olives in the house vinaigrette. Awesome and the small is enough to feed 3 people as a starter.  The staff is helpful and efficient. The decor is simple and homey - red checkered tablecloths just say pizza if you ask me. They have a wine list that's pretty extensive and the bottles seem reasonably priced (and they can cork any bottle you don't finish and you can take it with you).While I can't say its the absolute best pizza I've ever had, Grimaldi's is simply a fun place to eat and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday with about 12 people and we enjoyed out first experience at Grimaldi's. We had about 4-5 large pizzas and had a lil leftover to take home but boy was that the best pizza I have ever had!! A lil bit hard to find but this is my new favorite pizza place! :)"}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever eaten! The service was excellent! Being a vegas restaurant in a 5 star hotel the prices were also reasonable.  Will be going back on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Reminiscent of the actual Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.  Good pizza, friendly service.  I wish it were slightly more affordable, but otherwise, worth missing my flight for."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall, but tucked away enough that the outdoor tables are a pleasant place to sit. The pizzas are very thin crust, cooked in a 1000 degree coal-fired oven. They are nicely charred and used good ingredients. I had fresh garlic and sausage on mine. Sausage was good with a nice fennel taste. Sauce may have been a touch on the sweet side, but not really objectionable. It's in Henderson and feels a world away from the Strip, so it is a good place to take a break from the glitz."}
{"text":"It's not quite the same as the one in NY but it's very good. You definitely should try the reg pizza with pesto and pepperoni. I'm not a huge fan of pesto but this combo works extremely well."}
{"text":"Salad was awesome but we had to have pizza made twice and there still was no sauce on the pizza.  For the price charged the pizza should be perfect - everytime."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza and customization. Cesar salad kicked ass!"}
{"text":"Despite the \"roach situation\" I finally gave this one a try. It was very good, not great. Typically the first time I try a pizza joint I go with just straight pepperoni, this time was no exception. I always feel that if a place can get the basics right then I am willing to venture out and try something a little more.... exotic.  The crust was good, the cheese very good, not much in the way of sauce. Worth trying however I still prefer chicago style pizza. If it is't cut in squares, it isn't pizza:)"}
{"text":"If you love pizza you will love this place. I was lucky enough to have this place around in Arizona and now they are in Vegas. Cheesecake is the best. Pizza is thin crust perfection. Must come and try"}
{"text":"First time at Grimaldi's... Great experience!!  We had a 30min wait on a Friday night but it was definitely worth it. Kim was our server and she was hilarious! She kept us laughing the whole time. Not to mention her service was exceptional. There was an error on our order and she quickly addressed it. Pizza and salad was delish. Request Kim at Peoria location and you'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"\"We don't sell pizza or calzones until after 5pm\"  Me: \"isn't that all you sell\"?  \"We have salads\"  So let me get this straight you sell only pizza, calzones and salad but I can only get salad?  Why are you even open before 5?"}
{"text":"Been here a million times. Can't believe I haven't given them a plug before!!! Best pizza place hands down. Loved it when Makenna was our waitress. She's so good they moved her to management! Go Mackenna!"}
{"text":"My first Grimaldi's experience was about 7 or 8 years ago, at the first Las Vegas location on Eastern. We would drove over there just for Grimaldi's or find a reason to go to Trader Joe's and then happen to pass by Grimaldi's.   From the First Bite on Day One, it was the intrigue of the soft creamy mounds ricotta as a topping that hooked me! I had already tasted some of the great New York pies, I.e., Patsy's, Totonno's and some of the emerging California greats such as Delphina in San Francisco.   Grimaldi's arrival elevated the then lackluster, subpar pizza scene in Las Vegas. Though I would gladly take a bite or more from a pizza from Mozza (LA), John's (NY) or Chez Panisse (Berkeley,  CA) any day,  having Grimaldi's nearby on Rainbow is a comforting thought!   With curbside pickup, Grimaldi's on Rainbow can't be beat! Tonight's spicy chicken sausage provided a nice kick and counter part to the standard ricotta. Yum!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, I got the white with garlic and loved it. Their cannoli was not the best, but the amaretto cheesecake was to die for- get it while it lasts! I went with a large group and the wait staff was very accommodating and helped us split our checks most efficiently. Very cute New York themed place, and reasonable prices for the amount of pizza. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas- I know that's not saying much but it actually is delicious. The  crust is crispy, New-York style and yummy while the topping selection is wonderful. They also have peroni beer on draft and fresh, very large salads. The pizzas are expensive if you ad more than 2 toppings but it's actually worth it because each topping is high quality and flavorful. This is a great choice for date night."}
{"text":"I had previously eaten many times at the main location (4000 N Scottsdale) and also DC Ranch so I knew what to expect and believe me, this new addition to the Grimaldi's expanding empire definitely lives up to their very high standards.  Grimaldi's has locations in several states now --- GO GRIMALDI'S!!!  :))  Thin crust is wonderful!  My personal favorite is with fresh mozz and fresh basil.  Keeping it simple.  I have tried many of their other toppings though and they were also wonderful (even the anchovies, which I usually don't like but for some reason I really *do* like the ones that Grimaldi's uses!).  Service is always courteous, prompt, friendly, and if you have been there more than a few times they will remember your face and name (or is that just me? Hahaha! Kidding!).  I personally think that this pizza is good enough to take on Chicago pizzerias and have told Grimaldi's corporate this.  Coal oven brick pizza, recreation of the local water in Brooklyn in order to obtain the crust texture, crispness, etc. with fresh ingredients and each pizza is made to order.  The care that they put into each pizza shows.  Oh---they've opened up Coal Burger too!  I haven't tried that yet.  Will need to do so!  Will definitely keep you posted on that!"}
{"text":"We went, on the last night of our Las Vegas sojourn, to Grimaldi's as we both fancied pizza and salad.  Grimaldi's seemed to be a decent place so we decided to check it out. We were sorely disappointed. so many things were not quite right at Grimaldi's. Number one for me was that they put tomato sauce on their Marguerita pizza. I would have had that pizza but for that. Anyone who knows pizza knows that that is a no-no on a Marguerita. Second, coal-fired ovens? It might be cheaper to run coal-fired ovens but a wood-fired oven imparts a far better flavour into the pizza. Onto the food itself. I ordered a white 12\" pizza with anchovies and black olives, my wife, one of their 12\" garden pizzas. To top them off we ordered a bowl of salad to share. The salad came out first and it was nice and fresh, had a nice vinaigrette dressing and a few additions. Could have done with a bit more of the additions, they were a bit sparse. The pizzas arrived and they were crispy on the edges and a bit doughy in the middle. Probably could have done with another 30 seconds or so in the oven. My pizza was okay but nothing to write home about, I could find probably get as good a pizza in my local Dominos (if not better on a good night!). My wife's pizza was not good at all. She had to sprinkle both parmesan (which she said was an inferior type of) and salt on the pizza to get any flavour out of it and said that the toppings were extremely bland and lacked any flavour at all. I had a cocktail which was nice but with an overall bill of just over 60 bucks for two pizzas, a salad and a drink we were most underwhelmed by the experience. We will not be visiting Grimaldis again and were most unimpressed with their items. Thank you."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews and I'm so glad I did. The pizza I had here was my top favorite meal I had in Las Vegas! The best. The service was excellent and the pizza was delicious. It's located in a nice quieter area in Vegas which is nice. This place is a must when in Vegas."}
{"text":"The GM is the rudest lady! Set up a party over the phone. I then made an appointment to meet her closer to the date and go over the menu. And she completely changed EVERYTHING. Lied about it all. Needless to say I went to a different restaurant for my party of 30! I have been told by a lot of people how HORRIBLE she is and now I believe it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live in Washington, DC and visited Scottsdale for a winter getaway over New Year's Weekend. We love food and restaurants  and make a point to seek out the best sushi, Mexican food and pizza when we travel.  After much research we selected Patsy Grimaldi's for pizza and could not have been more pleased with quality of the food and the service.  The menu is simple, featuring salads, calzones and pizza.    We ordered the Mediterranean salad which was delicious - and that is not a word I use often in reference to salads.  The salad had fresh romaine lettuce, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers, feta cheese, a few red onions and uber flavorful kalamata olives.  The salad was chopped to perfection and pre-tossed with a light dressing.   And then there was the pizza.  There are three pizza \"bases\" to chose from - mozzarella/tomato, white pizza, or pesto - and then you can select your own toppings.  We selected the tomato and mozzarella base with pepperoni and jalapeno peppers.  The mozzarella was not shredded and loaded all over the pizza.  It was fresh mozzarella placed sparingly all over the crust so every bite had some cheese, but it did not overwhelm the pie.  The sauce was made from homemade crushed tomato sauce with just the right seasoning.  The crust was thick and tasty and cooked evenly.  The toppings added some extra flavor, although we would have enjoyed the pizza without them.   This was hands down one of the top three pizzas I have ever eaten and I have eaten a lot of pizza.    I was surprised to see so many reviews mention Grimaldi's as \"overpriced.\"  Our meal - salad, pizza and two beers was $36 after tax.  For a yummy dinner for two I don't know how you can do much better than that.  I can only guess that the folks moaning and groaning about the price of the pizza chose to top their pizza with 4-5 of the more expensive ingredients that pushed the price of the pizza into an uncomfortable range.  Just be selective with your toppings and you will find Grimaldi's to be an excellent value.  One last note - we did wait for about 35 minutes for a table, which was fine.  We went on a Saturday night.  We had a very friendly server and we were pleasently surprised when we told her we wanted a salad and a pizza but didn't know what size to order.  (My husband wanted both large's.... I thought we'd need a large salad and small pizza.)  Our server told us to order a small pizza and small salad and she was right.  It was more than enough food. She could have nudged us in a different direction and we would have spent more money, but the fact that she was honest about the portions was much appreciated.  Run, don't walk to Grimaldi's next time you are looking for pizza in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I ever had.Im from Chicago. Chicago style is for tourists. I like thin crust. I wish I could get this back home. I loved this pizza"}
{"text":"I am a fan. L does not love it as much. I think I bring the pizza home to warm for her tastes."}
{"text":"service  supreme, pizza served  promptly with  gusto.  excellent  wine.  over  all  a very  pleasant  experience."}
{"text":"The staff here is so chill. The hostess to the bartender are awesome. The prices here are what you might expect from Vegas, although compared to the other restaurants around this particular location (between the Venetian and Palazzo), Grimaldi's is cheaper.   As others have said, the \"small\" size pizza here is equivalent to a medium pizza from your chain stores. I wouldn't say that it is enough for two people, because I ate a whole small pie by myself. But I will say that it is a very filling portion.   It's not the absolute best pizza I have had.. but it is a decent pizza, and it was a nice change of pace from the higher-end restaurants."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's makes me realize it's worth it to pay more for real pizza (instead of the $5 deals). Their pricing is reasonable and you get your money's worth in flavor and ingredients. The Gilbert location is lively and popular. I greatly appreciated the friendly greeting at the front and the gracious hospitality from John (manager?)"}
{"text":"Love the pizza but to wait an hour for the pizza to come out after you order is ridiculous. The manager apologized and the server didn't know at the time we ordered but I have to believe they lost our order and only after saying something 40 minutes later that we got our pizza 20 minutes after I said something. They comped the pizza but still very disappointing experience and I won't be going back to that location"}
{"text":"This was my third visit. The ovens weren't on the first two. It happens every day after lunch. They come on just before dinner. So don't come at 3 and expect a pizza. Everything else on the menu is available. We shared a small Caesar salad. Large enough portion for two hungry people!  We ordered the white pizza. It was very good but on the bland side. Nothing really fantastic about the flavor. I wouldn't be back for that pizza.  I had a red Sangria. It was delicious. Had a wonderful flavor and a generous portion.  Come for the Sangria but maybe try a red sauced pizza if you do!"}
{"text":"The pizza took about 40 minutes to come out, but it was great NY sttle pizza. I recommend The Don which was the hands down favorite of our group of 14.  The only qualm I have is that they automatically added 20% gratuity to our bill, which is kinda shady."}
{"text":"I've been to other Gramaldi's locations before and been very pleased; at this location I was disappointed. All of the staff were friendly, but he food was sub par. I first ordered an antipasto salad-which wasn't a salad at all. It came out as a meat and cheese plate w/ some bread. There were four slices of salami and four slices of mozzarella cheese with some olives and marinated red pepper.   After, I ordered a white garlic pizza w/ spinach, Italian sausage, black olives & basil. It looked great when it came out but it had zero flavor. I'm not sure if the white garlic sauce was even on the pizza.   To make matters worse the bathroom had no paper towels, so I had to use toilet paper to dry my hands."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. They use high quality ingredients. Awesome customer service and wait is minimum. If in town you have to visit this place. Highly recommend, as good as it gets:)"}
{"text":"People screw up pizza a LOT. Seriously, I just don't think anyone even realizes how many ways people get it wrong. As the stars probably gave away, I feel Grimaldi's is different.   The ingredients are fresh and put on the pizzas in that wonderful sweet spot of being plentiful but not overcrowded. The sauce isn't drowning everything, nor is it barely there. The crust is thin, crispy and actually manages to not be either overpowering or taste like lifeless cardboard.   Let me put this another way. A lot of people in this city claim to have New York style pizza. Grimaldi's actually does. Not only that, but the interior makes it plainly obvious that whoever designed it has actually been to the east coast at some point, unlike most places that overdo it and try to shove east coast culture down your throat in the design in order to make you think that's what it looks like.   Sorry...I'm a Jersey native. It drives me nuts the way so many restaurants get it all wrong, be it food or design or usually both. Grimaldi's makes me actually think of home and the little pizza restaurants you'd find there. It looks like it, it tastes like it. If you want GOOD New York style pizza, go here. It's pretty much that simple."}
{"text":"This place had amazing pizza that's similar to they York pizza. They also have great service"}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious!  Even better than that which we ate on our Italian vacation last summer. Perfect crust and sauce!"}
{"text":"I grew up in phoenix where there have been Grimaldi's pizza for awhile, so when i heard they were coming to Las Vegas I was stoked. The pizza is the best, the service is a little slow but more than worth it, and they are very nice so all is well. A bit on the expensive side too, 18 bucks for a large pizza is no joke, but ill be damned if the price isn't worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places!  We eat here on a semi-regular basis because it is, as far as I'm concerned, the best pizza place in the Ahwatukee area. (All the locations are excellent, this is just the closest to home.)  We order the same thing every time because it's pretty much perfect - White with Garlic pizza, extra cheese, mushrooms, and pepperoni.  The flavor is wonderful and the texture is a great combination of melty soft cheese and crispy, wood-fired crust.  Each component part is good enough to eat on it's own - spicy pepperoni, creamy cheese, fresh mushrooms, and a slightly salty crust.  HIGHLY recommended.  We've had a couple of their salads before - the Mediterranean and the Caesar.  Both had fresh with flavorful dressings.  The Caesar was my favorite of the two - tangy and bright tasting, with a nice Parmesan cheese on top.  BTW, even the small size salads are large enough to share between four people.  The only issue we've ever had was with the service when this location first opened.  All subsequent trips have been wonderful.  The staff is friendly and the decor is very nice.  It's a little on the spendy side, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner and it was great as always. The pizza here is so good and one of the closest to thin crust NY style I have found here. The service was ok, very slow considering the restaurant was not at all busy yet. The cheesecake was so so, not the best I have had. Overal for Pizza I love this place."}
{"text":"This place deserves all the stars.  If you want to come here on a Friday for dinner, come early, parking lot gets full.  I have been to other Grimaldi's, but this place is just where I feel comfortable.  As for the pizza, it is the best compared to the rest in the city.  White pizza with garlic with artichokes.  Anchovies goes great on the regular pizza."}
{"text":"After all of the reviews, we expected more. When we brought \"The Don\" home we were shocked at what was not on the pizza. Thin, thin, thin crust, burnt on the bottom, sauce?Cheese?Where?...a scattering of tiny pepperonis, the same with tiny meatballs...unbelievable. Oh..I forgot the three pieces of burnt basil. To name this\"The Don\"?...We had people over for the game... I had to pop popcorn and pull out leftovers."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Grimaldi's for quite a few years and we have always had a good dining experience.  We know that they stoke the ovens between 4-5 and know there can be quite a wait. We don't mind waiting the time to get good quality pizza. The reason I am only giving it three stars after this visit is because of the staff.  Especially the host Francisco.  He is rude!  He speaks in a condescending tone.  Especially if you have parties larger then 4. He acts annoyed.  During my 45 minute wait for a table I watched people that wanted tables that had larger parties be spoken in a tone and manner that was not respectful.  Love your pizza but please come up with a better system for parties over 4 and by all means please coach your lead host on how to deal with people."}
{"text":"This place has some tasty pizza but they are very pricey for cheese and dough! Being from Chicago it's hard for me to spend $50 on 2 pizzas but that's just me. Great place for celebrating an occasion once a year but too pricey for my taste buds. Good pizza!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here with family. The staff was really nice. We arrived shortly before closing. However we were never rushed. We had Quattro Formaggi and margherita. Both tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"I just came here for the first time with a friend from out of state. Let me start with the phenomenal server we had, Brice. He was so friendly and funny he made our first time dining a great experience. The pizza we got was top of the line as well. It took me too long to check this place out and will quickly be returning."}
{"text":"The Don hit the spot. Crispy crust gives this pizza what it needed to hit the five star."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm...why did I wait so long to try this????  Unbelievable pizza!!!!!!!!!!  I would give 5 stars, bjt the service was...well, not great.  Its ok, we all have off days.  We'll be back!!!!"}
{"text":"I think this very nice and well clean place the service is pretty well kept up I suggest coming to this food establishment"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a slice of some thin crust New York style pizza. Nice coal brick oven pizza with fresh mozzarella and spicy sausage. Thge service was outstanding, and the atmosphere was reminiscent of the Rat Pack. Nice lunch date!"}
{"text":"This place makes fabulous pizza. I could just end there, but I won't.  First off, they know how to style a restaurant. It's got that  chic Chicago-vibe with the brick walls and antique yet trendy décor. The place was a little packed when we went Friday night, and the tables are placed close so it's definitely cozy but you don't really notice. What's really cool is if you're seated in the front you can see the boys flipping the dough and making pizzas, taking them in and out of the brick oven. It's entertaining.  Our waitress was super nice. Almost too nice, although I'm not complain about that considering I'd take an overly-helpful waitress over a spaced-out anti-social one any day (bad experience in the past.) The other employees were also friendly and approachable.   Ok, the food itself is amazing. Mostly the pizza. They do a thin-crusted pizza cooked in a brick oven, and that within itself is drool-worthy. We got a regular one with sausage and a white pizza with chicken and olives. The white pizza went first, but both were awesome. I ended with an order of Tiramisu and loved every bite. They even do seasonal cheesecakes that I haven't tried yet but am looking forward to the day that I can.  Fair-Warning: This place is a little pricey. Don't expect your $5 Little Caesar's Hot 'n' Ready price. It is worth it though.  Tip: If you sign up for their club ahead of time, on your birthday you get a coupon for a free large pizza. What's not to love about that?"}
{"text":"Loved it!  I was so disappointed when I wasn't able to try Grimaldi's when I was out in NY, and pleasantly surprised to learn that there was one right in Vegas!  It's a bit far off the strip (closer to South Point), but I think it's worth the drive.  This NY style pizzeria is delish.  The crust was thin and crispy, just the way I like it!  And they offer a red AND a white (garlic) sauce; I think both are definitely worth a taste.  Their salads were OK, but a good combination with the pizza.  Great service, great prices, great food.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We usually go to the Grimaldi's at the Scottsdale Quarter but went to this location since we were shopping nearby.  While we usually enjoy going to Grimaldi's, the service at this location was horrible.  First, we wait at the front desk for five minutes before the gentleman even acknowledges us.  While I understand he may have been busy, a simple acknowledgement that he would be right with us would have been nice.  Next, after we got seated, we sat at the table for over 15 minutes.  During this time, no server ever approached our table even though there were numerous servers at the restaurant and the restaurant was only abut half full.  We decided to leave and when we left I informed the person at the front desk that we were leaving since no server ever came to our table.  He didn't didn't seem to care.  I will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!    Very good.   Wow, calzone personal can feed two.   :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I usually keep it simple with a cheese and basil pizza.  The cheese is quality fresh mozzarella.  The sauce is light yet flavorful.  The dough is paper thin but has a nice texture and flavor due to the coal oven.  IMO, other toppings tend to overpower and take away from the pizza.  If you like New York pizza, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I 5 star this place strictly for their garlic white sauce pizza, which is hands down the best in town. Add pepperoni, bell peppers, onion, additional garlic, and tomatoes, and that my friends is the recipe for best pizza in town. Id recommend all other combinations at any grimaldis location. Id rate their other flavor combos as if you are craving pizza, and you choose grimaldis, you choose good."}
{"text":"$45 for a small \"Mediterranean\" salad that had a sprinkle of feta 3 red onion rings and 8-10 kalamata olives and 2 cucumber slices sectioned into 1/8ths and a large pizza is really expensive.   I got a pesto pizza with chicken ($5 topping) it's Sysco chicken pieces folks not real chicken breast and not worth $5) artichoke hearts $3 sun-dried tomatoes 2 or  3 bucks and red onions that's right another 2 dollars.   The pizza overall was OK good crust but not a good value for the money. If they want to charge that much for toppings they should seriously address the quality. Verrazano's makes a better pie IMO for a LOT less money. Don't think I'll be ordering again."}
{"text":"It was good! Nice thin pizza with a sturdy crust. I found it strange that the ham was cubed, but this style worked with the sausage. Added some peppers to the top and the pizza was heavenly! Perfect for a quick take-to-the-hotel-meal. thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Pizza is really really good. The thin crust it's the best and the ingredients are fresh and very tasty."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Lots of great toppings to choose from.   The personal pizza is large enough for two ladies to split.   Drink menu needs a little work: not a lot of cocktail options. Sangria wasn't great. Also get bottled water: their tap water tastes a little odd.   House salad lettuce was a little wilted- could probably be improved.   Great spot to stop and have lunch if you're in the shops or need a break from the casino. Very comfortable, casual  environment, not too loud- will be back!!"}
{"text":"Found this place on our recent trip to Scottsdale. The pizza is excellent. We are from Ct and there are a few places such as Frank Pepes that are reportly the best. This place is better. Great food and a nice selection of beer and wine. We will be back for the food and the great weather for this time of year."}
{"text":"Great food but should add more toppings to pizza they didn't really put much pepperoni on the pizza and the wait is long"}
{"text":"Today was the worst experience we have had in a restaurant in a long time!  We waited 45 minutes to sit down for two.  They forgot about us and the manager had to get the girls to sit us down.  Then lazy waiter brought us our drinks in paper cups saying they ran out of glasses.  We waited nearly an hour for one pizza when I called the lazy red headed waiter over.  He knew we were pissed and said talk to my manager before I had a chance,to complain.  The manager apologized and paid for our pizza which we took to go.  We will never go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY.  With that said I am rarely satisfied when eating pizza outside of my hometown.  I moved to Tempe a couple years ago for school and went to a couple pizza spots - some good, some bad.  This past weekend while walking around Old Town my buddy and I stopped at Grimaldi's and I am very thankful we did.  We ordered a salad and pepperoni pizza and both were terrific.  The brick oven flavor was what I've been missing since I moved.  Wait staff was extremely nice and I will be returning to Grimaldi's soon."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza is from Uno's  located on Lomabard St in San Francisco, CA.  They have the best pan pizza I've ever tasted.  At Grimaldi's, they offer thin crust pizza and it's good.  Very Good.  My family always orders the white garlic with  pesto, chicken and mushroom.  It does not have tomato sauce which my son doesn't like.  Every order is like that, pick up or dine in.  The dine-in experience is excellent. The waiters are mindful of who they are waiting on and my glass is never left empty.  I do consider Grimaldi's the best pizza in the area.  If I have a non-thin crust pizza craving, traditional pizza at Angelina's is option.  For the deep dish pan pizza, BJ's is available across the street.  But Grimaldi's Pizza is very good."}
{"text":"The bottom of the crust was burned (black) resulting in the pizza being somewhat cardboard like and less than enjoyable.   Even thought there were only a few customers we never saw the server again after she dropped off our order... would have appreciated a \"How is everything\"."}
{"text":"Came in with a large group.Hostess was a doll. Busboy was an angel. Server , a total wreck.He rushed us to order, basically threatened if we didn't order right then it would take \"forever\" to get our food. Scoffed when we asked for butter for our bread basket. Why don't they have butter by the way? None, at all. Didn't run out, they just don't supply it. Canoli, hard as rocks. Awesome food runner action , pizza was great too. Had reservations ,Told the server & whoever took the reservation this was a bday celebration but no love. BTW they asked ME what the occasion was when I booked 2 weeks earlier, So I assumed they asked so we could get at least a freakn candle on a piece of desert after spending 200 bucks, but nope. Also asked for coffee & the response was \"we don't have any\", wow, that hurt!  Yikes, scared me off, thats fo sho! PS half my party was overweight & we were stuffed into a tiny space with zero elbow room like a bunch of sardines!"}
{"text":"5 stars are pretty hard to come by. I should review more, but time and all. This is how pizza should be. Great thin crust, hi temps and fresh ingredients. The server suggested a bruschetta. Man it was great. My 4 yr old and wife both wanted a pepperoni so we got one one those also. It was very good.  My wife said it was the best pizza she has ever eaten.    Very good service and I loved the atmosphere. I really like the fact that the menu is very small. I have always been of the opinion, do what you do best and excel.   It was pretty expensive though. It was almost $50 for 2 pie's, 3 soda's and tip. We did have plenty to take home. We wont be eating there that often as money is kinda tight. Takeout would be quite a bit more affordable so that's a good option."}
{"text":"Wow what a kick ass pizza joint for a chain. Mind you the chain is based on the original that is in Brooklyn under the bridge. Coal Fired Oven pizza, I am now a true fan. The crust, oh the crust, how many ways can you melt in my mouth. It is different enough from regular pizza that is worth the price of admission. Do yourself a favor, no shut up and listen. Get in your car, drive to Grimaldi's (if you are lucky to have one close) and go enjoy a slice of heaven."}
{"text":"Not bad pizza but the wait is way too long.  Would be nice if they could be more accommodating in that respect.  It would make the experience much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"We love this place and the food is always great. Unfortunately it was spoiled by the GM Mike Devine. He walks up to our table as we are finishing our drinks after just paying the check and says \"we have a reservation we need to seat, so if you could finish\". That's it and just walks away. I have never had anyone approach me at a restaurant and do that, especially the GM. He should not have a position like that if he doesn't know how to communicate properly to customers.  It's really unfortunate cause our waitress was great and of coarse the food is alway. Grimaldi's you just need to find a GM with some class!"}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped in after walked around Old Town Scottsdale for dinner. We got seated immediately even at the dinner rush and had great service. We had a pesto pizza with chicken, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes. It was amazing, perfect balance of everything and cooked just right. We will be back"}
{"text":"Had heard food was good, but pricey. We spent more than we needed to, but only because we didn't know what we were getting. One small pizza would easily feed my two kids and me. Everything we ordered was great. Service was excellent. Our server, Sam, was very accommodating when we wanted to relocate away from a rowdy group. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I fell in luv w Grimaldi's during my visit to NY. Unexpectedly, I found it here in Vegas! Olleh! Let's try here in Vegas:)  As usual, got L size pizza w extra cheese/pepperoni/mushroom and it was good (although not as much as its original NY location)   My main complaint was mozza cheese! It wad supposed to be thick cheese layer for $2 topping as it mesmerized me in NY, but not really... (You can judge it from my picture) Other than that, it is still awesome pizza!  Staff and manager were super kind during my pick-up as well  don't forget its $5 coupon from web:) All end up less than $20 after tax (large pizza $18 / each topping $2)"}
{"text":"No comparison to the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, NY. Very poor pizzas, like they are made by an unprofessional. The pizza I ordered was such watery that all the toppings were falling off. The mushrooms were totally raw and the dried tomatoes were huge in pieces! On the top of that, our rude waiter made me 100% disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their pizzas! Always our favorite.. Pepperoni, Italian sausage, mushrooms and basil. Thin crusts, crisps, Brooklyn style, perfection. Delish.. (They make their own mozzarella!) Salads are fresh and delicious! (Tried them all) Service always friendly (so far). It would be a solid 5 stars if they had better wine and dessert options. Tiramisu is the best if you must have dessert. Not bad for a chain.. Go get their pizzas. YUM!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is great, very thin crust fresh ingredients, not greasy at all."}
{"text":"Awesome salad, pizza and cheesecake at a great price for vegas..   Great service too."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It's hard to find good pizza here in Las Vegas, but now that I found this place I am gonna call it pizza home:-) Check out the Margarita pizza, excellent!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. Their pizza is breathtaking and don't get me started with their employees. They're just amazing all together. Their employees always have a smile on their face and they always try to serve you to their fullest. I got a pizza where i put all kinds of meat and it was just delicious. The first time i tried this i fell in love. I would absolutely go back to this place."}
{"text":"The pizza is TheBomb.com. I thought I would try something different, so I got the \"small\" pesto, pepperoni, and fresh garlic pizza. 1. The \"small\" is not small. It's like a typical medium/large pizza that you would get from a lesser pizza joint. 2. The flavor in my mouth is phenomenal. 3. It was ready when I went to pick it up and 4. They have a full bar in the restaurant. The only negative aspect is that they don't deliver, which isn't necessarily a bad thing because if they did, I would certainly be 100 lbs heavier. Delish!"}
{"text":"I love Pizza, It's my favorite food and I probably eat more than I should of it! These guys make the best pizza I have ever had. I wish it was a little cheaper because I would go there every week instead of every time I have some friends or family in town. BUT its probably good its more expensive so I don't get too fat! Really friendly waiters and hostesses.  Never had to wait to long to sit or pick up an order.  I want to stress this pizza is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service. Salad was good. It has a feeling of an authentic Italian restaurant, similar to tastes we experienced while in Italy. The server was very attentive and the manager on staff was jumping in and serving and checking on tables. We will go back."}
{"text":"Grimaldis 5 years ago was delicious. We got sick so many times know that we don't go back. So sorry but we were fans. Not anymore. The service was amazing. Now we don't like it. So sorry :("}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes this ranks with the best I've ever eaten.  The crust, sauce, toppings and cheese are fabulous.    Service was kinda slow and the tables are packed into the place so you are close to other tables."}
{"text":"Just as good as the location on Eastern Ave. Plus a little better in my eyes since the patio is a little nicer at this location. Now if they could only open another location closer to my house so I can have delivery. I would give them six stars for that.   I do find it funny how you see a lot of Californians come out just to eat the pizza here. I do sympathize since its impossible to open a new coal pizza oven joint in the golden state. (From what I have heard). On second thought maybe I don't since we need the tourists."}
{"text":"Had small Ceased salad and a white pizza.  The salad was good but some of the lettuce was wilted.  The white pizza , with tomatoes and basil was very good.  I found the crust to be soggy.  The pizza would be great if the crust were crispy. Too dough like."}
{"text":"Turns out this place really was more hype than substance. It's good, but not great like people have been raving about. Cooking pizza in a coal oven is tricky and every easy to mess up and hard to get a consistent product out of unless you really know what you are doing. The two \"cooks\" I watched doing the pies weren't paying attention, and our pie was underdone, while the table next to us got theirs overcooked, The waiter we had just couldn't focus, despite not being busy, or he is a bad listener, forgot our salads, but made up for it by comping them without being asked. Desserts were institutional and overpriced. Think I went here a long time ago when it was a Tomaso's but I could be mistaken.  People said Do Grimaldi's-OK, I've done it, now I am over it. On to the next place."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza!  From service to food to atmosphere, this pizza joint is simply the perfect way to end the work week in LV.   Food: Pizzas definitely belong in coal brick-ovens!   -Pizza: Crunchy smokey thin crust pizza with delicious fresh mozzarella. The topping choices are endless. We went with sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives, extra basil, and mushrooms. Since the large size was only $2 more than the small size, we got the large and ate pizza all weekend. ;)   -Caesar Salad: I love Caesar salads. I order them everywhere I go. This one was perfect. Fresh romaine. Shredded parmesan. Smokey croutons. Tangy creamy Caesar dressing. Portions are huge. Small salad was more than enough for two.   -House Salad: Felt like we made a trip to the Mediterranean salad bar. Tomatoes, roasted red pepper, mushrooms, olives in vinaigrette dressing. Not bad. -Beer: Blue Moon or Stella on tap go oh so well with pizza. Don't get the house wines, they're not very good.  Service: We've sat at both the tables and the bar. Service is stellar either way. Waiters/bartenders are friendly. Food comes out fast. They check in with us just enough. What more can you ask for?  Atmosphere: This restaurant is especially great on a warm summer evening with a big outdoor patio. The bar is also a great place to watch the game.   Parking: The only knock against this place is that the parking lot in this plaza sucks. Half the lot is reserved by Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Lame. So as soon as you pull into the lot, keep an eye out for parking."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas and went to this restaurant on my 30th birthday.  I did not want to go to a place with outrageous prices so we ended up here.  We live in Jersey and have never tried the Brooklyn location, so this seemed like a good opportunity.  The drinks were great and were honestly a steal for Vegas.  I would go here again just for the prices of the drinks.  We started with the antipasto platter which was delicious. The pizza was awesome!  I have had some amazing New York pizza and this was as good as it gets.  Truly delicious.  The prices were incredible for Vegas and we were able to go all out and not break the bank.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and would go back again on my next trip!"}
{"text":"This is one of our family's favorite places to eat. The pizza and the service is always the best. The prices are a little high for pizza and salad or I would definitely give Grimaldi's 5 stars..."}
{"text":"Inside The Fashion Show Mall...absolutely a delicious Pie, excellent service, pretty cool vibe and great seats out front watching the \"beautiful people\" stroll. Fantastic Pizza..period!"}
{"text":"I was a guest in the hotel and called down to place an order for pickup.  I went down at the appropriate time and they hadn't even put the order in yet.  They weren't busy and it still took an inordinate amount of time.  The pizza was good, but not great.  The water  in Las Vegas will never be what the water in NYC is, whatever they tell you about trying to recreate it, and therefore the dough and crust will never be the same."}
{"text":"Food always comes in a timely manner. Although the service could be better. We always come back because the pizza is perfectly thin, crispy, and always has just the right amount of toppings. Always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars! We ate here on Saturday (April 2nd). The food was good, service was ok. But when it came time to pay the bill, the waiter messed up and over charged my credit card, so the manager voided the transaction and rerun my credit card a second time. Guess what, it was for the same amount as the first time. So the manager said he had to cancel that transaction and rerun it for the third time. That amount was correct. The manager gave us two $5 coupons and asked us to come back and give them another chance. (NOT GOING TO HAPPEN) Today I checked my account and there was still the second and third transaction posted to my account. I wonder how many other people this business has done this to?"}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. Not sure how it compares to the original Brooklyn version, but I thought it was awesome. I just wish we had one in the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"Great time here tonight. Nice selection of wine, really good salads and outstanding pizza. The staff made it extra special. I am a big fan of Chicago thin but this pizza was perfectly made, very crispy and had outstanding ingredients. The open kitchen leaves no where to hide so you can count on their quality.  Bonus when the pizzialo spun a dough purposefully over the wall to my delighted son."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Grimaldi's. The atmosphere in their outdoor dining area was great for a warm evening. My husband loved the pizza. I was feeling a little sick while we waited for our food. As soon as I told our waiter, Paulo, he immediately boxed up our pizza and brought out the check for us so that I could get home as soon as possible. He also offered soda water to help my stomach feel better. I opted for a Pepsi instead, which he provided at no charge. Paulo's impressive service was a lifesaver that night."}
{"text":"I'm so sad because pizza is my favorite food. Though the pizza was not bad, I had to wait over an hour. They apologized and offered more bread. We refused because we wanted to save our appetites. When the bill came, they didn't even comp my $2 side of anchovy. I feel as a customer who doesn't complain (until now) I would appreciate some acknowledgement."}
{"text":"After leaving the movie theater we were looking for a place to have dinner. Upon exiting the theater we saw 2 places in front of us; Grimaldi's and the Blue Burger Grill. We chose Grimaldi's. The place looks really cool, I love the decor, it is elegant and yet casual. I especially love the pictures of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr. The service was really good. The food is not great but really good. We ordered a 16 inch pizza with tomato and mushroom. It was delicious. If you like ranch with your pizza be warned that they do not offer ranch. The price was reasonable. Overall this place is a very good pizzeria. I will be returning quite often."}
{"text":"I really went on an off day I guess based on all of the great reviews this location gets.  We were promptly seated, waited on and served, but after that the waiter just did not ever come over again.  He never offered refills, never offered dessert and when we told him that we were going to order another pizza to bring home with us, he never came back to ask if we wanted to order that.  Meanwhile, he was taking care of other tables.  If they were short handed, shame on them, but at least tell us that.   I usually go to the Palazzo location as that's so easy in and out even though it's on the Strip, that I will just continue to go to that location.  Very disappointing.    To me, good service makes the food taste great.  Bad service just ruins everything and that's a shame."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here yesterday.  We called for reservations cause we were a party of 13.  They don't take reservations but when we got there they had a table set up for us.  I love their pizza.  But I do like to put ranch on my pizza.  They don't have ranch.  If you love thin crust pizza this place is for you.  However I noticed the pizzas ordered with more than one meat topping were greasy in the middle, they still tasted yummy.  For being a die hard Chicago stuffed pizza lover I left very happy with a full belly.  However the scale wasn't so happy this morning...."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite \"chain\" pizza, by far. The brick oven is not hype -- it makes a difference. Consistent, high quality, clean, and great service. The pizza has tons of flavor with a wide variety of options.  That said, I could not disagree more with the review that compared this to Bianco. Grimaldi's isn't even in the same league as Bianco, but I would not expect them to be. And, Grimaldi's has the advantage of not having to wait 2 hours for a table....."}

Sunday night 5:30 pm, 9 of 11 guests were present with 2 guests in route; but the hostess, citing company policy, would not even take our name down for seating half an hour later as \"all if our party was not present\". When the rest of our party joined us at 6:00 pm, we were quoted a one hour wait. Grimaldi just lost the business of big spenders and big tippers, including a restaurant GM who lives and works in the area. To quote Pretty Woman, \"Big mistake!\" BJs Brewery, here we come."}
{"text":"I love this place! Pizza is always so good, staff is adore, great atmosphere! Love the one on Eastern. Big open windows and space. Just needs an ocean!"}
{"text":"Great place....best Pizza on the west side , Kurt is the best !!! Cold Peroni on tap !!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's never fails to disappoint. The antipasto is always fresh as well as the pizza. I brought my boyfriend here for his first Grimaldi's experience and he is now a fan. Service here is friendly and helpful. Nice views of the Wynn from the windows."}
{"text":"I usually have the pizza here but the other things they have are good also. There is really nothing bad you can say about the pizza. The sauce is incredibly tasty. The crust is tasty and not too thick.  Their service is also top notch. On my last visit, by mistake I ordered a larger pizza than I usually get. It was my fault but after I asked why the amount was larger than expected they lowered the bill to the price of the smaller pizza even though I still got the one I ordered.  Parking can be an issue there on busy nights so if you do a pick-up order look for the specially marked spots right up front for Grimaldi's pick-up orders."}
{"text":"Pizza its okay. Service is slow, but we didn't mind since it was a family night out. The house chiantilli was good and cheap. However, I wouldn't say its the best pizza in town and service needs to be refined."}
{"text":"I dream about this place!  Everything is sooooo tasty!  I love their antipasto, their pizza, their calzone, and their dessert!  YUM!  The staff is also very nice and helpful, as well!"}
{"text":"Was refered to this place by someone who I guess has no tastebuds.it was like eating a saltine cracker with bland salsa on the pizza.It smelled like a sewer entering this  place,and when we asked the host what the smell was all about, he said alot people complain about it.We asked our server and she informed us it is the coal shipped in from PA.and when they first fire up the oven it gives off some sort of sulfur oder. Nothing special about the salad,it was the small antipasto and we added some salami. We hardly seen or tasted any salami.I would definately recomend Oregano's for your pizza enjoyment as regular customers we are,this place gets the big one out of five for the rating today."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza restaurant. My mom and I come here often. Their salads are tasty as well, but of course they are known for their pizzas. We enjoy the pepperoni and mushroom with the traditional red sauce pizza. I have had several other toppings on the pizzas and they have all turned out great. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Always love stopping by this place for a pie when I'm in town.  The service has always been GREAT!!! The pizza is EXCELLENT... having the open kitchen makes you want to order more even when you just can't seem to get another slice down. We used to go to the other location on queen creek until they closed now we come to the one on Ray Rd.  The prices are very reasonable two large pies will feed about 8 persons with two pieces each....but I'm sure three pies wouldn't hurt. Anyway, thank you Grimaldi staff for making a great pizza and providing such good service!!"}
{"text":"Favorites pizza place in Vegas hands down! And I love their Mediterranean salad! Decent prices and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a couple times and it's always delicious. Brandon was our server this time and was helpful. We went in the afternoon so it was quick. Perfect for my lunch date with my daughter between shifts."}
{"text":"Best pizza we have eaten in Vegas so far. We have tried a number of them and this seems to be our go to. Yes it is a chain but still the atmosphere and service is great."}
{"text":"My life was ruined after eating REAL New York style pizza. Lombardi's has scarred me for life. Thankfully, I was able to pay a visit to this place and get a very solid NY style pizza. It's obviously not quite the same, but it's still dang good. Crust is super thin, toppings are wonderful, and the service was great. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I found this place too expensive for what you get. To me this compares to dominoes but three times the price. The crust was great. I expected fresher ingredients. I will definitely not recommend this place to my friends. I will drive an extra half an hr to eat at piazza all forno in glendale"}
{"text":"I am no food critic by far but I know good food. This was my first visit to Grimaldi's and I will definitely return. This pizza was thin crust with fresh ingredients, which makes a difference. We didn't wait long to be seated or to get served, it helped that we went a little later. Very nice atmosphere and truly enjoyed myself. I would definitely suggest this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Best calzone I've ever had :) service could use a little help but other then that, great experience!"}
{"text":"Went to a group family party here. So glad I wasn't paying. We sat and chomped on ice, had to wait forever on refills. Food was so-so...definitely not worth what the group ended up paying for. Once again, this place disappoints at every opportunity. Pizza crust is too thin and burnt and flavorless-unless you like charcoal. Even for free I was less than impressed."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever had in my life. The ingredients were fresh, the crust was just right and the flavor was out of this world. The staff is friendly and the wait was not bad at all. The prices are great compared to other restaurants in Vegas. If you love pizza, you'll love Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have eaten in Vegas and one of the best pizzas I have ever eaten (the best pizza I have eaten is in downtown Disney). I gave them 4 stars because their service is incredibly slow but in my experience man of the restaurants in Vegas have slow service. Definitely worth a try and I may be going back for seconds before I head home."}
{"text":"Very tasty, true New York style pizza. The deserts were above average as well. The toppings were a little expensive for the small/personal pizza at almost $2 each, but the flavor was worth it.   We had drinks and desert (the pick 3 deserts for $10 made up for the price of the pizza and we were not disappointed). Will def be back here or picking up.   You can't miss this pizza!"}
{"text":"Always busy in there, great indication that the food is great.    Caprese Salad for appetizer...yum  We ordered the ham and mushroom pizza: was an authentic thin crust with fresh ingredients.  But what we will be back again and again for will the CALZONE!!! We ordered the pepperoni and mushroom...we enjoyed it more than the pizza.  5 stars just for that =)  Servers and managers were friendly, constantly attentive.  Great dinner."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Gotta have ricotta! Always on the hunt for great pizza and I typically don't like chain restaurants but this is honestly the best ever. New York style with a thin crust, not greasy at all, and the service is great. Always going back to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"The crust wasn't cooked through.  Bottom was black but top of crust was just wet, under-cooked dough.  Gross.  See pics."}
{"text":"I visited this place during lunch. It was 4 adults and 1 child. The service was friendly through out the whole meal however they took forever for refills. They gave our baby pizza dough to play with which was nice. The pizza was very delicious. I will return."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, not quite as good as the Grimaldi's in NYC, but it's a mall afterall so no big expectations. One huge negative I have to comment on is the glasses of water, it was horrid and undrinkable and all 3 of our glasses tasted the same. I don't know if it's a deliberate ploy to coax you into buying a bottle of designer water, but it was negative enough for me to not come back and go to the CPK nearby instead."}
{"text":"This place is always a good choice! Twice in a week i have been here. Both times were togo and both times i had to wait for the oven. Willing to wait as I know that it can take a bit for this process. I just sat at the bar where thr wait staff at the time constantly checked on me. I always recommend this place if you want a quality pie that does not make you feel sick after eating."}
{"text":"Three words: Best Pizza Ever! I'm a fan for sure! Also, great location in the center of Old Town Scottsdale. I've also visited the location near the Palazzo Hotel in Las Vegas, NV."}
{"text":"Great service, great pizza.  We eat here often and recently had our wedding reception here.  We reserved two of their adjoining banquet rooms, and everything was perfect.  The food was delicious and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Everytime we go to Vegas.  This is the spot to visit for excellent delicious cesear salad.  Let's talk about this pizza OMG OMG so so good people. We ordered our own speciality pizza everything was so fresh and delicious. The long island ice tea drink is what my kids call LIT. I don't even look for the pizza place in my hometown because I refuse to cheat on this location. I feel horrible for not remembering our waitress name I blame it on the drinks lol. People the pizza still taste excellent cold. Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"We ate here twice while staying at the Venetian. Pizza was excellent, we had just cheese one day and meatball the next time. The caprese salad was excellent. Waiters, bartender and hostesses were all very nice and enjoyed there wit and knowledge. I look forward to trying the one by my home in Florida"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place.  Went Saturday night, we will page you, waiting 20 minutes outside  (nowhere to sit inside but the bar) people go in. Went in to check,  oh we will sit you now. Waited 10 minutes for waitress, ordered received drinks and never saw her again until 1 1/2 hours go by. Had to flag her over  (she was working the bar as well) asked does it always take this long.. other customers we're joking the reason the pizza tastes so good is because you're starving when it gets here. The manager showed up and said I heard you're having a problem said yes waited an hour and a half so far she said it's Saturday night had to remake your pizza the oven is down we'll get on it right now. Didn't get to try their Pizza got up and left McDonald's was sounding great."}
{"text":"We dined there yesterday order two large pizzas very disappointed we received a margarita pizza with pepperoni on it being a vegetarian , that's not cool !! They did make us another pizza however it was just slap together with nothing on it very bad experience been there many times I think it's time to look for another pizza restaurant !!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars on behalf of my husband. He loved his personal pizza. My daughter and I shared a cheese pizza and thought it was just ok. It tasted pretty plain; more sauce than cheese. The caprese salad was also just ok. We had to put our own oil and vinegar on. Service was pretty good and wait times were accurate. Convenient location."}
{"text":"It was my first time getting a pizza from this place and I ordered it to go. The toppings were pepperoni and mushroom, I could count the mushrooms and for covering the bad quality they had a lot of tomato sauce on top of the pepperoni and the FEW mushrooms. The dough was undercooked. Over all I think dominos has a better quality. I was really surprised to have a pizza this bad specially they charge so much for it.  I post the picture of the pizza I got so you can be the judge of that."}
{"text":"Great food and I witnesses outstanding customer service today from the management at this location. I will be back!"}
{"text":"A little \"slice\" (pun intended) of NY in Vegas! This is some tasty pizza and highly customizable, great for splitting with friends. Lots of selection if you don't happen to be in the mood for a triangular piece of heaven.   I've been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. The slightly crunchy thin crust pizza is cooked perfectly each time; it's great but not super filling or overwhelming like some pizza can be. From peppers to pineapple they have any topping you desire. They use fresh mozzarella on the pizza so it's not oozing with a thick layer of cheese (a positive in my book), rather there are spots of cheese all around the pizza. The salads are enormous and wonderful. My favorite is the Caprese. You'll definitely want to share one of those bad boys.   The outdoor seating is awesome when the weather is right and the indoor seating feels like an Italian grandmother's kitchen, dough flying through the air and pizza ovens hard at work. There's also a little bar with TV's you can plant yourself at as well. The staff is very nice and attentive. A great outing for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is awesome . Food was good but it took awhile . Tiramisu was great and the beer selection was amazing . We will come back."}
{"text":"Ii am addicted.  spectacular service and consistent, quality. food every time. i have been ordering take out and dine in for months and grimaldis does not disappoint.  only once...they gave my takeout pizza to the wrong person....christine, the manager, very generously apologized, comped my new pizza, and bought me a glass of wine as i waited.  grimaldis is a class act and has a fantastic staff with excellent food.  every time."}
{"text":"In NYC people line up 'round the corner for the shot to sit at one of the small tables at Grimaldi's Pizzeria under the Brooklyn bridge and order one of their famous thin crust pizzas.  Now, on one of those days when you're tired of waiting well over an hour, it might be tempting to board a flight to Phoenix to eat at one of the OTHER Grimaldi's locations (none of which are in NY).  Yeah, can  you believe there's a Grimaldi's in Scottsdale, Arizona?  I couldn't.  The menu and the story is the same, but, of course, it doesn't feel completely authentic outside of NY.  The coal oven is massive and the pizza tasted great.  These Arizonans don't know what they're missing!  They should be lining up for this."}
{"text":"First off our waiter Francis was AWESOME! He was very attentive  and kept refilling my husband's drink (He goes through a lot of soda) and asking us if we needed anything. Since this was our first time visiting Grimaldi's he went over the menu and explained the different styles of pizza. He also let us know how big the portion sizes are and what size we should order. Now let me reiterate, he was not pushy AT ALL. My husband and I ordered the Caesar salad, pesto pizza and regular pizza. IT WAS DELICIOUS!! I could not get over how wonderful it tasted. Again, Francis made sure we were satisfied and even made sure the Caesar salad and pizza tasted good to us. It even caught me off guard that  Mr. Haunschild the general manager, came over and asked us how we were. That to me is a sign of an excellent establishment. It made for a very pleasant visit and experience."}
{"text":"We really love Grimaldi's Pizza! Every time you come to Scottsdale we are sure to stop at least once if not more times at Grimaldi's! The brick oven pizzas are wonderful salads are great and we've never had poor service! I recommend this anybody!"}
{"text":"THE PIZZA WAS PHENOMENAL. My brother, cousin and friend came out to Vegas to visit me and we spent over an hour looking for this place but it was totally worth it. I can think of nothing bad to say about this place other than the fact that the line was very long (probably due to the fact that the food was so great). I would go there again in a heartbeat and next time I'm at the Venitian you can count me in for the pizza and a beer. Go there if you want a taste of Italy!"}
{"text":"After watching a lot of food network, I've been in the mood for thin crust pizzas. However, being in my third trimester, I was not going to tolerate waiting an hour for it, which automatically crossed off most of the top rated pizza places in the Phoenix area. Decided to try the Grimaldi's Gilbert location for lunch and was not disappointed!  Came on a weekday during prime lunch hour and there was plenty of seating, service was prompt, friendly and attentive. The thin crust was great - light, crisp, tasty...not soggy at all. The toppings were fresh, not overloaded. Pizza's came out within 10 min or less of us ordering, but we were offered some bread while we waited. Bread was meh, just some cut up cold french bread, nothing special...but still devoured.  I got a personal size white pizza with the base mozzarella, extra basil, and roasted red peppers. The red peppers were a little sparse, and I don't remember them contributing too much flavor. I do wish the cheese had been gooier (sp?), perhaps if I had ordered extra cheese. But overall very tasty. My husband got the red sauce pizza with extra basil and pepperoni which was also very tasty. Pizzas were both wolfed down.  For the future, Grimaldi's will be our safe go-to place for well made thin crust"}
{"text":"It takes too long to get served. The order will be wrong. The place is dead. However, there is a ton staff cleaning tables that are already clean to get in your way when you make your way to the bathroom! So it can't be the economy."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is really good pizza.  It does remind me of many of the pies I had in NYC (reminds me of Arturo's a little bit) and I think their topping selection is awesome.  It's a crispy crust with just the right amount of chewiness and flavor.  Sauce has a nice flavor but I think it's a little nervy to charge extra for more sauce.  I've never had a pie from there that was greasy.  The DC Ranch location is beautiful, what a great place to sit outside with a delicious pizza and a cold beer."}
{"text":"Good food. Not the best pizza I have had but their crust is definitely in the top. Good place with kids. They give them a small ball of pizza dough to play with. Three stars because I went in with a large party and we were told it would be a thirty min wait. Even though the place was not busy and there were open tables everywhere. Finally after we waited thirty min, I think they felt bad and put together a couple tables, that were open the whole time we waited, and seated us. I think the hosting staff could be friendly. However I will be back to eat again."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza.   Thin crust.  Wood burning stove.  Chewy.  Good toppings.  Sign up and you get a free 18\" pizza for your birthday.  As a creature of habit we always get a Mediterranean salad, pepperoni pizza, and white pizza with sausage and onion."}
{"text":"FINALLY!!! This is the pizza that I have been looking for in LV.  Awesome thin crust.  A little on the pricey side, but who cares.  I'll be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I like the calzone and I will eat here on occasion usually to go. Each time I have eaten in the restaurant the hostess station is disorganized. The wait time is long but not because they are so busy. There were quite a few tables available that just needed to be clean. When I inquired, they indicated that I would have to wait for somebody to clean it. The manager is impressionable but appears to impede efficiency. The management of this location is not efficient or customer oriented"}
{"text":"I love thin crust pizza. Grimaldi's is decent NY style thin crust pizza. I like their sausage pizza. This place does not mess around. All they serve is pizza and salad. This review is just for the food. . A bit on the expensive side but worth it, I guess. You have to eat it ho fresh from the oven. Getting it \"to go'  is not the same as eating it there."}
{"text":"I've been to the Grimaldi's on Eastern twice before, but this was my first time at the Rainbow location. I cashed in a free large pizza with one topping pizza sent via email when you join their free online membership. I haven't been thrilled with the sausage on past visits so I had the pepperoni this time. It's hard to get excited over Hormel, but I did like the thick slices. The crust was better than ever before. It was crisp throughout, so often I've had soggy centers. I adore their mozzarella. It was a tasty pie. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"My brother and I came in to cash in my birthday reward of a free large one topping pie - Thanks VIP club. We were warmly welcomed by the manager and seated in a hurry. Our waiter was pleasant and eager to please. We knew we only had an appetite for the pizza so we skipped starters. The pizza was ready before long and we dug in. This was the best Grimaldi's pizza I've had to date. The crust was perfectly crisp throughout. I was impressed by the ovens at the Rainbow location, but these at Fashion Show Mall are dead on. The manager came by to see how we were doing and I praised the kitchen and their ovens for fabulous pie. She agreed they have one stellar team. Keep up the good work, Grimaldi's FSM!"}
{"text":"4 Stars - If the one waitress wasn't walking around clinking salt & pepper shakers together 5 times each table during our dinner, it would have improved the atmosphere a lot. The saving grace was our young server gal with a great smile, her service and the awesome pizza!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, coal fired just like New York any way you want it, salads are great too.  Much less attitude than the original New York location, which is a good thing!  Thank You"}
{"text":"I first got introduced to them back in AZ and ever since this is the only pizza place I go to!!  Love the pizza here well done is a must and there Mediterranean Salad is so bomb!!! The kids love playing with dough! great place for the whole family!!!"}
{"text":"Natalie us a great server. Food great and dessert trio is shareable. Love the energy here Sign up for the club cause they send u a free coupon for a pizza on your bday."}
{"text":"I have complained for years there are very few good New York style pizza restaurants in Las Vegas. I found this place by accident and was pleasantly surprised. The service was outstanding. The food was excellent and it is now my go to place for pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza you can get in Arizona hands down. A bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for!   Build your own pizza by choosing the size, sauce, and all the toppings. On our first try we had the red sauce with roasted red bell peppers and meatballs. The meatballs are sliced thin and have a great authentic flavor, while the peppers were out of this world, yet were a bit overwhelming in the sense that they dominated over all the other flavors. Not to mention the crust was to die for; thin and crunchy and cooked perfectly!  On our second visit we had another red sauce pie with meatballs, ricotta cheese, and mushrooms. The meatballs prevailed yet again, and this time we could really enjoy the amazing red sauce without the overpowering flavor from the red bell peppers. The ricotta is a MUST, and the mushrooms are a great veggie adding additional meaty consistency.   This venue is huge and we did not have any trouble being seated at lunch or dinner time. We sat in the outside courtyard on our most recent visit at lunch time, and it was very beautiful. I hope to sit there again after sundown to enjoy the lighting and romantic atmosphere.   This place is absolutely a must try for any pizza lover in the area!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We walked in, a family of 5 and we weren't even greeted by anyone. Then we were taken to the seating area and the racist white lady sat us in an under lit area apart from the other seating area. SERIOUSLY? Just because we're not the same skin color you sit us where we can't be seen? Honestly we didn't even all fully sit down until I decided to leave. Never going back again."}
{"text":"The pizza here is a little bit more pricey, but I think it's worth it! Also has great customer service and a good location in Old Town."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best pizza you will find in Vegas. They might be expensive but they definitely know what they're doing. My only complaint would be that some of their best pizzas are only available during certain months."}
{"text":"Truly a delicious pizza---the crust and sausage were divine! We went on a Tuesday and all wine (except house wine) was half off!!! I am truly impressed by Grimaldi's! The service was great, too. Next time you're at the Fashion Mall, don't pass this up!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, even better salads. Very good wine list & excellent service no matter how busy they are, and they are very busy lunch & dinner! Outside tables with heaters for cooler evenings & plenty of indoor seating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but on Yelp it said they also had spaghetti and other pastas when they don't. This was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Bugs, dirty dishes and poor service!  This location has really gone downhill.  Went last weekend and had to wait 30 minutes for a table of four and the place was not busy at all.  They must have been understaffed at the time.   When sitting at our table I noticed bugs crawling all over my sons chair.  I asked to move tables and the server offered a different chair.  When we finally moved tables I open up my silverware to find gunk still on the fork.  I went to an adjacent table and stole the silverware from there.  After finally receiving our food I was not impressed.  Salad looked like it had been sitting g out all day.  Pizza was ok and my kids ate it, but was it worth a $90 tab, no way.  I'll stick to my local pizza joint from now on.  I asked for a manager to discuss my problems yet he was \"tied up\".  We were late to get to an event so I was unable to discuss my concerns.  Suggestion. DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Ordered a large spinach salad for 2 of us to share and could hav made a meal for both of us with just the salad. Salad was too good to waste so we ate salad and took most of the pizza home."}
{"text":"The food is just alright.  We had dinner there on Mother's Day.  We ordered a large white w/ garlic topped w/ italian sausage & mushrooms, another large topped w/ mushroom, onions & green peppers and a large ceasar salad.  The pizza's were a bit soggy and didn't have enough cheese.  I like my thin crust pizza's to be slightly crisp w/ cheese that strings when you take a bite.  Ceasar salad was good.  The bill came to $70 including 4 drinks.    Side note:  I took off one star for the older female manager/hostess who seated us cause she seemed a little put out & rather crabby when seating us.  I took off another star cause they don't accomodate patrons w/ disabilities and mom's w/ sleeping toddlers, as I wanted to order & pay in advance for our group to lesson the wait time for the food to be ready while my dad w/ a walking disability & my 17 month old was napping in the car but I was unable to do so.  I was told by the hostess that they would need our entire party seated before I could order.  Kind of a bummer but at least the service by our waiter was really good."}
{"text":"We came here with 30 ppl on a Saturday night after a soccer game. They were great about keeping separate bills for each family. The pizza was nice and thin. Good quality toppings. FYI the antipasti salad isn't really a salad but a plate of antipasti with bread. Only drawback would be how long it took for them to bring out the food. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, pizza was on point  VERY satisfied customer. Large pep, sausage and bacon"}
{"text":"So, we usually go to the Boca Park location... We even saw Flaver Flav there once, not sure what that means...   Anyway, food at both locations is amazing.  Don't over do it with the toppings and your pizza will be legit.  I recomend Peperoni and Jalepeno, or fresh tomato and artichoke if you're a no meat person.  Getting to why this location gets 5 stars...   We sat at the bar to catch the playoff game, and had one of the best customer service experiences ever.    Tracy, the bartender, was rad!  She subtly began talking with us after she got us some beers and took our order.  Through casual conversation Tracy was able to identify what things we had in common and have genuine and engaging interaction with us.    After an hour or so of beers, pizza, and great service we had to go, but I would make the trip from Summerlin again for the same experience.  Thanks Tracy!"}
{"text":"Fly dropped into my pizza while we were eating...dead fly. Gross!!! Really I understand a lot of stuff but the server attitude or lack of even an apology was totally unappealing."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever!! Super thin crust with a crunch and chew till your last bite!! Real fresh mozzarella cheese!! Went here 2 days in a row,it was that good!! Only bummer is they dont have a bunch of them in California!! Really hope they expand to California soon,going through serious withdrawals!! Our server Lisa was great,actually carried out a conversation and super friendly!! Love this place,telling everyone about it!!"}
{"text":"the subway signs are a little cheesy (no pun intended lololololol) I had pepperoni and sausage pizza.  The edges were burned and tasted shitty, but the rest was good and tasted fresh.  This doesn't taste anything like pizza from new York, this is very west coast tasting.  Their menu is limited and they need to get breadsticks like the O.G.  Overall 2 stars, food alone gave me 6/10  mouthboners"}
{"text":"Our second  visit to this fine pizza emporium.  The first visit was in 2014.  My wife said that it was the best pizza she had ever eaten.  The return visit June 2017 yielded the same result. Awesome pizza and great service. You won't be disappointed.   W"}
{"text":"The waiter, attentitive... his manager also attentive. A wonderful experience from the time we walked in. The waiter came down to our level to talk with us. The manager came to our table as if we were old friends, and this was our 1st visit. The pizza? the best coal brick oven pizza I have ever had"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this pizzeria! So yummy! I've never had so much pizza in the past year, thanks too this place! The best pizza hands down! Always have to order any pizza with ricotta. It just makes your pizza so creamy and delicious!"}
{"text":"If you like pizza that has a thin crust but still that chewy consistency, then this is a good place for you. I can't comment on anything besides pizza and the Caesar salad, but both things were tasty. We ordered a large salad and split it between four adults and it was good amount to start out our meal. The only thing that I think could be improved, is more variety in topping selections.  The location is convenient in the Fashion Show mall across from the Apple store. Our server was attentive and friendly and they provide unbaked dough for children to play with while they wait for the food."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner sat at the bar. Kurt was our bartender. He was so nice and informative with the menu. We had the Caesar salad and the don pizza. I could over hear other employees and they were friendly. Would come back again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, great food, nice atmosphere, family friendly.  It's hard to eat any other pizza than Grimaldi's.  After visiting the original location in Brooklyn, this is very comparable to the great pizza they serve.   Always finish the meal with some original cheesecake.  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place in town no doubt. We have been getting pizza from this place for almost a year now and we seem to get the same quality service and food everytime. Kurt at the bar has been looking after us for months and he always provide us with great costumer service. Will definitely continue to come to this place."}
{"text":"Best pesto pizza. Best sangria. Best to go before or after dinner/lunch rush because it does get really busy. Reasonable prices and always friendly"}
{"text":"I used to come here once a week for lunch when I was taking classes in Old Town. I would sit at the bar and eat with no issues whether I was or was not drinking alcohol.   I came back to this establishment yesterday, May 13th for lunch with a friend. We arrived at 11:30am and we were what seemed to be the first customers of the day.   We sat down at the bar and a dark haired woman who apparently was the bartender brought us menus. I do not know her name because she did not tell us when she greeted us.   My friend and I both ordered waters to start because we had been outside all morning in 100 degree Arizona heat. The bartender brought us dinner menus. When I asked for the lunch menu she told me \"Grimaldis doesn't offer a lunch menu.\"  When the bartender came back to take our order I tried to make friendly conversation by asking why the restaurant was so dead. She gave me unnecessary attitude and seemed annoyed with both my friend and I while taking our orders.   Immediately after she put the orders into her computer she printed us a receipt and walked over and placed it in front of us not saying a word. I was planning to buy a beer to go with my lunch and felt very offended at her actions.   As we sat there waiting for our food all we could think and talk about was how uncomfortable and awkward this bartender was making us feel. We had had enough and decided to end the experience before the food was delivered to the table.   When we left I called another Grimaldis on the other side of town and asked if they offered a lunch menu and she told me that they do.   I understand people have bad days and sometimes you just aren't in the mood for small talk but lying about what your restaurant offers is unacceptable. I don't think I will be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"My family and kids love this restaurant.  We come here at least once a week.  Perfect pizza, cold and crisp salads and a cannoli with chocolate chips to top it off for dessert."}
{"text":"We had never been to Grimaldi's, so we thought we'd give it a try to celebrate our daughter's last day of school -- what a mistake!  The food was mediocre at best, and horribly overpriced!  It's a pizza joint for crying out loud, not a steak house!  We also didn't appreciate when our waitress smugly informed us, right before we'd even placed our order, that pepperoni & Ranch dressing \"do not belong on pizza\" and to not bothering requesting it.  We weren't going to, but that type of attitude turned us off immediately.  We will never go back.  Should have stuck with La Familia which is family owned, operated and has excellent food at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Will never return to this location.  It took an hour and a half to make one large pizza and a small cheese pizza. Staff was rude and did not come around. After the long wait we asked for our pizzas to go. It took another 25 minutes to get them to go. Don't waste your time go somewhere who cares about your business. Some of the staff were kissing and rubbing on each other while customers were waiting to be helped. Seems like there is no reason to have 8 people working if nobody is going to come around to help customers."}
{"text":"Yes I didn't want to like Grimaldis  but I had to give it a day in court  It is exactly what I thought a great New York Pizza was supposed to taste like The pizza was fresh, great sauce, awesome cheese, I got artichoke hearts as A topping because you can't find that topping all the time in regular pizza spots So in closing verdict good pizza great staff always crowded must try one time"}
{"text":"It must be the water as this truly is the best Brooklyn Pizza West of the Hudson.  Try not to be the first order or two out of the oven for the Lunch crowd.  Oven not being quite ready yet, at least that was why it was explained to me.  Also, if you're into walking around Old Town Scottsdale to see all that is there, then by all means visit that location, however, if you want to visit a modern shopping area, misters in the open areas, and a parking garage that always seems to have plenty of parking, visit the Scottsdale Quarter Location"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this is the best pizza joint i've been to in Las Vegas,better than Sammy's any day. I only wish they had the bbq chicken pizza like Sammy's has. I am at Grimaldis once or twice a month. If you haven't been, GO!"}
{"text":"my husband saw this place featured on travel channel's \"Pizza Paradise.\"  we had high expectations and was very eager to try some authentic New York brick oven pizza.  we were not let down!!  it was amazing :-) yummmm!! the pizza is sold with mozzarella and either tomato, white garlic, or pesto.  they have set prices for each size based on the sauce  base.  then u can choose the toppings (mushrooms, spinach, meat etc).  each topping is an additional cost.   the pizza crust was thin and crispy.  we had mushroom and spinach.  it was awesome!  we're definitely coming back.  one thing they didnt have was ranch dressing.  idk about u but i tend to like to dip my pizza in ranch.  (am i strange??  idk but u gotta try it like that)  however, even without ranch it was still delicious."}
{"text":"Best caprese salad in town. Awesome pizza. It's all about the cheese. Their cheese is stupendous. I could write sonnets about their cheese. I hope they pamper their cows with their own pillows at night and manicures. Hoofiicures? I've had pizza all over the world, lived in Italy, and this ranks in top five. Fresh tomatoes. Real pizza oven.   Beautiful."}
{"text":"Absolute s*** drove all the way there and no damn sauce. Took a buddy to show him and this... we sat and ate his  Barros pizza much much better!! ! Total miss!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for pizza and calzones. All pizzas are great but the white is the best. Get the riccota on it as well.  Sign up foe the club and get a free pizza on your bday. It is a deal!!"}
{"text":"Thin bubbly brick oven pizza: HELLO lovely!!  The hostess was on the phone when we came in so the manager came over & seated us in our choice of low top table. Apparently you get a free slice of cheesecake w/ a carafe of wine purchase.  We opt for a Lambrusco bottle and the antipasto to start.  The antipasto is a plate of bread and a plate of literally 4 slices salami, 4 slices mozzarella, 1 basil leaf, roasted red peppers, and 4 green olives and 6 kalamatas.  Not overly in love with this assortment- I could do a better antipasto from my refrigerator.  Where's the prosciutto??  The pizza though!! Thin crust happiness with that authentic chewy New York fold in half style.  The sauce was nice & chunky and even the small pizza is large for 2 people.  I basically went into a pizza coma and forgave the uninspired (though fresh) antipasto!  Pumpkin cheesecake as promised: great flavor and texture to the filling but the crust was soggy.  Maybe it was free because it was frozen or a week old?"}
{"text":"Really good gluten free pizza!  Cesar salad is just ok, but large portions. I don't think the take extra precautions when it comes to making food GF, but I'm ok with that because my allergy isn't life threatening. It's a good find."}
{"text":"Service was bad, extremely slow, orders that were placed after ours were brought before. When they finally came out they were the wrong size and one of the pizzas was burnt. We used to come with the family but will definitely avoid to come from now on. On top of everything we ordered another a dessert and the server forgot it."}
{"text":"My most FAVORITE indulgence!!! Their pizzas, salads and calzones are made with the freshest and highest quality ingredients!  They have amazing quality control... The manager actually checks the food to make sure everything that comes out of the kitchen is of the highest quality for dine-in and take-out. Service is impeccable... Ambiance is Italian style... Love the table cloths!"}
{"text":"Been here twice, once for take out and once dine-in. Take out was really average, not worthy of the price. It wasn't bad, it just lacked the luster promised by its reputation.  Gave it another shot dining in and was very pleased. The pizza was good, well done, service was punctual, friendly and very helpful. It really helped us enjoy our night out and relax... and that is what pizza is all about, right?  It's a bit costly for pizza but it's that gourmet pizza trend. In this case, I think you do get what you pay for, so it's on our list when we want to go out and have pizza.  I probably wouldn't take my kids here, though. It's not a restaurant that caters towards kids, the pizzas take a while to cook (as expected) and there isn't a lot of entertainment or ambience that is kid friendly. I'd rather save this for adults, I know having obnoxious kids around would certainly ruin the relaxing atmosphere for me."}
{"text":"A little pricey for pizza, but the coal oven doesn't run for free and with its unique taste, it's totally worth it. Great decor and a friendly staff make for a great dinner."}
{"text":"A little pricey for pizza, but the coal oven doesn't run for free and with its unique taste, it's totally worth it. Great decor and a friendly staff make for a great dinner."}
{"text":"Great experience and super staff.  When my pizza was too crisp Eric offered to have it remade and also checked that the new pizza was to my liking.  Our server Heather was friendly, prompt and super understanding.  Visiting from out of town and this was my first visit to any Grimbaldi's.  Highly recommend.  Quality ingredients and an even better staff."}
{"text":"LOVE their pizza; however, this pizza is FLAT, so don't be expecting a hefty deep dish pizza sized meal from this. We got the Brooklyn pizza, with ricotta cheese, tomato sauce and sausage. The pizza bread was delicious, its warm and crunchy and without all that oil that usually sits at the bottom of the pan. The pizza gives you that classic cheese stretch, so if that's one of your requirements, check. My only gripe was that there wasn't enough sausage, buut since everything else was so good I can forgive them."}
{"text":"Yum! Probably my favorite pizza place in Phoenix. Crust is crunchy and thin (but not too thin--I hate when pizza is ridiculously thin) and it's not over the top greasy. It satisfies a pizza craving without feeling like a disgusting disaster!  Salads are also good -- I've always been pleased! The small salad feeds two perfectly when you are splitting a salad & pizza. If I'm splitting a pizza with one person we either get the personal size or small. Personal if we are mildly hungry, of small if we are starving.   Sauce & cheese is pretty minimal which at first I was kind of afraid of, but now it's a nice refreshing change and tastes wonderful. If you like pizza oozing with cheese or heavy on sauce, order extra (though it will cost you for extra).   IMPORTANT! At 4pm everday they (forget the word...) refresh their coal ovens so they don't bake pizza between 4-5ish. That is inconvenient but I will overlook it because it is so good!  Service is good and atmosphere is great. Delish!!!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  The pizza was a thick pan and the crust was fantastic.  Their supreme pizza is really good and just loaded with toppings.  There is a happy hour that has some good deals.  Our server was kind of a jerk but the other servers were nice.  There are some TVs to watch the game as well."}
{"text":"Just had a pizza here with my family.  I ordered a pepperoni pizza for my kids and me and my wife spit the Brooklyn.  Our pizza was very bland and I had to put on bunch of Parmesan cheese and hot pepper to give it some flavor.  They had a single server for an entire section and was it slow!  They need to hire another person or buy that girl some roller skates.  Worse, my beer was not cold (but I still drank it all :P)...  I used a gift card to pay and they said my balance was zero, which was incorrect as I know I had over one hundred dollars on it.  I put the tip on the gift card and made a note to check my balance.  They charged me $3 more on the tip!!!  Not enough to go back and complain but still, the service was sub-par and food not very good, so I WILL be disputing it with VISA."}
{"text":"Nice open space for large groups. It's much cleaner than the original one in Brooklyn and they don't serve soda in a bottle which is good.   I split a large garlic white crust with fancy olives, mushrooms, and mini pepperoni. It was plenty of pizza for two dudes. The small salad was a big proportion too.   My advice, eat it fast! Don't wait because the texture gets a bit rubbery.  Everyone should try a New York pizza."}
{"text":"Found them on YELP & it lived up to their ratings!!! I had a 21st bday dinner for 17 people & they had the table ready our waitress was great & took care of everything. Pizza was amazing!!! Great place for a party or just dinner while in Vegas!!! Will definitely go again!!!! Bar was great & drinks reasonably priced &  strong & not watered down."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend shared our first date here and we have been coming for years ever since! Their pizza is to die for! The only complaint I would have would be that the pizza gets cold pretty fast sometimes. But it tastes great when you heat it up at home."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint.  Exceptional service, lots of beer and wine choices and the pizza was excellent.  The place has a casual atmosphere and was packed.  Aroma when you walked through the door was amazing.    We will be certainly go here again."}
{"text":"Great service. Food is delicious. Quaint patio. I've been here about 5 times. Consistently a great place for lunch"}
{"text":"We happened on this place while strolling through the mall, and this place was delicious! And quaint! And the staff was attentive! We shared a ceaser salad, and the Quattro Formaggi pizza...it was absolutely delicious! The various cheeses were strong, but their flavors were crazy good! We took leftovers with us to snack on during the car ride home!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza restaurant in the South Bay"}
{"text":"Terrible service! Arrived at 6:43 and waited for our pizza (which is one of their specialty pizzas, not customized) and waited, and waited. 7:48 rolled around and we still didn't have our pizza or salad. 6 other tables who arrived after we did had their meals served and our waitress finally told us our pizza was made wrong. The place wasn't slammed at all, either."}
{"text":"Walked in the door to the host listening to a server blatantly bitching about something, no acknowledgement, nothing, and another gentlemen with his back to the door who greeted me before the two girls staring right at me!  Our server was a little frazzled, but I am throwing that on tweedle dee at the front who clearly had triple sat her.  The place has a huge acoustics problem.. It was boisterously loud and echoey.  THe layout is really awkward, it is an oddly shaped place and that leads to tables being in odd spots.  We were in some sort of corner of a corner.  I was about to walk out as I was waiting for the hubster to find a parking spot (really tricky at this place on a weekend) and he found a spot quicker than our server greeted us (about 5 min).  But I felt bad leaving after he had spent so much time to find a place to park and we had wanted to try this place... We were actually trying it so see if it would be a good fit for a large (i.e 25 people) party we are planning in November (clearly we have decided against that)  I ordered a beer, I had asked what their draft selection was and she said that they had the Sam Adams seasonal (knowing Sam Adams usually has more than one seasonal at a time, this was as informative as telling me the beer was yellow).  I inquired more and the server said, \"oh, I don't know, its like light you know, definitely lighter than Blue Moon\"  I reply with, \"light in what sense because Blue Moon is not a heavy beer in the slightest bit\" ,( its actually an anti-beer..back in the serving days it is what I would suggest to people who want a beer that didn't usually drink beer). Her reply was \"oh Blue Moon is REALLY strong! So this beer isn't like this!\"  Oh jeez.  Really?!?!  Why I continued to ask for more clarification is beyond me, clearly this girl had never had actual beer in her life.. (having worked at a brewery for eight years, there is an inevitable beer snobbery that kicks in)  But, I have had some REALLY GROSS Sam Adams before (ie. their Winter beer with pine needles...yes, yes, pine needles...it tastes as air freshenery as it sounds)  Anyways, insert 3 more completely incorrect statements about beer later, and I just ordered the damn thing.  It was 118 out the weekend we went, and I just wanted something cold...all else fails I could just down it.  I was very thirsty by time it got to me...8 minutes later-with no head bc it sat at the well so long.  It was the oh so lovely host who brought it (which mind you, didn't look like she was old enough to serve the glass).  While waiting for my food (see below) I ordered a second beer...yeah, that one took so long to get to me it was warm...sigh.  About 30 min later the hubster's pizza came.  Mine, not so much.  Our server did not even acknowledge that my pizza was MIA.  I saw her frantically trying to get the managers attention.  I saw her impatiently talking to the expo. I saw her pacing.  Not once did she say, \"hey it will be just a moment on the pizza\".  Five minutes later she finally gets the manager to acknowledge she needs help.  Manager goes to the line, gets my pizza and delivers it.  Not once does the MANAGER say \"sorry about the wait, etc\".  I bring up the wait.  Her response...HA! \"Oh well, our pizzas are hand made, so they can't possibly all come out at the same time. And your pizza has fresh sausage on it, so clearly it has to cook for longer.  I mean you should see how it is when we have large parties, they never get their food at the same time. It is just how we do things here. You should of expected that for a fresh made pizza\"   WHAT THE HECK?!?!?!?!?! Did that just happen?!?  Oh and your FRESH sausage...it tastes just like the pepperoni on the hubsters pizza...tastes just like Jimmy Dean. Lady, don't patronize me. I worked in restaurants for 13 years, I watched the game happen the second our server realized she forgot to put my pizza in...Don't make up some lame excuse about pizzas can't possibly be ready at the same time for the same table...if that is actually true then you have a very POORLY run kitchen.  Our server was nice, but that didn't make up for the horrible service we got... Only part of it was on her end though.  I asked for a box, server said she would box it...ugh I hate that. What I ended up with was foil very loosely covering my pizza and thrown in a huge bag...umm...really?!?  You're a pizza joint and this is the best method you have for left overs?!  $50 for two pizzas, 2 beers, and a salad accompanied by obnoxious staff and overcooked pizzas....yeeeah no thanks!  Oh and they were rolling silverware outside on the patio... Sucks for the server that does it & I sure hope bugs don't land on the \"clean silverware\"."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent but this place had some seriously bad service and was incredibly loud and was absolutely frigid inside. The menu is pizza, salad, calzones. The mediterranean salad with chicken is pretty decent and is good sized. The individual pizzas are ginormous! I like the thin crust and the sauce. However, we went here with a group and while we were seated promptly, that was about it. Every single thing was screwed up at least once. All the drink orders was screwed up and given to the wrong people. Salads were given to the wrong people or not brought out at all. The waiter totally forgot to even bring out one salad and one pizza for two different people. He gave one woman another person's pizza and was a little miffed when these errors were pointed out. A manager did come to apologize but still. Also, it was extremely loud and we ended up getting out as soon as we could. And it was freezing in there, too! The wait for food was not too long but the wait for the corrected food was a little ridiculous but mainly because they had to either remake things or make them for the first time since the orders were placed so incorrectly with the kitchen. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Wow this is a great go to for pizza! Great atmosphere, the service was excellent with servers ready to fill glasses, take a plate etc. We had a spinich salad that was very fresh and the pizza and mozzarella were very nice. Best pizza I've had in years!"}
{"text":"These pizzas are similar to those we got in Italy.  Thin, crisp crust, not soggy from too many wet or greasy ingredients.  Order them with just a couple of ingredients, like mushrooms and cheese, with a glass of wine, and pretend you are in Rome or Sorrento.  That is how pizza should be.  Had to make my own at home on the grill until I found Grimaldis.  Lot of work saved."}
{"text":"Was at Grimaldis pizza in Las Vegas I walked in at 4pm. They said they were not serving pizza because everyday at 4pm  they clean the ovens.   They said I could wait 30 to 45 minutes.  I left.  I would not go if your looking to eat dinner there maybe late night"}
{"text":"Big ol \"meh\" from this enthusiast.  It looks fancy enough to where you'd think you would have good service......nope.  I stood in waiting area for 5 minutes before someone said anything to me.  We ordered the pizza before we got there, got our pizza about 12 minutes after we got there and were asked if we wanted drinks after we got pizza.  Took 15 minutes to get water to table."}
{"text":"Just can't find better than Grimaldis being in AZ. Coming from the east coast I can't deal with all these weird gross doughy pizza places. Grimaldis is absolutely #1!!! (#2 on list- Red Devil- the one on McDowell, the one in tempe isn't the same...#3- Florencia pizza in Ahwatukee, and they even have a Groupon sometimes) Other than that no good pizza in AZ that I'm aware of.   Props to Grimaldis for the most amazing ingredients & best cook on pizza ever!     Grimaldis is amazing. Ordered take out again, and I was very disappointed last time but this time it was absolutely spot on & perfect. Hands down the best pizza you can can find in Arizona."}
{"text":"Well, let me first start by saying my dinner last night at this place was me giving this place a second chance.   The first time I went I ordered my pizza with light sauce,   when my pizza arrived it had sauce oozing all over it.  The server was quite apologetic and offered me something else or to have the pizza remade, but I was with others and I didn't want to make them wait so I just opted to not eat.  So round two with this this place was even more traumatizing!   We arrived to wait for hostess to come up front because she was yakking it up with  the servers by the kitchen area.   We were seated in a little side room where we were pretty much ignored but I did get a good feel for the atmosphere.  After about 10 mins, waiting Server #1 strolled by and asked if we had been helped.   He gave me his name and took our drink and food order.  I once again mentioned I wanted light sauce on the pizza, no onions in my salad, and just a water w/lemon to drink.  Someone else brought our drinks and there was no lemon in the water so I asked Server # 2 for the lemon and he assured me he would bring back.  That never happened because a 3rd server brought our salads.   The salad was full of onions and so I did not eat it.  It sat on the edge of our table for about another 15mins until a 4th server brought our pizza.   The pizza was made correctly so I took a chance and asked this server for the lemon which he did return with and I gave him the salad and asked that he remove it from the bill because I couldn't eat it.  Through the meal no other servers ever checked on us.  In fact I had to flag down one just to get my daughter a drink refill.  The place was not very busy but yet all the Servers were clustered either by the kitchen or bar and everyone was laughing and joking amongst themselves, at one point I noted one Server swinging between the two counter areas.   I had to flag someone down again to get my pizza boxed and get my check.   I waited another 10 mins and no one ever came to get my check so I finally was annoyed and took the check to the front where once again the hostess was standing holding the front door open and chatting w/another employee and not at the hostess area.     I usually leave at 20% tip at most places because I do understand how hard Servers work as I used to work for a restaurant company, but this time the only tip I left was a note on the check stating they needed to improve their customer service.   As for the food it's mediocre at best, nothing really stands out about it, so I most definitely will not give them a third chance.  Their customer service ruined it completely for me.  :("}
{"text":"Really great pizza!! Crust is amazing. Portions are huge. A little pricey but you can taste the quality so you don't feel ripped off. Nice set up. Attentive staff. Will not disappoint"}
{"text":"ALWAYS good. The pizza is really fantastic. It's a tad pricey but worth it. Family style eating. Atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. I'm from Brooklyn and this is the best pizza I've had since my last visit back home. The service however is a completely different story. I had to ask for a refill after waiting 15 minutes of sucking on ice. It's a shame that the service wasn't as good as the food!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great and it's so original! The price is good and the food is great. But don't ask them for ranch it will highly offend them, they say that people use ranch to cover up the taste of bad pizza. The cheese is amazing!"}
{"text":"Wood fired crust.... We had a White pie w salami, meatball, garlic and ricotta..unbelievable!!!!!  Mouth orgasm!!"}
{"text":"So my store was having issues figuring out where to have our Christmas party. We had a plan set and a date but things fell through a week before and we needed to find somewhere casual, relatively cheap, and good for a group... But we needed to find it fast. Within a day, we had our group reservation booked at Grimaldi's. They really hooked us up; we had a huge table in the back (nice and quiet with lots of space) and the staff was so helpful and nice. Our bill came in WAY under our budget and we were all full (this included salads, beverages, pizza, and desserts). Best store Christmas party ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and wanted to go out for a pizza.  Jackpot!  Delicious,  flavorful,  thin crust pizza with a wonderful pizzeria ambiance."}
{"text":"Holy cow!! Stopped in for a light dinner. The Palazzo store doesn't offer by the slice ordering.  So I did a 12 inch with several toppings.  Perfect crust and prepared very well...tasty!   Added a salad.  Wow what a salad. One small could feed three people.   Keep that in mind when ordering.  Additional pizza ingredients are a bit pricy, but this is a pizza place in a Las Vegas strip leading hotel.   I would recommend this restaurant and will definitely return on my next trip.    Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza!!! OMG!!! Deliciousness!! The restaurant is very old school NewYork! The Bar is pretty too! The pizza choices are great, we like to build our own! It can get a little pricey depending on how many toppings you choose but it's worth the money!"}
{"text":"Seated promptly, but after 15 minutes had still not been acknowledged by wait staff. Proceeded to leave and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We wanted to try some pizza and stopped by this place since we were in Downtown Scottsdale.  We ordered a large regular pepperoni pizza with a large spinach with strawberry vinaigrette.  Both were very good!!  The large salad fed 3 of us and we had some left over to take home.  The large pizza we thought was too much was not because we just couldn't stop eating it.  We will for sure stop here again when in downtown Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"best pizza in las vegas. im a fan of ny style thin crust pizza and this place definately does it the best. ive tried roccos, familia pizzeria but i think grimaldis tops them all.  the salads are fresh and tasty and the cheesecake is decadent!  service is comparable to a fine dining restaurant"}
{"text":"Good pizza that's pretty big - I was headed to the airport and had to force the last slices down so as not to waste them!  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is always our first choice for carry out pizza. It's a little pricey but tasty! I've dined in also with friends and been just as satisfied. Was a little disappointing to have to wait an hour and a half to go pick it up. Didn't quite understand that......"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's pizza is awesome. One of my favorite pizza's in AZ! Nice thin crust pizza that's oven baked pizza with a nice scenery as well."}
{"text":"Great service (Keith) and great pizza!!! We ordered a small pizza and a small Anti pasta salad for two and left with a doggie bag. Prices were very reasonable. Wish they had one in Northern Cali, we would definitely be regulars!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Grimaldis for a few years now.  This is probably my 20th visit,  give or take.   The pizza is really the best.   No joke,  it's the best pizza in town.   Their salads are great as well.   The service has been great every time.   I have nothing bad to say about Grimaldis.   Let's face it,  I come back because of the food and service."}
{"text":"Great place. Loved the vibe and everyone who works there. The food was amazing, you can make your own thin crust pizza. Wonderful experience! Definitely coming back again"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and it was good! The location was easy to find (thanks to the concierge) and around the area are small shopping places.  Right off the bat the guy took our drink order and even catered to our 10 month old. And by catered I mean water cup with a lid and straw, high chair and even a pizza dough to place with! So the service was awesome (: Now the food, we ordered a Caprese & large Caeser Salad, Large Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza and a dessert Trio (you choose which one you want): Baileys cheesecake, Tiramisu and a Canolli.  First of the Caeser salad was freaking AMAZING! the large was big enough to be shared by four people and have enough to get seconds for everyone. The Caprese was alright, what threw me off is the basil they were using. Either its gone bad and that's why its such a dark green or I've never tasted real basil before. Anyways, the large pizza was more than enough for four people. My mother & father in law were saying that the sausage had a little kick to it so my 5 year old sister in law couldn't/wouldn't eat it. Other than that, I thought it was alright. Never really tasted an \"authentic\" pizza so I don't have much to go off on. Now the dessert ... EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! It's nice that they have an option/bundle to try some dessert with decent portion.    ***Again, everything we got was more than enough for four people and a toddler."}
{"text":"The pizza was very bland and a bit burnt around the crust. The main problem is the crust. It was cardboard like, flavorless and just not fluffy of that makes sense. Crust is an important part of the pizza and they need to get that right. Get a recipe or something. Also the toppings fell off too easily. All I know is that I've had much better. However, the service was excellent, especially the hostess. That's why I give it an extra star, but the service isn't enough to bring me back. It has to be the food, good food!"}
{"text":"Just tried Grimaldi's at Boca Park in Vegas.  Waiter was extremely cool, though we could've done without his encouraging the loud group next to us to be even louder.    Ordered a large pie with garlic and mushrooms.  As another reviewer pointed out, the first slice was the best; Grimaldi's really needs to invest in some kind of serving plate that does a better job (or any job) of keeping the pie warm.  Pizza was just what you want from a thin-crust style, however incredibly, and I mean INCREDIBLY under-seasoned.  Even with the visible garlic on it, we still needed to douse ours with extra garlic powder, cheese, oregano, red pepper flakes and whatever other seasoning we could find.  Only then was the seasoning adequate.    My wife and I did finish the whole pie, but the last slices were sadly cold, and my wife pointed out as well that there were bare patches on the pie where there was nothing: no cheese, sauce or toppings.  That is a cardinal sin in our opinion.    Had cannoli for dessert, they were quite good."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but WAY over priced. Then you have to pay for extra toppings. Seems a bit much, especially if everyone enjoys something different."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the staff was very nice. The only complaint was the crust was burned on half, so the crust had a bitter taste. The banana cream cheesecake was also yummy!!"}
{"text":"Shared an excellent prpperoni and mushroom pizza with a friend here yesterday....it was very good!!"}
{"text":"I used to like the pizza here pretty well. The last few visits the pizza lacked the right amount of tomato sauce, which is one of the important ingredients for a good pizza. The pizza we received seemed to have the tomato sauce painted onto the crust, so it was like having the cheese and meat pizza placed onto a piece of cardboard rather than one with good Italian flavor that includes a good amount of tomato sauce.  We won't be going back again after this experience. The price is too high for a pizza that doesn't measure up to a made well Italian pizza. Gilbert location is always pretty noisy, so it's hard to converse with people sitting right next to you."}
{"text":"One nibble everyone knows the laws! We try them all until we've had them all! I love their sauce, very simple, fresh, sweet taste of basil, coal fired oven on the crust, huge fan of this fancy pizza... Tuxedo Pizza 7.2!"}
{"text":"Family, Red Rock Canyon, and now Grimaldi's--three reasons I will endure the drive to Vegas.    We couldn't come up with a good reason to drag a baby out to dinner when her bedtime was just minutes away, so my nephew suggested pizza.  He mentioned it was New York pizza, and I expected that generic sort of Ray's slice, dripping with grease, but redolent of home.  Wow, was I impressed!  We had red pepper and onion, and sun-dried tomato and something...I'm not a sun dried tomato fan.   Nephew asked if it had my seal of approval, and I mentioned it tasted like Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.   Then he showed me the box.  I was in heaven.  Only downside was, we were staying at a hotel with no refrigerator that I could cram the leftovers in.  I would have happily had a slice cold, for breakfast the next day.  I can't wait for another road trip now!  There's nothing in San Diego that can compare to these pies!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is the only place outside of New York that I enjoy eating pizza. Being from NYC I am a pizza snob, but I must admit I enjoy Grimaldi's pizza.  This was my first visit to this location, and I was not disappointed.  A friend and I went to catch up, share some laughs and have some comfort food. We ordered a few glasses of educated guess (Cabernet Sauvignon), a Caesar salad and a large pizza. Half meatball and onion . . . The other half pepperoni and garlic.  Always a comfortable environment, service was solid and the pizza was yummy! I almost forgot . . . We closed out the night with a few cannolis, coffee and one more glass of wine!! I am guilty of the wine . . . My friend ordered coffee. Ha!  Thanks Monique (our sever) for a great night. Until next time Grimaldi's!!!"}
{"text":"Based on my experience here last night, this is not the place to come for gluten-free pizza. I called in advance to make sure they had a gluten-free option and when I got here ordered the white pizza on gluten-free crust. The cheese was rubbery, dry and tasteless, and the crust was burnt. The server was pleasant and efficient but even his pleasant demeanor couldn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"So, so, so good! Love this place. The best thin crust pizza I've ever had. Always go with the pepperoni (very good, little spicy) and ricotta cheese. Friendly service as well."}
{"text":"So this place definetly lived up to the hype! I was given the opportunity to order pizza for work so I gave it a go. We essentially created our own pizza, they do not list specialty pizzas so you pick your own. It was very flavorful and had fresh toppings on a light crispy crust baked in a coal oven. The one thing I was puzzled by was when we asked for butter they said they did not have for the bread but did give us oil and balsamic as a substitute. We stopped in to pick it up and I was very impressed with the ambiance it's as if you were in another city. I would highly reccomend dining in."}
{"text":"I have never posted a review on any restaurant before. Until tonight. Even though our family had a 15 minute wait, the service we received from the door being opened for us to the fabulous greetings when seated by the host, to the very attentive OUSTANDING service we received from Bryna. I am a server myself and was so pleased with our waitress. She actually cared if we were happy. You don't see that type of customer service nowadays,very genuine. Five stars from me and will make this our regular Friday dinner place. Thanks Bryna!!!   Jude"}
{"text":"We had Ashlee as our waitress and she we awesome. I'm pretty sure she came by our table 15 times in the hour that we were here. Drink service was great too. Had an Old Fashioned and a Manhattan. The drinks were good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The atmosphere was great and so was the food. Had a great time and will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time and the food is great. I could eat a whole large pep all by myself it's so delish. The only reason, they don't get a 5 star is because everytime we go there (a lot ) I feel rushed. Rushed in and rushed out. Maybe its cause I'm a family of 6 & they want more people to serve, but we are good tippers, & friendly. I get the vibe like \"oh, its them again\".  Pizza is great though!!!"}
{"text":"My very favorite pizza ever ever EVER. Always crappy service. But the manager made it up to us. I feel bad for losing my cool for a second, but wasn't going to complain to begin with--someone must have mentioned how unhappy we were with the issues we were having. We will never stop going to Grimaldi's, no matter how stupid their wait staff is  The food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This place is in my top 3 of pizza places on the West Coast - amazing !!  I bought personal pizza's - one sausage, one meatball - the crust had the charring and blistering that i like to see ...it could've been a little crispier, but  stayed rigid when i lifted up a slice - the sauce ...nice tanginess to it and i like that they added a few basil leaves....the cheese...very creamy in texture ...very good and the toppings - tasty....i enjoy metro pizza  and i like settebelo's ( sp ) though i have not been there in many months - i will need to try several times before i decide how it ranks next to my other favs - bianco's in phoenix and bollini's in so cal but i can tell you this - it's off to a great start !!!  http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r37/keithand/grimaldis003.jpg http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r37/keithand/grimaldis002.jpg http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r37/keithand/grimaldis001.jpg"}
{"text":"I've now tried this Grimaldi's three times.  My last visit with the gf and sis.  We tried, a small white pizza with mushrooms and basil, a large pepperoni and sausage with extra basil and their house salad.  A couple peroni's on tap and the bill totals $56.  I've been to the other Grimaldi's in the valley and this location is comparable as to the look and the service - both decent.  The small salad at $5 is decent - can easily serve 2 people.  The pizza ?  Well, i've been a fan of the Grimaldi chain since trying it a few years ago but geez, after trying the pizza at the Cosmo, i now find Grimaldi's pizza to be .... BORING.  I have to hit the Cosmo again very soon to make sure my taste buds are in check.    Overall, Grimaldi's is ok and i'm glad it's relatively close to my house so i'm sure i'll visit again."}
{"text":"Pizza is so good! We have been going to grimaldis pizza for years and its really one of the best pizzas in town. We love that it doesn't make us feel like we ate a pound of bread just to enjoy pizza. The crust is always perfect not thick but not too thin and the pepperoni is awesome. They have a mediteranian salad that is also very good. We even had a surprise party in the back room that they have.  Everyone there was so nice and the manager and our server made sure that the party went perfectly. Everyone at the party was impressed by how great the food and service was.  They have reasonable party style menus and can pretty much accommodate any special requests. I love that they dont try to squeeze every penny that they can from you just to have a party.  We will continue to eat here and any party in the future will definitely be at grimaldis!"}
{"text":"In town on business and got a personal pepperoni and mushroom pizza to go. It was delicious! Larger than the advertised 12\" size, thin crispy crust with just the right amount of \"chew.\" Appeared to have hand cut pepperoni and fresh mozzarella. Generous toppings for the money. Will visit again."}
{"text":"So I've been to this location at least a dozen times over the last several years, and my family I have noticed a trend during the last few visits, and it's not a good trend. The quality of the pizza is going downhill.  We went to celebrate my birthday, and because they have an email sign up offer which rewards you with a free pizza on your birthday, it was a no-brainer that we would probably go around my birthday, to celebrate and redeem it.  We started with a few salads for the table, no complaints there. We also ordered 2 large pizzas. Our server was friendly, but he was not very good about checking back after he took the order and brought out the salad and drinks. In fact we never heard from him again until one of the pizza showed up almost 25 minutes later. We tracked down a manager to ask about the second pizza, and we were told it would be right out. Since some people in our group don't like the topping on the first pizza, it felt weird to start eating without them. Literally 10 minutes went by, no second pizza, and no staff member to explain the delay?  Ok, that can happen, would have been nice if someone explain what the real time frame was going to be. Either way, that wasn't the real problem.  The quality of the pizzas are what really struck us as odd. On my last visit, with just a few family members, we commented within our group how we thought the pizzas were sloppily made, way too much sauce, soggy, very little cheese, and not the way we are used to it at Grimaldi's.  Well this visit we had a larger group (7 of us) and everyone in the party agreed that the pizzas were horrible. Again, too much sauce, and both were very soggy. It was gross.   We also thought something was off with the sauce. Everyone adult as well as our 10 year old all agreed that the sauce was much sweeter than usual, maybe there was too much basil or something in the recipe that day? You need to be consistently great, as that's what people expect from a name like Grimaldi's. Once you lose the quality control, and stop paying attention to the small (yet critical) details, it's all over  Because I've seen this trend over the last few visits, I think they need a real overhaul with their food prep and management, or it won't be worth going back, even with a free pizza."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza! We got half red & half white sauce, with sausage, mushrooms, olives. It was delicious! Our waiter was very friendly & took the time to explain the menu since it was our first time there. Too bad we are 800+ miles from home or I'd be there every week! Hopefully they open a restaurant in Northern California!"}
{"text":"Everything about our visit was excellent. Our first trip there, but went with friends who had been there. Our server, Brian was a blast and the food and wine/beer was yummy. Will be back many times."}
{"text":"The pizza was bad. The problem begins with ordering. The menu gives a few choice of sauce plus a lot of topping. It does not offer any guidance how to create a good pizza. A few signature pizza on the menu would be a welcomes improvement.   The price adds up quickly with multiple toppings.   I would recommend any fast food joints over this place."}
{"text":"Went here for pizza last night.. was pretty good, liked the crust a lot. Not as great as chicago but I'll probably be back here"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Won't eat pizza anywhere else. Not just this Grimaldis but every single one is tremendous ?"}
{"text":"Not our first time here but it always good. The staff is very friendly. The pizza is yhe best I've had."}
{"text":"If you're going here expecting a gut-bomb Chicago pizza you'll be dissapointed.  If you're looking for a classic NY coal-oven pie with high quality ingredients....this is your place.  I've been told by folks born and bred in Brooklyn that this location is even better than the original institution back east.  Try a pie with sundried tomatos and rigotta cheese....order two while you're at it.  Be warned: because of the thin, ultra-crispy crust, it does not lend itself to delivery or take-out."}
{"text":"Looking for pizza?  How about Stromboli?  Look no further if your in the Fashion show.  Great location with  good people watching.  Prices are reasonable and they have a full bar!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch after many recommendations from friends. Ramiro is always comparing NY pizza to local pizza and is never satisfied with local. But for once he said this pizza was comparable to a NY pizza, he loved that you could taste the freshness in the sauce and the cheese was also great.   I completely agree with his assessment but feel that the sauce although very fresh was lacking in spice/flavor. In addition, there was very little of it on the pizza to the point I had to request additional.   But that was my only disappointment and wouldn't make it a deal breaker as it was very tasty, ya just gotta make sure to order extra sauce.   So we will definitely be back, especially since I saw they had a meatball pizza that looks so good and I can't wait to try it."}
{"text":"When you sit at the bar, you can catch a glimpse of the afternoon fashion show.  I have never tried the NY version, but maybe it's just as great.  I wouldn't know.  I can taste the fresh ingredients and I know this isn't your typical Domino's or Pizza Hut.  The cheesy goodness is there as well as the sauce.  It's pretty good with some Blue Moon, but hey, it's just normal standard bar food for me.  So, it's good. Just good for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place deserves a 6 when it comes to the food.  It's always a shame when you want extra veggies but no matter how w try to communicate when ordering it almost never happens. Today i had a personal pan for $9 and paid an extra $6 for veggies. 2X mushrooms and black olives. The mushrooms that came on the pizza look like it would barely suffic a single order."}
{"text":"Fantastic margarita pizza, one of the best I've had anywhere (including NY). Highly recommend it, I might have to go back for another before I leave town."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in Vegas. Period! Whether you like pesto pizza, white pizza, (which is delicious. My favorite on their menu) traditional red sauce pizza, or calzones, Grimaldi's has the best of them all. Price isn't bad either. $10 for a small calzone (which is huge) and the pizzas start at $9 or $10 for a personal size pizza (which is big enough) and go up depending on how many toppings you want.   The service is always great here, and they even have pizza dough for kids to play with instead of traditional kid menus!   Boyfriend wanted me to add that the spicy chicken sausage is awesome and it actually is spicy. (And he's an authentic Mexican so he knows his spice lol)"}
{"text":"Pros:  - Great crust! The flavor of the Brooklyn Bridge pizza was good, but we felt like it was too heavy on the ricotta. Less would have made the pizza even better.  - Enjoyed the salad. The greens were crisp and fresh.   Cons:  - Slow service"}
{"text":"Usually they make a great pizza 7-9 out of 10. They actually use special filtered water that has a specific pH level which makes a difference in the dough. Their cheese also stands out against the competition as well. Not sure where they get it or if they make it from scratch as well. For a chain establishment they stand out."}
{"text":"My husband and I were homesick. We recently moved to Nevada from NY and... in search of the NY style pizza we were craving we stumbled on Grimaldi's! Now, it's our weekly spot and we order takeout every time family is in town. They agree, tastes just like home!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great as expected but what I didn't realize would knock my socks off was the quality and taste of their simple Caesar salad. I love this salad and more often than not I feel places botch up their versions with too heavy of a dressing. Grimaldi's perfects it with just the right amount of cheese, creaminess and zest. It's my definition of a perfect Caesar. Too bad I don't live by a Grimaldi's but next time I'm in Vegas I will surely seek it out!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and received outstanding customer service and great wine & pizza. First time customers and we brought an out of state guest, we were all impressed. We will return and ask for Brandon, he was very professional and polite."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago originally, but have spent the last 18 years living in San Francisco and LA.  In this time, I have yet to find a truly great slice of thin pizza in either place.    The closest I've come is Pazzia, an Italian Trattoria in San Francisco (which doesn't really count because it's not a 'by the slice' pizzeria) and Casa Bianca in LA.  Nothing else is truly noteworthy.  The wife and I went to Phoenix a few weeks ago to look at real estate.  While there, I wanted to try some NY/Chicago food because there's a huge influence there.  This led us to Yelp...  which led us to Grimaldi's.  Let me tell you something...   bomb.  Good crust, good sauce, good cheese, quality meats.  Excellent.  I was very happy.    Plus, there are certain types of salad dressings that just feel like Chicago or NY.  Grimaldi's has that too.  I think they're sweeter and less acidic or something.  Anyway, if you don't like Grimaldi's, then you just don't get it when it comes to pizza.  Grimaldi's, please open a location in LA."}
{"text":"The pizza was a 10 but the salad we ordered was 99 percent lettuce, one tomato one olive and some mushrooms for two adults I couldn't find much more but plenty of delicious lettuce for $7 great for a rabbit.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Ate at Grimaldi's in Garden City NY a few months ago, and it was fantastic.  I'd like to tell you San Tan Village Grimaldi's is also great, but they neglect to inform their customers they shut down  the ovens for 2 hours every day, so you can't get food from 3-5pm.  Business hours on their website note 11am -11pm which is a bit misleading.  You're starting in the hole Grimaldi's.  Hoping the food and service are better than your website management,."}
{"text":"Nicely cooked crisp pizza. Thin like a NY style. Good ambiance, dark, noisy with lots of TV's showing the games. Nothing really stood out though although it was good. I would return and if you are in the area, eat here too. But don't travel across town."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and calzones.  the crust is so crispy and the sauce is great.  I'm from the east coast and this really feels like I'm back there"}
{"text":"Great crust! They have 3 locations in Arizona.  I was checking out Old Town Scottsdale and decided to eat here since I heard about it on Oprah.   I arrived just when it opened for lunch so there was no wait.  Besides the pizza, I also had their Caesar salad and cannolis for dessert.   The cannolis were good!"}
{"text":"Having been to the location in Old Town and having enjoyed we decided to come here last night for a quick dinner.  Arrived at around 6:30pm and the place was about half full.  Great, we thought!  Nope, \"there will be a short wait Sir\".  Really, why?  Oh well, we were seated less than 5 minutes later so everything was fine.  Our server was polite but seemed awkward.  She struggled to smile, strange?  We ordered the Caprese Salad and 2 pizzas.  Pizzas were good but overpriced IMO.  Charging $4 for Sun Dried Tomatoes is a bit much and $2 for Garlic?  Hey, it is what it is but I'm just pointing it out.  Overall we agreed that it was good but not somewhere we'll go running back to.  Really need to try LAMP up the street next time."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Grimaldi's, they have great NY style pizza in the valley."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best pizza in town! I would recommend this pizza to anyone who prefers a higher end pie! Brick over and in house pepperoni and sausage...."}
{"text":"The worst pizza, I have ever had.  Over priced and just not edible.  I wouldn't recommend wasting your time or money here."}
{"text":"Had a very enjoyable evening at the bar.  Hanging out at the quarter relaxing drinking some wine and some thin sliced pizza.  Gets crowded and takes time to get a table so nice to grab a bar seat."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's never disappoints.  Great food, great service, and very reasonable prices for the quality of the food and the service.  It's a hidden gem, and that's part of what makes it so great.  You can actually get away from the racket that pervades now days.  If this place were not so out of the way, it would be mobbed constantly."}
{"text":"One of my favorites pizza joints!! Pepperoni, meatball, fresh basil cooked golden brown yum!!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, it is a little expensive but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the restuarants at the Palazzo. Feels and tastes like NY pizza. They have a good wine list, the salads and antipastos are good. The pizza is good too. Maybe I'm missing the new york water lol. Try the pesto pizza with sun dried tomatoes and the white pizza with ricotta."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious!!!! Try the Caesars salad. You can share the large salads...Everything was fresh. The restaurant was clean. Not crowded!!! The prices are reasonable...Definitely a place for lunch or dinner!!!  They only offer pizzas, calzones, and salads... No pasta dishes!!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here back in December.  I love the pizza and salads here.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Try the one in Brooklyn, NY."}
{"text":"It is very nice to find a good pizza shop whenever you're away from home and this is just the place.  I have been to a Grimaldi's in San Antonio so I knew exactly what I was getting into.  The pizza here is pretty good and definitely does your \"run of the mill\" NYC pizza justice.  The toppings selection is pretty varied but be careful because you can end up ordering a very pricy pizza if you decide to get crazy with the toppings.  For transplanted New Yorkers like myself who want a piece of home, this place is perfect to get your pizza fix."}
{"text":"We ate here for Lunch, and were throughly impressed.  The 12 inch personal pizzas were filling & full of flavor. The chicken sausage has a flavorful kick making it a must! That crust is out of this world! Stop in if your at The Palazzo!"}
{"text":"It's all about the value and taste with this Vegas affordable eatery!   Large 16'' pie with meatball feeding my family of four for $20.   That's $5 a piece for feeding all of my family ... Not 4 burgers for $71 plus tax and drinks and fries etc.   Vegas will reach into your pockets for everything and anything you want when it comes to separating you from your money.  Finding a place like this that will feed a family of four for 20 bucks is a rare treat in this city!"}
{"text":"So a small's a (large 16in) and a Large is an (extra-large 18in) Very good pie, easily one of the top 5 in the valley, Ordered a small pepp, and sausage... Came out great..... Cost was 19.85 and well worth it!Authentic New York, fold style pizza....:) Will definitely be back........."}
{"text":"We were driving back from Idaho and happen to come across the Grimaldi's on Yelp. There are multiple Las Vegas locations but this one is on the Fashion Show mall. We wanted to go to the Grimaldis in Brooklyn in June but didn't make it happen. This is the next best thing when in Las Vegas. We got the basic margherita pizza with the famous tomato sauce and basil. It is the simplest pizza you can get but it allows you to focus on taste of the crust and the sauce. I recommend just getting a large for your best value and leftovers pizza is always good. I honestly would like a lot of toppings but they really add up and I would have a $30 plus pizza. You don't expect food to be cheap in Vegas though. I can't compare to the Brooklyn location but I am guessing it's much easier to get a table in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza restaurant! They have the best crust. They filter the water to make it the same mineral content as the water in New York. They believe this is what makes their dough the best. Their crust is thin and has the right amount of crunch and chew. They use a 1200 degree oven. We brought our friends from Canada here and told them it was my favorite and they loved it too. They also enjoyed watching the kitchen where they throw and spin the dough. There is also a nice view of the Palazzo chandeliers over the entrance and escalators."}
{"text":"Delicious and filling. You can't get this flavor anywhere else in Las Vegas. There's so much food that you can split everything and still have room for their wonderful drink selection..."}
{"text":"First of al thank you to Kaitlyn and Jennifer for the warm greeting when we walked in they truly make you feel welcome when you walk in. Next thank you to Mike our waiter for being so professional and friendly. NEXT AND MOST IMPORTANT the food is beyond amazing hands down the best pizza in vegas, I used to think it was the pizza at the cosmo but this place does not leave you feeling heavy and tired. The manager makes sure to come by and make sure you enjoyed your self which is so important. Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great pizza & staff and I never leave disappointed (or hungry).  Keep  up the good work."}
{"text":"Fabulous service, great pizza, and a happy time spent eating with my husband! Always a must do place to visit while in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We had the Brooklyn Bridge to go and the ricotta really makes it a delicious pizza. Unfortunately, the crust was a little doughy, possibly because of the ricotta, so I recommend you order it extra crispy. Otherwise a great pizza."}
{"text":"Always fresh, great service(ask for Kevin). I enjoy this place very much. Fun for family or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic! One of my favorite places to dine in Vegas. Not only is the pizza incredible, the customer service is exceptional. I would happily pay a little more for the quality of food and service they provide, no questions asked!  These servers truly go out of their way to create an experience for each customer. This has been the case every single time I have been. The servers always maintain a positive and inviting demeanor, and you can sense that they truly enjoy their job. The kind of passion and charisma they exhibit consistently is rare. Well done!"}
{"text":"When I'm not on a strict diet, I love to go to Grimaldi's for their coal-fired pie. Just like little bites of heaven."}
{"text":"the place for pizza.. NYC style.. we added garlic and pesto hitted big with the flavor of the pizza.. if u guys have guess over.. the place to go for an awesome event"}
{"text":"The food was great!   It was busy,  and Cody (curly hair, great smile, and great personality) was doing his best to make sure he attended to our needs.  It was a busy afternoon, and they were a bit understaffed.  My experience was a positive and good one.  I would go back again!"}
{"text":"Was here last Sunday and we've been coming here for dinner with the family a few times now. Always a great place to enjoy pizza and wine. Last time we were in, they got our pizza in wrong and service was a little slower even though it was a busy night...that was the only down fall. Otherwise I'd highly recommend people to come back."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of our favorite spots for pizza, but tonight we waited 45 minutes for our takeout pizza...then they forgot our salad. When we arrived they said our order wasn't quite ready yet...don't lie to your customers if you forgot an order? Also, an employee said he would check on our order and never returned. Someone else delivered our food and didn't even apologize for the wait. Just a tip, if you don't meet expectations you should try to make up for it. Disappointed."}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday evening about an hour before close.  There were a few other tables and some people came in after us too.  The waitress was friendly and attentive and explained the pizzas since it was our first time there.    We ordered the Large (18\") regular cheese pizza for $16.  It was thin and crispy yet still chewy.  There was just dough, a little sauce, and some slices of fresh mozzarella.  They don't use shredded cheese (at least on the pizza we ordered).  The sauce was good, not spicy (herbs, etc) just plain & a nice balance of sweet and sour, which I like.  They do offer you oregano and garlic powder when your pizza comes out.  I would have liked more cheese since I'm not used to seeing sauce through the cheese, but it was still good.  The pizza came out to us very quickly after ordering.  One thing to note, because it is so thin it gets cold fast.  Minus 1 star because it is a little pricey for just a little cheese and sauce (add $2 - $4 for toppings, and half toppings are charged for a full topping).  Although it does taste fresh so the quality is good."}
{"text":"Even though every time we come here it is great. It is time for another review.  If you are looking for Pizza in the Valley it can sometimes be a challenge. Good pizza is hard to find. Although I have noticed that there is a big change lately, with much better Pizza around. However, Grimaldi's has always been good. It is still really good. This time around we came on a Saturday night.  Of course they were busy,but we were seated right away. Although it was the table right by the Kitchen. I kind of did not want to sit there. But, I was so glad we did.   We had the pleasure of watching the Pizza being made. It was so cool to see the guys throw the dough up in the air, and spin it around till it got bigger and bigger. Just like in the movies. They were so fast ,they must of made 100 pizzas while we were there,or at least 50. Hehee But, the Pizza was divine. The crust was light and airy. the toppings were perfect. We created our own Pizza this time, (the toppings).  We had wine and ice tea, as well as 2 really great salads.  Check out the photos. I have to say the Manager is really great here. Which is probably a good reason that this restaurant is so successful! He goes around to every table checking on everyone. He even brings out food , refills drinks,takes away used dishes. These are all the signs of a great leader .And no, I don't know him. It is just an observation of someone doing a great job. We really enjoy our time here.If I had guests from out of town I would be happy to bring them here."}
{"text":"We took the kids out for lunch and had the best meal and service today!  Our salads were fresh and chilled.  So good.  For our pizza we got half cheese and half garden  w/ artichoke. It came out hot and just perfect.  We didn't have any leftovers!   The kids loved the blueberry lemonade which was off their special summer menu.  We splurged and ordered the dessert trio which was tiramisu, a cannoli and cheesecake (we got Oreo flavored).   Great job Grimaldi's. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Many years ago, I visited the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. While the pizza at this location isn't quite as tasty (it is close), the service and atmosphere are far superior. Easily one of my favorite pizza places and they also have other items on their menu. I have been to this location and ordered carry out probably a dozen times and the pizza is always great. I highly recommend visiting and you can drop in, though groups should make a reservation. There is also a full bar for drinks or to hang out at while you wait for carry out. Of course the highlight is the pizza, true to the Brooklyn / Manhattan style and made in coal brick oven."}
{"text":"-This place has totally redeemed its name from my previous visit to the Boca Park location. Amazing pizza, to make a long story short, and a pretty decent beer selection. Even more so in the wine department, unfortunately I have not totally educated my pallate in alot of red varietals, but I know any wino would appreciate such a vast collection. Chinedu (I hope I spelled that right) was more than willing to help me find a suitable wine, but we were kind of in a rush to visit a friend and see a show. Got to shake hands with Joe, the regional manager, if I recall correctly. The man knows what he is doing when it comes to expanding. This will definitely be a new pizza spot for me, especially because they have traditional, white and pesto options.. not to mention it is so close to my work. Thumbs up, all the way around... Congrats on the new and soon to come locations :)"}
{"text":"We've been to Grimaldi's in NY and two in Nevada,  and were really looking forward to visiting the new location at fashion show mall.  It was great to see the sign to the left of the runway in the mall. The ambiance was consistent with other locations. We got a large Caesar salad and a large pizza with garlic,Italian sausage, and pepperoni. Ono! (delicious in Hawaiian).  Making the experience complete was our server, Javier, who was friendly, prompt, and just an overall great guy.  On our next visit, we will stop by and personally ask for him...he's that good. Great job grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"i love this place . the pizza is very fresh and crispy  and always great food and nice service..just only one thing .it took long time..at least wait 20min.. their sun dried tomato is amazing.our whole family love to go there."}
{"text":"My brother also posted about our Mother's Day experience. These must be franchises because the Scottsdale and Chandler locations are like eating at a different restaurant entirely. This is the second and last time we will frequent this location. The pizza and calzones were awful."}
{"text":"Excellent New York style pizza.   You have to try the blueberry cheesecake.   A little pricey than most but worth the extra expense"}
{"text":"I used to go to Grimaldi's all the time, but not anymore.  The last time I went to Grimaldi's, I did not have a pleasant experience.  I went there with one of my friends, and we ordered a pizza together along with some drinks.  After we had our pizza in front of us, I asked for some ranch.  Oh, I should not have asked.  They made such a big deal, as if I insulted their cooking.  I'm just a girl who happens to like ranch and pizza, no matter how good it is.  Am I not allowed to have my own likes and dislikes?  Anyway, they refused to give me ranch with my pizza and claimed it's because it drowns out the true flavor of the pizza.  So what??  Their job isn't to tell me how I SHOULD like my food based on their own preferences.  This was a truly awkward and uncomfortable experience, when it should have been a fun and pleasant night with a good friend.  I couldn't even enjoy my pizza, because I felt like I was being judged the rest of my meal there, just for asking a simple question.  I'd rather make my own pizza at home, than to feel treated like that again."}
{"text":"Not impressed...!  Pizza overcooked - crust a bit burnt.  Caprizi salad was skimpy.  Service Ok"}
{"text":"My family and I moved from upstate NY to AZ last year and had a hard time finding good pizza. We love it here. They serve other Italian food as well."}
{"text":"So, I love most Grimaldi's locations. I've been to 3 total over the United States. I always order the same thing a pizza with red sauce with pepperoni, spicy chicken sausage and jalapeños. Let me just say, for a pizza restaurant, they are expensive. A personal sized pizza with red sauce and the aforementioned toppings will run you about $18. That's 6 slices of pizza.  It's expensive but the taste is really good and the quality of the toppings and ingredients are good so when you're on the road and want a good slice of pizza it's worth it to get quality. I have been to this location in the Fashion Show mall here in Vegas about 5 times in the last 2 years. Twice, in the last week. The consensus between my friends and I are the same. This location is VERY slow. Like, sit down and wait 10 minutes before you place a drink order slow. Place a drink and meal order and wait 10 more minutes for your drink and 30-35 minutes for your pizza slow. The quality is not consistent and there doesn't seem to be any concern with any of this. The people have for the most part always been pleasant. I've only felt ignored once. Tonight I ordered my regular order and my pizza came out burnt. I didn't think the server should have even brought it out to my table, but he did. He was nice, but he didn't acknowledge it was clearly burnt. When I said something he hesitated and said it was \"just a little burnt\" and explained it just got a little too close to the coals. I tried to eat it, but the second slice in (the first wasn't really burned) I had a very strong charcoal taste in my mouth. I asked for another one and it came out, this time it wasn't burnt, but it wasn't really browned the way I'm accustomed to it being, therefore the crust and pizza was \"flimsy\". The taste was there but the experience wasn't. I paid for my check and took my pizza to go. I spent $22 before tip. Don't know if I'll be back to this location. They definitely have good food but you have to pack some patience and time to eat here. Hey, this is Vegas, if they get it right, it's definitely worth the gamble."}
{"text":"This place is clutch. We went here on our last trip to Vegas. My kids said they wanted to eat pizza their everyday. While I didn't make that happen, we did get pizza to go for them a couple other times."}
{"text":"I enjoy pizza from a coal oven and this is a good pizza. I just wish they could cook it a little longer. It should have a little color in the crust. Sausage is good and just the right amount of sauce. They were out of 3 different draft beers so there was nothing worth drinking on tap. Don't know how they let that happen."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant, they have really great pizza. My go to pizza - white garlic with sausage. My friend and I can get a large of this and finish the entire thing in one sitting! The crust is thin and chewy, while the cheese is gooey and tasty. The sausage is also very well seasoned and gives extra flavor to the pizza, offsetting the garlic bits across the pizza.  They also have seasonal cheesecakes and tiramisu. My favorite is their tiramisu, where the lady fingers are soaked with just the right amount of espresso. But in my personal opinion: ask for it without the chocolate syrup. They drizzle the syrup on the bottom of the plate and overpowers the already delicious flavors of the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Bomb pizza! Ordered a simple pepperoni and the mediterranean salad. Thought we would have some pizza for the next day but it was too good! Nice hint of smoke in the crust from the coal oven and top quality meat. Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I'm there for sure."}
{"text":"On a recent family trip to Glendale Arizona we visited Grimaldis as I had heard good things. The location is in a nice area in Peoria and restaurant looked very clean and inviting. We ordered 2 pizzas with Pepperoni and chicken sausage. The pizzas were large and very thin as a ny style pizza usually is. The crust was slightly crunchy and the taste of pizza was fantastic. From the sauce to the toppings everything was top notch. The chicken sausage was spicy so it made the pizza great. We also ordered some wine for our meal and for dessert some NY style cheesecakes. These were nice and creamy. Yum! The service was also fantastic as the servers were very attentive. The restaurant was crowded and definitely had a nice elegant vibe. Prices were a tad high but well worth it. Would definitely recommend. Will be visiting Glendale again soon and this will be one of my must stops. Thank you Grimaldis for creating a great experience for my family and i."}
{"text":"I was surprised to find Grimaldi's Pizzaria when I walked in Palazzo from the Wynn. I had no idea they even had one in Vegas, so I was pretty excited to eat here since I loved their pizza when I had it New York.  But, it wasn't the same :(.  We ordered a small pizza to share for two people. I think the water they used really makes a difference in the dough, because it wasn't as good as what I had in NYC. The first slice was good, but after the pizza has been sitting there, it starts to get soggy and kinda gross at the bottom.   It's in a nice location (it's inside the Palazzo hotel right by the entrance of the hotel where the connecting overpass for the Wynn and Palazzo is), and if you get seated in the back of the restaurant, you'd have a pretty nice view of the Wynn and Encore hotels outside.They also incorporated some of the NY touches with the brick walls and subway signs inside, but pizza is still not the same as the real deal."}
{"text":"Shopping the other day and stopped in for lunch.  I heard good things about Grimaldi's so I was curious.  The waiter was very nice and friendly.  I ordered the large Mediterranean salad to share.  The waiter was kind enough to inform us that a small salad would be plenty to share for two.  We also ordered a small pepperoni pizza to share.  They also have smaller personal pizzas if you want to go that route.  Wow, the dressing on the salad was fantastic.  I was looking around to see if they sold it in a bottle to take home.  I was too busy and involved in eating this delicious salad and forgot to ask.  Then the pizza came...  The small pizza was definitely enough for two to share.  This is the best pizza I have ever had.  No grease?? Thin crust. Pepperoni isn't even my favorite.  We managed to eat all of it except one piece.  I wanted to though, but I was too full.  I kept looking at it, contemplating.    This was a happy day!!"}
{"text":"First time there. Long wait to seat and slow service. typical for a busy Saturday evening but great pizza.  Second visit. Two tables seated after us got their pizza before us. Turns out our order was lost  (it happens) but our dinner was on them and still great pizza. Third visit. Valentines Day around 3 pm, Ovens are being cleaned and no pizza until an hour later. Talked with manager on my disappointment and left. Fourth time today 4/17. Arrived at 4:45 pm and ovens being cleaned again and no pizza till around 5:20 pm. Reason for my disappointment this time is I gave them another shot, drove out of my way because wife wanted pizza. Sorry Grimaldi's but the way you conduct business I will not return even if you offered a $100 gift certificate. Point is people go out of their way to do business with you and when a customer walks in expects to be seated, pizza ordered and food arrive in a reasonable time and not have to be informed that, sorry we can't make your pizza right now."}
{"text":"The crust was crispy and good; but that's about it.  I didn't care for their pizza at all.  I think you have to see for yourself, but it's a little different.   I didn't like the taste of the sauce or the toppings.  The garden salad was not the typical salad your used to.  It had a lot of onions and marinated peppers and olives in it.  It wasn't to my taste... Also already had a premade oil dressing mixed in.  Personally I won't be back here."}
{"text":"We've been to this location a few times and generally enjoy coming here. Their pizza is very tasty and the atmosphere is nice and inviting. It does tend to get a little bit loud in there, which would be my only negative. We usually try to avoid coming in on the weekends before 9 pm because it can get really crowded. But, that could also be seen as a testament to their quality.   Otherwise it's a good place to grab some tasty pizza and dessert. They have a decently sized selection of pizzas to choose from and have other great options too. I highly recommend the Oreo cheesecake! It's is quite delicious and I've ordered it on multiple occasions. I don't think I've ever ordered something here and not enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Call me crazy... there's something about waiting on the sidewalk for 45 minutes to an hour to have this pie in Brooklyn that just makes it taste different than walking into a virtually empty Grimaldi's in the Palazzo around 11P on a Saturday evening.   The Caesar salad was tasty and our sausage and pepperoni pizza was good but it just wasn't the same as enjoying this pizza in NY. I had a couple slices and was fine to box up the rest to bring with us. Something I would never do in NY, I'd polish the entire thing off and maybe order one for the road.  I was super stoked to see they had opened in Vegas and it's a fantastic dining option as they are open until 2A but noticeably different than their NY locations."}
{"text":"A fellow colleague took me here. Atmosphere was nice, service was top notch and the place was busy. Pizza was delicious; firebrick thin crust pepperoni pizza. Simple and delicious. Would defiantly go here again."}
{"text":"Took our seven year old grandson for a night out. The evening we were there was half price wine night, bought a half carafe of Esperto, well worth the price! Started with antipasto, always a winner. Custom pizza with garlic, roasted sweet peppers, ham, & bacon--great combo. Staff was attentive to every need--even made sure our grandsons pizza was in early and out fast. Tiramisu for desert is a must!"}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's tonight, and I thought it was fabulous!  My friend and I got the pizza of the month -- the BBQ Chicken pizza.  This was one of the best pizza's I've ever had.  The veggies were nice and crunchy, and I have to say that using fresh mozzarella makes pizza a totally different experience.  We also shared the small greek salad (which was enormous) -- we got the dressing on the side -- which I think is usually a safe bet with any kind of vinaigarette -- too much can ruin a salad.    All in all, a stellar experience.  This place *may* just take over as my fave pizza in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I heard really good things about this place....only problem it's all the way in NYC....Fortunately, I was able to find this place in Vegas so I had to try it. OMG it's hellla bomb. I guess NY style pizza really lives up to it's reputation & it's huge. We also got a large salad to split between 3 girls and still had some left over. I really wish I could eat grimaldi's everyday....FML"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. The brick oven gives the crust an amazing flavor, and the sauce is incredible (we usually add extra). Add a nice Caesar salad with some kalamata olives, and a glass of wine, and you're in for a treat."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my daughter - they were open but unable to make pizza for 45 minutes!!  Huh?  Thanks for the heads up - no need to try again with competition everywhere."}
{"text":"This is the best thin crust pizza in Phoenix..  I love the the basic pepperoni and sausage but everything I have tried is awesome."}
{"text":"I try to be very careful with giving 5 stars, but the service I received on a Saturday exceeded all my expectations. Since we had 10 people in our party, I made a reservation ahead of time. We were seated right away when we arrived. One thing I like about this location is that it seems a lot more open than it's Green Valley counterpart. (I always feel like we're squished in there.)   Our waitress was great and very patient with our large group. She also made suggestions on wines after we told her what we were looking for. We ordered two large salads to share - Caesar and Greek - and they were your classic salads you might find elsewhere. However, the pizza is what we came for and both the Brooklyn Bridge and the Four Cheese were excellent. One of the pizzas had a 2-inch hole in it which, truthfully we might not have noticed had the manager not pointed it out and told us they were making us another small size of the same pizza for that reason. On top of all that, they were quick but not suspiciously quick!"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good. It was thin crust and my wife and I easily ate the entire large pizza without hesitation. We will definitely be going back for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I came after work on a Thursday evening during the Knights Playoff game. There was no wait which was a huge plus since we were hungry and the hostess was very friendly from the moment we walked in.   We asked to sit near the TV's and she asked if we wanted a high top or table we chose table and it was the perfect setting. Our waitress Monica was super friendly and fast. She allowed us to sample a few wines which was really cool. We ended up getting 2 glasses of vino and a large Don Pizza. Everything was absolutely delicious and the pizza was cooked perfectly. Monica checked in on us to ensure everything was good which was a plus for me and even ensured our water glasses were full.  Even though it was just my husband and I it is a very friendly family restaurant and atmosphere. I've dined here before but tonight's experience was amazing and I couldn't pass on writing a tremendous review.   When leaving the hostess even opened the door for my husband and I & wished a nice evening!! The service, food and people are spectacular here and I will DEFINITELY return!"}
{"text":"Holy frijoles- this place lived up to the hype. I'm surprised how how good the pizza is here in Arizona. Very tasty, and definitely some of the best pizza I've had in the valley. The only downside is that there is usually a long wait to be seated, and then once your seated, it takes a longer wait for your pizza. The prices are average, the service was so-so, but the food was excellent! Nice location too, right in Old Town so you can have a drink at a nearby bar while you wait for your table. Cool place for date-night, or to have dinner with family. It's fairly casual, but charming at the same time."}
{"text":"I'm a native of NYC and have been to the Brooklyn Grimaldi's several times. Yes, it is totally worth the wait on line outside in the cold under the Brooklyn Bridge. And I am so happy that there is one here in Las Vegas! No line!!! They have figured out the water issue by removing and adding minerals so the water is line NYC water, so the dough turns out right. The mozzarella cheese is delish and the space is nice. The cannoli for desert is just right!  I think now that we have found a pizza place to get our FIX in Las Vegas we can rest easy and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's redeems the coal industry. I know what you're thinking; when I heard they had a coal-fired oven, the first thing that came to mind was dirty coal and the energy industry. Well, I don't know how this oven works but, what I do know is that the pizza that comes out of it is amazing. The crust might be the best of any chain restaurant (sorry, Grimalid's, with as many locations as you've got, you can't deny being a pizza chaing). Don't let the fact that the place is a chain dissuade you from checking it out. The ingredients that grace the crust are phenomenal. Their meats are devine and their veggies crunchy and fresh. Definitely worth trying if you like a good pie."}
{"text":"So I was expecting a lot when I walked in the door here and sadly I have to say that it failed to meet those expectations. This place seems on the outside to be a top notch pizza place that makes it's pizza in a coal brick oven like some of the best joints out there. However the truth soon becomes apparent once you order your pizza and then wait forever. The waitress was very nice and I felt bad for her because the kitchen was quite frankly letting her down big time when it came to getting things out of the oven. The pizza took around an hour to get after ordering... yes an hour for a coal fired pizza! The pizza comes and smells okay but doesn't knock your socks off aroma wise and taste wise was really bland. Even the crust which was the best part of it was very bland... it lacked flavor. The other issue was a lack of toppings and sauce. The sauce was missing something and was only lightly dabbled in spots on the pizza and for supposedly real cheese (what little was on it) it was tasteless. Being a lover of pizza I was highly saddened by this place that seemed to have soo much potential. Pricewise you expect more for what you are paying and everyone in my group was very depressed with the quality. I don't however think the place is beyond redemption and if they would make some changes to add some real flavor they could have a nice place here. However I won't be going back anytime soon unless I hear they have made some changes. I think the only reason this place has been able to make so far is because of its location at the San Tan Marketplace and not really on the merits of its food. You end up really wanting to like the place but it just doesn't happen. I would suggest if you want a good pizza for around the same price point check out  Venezia Pizza..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place by far in Las Vegas. We always get the pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom and it's always delicious!! I think the pizza is better when you eat it there though. It is the best when it comes directly out of the brick oven.   The wait staff is always friendly and the service is always good and fast. However, we had a guy tonight who kept forgetting about our drinks and what we asked for. It was pretty busy there so it's not a big deal. Service is usually always great there.   This is definitely a place to try if you want excellent pizza!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food, service, and atmosphere are incredible. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Being from NYC, I know pizza.  I grew up 1 block over from Little Italy and 3 blocks from Lombardi's.  I love italian food.  I love the thin crust, crispy, saucey, cheesey variety.  Grimaldi's in NYC is better than Vegas.  Pizza in NYC generally speaking tastes different than anywhere else.  Most pizzeria owners that I know back home, say its the water that makes it taste different, and I actually have to agree.    Grimaldi's here make a great effort in providing NYC Style pizza.  The gf and I had a large pie with sweet red peppers, sausage and onions.  It's thin and crispy.  Saucey and cheesey however, it is not!  Seemed like they skimped on the sauce (which is their signature) and the cheese.  Especially, when the sauce and cheese are the main components of the pizza.  It was good, but not great.  Sadly, I left here unimpressed and missing NY a little more.  Atmosphere was good, they have an outdoor patio and full bar with a few flatscreens to watch the games.  Heard Giovanni's is better.  Will try Giovanni's next time I have a pizza craving.    **Make that Settebello's in Henderson**"}
{"text":"Everything was fresh. We ordered a large pizza with fresh basil and Italian sausage. The waitress didn't know that much about the pizza that most customer order. She just knew the basics. This is the reason for the 4 star. Typically, the waitress at other restaurants know their stuff.  I would highly recommend you try this place"}
{"text":"I did not like this place at all, from the moment we sat down I was uncomfortable.   All of the pizza toppings were a la carte, I wanted a vegetarian pizza and enjoy my company, instead I had a waitress staring me down... like I was wasting her time cause I had a hard time figuring out what vegetables to choose from... a large pizza with minimal toppings was $28.   They forget our salad and spilled sauce on my friend. At the end of our evening we felt like we were being kicked out, even though they were open for another hour. I will never go back there and will definitely not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Oh my god, it was like i had died and gone to pizza heaven!   Now don't get me wrong i love pizza; from the soggy microwaved, burn the roof of your mouth off to the crusty over cooked, kept warm by a heat lamp baseball pizzas. If it is made of bread, cheese and tomato sauce i am there, and i am one happy woman!!  But the pizzas at Grimaldi's well you could prop me up at the bar and keep feeding me slices of heaven until i burst like Mr Creosote (Monty Python reference there kids!!) I ordered a large (tomato sauce) pizza with mushrooms, fresh chopped tomatoes, roasted sweet red peppers and garlic...no meat for me folks sorry!! Also a caprasie (also known as a tri-colour) salad for an appetizer and a small house salad to go with my pizza.  The Caprasie salad ($7) was perfect to share and came with the dinkiest pieces of bread to top with basil, Roma tomatoes and home made mozzarella..yummy! The small house salad ($5) was again more than enough to share between two people and really complimented the pizza, the salad dressing was flavorful but didn't over power the dish.   And now we get to may favorite part the pizza, like i said i love pizzas, but this one has topped my charts! The base was beautifully cooked, it was a good thin crust hand tossed kinda base, but it was still soft and amazingly fresh tasting. They had amazingly managed to make it completely uncracker like which most wood/coal fired pizza places seem to make their bases. The \"secret\" tomato sauce was sweet with just the right amount of herbs, not over powering that it makes your eyes water, but with a damn good flavour! The toppings...well the mushrooms were beautiful, not gritty and not so small that you couldn't find them; the fresh tomatoes were sweet and juicy, the sweet red peppers...oh my god they were amazing a slight spicy flavour enhanced by the sweet roasted yumminess of the peppers! Lastly the garlic, wow wee it's a good thing I'm sitting here by myself as wow i can still taste the garlic and it's been a loooooong time since i ate it!  Well all in all it was a great experience, the total bill came to $50, and this included a half carafe of pg and 2 large glasses or Perioni beer.  So the down side, yes it did take FOREVER for the food to get served, yes the wait staff was not the jolliest i have ever encountered.....but for me the food totally makes up for it!   So on my recommendation, go to Grimaldi's order the pizza, salad, beer or wine...and just remember to carry a book and a bag of pretzels to tie you over until the really food comes out, because ladies and gentlemen it is totally worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for a less expensive dinner on the strip with the family.  Located in the beautiful Palazzo, Grimaldi's proved to be worthy of it's origins in Brooklyn.  We are from NYC, and I consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur.  I've been to the original under the Brooklyn Bridge many times.  This is easily the best pizza I've ever had outside of the NYC area.  Both the Grimaldi's and Caesar salads were excellent, nice selection of bottled and draft beers.  Then the pizza arrived, the plain cheese pizza and the white pizza were both above average with an nice thin crispy crust.  Aside from the food the service was outstanding.  Prompt, attentive, helpful, etc.  I will definitely plan on returning next time I'm on the strip."}
{"text":"So we ended up here because the link at the Mexican grille next door was too long. My husband recently had his wisdom teeth pulled, so we were hoping to find some pasta instead of just pizza. Unfortunately, it was only a pizza place, but it smelled good so we stayed. We ordered the caprese appetizer. It came with tomatoes that were hard and unripe. The cheese and basil were good, but the server brought the oil and vinegar, instead of it having any type of balsamic vinaigrette for dressing. We asked for it, but she seemed perplexed. Finally got that. Ordered a 16-inch pizza (they come with a thin crust) with onions and mushrooms. The pizza arrived quickly, probably because it was undercooked. We were surprised to see the crust on the outside was done, but underneath the toppings, the dough was raw. The mushrooms had zero flavor, as did the sauce, and the cheese was minimal and also flavorless. The onions were cut in too large pieces, and also seemed to have zero taste. We showed our server that it wasn't done, and she said it's because of the mushrooms. Really? I have mushrooms on pizza all the time, and the dough is never raw. I'm also kind of amazed she didn't tell a manger to come to our table who might address the issue. The server was nice, but might have been new because she was kind of clueless.  Ate some of the toppings but left all the crust. We ordered the blueberry cheesecake for dessert, and it was actually good.  Needless to say, we won't be back here. Joey's pizza up the hill on Eastern is WAY better, or just go to Pizza Rev where you can get exactly what you want for a great price and taste.   Not sure how this place got such good reviews on Yelp.   NOTE: I was contacted by the manager regarding our bad experience and was offered complimentary meals to try again, which we will do in the future. I won't amend this review yet. When I try it again, I will keep you posted. I will give the management credit for responding quickly and more than appropriately."}
{"text":"I've been to the place in NYC - oh no wait...I've gone to the place and have been deterred by the 2 hour line more than once. Very frustrating when all you want is to treat your out of town guests to some really amazing pizza! So when we walked by this place while cruising downtown Scottsdale, I was surprised to learn they had locations outside of the one busier-than-all-F place under the Brooklyn Bridge. So my dad and I gave it a shot.   Now I've had (several, actually) discussions with the bf on what constitutes good pizza (it's VERY subjective, but still there are universal goods and bads). And I think I can unequivocally say, this is awesome pizza! The coal-fired taste is scrumptious. It came out hot - we had onions and mushrooms. The mozz cheese was great - not rubbery, not greasy, just delicious.   We also had a small salad (the waitress tipped us off that a small was enough for 2 ppl - thanks for that! - she was right and saved us $3 and a lot of wasted salad). The salad was basic, good, and the dressing was yummy. And a half-carafe of red wine was was definitely enough for both of us (full from earlier drinks).   ONE complaint would be there isn't enough sauce (whatever sauce there was, it was tasty, but could have used 50% more!). Other than that, at $30-ish for the entire meal (!!!) I can say my dad will definitely be back since he lives there, and I will put my full support behind that! :)"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's....I've eaten here several times in the past couple of years and finally getting around to a review.  I think this place is pretty decent for pizza.  When I first tried it, I thought it was pretty amazing and after a few more visits, I think this place is ok.  Probably cause I found a true New York gem in Isa's Pizza on 40th street and bell.  The menu is pretty basic, a few salads and some pizza options.  They charge 18 for a large and 16 for a small and all topping are additional.  That's where they get you.  Cause I generally like pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms, so that additional 6 bucks just for those toppings.  Overall pretty solid New York style pizza, but  a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"First time at a Grimaldi's and will definitely be going back for more! This one's in a great location and has surrounding shopping areas. Normally, not a huge thin crust fan, but they do a good job--not so thin that it's all burnt and cracker-like. Started with the caprese salad--yum! All super fresh ingredients (all three of them). Then we got the white pizza with garlic and added sausage and red peppers. Yum! Certainly not Pizza Hut priced, but obviously better quality.  Our server was nice and on top of refills, made suggestions, etc. A hoppin place--large space with lots of tables, most of which were full the night we were there. Tends to be kinda loud, but not overly so and you can still conversate."}
{"text":"I called in my order sat and waited for 20 mins. Food was average. Nothing to write home about  Waitress was rude  no tip for her it's like I was a bother because I wasn't sitting there buying drinks"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars but not quite a 4. Woulda given a 4 but it just isn't as good as the Brooklyn location which I've been to. I think it's because maybe the mozzarella isn't as fresh, maybe the sauce - I couldn't figure it out. It's good pizza. Slightly better than the one they sell late night at Cosmopolitan. It is authentic NY style but just not as good as their NY location. In terms of other pizza joints in Vegas, it's probably one of the best if not the best. I had no problems with my service at this location or the Palazzo location. If you're on a budget I suggest the pizza at the Cosmo, otherwise this is probably the best Vegas has to offer."}
{"text":"If you wan to pay top dollar for a mediocre pizza and eat in a noisy restaurant with crappy service so you can tell your friends you 'went to Grimaldis', this is the place for you.  Total  'Snottsdale' hype."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, desserts and ambience here. It is my favorite pizza place if you can't tell by all the check-ins. If you like coal brick oven pizza then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza!!! The sauce is the best in town.  I order just the pepperoni with extra sauce and extra crispy.  I have been there a dozen times and have NEVER been disappointed. The service is attentive and knowledgeable"}
{"text":"The place was packed, which is fine. But when numerous kids from different tables are hovering around your table and screaming for attention, the staff needs to apply some limitations on what is acceptable and what is impolite. Sure, parents should be doing the parenting but who am I kidding?!  As for the food it was okay. Though too much cheese and not enough toppings. Our waiter also messed up one of the orders. They then also completely forgot one of our orders afterward. Sure, things were busy but if the waiter had written everything down with a pen and paper then there wouldn't have been any issues. In fact, why do waiters think that by remembering every detail they're going to get a larger tip?!  The calzones will also constipate you. They're so doughy that all you can do is enjoy now but prepare to be hurting later."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Love their salads! Very friendly staff!  (The only thing I don't like is that the kids are given pizza dough to play with. It just grosses me out. I know it's fun for them, but to watch kids at other tables play with the dough, and waste food... I don't like that part about the restaurant.)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is at a level above the rest. The food is great, but the service is purely awesome. The bartender, Kurt, always goes above and beyond his responsibilities. He welcomes each and every customer as if they are a regular. This mentality has established an ever increasing group of customers that are now regulars due to Kurt.  The decor, music, and overall feel will keep me coming back again and again. Thank you Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has some of the best thin crust pizza you'll ever get the chance to experience. I had the margarita pizza during my first time here, and it probably was the best pizza I've had. Definitely check it out.  The restaurant is very loud, however; so it may not be a good place to go if you're on a date. But if you don't mind just eating delicious pizza and saving the talking for afterwards, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Can you say yum!! We stopped by after a spring training game. Ordered a 16\" pizza which we plenty for my kid and I. Thin crust New York style. So good. I didn't care for the lemonade which had very little taste and the house salad vinaigrette was to tangy for our liking but the pizza and atmosphere was perfect. We were seated fairly quickly and the host was sure to let us know he was clearing a table for us. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This pizza is amazing!!!! The atmosphere is also pretty killer. All of the stuff I have ever eaten from here has been delicious!   The service is always great!   Honestly I think it's the best pizza in the entire metro area"}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but well worth the wait. The calzones were awesome and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and calzones.. They dont have a very large menu though, just pizza, calzones and salads.. It was good but I like thicker crust.. Will probably go back again."}
{"text":"ONE of My absolute FAVE pizza joints! Not cheap but great quality!  One thing I will recommend is to check the bottom of your crust as sometimes the pizzas will get too charred if the person Manning the oven isn't doing their job properly. This happened to us on our visit last week. The bartender handled getting a new one made and the mgr approached us with an apology which was greatly appreciated. My husband was a little Bent because he expected a discount and or a free beer. We had already paid and while waiting hubby ordered another beer. Sadly the tip he left ended up paying for his beer because of his dissatisfaction. I want to apologize to the bartender because he was great!  This will not affect my opinion about the product and staff,  we will be back.  Lastly,  I need to know how to get back on that \"free\" b'day pizza list!  I looked forward to it every year and wish it would continue!!"}
{"text":"Husband and i always visit this place when we are in Vegas! Usually quick, friendly wait staff, good food and decent prices. Conveniently located off Las Vegas Blvd in Venetian right up on second floor this place is definitely an easy go to lunch spot.  We got a 20 inch pizza and we each got 3 slices that were big! Pizza is light and fresh definitely not greasy or heavy. We got the bruschetta trio for an appetizer husband favorite was the olive medley i enjoyed the caprese kind.   They always have a great selection of local craft beer also.   Only negative is this time it took a little over an hour for our meal and we got there around 11:15 and it wasn't too busy at all. Definitely won't stop us visiting next trip though!"}
{"text":"Been to the original Grimaldis under the Brooklyn bridge and that was the best pie I've ever had.  This was second.  Half Don and half kalamata olive pie add basil all over.    Pie was cooked right, thin crust New York style pie.  Crispy bottom crust, good ratios of fresh mozz and just the right amount of sauce.  Came out hot, just the way I like it.   First, the Don.  Basically a meat lovers with pepperoni, sausage and meatballs.  Proteins were generous but didn't have as much flavor as I would've liked.    Now the kalamata olive and basil half.   MOTHER OF GOD.    Perfection on a pie.  I know it doesn't sound that great, but seriously, just try it.  I had huge reservations about a pie with no proteins as well when a Long Islander recommended it to me, but it is soo money and you don't even know it."}
{"text":"Been eating here every couple of months over last 2 years - BUT I'm afraid it will not continue. Quality of food is slowly heading downhill, and remember it is not cheap so value for money is becoming poor. Need to work out better timing for stoking the fire, no pizzas until 5-10pm - lots of customers did not even get out of their cars when they realized this was happening. The TV. In the bar area is terrible, evidently corporate will not fund a HDTV contract as they are not a sports bar. so if the Olympics, Super Bowl, world cups etc are on suggest finding a locale with more suitable facilities"}
{"text":"Had a great experience. Was tired and hungry and had the best service with Selina. Suggested good things and very personable. Let me taste wine first and gave me the history behind it. Food was great and delivered as promised. Selina made the experience worthwhile. Thank you."}
{"text":"My mother and I were walking around the Palazzo looking for dinner, and finally decided on Grimaldi's. The wine and the pizza were great, and Karen delivered excellent service! (Also, the spinach salad was one of the best I've had in forever)   I highly recommend this place if you're tired out from Vegas, and just want to relax and eat some 'za"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's White Pizza with onions is the best pizza you will ever have.  It is awesome!  Check it out for yourself... you wont regret it!  BTW - they also have the best cheesecake in world!  I have had lots of cheesecake and this by far is the best!"}
{"text":"Love this place, been to all of the ones in AZ, CO. and the one in El Segundo. I would recommend it to anyone who can't make it to New York, this is pretty close to the New York style pizza."}
{"text":"Visiting from California.  Best pizza I've ever had.  Service was great too.  Good prices!!"}
{"text":"Always good!  Consistent, I have never had a bad meal here.  They even give our kids dough to play with while we wait for our pizza, the kids LOVE this!  Great food and fantastic service.  Best pizza in AZ!"}
{"text":"We were starving and roaming around late at night hoping to find some food. Alas, Grimaldi's Pizzeria was still open for another hour. I think it was 1 am maybe? Anyway, we ordered the margherita with kalamata olives, just expecting a regular pizza. It was around $18.   Wooo weee those kalamata olives MADE that pizza. It was fantastic! The crust was super thin and the sauce had a great taste . We took it up to our room and devoured that thing. Actually we left 2 pieces but I ate them for breakfast the next morning because it was still that good."}
{"text":"The hubby & I ordered the small pizza with black olives. We were there around 10pm on a Sunday evening.   1. Quality of food - The pizza was good. I would say it is 3.5 stars. The edge was quite burn, but that happens sometimes. The crust was really good. The cheese was a little strange how it cooked, maybe it was the type of cheese that was on it...not sure.   2. Service - We were seated in the patio area. The bartender was the server for the entire patio area. He seemed stretched a little thin managing both and he seemed to be outside his comfort zone waiting tables.   3. Alcohol/Bar - We did not order alcohol, but the two tables next to us did & this is based on overhearing them. Both tables ordered cocktails & both were unhappy with the quality. They both mentioned it to the server (not aware he was the one who made them) & he awkwardly apologized, but didn't offer to mend the problem in any way. One of the tables ordered a beer that was on tap to supplement the poor tasting cocktail & when the drink arrived, the glass was a little over half full. Based on my ease dropping ;) I would not come here for the alcohol.   4. Cleanliness - The bathroom wreaked of urine. I am pretty sure it is what was all over the floor...yuck.   This place looks nice, but they just didn't have it together."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a large Margherita pizza with my family for lunch today. Crust and toppings were perfect. It was plenty of food for the 3 of us. Wish I was hungrier. Would have tried the Caprese salad.  Half a carafe of Ferrani-Carano Sienna red blend was pricey but yummy.   Service was good.  This is the second time we have eaten at Grimaldi's. We will return.  F"}
{"text":"Skip the lines in Brooklyn and just come to the one in Vegas! Crispy crust perfectly complemented toppings, affordable but quality Italian wines, fab cocktails, good service, really can't recommend this place highly enough. Want New York quality pizza just off the strip?...come here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great. The service is okay, at times annoying. They ignored us while carrying on a personal conversation right next to our table on 3 separate occasions. I happen to really enjoy the pizza so I put up with it. I wish they would get on board with the ability to charge your meal to your room."}
{"text":"We ate at the one in Fashion Mall (or whatever it's called). The pizza was amazing - just as I'd remembered from New York. We got a large with meatballs and jalapenos. It was soooo good. Our service was great, and we enjoyed our meal. I'd definitely go back in a second. Not too heavy at all with it being thin crust and lighter on the cheese. Seriously so good. Go!"}
{"text":"This is best pizza is the west side we had a very good customer service , that salad was awesome and very affordable prices"}
{"text":"Can't believe this place hasn't gotten more reviews, but I'm here to support. This also gets posted on Facebook so that I can promote it. I would give this place 5-stars just for food. I'll be honest about that. The 1 star deduction is just for price. It is quite pricey to get the perfect pizza. Which is probably what I got. We got a tip from the local to get extra sauce, extra cheese, and fresh garlic. I'll tell you right now each of those items are 2$ a piece. Me and 3 other friends got a large which I think is an 18\" pizza, we all picked a topping and added the 3 mentioned above, one already being my friend's aloof choice, one added mushroom, another added pepporoni, and I added ricotta cheese (which I think helped make the pizza that good hehe). The pizza itself was 16$ I think, but add 12$ in added-ons, and there ya go 28$ but it was pretty damn good. I have to honestly say it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I've had my share of the mom and pop joints, hell I love em' but this place is just great. The crust perfectly wood oven baked, the amount of each ingredient was perfect, but still curious if we ordered extra cheese and extra sauce, I didn't feel like there was extra anything hehe, but otherwise a great pizza, and wouldn't mind coming back here again."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza, EVER. It's amazing and completely perfect. Me and my boyfriend alone can kill a whole pie, easily. I have eaten at the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn New York and that was amazing as well, and there is no noticeable difference between that location and ours! Anyone giving this place negative reviews on the food knows nothing about real pizza... or should get their head examined ;-)  It is a little pricey I admit, and the toppings really rack up the bill if you add a lot on. But its so good it really is worth every penny. If you want to be cheap and save some money, you will probably find yourself eating that garbage Pizza hut or dominoes serves. Grimaldi's is the real deal.  P.S. No time to dine in? Call ahead and pick up."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the original location on Front Street a couple of times, and this is just as good. I went to the one at the Fashion Show shopping center. Nice spot with big airy dining area and open kitchen. Great staff and still one of the best pizza's I have anywhere in the country. Found out from the server, they treat the water to add minerals to mimic the water used for the dough in NYC. If you have never had coal fire pizza, you really need too. The ovens are even hotter than wood fire and that results in an even better dough. They make pizza the correct way, without too much cheese and a balanced sauce (not too sweet). If you need your real NYC pizza fix, you can't do better in Las Vegas. Definitely worth going out of the way for if you are craving great pizza."}
{"text":"Long wait on sat night.  Nice waitress. Delicious pizza. Tomato sauce was very light and fresh. Sausage and pepperoni were very good. Nice amount of cheese. Great place to take kids."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing service. Will be back for sure on my next Arizona trip. Great employees and management"}
{"text":"8/6/17 Always a great experience coming here. Food was cooked perfectly and delicious ~ ordered the Bruschetta Trio (Classic, Olive Medley & Marinated Mushrooms and Roasted Red Bellpeppers), and The Don Pizza! Excellent service from Brandy! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I just tried Grimaldi's for the first time and enjoyed the experience on the whole. Their pizza is quite unique and while I wouldn't say it is a favorite of mine it is still very good. We also ordered two small salads and were surprised by how big they were. We wondered what the large salads must look like. Also, the cheesecake was some of the best I have had in awhile. That was probably even better than the pizza to tell you the truth.  The restaurant did feel a little crowded and there were certainly a lot of people there, but it seemed like a great place to eat nonetheless. The prices are slightly higher than what I expected, but I still had a nice experience at this pizzeria."}
{"text":"The pizza sauce is a bit bland for my taste.  The bar area could use a good wipe down.  Sorry, I expect a little better for the price."}
{"text":"Went here on Friday night and there were empty tables and 20 people waiting. People who came after us were sat first and we still waited. Super unprofessional of a restaurant on a busy night. Lost a customer right here."}
{"text":"One of our favorite lunch spots. Nice atmosphere for business lunches. Always fresh ingredients and high quality food.  I'm a Chicagoan transplant, so I'll make no claims to know anything about what good \"New York style pizza\" is, but my full blooded Italian and Sicilian colleagues like it there.   Must be good enough."}
{"text":"Stopped into this wonderful location for dinner the other night and I must say the pizza and salad are to die for! First time eating here and I will definitely be dining here more often! Also will be requesting Trisha as my server considering how sweet and helpful she was with everything! So nice to be served by someone who takes their job so seriously"}
{"text":"My favorite place to get pizza. Fresh out of the oven, their pizzas taste like New York's finest! Not to mention their incredible cheesecake and appetizers. Great place for a night out or to take the kids. Perfect pizza every time!"}
{"text":"First time I've had a calzone outside of NY that was actually worth eating! Super friendly staff, tasty Italian wine. Affordable too!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. thin crust. The cheeses is very fresh and salads are huge."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was great! My wife and I loved the pizza and they have some great beers on tap! It's a must try if you enjoy pizza!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. The service was terrible, it took 45 mins to get our pizza. It arrived with Tyson frozen chicken on it and the pizza sauce tastes like acidic tomatoes. I will NEVER go there again. And there was no soap on the bathroom"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here!  Thin, crispy and never soggy! The sausage with Roma tomatoes is our favorite!  The pizza is simply delicious!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but every time I come here it's something! They tell us this time it would be about 15 to 20 min and had to wait 45 min! Sucks because the food is so good but don't think I'll be back! Waitress CJ is good though!"}
{"text":"It was delicious! I loved the thin crust, peppery tomato sauce, and the mouth watering mozzarella. It hit the spot.  Got sausage and mushroom for toppings.  The one bad thing is all the toppings are a la carte $2 bucks each...unless you get the special of the day."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizzeria is hands down the best pizza I have ever had! We have never received bad service, and we def. have never had an issue with the food. We usually order a White garlic pizza with tomato, caprese salad to split and their irresitable tiramasu. Great atmosphere, great staff, amazing food!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, great atmosphere, good wine.   Sign up (on their website) for \"emails\" and they send you a free large pizza on your birthday -- an $18 value. Totally worth it.   Bread (for appetizers) is free here, you just have to know to ask.   Step out of your comfort zone and try the white sauce or the pesto...its amazing."}
{"text":"Great pizza. My 14 year old son says, \"best pizza I've ever had!\" That's quite a compliment from him."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night during spring training. Thought it would be busy and it was. Put our name in for a table and it was an hour wait. Looked at the menu and opted to get s pizza to go. I wanted a salami and mushroom but salami wasn't listed as a pizza topping. I did see it was an option for a salad tipping which I thought was odd. I asked the hostess if we could order to go. She said sure but when I asked for a salami and mushroom she balked when I told her it was listed as a salad topping not a pizza topping. She said she needed managers approval for that. I shrugged and said fine if that's what's needed. She then went back to her other hostess duties and I stepped over to the bar.   Anyway I watched the game and had a beer. 45 minutes later I walk back to the hostess to check on how much longer the pizza would be. She gives me a lost look and told me she forgot to get manager permission and place the order. Are you kidding me!?!?  I ask her if she can get the order in. She noted she would get right on it. This time I waited at the hostess stand. It took another good ten minutes for the manger to make it to the front. At that point he was surprised and as he said a little embarrassed that salami wasn't listed. He said of course I could have salami. So the order gets in about 60 minutes after my first attempt. I ask to pay for it and was told I could pay when It came up front.   Back to the bar I go. At the bar I noticed folks eating pizza and saw many with sauces on the side for the pizza, others hitting it hard with garlic salt, oregano, parmesan cheese, black pepper and red pepper. I always found it odd that people assault a pizza like that. Later I realized this was largely due to the pizza lacking any flavor, just a light smear of sauce and very little cheese. Nearly an hour passes and I go back to the hostess to ask about my pizza. The manager happened to be there as well and said it's sure taking forever for that pizza. He goes back and of course it was ready. No apology for the delays and was more like lucky you, here's the pizza. Likely spent time parked on the top of the oven. I settle up payment and headed back to the hotel.   OVER TWO HOURS to get a pizza to go!!  Hungry as hell we dive in only to find the pie crust was rubber, likely from being parked in a warmer box, sauce was nearly absent as was the cheese. The salami was so skimpy and the mushrooms we almost nonexistent.   Not sure why folks love this place so much. It's a one and done for me. Never again."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night.  The entire meal was great.  We started with a caesar salad and a caprese salad.  Both were good.  The croutons on the caesar were very flavorful, and there were huge basil leaves with the caprese.  For pizza, we had a white pizza, and a traditional.  Both were excellent.  If I had a suggestion (not a complaint,) it would be to go with a different pepperoni.  Theirs is kinda cheap tasting, like the kind you get on a frozen pizza.  The sausage was good though.  Dessert, I had Tiramisu, my favorite.  I have yet to ever had a bad Tiramisu, just \"less than great\" Tiramisu.  This falls under \"less than great.\"  It is the same frozen/thawed Tiramisu that most places have.  It was good, I was just hoping for better.  Regardless of the dessert, or the pepperoni, we had great service and will difinitely go back."}
{"text":"First time here and we were absolutely pleased!  The service was impeccable...and we even got to taste several of the wines before ordering a glass.  We had no wait time getting seated (we went around 4pm) and our food was served very quickly.  I loved the atmosphere and the pizza was delicious!!  Will certainly return."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this pizza place. My wife hasn't stopped talking about it since we tried it. It's a little expensive for pizza, but well worth the price. I'm not exactly sure how we got a $50 tab for 2 pizzas and drinks, but we did. I think we had an appetizer as well.  So far this Grimaldi's has had the best pizza that I've tried here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Decided to have lunch with my child and went to Grimaldi.  Hostess super nice and personable. Alex (foodserver) very nice but should have explained to my 9 year old son that \"cheese pizza\" was not going to be what he expected. My son pizza arrived and looked like it had slices of cheese and not cheese all over it. Had to send it back. My pizza arrived and was a personal size pizza, no cheese add artichokes, garlic, and peppers. By the time I am done eating my son's pizza finally arrived. My pizza was $19.00!! That is crazy!! NEVER AGAIN! I wish there was a way to add copy of my receipt to show you that I am not making this up!"}
{"text":". This is still one of my favorite places to come for pizza when I'm in the mood for wood-fired pizzas always great most of their other items are good the salads are a little Bland but it's all about pizza here my favorite is mushroom and onion cooked well done I like the fact that it's crispy a little thin not too much sauce cook perfect the service on the other hand normally sucks never can get refills usually the server only comes by to take the order and to bring the food nothing else and all the times I've been there no manager has ever came in talk to us even though the place is slow when we go even though the place is slow when we go will probably always go there just because you like the pizza one day this service will get together so the pizza is a must try other things are average or below just expect to have crappy service"}
{"text":"Still love this place. I try and make it here every time in Vegas. Well worth the drive for some of the best NY style pizza in the West.  Service is still great and friendly.  I ate at the bar this time, and Anthony was super cool and funny."}
{"text":"I love pizza. When in Vegas, you must eat here. Plus, it's at the fashion show mall so you can get some shopping done too. The crust is thin and crispy, the toppings are fresh, and the sauce is not too overwhelming. I don't eat too much at once so I skip the appetizers and go straight to the pizza. Whether you get a red or a white, they're both equally delicious, which is why we always get both. The servers are nice, and there are TV's just in case you need to watch a sporting event at the same time. This is another place we go to every time we're in Vegas. We used to go to that place in New York New York, but after trying the pizza at Grimaldi's, we haven't been there since. The balance of crust to toppings in perfect, and the crust doesn't get soggy. What a great place to eat at the mall!"}
{"text":"Trying this place again for the 2nd time and pizza is very good. I like the thin crust so makes you feel like not having all those carbs. The pizza can get expensive when you add all the toppings since cost for each other then that it was good. Now make sure you have sunglasses since when the AZ hear beats down on the front window and sun shines in your face that would be the only draw back"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after wandering around the Venetian. Ordered 2 pizzas and 2 salads. Pizza was nice. Thin crust NY style and fresh mozzarella. Gobbled it all up nicely."}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Wood fired crust makes a  Margarita selection superb!  Outdoor seating when weather permits is a bonus."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. Pizza was okay but that was it. Service was okay. It was strange to cram our party of 6 at a table for 4 but...."}
{"text":"Slow to order and bring drinks. Brought appetisers still no water or drinks!!! Messed up  pizza order ! Poor service, slow service, pricey mediocre pizza!! Go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. What can I say?!?!??  We love the white pizza with garlic then fresh basil at the last minute. The house Merlot is always on our table :)  We always start with the Med salad with no onion and dressing on the side :) This location has EXCELLENT fast customer service and from the minute you walk in the door the host is always smiling and the servers are always awesome. I have a fav but don't know her name :( thin, pretty and very dark hair."}
{"text":"My oh my oh my! I am a newbie to the brick oven pizza. I fell in love with an oven from another mother (on vacation) and my husband took me here. I didn't think it would be the same so I was a bit reluctant to try. They gave our daughter dough to play with which gained my attention instantly. The servers were super nice and helpful as I am not easy to please and come with a crapload of personality (& questions). The pizza was so good! And even when I started to feel full I couldn't stop eating. They warned us not to get to full because of dessert and we totally did! So we waited a while and ordered the seasonal reesees cheesecake and like I said... My oh my!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the customer service has been some of the best I've ever had. The staff were very helpful with food choices."}
{"text":"I ordered $50 worth of food for my myself and co-workers through UberEats. Unfortunately, we were very unhappy with the quality of our food. We contacted Grimaldi's and spoke to the Adam who promised make things right if we agree to pick up the food instead of having it delivered by UberEats. What a difference it made! We were so happy with the food the second time around. The quality of the cheese and pizza sauce, combined with perfectly soft and crunchy brick-fired bread was delicious. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, Grimaldi's!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, if not the best, pizza in Las Vegas. It certainly is one of the top spots in NYC and it's now been brought to the strip. They don't have any preset options so you better know what you want. I found the pricing a little weird cause it's the same price per topping no matter what size pizza (and if you do half or whole pizza for the topping).   We tried a large sausage, bell pepper, and mushroom which was excellent. We also tried a small chicken and roma tomatoes. The two pizzas fed 4 people to be completely full.  Service was friendly and attentive -- pizza took a little while but it was worth it and they made it completely from scratch. The place feels like a slightly upscale family pizzeria.  It's too bad it's not for late night eating."}
{"text":"Good pizza, especially late night and for groups. It's more of a sitdown pizza experience though not super upscale.   If you want a quality pie though (not by the slice), then I'd come here. It's almost as good as the NYC location."}
{"text":"Good pizza is hard to find and this joint delivers. Has a really good pizza and a few beverages. I would recommend to anyone who likes new York style pizza and stiff drinks. Very good find here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Crisp and thin Brooklyn style pizza. It was very good. Note that the menu has little else except salads. We tried the dessert sampler and really enjoyed the cheesecake, cannoli and tiramisu. The restaurant has a long wait on weekends so we chose to sit on the patio. It was a bit warm but the service was still very good."}
{"text":"Very good service!  Great pizza! Taking whole family next time! Reminds me of new york!"}
{"text":"We used my birthday pizza coupon tonight.  The pizza was sooooo good.  We also ordered a calzone.  I really do love this place.  It is fast becoming one of my favorite pizza places."}
{"text":"Gosh, I grew up not far from the original delicious Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge.. Since, I've lived in Tennessee and Missouri and was thinking my move to Arizona would be another area I was moving to with a subpar version of \"pizza\". This is darn spot on to my original fave under the Brooklyn Bridge!!! I can't tell you the joy this brings me to have Grimaldi's within 15 minutes of me even though I'm thousands of miles from New York..   Please get the spicy chicken sausage, but you can't go wrong just an original, I always get both and have breakfast the next day..   Staff here is fantastic, At times when I'm not feeling selfish I will purchase some for work and they gladly increase the cuts in a pie.. And I've also created some addicts from work as well who never knew how good pizza could truly be.. Oh and Yes I called it a \"pie\" ;)"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm..... Yummy!!!!! Went on a whim with my husband for an early dinner in a Saturday night. We got seated right away.  We now get pizza to go every couple of weeks. I love the crispy crust and cheese that they use.  I am a happy girl with just a simple cheese pizza if it is quality and this is very quality. Favorite pizza in the valley."}
{"text":"Get the original sauce. Load it up with Italian sausage, mushrooms, oven roasted sweet red peppers and extra mozzarella.  The New York style pizza is thin. The sauce soaks into the dough. This is definitely a fold it up type of pizza! The sweetness from the red peppers & sauce complimented so well with the savory of the sausage and mushrooms.  Grimaldi's is definitely one of a kind with its New York water that is used to create its special dough. I wish I could get a slice right now."}
{"text":"As good as any pizza in NY love it and the kale salad is great also. Love all the locations except the one in Kierland for some reason isn't as good or maybe it was an off night haven't tried it again. Don't want to risk it ever"}
{"text":"Very thin and crunchy crust.  Descent toppings. Not NY but good.  There is not anything else other than Cal zones on the menu.  The salads were excellent but with subpar dressings."}
{"text":"Food is on point! Had the Pesto pizza and the house salad as well as paired it all with the House Red to wash it down. So good! Service was friendly enough. A bit rushed at the end for some reason but it could have been a shift change situation. I would recommend this location. We went for an early dinner about 5:30. The shoppers weren't crowded at all and there weren't many people at the restaurant either. It was perfect for our needs of a quiet tasty meal."}
{"text":"Still enjoyed my pizza.. went with the white paired it with the house red and tried the Mediterranean salad this time. Wasn't a huge fan of the salad. Ingredients were crisp and fresh, I just didn't find it as satisfying as the house salad. Service was perfect and always appreciated. I would go to this location again. We went during lunchtime and thought the place would be packed. To our surprise it was totally chill."}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's for lunch. Hostess sat us at three different tables that were all filthy.  Walked out."}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best pizzeria in town! The first thing that caught my eye is their beautiful decor. I love how they creatively use wine bottles as an ornamental lighting, it's sophisticated and just brilliant. The attention-to-detail of art, people and culture makes me feel warm and welcome. When I am craving for Italian cuisine, this is my go-to place for coal brick-oven, crispy thin crust pizza. I ordered the 12-inch pizza with three toppings: spicy chicken sausage, mushrooms, and oven roasted sweet red peppers. The flavor and texture are simply amazing, and the portions are so worth the price. Their quality of service is superb. I always leave with a big smile on my face and a happy tummy."}
{"text":"Grimaldis is my favorite Pizzeria.  I love Grimaldis in NY, in LA, and now in Vegas.   The pizza is always consistent!  The crust is perfect (currently slightly drooling thinking about such amazing carbs), not to mention the melted mozzarella, and the ever so slightly tangy, yet somehow spicy but well-seasoned marinara.   Hungry yet?   I know I am.   I prefer the large pizza because its your best bang for the buck.  This pizza is killer the next day!  My personal favorites are the chicken sausage, jalapenos (ask them to go easy because they're HOT), and mushrooms.   Done, and done.   I could go on forever and paint the perfect picture of this pizza but seriously you'd waste too much time reading my review when you should just be eating there already!  Also, the spinach salad is a must as well, just make sure to tell them no bacon. It'll mess with your palate otherwise.   Either way I think I'll have pizza now!  Grimalids in El Segundo, CA here I come!  Here's to 5 star ratings that are truly worthy of much applause!  Happy Eats Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza place! The staff is always super friendly and attentive.  As a single mom it can be hard taking two young children out, but my boys LOVE this place and we are always treated very well.  Highly recommend, whether for a family, date night, ladies' night out - you won't be disappointed in the food or the service."}
{"text":"Good pizza and good service. I like the flavor of the red sauce and the thin but not too thin crust. Price was a little high for the Quality of ingredients but still reasonable."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while we were in from out of town and didn't know any better. Man, did we luck out.  Grimaldi's reminds us that all chains are not inherently evil.  Hostess and bartender were both super nice, professional, and attentive.  We sat at the bar while we waited for our order, which we took to go.  Wine list was respectable, and they have a decent draft beer selection (a couple of standards, a couple of seasonals, a couple of locals...).  Pizza was outstanding - they have not forgotten their NY roots.  Delicious crust generously topped with pepperoni, onions, and shrooms.  In a word, fuhgedaboutit!  \"Small\" Mediterranean salad was really ample, though they could have been a tad more generous with the ingredients that make it Mediterranean.  Tasty dressing, obviously homemade.    All for a fair price.  We were pleasantly impressed and would go back if we ever find ourselves in Scottsdale again (which we kind of hope we do not)."}
{"text":"Love the Sundried Tomato, Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza! Went here a few times already and my order has never changed. Love love love the size of the pizza and the yummy thin & crispy crust. Interior design was reminiscent of classic Italian places and people. Servers were friendly & ambiance was welcoming. Not a fan of the price but when I really do crave Grimaldi's, I have to have it."}
{"text":"Second time I've eaten here and it's still one of the top pizza places in my book. I could eat the large house salad all by myself! It's the perfect blend of salad, house dressing, and mushrooms/onions/etc. Any pizza with the white cheese (the name escapes me) is amazing. The most recent one I had was the pepperoni and sausage pizza. The large can easily feed 4 people with 2 huge slices. Super friendly staff and I can't wait to keep trying more types of pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. They where short a server, but the manager was out in the dinning room helping out. It was my boyfriend's and I first time there and they made sure to make us feel super welcomed. The food was fantastic, the service was just as good, and the dinning room was very comfortable. I am defiantly going back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a strong recommendation from a friend. After reading the reviews, I was anxious to try it out. I went on a Saturday night, half expecting it to be really busy. We were seated in about five minutes or less. Not busy on a Saturday night...made me kind of worried.   The menu is sparse, it made ordering really easy.  Service was fairly slow considering the small amount of people in the restaurant. Refills were slow, service was kind of inattentive but not rude. Our pizza came out in about 15-20 mins. We ordered a white with garlic with pepperoni and sausage. The pizza looked and smelled delicious, but that's where it all went bad.  First off, the pizza crust was really soggy because of all the grease under the pizza. I have never ate such a greasy pizza in my life. i had to drain every single slice, it literally created a puddle on my plate. There was a significant lack of sauce on my pizza, some parts of my crust were bare, not even a hint of red on them. The pepperoni and the sausage tasted great and there was enough toppings on the pizza to justify the $2 price tag.   The non soggy areas of crust were great, and the cheese was amazing. We ended up taking half the pizza home, the slices were filling. The pizza was better the next day, after the box absorbed most of the grease, after throwing away the pizza box, the bottom of the box was saturated in grease. I'm not sure if grease makes a quality pizza, but in this case it just made a soggy crust.  **Update** Under intense pressure I came back here and tried a white with chicken, they seriously redeemed themselves. I spoke to the manager and he insisted my last time was a fluke and should have been corrected. I would come back on occasion."}
{"text":"The absolute best pizza I have ever had in Las Vegas.  Actually I would go further to say the best pizza I have had in all of Nevada or Arizona or California.  Maybe we hit them on a good day, but WOW fabulous thin crust.  I felt like I was in New York.  Located in the Palazzo, through the casino up the escalators and to the left.  You must try it, you will love the pizza and the price is great.  We walked out with a large pizza to go with Linguica (italian pepperoni) and two drinks....$20.00 can't beat that!!"}
{"text":"We dropped in late one night after drinking.  Not many people were in the restaurant so we got seated immediately.  Service was good.  The pizza was just OK to me.  Definitely a place to check out though."}
{"text":"I went to Grimaldi's yesterday and had a pleasant experience. I tried the a pepperoni pizza with spicy chicken sausage and a Cesar Salad. First off the portions were huge. I usually have about two slices of pizza but one sufficed. The chicken Cesar salad was also a hefty size. Overall the food was pretty delicious. The employees were really friendly and welcoming. I would return when given the opportunity."}
{"text":"My roommates recommended I try this place. Couldn't have been more impressed. The 4 cheese pizza with any topping is PHENOMENAL. Such sauce. Very pasta."}
{"text":"Incredibly bland pizza. The sauce has a slight tomato taste. What disappointment. Not recommend if you like a traditional pizza."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the Valley - and that is coming from someone from Chicago, who usually prefers that city's pies over all others. They keep the menu simple, with pizza and salad. And that is all you need. The salads are spot-on and the pizza is magisterial. The service can be hit or miss, and there is nothing special about the decor, but the pizza alone is enough for the five-star rating. As an added bonus, they have a solid wine list that is very reasonable! (The Coppola Rosso is one of the best wine deals in any restaurant.)"}
{"text":"We had a cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza for take out.  We live 5 minutes away. Got home and sat down right away...both were cold.  Both had very little ingrediants, very flat, but not a flat bread pizza.  The pepperoni was tolerable, but barely.  The cheese was just tasteless.  Maybe we are just spoiled, being from the East Coast, but this was not what we were hoping for."}
{"text":"I went to Grimaldi's for an early dinner a few weeks ago and I used a coupon that I received after signing up for their mailing list. The pizza was decent, not the best but decent. The service left much to be desired as I noticed the tables in front of me and behind me received more attention. I dined alone that day which made it noticeable. The pizza was good enough that I would return to Grimaldi's the next time I receive coupon."}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype.  I have had better pizza elsewhere. Bottom line, I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"Love it.   Great Place, nice Location.    Maybe a happy Hour Would be Great. ;-)   Manager i forgot his Name greated & seated us immediatly & was so nice. Explained everything.    Out waiter Ron or Ross??? I think Ross was nice & attentive  Food : we ordered Pizza & mushrooms. It was excellent  Salat was Great Too  Sizes are huge & Perfect to Share.  Will  be back soon."}
{"text":"First time here, and overall I liked it. Pizzas are a la carte. It was Valentines Day so it was pretty busy but our waiter was still very attentive, something I appreciate considering how busy they were."}
{"text":"You know I really like this Pizza.. I just cant believe when I go here.. I drop $100 on Pizza for 5 people.. Seems extreme.. I mean its good Pizza.. but just flat out too much money.. Seriously.. food is good.. but Golden Steer.. Lawry's.. same price point.. too much for Pizza.. Man.. now I want Steak.."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the one in Brooklyn due to all its hype. I swear the line out the door in Brooklyn was at least 50 people long. I've done extensive research on neopolitan pizza and have spent tons of money across the country at some the most infamous places. I don't get it. It's ok. A solid 3 stars, but there is so much better, tastier, and cheaper out there."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this place last night for dinner and I have to say I wasn't all that impressed. Our pizza was a decent pie but the middle of it was all gooey and uncooked. Now I don't know if this a common problem with natural coal stoves or what, so I'm not going to slam them too hard because of that.  I will however slam them for the caprese salad we ordered. Mozzarella was mediocre at best but the real kicker was the three day old thinly cut pieces of tomato. I mean come on, show some pride in your product and cut me a fresh tomato. Don't give me slices of tomato that have been sitting in a sixth pan for three days."}
{"text":"Grimaldis is great! I went after we found they have scientists that have replicated the NY water to make true NY pizza. It is just that - true New York pizza that you will never get any other place than New York.   The pizza is excellent and the menu is extremely basic - I like that.   I have two kids and they bring the dough for them to play with while we wait for the order. The wait has never been more than 20 minutes from the time we order to the time we get our fabulous food. Our waiters have always been good about refills.  They also have a half off Tuesday for their wines!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza. The space is a bit cramped. The pizza is doable. I enjoy thin crust. Service is always good. The flavor just didn't stand out like i hoped."}
{"text":"We just moved from AK two months ago and this is the only pizza place we eat! The salads are freshly made, the pizza is nothing but fantastic and the staff are exceptional! We are so happy to have found a place that not only serves delicious food but does so with a smile.  We especially appreciate Jamison, who we adore and ask for every time we go there to eat;)  We are so happy we found this place and always bring our guests from AK when they visit;)"}
{"text":"Don't need to say much more about Grimaldis other than yum. The crust is very tasty on its own (crispy yet soft), delicious sauce, as well! Haven't had a pizza I didn't like! Only thing is I find this location a bit dark so the one at the Scottsdale Quarter is my preference!"}
{"text":"The food is great and all. They have a great selection of salads and pizza. They only lack delivery. I wish they provide delivery. When I can't make the drive to pick up pizza, I always have to order from their competitor down the street the reason only because they have delivery. I has Grimaldi's pizza yesterday for dinner was so good."}
{"text":"Every time my husband and I come here the food is delicious and today did not disappoint.  Our waiter was Javier and he was very friendly and attentive. We requested a change on our order and he immediately said \"no problem\". We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it's now our favorite!"}
{"text":"The first thing worth mentioning is the adorably cute pizza slice shaped buzzers! I secretly added bonus points to Grimaldi's just for that. It made the short wait for our table kind of exciting as I waited to see how cute the darn thing is with the pepperoni and green peppers lighting up. I can't help it. I dig clever little things like that.  But on to the food....we ordered a pizza and a small bowl of caesar salad. The fiance was super hungry so he ordered us the antipasto appetizer as well. The appy and salad were really good  with a fresh taste and light feel. I think it actually paired really with our pizza so it was nice to have both. The pizza itself is thin crust and baked in a coal oven so it's crispy and a little smoky. All good stuff in my book. The pizza was crispy yet moist and the toppings tasted great. The fiance really liked the pepperoni here and I had to agree. We were excited that we were going to have pizza leftover to enjoy again later at home!  We waited about 15 minutes for a table but it was Friday night dinner so I consider that a victory. Service was great and pleasant with someone checking in frequently to see if we were doing all right and enjoying our meal. I love the ambiance and feel of the place - I wanted to take home one of their wine bottle chandeliers!  PS: Don't forget to sign up for emails from Grimaldi's! They send you a pretty awesome coupon for your birthday!"}
{"text":"I actually felt like I was in New York.  The servers where very helpful with the menu.  Very friendly and happy.  Also clean positive environment.  Will return.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Surprisingly, my favorite thing about Vegas isn't the debauchery or gambling.  It is the fact that it's become a melting pot to some of the nation's best food.  Next door you'll find a frozen custard place imported from Utah.  You could also find some of the most popular burger places from NYC and Cali.  But what got me excited was the fact that at Grimaldi's, I could have New York's best pizza on the west coast!  In Vegas they actually have three locations.  I chose this location because of its proximity to my hotel and because of it's late hours (it closed at midnight on Saturday night).  What I loved about Grimaldi's in New York was its amazing crust, is fresh tomato sauce, and its fresh ingredients.  It was just perfect.  For my visit to this Vegas location, I ordered a Margherita pizza with garlic and  a pesto pizza with chicken and tomato.  Both pizzas were winners.  I love the pizza dough - it's chewy and it has a nice sweet flavor.  The margherita is a personal favorite of mine - I just love the simple flavor and the perfect balance of the tomato sauce, cheese, and basil.  My only gripe is that the pizza was that I felt that the crust could have been cooked a little more.   I can't really tell you with certainty how this compares to NYC, but I can tell you with certainty that I was so glad to have some legit NY pizza on the west coast.  Definitely give Grimaldi's a shot if you're not able to go to Brooklyn.  There are two locations west of the strip and there's a 3rd location at the mall that's across the strip from the Wynn Hotel."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the damn Secret Pizza place in Cosmopolitan, but this is Las Vegas' real secret pizza.   The original Grimaldi's is found right by the Brooklyn Bridge in New York.  In America's pizza capital, it was my favorite slice of pizza.    Grimaldi's is known for their spongy sweet crust from their coal ovens.  They also have some great tomato sauce.  They have 5 locations in Las Vegas.  Of the 3 locations I've been to, this yielded the best pizza.  The other reason to come here is that it's high quality food for a cheap price.  I got a nice glass of Peroni beer for $5 and my personal Pizza for $10.  I love to get my pizza with basil, garlic, and tomato.  You don't need anything else.  It's so good."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago. Alright, from that you already know I love me some deep dish pizza. but I DO occasionally enjoy your New York style crust.  After getting recommendations from friends that visited the original \"under the Brooklyn bridge\" location we had to try it.    Starters: Salads are good. Nothing to rave about but a nice starter. Both the house and Caesar are well tossed with crisp lettuce and not drowned in dressing. If your a  Caprese salad fan, this is a good choice as well, with healthy slices of buffalo moz  and fresh tomatoes drizzled with the right amount of oil and vinegar. PIZZA: I LOVE PIZZA! and I LOVE GRIMALDI's.  bold words coming from a Chicago native... We have tried all of the sauces (red, white with garlic, and pesto) and although they are all delicious, I just love the standard red sauce.  Top it with Pepperoni (old world style full of flavor), mushrooms, and roasted sweet red peppers (peppers are roasted in house! and has a perfect blend of sweet to compliment the saltiness of the pepperoni). Instead of  large try ordering two personal pizza (one red and one white or pesto) to get a good variety! it's still a lot of pizza for 2 despite it's name of \"personal\", this isn't your airport pizza hut to-go personal portion!  We always do red with the above mentioned ingredients and a white pizza with sausage!  I love that they put fresh basil in the middle for that added little smack of flavor in your first bite!  Desert: In house made Cheesecake? YES PLEASE! I love the classic new york style with raspberry drizzle! (i've heard the turtle cheesecake is FTW also). Delicious and creamy, i think i heard angels sing as i took my first bite (maybe sounded like a combination of fergie and Jesus! Step bros anyone?) We asked why it was so good, they said they use sour cream in it. Really? that's it? no tears from a unicorn? no bottled baby's laughter? ok...  Price is a little high for a casual pizza but you get what you pay for. $10 for a cardboard ketchup pizza from your local chain? or spend $23 on a pizza that you won't forget.  Service is usually good, no complaints.    One thing is, i recommend to eat in! Since the pizza is thin, you lose the crispness of the crust and it tends to get cold quick! so you better live less than 5 minutes away if your carrying out..  OVERALL RECOMMEND! EAT GOOD FOOD!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to Grimaldi's all the time. We always have a good server along with good customer service. The pizza is always so delicious. However, this last visit was great! Tommy from the Bronx was our server and we recommend him if you'd like a great server. It was nice to see him mentioned in another review. He definitely deserves the recognition. We left him a $20 tip and he was very appreciative. We'll be asking for him from now on."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Grimaldi's today. Finally, a great pizza! We have been missing Mary's Pizza in the San Francisco Bay Area ever since we moved to Utah in 2003. Never did find a pizza that would get your mouth watering prior to actually eating it in Utah. Three month's ago we moved to Las Vegas and I am so happy that we finally found a pizzeria that we can look forward to. Our pizza was fabulous and the service was amazing. Only negative was that there wasn't enough leftover pizza tonight. I only had two slices and was bummed out because I wanted more! Never have liked warmed up pizza so much. Will definitely be going back to Grimaldi's every chance I get."}
{"text":"This place rocks,   Awesome thin crust pizza made in a brick oven, the place does one thing make salad for starter and pizza then they have amazing desserts.  It's also a bar.  Pizza awesome  Staff awesome especially Kacey Desserts were also awesome Prices were cheap!! $9 for 12 inch personal pizza!!"}
{"text":"This is my 14 year old daughter's favorite pizza place and has very good pizza the salads are fresh all the ingredients are fresh and it's really nice very busy on the weekends but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Our family ate there over Spring Break, 2013.  Great location in an upscale shopping area.  The best pesto pizza ever.  Everything wonderful, except the A/C was broken.  I was sitting next to the thermostat, so the manager talked to me.  Very nice and she gave us a free dessert.  I recommend."}
{"text":"Totally feels like a NY Pizza joint.  It really does!  My friend and I came to visit Grimaldi's on a Tuesday or Wednesday evening and there was a 20-30 minute wait.  No problem.  I kind of like when I get to a restaurant and there's a wait ... that's almost always a good sign.  We decided to sit at the bar instead.  There was just one other patron dining at the bar.  The single man had a Grimaldi House salad, The Don in a small size and a bottle of white wine.  My friend and I followed his lead, we ordered everything the same except we ordered red wine instead of white.    The Grimaldi House Salad is huge, it's definitely worth sharing with a friend.  The Don was AMAZING!!!  It was so damn good.  It came out piping hot, super cheesy, the ingredients are super fresh!  My friend and I were on our second serving of salad when our pizza came out.  The was nice.  Although the restaurant was on a 20-30 minute wait, the food still came out quick!  Definitely a plus!  We skipped dessert because we were full.  Everything was so filling. Next time we're gonna try some."}
{"text":"Pizza crust was excellent! Place was very clean  Hostess was friendly and helpful. This is the extent of the good.  Bad ... over-priced, waitress/bartender was rude when I asked a question on the menu - then ignored us, pizza was BLAND/TASTELESS - also the canned mushrooms and ham were very watery.  I wanted to like this place - I have driven past it hundreds of times wanting to stop ... I will not be back.  When we left, I handed the hostess a comment card with my concerns. I expressed to her to please make sure the GM sees it. She said OK. However, no attempt to maybe get a manager then or ask for contact information - found that to be a form of poor customer service."}
{"text":"2nd time here, not as good as the first visit. Pizza was under cooked in the middle and seed to have very little red sauce, almost none . Preferred the Caesar salad over the Grimaldi's green salad. Service ALWAYS good here!!!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER - I grew up on NY/NJ pizza and this is the best you'll get in the state of AZ.  Don't even bother with anyplace else."}
{"text":"Love the pizza!  Good location and really nice place to go for dinner without breaking the bank.  Been here several times and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I'm usually skeptical about chain restaurant pizza. However, Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a different story. I haven't been to their original Brooklyn location, so i'm not sure how true they stay to their original recipe. However, I do know good pizza when I taste it and Grimaldi's in Las Vegas is excellent.   The pizza at Grimaldi's is prototypical NY style pizza with a thinner crust. The crust is thin and airy, but still maintains its structural integrity without being bogged down by toppings. In addition to the traditional red sauce, you have the option of getting white garlic or pesto pizza. Our group of 4 shared 2 large (18  inch) pizzas, one traditional and one white garlic. My favorite pizza was the red sauce meatball pizza. It was addictive. I wasn't as big of a fan of the white garlic pizza.   Surprisingly, I don't believe there is any price inflation at this Las Vegas location and the prices are similar to other Grimaldi's. It is actually pretty affordable in comparison to other sit-down restaurants on the strip. A large pizza is $16 and consists of 8 slices. Toppings are extra and run you $2-4 each.  We also ordered a large salad to share and a few beers. We ended up paying around $25  each, which was a steal since we were all stuffed afterwards. Grimaldi's is a definitely a good option if you're looking for a casual, low-key sit-down restaurant on the strip that does not break the bank."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience last visit and the manager fixed it. He invited me back in. The lunch specials are a great deal. I absolutely love the pizza. Service was a little slow but was in no hurry. And it was way better than last time! I appreciate fixing mistakes. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"12/26/2015  We got the garden large w/ spicy sausage.  Licked the plate after the last slice. A little pricey for a large ($30), but definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese pizza, and was shocked to find out that it was bland! I tasted the sauce on its own, and there was very little seasoning. It tasted ok with salt, hot pepper, and parmesan, but when was the last time you added salt to a pizza? It was a first for me.   I always rate a pizza place by their cheese pizza.(Yes, I am an East Coast transplant.) After all, you put enough toppings on, and even cardboard tastes good. I doubt that I will be returning, despite the friendly server."}
{"text":"We just moved to San Diego from Scottsdale and we miss Grimaldis SOOO much. We got it every single Sunday night for the last ten or so years. If you are near a Grimaldis and haven't ever tried it, run don't walk to your nearest one. Everything on their menu is amazing: salads, calzones, pizzas, everything. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to stop in for diner after we were walking down the street in Old Town Scottsdale. The wonderful smell brought us in. This is a pizza and salad place only. They only serve NY style thin crust pizza. We ordered a bottle of wine, a small Caesar salad (feeds 2) and a small Margarhita Pizza (6 slices).  It was delicious. The crust was flavorful and the sauce was just the right consistency. Bryan the manager was super nice and I liked our waitress Monique. Very attentive wait staff full of helpful suggestions. Great place!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is my favorite pizza. The staff is always pleasant and attentive. I love the brick oven cooked pizza. Their crust is thin and has just enough crisp to it. I prefer the white pizza that they make. I am not fond of pizza sauce so I'm really glad they have an alternative.   Although they are on the high end of pricing I feel it's worth every penny. My husband and I usually get a large white pizza with sausage and mushroom, which is AMAZING! We always end up with leftovers for lunch the next day and it is still good, even cold."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this pizza. We ordered a large mushroom pizza and there couldn't have been more than 4 mushrooms on the entire pizza. It was also lacking cheese. Plenty of sauce!  And why was the waiter wanting to package up our food, first the salad and then the pizza before we could even finish it?  We got rushed the entire meal!  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Any time a manager or owner reaches out to me after a bad review I give them an extra star for following up and being aware of their reputation. This is what this extra star is for."}
{"text":"First off, a whole star for having Layer Cake Primitivo. Second, a whole star for a carafe of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo for 15 bucks!!! Oh and yeah, the pizza was really good too! Apparently, they have a scientific way of replicating Brooklyn water to make the crust authentic. Whatever they are doing it is working. I was sad to see that no one was in the place on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. We had the entire restaurant to ourselves but the music was great, think old school Frank and Dino, and the decor was complete with red checkered table cloths.  Please go to this location during the day, they totally need it and it is worth the have a \"private serving.\""}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Reminds me of a good NYC pizza. I miss the city and the food. Best yet, Grimaldi's is pet friendly and their service is stellar"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever eaten, hands down! The homemade, freshsauce, cheese and dough is delicious. We go out of our way to eat here when we're in Vegas. Takes a while to cook, but worth it!! Salads are great, too!"}
{"text":"Solid 4-star pizza joint! We had great service and the marg pizza was Delish! For Vegas is was VERY reasonable and in a nice restaurant setting too."}
{"text":"Pizza just doesn't get any better than this. Though we have traded in the 120 degree heat and urban sprawl of Phoenix for the green and walkable goodness of Portland, I will always look back fondly on Grimaldi's as one of the brightest stars in the dark void representing palatable food to be found in Phoenix.   To be sure, there are better restaurants in Phoenix -- but there are no better pizzas. The topping choices are simple and down-to-earth (no pineapple here!), the way a pizza should be: oven roasted sweet red peppers, ricotta cheese (to die for), sun dried or fresh sliced tomatoes, pepperoni, onions, fresh garlic, Italian sausage, meatballs, pesto, mushrooms, and extras of their base ingredients: mozzarella cheese, basil, and \"Grimaldi's Famous Sauce.\" With these kinds of ingredients, you really cannot go wrong, so have fun picking and choosing!  While we like the \"white\" pizzas with garlic the best, it's not the sauce that makes the difference -- it's the deep, smoky taste of the coal brick oven baked into the thin crust and substantially portioned ingredients. Individual flavors bursting forth from a common shroud of fire.  Grimaldi's also offers a selection of starters, including antipasto and a variety of reasonably priced salads; some hot and cold beverages, including beer; and a few East Coast style desserts like \"New York Style\" cheesecake, cannoli, oreo cookie (invented in NYC in 1912), and tiramisu.    Of course, all the East Coast style pizza and desserts in the world won't change Scottsdale, AZ, into New York City. Indeed, Patsy Grimaldi's exceeds its New York counterparts by catering to the Scottsdale public and providing finer and more spacious dining areas, both inside and out. Service is prompt and always agreeable, even when things get busy. Speaking of which, be sure to make a reservation for larger dinner parties, especially on the weekend.  Though we've left the desert for greener lands, I'm not sure we'll find a local pizza joint that will compare. Goodbye Grimaldi's, we'll miss you."}
{"text":"good pizza but wanted people to know that Grimaldi's is listed under dog friendly on Yelp here but they will only let you put yr dog at one table near an exit gate and you have to leave your dog on the outside of the gate. so not really dog friendly."}
{"text":"My fiance and I wanted something to eat before seeing The Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian. After looking through 24/7 Vegas, we discovered that there was a NY Style pizza joint in The Palazzo.   We ordered a small (16\") cheese pizza, which contained six slices. Normally, my fiance is not a big pizza fan; she's usually full after one slice (i.e. loses her appetite). However, she enjoyed the pizza here; she ate half of it. Everything on the pizza worked, from the crust to the sauce to the cheese. I haven't been to their original, New York, location. But, the pizza here tasted similar to other pizza joints I ate at in New York.  Next time, we will try the white and/or pesto pizza."}
{"text":"Conveniently located inside the mall so I like the fact I can go shopping and then eat pizza. It is also next to california pizza kitchen so it is a tough decision. The pizza is....good. Not great, but good. And it's worth giving a try when you want pizza. I ordered a small pepperoni and cheese pizza. There are other things you can put on it but I'm a pretty boring eater. A good place to go with if you have a group of friends. Also a relatively classy place when compared to something like dominos. If you want pizza, try it out."}
{"text":"Eating at Grimaldis, I never had a bad experience. I believe this is the best location in Las Vegas. Very convenient. The food is great, it's small inside but they are never really busy. They have really tasty pizza. The menu isn't very big which is a plus ( makes it easier to order)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and each time I really enjoyed my experience. They have a nice outside seating area, where I sat the first time I was there. I got the Mediterranean salad as a starter, the large was definitely big enough to split between 3 people. And then I got a large sized pizza, it was enough to have a little left over.   I went because apparently it's National Pizza Day, and wanted to participate :). I love the inside of this place, it is clean and cozy. I got a small house salad, which was big enough to split between the two of us and then we got a large pizza!  I really like that you build your own pizza. I want to try a calzone next because if it's anything like their pizza it has to be good."}
{"text":"Having the manager message you and offer a free pizza because it was cold the first time you took it home? BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Like I said before; the pizza is delicious! We love coming here!  Fresh veggies and ingredients- wish they had avocado (hint hint) ;)  Check out the courtyard, but sitting in is good too!"}
{"text":"The family and I were at the Scottsdale Quarter a couple of weeks ago just walking around looking for a place to eat so we decided to try Grimaldi's. It was on. Sunday at around 2:00pm and it was not very crowded at all. Most of the patio tables were occupied, but inside was somewhat empty. When we walked up to the host/hostess stand we told them we wanted a table for four, two adults and two young children. We were immediately told that there would be a 30 minute wait because the pizza ovens were at capacity so they could not seat anymore tables. That was a first for me. Half the inside was empty, the patio was 95% occupied, not incredibly busy at all, but the ovens were at capacity??? I guess I had \"Gullible Idiot\" written across my forehead or something. It was obvious that they had other issues going on, either short of staff or something else, but at least tell the truth. A pizza restaurant half empty and the ovens are full... yeah fine, if you don't want our business that is fine. End result... I was so turned off by the treatment and attitude of the guy who handled us I just walked out. No way to treat a family at all. There are plenty of other places worthy of my money that appreciate my business. Hey Grimaldi's, get your act together if you are not planning in turning away more business in the future. I personally will not attempt a second time."}
{"text":"Yep. Everything you read it's a really nice place specially the one on Eastern Avenue. I really like sitting outside. Even though everyone thinks I'm Canadian because it's only 60°."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas being the meatball pizza was ruined.  Grimaldis decided to change product and it is no where near the same as before, nor do they care.  This is what Happens when a quality product company decides to go national!  They cut cost wherever hey can!"}
{"text":"I have never been to Grimaldi's before and I must confess I thought it was an ice cream place. Thought it was weird that it was right next to another ice cream place in the same shopping center. This is a very fancy shopping center. The whole place is decked out. Almost feel like you took a wrong turn and ended up in Scottsdale. But as I learned this is a pizza place. That is all they do. Except for a few salads and some deserts the only thing on the menu is pizza and calzones. Which is great. If you do something really well stick with it. Don't try and do a bunch of stuff and end up being sub par because of it. It is not that big of a place. Smaller than I thought. But it has a nice decor. Old school New York pictures everywhere and wine bottles turned into lights. We were seated and our server Jess was right over to help us out. She asked if we had ever been there before after we said no this was our first time she proceeded to explain how things work. Everything is build your own. You pick your size, whether you want regular or white pizza and then add whatever toppings you want. Toppings are extra. We ordered drinks and she brought them right out. Then we ordered a peperoni and Italian sausage calzone and a spinach and meatball pizza. After a good pizza baking time another server brought out the calzone and then Jess brought over the pizza. She informed us as she put it down that she had accidentally put Italian sausage on the pizza as well. She was going to let us have this pizza while they made another one for us but we said it was fine and she told us they would not charge us for the extra topping. Little mistake but she handled it very well. Both the pizza and calzone were very good. Wasn't expecting such a thin crust on the pizza. This is not fold in half pizza. Overall it is very good. Not to expensive unless you go nuts with toppings. Jess was very nice and pretty cute. I like the simple menu too. I would go here again."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's didn't disappoint! Me and my husband went in for dinner with our 3 kids on a Tuesday evening. The pizza was amazing and the service was fantastic. Our waiter was always quick to help us and provided a through explanation of how Grimaldi's pizza is made with quality ingredients. We were looking for a more kid friendly local pizza joint and Grimaldi's, while not kid UNfriendly was just not the family atmosphere we were looking for that evening. However, We will definitely return when we are wanting a more upscale pizza dinner!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place! I usually get pepperoni, mushroom and fresh sliced tomatoes as toppings. The salads are good as well. Be sure to join the mailing list. They send you a coupon for joining and also send a coupon for a free large 1 toping pizza for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Service could have been a little friendlier, but overall an excellent pizza spot."}
{"text":"I have been to Grimaldi's Pizzeria twice... Was never a fan. Please note that I haven't been to Grimaldi's since I moved to Arizona. We went there for lunch recently, and while I wasn't blown away, I was more impressed than I remember. There were 6 of us, and we ordered 2 large salads and 2 large pizzas. It was the perfect amount of food, too. The salads are great... Maybe better than the pizza! Oh, and if you have a large group, the large pizza is only $2 more. I won't be rushing to go back, but I was more impressed than I expected to be. Oh, and it's coal oven!!!"}
{"text":"Very good thin crust pizza. You can watch them make it too!  I had thin crust with pepperoni and jalapenos. My husband had a calzone it was huge and he enjoyed it! The toppings are expensive though but I guess that's vegas!"}
{"text":"Thank you David and Rebekah for such amazing customer service! Your hospitality is very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group on Saturday night. The back patio is very nice especially with the lights. The pizzas were great. Crispy crust and served hot. Service was great. Something happened while at the restaurant but it was not their fault or anything that they could have controlled. But still they comped our most expensive pizza. Definitely appreciated the service."}
{"text":"I had dinner here on 07/03/16 with my GF.  We ordered the SMALL Don's pizza with mushrooms and x-tra Mozz.  Wow! This pizza is huge and a \"tiny\" would have been plenty for two.  This \"small\" is a normal large or x-tra large in most restaurants.  It was loaded with sausage, cheese and all the toppings. Very DEE-LISH!  Service was great as well.  I wholeheartedly recommend Grimaldi's for lunch or dinner.  Be prepared to come hungry."}
{"text":"i travel from the other side of town for their white pizza.  It's da bomb!!! The other location in summerlin is not as good. Always love Grimaldi's!!!!"}
{"text":"This is great place for a sit down pizza and wine dinner! I have been here numerous times and have never been let down. I will continue to bring friends and family when they come to visit."}
{"text":"Tremendous tasting thin crust pizza, possibly the best ever. We had the margherita, and a pepperoni and sausage pizza, and both were 5 stars. Very reasonable prices, and great service.  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and welcoming & the inside of restaurant is beautiful especially where we sit next to giant chandelier decoration that I believe is part of the casino but it's beautiful. It is the Best Pizza Ever!!!!  Oh and their Ceasar salad is delicious as well!  We always stop here when we're in Vegas and right before we head back home. It's always our last meal.   Highly recommend for Pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm!! I love this pizza and the calzones! I wish the location on Alma School didn't close down. It's ok tho, it's worth the drive. I don't always eat pizza, but when I do, it's Grimaldi's. The service isn't bad either."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for pizza before our flight out of Las Vegas.  After winding thru the shops, we found the restaurant tucked away.    Lunchtime, quiet and very few guests. Our server approached, introduced herself and asked our drink order.  Shortly after, she was back and we were ready to eat!  Two pepperoni pizzas, cheese pizza and wedge salad was our order.  The salad came first and was plenty for three people to share with a nice serving.  The pizza was next, hot and crispy.  Light on the sauce and heavy on the mozzarella- not shredded but melted in bits all over the pizza, mmmm!  We took leftovers for the plane, can't wait to eat again later for a snack.  Good pizza, good company, nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"Love the crispy crust and the quality ingredients. Parking is never great in old town but it's worth the struggle to get served here."}
{"text":"We've been to Grimaldi's several times and every time it's just as fabulous as it was the last time.  Their pizza is, by far, my favorite in the valley and is always consistently good.  They have an excellent by the glass or bottle wine list and their beer selection is also good.  They have an excellent Caprese salad that we like to have as an appetizer before our pizza.  Their menu is small, mainly pizza and a few salads, so if you are looking for a place with lots of choices (pastas, sandwiches, etc) Grimaldi's may not be the place for you.  But if you are looking for amazing pizza, I would highly recommend giving Grimaldi's a try.  One thing to keep in mind:  weekend evenings can be very busy, so I suggest going at slightly off times or bringing a dose of patience."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza!!  Its not traditional NY pizza but its amazingly good!  Coal brick oven pizza and plus they make their own cheese which you can taste the freshness.  I'm not a fan of greasy food and this place works well with my cheat days while I'm dieting.  The salads are super good too!"}
{"text":"My best friend and our babies (mine is 2 and hers is 6 months) came to have lunch and a glass of wine on the patio. We sat for about 15-20 minutes and no one came to grab our drink order yet. We had to go inside to ask if they forgot about us. They did. That's ok we have both worked as servers before and we get that it was an honest mistake. However the way the management handled it was amazing. He personally came out and told us he was buying our lunch and apologized. He was so sweet wish I had gotten his name. Our waitress was also really nice and accommodating! They did not have to do that but they did. Not only will the food keep us coming back but their customer service as well! Thanks again Grimaldi's you guys have what a lot of places are lacking!"}
{"text":"How can I describe the best D$%m gluten free pizza....... I have searched high and low and FINALLY Grimaldi's at the Scottsdale Quarter got it right! My husband is a restaurant manager so anywhere we go he critiques the service and the food. The manager Brian came over to great us, and also the co manager Kevin. I feel bad j don't remember our servers name but she rocked it 5 star service and food. Thank you so much to all the staff on Tuesday the 31st for making our date night memorable. I can't figure out if it's a good thing that I live walking distance away but at least I get the best gluten free pizza in town"}
{"text":"Hands down super good pizza salads are great as well never have i had a bad experience here love this place. Just don't show up at 4pm oven is being cleaned until 5pm. Nice staff clean place wish it wasn't so far."}
{"text":"The pizza smelled wonderful as we neared the joint. My fiancee immediately decided that we needed to eat there! Plenty of seating,  no wait! We were waited on promptly. Having just walked over 3 miles to get where we were I only wanted water to drink. Gail ordered white Sangria. While I cannot confirm this,  the Sangria looked and tasted like white wine with a no-sugar-added fruit cocktail cup dumped in it.  It took a few trips past the table before the server realized my water was empty. Pizza was phenomenal though! After a bit my water never went dry. If not for the Sangria the rating would be higher."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now... once for a casual dinner and another due to a (my) birthday certificate. Both times service has been exceptionally awesome. Actually, the hostess was even exceptionally kind and really set the tone for our dinner. Service is really the reason why this review is 4 stars.   The pizza is okay. Entirely too crunchy to be the NY style pizza that I love, that they claim to be. We actually looked up if Grimaldis actually started in NY because the menu doesn't show a NY location but there is NYC decor all over. This pizza would be so much better if it wasn't so crispy. But, perhaps that's just me. We also ordered the house salad...which could have used some cheese and croutons... but I get that it's different - just persona preference. Our server had no problem bringing us some croutons on the side.   The atmosphere is very Italian-y...cozy and enjoyable. The lighting is quite dim and the music plays softly. There's one or two tvs by the bar to enjoy as well. Their outdoor section was open during our visit, but it was too cold for me to enjoy it, ha! They do have heaters out there though.   There's a nice selection of wines, some beers, and a page of specialty cocktails. As far as food goes... you pretty much are limited to pizza and salad. Pretty straight to the point kind of place, which I can appreciate.   Just wish the crust wasn't so burnt."}
{"text":"At first we were excited since it was in our hotel Palazzo (2nd floor above Carnevino) and there was no wait and we loved it in NY. The decor was definitely nicer than NY location and the chandeliers made of wine bottles were beautiful! It was clean, nice and spacious. However the pizza was a disappointment. Nothing close to the original in NY!!!  Our crust was burnt (black edges) on almost half the pizza, but the dough was undercooked. Almost like a mushed hard pita. The sauce, pepperoni and sausage were all good, but I had ordered extra basil and I did NOT even taste ANY basil! The house salad was good, but the green olives were still raw and hard to bite into. Service was ok, but it was just a waste of stomach space considering vegas has so many other restaurants. If i'm going to eat Pizza, it has to be amazing. Not sure if we just got a bad batch, but if it's always served this way, then we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago so I am pretty picky about my pizza, but for a party of three we ordered one large pizza and an antipasti salad it it was the perfect amount of food and both were fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is so good and it never disappoints. I went to school down in Tucson and they just opened one near Arizona stadium, I screamed when I saw the sign for the one in Tucson I was so excited. Now I can have it whenever I want in Phoenix and Tucson!   The sauce is great so is the cheese and I always get pepperoni, which is awesome as well!  I also really like the croutons in the Caesar salad!"}
{"text":"Authentic pizza I love also the staff very friendly , world class quality meal the atmosphere also good and clean surroundings."}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast and a pizza snob. I haven't had good pizza since I moved here nearly 3 years ago. Well, let me tell you, this pizza is delicious!! While it's not exactly the same as NY pizza, it is the closest I've found.  Besides the pizza, try the kale salad... sooo good!! We were here on Mother's Day and it was busy. Service was great though for a holiday. Chris was our server and he was very knowledgeable and went above and beyond to provide excellent service. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I love love love Grimaldi's pizza so much. They know how to make the most delicious white pizza ever!"}
{"text":"Family favorite 5 years in a row when we pass through Las Vegas. Brick oven delight we cant wait to go back again! Great safe neighborhood."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's serves up an excellent New York-style thin crust pizza. We ordered a large (18\") with pepperoni, Italian sausage, onions, and jalapeños. The pizza also included fresh mozzarella, and basil. It was so good, that we finished all but one slice on premise -- we wouldn't  typically consume an entire large pizza in one seating.  The employees were friendly and the service was attentive.  Why not 5 stars? I've had tastier crusts in my lifetime, but when you consider that this is a large, well ran chain, and not your local artisan pizza nazi with a nightly line of groupies -- they are deserving of a solid 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the bartender who could teach the manager a thing or two about customer service. Joined the birthday club today, cool awesome pizza. Went in and told the bartender I joined the birthday club today, my birthday. Ordered, time to pay and didn't have a code for the pizza. I showed her the e-mail which is a generic $5.00 off next order. She couldn't honor, I spoke to the mgr. He said nope, not the same day, 72 hours. I asked where is this policy in writing on webpage, or e-mail he walked away and never came back. Seems trite over a birthday perk, pizza was done in box and the kitchen staff was thankful. So best to put in print Grimaldi's, maybe go over customer service 101 with your manager. I like your pizza, although there are so many other options in Scottdale."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice inside and has a outdoor seating area out front. My waitress was very friendly on my visit which is always a good sign.  The pizza choices are all build your own.  So it's more expensive than all the other pizza places around here.  If you go up past two toppings you would be far more expensive than any other place.  It also seems to take awhile for the pizza to come out.  One small personal pizza took about 25 min when they weren't very busy.  The pizza is okay with extra thin crust and very good mozzarella.  The sauce is a bit bland. It serves it's function for the pizza, but really doesn't add anything. It definitely needs something.  It's a nice place, but not something I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"It's NY Pizza!!  Right from Under the Brooklyn Bridge  Yelp wants me to write more, so you must visit this restaurant. You will enjoy every bite"}
{"text":"Best pizza west of the Brooklyn Bridge!!  The coal oven pizza is amazing  Great people and service  And it's close to the Apple Store"}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's and I'm definitely a frequent flyer here whenever I crave for pizza. Fresh, extremely fresh pizza, made to order, and THIN crust. I'm a huge fan of thin crust pizza!! Also for less than $20 you get a quality pizza!  I read that they bake their pizza using brick ovens, but with a special kind of coal called \"anthracite\" which is a more premium coal because it has a high carbon content and few impurities.   & since they originated in NYC and wanted to bring the same flavor to other cities, they do not use our water system here in the LV valley- instead they use the NYC water pumping system installed in every location to bring that flavor here.   First I will say, that the service at this location was a little below what I'm used to, normally get my pizza lightly cooked on the crust, because they normally bring it out a a little charred. I requested it but still got the charred crust. :(  If you like a little buttery crust, I recommend asking for it lightly cooked.   We order our pizza with basil (you can get it baked on top or after baking, so it's still \"raw,\" with pepperoni, and with italian sausage. Extra toppings of course cost a little more.   I haven't tried their desserts yet, since this location is in the palazzo, Bouchon bakery is soo close. So I ran right over there. :P  4/5 stars- because of the service at this location. Otherwise 5 stars for the awesomeness of the pizza!"}
{"text":"My company had Grimaldis cater for one of our meetings. I can't speak about the environment or service but I can say I've tried a bunch of variations of their pizza. In all honesty, their Meat lover's pizza was good but it was nothing special and same goes with their other pizzas. However, I'd only come back for their pesto pizza. It was absolutely delicious and the cheese they used was amazing.  All the other pizzas were good but not good enough for me to come back. I'd only come back for their pesto pizza. And I feel fat as hell since I ate 5 different slices, 2 of them were the pesto."}
{"text":"NY style pizza that is absolutely delicious!! Usually I get a lot of toppings but here I just get pepperoni and it's amazing! The sauce is light and the cheese is the best I've ever had on a pizza. It's not super cheesy and it appears to be clumps of cheese before they bake it instead of covering the pizza with shredded cheese. I could be wrong but that's how it looks.  The only thing I wish they would change is adding a few more items to the menu like garlic bread or something. Sometimes when you're super hungry you want an appetizer other than a salad. I'm used to it now and I'm prepared to wait, so I guess that's a good thing since I'm extra hungry when the pizza comes.  If you sign up for their email newsletter you get coupons for dine in visits. My favorite email from them, is a free pizza during your birthday month! Happy Birthday to me lol!"}
{"text":"Been there several times...reminds me of a little place I'd go when I lived in Sicily. Really has top notch food and wine. Amber helped us last time I was there. She was, professional, attentive and all her recommendations were fantastic. No photos because we ate it before I remembered I wanted to Yelp it! You won't regret trying anything on the menu. Last I had the Brooklyn Bridge, Chef's selection. Wines @ the table, 19 Crimes (Bold Red), Terra D'Oro (Moscato) & Banfi (Sparkling Rose). Hope that helps, Enjoy"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas without question.  Crust is thin and crispy from end to end and the sauces and toppings are super fresh.  We get the marinara sauce pizza with sausage and onion and it is mouth watering.  Apparently, their secret is the water in the dough and that is the reason it tastes so good.   They could benefit from adding a few other options on the menu though but if you are looking for a great NY style pizza then this is your place!  Great staff and waiters never disappoint."}
{"text":"Delicious!! This place is one of my favorites and I've always been completely satisified with everything I've ordered.  The service is great, always friendly and the NY pizza is very tasty!  Definitely worth a visit if you're in Old Town for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Had the worst server . Waited 20 minute for our drink order when asked our server he said he was too busy closing out 3 other tables . I told him thats not a good excuse ,he told me \" That's Reality \" people like that should not be in the Restaurant business . In addition he screwed up our order by not bringing a pie we ordered . And added a topping on our calzone we didnt order . Wasn't even that busy ."}
{"text":"i like everything that i've eaten here. (pizza, salads and deserts) TASTY!"}
{"text":"Went here on a bachelorette dinner with 9 other girls.  Location was super cute, the décor is inviting and looks cool.. Ambiance was nice too, considering we were a large group of 9 rowdy girls on a bachelorette trip.  Ordered 3 large salads which was more than enough for our group as well as 2 large pizza's.  Pizza was very good and lived up to the NYC standard of pizza.  Nice place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"When you walk into the Palazzo from the Wynn bridge, you will smell an awesome Italian-pizza-tomato sauce smell, and Grimaldi's is where it's coming from. After striking out at a few other places on Friday night, we remembered that smell and followed our noses.  It turned out to be a pretty good idea.    Pizzas are cooked to order in a wood-fired pizza oven.  It has standard Italian pizzeria decor and they can accommodate fairly large groups, as there are some bigger tables there.  Plus most of the seats have a pretty good view of the bridge entrance of the Palazzo.   The basic large pizza is what you get for a flat fee, and then each topping is a couple extra dollars.  If you keep it simple, it is very affordable.  Like a proper pizza, everything is thin crust. They only have traditional toppings, like pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, et cetera - you won't find any pineapples here!  The cheese is real pieces of fresh mozzarella, not shredded generic cheese.  So you won't have complete cheese coverage, but it will be great.  The salads you can order are also family style and fairly large.  They are worth it.   Overall if you are looking for an affordable,simple, and tasty pizza, this place is a good bet."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my experience as I had heard such wonderful things about this pizzeria.   The Caprese salad: tomato was not ripe, dry and flavorless   Pizza: cheese pizza. Crust was thin and crisp with the right amount of char. Dry not chewy. But over all very good.  Sauce was good. A sweeter tomato sauce but nothing to it. No salt, garlic, organo. Nothing.  Cheese was sparse and rubbery.   Service: I asked our waitress a few questions about different items on the menu and she had no idea. She have me the wrong answer a few times and when I pressed she checked and she was wrong. Don't guess if you don\"t"}
{"text":"Food is great. Staff are amazingly kind without trying. In a town that prides it's self on hospitality they are a stand out. Loved by locals and loved by me. They suggest without selling. Love this place"}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. Pizza was soggy in the middle. Very disappointing because I really wanted it to be good. Tasted ok but just not \"wow\" that was good. Unlikely to return as so many better options"}
{"text":"We went with a party of 6. Order two large pizzas and a large salad. It was about $75. The pizza special-buffalo chicken pizza was so tasty. The cheese used on that one was blue cheese and it was so good - $22 dollars  We also customize a large pizza with Basil, bacon, mushroom, and fresh tomatoes with pesto base. - about 32 dollars (the toppings were added on to the $18 dollars base)   It was nice!"}
{"text":"Amazing delicious pizza. Went to the place and took a pizza for take out. Was so y my brother and father came and got a slice too. The guy making the pizza was very nice. Pablo or Paulo as far as I remember.."}
{"text":"Whenever I visit the NYC area I always mean to try Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. After having visited Manhattan several times I never made it out there. Not even when I visit Brooklyn. So while visiting in-laws in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area I was ecstatic to see that I had a few locations while browsing through restaurant options out here.   With all the hype surrounding these famous pies I really hope it is the NYC water because quite frankly I was not that impressed with the Grimaldi's of Scottsdale. Or perhaps the entire Grimaldi's hype is generated by the novelty of it all. I don't know.   My personal opinions on their pizza:  -The crust was a tad too crispy for my liking -Flavoring was a bit on the bland side. I rarely ever use salt but I almost felt like dousing my slices with salt.  -Fresh ingredients (in particular the mozzarella) were used on the pizza  The four of us aren't heavy eaters so the large (18\" with 8 slices) was enough to feed us. The Mediterranean salad (I say skip the salad) was simple and came pre-tossed with salad dressing in the large bowl.   The service: -Our server was great. She was quick, efficient and kept everything flowing smoothly -waters were constantly refilled and used plates cleared quickly replaced by cleans ones   I guess I really do have to make it to their original location one day. OR perhaps their Limelight Market location in the Flatiron will taste similar...? I'm not sure I'm willing to dedicate an entire afternoon to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge, brave that famously insane line only to consume some mediocre pizza. Ugh. This is why I dislike hype around restaurants. I'm always intrigued and most of the time end up disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty Damn great pizza. Aside from casa bianca. Pizza here was great!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Went here on a Thursday night with a party of seven.  We were told it would be 45 minutes before we were seated.  After an hour had passed and seeing multiple tables open, we said we would take two tables next to each other.  Once we were seated, we were In the process of putting the two tables together and the staff proceeded to tell us that we could not put the tables together, while the group to our left had clearly put two tables together (and were separated once they left).  And I'm not sure why, but they had the air conditioner on in the restaurant even though it was below 60 degrees outside.  Can't say I expect to have to wear a jacket inside a restaurant.  The pizza is pretty good, but certainly not worth the headache of dealing the with overall incompetence of the staff at this location.  If you must have it, I'd order it to go.  I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza was good. It deserved a recommendation. However, there are 2 points that need to be considered. (1) We were seated by the hostess and waited 15 min before I called over a waiter and was told that he was not my waiter. He took the orders and sent for my waiter. 5 min later he showed up and from then on it was fine. (2) For a large pizza with 3 toppings $24 was on the high side but was comparable to Metro Pizza which charged slightly more but gave less toppings per pizza. Putting it in perspective, a good dish at a good Italian restaurant cost about $25. Overall, I would go back for their thin crust pizza despite the slow service and pricey charge, because it was good."}
{"text":"4 words...  BEST PIZZA IN ARIZONA!  Patsy's was my favorite pizza place in NYC and when I moved to Scottsdale two years ago, I was afraid I would never have good pizza until I went back east...Needless to say, I was excited when I found this jewel the day I moved here!!"}
{"text":"We popped in right before closing - I know, we were \"those guys\" - but the staff were still welcoming and helpful!   We shared a large Don as well as a large house salad among three people. This was an almost perfect portion, we had a few bites left of the salad remaining.   The Don was pretty solid! Good meat to cheese ratio given that all of Grimaldi's pizzas are thin crust. The bottom was just a tad too burnt for my taste. However, the house salad had far too much dressing. I know that personally I usually lean towards light dressing, but even the guys agreed that the greens should not be literally dripping! Not terrible for a sit down, quick bite, but definitely recommend being careful with the salad."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town!  Great service and food came out quickly, especially on a busy Friday night.  Our server Cesar was courteous and professional. You gotta try this place if you love good pizza."}
{"text":"Hey hey hey my peeps this is the best Brick oven pizza . Great place to celebrate Birthdays, Bridal  showers, baby showers etc! If you go let me know what you think . Enjoy"}
{"text":"We got the Mediterranean salad and large pizza with roasted red peppers, mushroom, and extra basil- our favorite toppings!  They have a good selection of wine.  Sign up for their emails to get a free large pizza during your birthday week!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a nice treat!  We have been many times to the older location on S. Eastern and once to the new location on Rampart.  I am always very please with the pizza and have almost no complaints in that department, but service just never seems to be very good there...  I, lol, drink a lot of Ice Tea when we go out to eat, so that being said, all I ask is that my Ice be filled up when it gets low...  I think I consider myself to be a good tipper, and my expectations are pretty simple, keep my tea filled and check on us once in awhile...sounds easy enough?  Anyways we like eating here and will continue to do so for sometime to come, once service is better this would def be a 5 star review!!"}
{"text":"I asked pizza without garlic, but the waiter brought with. I had a stomachache after only one bite. I can't eat garlic. Please, waiters listen what customers ask for."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We stopped by during the week. Decided on a meatball pizza and Mediterranean salad. Both were delicious! Great service! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the BEST pizza I've had in a very long time! I loved that a small piece of dough was provided to keep the kids busy while waiting for the food. We ordered a 16\" traditional pizza which feed 3 people. The salad was HUGE and could feed 3 people as well. Definitely and amazing experience with great customer service."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic pizza!   We happened to be driving by around 8 p.m. and noticed that there were a lot of people in the restaurant, which is usually a pretty good indication that it's a good place to eat.  Well, we weren't disappointed.    Thin crust pizza with delicious ingredients.  Luckily, we ordered a large and it was large!  We took home quite a bit and enjoyed the leftovers for the next couple of days.  We would definitely do that again.  I must mention the Greek Salad we had - HUGE!  The ingredients were super fresh and it was just heavenly.  One of the best Greek Salads I've ever had.  We saw a Caesar Salad go by and it, too, was huge and looked delicious.  We'll be trying that one out next time.  The service was exceptional as the gal that waited on us was full of personality and very helpful with information on the restaurant, as well as the food.   I highly recommend Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Never a bad experience here.  Everything we've had has been good, including the service.  Good drink selection, tasty salads, flavorful pizza (and I'm usually not a thin-crust fan, coming from Chicago), and friendly service.  It's always seemed busy in there, which I guess is a good thing which shows that others think highly of them as well, but we've never had to wait long to be seated.  We'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Always great service and pizza. Always our go to place for special family events. Love that you can now get on the waiting list via Yelp."}
{"text":"We come here often for lunch and dinners with the whole family. Service is always friendly and fast. My only complaint is that they re brick their oven and the most random times and it's down for like a hour when they do it. So if you go for lunch give them a call and make sure the oven is up running and hot. Lunch special is decent you get a good size Cesar or house salad and a personalized one topping pizza and a soft drink for for 9.95 . Restaurant is always very clean and manger checks on you.   ***** another 5 stars for you guys! Just dined in for dinner. Wait wasn't long for it being Friday about 35 Minutes. They use a cellphone system they call or text when your table is ready. Which is nice because you can walk around the Park West shopping center. Our server tonight was Jake and he was very personable and fast. He was great with kids and their request for the fun dough. Kept our drinks full and was speedy with bar drinks. Salads came out fast cold and crisp. Pizza came hot and amazing as always. Ask for yummie garlic powered it gives the pizza that zing! We will continue to dine in! Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"We have been to Grimaldi's twice, and both times were outstanding! Their New York style pizza has a wonderfully crisp thin crust, with delicious and generous toppings. We like to share the small pizza, along with their very ample and tasty small salad.   They have friendly, attentive service with a smile. The restaurant is pleasantly decorated with loads of New York scenes.   We have taken friends to Grimaldi's and we recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Three things on the menu. Pizza, calzones and salads. That's it. All done very well, in a great atmosphere with attentive service.   The pizza menu has no suggestions, just a list of toppings, accordingly, you have... No meat lovers pizza.  Gotta make your own. No Margharitta Pizza. You select it. No BBQ chicken pizza. Figure it out and order it. No Veggie Pizza. Pick 'em yourself.  Of course, the list of toppings is ample, and you can design anything you want. We ordered a small pie with garlic and pepperoni. Also had a small salad. (FYI the salad menu does not require that you pick your own ingredients.)  They were having some oven temperature problems, but the staff was helpful and the manager took care of the issue. Bring the whole family."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed in this place!  I went one time previously and remembered it was ok, but after this last visit, I will not go back.  Their menu is extremely limited, so basically it's pizza, calzones & salad; that's it.  I am lactose intolerant, so I ordered a pizza with no cheese and mushrooms.  It was a personal pizza and all toppings are an additional $2-5, so my pizza was almost $14 (which I thought was pricey especially since it's very thin crust).  Now, I know you're thinking, how good can a pizza be without cheese?  Well, Settebello makes amazing cheese- less pizzas.    The amount of sauce on my pizza was absolutely ridiculous (way too much) & the bottom was burned.  It was awful; I would have rather eaten at Papa John's.  The other people with me, ordered 'normal' pizzas, and not one of them mentioned how great they thought it was.  The other thing that pissed me off was I ordered coffee.  They only serve Americano or Espresso, so I ordered the Americano.  It was in a tiny cup and was very average, expensive and NO refills.  Ok, how does an Italian joint not serve just plain coffee?????  I will order coffee at the most random restaurants and they have it & it's usually decent.  I would NOT go back & it's pricey.  Save yourself the disappointment and go to Settebello!  Oh, and on a side note, I would have selected '0' stars if that were an option."}
{"text":"Step 1: After attending an event with very little to eat, I saw someone with a pizza box from Grimaldi's.    Step 2. While wondering, \"could this be related to 'the' Grimaldi's from NY\" I quickly launched the Yelp app on my iPhone and found the location for Grimaldi's.   Step 3. I admitted my thankfulness that the restaurant was still open (thank you, Yelp, for telling me the hours).  Step 4. Walked to the restaurant, which wasn't too far from the hotel I was staying at. .  Step 5. Ordered a pizza.  This was probably the hardest part, due to the growing anticipation of deliciousness while waiting for a painful 20 minutes.  Gosh!  Step 6. Paid about $22 for a large (which isn't huge, but is decent) pizza and walked back to the hotel.  Step 7: Ate an amazing pizza by a gorgeous pool in Phoenix.  The cost and the wait were worth the price of admission.  Half pepperoni and half sausage.  Thin crust and brick oven baked.  YUM!  Step 8: Wrote this review after returning home, and am salivating at the thought of a pizza that is 3,000 miles away.  Perhaps it's worth a return trip to AZ :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza spot in Vegas, the coals make a world of difference in the taste of the pizza, highly recommend when on this side of town!"}
{"text":"We love this pizza! It is thin crust and not greasy with excellent flavor! We were sad when the Ocotillo location closed, but this location isn't too far from our house. We will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Grimaldis has a nice atmosphere and the pizza is good but so are many other pizza places throughout the valley and for about 1/2 the price. In fact a simple trip to \"Slices\" at Desert Ridge can get you a better tasting slice of pizza for a couple bucks. I had to vote I like it because I didnt hate it but seriously whats the big deal. Again many better tasting Pizzas out there that dont make you feel like you've just been robbed as you walk out the door."}
{"text":"it was rather speedy for pizza-which was nice because we were a bit hungry. Not your typical pizza. the cheeses used are different and less common on this side of the world (I guess lol)... it was almost like goat cheese. The crust texture was very nice. Very garlic-kee... (which I liked). Not sure that Id return, but had a great experience. the staff was all smiles, happy, and nice. pricing was very reasonable for the strip. (sadly, wasnt really fond of the wine suggestions :("}
{"text":"BEST pizza. Half price wine Tuesdays! Try the meritage; it's only available at Grimaldis and is great chilled. Pesto pizza w pepperoni is awesome!  Oh and cheesecake... I can't I shouldn't I did. And I did it again."}
{"text":"The experience was terrible I will not come back.... I recommend keep walking.... Service behind the pizza was rude, short spoken, n in professional...."}
{"text":"The name \"New York Pizza\" conjures up a predictable image in the heads of most people, and to those lucky enough, an intense and blissful memory.  This kind of pizza, large, floppy and often sold by the slice has been imitated in one way or another in every corner of the country to mixed results.    But there is another sort of New York pizza that predates the style most (New Yorkers included) are familiar with. It's the kind of pizza made in a small handful of ancient pizzerias in New York city like Lomardi's, Grimaldi's and Totono's. It's thin crusted with a sweet tomato sauce and a dusting of parmesan and/or romano, some dried oregano and fresh basil and a generous drizzle of olive oil. Mozzarella is used sparingly, about half as much as you'd expect. This is the style of the very first pizzas made in America by Neapolitan immigrants.  The distinguishing factor today is the once-common coal-fired brick oven running about 900 degrees that's capable of charring the crust before it browns the cheese.  The result is a striking palette of black, light brown, white, dark green and about five shades of red.  I've never been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but I have been to Totono's. And this style, the so-called New York Neapolitan, was one I thought I could only score in NYC.  Through the magic of Yelp, I found this improbable outpost while looking for a hassle-free, off the strip locale for a family dinner. Problem is, I talk too much and felt the need to find a real gem.  This couldn't have been easier.  I was shocked to see that NYC's favorite pizzeria had franchised, but this looks like a small chain run by a nephew of the original owner, with his blessings, assistance and recipes.    We were quickly seated through the help of a call-ahead quasi-reservation at the best table in the house, right next to the pizza prep station.  The pies were nearly flawless.  I went with extra basil and I sampled the pepperoni and sausage. There were six of us, all northeast natives, two of which have lived in Italy, and all of us ranked this as our favorite or near-favorite pizza ever.  Is it my favorite?  I'm not sure, but it's 2nd or third at worst.  It has to be the best in Vegas and it will be a mandatory stop every time I'm in town.  They don't have a line out the door yet, so check it out before the word spreads.  Service is attentive and polite, which isn't very \"East Coast\" of them, but that's one part of back home that I don't miss. Five mother-f'n stars."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMMY!  There are TWO Grimaldi's on the Strip (but 5 total in LV) - one in Fashion Mall and one in Palazzo. Apparently, they will be opening one in El Segundo, CA!   You order based on size and toppings are extra ($2 or more).   Ambiance was super cozy (dim lighting, red checkered table cloth, little candle) and service was super attentive! We ordered a medium margherita pizza and it was enough to fill the both of us with one slice as leftover. It was delicious ... thin crust but a little chewy with fresh mozzarella ... oh I'm in  heaven and I want to go back!!!  We were so happy with our meal, that we ordered tiramisu for dessert. It was divine ... not too sweet, I wanted to order a 2nd one!!! =)  Definitely stop by on the way -- I think it's much better than Secret Pizza (although, SP allows pizza by the slice but you must order a whole pizza here)."}
{"text":"If you like thin crust pizza with fresh toppings this is the place for you.  Salad is tasty with sweet peppers.  It's in the mall which could be good or bad, but I personally love this pizza.  Recommend a half garlic half tomato sauce pizza for first timers to taste both.  I like garlic white sauce more!"}
{"text":"White pizza with garlic is amazing! Always a great ambiance here and great service. The manager Joann stopped by the table both times I've been to make sure everything tasted great. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's was a vivid part of my NYC vibe, and then I moved away from the east coast and forgot about the chain for a little while. Suddenly on trips to various cities, I was surprised to see the brick and mortar locations popping up everywhere. I dont know why I am surprised to see it in Vegas- where all well known restaurants tend to franchise and take hold. While Grimaldi's was not on the official eating agenda, we were in Vegas on Easter and it was one of the only places on our side of the strip that was open.  I wish I was not hungover and having a very rough morning- I know this is delicious pizza and would have liked to enjoy it more. Instead, I chewed on the bland complimentary bread and took nibbles at my crust and some of the marinara sauce. It was proclaimed as amazing pizza by my friends, who fared the morning better than I. I remembered it as such, and since I think they did a great job in replicating the NYC original- here's 4 stars to those more sober memories of Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm, not bad! Lots of potential.   The idea of a little fresh basil was a pleasant surprise.   I'm all about brick oven pizza but mine was a little \"well done\" (burnt) and the crust was too too thin for the 3 toppings I had. I love love love NY Style pizza, this crust was super paper thin."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's...Grimaldi's....Grimaldi's! I have to say that I have found a new love. This is probably the closest I have come to New York style down here...and I love my New York style pizza!    To start off with, YOU pick what sauce you want..which is a blessing because everyone is different. I like that you get to create your own pizza and not stuck to the normal toppings. I get irritated when I go out for pizza and have to pay extra to add toppings or remove them completely and create a whole new creation!    We went for the simple red sauce with sausage and mushrooms just to be safe. The sauce truly stands out! It is very simple, not overly sweet like a lot of chain pizza places. I loved the simplicity of it! The cheese was very good as well, higher quality than most. We loved it. Crust was perfect, sauce perfect, toppings perfect! I can't wait to go back and try the pesto with ricotta and spinach! We had the house salad and it was very good as well. We will most definitely be coming here often when we visit.     You know it is good when all of the people living in the townhouses close are walking over and getting to go."}
{"text":"Very casual pizzeria, great for groups and family. Nothing too complicated, just pick the size of your pizza, the toppings you like, and enjoy the pizza.  My group ordered a large 18in. pizza with the following: Tomato sauce, parmesan cheese, kalamata olives, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and roasted red peppers.  The hearty topping provided great flavors to the pizza; while the thin crust provided a great crunchy texture.  The way they baked the thin crust was well balanced. Portions of the crust were crunchy, while other portions were slightly softened by the moist topping.  Overall, a great casual pizzeria that is more than able to fulfill one's pizza cravings."}
{"text":"Just had a very nice lunch stop at this busy Scottsdale location. My wife and I sat at the bar. She had a red sangria which she said was fruity but not too sweet. I enjoyed an ice cold Peroni draft. We ordered a cheese pizza which came out of the brick oven hot and bubbly. Very tasty with fresh ingredients. Recommend."}
{"text":"Price of a pizza was 12$ for a cheese, added mushrooms and Roni for 2$ more  each. For a sit down place like this, not a bad price. started off with a salad, hade red onion, roasted red, olives, tomatoes. Dressing was so-so, but the salad mix was good. Pizza came out, and the crust was a little burnt. but the pizza was great. they had it laid out with cheese, toppings and then sauce. so if you are a person that likes a lot of sauce, then this might not be your pizza. but as for me i like a perfect balance, then this is your pizza. cheese was awesome, toppings tasted fresh. great crunch when i bit into the pizza. 3 slices filled me up for lunch. It was very slow, during lunch, so i expected the staff would be very attentive."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place. We look forward to going. We have even taken the dog and sat outside on the patio. The Pizza has a thin crispy crust and the toppings are great. We love the Mediterranean salad and we add fresh mozzarella. It is a little pricey but it is well worth it. Hubby also loves that they have Peroni beer on tap. We have always got wonderful service."}
{"text":"Overpriced and cheep with their food.  Came in for lunch with my work crew. First time here. Interior was very nice. Lots of textures and pics of New York. Subway style signs and brick everywhere. There were 10 of us and they seated us pretty quickly and got our drinks.  Then we ordered. We were given dinner menus instead of lunch menus. You have to request the lunch menu. Found that out way after we ordered and saw a couple at another table get lunch menus. So we all paid dinner prices. Joy. For the smallest \"dinner\" size personal pizza costing $12, I hope its good.  My buddy ordered a plain cheese personal pizza. I one-upped him and ordered an extra cheese pizza. You know, the kind with a lot more cheese than the regular cheese pizza. After about an hours wait, we all got our pizzas. Absolutely NO difference in the cheese and extra cheese (other than the extra charge of $2) pizzas. We tried pointing this out the the waiter but they insisted mine had extra cheese and would not back down or go back and put extra cheese on it.   The crusts were super-thin. Almost cracker thin and hard to fold like a traditional New York stele pizza. The flavor was so-so.  So for $16 (x-tra cheese personal pizza with an iced tea) I got a small cracker with a little bit of sauce and a little bit of cheese that I had to wait for over an hour. Not cool. Major gyp. I could get something similar at Fired Pie for half the price. Or for the same price a real large pizza loaded with cheese on a real new york style crust at Buonos or Streets of New York.  So if you are one to throw good money away to be seen in a nice looking place. Go here. But if you want a good pizza at a fair price. Run away. Far away."}
{"text":"Delicious, and fast service too! I had the personal calzone with garlic and anchovies(have a meeting later, wanted to make a good impression lol) wish they put more garlic and anchovies on there though, I only had a few. The ricotta and mozerella was amazing. It was like eating a stuffed shell in a pizza!"}
{"text":"I don't get what the fuss is about here. Their pizza is very bland and ridiculously pricey!  The toppings are sparse, sauce tasteless. The crust is thin, which is fine but don't  ever take it out as trying to reheat this pizza will simply make it inedible. . . Staff is snooty. Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I hope to meet Patsy sometime! This pizza is the best...and sometimes I am hard pressed to say so since I am biased to Chicago's deep dish. Great pepperoni that is sliced nice and thick.....as a family we always enjoy the traditional pepperoni and also the calzones...nothing like that ricotta cheese!  I don't think that there is a bad choice to be made here....your tasted buds will thank you! Have enjoyed this place many times, both DC Ranch and at the Quater...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Las Vegas.   20 minute drive there from my house in Henderson, and it's still an easy choice.  Great great pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza, wish there was more cheese. Didn't realize each topping was a charge. Used to 2 or more topping there be a charge. But overall a great place to eat, nice and relaxing. to bad the landlord does not allow dogs on the patio."}
{"text":"First trip to Grimaldi's brick oven pizza. I knew it was a pizza place but other than that did not know what to expect. Just by the name I knew I would like it because I love oven baked crust. The crunch and the thinness, pure heaven. Went with 2 girlfriends from my old job. We were out celebrating our leaving the company and moving on to better things.   Now when I say I am not a pizza fan I mean I don't like pizza because of the tomato based sauce that everyone smothers on their pizzas and ruins the taste. I fell in love with pizza again when I was in Italy for 4 weeks. One of my girlfriends is a vegetarian and she had eaten there a few times so we let her pick out lunch. We ordered the large, pesto mozzarella, with ricotta cheese and pepperoni on half for us meat eaters. We also ordered the spinach salad with red onions, blue cheese crumbles, and a sweet balsamic vinaigrette. It was way more then enough food for three people with some to take home.   The waitress was very attentive. When my drink glass was half empty she would bring a new one. She was busy with other guest but still managed to make it to our table at least 4 times in our hour lunch. I think that is more than enough times to check on your guests if u see they are doing well.   I will definitely go again. Great service, great atmosphere, great company and  best of all GREAT PIZZA!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience when dining here! The entire staff from manager to hostess rock at customer service. Very attentive and helpful. Ordered the Chicken Caesar Salad (ask for the chicken to be warmed up) and a large pizza with pep and spicy chicken sausage. If you have not dined here, you are missing out :)   Also recently found out about their birthday rewards! Such a treat."}
{"text":"friendly staff, great customer service. i got their chicken calzone in large, it is huge and can definitely feed 2-3 people so tasty!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and I am quite impressed. Great service and really great pizza. We have had the \"white pizza\" , pepperoni pizza and pepperoni, sausage and jalapeños and those have all been great. Hope this place continues to deliver great food and service for us! Glad we came across it!"}
{"text":"Yum! I LOVE Grimaldi's. Whenever I want pizza, I'm always stuck in a mental debate over Grimaldis vs. Nellos, since they're across the street from one another. But when I want traditional pizza (whatever I mean by that.. I guess I mean non-funky toppings!, just typical topping like olives or garlic) I choose Grimaldis.  Love the mozzarella they put on their pizza and I love the basil and the fact that they're light on the tomato sauce. Good drink menu, too, and hostesses are always friendly!"}
{"text":"The build your own pizza with the New York style pies and toppings and the brick oven makes this pizzeria the bomb!! I also had the bruschetta trio and it was also good.  Their personal pizza is a 12\" instead of the traditional 8\" so the pizzas are large and in charge. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is on its pizza game. Being from the Northeast, the general rule is good pizza stops at the Pennsylvania border, but this place breaks the rule and changed my mind.   The restaurant is clean and charming, the staff is very friendly, polite and helpful. Management is on point and the restaurant runs like a well oiled machine dedicated to making sure you enjoy your dinner.   Thanks to the Manager, our waiter and the pizza makers for taking good care of us. We will be back whenever we are in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I had an hour to kill and thought I would grab a bite and wish I would have saved the caloric intake for something else,  the pizza was really greasy and soggy with a very plain and basic crust.  There was no flavor or tender crunch that I recognize with their style of pie, I'm hoping this was an off day as it is a new location but they need to work on it quick."}
{"text":"Conveniently located at the Venetian/Palazzo so if you're staying at either hotel, it's just a walk downstairs!   Sat down and they took away my wine glass. I guess they thought I was under 21. I guess I'll take it as a compliment? :)  HOW IT WORKS: 1. Choose a pizza size and type.  We got a large 18in. pizza with white garlic sauce: $18 2. Add desired toppings (about $2 each) We added pepperoni, sausage, and ham: $6  TOTAL COST:  $24 for a HUGE pizza which made for 8 slices and 4 happy people.   I'm not much of a pizza person, I'll eat the toppings/cheese, the crust and then throw the rest away (I know... such a waste) but I think the dough to toppings ratio is way too much for most pizzas. I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this satisfied my pizza cravings without leaving anything behind. One of the best thin crust pizzas I've ever had.  If you're dying to try the one in New York, I would say go to this one and check it out. Pretty comparable even though the one in NY is slightly better, probably because of the long line you have to wait in haha"}
{"text":"High-quality cheese. Awesome sauce, if your sauce preference is \"pure crushed San Marzano tomatoes\" (mine is). Fairly thin crust. But the crust-to-toppings ratio is way off, because the toppings are so sparse. It's like a Neapolitan pie with a tougher crust.  If we went back and ordered it with extra sauce and extra cheese, it might be pretty great--but that would add $4 to an already-somewhat-pricey pizza. Plus, I'll never manage to drag my husband back in there because he was so annoyed by the big swaths of cheeseless crust. So I'll probably never know."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza mmmmm margherita pizza is so good and white pizza with garlic is amazing too mmmm!!  Def rec this place and will keep coming back for more!  Service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"just went again tonight by my sons recommendation for his b-day and yup this is the best pizza. my son got regular cheese pizza with cooked pepperonis on the side, they cook the pepperonis and put them in a dish, they are awesome like this, like little bacon pieces.try it. the girl and i had half white and half red sauce with peperoni and sun dried tomato, yumm! the only complaint i have was we ordered and Caesar salad and had four adults, the server said a large would feed 4, but it really wasn't enough for 4. although i like salad so it might have been enough for others. i still say this is one of the best pizza joints in town even if a little spendy."}
{"text":"Its a nice place i love the door service it caught me offguard. Pizza was okay and overall i would come back again.."}
{"text":"Delish thin crust pizza made right in front of you. Service was great. Restaurant has a relaxing atmosphere. Great for dates or family visits."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to go get pizza! :) I'm usually not big on having pizza all the time, but for some reason, after coming to this place, it practically became a place for indulgence for our family. Many other reviewers have probably already mentioned, but THIS is where you can get authentic New York style pizza, and I won't lie to you on that one.  If it's your first time, though, then there are two things:  First, I don't recommend getting more than you need and/or getting it to-go unless you're going to eat it within the next ten minutes. Although very delicious, the thin crusted pizza they make can become more crunchy than needed and they don't honestly make great leftovers. So, eat only enough, and eat what you can, and fast; this pizza is not very fantastic once it's not warm anymore, and reheating it can sometimes make it taste worse. I mean, it's really up to you, but our family agreed upon this.  Second, I also don't recommend getting more than three or four toppings on a single pizza, especially if it's not going to be a large that you're ordering. I'm a bit picky on sauce, as I like a good, helpful amount. Unless you ask for extra, it may be a bit too dry for your taste if you're like me. And also, because it's a pretty thin pizza, too many toppings can probably result in a soggy, heavy pizza that you'll have to bring to your plate. But again, just a matter of opinion.  Whenever we come here, we usually get a large pizza with mushrooms, onions, and most importantly, Ricotta cheese. Occasionally, we consider on sausage, but usually we only go with three toppings unless we're feeling generous on a serving of meat. I really recommend getting some Ricotta cheese on pizza here; it's absolutely delicious, and makes for a great, creamy taste. We love onions because it adds a little more flavor. The sausage is, again, for when we feel we want more meat. But mushrooms are mostly just there, though I do enjoy the simple taste of some mushroom slices on a pizza.  All in all, it's great to come here to experiment. We like to stick to the same thing because we enjoy what they give us, and we seem to have the combination of toppings that we know we like.  Oh! Also, don't eat too much, especially if you want to save some room for dessert! Their cheesecakes are fantastic, and there are at least two seasonal types that you don't want to miss once they're gone until the next year!  Grimaldi's is fantastic! :) Eat with a group, or eat by yourself; it's great either way!"}
{"text":"We got the white pizza with garlic, pepperoni and jalapeño....oh my...it was so yummy!!! We have to say so far the best pizza place in Vegas!!!   Will be bringing family and friends here to enjoy this delicious pizza!! Make sure when you order the Jalapeños is a bit too spicy so get loads of water    Enjoy all the yumminess!!!"}
{"text":"In from LA best Pizza ever. Loved it. Thin crust was great. great service."}
{"text":"We had another relaxing and delicious dining experience at Grimaldi's tonight.  After a  grueling day of class it was so nice to enjoy a crisp house salad topped with lots of yummy goodies followed by a Margherita pizza with added pepperoni Curt was a terrific waiter. Thank you."}
{"text":"Strike 4 out of 4 1st visit (Scottsdale location 2012): Went for my bachelorette party with a group of 10. They served everyone else's dinner at the same time except my own. Not sure if they forgot my order but waited 10 min after everyone had already been eating for mine.  2nd visit: (Scottsdale location 2013): went with a large group of about 18-20 for a friends birthday. Almost unbelievable, but everyone was served except me and my husband since we were sharing. Waiter didn't even notice, when he came back to check on everyone he didn't even know I hadn't been served. He quickly put in our order. Once again everyone was finished with dinner by the time mine came out and it was burnt (very bad) He said he would remake it but I denied because everyone was already done eating. So we had burnt pizza while everyone watched. Pretty embarrassing.  3nd visit (Scottsdale location 2014): went with a group of 6. Once again everyone was served except me. I really thought it was a joke this time. Waiter came back and said they burnt my pizza. Everyone was done eating before my dinner even came out.  4th visit (Glendale location 2016): made reservations because we had a concert to catch, waited 20 minutes OVER our reservation time before I asked the hostess how much longer and she said we were 8th in line! Explained we had reservations for this time and have a concert to go to. She said there's nothing she can do. So I asked if we could just order because it takes at least 30 min to actually make the pizza and maybe by then we will have a table or we can just sit at the bar. She basically said that isn't allowed so you're SOL. So I said ok, we don't have the time to go anywhere else, we would have if you had informed us you were running behind but you didn't. So can I please just order to go and I will leave. She finally said ok. Luckily the very sweet manager came out and said he will seat us shortly and get our order in right away. Once we were seated we only ordered one pizza to share and low and behold they got the one and only order we made wrong. They put in the wrong toppings. Oh well, still tasted good.   After 4 strikes I don't think I'll be coming back here unfortunately, because their pizzas really are good."}
{"text":"Pretty great pizzas! A bit pricy but you are paying for quality here not quantity. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"Shout out to Mikaela!  Great service and the pesto pizza with chicken and artichokes was awesome! Thank you Mikaela for making sure we weren't late for the movie!"}
{"text":"We make this a must visit every time we come to Vegas.  I was worried when I first heard that Grimaldi's had gone chain, but they are doing it right. This pizza tastes just like the original. My choice:  sausage and ricotta. Resist the urge to add too many toppings."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had... and all because of the pepperonis!!!  We ordered a couple of different pizzas and a caesar salad.  I'm not too huge of a pepperoni fan, but I must say the pepperoni was AMAZING.  The server said its aged for 1 year.  They are little pepperonis and full of incredible flavor.  Also tried the cheese pesto pizza which was pretty good.  Service was great, the server was friendly and had lots of suggestions.  Will definetely be going back during our next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This pizza is stellar. As a Chicagoan I always thought thin crust pizza was inferior to deep dish until I ate here."}
{"text":"You can always count on an excellent trip when you visit Grimaldi's. I have never had a bad experience in any way in any of the times I've eaten at this location or any other one for that matter. Grimaldi's gives a consistently professional experience and always has scrumptious food.  Today was no different. My husband and I we were in for lunch so we started with a small Mediterranean salad to share (that we could have split to with more people as well) and a half carafe of the house wine.   We ordered a pesto pizza with beef meatballs, jalapenos and mushrooms. The thin crust is delicious the pesto is to die for. It is one of my favorite pizzas in the valley.   We ended the meal with a slice of Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake and a glass of Moscato. The service was spot on and the entire experience was enjoyable. I highlt recommend Grimaldi's to everyone!"}
{"text":"This pizza was awesome! We were quickly seated when we arrived and the server brought out pizza dough for the kids to play with while we looked over the menu. My boys LOVED that. We ended up ordering The Don which had pepperoni, sausage and meatballs. The meatballs were delicious. It's fun that the kitchen is right in the middle of the dining room so you can watch them make the pizza and put it in the coal oven. We went back later and order a cannoli which was heavenly. We'll definitely be back on our next trip!"}
{"text":"The white pizza with thin crispy crust is just delicious as was the salad (big enough for two to share.)   Our server was so friendly and even the manager came over to chat with us and ensure everything was to our liking.  We sat outside and enjoyed the warm beautiful evening.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for great pizza and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I never have the time to wait in line for their pizza in NY, so we were really excited to stumble this location.  The entire G5 (our little family of 5) enjoyed every bite.    We we got to our table and they gave our three boys some pizza to play with while we waited for our food.  They all had a blast trying to make the dough into the perfect round pizza shape.  There was a grumpy old codger at the table next to us, he complained to the server right from the start... \"We've never been here before, and with these prices I'm sure we won't be back...\" I could see that all the tables around them were watching his every complaint and everyone was impressed with how the sever attempted to handle him.  After he left all four surrounding tables talked to her about her wonderful customer. She handled her self very well and was very sweat and professional in the face of someone who was never going to be satisfied.   We couldn't decide on traditional, or the pesto, pizza base so we went for one of each.  We added different topping to each side and made some pretty amazing, yet pricey, combinations.  It ended up being pricy, but totally worth it.   The bottom line... great atmosphere, great food and very friendly service!  Based on our experience at this location, we will definitely make time to check out the original location on our next trip to New York!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in LV on my honeymoon from SoCal and I remembered hearing about a awesome pizza place near Henderson 10 from the strip.   We ordered the white garlic pizza w/ pepperoni and mushroom.   This was hands down the BEST pizza I have ever had in my 32 yrs on this earth. Yelpers please try this place and get what I ordered because it rocked my tastebuds.   Pizza 5 stars Ceasar salad 5 stars Cheese cake 5 stars Service 5 stars  Grimaldi's deserves 20 stars."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in the valley. Scottsdale Quarter, Old Town, and Glendale are best dine-in locations. Skip DC ranch except for takeout. Pizza is always perfect, not to much sauce and cheese, right amount of toppings. Nice beer and wine selections. Service is always friendly and welcoming. Save room for their cannoli, it's amazing."}
{"text":"If you're searching for THE best coal-fired brick oven, New York-style thin crust pizza in the world, look no further. Grimaldi's offers over 100 years of pizza-making traditions and the tantalizing aroma of pizza and calzones baked to perfection in the signature coal burning oven. Why coal-fired ovens? It gives our pizza and calzones a unique flavor and a crisp crust that is just not possible from gas, convection or wood burning ovens."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  Loved the pepperoni & sausage pizza, house salad!  The best thing they have there is the cannoli for dessert.  It was the perfect meal, service was great as well.  Great place for dinner, always look forward to going there!"}
{"text":"It had been a long time since I've visited this chain.  I guess it was time to come back for a refresher.    Located off of Eastern, you can't miss their signage.  This already busy area doesn't have a lot of parking to accommodate what could be.  It's very hectic in and out so be ready for that.    Walking up to the door, the welcoming hostess opened the door and escorted us in.  The staff here were all very polite and courteous.  Our server Alex was amazing.  He was attentive with a fun personality.    I decide to try their Caesar Salad and Calzone.  The salad was tasty and large for a small salad.  I loved the fresh shaved parmesan and cracked pepper. Delicious.    I opted to stuff the calzone with spinach and mushrooms.  They really did a great job using fresh and plenty of ingredients inside.  Ricotta is one of their normal ingredients used inside so you don't have to order it extra.  Nice! Their dipping sauce on the side gave it a great flavor that I'm sure I'll be back for.    I certainly enjoyed a lovely dining experience here.  I hope it won't be long before my next visit."}
{"text":"I have been going to Grimaldi's since I discovered it in Scottdale, AZ over 7 years ago. I was quite excited once they came to Vegas. They definitely can make a pizza. I love the thin crust, the mozzarella is always fresh, and the small pepperoni are my favorite. The coal brick oven gives the pizza a unique, toasty flavor...yum! Their salads are pretty good too, a small order works well for 2 people. Pizza is definitely on the pricier side, especially with extra toppings but the taste is worth it. The pizza alone would give this place 5 stars, but I had to give 3 just because of service. Service is the other half of the dining out experience. Each time I have come here I have not received anything over mediocre service. I have never been here when each table was full, or even close to it. The server is always slow in greeting us when we sit. And I have never had my water refilled without asking. In all fairness, the other Grimaldi's locations in the valley that I have been to have all had the same problems with service. It's a real shame because their food is so good, but they need to work on properly training their staff on customer service."}
{"text":"I finally decided to visit Grimaldi's this month, based on all the great reviews. Pizza was cooked perfectly!!! The crust was thin and crispy, like a cracker (my favorite). Service was great as well. Great place to hang out with your friends or for a night out with your family."}
{"text":"On my fourth visit to Grimaldi's something amazing happened. I decided to try the pesto pizza, took one bite and POW! I was blown away! This pizza place was already out of this world awesome in my mind but after tasting their pesto pizza, Grimaldi's officially won a pizza my heart.  Grimaldi's is a genuine, high-quality pizza joint that oozes class. By no means is it an over the top cheese ball pizza parlor packed to the brim like Oreganos. Instead, this place is so basic that it's luxurious. At Grimaldi's, less is more. It is quite simple really, as their menu doesn't have much on it except for pizza, salad and wine. However, I've come to find that basic/limited menus are always a good sign because that means a restaurant can specialize and perfect a specific item, and in Grimaldi's case, that item is authentic NY style pizza.  Inside, it can get very loud and very busy. On the weekends, waiting for a table can take forever but the wait is 100% worth every second. And even though this place gets packed to the brim, once you grab a table it doesn't feel packed. There is enough spacing in between tables to where you don't feel squished. The red brick interior and awesome framed photos that adorn the walls really bring this place to life.  The pizzas here don't come cheap but I'm telling you they are undoubtedly worth the higher price tag and the longer wait. With the freshest toppings and endless make your own pizza combinations, you really can't go wrong with the menu at Grimaldi's. Their crust is also to die for, and that's probably because of their amazing pizza oven and pizza chefs!  Every single time I've been here, the service has been spectacular. Yes, it has taken longer than I would have liked for a pizza to arrive at my table but the wonderful thing about the servers at Grimaldi's is that they don't ignore you or try to avoid you if your waiting a long time to receive your food (due to the fact that they are packed). Instead, they update you on your order and acknowledge the fact that the kitchen is running behind. Their customer service skills make all the difference.  Recently, Matt's company decided to throw their Christmas party in one of their event rooms, and the wait staff did an outstanding job. They were friendly, accommodating and at the end they even packaged all the extras for people to take home because there was sooooooo much food! I also have to note that they have multiple rooms for larger parties, and the cost to hold an event in one of their rooms (complete with catering and an open full bar, whoo hoo!) is EXTREMELY affordable and a total steal for what you get. I highly recommend hosting an event at Grimaldi's!  Overall, I love that Grimaldi's brings a little taste of authentic New York to Scottsdale with their superior service and exceptionally tasty food."}
{"text":"Three stars for great decor, friendly service, and a decent wine list.  Two stars for bland pizza and too much sugar in the sauce.  Our waiter said that Grimaldi's opened in Arizona because \"...there was no good pizza in Arizona.\"  If it wasn't for Rosatti's and Oregano's, that would still be the case."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good service. A little pricey for pizza. Not much choice of apps. Not the greatest pizza , but ok for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We love Grimaldi's, it wasnt a busy night and was told it would be a 20 min wait, it was maybe 15 mins, the service was PRIMO and the food was excellent as usual!!!"}
{"text":"My gf and I stopped at Grimaldi's on our way to Los Angeles and it was just as delicious as the Brooklyn location, which I thought was excellent! I would recommend Grimaldi's to anyone who enjoys quality pizza. We ordered a white with garlic medium with pepperoni, artichoke, olives, and Italian sausage. We also got a small Caesar which was average. We were not at all disappointed with our visit to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"The hostess halfway greeted us. When we said we were going to sit at the bar she just ok and looked away. My husband and I sat at the bar for 8 mins or so and not a single person talked to us or helped us even thought they were slow with only 2 other tables. A server even came up to the bar, got a glass of water fee her table, ignored us, then after giving her table the water start d folding napkin. They obviously didn't want our business so we left and went to Kona grill and spent $100 there instead."}
{"text":"This location feels more family friendly than the Scottsdale Quarter location. Pizza is really good. I usually order the large which is thin and crispy, lots of bubbles which are popular at our table. I had the medium pie once and it seemed like they use the same doughball but just spin it smaller as the crust was thicker and more chewy. Could have been an off night but that was what it seemed like. Salads are good, including the kale one. I'm not a big fan of the colon blow known as kale but this one was good.  Togo orders seem to take forever. They tell you up front it's going to be a long wait and if you get there and your pie isn't ready there isn't a real good place to wait.  Oh, if you have little sh!ts in your group ask for some dough for them to play with while waiting"}
{"text":"Love this pizza! It's thin crust, coal oven baked and amazing. The coal oven gives it a blistered crust, with a large selection of toppings. It uses a crushed tomato sauce, light and flavorable. Their house salad, with house oil and vinegar dressing is fresh, generous and delicious.  We have been coming to this central Scottsdale location since it opened many years ago, and, have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza that wont break the bank 4 of us ate w/wine for $105.00 Karen was our server and she was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"First off....NYC pizza is not doughy. Real coal-oven pizza like Lombardi's and Grimaldi's (the two originals from NY) are thin crust, mozzarella, basil, and simple sauce.....delicious. Don't get me wrong, if you love Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, deep-dish pizzas then you probably won't be crazy about Grimaldi's. If you like thin-crust, traditional Italian style pizzas that are simple and delicious (more about the mix of flavors and textures) then Grimaldi's is your place. I've had both Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and Lombardi's.....I prefer Grimaldi's. The Grimaldi's in Scottsdale is pretty close to the original in Brooklyn, although not quite as good....hence the 4 stars. Keep an open mind, expect good, traditional, thin-crust, simple, Italian pizza and you'll be all good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  I'm Italian. I'm a pizza freak. And I am very opinionated when it comes to my pizza. I generally like most pizza places, because I just love pizza.  I went here with 3 other people and was excited. They had the outside bar open (why the hell you would want to sit outside in 100+ degrees, I don't know). The waiter was hilarious, and very lucky that I love all kinds of humor and sarcasm. Most people would've found him to be offensive.  I loved the fact that they cook the pizzas in a traditional brick oven and hand toss their pizza dough.  The bread with olive oil/pepper/balsamic vinegar was rather horrible. I attribute it to the crappy olive oil and subpar bread (I hate to say it, but Macaroni Grill has the best). Something as simple as that turns me off. We ordered two pizzas, each half and half. I had pepperoni, garlic, basil on the side, and fresh tomatoes. The basil was not fresh, it was brown and bitter.  Something very important to know about their pizza is that their \"pizza sauce\" has NO SPICES whatsoever. It's plain ol' tomato. That's why it's important to get the extra toppings. That's how they make their money. Each topping is $2+. I'm sorry, but I love my spices.  Hop on the 215 and get over to Joe's NY pizza by the Outlet Mall. THAT is pizza."}
{"text":"Recently it's been a hit or miss. I came a few weeks ago and the pizza was crispy and delicious. But recently when I came late night with a few friends it was soggy and cold. I was surprised because usually it is made much better."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and after each time I told my self I'm not coming back, burnt,  dry, terrible tasting, blah!"}
{"text":"I ate here the other day while passing through town. I have eaten at other Grimaldi's including the original in NY. This might be the best Pizza West of NY! I grew up in Boston and lived in NY. I know the difference between \"great\" and \"good\" pizza. If \"Great\" is what you seek, this is the place. In addition to the awesome pie, the service is very good. Super nice people. Wish they would open one up in SoCal!"}
{"text":"I couldn't have asked for a better post-shopping meal.   Started off with a fresh Capresse salad which is left to be dressed by the customer to prevent any over use of balsamic or olive oil. Then proceeded to wolf down a delicious pizza with ricotta, red peppers, and meatballs. I really lack the adjective to describe how each flavor lead you into the next. Their brick oven makes a delightful difference.   The bartender recommended a fantastic pre-prohibition lager by Coors which made the whole experience perfect."}
{"text":"Experience:::: on Friday Night, Atmosphere :  outside, nice patio overlooking grassy area, with band for some  fun entertainment    Waitress: 1st Impression : Zombie like, but does  manage at tip time to muster  a matel  like farewell, but we did get refills on our drinks promptly.   Food : we ordered a forgettable  caesar salad, the dressing was more oily than creamy. MEH, MEH,  Pizza : sausage, onion, garlic were the topping of choice.  The flavor was good but the infrastructure of  pizza  was poor. Full on soggy, drowned core!    What happened to Crispy crust?   Well I guess nothing if I  was only counting the circumference of the pie.   This place was going to get a  2 star, but I upped it to 3 because the manager came over later very gregarious & warm and asked how everything was? So rare now a days. We didn't complain but figured we might have experienced on off pie, anyway the ingredients were fresh & good quality.   Hubs & I are partial to  pizza we've  had in St. Louis, so far  the best ever by far."}
{"text":"We waited so long for this place...probably almost an hour of wait on a Friday night...  I never been to Grimaldi's before so def intrigued in trying...it seemed like everyone and their mom was there...so many people...and celebrations so the atmosphere was alive :)  We got two large pizzas for 4 people...margherita and the meat one idk what it's called lol...  The cheese on these pizza was really good (yumm!)...but honestly I still like Fired pie better...hmm  Their dessert is pretty good tho...had the trio sampler (canoli, cheesecake and tiramisu yummm)  I would definitely come back for the the food, atmosphere, and great service!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Great food. Wonderful atmosphere. It's as simple as that. I like that you could get your pizza however you like, I prefer this way of ordering to the specials. For dessert you can't go wrong with a cheesecake (homemade style) but my favorite is their tiramisu! For starters, I would go with a small salad (house is my favorite) which is more than enough for 2 people or you can go with their bruschetta (the classic tomato mozzarella is delicious)."}
{"text":"Excellent service,  super clean polite over the phone more so in person. All this and they gave me FREE large pizza for my birthday."}
{"text":"Service and food are awesome! Try the Don pizza and add ricotta cheese it comes put great. Expect a waiting time or line especially weekends and happy hours but you can always make a reservations. This place is great with kids or family dine out."}
{"text":"Oh man, it's delicious! Just get a pizza, easy as that. I tried the calzone too, but it was just okay.   Restaurant vibes are cool! I love the big windows that bring natural light into the restaurant. It almost makes you feel as if you were eating outside but your in a an ACd, comfortable, open space. Important on those days when it's 110 degrees outside.  If you're staying at the Venetian or the Palazzo, ask for a coupon book--there's one in there for Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  From the Bruschetta, to the Pizza to the wonderful wait staff, Grimaldi's was fantastic. Oh, and I must not forget the made on site Cheesecake.    We wanted Pizza and love thin crust brick oven pizza.  Grimaldi's had great reviews so we decided to give it a try. The Bruschetta is three pieces, all split in two, with a variety of styles. The pizza is mostly create your own but they do have a few traditional favorites if you choose that route. The wait staff was energetic and fantastic.   We finished with some cheesecake that the wife and I fought over the last bite.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Well if you are looking for a long review talking about everything else that does not matter read on.  I will only talk about the one thing that takes us to the places we love to eat.  That is the food.    I will reminisce a bit.  When I was a kid we lived away from everything.   The only pizza I had was pizza my mother made.  Most of it was by scratch too.  The only thing she purchased was the sauce and peperoni.  That was some of the best pizza too.  I did not have commercialized pizza until I was almost 12 years old.  Then there was only one pizza place that delivered there too.  Arizona seems to have had a bloom of pizza.  There are some very good pizza places here.  (I am covering all the bases too.  Because there are different types of pizza)   I am glad to say this place is one of my favourite places to eat pizza.  We have come here a few times and it has been solid.  We stopped by here after watching a Wind River at the Harkins.  Good movie BTW.  This time we got a salad which was great.  The pizza was half peperoni and sausage.  The other half was cheese.  The pizza was super good.  Not much more is needed to say about it.  I am sure if I did some research this place probably has roots in New York or some where in that area of the USA.    People give this place a try.  I am sure you will like it.  Just remember there are different styles of pizza for the different types of people.  This place is a oven style with a thin crust.  It will be different than a Chicago deep dish.  Give it a try and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about this place. It was mediocre pizza. I like the place but not sure I would go back there for pizza. I thought Oreganos was a much tastier pie and even better setting. I was a bit shocked they didn't have BBQ chicken pizza on their menu, just very standard toppings on a thin crust that could have been tastier. The place wasn't nearly full yet there was quite a wait for a seat."}
{"text":"Checked this place out the other day. Was told about it by my buddy who is Italian. Couldn't believe how good it was. Had the clam pizza. Make sure if you get it you get the thick crust. The lemon juice real compliments it as well.   Also had this olive appetizer which was great also. Will have to keep this one in my treasure box. Yelpers you shouldn't be disappointed. Love it"}
{"text":"Something that I always look for when eating at a restaurant is great food and awesome service and this place definitely delivered both. The food was finger licking good and our severs were an awesome duo. Our female server knew a lot about the menu and was really nice. Our male server was super cool and gave my boyfriend and I multiple good laughs. They definitely know how to make you feel like family.   *Hint: pretty sure they were both from the east coast."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's in Vegas is like everything else in Vegas... a pretty decent copy, but you can't help but know it's a copy.  it's the best pizza i've had in Vegas to date, but that is not saying much, and it's a far cry from the real grimaldi's in brooklyn. the crust doesn't quite taste the same as the one in NYC, and also does not have quite the same combination of crisp and chew that I would expect. I asked them if it was the water, but they claim they have a mineralologist (sp?) that matches their water to exactly the same as NYC tap. i don't quite believe it."}
{"text":"We had a buffet style lunch for a new job orientation. The pizza was lovely the crust was crunchy and I loved the basil flavor in the cheese. The pepperoni was full of flavor and not too greasy. The salad was fresh but kind plain. I would come back here if not for the pizza for the great server she was friendly and accommodating. ~~ try the pain fruit trees~~"}
{"text":"I am not a pizza lover, but I actually like the pizza here. The reason why they are not getting 5 stars though is because and the hostesses and waitresses were really rude."}
{"text":"So I'm writing this review while my pizza is warming up in the oven. The reason for two stars you might ask, we ordered a large and a medium pizza accompanied by a salad to go. The price was $60 which was fine, but what really grinds my gears is when they take down my number and tell me it's going to be an hour wait. I get there 8 minutes early and the pizzas are ready. I live 3 minutes away and the time from me leaving the door to entering my house the pizza is cold. Not because I took the long way home or because the ac was blasting, but because they made the pizza earlier and didn't bother to call. They let our pizza sit in the heat box, which must have been broken. Moral of the story is, great pizza if you go in and eat, but don't take out!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Margarita pizza and absolutely loved it! It's been almost 5 days since we had it and it's still all we can talk about. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I were in town this weekend to visit with friends. We had limited time and needed to have our favorite pizza. Since moving to Seattle/Tacoma area, we have not had anything near as good as Grimaldi's. We decided we would post on Facebook to let our friends know where we'd be if they wanted to meet up with us. When the head count reached 12 we thought we better make reservations. Before lunch was over, we had a party of 26!!! The staff at Grimaldi's was so accommodating of our rather large and unexpected group. And, as always, the pizza was the best. Thank you so much for making our reunion lunch so wonderful. I only wish we had ordered a pizza to go to bring back to the Pacific Northwest, I'm hungry for more."}
{"text":"This is real NYC style pizza. The only reason I dont give it 5 stars is the prices. It is spendy for pizza. I will go back if I have the chance... or a coupon."}
{"text":"Colleagues and I frequent this place on a regular basis. The enclosed patio fits big groups while serving up great salads and coal fired pie. I can't get enough of the ricotta, spicy sausage, and jalapeño thin crust pizza. Plus the patio has a desert view to boot."}
{"text":"Amazing! Seriously the best pizza ever. I have had Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and the one in Vegas is just as good, maybe even better.  The service is absolutely amazing! Though the wait is long, they treat everyone so nice and it makes it all worth it. We ordered two large, one pepperoni & mushroom and the other Margherita style. Both were delicious. We also ordered a large cesar, big enough for all 5 of us to get a good amount. My hubby ordered a canoli which he loved and my brother and I shared the NY style cheesecake.   Everything was great, all of that food plus a few beers, soft drinks, and a good tip $80.   There were 5 of us total. We finished all the pizza, cause we just couldn't stop eating it ha!"}
{"text":"Being from New York are usually do not get pizza outside of the state. While in Vegas there's only two pizza places that I will eat at the first is secret pizza in the seconds is Grimaldi.   Grimaldi's is located in the Palazzo it can be a little tricky to get here it is at the end of the hotel and if anybody has been to the Venetian or the Palazzo they know that you need a map to navigate the entire property it's huge.   Me and my three friends we came here for dinner before we went out to hit the club. We called ahead of time to make reservations the girl at the reservation counter said that we didn't need reservations but I'm a Steffler want to comes to that stuff and I insisted that we had reservations. When we arrived I told the host that we had reservations for four and my last name and she seem to have no idea what I was talking about. But she said us promptly.   Our waiter was absolutely incredible he knew the entire menu by memory he had great recommendations and selections for us he also came back to fill our drinks up and water consistently I wish I could remember his name but he was fantastic.   Being from New York I am really really picky when it comes to Pizza. The atmosphere reminded me of home there was all these old New York signs on the wall and photos really cool. They did a good job replicating the store is close to the one in New Jersey. There's a huge fire oven in the middle of the location. The smell inside here is incredible.  So with Grimaldi's what we're talking about is a really thin crust pizza super crispy a sweeter tomato sauce and you get that wood coal-fired flavor with a little burn on the edge of a crossed in my opinion that makes the pizza that's the flavor is that Burnt crust  My buddy is from New Jersey and he wanted to get the white garlic pie. We started with the white garlic pie and then we also ordered a meat lovers pizza which had sausage pepperoni ham and bacon. The pizza was absolutely incredible. After eating both of the pizzas we decided to order a small calzone which a small calzone is probably the size of a large add any kind of pizzeria it's enough to feed four people. We just got a Ricota and ham . The calzone was excellent.   The nice thing about them all these is that the prices are insane. You can have a good taste for a meal that simple and does not break the bank for four people and that's what I think is special.   If anyone is from the East Coast and you're looking for a good solid pizza place from all these is definitely a top choice is it the same as the location in New Jersey no but they do their best interpretation to replicate it and you know what being 2000 miles away they do a pretty good job at it. I would recommend anybody to come here and eat I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the thin crispy crust. Came here for my birthday after getting a coupon for a free large! My family loves Grimaldi's and will be back for my son's birthday next week!"}
{"text":"Waited 50 min for a table for two. Counted 6 empty tables for two Counted 13 other tables Got seated at a table for four....  they have an app to tell you your wait in line .... We ordered and ate one large soggy pizza When we left ... we were still sixth in line for seating...  watched a fella rolling silverware... wipe his nose on his sleeve 6 or 7 times  I believe it's time to find a new pizza place"}
{"text":"I had the pressure of dining at Grimaldis a few weeks ago because I have heard so much about this pizza joint from the food network channel.What a disappointment !! We were seated next to a couple that had very young children, don't get me wrong I have 5, and the kids were entertained with pizza dough that was given to them by staff. The kids had a ball, I did not.  When I order wine by the glass I like to see the bottle it is being poured from because I don't always trust the bar help and I like to know that I'm drinking what I paid for. Too lazy to open another bottle? The pizza was bland and the toppings were skimpy.  I paid my bill and left Grimaldis feeling like I was RAKED over the coals"}
{"text":"By my assessment, they're overrated. Ordered the white pizza with garlic and it was like eating salted cardboard. On another trip we ordered the traditional pizza and it had no flavor. There's nothing special about the crust and the sauce has no flavor. I don't get the appeal, but given that a 16\" pizza with two toppings comes to $25, I won't bother trying to figure it out."}
{"text":"Authentic New York style old world pizza - thin crust, light sauce & cooked to perfection. Open until midnight we went 4 late night snack. Been in Vegas many times but never tried pizza this is our new spot Great find!!!"}
{"text":"Very unique pizza. Unique, as in good. The coal fire  makes a very crisp crust with lots of flavor. The sauce is great and the toppings are generous. If you like a thin crust pizza, you have to try this place. If you like a thick crust pizza, go call Domino's."}
{"text":"My sister and I go here all the time when she comes to town. She downer like sweet things so we get share a white pesto pizza each time. We will come and get a table where we can watch the chefs make the pizza, it's entertaining.  Theirs is some of the best I have ever had. When I want good pizza I come to Grimaldi's"}
{"text":"The calzones are really good here. They are very large and filling. I ordered the cannoli's and they have a good taste to them but unfortunately they didn't fill the whole thing with the filling. Haha I bit into it and it was a hollow shell. But the little bit i did get to taste was good."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Grimaldi's in a couple years. I received a e-mail saying that I could get a free pizza up to $18 for free to celebrate my birthday. That's pretty generous! This locations is near Cheesecake Factory and other hot spots so the parking lot is often full but I got lucky this last time and grabbed a close spot as someone was pulling out. Walking in we were greeted and the inside was packed. We had to wait just a short couple of minutes before being seated. To get things started I ordered the Antipasto which I have have each visit and liked it just as much this time too, It's simple yet tasty. I picked a pizza with pepperoni and sausage and let me tell you this pizza was bomb! I don't like it when a pizza has too much sauce and this pizza was just right. The toppings had great flavor and it was just a good and satisfying meal. Our server was cool and he checked on us often and took great care of us. I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"I love the fast brick oven they use. And the great service. Its really close to where i work also. And i like the scenery there. They have tvs and a bar. So its good for all ages. I like coming on my break and getting a pizza and taking it home."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, similar to the other Grimaldi's we've visited.  Service was decent.  Nice atmosphere.  I came here for lunch with the kiddos and we were seated in a long room, very private to other parts of the dining area.  You'd think, GREAT!  ... but next to us sharing this wonderful enclosed private area was a big party.  The group was celebrating someone's birthday and they were THE LOUDEST GROUP OF PEOPLE we have ever sat next to.  It was so awful I was literally getting a headache.  They were celebrating someone's birthday so it's not like I can do anything (nor should I because why ruin someone's celebration?)  I guess the upside is for once my kiddos were well behaved ... but I still suffered the wrath of loud patrons.  Haha."}
{"text":"We went here for my daughter's 5th birthday and had the whole family with us (all 13). Pizza is better than in Brooklyn! Comes out fresh every time and they know how to handle large groups very well! I hope these guys open a few out to California soon!! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Grimaldis is a good pizza restaurant originally from New York they have wood fired pizzas that are amazing, I get the meatball and pepperoni - with the little pepperonis that are stupid good. They have an outdoor seating area that is to hot during the summer and to windy during the winter, so I never sit there. The bartenders are good and the beer from tap is very tasty. Calling ahead is a good bet since they can get busy.They are tucked away in the corner so you may not see them driving down eastern."}
{"text":"First time here. Pizza is awesome. Thin crust is crunchy and holds up to the sauce and toppings."}
{"text":"Well for all the hype and advertising, what a major disappointment! Yes the crust is thin, but not tasty.  We ordered the mushroom and they scattered the pie with some shaved very thin.  They use about a tablespoon of tomato sauce and about the same amount of a tasteless cheese.   Dominos has better pizza.  And it's expensive.  I'm from Los Angeles and every place here is better."}
{"text":"New York thin crust extra sauce with meatball and pepperoni; combine it with white sangria and end the meal with a chocolate chip cannoli...I'm in heaven! Service is grrrrrreat!  Food is superb.  Ambience is crafty and a bit pub rustic.  The jazzy music is speaking to my soul and my belly. I'm not in love but I'm singing come and get your love! Wrap it up... The bill for all this magnificence was only $40 bucks...not too shabby.. I shall return.."}
{"text":"We love their peperoni pizza! We're always ordering pizza here because they are so delish! We tried dining in once and our experience was great. Very nice people, great service, great food. We love it!"}
{"text":"We always order to-go but the restaurant itself is nice. Food tip: Order a pizza with pepperoni, basil, and ricotta. Seriously amazing!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! Came on a weekday and used my free birthday pizza coupon. Our waitress was really friendly and the service was quick. I recommend the blueberry cobbler cheesecake it is so good!"}
{"text":"Wanted pizza,  had free pizza for my birthday from grimaldis , it was so good  We had the Don. It was fabulous. Our server was good too,  Ryan he did a good job.  But the blond at the bar was not very helpful,  we wanted the happy hour price and she just kept walking by.  We asked twice,  she said the  bartender had to take care of us, finally the third time she helped us. But it was like pulling teeth to get a beer. But the food made up for it.  But I still would have liked another beer,  should have ordered 2."}
{"text":"Pricey, highly forgettable pizza. There was nothing unique or special about this pizza -- not its bland sauce, dry, thin crust, tasteless toppings or its overall taste. Our bartender/server was very personable and nice. Thank god there was beer. We had a large with pepperoni and mushrooms. $35 for a pizza and two beers....I'd rather grate off my nipples with a cheese grater than rush back here any time soon. I do not get the hype surrounding this place."}
{"text":"I was one of the unfortunate few to have a bad experience at this place.. We order our pizza and for some reason pizza was extra soggy. There was water under the pizza.. So I told the manager and he offer to make a second pizza.. The second pizza was better not great just a bit better.. Garlic was raw on this pizza.. After being done with dinner, our server took about 10 minutes to bring my check after I requested it, also when she brought it back it was wrong I was being charged double. Overall it was a very unpleasant experience. I will give this place a second chance.. One day."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, great service, and good times.  I went to a holiday party here and the venue was wonderful, plus on your birthdays they give you a very nice present.  Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I remember when this first opened, back in the late 90's or early 2000's, it was a big deal because it was the first location of this restaurant outside of New York. Now, I look at the menu and Grimaldi's appears to be in 14 or 15 states. Unfortunately, it seems like the quality has gone downhill as the chain expanded. Maybe it's just because there are now so many other good pizza options in the Valley but on my most recent visit I was not impressed. The pizza was average at best and definitely overpriced. Plus I feel like the menu used to have more options. I really can't recommend this place anymore when there are so many better places to go."}
{"text":"I have to say that this location was far better in food and service than their DC Ranch location.  Which is too bad, as I live around the corner from that place.  I was very happy with the food this time, much better pizza and salad.  The service was polite and attentive.  We even sat outside on a hot day, and with the shade and misters, it was comfortable."}
{"text":"Pricey, but good.  I would have wanted the service to be a bit more attentive. The small pizza would be a large in other places.  You won't find too many veggies to add to your pizza at this place, you better be a carnivore.  It had been since May 2010 since we were here last, and probably won't be in our normal rotation as it was $60 for dinner, with no alcohol.   It was good, but too pricey."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and this is solid pizza.  Sauce has a great flavor and the crust is awesome.  Not very cheap, but very a good pie.  Service is always spot on, friendly, attentive, but not overly-so."}
{"text":"This is probably the best gluten free pizza I've had.. Tastes just like \"normal\" pizza!  If you join their birthday email list you get a free pizza up to $20.00 which rocks!  Everything is great about this place except the cost... Average $22.00 for a large pizza or a 12\"gluten free pizza.  Pretty spendy for pizza! Other than that, service was great and so is the pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times for lunch and dinner in addition to the original in Brooklyn. My expectations of a restaurant start with how long it takes to get seated, how long it takes before we are greeted by our waitress, how long it takes to get our food and if our waitress follows up with how are meal is and if are drinks are full. In my opinion, Grimaldi's surpasses all expectations. This particular restaurant is great and this is why.  1. Staff was prompt and friendly 2. Food is amazing and love the decor 3. Management came to our table on more than one occasion to see if we were   enjoying our food and if we needed anything. It had a family feel as if your grandmother was making sure you were taken care of.  My wife and I get our pizza with pepperoni and extra basil, it is simply fantastic but the plain cheese and basil is more that satisfactory. get the large, it is only $2 more. We make sure to go here every time we visit Las Vegas. One last thing that made me enjoy this restaurant even more. There was an older couple next to us that looked as if they were from Duck Dynasty or some other hillbilly lifestyle. They were basically old school Vegas and I thought it was fantastic that this nice restaurant was a place of diversity where you can see a redneck, someone in a suit or a family. Great food is for all to enjoy."}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn. I know good pizza, and I know great pizza. This is definitely good pizza, but it doesn't compare to what Grimaldi's dishes out under the Brooklyn bridge. I think it would have earned another star if my pizza spent another minute in the oven. Grimaldi's pizza have a half life of about 10 minutes before the thin crusts start to get mushy, I would recommend ordering yours slightly well done."}
{"text":"Kinda hard to find at first.  Food was great...we had the free pizza for your birthday but we did add a few toppings.  We sat at the bar and the waitress which was also at the bar was kinda rude.  She could have provided better customer service, seemed like she would rather have been doing something else.  She was very short with us and seemed like she was in a rush which was odd because we were the only people at the bar and there were maybe 10 people in the whole place. I would go back but I would not want the same person waiting on me."}
{"text":"Oh I could eat a slice of their cheese pizza at any point of day. My family flew out to Vegas and we came here twice in a span of four days because we loved it so much. The best part was, of course, the pizza. Thin and perfectly crispy and something about that cheese! The large was a perfect size for our family of four (two toddlers and two adults). Best part was that they gave dough for my kids to play with both times. Why don't all pizza restaurants do this?? Such friendly service each time- I wish there was one close to my house in Virginia. We'd come here all the time!"}
{"text":"Great option in the Fashion Mall after big shopping. Ordered salad and pepperoni pizza. Both are really yummy. Old blue music as the background."}
{"text":"Located in the Palazzo, the atmosphere is casual with a New York vibe. Sinatra playing in the background. Good place for families. Only problem is the menu is very limited to salads or pizza. No traditional pasta entrees. Pizza is thin crust which is my preference. If your into thick crust pizzas, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"I will say the service here is awesome.  Service alone deserves 5 stars.  We had a lovely experience.  We heard about how awesome the pizza is here so we decided to try it.  Nice simple, to the point menu which I like.  There's no kid's menu so just a heads up for you parents out there.  My toddler was not at all interested in the thin crust pizza which is all they have (I think).  The pizza was good but my hubby and I like thick crust.  If you like crunch thin crust then you will probably enjoy coming here a lot more.  They are known as \"New York pizza\" so obviously we came here with that in mind.  However, compared to the pizzas I've had in NY, I still think Grimaldi's was about 3 stars, maybe 3.5."}
{"text":"Not very good. Do not waste your time. I have been to the original one in Brooklyn and it is much better. The place seems to be very chain-like at this point and seems to have departed from the goodness of the original spot.   The pizza looked very unappetizing when it arrived. It had weird blobs of something unattractive (not sure if it was the sauce or the garlic we got on the pizza) that made it difficult to want to eat the whole pizza. The cheese seemed of relatively low quality and the sauce was literally flavorless. I was a bit worried when I looked at their website and saw a Hormel company seal.   I would stay away and try one of the other options around town that is much better."}
{"text":"Awesome salads, so fresh and yummy! Pizza was delish too! Pretty good portions as well! Nice atmosphere! Their cheesecake is too die for!! Nice selections as well! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner last night, sat at the bar. We moved from the east coast not too long ago and have been looking for a place that makes good pizza and this is it, the margherita pizza was top notch! Ashley was our server/bartender and she was wonderful, service was fast and friendly and there was never an empty cup. We'll definitely be back, great place!"}
{"text":"So far this is the best pizza I've had in Arizona! The service is excellent and even when \"someone\" at my table dropped our pizza off the rack and it landed on the floor, management was right on it and brought us another pizza! That's customer service. Recommend this place to all pizza lovers and to anyone looking for a nice night out."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, never have been a big fan of pizza but it's definitely yummy here. Fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, and great dough. Simply amazing check it out!"}
{"text":"Add ricotta cheese as one of your toppings.....WOW!    Best pizza I've ever had, if you don't like it, try it again until you snap out of it.      Absolutely love this pizza, super fresh ingredients......LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter took us here after a 2 hour delayed flight. I had serious need for food. The Mediterranean salad was absolutely wonderful. Greens were fresh and pretty, tomatoes  firm but sweet and the red onions and olives were in just the right amount. I ate 3 bowls :-) So my waistline was happy. We ordered the \"Don\" pizza which is sausage pepperoni and it is meant for 3 people with healthy appetites. It it not Northeast pizza because of the crust (Sorry guys!) but, it is one  of the best I've eaten. I just want a smidge more cheese.   Wait service was excellent, friendly, cute and attentive. They have the outdoor heaters  but they weren't working when we came. I am never cold but strangely so last night which is the only reason I even noticed. They are situated in front on a water fountain that has colored lights, very date nightish. Also very close to \"Tivoli Village\""}
{"text":"We ate at Grimaldi's last night. It was my first experience there. My boyfriend had gotten a free pizza with 1 topping for his birthdate for signing up for their email alerts. We ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The extra topping for the mushrooms was $2.00 . I thought that was a fair price for the topping. The other topping selections have different toppings . Which can get pricey but for what we like its reasonable.  The servers were attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was mood setting. We opted to eat outside because it was busy. The misters were on and for a hot night, the air outside was comfortable.  Our server kept our drinks refilled without us having to ask for refills. The food came out fast . We ordered a house salad before our pizza coming out. OMG the dressing tasted amazing and the mushrooms were delicious that were added to the salad. The pizza we got was yummy. The pepperoni had a little more spiciness then normal pepperoni. The pizza had plenty of pepperoni and mushrooms on it . It was covered with toppings.  The crust was just right. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has THE best pizza I have ever had! My husband and I came here for a date night and ordered a half and half large pizza (leaving us with leftovers - but we're not super big eaters) and a large (meaning GIANT) delicious Caesar salad for us to split, and I ordered a crisp red sangria. The pizza has a perfect puff pastry taste that is light and fluffy. The mozzarella and tomato tastes so fresh and authentic, not like the shredded and canned stuff that is so prevalent. The manager even stopped by to ask how everything was tasting. The waitress went out of her way to help us. The ambiance is relaxing with vintage type Edison bulb chandeliers, calming music, and authentic Italian furnishings. We are very pleased with our experience."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and customer service!  I was kinda disappointed that they don't have breadsticks but they had some bread with oil that was Great! I definitely can't wait to eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the delicious pizza.  It's the perfect combination of crispy and thicknes.  You can tell they use high quality ingredients.  Yes, I do admit the wait is long on weekends but if you want to enjoy fast service and don't mind a dinner date during the week then I suggest you go on the not so busy days.  They don't have much of a appetizer selection, but who needs appetizers with pizza this good! This is one of my favorite romantic places to go with my husband. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a blog I read. I was not disappointed. The pizza had great toppings and was thin with a crispy crust!!  Recommend!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe I haven't written a review for Grimaldi's yet. We literally order pizza from here every single weekend without fail. My husband gets a small white pizza with black olives and pepperoni and I get a personal size white pizza with ricotta cheese. Be wary of the sizes here, everything is HUGE! A small pizza is the size of a Pizza Hut large, so if you're trying to get your own pizza, go for the personal size with the expectation that you will have leftovers.  Their salads are also amazing. The caesar is a crowd fave in my home, as is the spinach. They are lovely additions to your meal if you want to make yourself feel better about scarfing pizza.  The only downside to Grimaldi's, which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5, is their curbside pickup. It is incredibly hit or miss. There are some instances where a server is outside at our car within seconds of us pulling up, there are times where we sit in our car for up to 10 minutes just gazing into the window in their door wondering when someone will come out to say hello. It seems like the curbside pickup must not be a very popular job to have to do for the servers because on multiple occasions we've made eye contact with 2 or 3 people who still don't acknowledge us or come outside, and other times when we've witnessed 2 servers will get into a tiff about who has to come greet us. It's kind of a disaster.  Other than that, the service is usually awesome. The bartenders are all very nice and attentive, and the food is just darn good."}
{"text":"Fav pizza place ever!!! The pepperoni pizza is the best!!! We always bring friends and family here when they come to town and everyone loves it!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to pizza joint in the east valley.  We love the thin, crispy crust and every topping combination we've tried has been better than the last.  To top it all off, their cannolis are to die for.   Our only gripe is the cost.  A large pizza with just two toppings runs you about $25.  We would order every week, if not for the price tag."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza. Everything is fresh and it's not super greasy. Their salads are also good too. This place does get pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights but you can always order pizza to go in advance."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday night after bar hopping, and we got right in, no line.  The waitress gave this bland spiel about how the water and ingredients come from Brooklyn, blah blah, I didn't really care, I don't come from NY, I just like good food.   We got plain sliced french bread as an appetizer (was served with do it yourself balsamic vin and evoo). It seemed like kind of a cheap free appetizer, but whatever it goes with pizza, its Italian.  We ordered Small white pizza with sausage and tomato (pretty damn good), inversion IPA ( which was bottled) and a house pinot grigio, which was ok.  My hubby was blown away by the pizza, I thought it was good, but not the best i ever had. Between the two of us, we finished it off with no leftovers. I definitely want to go again and try a more plain pizza, like red pizza with pepperoni. If my decision is the same after that, I will not return as this place is, in my opinion, too pricey for just two people to eat at."}
{"text":"This was the best pizza experience that I have ever had.. I ate so many pizzas in my life but Grimaldi's was the best.  Thank you so much for being that good, and the place is beautiful, the workers nice and kind, the girl even opened the door for me both time (in & out).. Thank you Grimaldi's you made my day !"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places but the food was OK this time. My pizza came partially burnt and I'm still waiting for a check even though I've been done for about 10 to 15 minutes and it is not busy.   The Manager attempted to accommodate by offering a dessert, but my second pizza was a tad soggy.   My spinach salad was good! Just a burnt pizza and I am still waiting for my check!!"}
{"text":"We went there 2PM for lunch yesterday. The hostess opened the door for us which I found surprisingly nice. I was hoping for a lunch menu, but I was not surprised they only had one menu for lunch and dinner. We ordered 2 coffee and a large pepperoni. My girlfriend doesn't eat a lot, so we had 2 slices left over which we took home. Over all, pizza is very good, crust is a little bit tough for me. Pizza sauce wth fresh basil leaves, cheese and pepperoni are excellent and fresh. Our waitress gave us excellent service by frequent checking and filling our coffee. The end price was about $26 including tip which is not too bad."}
{"text":"I love that they have gluten free pizza.  It's not the best pizza in Vegas for my taste and you have to pay for each ingredients but it's probably the best gluten free pizza near our house.   No delivery or else we might order more often."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! A must whenever I'm in Scottsdale! Their quattro formaggi is amazing-- subbed ricotta for Gorgonzola.  Small salad is huge and more than enough to split pre-pizza.  We got there around 5:30pm on a Sunday and didn't have to wait at all for seating but by the time we left at 7, lots of people were waiting. Bonus: it's less than a 5 minute walk to the Gelato Spot or The Sugar Bowl across the street for dessert."}
{"text":"Pizza was OK, nothing special.  The crust was soggy probably from the moisture in the cheese. Their cheese is really good though."}
{"text":"Good pizza is like good sex...after you've had it, you keep thinking about it, and you want more. Well, I had Grimaldi's pizza tonight and I keep thinking about it and I want more. This pizza is fabulous! The crust could not be more perfectly thin, crunchy on the bottom, and chewy on the top, and just overall stellar. The toppings were sublime.  I sat at the bar, had a couple of cocktails and the best pizza I've had in forever. The bartender, was a great chic. She new how to be friendly and give great service without feeling forced or phony. I told her I had ridden my bike up there, so she offered to wrap up my extra pizza in tinfoil and put it in a plastic bag, so I could fit it in my basket. I had my purse, so a Styrofoam to go thing would have sucked. Styrofoam sucks anyway, but this would have been a space issue.   Anyway, I love this place mucho, mucho.  Try it out to see what I am talking about."}
{"text":"I only ever get the same thing so I can't speak to the whole menu. The antipasto is a great starter: fresh mozzarella and basil, black and green olives, salami and roasted red peppers served with bread. The pepperoni pizza is delicious. Nice, tart sauce and awesome pepperoni. Like I said, it's all I get so my knowledge is limited, but worth trying!"}
{"text":"Bald headed manager tried to kick us out because he illegally asked if our dog was a service animal. Realized he was wrong and left us alone. Hid in the kitchen with a towel in his face. Unfriendly to guests and poor service. Go to the Scottsdale quarter location ."}
{"text":"!!New York pizza at its best!! If you ask me what is the best pizza place in Vegas, I would say Girmaldi's Pizzeria!!Their pizza is exceptional and I love everything about it. Crust is thin and tasty, sauce is authentic and Toppings are high quality and tasty. The Buffalo mozzarella is on point and basil fresh. not to mention that it is a Coal brick oven pizza and you actually can see how they're making it right In front of you!!  Also I love the atmosphere with all that pictures makes you feel you are in NYC!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Market Place Street Plaza. The food is always good the staff is very nice and professional and it's the best value among several other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas and found this place on Yelp. Went there on Friday night and found a packed house with little waiting was was great. Let me make it ease.  Best Pizza I have ever had (I used to own a pizza place) Very good service Prices were very reasonable for what you get.  PIZZA WAS AWESOME."}
{"text":"This is a very reliable go to restaurant when I'm in Vegas. I usually stop in for lunch and have yet to be disappointed. Pizza is amazing.... every bit as good as in the best pizzerias in NY. Next time I'm in Vegas I'm sure I'll be at Grimaldi 's again."}
{"text":"This is a gourmet pizza place so Completely different than most. They don't have some traditional toppings and no ranch. You don't need it though, it's delicious wood fired pizza. They use good meats which is why its a bit pricier. Their pesto pizza is really good too!"}
{"text":"We ordered the small house salad to share between the two of us, which was plenty. Lettuce was cold.and crisp, but the salad overall was pretty bland. Either the vinaigrette was not seasoned enough,  or there was too little of it. But that's not why you came here. The pizza. A large with mushrooms, onions, and pepperoni. Crust was thin and nicely crispy. Mama is from Sicily, so she knows pizza. We both loved it!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Vegas. The Rampart location has a better ambiance over the other locations. Great pizza, great Caesars salad, great cheesecake."}
{"text":"\"... and when you walk across the bridge you have to treat yourself with a slice of pizza from Grimaldis...\" I was told by the concierge in NY... We never made it to the bridge let alone across so this was a treat to see when I saw the sign for it in vegas.   I was waiting for the right time, one of those days where you're bored at home, want to do something but don't want to go out. A stop into here to place a to-go order, a small white garlic sauce pizza with Italian sausage and roasted red peppers came to a price tag of 23.xx   When I got back four people had at it, and everyone enjoyed the pizza.  Little pricey, the staff I interacted with were nice and helpful explaining that everything on the menu is chose your own toppings, they dont have pre-set, pre-defined 'specials'. For half the world who can't order except by combos and numbers I know this will be hard, but use your imagination -- have fun with it :)"}
{"text":"So based on the pictures I thought it would be great. I was not impressed, got a pepperoni pizza(btw what is with the baby pepperoni) with half sausage, had to explain it 3 times till they got it right. Told me 20 minutes for pick up,   I arrive in 20 only to go wait in a 10 minute line for pickups. Only problem he was the bartender and taking other orders while we waited , clearly they don't care about takeout if they have no one dedicated to handling it. They had plenty of people there to help but no one did.  So when I got home I got a cold pizza with very sparse toppings, not much mozzarella, sauce that was way to sweet and crust was lame and too much of it, not a good representation of a Northeast pizza.  Also I guess they figure people in Vegas wont notice it if they serve stale cannolis. What where they 4-5 days old? I will go back to Carmines from now on."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the white pizza with anchovies and the house salad. I get it every time. I have never been one to order anchovies on anything, but trust me you won't regret ordering this pizza. It's perfectly salty, not at all fishy- even my 2 year old loves it!"}
{"text":"Simply awful. I do not recommend eating here.  I was craving pizza and intended to go to Blaze Pizza tonight but didn't realize it was Pi Day ($3.14 pizzas) and the line was wrapped around the building. So I went to Grimaldi's instead since it was just down the street. Next time I'll go to Settebello.   I ordered a Caesar Salad and the Veggie Pizza. The Caesar was fine, it's the pizza that was so disappointing. The pizza was soggy in the middle. So soggy that I couldn't pick up a slice without it sinking and bending in half and the toppings falling off. The veggies on this pizza were boring -- Roma tomato, olives, mushroom, and big slices of white onion. Nothing special at all. Nothing with flavor.    Never again."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful.  We continue to go monthly. What I can't stand is the manager and hostess.  Obnoxious.  We had an argument with him because he would not change the tablecloth at the bar table we sat at.  He said it looks clean. How about the fact that the person got up from the table and sneezed on the cloth? I am writing this as I sit in the bar right now. The hostess tonight knew our tablecloth was dirty, flipped it over and reset the table. Not exactly the best hygiene being practiced here.  Not enough to stop us from coming, but I had to voice a concern."}
{"text":"Just moved here 3 weeks ago from Florida, but I was born in New York City. After  9 years in Florida, we finally found a true Brooklyn born, owner of a fantastic pizza place. Well we found that already here. Wonderful. We've only been there once, but great reviews so far!"}
{"text":"Sure takes them a long time to make a friggin pizza ... :/  But heck I care aboot the food   Pizza crust was thin and enjoyable & crispy Sauce was good, fresh tasting, although could have used more basil and a dash more salt and pepper Pepperoni was good  Don't come here hungry"}
{"text":"I came here with coworkers in a group of 6 people. It was not my choice to go to Grimaldi's because after going to their Fashion Show location, I found their pizza to not be memorable. I never went back until this day when my coworkers wanted to go. I feel the same way, the pizza is ok and I have had better in Vegas.   The pizza is good. It is not bad, but not great. For a chain, I think the taste is just okay but better than Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. The waitress forget my iced tea I ordered then charged me for it. When I brought it to her attention she said she would take it off the receipt, but no apology for forgetting.   What I don't like is their prices and their add toppings per topping and pay per topping. I got a personal white pizza (enough for 1 meal if you are really hungry or 2 meals if you are not that hungry). It has 6 small/medium sized slices. The base price is $10 for a personal sized white pizza. Add artichoke hearts $4, add mushrooms $2, add spinach $2, add mushrooms $2. My pizza is now $20 for a personal size pizza! Hmm did my pizza have truffles on it for that price? I did not even get my sun dried tomatoes or extra garlic because it would cost more $$! I think this is a rip off. You are better off getting large pizzas and splitting them if your party can agree to the pizza type. They really should come up with some pizzas that have the toppings already on there. If you think you are being customized by allowing toppings to be placed on for additional charges, it does not work when it becomes highly overpriced. Well this is a big company and I highly doubt they will ever change their method of pricing per topping, so in that case I highly doubt I would be back (not by my choice).   We did get a free cheesecake for teacher appreciation week and I got strawberry. I was not impressed with the consistency of the cheesecake, it was soft (way too soft and yes there is such a thing). I like a firmer more dense cheesecake personally. The strawberries were kind of odd baked into the cheesecake, so they got weird mushy.   I spent $32 for my personal size pizza, half a small salad I shared, water, and tip and tax. That seems like a lot for what I got."}
{"text":"6/4/2012 Got table blocked right off the bat. Told hostess we needed a table for 3 outside headed out and noticed another group closely following then some confusion as they said they were waiting before us so host gave to them. Waited for party to leave so we could get next one. Waiter never came back to get their check lol they ended up annoyed and came in to pay. Fronts horribly managed.  Sat us at a 2 person table...? Not enough room. Had to ask to be moved. Everything seemed to be fine... at first. They were literally falling all over themselves to help us with drinks etc. Had 3 different servers tell us about the pizzas there and ask us for drink order. Was kind of comical. Pizza came and was good... Our neighboring table that backed up to the wall seemed to be having some sort of issue and the man there jumped up abruptly and then the woman he was eating with did the same. Thought they were fighting... that was until I noticed some visitors on their table. Yes ON their table. That's when we also saw them. It seems Boca park has a rather severe roach problem. We immediately stopped eating when we saw they were scattering less than a foot away from our table and not one or two mind you... Dozens of them were crawling in the bushes and along the wall. I could have and at one point was leaning on that wall. Thankfully they didn't crawl onto our table, our neighbors were't as lucky as one dashed right in there while they were eating.  Told the waitress as we abruptly moved away from the wall. She said they knew... and it was a problem they were having.  The manager came out who was extremely nice and admitted it was a problem and they had to spray several times a week and was going to start spraying everyday. gag! He gave us a discount. It actually read \"roaches\" under the reason for the discount. I wish I were kidding... If it's that bad outside what does the kitchen look like? Here's a tip... when you have a roach infestation don't sit diners right next to it. We took our pizza home but now we are wondering why we even paid for the meal. None of us want to eat it. lol Nasty as hell. Won't ever be back. Part 2... Looks like I'm getting some hate mail from .. employees? or overly ardent Grimaldi lovers? lol They must really love that pizza! Pathetic. Now you are just riling me. I was willing to let this go and never go back... but not now. This is a review site! We had a bad experience. I'm going to write about it! There are roaches there ... outside yes, but the problem is extreme. I grew up here. I know there are roaches outside. This is pretty damn bad or else it wouldn't have been mentioned. No \"Gecko's on a patio\" but then again, that might help them solve their roach problem. I'm not trying to \"ruin the reputation of a restaruarnt,\" (and yes they spelled it wrong, that's a direct quote.) I do have the receipt... would you like me to post it showing the reason, \"roaches\" on the there? It was so bad they have a discount called \"roaches\" in their system. lol It's time they do something about it. When a problem is that severe you don't sit people there! Period. And if its that bad outside I wonder what the kitchen looks like... I'd be MORE than happy to learn that they've taken steps to correct this little black crawly issue and I would LOVE to post that its been fixed on here for all to see... yet no one has contacted me other than really angry pizza lovers. Crazy. Maybe we can just solve this and have the health department come out and take a look. If they don't think its a problem then hey no worries! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had in Vegas!!  Pepperoni awesome, white pizza with artichoke. Service was exceptional!  Waitress even gave my 2 yr old pizza dough to play with. Tiramisu awesome!  I was disappointed with blueberry cobbler cheesecake.   Garden salad good with the sweet red peppers. Will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner and wine here on Sunday and was very impressed.  Came back tonight and it seemed like a different experience. The sausage on the pizza was less than half of what was on our last pizza .. not sure if it was because it was half price wine night or not, but have to say, would not hurry back.  There was hardly any cheese on the pizza itself, very limited sausage and green pepper .  I know we are biased to Rosati's... but it is so much better!"}
{"text":"This one just opened near my house, I didnt know they had others in town until reading the other reviews.  My girlfriend was sick, so I called in carry out.  I got the small Calzone with meatball and the small anti-pasto for us to share.  The Calzone was big and full of meat, but no sauce so pretty dry.  I thought they would have some inside or at least a container for dipping.  Definately needed pizza sauce.    I thought the Anti Pasto was a salad and not just an asortment of the ingredients.  I saw another review after the fact saying you can get greens and dressing with it, which would have been more to my liking.  The ingredients alone werent bad, just not what I expected or really wanted.    The atmosphere of the restaurant was kind of odd.  Like it didnt know if it was supposed to be nice or just basic and focus on the food.  With a menu consisting of only pizza, calzone and salad, I would expect not a lot of frills.  The decor tried to be fancy just like the servers uniforms/aprons, but the tables were covered in the old fashion red checker patern table cloth (more in line with the menu).  All in all it was ok food, enough for two of us for under $30.  I will probably try again for lunch since its nearby and go with pizza and a caesar salad to avoid the lack of dressing/sauce."}
{"text":"It's rather annoying to get to this place from Treasure Island across the street.  If there's an easier way I don't know what it is.  :p  Got two personals to carry out.  They came out quick and were delicious.  The cheese looked and tasted different than I'm used to, but I liked it.  I'd eat at again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  There was no wait.  It's very nice on the inside.  They serve some of the best New York style thin crust pizza I have ever tasted.  We couldn't believe the price either.  It's very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Always get good service and great food from the salad to the pie. The sausage n spinach was fantastic."}
{"text":"Had to respond to swarup b.  Actually, the pizza at Grimaldi's in Scottsdale is pretty much identical to the pizza at Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.  We were surprised when we ate it in Brooklyn, because we expected old fashioned drippy cheese NY pizza, but apparently that's not what people call \"authentic\" NY pizza anymore....this is (coal-fired oven, crisp crust, etc.)  We enjoyed our meal (pizza and house salad), but liked the atmosphere in Brooklyn more (this one is just too new and sterile)."}
{"text":"had the place to ourselves on a thurs nite (5/19) so...service great, mgr came over and asked if we had eaten here before \"nope\" so he said he wanted to buy dessert, \"great, thank you\" oreo cheesecake was good... now.... pizza...pricey by 2-4 bucks but was very good. can't go wrong with your toppings but the riccotta was not my cup of tea (wife liked it on her pizza). definetly going back to try it again... great crust"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.  Not the best pizza around but not bad.  Had pepperoni and artichoke which was amazing! Definitely getting that again.  Kind of expensive for pizza. I don't go here often because of that.  But sign up for their birthday email and you get a free large $18 pizza!  Awesome."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their pizzas are always made with fresh toppings and many gourmet choices to pick from. I have yet to actually eat at the restaurant but more times than not I sit at the bar and get served a drink from their friendly wait staff while I wait for my order. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yes, it was only 10:30am, but my alcohol-soaked brain was screaming, \"I need pizza!\" A quick Yelp Search directed me to Grimaldi's inside the Venetian Palazzo on the second floor.   Like a rookie, I donned sweat pants, a hoodie and a backpack and made my way into the Mecca of Vegas glitz and glamor. I'm pretty sure most people thought I was either lost or plotting to rob the place, but Grimaldi's still let me inside...  Ross, bartender extraordinaire, made my morning. He made sure I had an icy pint of delicious beer that never seemed to get warm or reach the bottom. His cocktails (yes, plural; don't judge) were also amazing, capped off with witty reparteé. Strong enough that I didn't inhale them, but still didn't taste like jet fuel or a pending hangover.  Bomb ass pepperoni pizza. Thin crust with crispy edges, delicious sauce, fresh mozzarella and meats that tasted fresh from the butcher. Enough said.  There is full menu service at bar, which also has two TVs in plain sight, so you don't have to miss the game. Fun, funky, unique decor, including wine bottle chandeliers! Front and back indoor patios for people watching - a lot of Armani-clad Europeans kind of people-watching.  Grimaldi's is a very entertaining and satisfying little lunch spot! If you're lucky enough to sit at the bar with Ross, you may not want to leave."}
{"text":"I ABSOLUTELY loved the pizza!! Seriously soooo good, tomatoey sauce, real milky mozzarella, the Italian sausage was excellent and the pepperonis were nice and small,not salty and not overly greasy. I had a great glass of vino at the bar, also had a good selection of draught beers includeing oberon! I really enjoyed my time. Bartender was very nice as well"}
{"text":"Could be the worst pizza I've ever had. 10$ pizza with a 30$ price tag. Grossly overrated. Will not be coming back. The dough was undercooked and for some reason there was small pools of water on the surface of the pizza. However I don't remember ordering ice cubes as one of my toppings. Toppings are ridiculously expensive 3 dollars for sausage, 4 dollars for peppers and so on. These prices would have been live-able had there been toppings covering the entire pizza, however, to our disappointment one slice was almost entirely covered in Grimaldi's signature sub par sauce with no toppings to speak of. Waitress however was friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a dinner reservation with some friends. First thing I noticed was the pizza. It's setup right in front of you so you can visually see how your meal is being made, that was fantastic. So we were settled immediately and our drink orders where taken, this is the kind of service I look forward to when I'm going out. The service was impeccable I was thoroughly impressed. Definitely somewhere I'd like to go again and I would recommend. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and great service too! My girl and I went here to sit down and have a pizza. It was our first time here. This place looks nice inside, brick walls and has a very tall ceiling. We ordered the Caesar Salad and a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni and red peppers.   Tip: The \"small\" salad size is big enough for two people to have one serving of salad. We got the \"large\" size salad and it was enough for 4 people. The way the pizza works is they have a set price for the sizes (small, medium, large) and then each of your toppings cost extra. But the toppings can get pretty expensive. So essentially for a large I think it was $16. And that is just the crust and sauce. We then added sausage, pepperoni and red peppers and I think our pizza alone came out to $24. So you can see that if you start adding lots of toppings the pizza will get quite expensive.   The pizza was delicious. Pepperoni was so good and so was the sausage. Had a nice little spice to it. My only complaint (and this isn't the restaurant's fault) is that I like the crust to be a tad bit thicker so I can hold the pizza slice by the crust and have the slice stick straight out. This crust is very thin so if you hold it by the crust the entire slice bends down to the ground.   Our server, Daniel was very good. He was working the bar as well as our tables."}
{"text":"Pizza is phenomenal, I don't understand why so many 4 star reviews.  HEY people, this is good as it gets with pizza!  Simple menu, good food, great service and draft beer.  Located in a great place, what else do you need?   Garlic Bread would be nice... but eh? whatever...."}
{"text":"Everytime we come here, the pizza is consistantly great! We usually get the white pizza with ricotta, mushroom, and meatball. Sometimes we order the antipasto which is pretty standard, nothing to rave about. The last time we went, we found out they make their own desserts and there was some kind of special on them. I believe we tried the oreo cheesecake? It was so worth it! They only bad thing is the parking. Theres just not that many spaces especially during the busy times. The service is great and if you have kids, they give them pizza dough to play with."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have ever had in my life!! I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas and eat here again. Highly recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have ever had in my life!! I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas and eat here again. Highly recommend you try it out!   A+++++"}
{"text":"Parking (3/5): Parking is pretty good during non-rush hour, but it can be difficult to find one when they are busy. Also, they do share their parking space with Café Rio and a dessert place.   Ambiance (5/5): This restaurant has the perfect ambiance of a NYC pizzeria. It's always busy and customers are always chatty. It's loud and during some game nights patrons at the bar area can get bit loud. But as I said before, it reminds me a lot best pizzerias in NYC.   Service (5/5) Service is excellent at this Grimaldi's; from waiters to bartender, you are treated with a smile. They would also make proper suggestions on if you trying to venture into exotic toppings area. They keep their pizza in the oven if you running late to pick it up, which keeps the pizza hot and fresh until you get home. This is the best way to do a takeout.     Food (5/5) This is the best pizzeria I've been to in Henderson or LV. I believe that this might be the best Grimaldi's location in NV. Every time I'm craving a pizza I come here to get my favorite custom pizza. I get their large pizza with marinara, pesto sauce (w/ olive oil), meatballs, and extra cheese. It usually lasts me for 2 days and tastes exactly same when you re-heat it the next day in an oven. Other item that I love to eat at this place is their caprese salad; it's fresh, flavourfull and light. Their cheese is not to chewy and it literally dissolved in your mouth. My mouth is watering just writing about it.  Their desserts are excellent as well, I would highly recommend blueberry cheesecake.   Overall (5/5), I think that this is the best pizzeria for me until I've been to other famous places in LV for proper comparison. If you can look over minor parking issues then you will love this place."}
{"text":"On Nov 9th I accompanied my sister and brother in law to Grimaldi's Pizzeria. We ordered the salad which was good, Followed by a large pizza with sausage, jalapenos, garlic and extra cheese which also great, But by far the desert was the best cheese cake I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"Nice quiet spot in a corner of the Palazzo that served well for a group meal with colleagues. Decor is tasteful (upscale warehouse style) and relaxed for an overall casual dining experience.   The menu is focused on their pizzas and service was exceptional.  Good bar with plenty of beer on tap.  It's also an affordable option considering the strip pricing.   Tip from our server:  crust is thin.   Order fewer than 4 toppings to prevent it from being soggy.  Worked!"}
{"text":"THIS is how thin crust pizza should be done! Period! Everyone take lessons from this place!  Stopped by during our last visit to Sin City and were pleasantly surprised.  The kids' godfather (how appropriate! - & he's Italian too!) recommended it.  The cheese was thin but tasted thick. Crust incredibly thin but filling. Cooked just right.  There's one in El Segundo we'll drive out to one of these days."}
{"text":"In honor of National Pizza Day, I figured it was high time to review my favorite pizza spot. Came here back in October with Randall S. There's many locations around the city (I like the one in the fashion show mall) but we happened to be on his side of town that night. We decided to call-in our order because it was a super cold and windy night. Netflix kind of night.  If you're in a rush, Grimaldi's isn't for you. There's usually a substantial wait for your pizza whether you dine-in or not. But this pizza is worth the wait. Its totally authentic and made in a coal brick-oven. With handmade mozzarella, secret recipe dough and pizza sauce. It's just how you imagined pizza from New York would taste. On one occasion we dined in @ fashion show with his sons. To keep them occupied, our server gave them a piece of dough and small pizza tray for them to play with while we waited for the food. His sons loved kneading the dough like mini pizza makers. Being a mommy myself, I thought that was a great idea.   On this particular night, we ordered The Don & a large Caesar Salad. Added some extra toppings to our pizza. My tip, don't go too crazy with the toppings because it gets pretty pricey. It's all fun and games until the bills come out lol.   Would've given 5 stars but as we walked back to the car, we noticed signage for \"curbside service\". We were annoyed since it was such a cold night, we thought it would've been the perfect time to take advantage. But the woman taking our phone order never mentioned this service to us. Management should address this. Other than that this place is spot on."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4 stars if not for the chaos...I can't blame the place, it's popular.  Problem is it's almost like a Chuck E Cheese with all the kids...very loud.  The pizza is stellar, no doubt.  Bar area too small but when you are raking it in from families can't blame ownership.  Just know not ideal for romantic dinner or couples dinner given environment.  Decent wine options and service was very good."}
{"text":"In searching for someplace new to eat in Vegas, Grimaldi's came up and had pretty good reviews. So, based on the featured \"coal-burning\" oven, it was a must-try.  The place is a pretty cool retro-modern looking, table-and-chair, checkered tablecloth, cloth napkin eatery with available(? we weren't asked if we wanted to sit outside) al fresco seating, open kitchen, and full-service? bar. I liked the \"renewable\" wine bottle chande-lights.  For the three of us, we ordered a Large Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza, a Personal Mushroom pizza, and the Antipasto, which I HAD TO TRY because of the \"house-made\" Fresh Mozzarella. The Pepperoni and Italian Sausage pizza was pretty good. Good sauce, adequate amount of topping, and a crisp crust, although it did have a somewhat disturbing amount of char on the bottom of it. The mushroom pizza, in my opinion, was a bit scant on one of the most inexpensive of toppings. The Antipasto was quite good, consisting of olives,  oven-roasted red peppers, Genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, and sliced bread. The winner on that plate was the \"house-made\" fresh mozzarella, with the sweet oven-roasted red peppers making a good accompaniment on the sliced bread with the salami and cheese. Oh, and a splash of olive oil and balsamic vinegar (from the leaky bottle)!   The service could use some work, as our waiter was kinda lost. First, messing up a simple one diet coke, one regular coke, one iced tea order, bringing two regular cokes instead and blaming it on the dispenser. Whuh? And nowhere to be found when we were ready to pay our check. He also screwed up our neighboring tables' pizza order, leaving one of three women sitting there watching her friends eat their pizza while hers was re-ordered. And I don't think they put a rush on it. Having back-of-the-house experience, her order should have been re-made \"on-the-fly\", meaning  it should have been made top priority.  Aside from the little snags, I would definitely go back to try the Caprese salad and some other pizza combinations."}
{"text":"Lived in Brooklyn for 12 years, 1 mile away from the original.  Finally got here.   a few misses but their customer service is top notch, even if their floor managers make a bad decision or two.  Good pizza..."}
{"text":"I love grimaldis. I really do. I frequent the eastern and rainbow locations at least every other week.  Casey the bartender 5 stars.   I got tired of hearing the larger girl complain about her schedule for the first 15 minutes of my visit and another waitress running behind the bar to text.   Again, I love grimaldis but this place is weird."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza around by far. And the staff is amazing. Danica and Nikki and the rest take such good care of their customers and are always attentive. My wife and I always think about trying some place new on the weekend but time after time we end up back here because we know what we're going to get. This is our go-to for pizza and wine."}
{"text":"We had a delightful table on the patio for late lunch.  Our waitress Andrea was extremely helpful, attentive and pleasant.  We especially appreciated her suggestions about ordering based on the extremely large portions.  The pizza, salad, freshly brewed passion fruit tea and cheesecake made in house were all tasty.  Overall, it was a very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"The pizza is very good but not something I will crave. Service was bad. My boyfriend was looking at the drink list and she grabbed it. I had to go to the hostess stand to get a menu so we could look at it. Again, she came back with our salad and grabbed the menu before we could order wine. So we gave up and stuck with water.  Atmosphere - at 6pm (on a Wed) everyone with 3 kids showed up and it got loud fast. Until then it was calm and peaceful on the patio with just 2 other tables filled.  Doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"Doing some work in PHX this week, and thought I'd give Grimaldi's a shot (I've seen their billboard ads a few times). I looked at the reviews and figured \"the diet is over\" so let's grab a pizza.  They have a lunch special including a 6\" pizza, Caesar salad and dunk for $9.49. I asked for my pizza with 1/2 pepperoni, but they can't do that (apparently the pizza are pre-made?)   Salad comes out in the smallest bread plate ever... It's good, but really small?!?  Pizza comes out and it's great! I just wish I could have had 1/2 pepperoni.  Waitress disappears upon delivery, so manager has to help me get the check?   All in all, a pretty \"ok\" experience... Here's the rundown:  Satisfied? Sure Return? Probably not Advocate? Nope"}
{"text":"I loved this place! I wish they had one in San Diego. I loved the thin \"New York Style\" pizza with the perfect crust. I went with a large party so I had the opportunity to try different pizzas. I tried pepperoni, a pepperoni and sausage, a veggie that had onions, mushrooms and olives, and they were all so good. I loved the garlic powder topping on the table. We were all asking to pass it around as soon as someone was done using it. They also had oregano on the table as well as crushed pepper and cheese. They had a full bar with full selection of wine."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's never disappoints!! We had pizza of course, we ordered a bunch of pizzas for a table of 12 and let me say that my preferred were the Margherita and White pizzas. Although all the others were yummy it was just my preference but my son likes The Don pizza! I also had a caprese salad and it was probably the best caprese salad I have ever had. let's not forget the garlic powder and the balsamic and oil on the table. I wish there was a Grimaldi's by me in San Diego!"}
{"text":"What better than late night pizza! Came in at 1:30am and they still offered us to dine in. They close at 2am. Thank you Grimaldi's! Oh yeah, and the pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Not much more to say. We were there with a large party and they were able to cut separate checks and fill some strange and complicated orders.  Good Service!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a Las Vegas pizza equivalent of the San Francisco Bay Area's Amici's. Grimaldi's comes close. The pizza is made with a relatively thin crust, but it could be thinner. The brick oven definitely helps improve crust quality. Pizza was topped by a high-quality pepperoni. Service was friendly and efficient. Great dessert too, loved my chocolate cheesecake. :P Only disappointment: their crushed red pepper is not hot enough."}
{"text":"My experience here must have been quite the exception as reviews and friends experiences seems well. I feel my 2 stars was generous. Other than the manager, most else was a zero. Dined here after the Cardinals game on a Saturday night around 10:30. Was glad to see that they were open to 12:00. After being seated it took 10 min + to be greeted despite only a few tables in the restaurant . By the time the manager stopped by we were talking about going elsewhere. We should have!  Eventually ordered a large half garden, half margarita. That's it.  It came pretty quick but after the first bite (garden side) the pizza was disappointing. No flavor and they forgot the tomato sauce. Thankfully the manager was quick to check in and quickly offered to make another. The new pie was better but somewhat watery. The crust was good but it still needed a ton of Parmesan and garlic power to have much flavor. The margarita side was better but also need excessive Parmesan to taste well.  When it came time to check out it took several minutes to track down the waitress but not that big of a deal. We had a decent amount of pizza left over to box up which was boxed for us. Surprisingly it came back piled up into one small box. Is this normal to box pizza in a pile??? Wish I had taken a picture! Kind of comical at this point of the experience."}
{"text":"Service has gone down in the last 5 years progressively. Pizza still delicious as ever. The ingredients you can tell are quality and fresh and those making your meal either have a great pride or are just lucky. Either way you're in for a treat with the pizza. It's what other franchises wish they could be. Stop in and ignore the service and just enjoy a great pie."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza! Outstanding service! Tony's recommednations were spot-on! The Caesar Salad was almost perfect -- just a bit too much croutons. A medium \"The Don\" was perfect for three adults. We only wish we had room for dessert! Very reasonably prices, this fairly large restaurant is tucked down a hallway in The Palazzo Las Vegas, so don't give up. It's definitely worth a look!"}
{"text":"Wandered here with my co-worker David B. for a pizza lunch. We were both interested in pizza and thought we'd come split one and a salad for lunch. He had been here two times before on this trip and recommended it. The pizza was fine (we split a small, top-your-own with pepperoni and sausage), although I wasn't sure about the taste of the sausage topping (but don't get me wrong, I still ate my half). Prior to the pizza, we also split a tomato mozzarella salad. This was good (hard to get that salad too wrong) and we both left the meal feeling full. They don't have Coke products, so while I would have liked a nice Diet Coke with my meal, I stuck with water. It's set away from the casino noise, which was nice, and certainly gives you ample portions."}
{"text":"Great family place! Most restaurants give kids crayons while waiting. Here they give the kids pizza dough. Very cute! It keeps them busy longer, you also have a nice view of the pizza oven. Lighting is on the darker side but i enjoy the calm ambiance. The food is really good. They have menu items come in and out, so that makes me sad. The first time I was here they had buffalo pizza (yum!!) and a pumpkin cheesecake. When I went back another time they didn't have that, so we had something else, and it was años good. Their Greek salad is really good. I also really enjoy their tomato, mozzarella.   Any meal here is always good. They pizza is just the right amount of crispy. It's better to go with a group so you can make room for desert.   My in laws are from out of town, a Grimaldi's was build by them but when they come to town, they still want to come here. They swear this location is better."}
{"text":"The cheese they use on the pizza is delicious.  We had \"The Don\" pizza. It's authentic thin crust Italian pizza.  We had great service.    Next time I'm in Vegas, I would visit again."}
{"text":"The best pizza in New York is in Time Square. And this reminds exactly of that!"}
{"text":"Tried this pizza it was ok. The crust was nice crispy & thin. But, the toppings were just the average toppings & not very generous. Service staff was friendly which is great. But, unfortunately won't be going there anymore. Too bad it's just around the corner from where I live."}
{"text":"This will be a short review, since I have reviewed another Grimaldi's in more details. This location has same type of NY style (thin) pizza the original in NYC. I ordered my personal favorite with marinara/pesto sauce and meatballs and the girl that I took on the date got salad (strike one for her :).   She was bit picky on what she wanted and the kitchen added onions to her salad, when the server found out he convinced her to return the salad and get a new one made just for her. The service was amazing.   I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to try out a NY style pizza."}
{"text":"I'm generally not a big fan of chains but Grimaldi's is one of the exceptions.  We were fortunate enough to visit the original location in NYC a long time ago and are happy they now have locations all over.  The location at the Palazzo has a great staff and the food is always very good.  The restaurant is very open and spacious and they don't jam the tables together. They go above and beyond to make sure you are enjoying the dining experience.    I always enjoy the annual birthday large one topping pizza. I also like how they offer to serve you your first slice of pizza.  Their desserts are awesome and homemade.  The entire staff seems to be entire is staff is super friendly and engaging.  The bottom line is Grimaldi's provides great food and atmosphere at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Service was extremely slow for us last Tuesday.  They may have been short-staffed as our waitress was also the bartender.  The folks who came after us almost left after they were seated for the same reason."}
{"text":"My first time having pizza from Grimaldi's... I ordered a Traditional with ricotta for pickup. Not bad, but the pizza definitely doesn't travel well (assuming it wasn't sitting forever before I picked it up). All in all it was pretty good, good enough that I'll give it another try and dine in."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and great atmosphere. The staff is always friendly even if the wait is long. We love the Don and the white garlic pizza. Delicious crust and everything is fresh. It's very busy Saturday nights but definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places on the valley. The menu isn't big but, the portions are. The pizza is delicious along with the wine, salads and desserts. We try to come here on a regular basis. Sign up for their birthday club and get a free pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza definitely satisfied my cravings after watching one of them 'Pizza Wars' types shows on the Food Network.  The pesto pizza was awesome.  This ain't your normal pizza joint and it's priced accordingly so if you are okay with spending $40 on great pizza and drinks, then check it out."}
{"text":"I LOVE pizza, but I have always considered myself a deep dish girl until I tried Grimaldi's. I would probably never have tried it if my co-workers hadn't ordered it for the team for lunch one day. It's a little expensive for pizza and the restaurants are usually pretty busy, but after having it I was immediately hooked. My favorite Grimaldi's toppings are the italian sausage and ricotta cheese, but also love their tiny pepperoni. Delicious!  I've been to both the Scottsdale Quarter and Old Town locations. I'd say the pizza is equally great at both locations. The Old Town location is a little larger, but super busy any time I've been there.   The only negative I have about Grimaldi's is the way they charge per topping, regardless of the size of your pizza. Chicken is going to cost you $5 whether you order a small or a large, which is strange to me. If you order a small you're obviously getting significantly less chicken.   Overall, despite it being a little more than I generally want to pay for pizza, it's totally worth it. The wood-fired taste and perfect thin crust make it really difficult not to go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my top three pizza restaurants.  It is the one I most frequent and the service is always first rate.  I would recommend this place highly the salad is out of this world as well.  They have added new items to their menu and they are just as mouth watering as the pizza.  It a great family friendly place as well the children can be entertained by the pizza tossing and they are given balls of dough to keep their active hands busy."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is one of our favorite places for pizza.  Nice casual atmosphere with outdoor seating available.  Take-out is also available.    You basically choose as many fresh ingredients as you want for your pizza.  We usually opt for sausage, mushrooms and tomatoes....all on a thin crust.  Everything is tasty, the cheese is great, ingredients are fresh and the crust is thin and tasty.    Also been to the one in fashion show on the strip but the one in summerlin is much better in terms of vibe and quality of the pizza."}
{"text":"If you come here make sure you ask for Tommy! He was amazing and made my first time experience here GREAT! Grimaldi's is very lucky to have him as a server here! :)"}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent. Pizza crust was delicious and so crispy... just like real NYC pizza"}
{"text":"Good pizza, not too greasy like some. We sat down for dinner and my wife noticed fresh pizza sauce and pepper on the table cloth. The sauce had been wiped over. When she told our server she responded they would take care of it when we left. Need I say more? It takes more than good pizza to get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"This is my fave pizza in LV, but I think they changed their pepperonis recently and I'm not a fan of that. (they used to use large ones but my most recent meal was those little tiny circle ones)  Great salads too. Servers are always really nice and it's easy to do carry-out orders. Definitely my go-to place for pizza right now."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Girmaldi's ever since my friend moved out to Arizona.  Last time she was in California she even brought me a menu.  The menu looked really simple but being a pizza lover I knew I could create a masterpiece.    We went in around 5 pm and the place was starting to fill up.  We were sat right away and our waitress Crystal greeted us promptly.  She shared a little about the menu and immediately got our drink orders.  Our friends ordered beers and we had white wine.    Before the bartender could even pour the drinks Crystal had waters for everyone at our table.  She also took our order as soon as we were ready as it was starting to really fill up and she knew we were hungry.  When the pizza's arrived we realized they were huge.  Three of us got personal pizzas and our other two friends shared a small.  There was so much food that we were all able to share.  I ordered a personal pizza with red sauce, garlic, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  The sauce was so fresh and the crust was amazing (the crust is my favorite part).  All of the ingredients were great! It was also neat to watch the cooks toss the dough around.   For dessert we shared tiramisu and Oreo cheesecake. Both were amazing.  I cannot wait to go back to Arizona and have some more delicious pizza.  Wish they had a few in California."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Maricopa County, AZ.  I have lived in the Phoenix area all my life and this is the best.  Our last visit Wednesday, 10/30/13 we ordered Large, Pepperoni, Sausage, Onion, and Mushroom.  So good!!!!  Service is great, and everyone that works there are friendly and professional.  HIGHLY RECOMMAND!!!"}
{"text":"I've ventured to the Is place once more. A friend really wanted to go and I didn't want to be rude. The service is still terrible but the food was warm. My friends food came out before mine and I don't eat any kind of pork products, so their large sausage pizza sat in front if me for a good 7-8 minutes before I got my pizza. Which the food runner then put under my friends pizza. That was very uncomfortable. I tried to remove it from under there but since we still had our dirty salad plates that hadn't been picked up there was no room. The server never came back to check so I was left in a non pleasant situation. But hey at least the food was good....  Right ?!"}
{"text":"Tuesday is the day to go for great pizza and half price wine. My friend and I sat at the bar and were informed that \"tonight is wine night\" The bartender suggested we try a bottle we might not try otherwise because of the higher price.We agreed and took her suggestion and ordered the \"Trouble Maker\". She also suggested a sausage and fresh roasted red pepper pizza to compliment the wine. She was right! It was a great combination. Our pizza was delicious, crisp and flavorful service was great, the bartenders are very friendly and kept my friend and I laughing  through out the night. We will be returning soon."}
{"text":"5 star service from Ross even at 2am. His service was way better than what I've received at some super fancy restaurants!"}
{"text":"Lunch special is always a must. Service from the time you walk in, greeted by the hostess and seated to your table you are immediately greeted by your server. I absolutely love it here.   Salad is always fresh but the pizza...oh the pizza is perfecto!"}
{"text":"The service was atrocious. While the pizza was indeed pretty good I couldn't believe how awful the service was. There was attitude from the hostess to the server to the busser. I'm a frequent flyer to vegas and I've never really had service that was as bad as this place.  The server forgot a topping for my friends pizza and disappeared for 30 mins. We had to ask for the check, then asked for them to take our payment. Maybe it was an off day but wow I expected better. I will stick with grand lux for a casual meal if I'm at the palazzo"}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA!!! Quattro with pepperoni is life changing. Place gets packed so call a head. They also shut down at some point in the day to resort the wood oven. Pizza is absolutely incredible though!"}
{"text":"Great service and solid pizza. The big question - does it compare to Brooklyn?  Almost. I remember the original being even thinner and more piping hot. Good though"}
{"text":"We had a cheese and mushroom pizza. We order salads before the pizza and they showed up at our table 5 minutes after the pizza. I like a cheeze pizza where toppings cover the whole piece. The cheese covered only about half or 2/3 thirds of each piece and they were chintzy on the mushrooms The pizza is simply overprice. The manager apologize for the service and gave us an employee discount. I would not go back again unless someone picked up the tab."}
{"text":"If you like great pizza and poor service, this is the place for you. Run by kids...not an adult leader in the bunch. Like I said, the pizza is great...servers are inattentive and slow."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza at 1:55 p.m. and was told 30 minutes to come and pick up, and it wasn't ready till 3:00 p.m. Granted, it was Super Bowl Sunday, but no manager came by to apologize, as I sat at the bar for 40 minutes waiting...."}
{"text":"The people at the front entrance were discourteous and apathetic. I called 30 minutes prior to bringing in a group of eight to see if they needed a call ahead. I gave them my name and they said they would plan on my group. I got to the restaurant and the teenagers at the front told me that they had another group in front of me and that it would be about an hour wait. I was told that it would be best to call and make a reservation for that size of group. I informed them that I called 1/2 an hour before and was told that they \"don't do\" call aheads, they only take reservations. I asked why they didn't tell me that on the phone and have me make a reservation the young girl shrugged. Lousy customer service."}
{"text":"Loved it here.  The only bad part of our dining experience was being mad at ourselves for taking so long to come here.  The hostess was very pleasant, our waitress came to our table immediately and took our drink order, then brought my kids pizza dough to play with!  They had a blast and not one time did we hear \"when will our pizza be here\"  what a wonderful way to keep the kiddos occupied.  We had the Mediterranean salad and a large pepperoni pizza.  It was soooo good.  The sauce had a great flavor and just the right amount of cheese and pepperoni.  It can be pricey once you start adding toppings and extras but its a great time and worth it.  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place made the pizza really good i enjoyed and will be back again.  The crust was perfect and the meat was of high quality!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for delicious pizza on a thin crust, this is the place. Love to sit on the patio on a nice day and have their Greek salad and plain cheese pizza. Always hits the spot. So light and delicious."}
{"text":"I got a large mozarella, ricotta, meatballs and sauce. I ate all of it. it was awesome. Can't wait to try the original NY one."}
{"text":"Pizza, calzone, and salad are really what they do and they do it so well you will not miss the typical busy Italian-American menu. Fresh hot thin wood fired pizza.  We had the margherita and ate so fast we didn't take a photo. It took a while to get our pizza but it may be  because they were busy and they make them fresh. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The food was fantastic and the service was awesome! Best food we have had in Vegas."}
{"text":"The pizza and salads here are very good.  However, this restaurant can be very busy, with wait times of up to 45 minutes.  I called one Friday to check how busy they were on Friday evenings. The person on the phone assured me that if we got there around 5 p.m. we could get a table right away but when we got there at 5:15, they told us we would have to wait about 45 minutes for a table.  I grumbled.  Miraculously, the manager found us a table after only 15 minutes.  But I did see many people walk away when told of the wait times.  Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Grimaldi's for years and I finally made it here! My friend and I got lucky and showed up on a Tuesday so to our surprise they offered 1/2 off glasses and bottles of wine.  It's hard for me to get too complex when it comes to Pizza, so I stuck with the basics. Garden salad and pepperoni pizza. Both were really great.   What I couldn't help but notice was the relaxing environment. Open kitchen, brick walls... it was cozy but very casual. There was quit a diverse mix of diners ranging from us gals grabbing an early dinner to families with children and everyone in between.  My friend thought she had read somewhere that they imported their water from New York to make the dough at one point in time. We asked, it wasn't the case anymore. But now they do triple filter to get the water to get the dough as authentic to New York style as possible!  Grimaldi's... simple and classic!"}
{"text":"Well waited not long before they said they'll text when our table is ready. Well they texted, but table wasn't ready. Waited another 20 mins. While waiting , we noticed the waitress was cleaning the tables off of plates. One guy came in and flip the table cloth over to use again. And set the table. It's dirty. How can they do this? Or sneezed on. Not right. Got our table but still had to wait 25 minutes to get our order. Not good."}
{"text":"5 stars alone for refusing to serve ranch! Thanks, Grimaldi's, for preventing customers from ruining their fine pizza. Ranch on Papa John's is ok. Ranch on thin, crisp coal fired crust is not.  Grimaldi's really is our favorite pizza in town. It's not as good as Pizzeria Bianco, but Grimaldi's is just a mile and one phone call from being enjoyed in the comfort of my own home. Besides the awesome crust, I love the whole milk mozzarella. The sauce is ok. Toppings are good too. We always ask for a margherita even though it's not on the menu-- it's a quick way to ask for a tomato, basil and garlic pizza.  Although we mostly do take-out, service has been consistently good for the little that we interact with them. If you're on their mailing list, you can get a free large pizza on your birthday."}
{"text":"Came here while in town on vacation.  We were with a larger group so we shared 3 pizzas and 3 salads.  The pesto pizza was to die for and the white pizza was good too.  If you're in the mood for pizza in Vegas I'd definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch outside on the patio. Ordered the spinach salad which was SO good! The toppings of this salad were, cheese, bacon, onion, cherry tomatoes, and of course the spinach and the dressing. We also ordered the Don pizza which is basically just a meat topping pizza. (Sausage, meatball, pepperoni)   Our service was good and she checked up on us a couple of times. The food tasted great and the ambiance was nice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza I got was no good, and I was so disappointed after hearing great reviews.  Not nearly as good as Pizza Hut or Dominos, and the waiter was just sort of blah and came around now and then, not very interested.  As I was leaving, I asked to talk to the manager, but he didn't make it there within a couple of minutes, so I left, and I won't go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service.   Stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. $20 for a small pizza :-/ granted it was like 16-18\", but it wasn't worth it.  For context, we ordered takeout 25 minutes before closing on a Sunday.   The service was decent. The buffalo chicken special was kind of gross.   The place seems corporate.  I'd try it again - might have been an off night / bad timing."}
{"text":"Still my favorite pizza place!  The pepperoni and ricotta is so good.  The service is always great.  We dine in and sometimes order it to go and the pizza is always delicious."}
{"text":"Pizza is AWESOME! The only place I will order pizza from in Vegas. Thin crust with several toppings to choose from. Even artichoke hearts. Great outside patio and bar. Nothing like a cold beer and grimaldis pizza!"}
{"text":"My kids loved the pizza. We came in during lunch hour and sat immediately. My son has some issues with heat and being that it was 105 outside and we had a bit of a walk to get there he wasn't feeling too great. Our waiter saw my son and was so kind and quickly kept the ice water coming for him. He also suggested where to go in the Fashion Mall to get a ride back to our hotel if we needed assistance. Will definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Grimalidis had a top quality product. The word is had. We always went to the one on Eastern and have to say tops every time! Once the location at Boca park opened because it was closer we went. It was also great.  Well, was back this summer to the Boca Park location and all I can say is that If I wanted a dry over cooked pizza then it was good. Sooooo disappointed.  They always used the best pepperoni. Good quality cheese and sauce was always flavorful. What happened guys?  Guess I'll be going Chicago style or driving down to the Eastern location to see if it's still good."}
{"text":"Great service, plenty of options on the menu, our chipper waiter gave us time to mull over the menu. The wedge salad was divine! The pizza was incredibly salty. I hate Hormel pepperoni. The sodium is so distracting, I can scarcely enjoy whatever it is on. Will likely come back, but hold the pepperoni. Also, the waiter said they didn't have strawberry lemonade, and gave me some other drink. Maybe with cherries? It was so sweet, I only took a couple of sips and stuck with water. He didn't even ask why I didn't drink the beverage. It seems like that would be a natural response. Hmm."}
{"text":"We loved it ! Our server Cassie was amazing she knew the menu and she was amazing...she offered us wine samples so that was a plus .... first time trying their pizzas and it was so thin n so much flavor ,the salad was good as well .!!! But the staff was just so sweet so on top of things very friendly ....deff going back !!!"}
{"text":"Never had been here before. I got a coupon for a free pizza or $19 off for my birthday and it gave me two wks to use it!!!  The pizza was huge and was so so good.  All we had to end up paying for were our drinks. It was large enough for both my boyfriend and I and we even had some left to take home.  And the atmosphere was very nice as well. Good food, nice place ( clean and nice decor), good waiter, and large portions."}
{"text":"There is no doubt that this is very good pizza, but you can't put it into the category of real foldable New York style pizza. Coal ovens might have been the thing back in the early days and they are experiencing a bit of a renaissance with Grimaldi's and others, but modern NY pizza comes out of normal ovens, has oregano already on the slice, has that droopy tip and also that small layer of grease drips onto your paper plate. That being said, GRimaldi's is one of the best gourmet pizza's in town and I guess the country now. At $20 a pizza that's the category it belongs in, but the staff is very friendly and the large meatball pie I consumed at the bar was hot, fresh and excellent. I hope when this place has 80 restaurants the quality will remain the same. It's sad to see another good place turn into a monster chain, but greed rules these days and this joint could turn into a Chili's of Pizza someday - I hope not."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place with great pizza. The pizza is still pretty good but the service is awful. After waiting over 45 minutes for a table, after being told 20-30 minutes, We were finally seated. Orders were taken and the wait began. They apparently forgot to make our pizza and followed this up with remaking it and delivering it to the wrong table. Management didn't really seem to care one way or another. It's a shame, used to be a good place."}
{"text":"Service was spot on, food was killer, and the overall vibe was super nice. I'd go again, and again."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last week or so and it's hands down the best pizza in Phoenix! No comparison. The salads are also delicious; I like the spinach salad the best. Did you know that if you join their club for your birthday they give you a coupon for a free large pizza? And they also gave me a dessert to take home--total value about $25.00. Amazing. Of course, we are there 10 x per year. It pays to be a good customer there."}
{"text":"Came for a pizza mid-afternoon, service was so-so.. The waitress offered us all the credentials but didn't have a recommendation. When eating the pizza it was decent as well but nothing extravagant. I thought because it was in the quarter it would have been better. The waitress didn't check on us or ask us about how the food was and neither did the manager. All in all, I liked the ambiance but wish it would have been better food and better service. I'm not opposed to going back but it definitely won't be for a while.."}
{"text":"Good pizza! If you like thin crust come here. Do both sauces, white and red, but make sure you tell them to just do chunks of the red, not a full layer, then you'll taste the garlic part of the white pizza more! I know, I'm pretty picky about how my pizza is sauced, haha, but really, this was the best combo.. I don't think I would have liked it as much with only one sauce. All the ingredients tasted fresh, and for $2 per topping they better be fresh!!  Oreo Cheesecake (3.5 stars): Oreo is always amazing, but I liked the strawberry better.   Strawberry Cheesecake (4 stars): You could really taste fresh strawberry flavor.  Tiramisu (3 stars): I'd stick to the cheesecakes.   SERVICE (4 stars)  Our server was really nice but it took her a while to come check up on us and pick up the credit card. They get busy. Pizza takes a while to come out too. I asked if we could order our pizza so by the time we sat down it would be ready, but they wouldn't let us!  ATMOSPHERE (4 stars): In the Palazzo where the shops are, so it's nice to walk around, but their beeper doesn't have a wide range so you can't go far at all."}
{"text":"Have frequented Grimaldi's for years at AZ locations. Tried this location which is close to home with visiting family and found the red pizzas are too dry-hardly any sauce! We ordered a marinara pizza, anchovy, garlic and no cheese-our standby choice for years, but it came out w/minimal sauce and dry. We asked for extra sauce but by time it came pizza was cold and hard. Spoke to manager about our past experiences of ordering this pizza and them laying the sauce down first over entire area vs a few dollops if sauce in too - and his response \"this is how we do it and have always done it\". So obviously our past experience over being long time customers was discounted and disregarded. Well we don't like \"how you do it\" and won't be back based on this manager's \"could care less\" attitude. Settobello it is!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night and were enthusiastic upon entering the restaurant after hearing and reading all the hype about this chain.  But, what a major disappointment.    We ordered a large pizza with sausage and mushrooms.  Grimaldi's is very proud of their pies with a $16.00 sticker price on a basic large cheese.  Toppings are $2.00 each.  So with $20.00 invested in the pie we were hoping for a really good taste.    We like our pizza a little extra crispy and ordered it that way but it came out chewy like a piece of jerky.  Upon inspection - I pulled the cheese and topping layer off the crust - we saw a gummy crust that looked like a glazed donut. A total turn-off.    Also, the sauce was tasteless and the cook skimped on the toppings.  I've eaten a gazillion pizzas in my day and this pie gets a letter grade of an F.    For starters we tried the house salad and at best, it was very average.  The ingredients weren't chopped/prepared professionally and the dressing was bland.    We mentioned our disappointment to our waitress and she had the manager come over to speak to us.  We pointed out the gummy undone crust and he took 50% off the pizza and said he hoped we'd give his store another try.  But nothing turns me off more than unjustified hype, and Grimaldi's gets way too much credit for basically no reason.    I think I'll stick with Oregano's....or heck, even Peter Piper has way better pizza."}
{"text":"I love pizza.  Grimaldi makes pizza for pizza lovers.  It would be too trite to say that their pizza is \"perfect\", but honestly, I have nothing to pick upon.  This was my second foray to Grimaldi's; I had to come back on a return trip to Vegas.  I stopped in late, 10 PM, and the place was sparsely populated.  I had a quick seating by a warm host and got down to business.  I ordered a 12\" traditional with pepperoni and ham.  When delivered, the pie was the right balance of everything.  A thin, chewy but satisfyingly crisp crust.  Slightly sweet and slightly salty sauce.  Meats that were not overly salty themselves (a common issue) and unusually small 1\" pepperoni rounds that managed not to emit excess grease.  The cheese was sublime, providing great texture and foundation without getting in the way.  Cooked expertly with some char, but not too much. Wow!  I found myself deliberately slowing down to enjoy each bite, putting away my cellphone for the meal and grabbing my sidecar Sam Adams for the journey. It was every bit as good as I remembered from a few years ago and I hope I can revisit the experience sooner next time."}
{"text":"Came in last Friday have been coming for years. Rating two stars because when coming out of the bathroom I saw the manger verbally assaulting a waitress for messing up an order. Very unprofessional for a manager. Pizza is fantastic though, not many companies can cook a thin crust crispy without burning it!  Our waiter we had was great even though it was busy, this place can get pretty packed on weekends. I recommend for the pizza and service, never let us down."}
{"text":"Our family loves pizza, some of us Chicago style but me, thin crust so always in the search for a great thin crust pizza. The day we were in Las Vegas happened to be our 9 year olds bday and he wanted pizza. I know there are other probably better pizza places in town but we happened to be in the Fashion mall where he found his bday legos couple stores down in the Lego Store so we popped in here to try out Grimaldi's. I know it's a chain restaurant but we don't have it in town.  First off its not a huge place. Its opened so you can see out and right in front is where they periodically do fashion shows so if you sit outside you get up see that if you don't mind the blaring music and singing for a bit. Inside it's nice and cozy with leather booths against the huge mirror.  We got seated, had a nice waiter yet a bit gruff but I can tell he's just busy and trying to attend to us all. We misheard him while ordering and he was a bit shocked we thought he put down the wrong order. It got a bit uncomfty for awhile lol. It was our first time so it would be nice to have some more patience with us bc yes we were indecisive bc the pizzas all looked so good but our kids had so much opinions :/ so we finally settled on 2 large make your own pizzas but realized we could have gotten a better deal going with a fully loaded specialty one but when I went up to ask if he put in the order he already did. That's ok totally our bad. Wish we had more time to look and decide. Just felt a bit rushed n not sure why.  Anyways the pizza was delicious, perfect thinness. They cut n serve for you. They also graciously gave the bday boy a bday cannoli :) sweet of them.  All in all, not bad. Just a bit odd an experience with the service. Pizza was great. Price ok not the cheapest but ok for a mall restaurant in LV. We were content and just right, not full full. Had fun so thank you!"}
{"text":"Don't leave town without trying this pizza!!!! We are only here for a week and wanted a great pizza. Not big chain cardboard crust! We kept passing Grimaldi's on S. Eastern all day and decided to give them a try. We were blown away with this pizza! Great thin crust, crispy and light! We ordered a small salad and small pie and we couldn't finish it all! We got exactly what we wanted, great fresh pizza!  It's a cozy establishment that does what it does to perfection!"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the West Coast. Always great food, however the service can be a bit inconsistent. Seriously though, who goes to a restaurant for the service?"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! So light and crispy with fresh ingredients! The Caesar salad was fantastic as well! Best pizza I've had in a while!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in here for a date night; it was our first time in. We could not have asked for better service, from the hostess to the server to the S.A. The pizza was excellent, the salad was fresh, and the cannoli was outstanding! We will definitely be back. This is the best pizza that I found in the area so far."}
{"text":"We ordered take out.... walked about an hour to get there only to be told there oven needs to be restarted or something.  No warning n walked away disappointed with Sbarro pizza being better."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot for pizza while we're visiting Las Vegas. The decor, food, and service are all amazing and we always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza I've ever had! Everything is yummy. I love the salads and wine too... I love the atmosphere too! Last Friday night they were so sweet to accommodate a party of 24 for my daughter's 9th birthday. We had such a great time!!"}
{"text":"Well.  I tried this location and Grimaldi's for the first time tonight based on referrals from a friend and other positive comments online.  It sounded like it would be amazing!  I received a birthday coupon for a free 18 inch with one topping so thought this would be a great time to try it out.   First I will say that the service was phenomenal (hence the second star)!  Our server was prompt and courteous, although I did feel a little rushed by her.  The staff appeared genuine and were very helpful being it was our first time there. The food.  Hmm.  We ordered a house salad to share, as we were told it was a good portion for two.  It was actually a portion for at least three.  There were only two olives in the salad, the lettuce was cut in very small pieces.  We added on chicken and mozzarella.  The portions added into the salad were so small that we wondered why we had to pay extra for them!   The pizza.  Wow!  The crust was much thinner than I had expected.  I actually liked the texture of the dough but it had a funny taste to it.  I could not pin point it.  On the way home I realized it almost tasted like a poison.  Something I had never experienced.  I also realized there was no oregano on the pizza.  Something I am used to with two of their competitors in town: Anthony and Mario's Broadway Pizza on Charleston and Metro Pizza.   Cheeeeeese!  Why was there no cheese on our pizza?  Okay there was SOME....but ....not in every bite!  Where there was no cheese there was the topping.   I really am disappointed.  I was expecting a much better experience.  I was excited about trying it and feel really let down.  This is one place that had a once in a lifetime chance with me.  How do you screw up pizza?  Well, they succeeded.  I will remain loyal to Anthony and Mario's Broadway Pizzeria and to Metro Pizza in this town.  If I'm going to eat all these calories, I want it to be worth it!  Thanks for the free pizza Grimaldi that cost us $31 with the salad, extras and two iced teas that were actually glasses of ice with a little tea for topping.  Just not worth it."}
{"text":"A big group of friends came here after a long day of drinking for a bachelor party.  I was amazed that most of us were still standing and that we found this place hidden in a mall in Las Vegas.  The food here was good and the pizza was tasty.  We got a couple of pizzas and both had really good flavor and the crust was good too."}
{"text":"Simply stated--the pizza is amazing.  Great crust, fresh generous toppings, and served piping hot.  The service is friendly and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"A New Jersey icon, best to leave nothing on the pizza since it's so good."}
{"text":"i like Grimaldi's pzza--the crust is always done right and holds up to the toppings--prices are reasonable--my only suggestion is that sometimes the service is too much service.  we got there and my friends had just sat down--jackets and purses weren't even settled yet and the waiter was hovering.  I like good service as much as the next person but sometimes you need a do not disturb sign at the table--so you can have a little time to enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"Dirty, noisy, too bright, like McDonalds only worse.  Not a date place for sure."}
{"text":"Great expeirience eating here for the first time!! Enjoyed a great Pie with a buddy of mine, who also agrees that this place is high quality Pizza!! Different and great tasting at the same time. I'll be going back here soon!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with the pizza here... Had heard rave reviews about the place and finally tried it. Better than OK,  pretty good, just didn't live up to the hype for me. I'd go here again though, just wouldn't go way out my way!"}
{"text":"Automatically lose a star for no Ranch.  You serve pizza and salads--where's the Ranch?!?!  I have been here multiple times for dine in and take out.  Everyone is friendly.  The last few times I have been disappointed with the take out.  This is a thin crust pizza that is best right out of the oven.  I can make it to my house in under 10 minutes and the pizza always loses almost all of the heat and isn't very good by the time I get home.  Since I know it loses the heat I arrive before my pizza is boxed so I am ready to roll asap.  The last pizza to-go was just blah, the onion chunks were as big as my pinkie finger. 3/4 of that pizza went out with the garbage.  I won't be returning here anymore.  Prices for Toppings: I am annoyed with the price they charge ($2-4) for each topping and it's the same price for half.  You want onion on just half it will cost you $2.00...a whole organic onion doesn't even cost $2.00.  I am usually not picky about price if the food is worth it.    Our last dine in visit we were in the back room and the squeaky balloon animal guy drove us completely nuts.  If we wanted a Circus Style Pizza Experience w/ kids climbing all over the place we would go to Chucky Cheese!  Can you say \"BONKERS?\"--We couldn't wait to get out of there!!  They have great iced tea and the salads are all super. A small salad is enough for 2 people but don't expect any Ranch.  They have a great patio for outdoor dining with heaters which is great.   My advice: Dine in for pizza and don't ever get it to go.  You will be disappointed with the to-go temp by the time you get home...even if it's right around the corner."}
{"text":"Love love love Grimaldi's.  They have great, traditional coal fired pizza.  The patio is quiet and large.  AJ waited during my most recent visit and he couldn't have been a better server!  Very attentive and helpful!  I eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"Cashed in the annual free birthday pizza coupon during a recent lunch at the empty bar. Some people were dining outside and everytime the door opened, a fly or two would make its way inside. This place needs to put some kind of roof over their patio, who is going to sit out there the next 5 months? The pizza was better in the Las Vegas area Grimaldi's. The crust was way thinner than usual and the pie had no real pizza taste or anything going on. It actually arrived at the table not very hot either. I did save $20 by using the coupon, so little to quibble with, but the pizza should be uniform now all over since this place is just another chain now and an overpriced one at that."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The pizza is good but not by any means spectacular. If you sign up on their website you get a coupon for a free 1 topping 18 inch pizza.  We had a meatball pizza which was pretty good. We also ordered the house salad which is romaine lettuce,  mushrooms,  roasted peppers, tomatoes, red onions and olives in a italian dressing.  The small salad is enough for two people.  Our server was friendly and checked up on us often. I will say this i ordered a water and i know most water comes from the tap but i could really taste it in the water.  If you're doing some shopping at the San Tan this is a good place to grab a bite."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale AZ decided to stop by an grab a pizza....wine.  This place is simply Amazing. Customer service was A-1, friendly atmosphere with a down to earth social crowd.  Excellent place to stop in for a bite to eat after enjoying a nice stroll along the Scottsdale Strip."}
{"text":"This is usually my treat on a diet cheat day. Pretty consistent, for the number of times we ordered pizza there only once or twice it wasn't good. Good service, clean place. No complains. Although I feel it was little bit better maintained when we first moved here, about 5 years ago. Now it's sometimes empty and depressing to sit there, it used to be more alive before. But - still- great for a take out night."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! Great food, great service and great location! We love going to this location, love dc ranch! Also love the new location at scottsdale quarter!! I wanna say its my fav restaurant actually!!! A++++++"}
{"text":"cool location in the Mall.  Pizza is good.  But what I definitely didn't like was some guy in a button shirt and dirty slacks, I think he is the manager, anyway he would bring the food out to the tables, pick up trash, make drinks at the bar, greet customers, etc.  I prefer the server to handle my food not the guy with the \"hairy\" arms and his thumb touching my pizza!  managers in button down shirts and slacks should not handle my food!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's isn't your typical chain pizza place, but it's not outstanding either. The service at this location was excellent.  The wine choices are great. I use an app to check customer reviews for wine to make sure I'm not buying swill when I pick up a bottle.  I noticed several of the wines at Grimaldi's that I had purchased before, all of them highly rated.    But the pizza. Idk.  It's good.  The toppings are good.  The sauce is good.  The crust is that thin crust, and theirs just isn't all that great to me.  I suppose that's it.  The crust.  I'm not a huge fan of that cracker crust. Or maybe I just wish theirs had more flavor because I have certainly enjoyed thin crust pizzas before.  I recalled being a bigger fan of Grimaldi's in the past.  It's kinda hard actually to articulate why Grimaldi's doesn't get 5-stars.  I think of other places that I've given 5-stars and Grimaldi's just doesn't wow me in anyway.  Everything is good, but nothing stands out.  I guess that's it.   My suggestion:  if you like thin crust pizza, then you can't go wrong with Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. The server recommended just the right stuff. The salami Caesar salad is a great starter and the Don's pizza is delicious. A little tip, don't fill up on salad."}
{"text":"I personally think it was okay.  Before entry, I was  excited for their pizza because my friends had it in New York. They said it was amazing. We ordered the Don.  The pizza arrived and I took pictures of it like i do with every food. First bite of the pizza was ehh, warm not hot, crispy not succulent. All in all, it was okay. It wasn't extraordinary or amazing in my book. Even my  friends who tried the one in New York said there were something missing."}
{"text":"Grimaldis is just damn good. Very good pizza, warm cozy environment, and good service. I hear they have salads and other non-pizza options but I dunno because pizza.   They also do an awesome job of take-out at night. You can call ahead and then pull up to the west curb and they will come out and bring you your pizza! That's correct - you do not need to leave the comfy confines of your car. Jah Bless!  Pro-tip. Try the pepperoni and sausage pizza- it's super good."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but I called in today and asked if they took reservations. The girl who answered the phone said, \"Yes we do.\"  So I told her we would need one for 5:00. She responded, \"Oh I am sorry, that's technically a call-ahead and we're not allowed to do that.\" Okay...could have been worded better. I totally understand, but don't make the customer feel like they are doing something wrong. So I responded with the usual...okay thank you anyways.  She responded with a snarky, \"bye!\" Then hung up the phone. Sorry, but where I come from...those are horrible phone manners.  You never hang up on the customer. Not sure we will be visiting tonight."}
{"text":"There is perhaps nothing more stressful than being forced to choose the restaurant to eat at for an evening. Grimaldi's had just come into my mind because i knew it was nearby and that i've been there a couple previous times and didn't hate it. My parents and i had returned from my award ceremony and we were planning on meeting my sister for dinner at the restaurant. Well surprise, surprise, she ended up being over an HOUR late. I was really embarrassed of what our waiter would think.. But he displayed no signs of judgement. I don't believe i ever got his name but he was bald and had glasses. Anyway, my initial reaction to the restaurant and the atmosphere was not an entirely positive one.. Although most of the busboys were incredibly attractive, it was always chilly, and my ice cold lemonade that i always order did not help! Also, the tables were a bit uncomfortably close together. I had the misfortune to being seated within 3 feet of a baby. The baby wasn't loud or fussy or anything, i just genuinely felt a discomfort with its presence to be honest. When it comes to the food, it was satisfactory. I ordered a personal calzone (12 inches) with pepperoni, green peppers, and mushrooms. It was pretty good but i would be lying if i said i didn't agree with Leslie Knope when she states that \"calzones are just harder to eat pizzas\" i ended up have more of the incredible thin crust pizza my parents ordered..:-/ When my sister finally arrived... an hr late.... My parents and i had already finished eating with MORE than enough leftovers for her. It was at that time that i decided to treat myself with a Simoa© cookie cheesecake. It was epic. The two-stall bathrooms were also very nice and clean, plus it was cool because no one else was in there so i got to look at my butt in the mirror with NO hesitation.. Which was nice. When it all comes down to it.. I gave Grimaldi's a three. I will most likely be returning but not anytime soon i hope. I think another downside i forgot to mention was when my dad made me carry the leftover box on our way out but thats unrelated and isn't the restaurants fault."}
{"text":"Excellent Service. ASK FOR MEAGAN!!! The pizza was great. I recommend the Caesar salad with salami and mozzarella. We had The Don pizza and it was awesome."}
{"text":"I love this pizza !! But last time. The waitress wasn't take our Order more than 20min.. Even she don't bring any water ..It was disappoint us... But we love still this Pizza"}
{"text":"After living in Italy for 4 years I have been on the hunt for good pizza. The pizza here is pretty close to the real thing. It had a nice thin crust and good toppings. The service was good, and the place looked really nice. I will go back again. The only thing I could say is the pizza needed to be just a little bit bigger."}
{"text":"Coming from CA, we were told NOT to miss Grimaldi's!!! So glad we came! It's NY style thin, which I am not usually a fan of, but this was fantastic! We got a White pizza, 1/2 with ricotta and 1/2 with sausage. Delicious! We also got a red sauce pizza, 1/2 and 1/2 again. Their special The Don, and the other half Brooklyn Bridge. Sooo good! I made a mistake of getting sangria to start with so I got full too soon! But it was good as well!"}
{"text":"TL:DR - Food Poisoning  So on a recent business trip to Las Vegas I visited this restaurant twice. First time was on a Thursday night and the restaurant was extremely slow.  Only 3 tables in use in the restaurant.  It took over an hour to get one pizza and we never had a chance to order more drinks because nobody ever came to check on us.  When I asked about our order the manager apologized and the pizza was out in 10 minutes.... About the time it takes to make and bake a pizza. Still didn't see out waiter until he dropped the check at the end without so much as an apology. The pizza was amazing. The best pizza and worst service I have ever had.   I went back about a week later on my last night in vegas with a coworker. I explained my previous experience with the service and this time was much better.  The next morning I woke up to head to the airport for my flight and the tell tale signs of food poisoning reared their ugly head. Flying with food poisoning is one of the worst experiences I have ever had.  I am 100% sure of the source of the food poisoning as I only ate one thing on that day... Grimaldis pizza with a caprese salad. The salad is likely to be the culprit but to have two horrible experiences in a 2 week time period is inexcusable. I suggest avoiding this spot at all costs."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but the pizza was good. We were there during a very busy time, and the level of service we received was a direct reflection of that. They checked for refills a few times, but that was about it. I was also a little disappointed that they pepperoni they used was pre-packaged (Hormel). A place like this should at least use meats and products that are a little finer in quality. All things aside, the pizza was good, but not craveable."}
{"text":"Love!! The whole menu is great but I will high light a few of my favorites. The pizza, literally the best pizza I have ever had! Not only is the pizza  delicious but it is consist every visit. The passion fruit tea is amazing, so full of flavor but not fake flavor and it is unsweetened.  The NY cheese cake is so creamy, rich and perfect!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We dropped by for a late lunch and sat at the bar. You choose what size pizza you want, then the sauce and the last the toppings.  We got two personal pizzas, one with their tomato sauce and pepperoni and mushrooms and another one with pesto sauce and grilled chicken and mushrooms. The tomato sauce pizza was very good, much better than the pesto sauce pizza.  The tomato sauce was tasty with the herbs and spices they use.  The pesto sauce was decent.  The personal size pizza was very generous in size and I only ate 1/2 of it.  We also got a house salad which was your typical salad.    Our server was the bartender whose name I think was Todd.  He explained the menu to us as this was our first time. He was very helpful and personable."}
{"text":"Another pizza chain claiming to be the best from NY. Grimaldis is located across from the Harkins at Park West. The inside always smells like dough and bleach for some reason. The staff is always rude and very short with replies. I went recently with my wife and another couple. They sat us in the very back in an alley like room even though the place was more than half empty. The waitress came out and asked for our drinks. Not friendly or if she was happy to see us. The menu consists of about half a dozen items. No wings or appetizers. Just build your own pizza and some salads.   I ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, jalapenos, and mushrooms. I also ordered a large Mediterranean salad. Asked for ranch and the waitress arrogantly replied they don't carry ranch. So I asked for blue cheese and again she smirks that they don't carry dressings. I said, \"Oh, okay thanks.\"  Point taken: I am beneath your level of standards.  Thanks.  The salad was okay. Everything tasted fresh but had a little too much of their balsamic vinegar dressing. And for 10 bucks I could have made a salad that would have stomped a mud hole in that one.   The pizza was a pretty decent size. The edges were slightly burnt and the cheese and sauce were on point. However, for 2 dollars per topping I expect more than 8 slices of jalapeno, 10 slivers of mushrooms, and the tiniest circles of pepperoni that I have ever seen. Not to mention the jalapenos had the ends on them. Yum, that tastes great chewing on jalapeno stems. Thanks Grimaldis!   Then the manager comes by and cant even make eye contact and asks how we are doing. Great thanks. We wont come back here.   The bill comes out to 40+ bucks before tip. For a pizza, salad, and a couple of drinks. Do yourself a favor. Go somewhere that appreciates your business and welcomes you in their restaurant at bare minimum. If you want to drop 40 bucks on a pizza and salad go to Piazza AL Forna, Bianco, La Grande, Spinatos, Oreganos, Cibo...etc...etc...etc."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for my birthday. There were not too many people here and we got served right away, the service was amazing Jodi Took care of us and was very sweet and pleasant. We got the ATM which one topping pepperoni pizza and another separate pizza with meatballs because we had somebody who has a dairy allergy so we left out the cheese. As usual the pizza was amazing this is a tradition and I always come to Grimaldi's for my birthday."}
{"text":"I just love this place! I've always come in the evening time. The atmosphere is perfect.  It's dimly lit so there is no harsh lighting disturbing you while you eat, and even though it is always packed inside, it's always been nice and private and you can comfortably have a conversation. I usually go for dinner with friends but this time I called in for that special they are running on Monday's for the month of October for a $10 16\" cheese pizza. Wow what a fantastic deal! I called ahead of time and spoke with Colten. He was very nice and took my order. When I arrived, my order was ready to go and I was in and out in about 5 minutes. I could only eat one piece, and froze the rest. I'll now have yummy pizza to hold me over till next Monday :)"}
{"text":"Today I ordered a sausage and olive pizza and the Mediterranean salad.  I have to say that the pizza was the best I've had in a long long time.  Your sauce is amazing... great rich flavor and not too oily and not too sweet.  So thank you Grimaldi's, you remind me of home!!!   The salad was full of fresh ripe veggies and the dressing was oh so good.  You had the right amount of everything, where I was able to taste feta, cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, kalamata olives and onions in every bite.      And as an added bonus the person who answered the phone was extremely polite and professional.  I believe he was the bartender.  My only suggestion would be to actually use kalamata olives as your menu advertised.  You used the cheaper version, black olives which were fine but I was expecting kalamata olives."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered \"The Don\" with mushrooms and olives... Unfortunately the pizza was dropped when they pulled it out of the oven, but the manager was kind enough to come out.. explain, apologize and take it off the bill. The pizza was amazing and the customer service made it worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Not a lot of good choices for neighborhood suburb pizza in Vegas, but Grimaldi's fits the bill.   We often stop for lunch while in town.    We started out our meal with a Caesar salad.  Fresh greens, crunchy croutons and tasty dressing.  Nothing particularly special, but overall a decent salad to whet your appetite.   This particular visit, I decided to try the gluten free crust.  Wasn't sure what to expect, but wanted to give it a try.   Surprisingly good!   Crust was crisp and didn't leave you full with an over-engorged feeling eating carbs.  Be sure to ask for the pizza to be cooked crisp, that way you get a slice you can actually pick up and eat with your hands.   Fresh mozzarella and basil were the toppings I chose. Simplistic.  A light way to enjoy pizza.    We finished the meal with Tiramisu.  Good espresso flavor and light cream taste.  We shared and enjoyed the dessert.    Grimaldi's is a great place to enjoy pizza on a date or with the family.  Lots of menu options to please all.   Attentive service and rustic atmosphere.  Eating out on their outside patio is a nice treat.  We'll visit again next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The only reason I will give this place four stars is because of the pricing. I believe it's a little over the top like you should at least be given two toppings with your pizza and then a additional charge for the rest, but that's just me. Anyways as far as the taste and service as received I can't complain."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch.  A cute restaurant with black straws (the nicer the eatery the more likely they are to use black straws).  We were quickly seated, drinks arrived quickly.  I was shocked that the menu offered only salads, pizza, calzone, and a couple dessert options.  No appetizers, no pasta.   I always like to see what other customers are eating.  Most had salads, and all looked delicious.  We had the antipasto which was alright.  Rather bland with the exception of the kalamata olives.  Everyone was eating pizza.  All looked good and greasy.  We had a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms.  The cheese was good, and the sauce was real sauce!  My dad said, \"This pepperoni is some serious meat!\" And my mother had heartburn in the first 5 minutes.    Even though there was more than enough staff, our drinks sat empty for quite awhile.  Our table exchanged \"where'd the waiter go?\" glances and a manager must have had radar for this.  She immediately appeared at our table and refilled our drinks, boxed our pizza, brought our check and ran the credit card.  I give that lady 5 stars.  On the funny side- there was a girl \"working\" (could never tell what she was actually doing) who looked like a younger version of Tabitha from Tabitha's Takeover (show on Bravo).    Little things: Restroom was clean!  We sat near the front and heard the telephone ring multiple times.  The brick pizza oven is in the middle of the restaurant and you can watch the guys toss pizzas.  I wouldn't avoid the place in the future, but I won't go out of my way to eat there again."}
{"text":"First time coming to this pizzeria I've been hearing about it since moving to Phoenix. Ok the pizza is fantastic! I'm a traditional guy so I ordered a regular cheese pizza. I love a thin crust that isn't too chewy and this is it. When you first bite into it you get that crunch from the toasted crust which is great. Then the flavors of the sauce and cheeses are really good and fresh. I don't live close but when I'm in the area I will definitely have to visit more often. Cuz this is what real NY pizza is about!"}
{"text":"This pizza restaurant was our plan B after our unsuccessful attempt to eat at Carson Kitchen in downtown Las Vegas, unfortunately they were closed for a private party event.  Generally, I dislike going to any restaurant located inside a hotel on the strip because the traffic, parking, and combined walking distance is inconvenient.  The Palazzo is a nice higher end hotel so going here made it a bit more tolerable.  The restaurant itself lets you feel like you are having dinner outside, this was nice.    We ordered the antipasto, spinach salad, and The Don pizza (pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs).  The thin crust pizza is cooked under intense heat for a short time in their brick oven, to me it tastes like your standard Napoli style pizza - they're okay but I don't like the way the crust is always burnt.  If you're a fan of Chicago style pan pizza then this place may not be for you.  My wife on the other hand just loved it and said it was the best pizza she ever had.  It was good - tangy tomato sauce, melted cheese, and that slightly salted meat taste hit the spot.  We also enjoyed the spinach salad because it came with other healthy stuff like crispy bacon and Gorgonzola cheese.   The antipasto was good as well - hard to go wrong with cold cuts, sliced cheese, olives, and jarred red peppers on a plate.  This paired well with their bread, olive oil, and vinegar for dipping.  I later learned that this restaurant is available in 5 other locations, we'll be sure to bookmark the locations off the strip the next time we are in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you haven't already, go to the Grimaldi's website and sign up for their email club- each year, you'll get a free large pizza on your birthday, $19 value. It's one of my favorite deals.  Menu has a couple of salads (I prefer the Mediterranean) and apps, and you build your own pizza- pick a size and a sauce, then add on your toppings. So far, I've only had the red sauce but I like that they have a pesto available. The large pizza is enormous and their suggestion that it feeds 3-4 people is accurate. Something about the crust and sauce just didn't do it for me- it's good but not great, something was missing and we added a lot of the garlic. While I'm a fan and will come back, the pricing keeps me from returning regularly- it's pretty steep and considering the $3-5 per topping fee, they were pretty light.   Heads up, their pizza oven is unavailable at certain times- they have a \"stoking hour\" (4-6PM?) to reset the oven and pies are delayed, but there are drink and app discounts."}
{"text":"Came in to grab a pizza to take down to the brewery down the street. Service was good from the guy who took my order, even if it did a min at first as they were pretty busy for a Wed night. Glad I stopped in tho bc the pizza was exceptional. Sauce, crust, amt of toppings, everything was on point."}
{"text":"Just thinking about this pizza makes me salivate.  The crust is crispy yet chewy, the toppings are of the highest caliber, and the cheese is so gooey good.   I wouldn't order the pesto and red pepper pizza - it wasn't our favorite.  This is as close as you're going to get to NY style pizza in Vegas."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Grimaldis, although the first was at the original restaurant in Brooklyn, New York-which was the best pizza I've ever had!  This comes a very close second to The Brooklyn branch-I'd say possibly the atmosphere and the area where the restaurant is located in Vegas isn't as good as New York and so this affects the meal itself-however the pizza was gorgeous and we had to order more pizza as we went along, we had 3 18inch pizzas between 6 of us in the end lol   The prices were reasonable and the wine was lovely! The service was a bit slow but the food was worth it in the end.  I would highly recommend trying Grimaldis if you ever find yourself in Brooklyn, and if in Vegas this is with a whirl as well!"}
{"text":"I liked my pizza... but I really didn't care for the $2-$3 for each topping!! Expensive pizza!! I went for the location in Henderson - I wish I had gone to Verrazanos  And the waitress forgot the overpriced salad. But they have a very extensive wine/drink selection.... I guess to help wash down the $$$! Pizza. I think there were more drink selections than pizza selections. Next time somewhere else"}
{"text":"We love this place and so does our daughter! So when we asked her where she wanted to celebrate her birthday she asked for Grimaldi's! Unfortunately, when I asked the hostess, Alyssa about any birthday celebrations, she responded (rather short and rudely) that they didn't do anything at all. Super disappointing for such a fantastic family-friendly restaurant. Even if the location doesn't do any type of celebration, she didn't offer any type of alternatives like \"we have a great dessert, maybe you guys can sing?\" or \"who's celebrating their birthday?\" I just expected something more with such an awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"I love this place. I get take out a few times a month since I work close. They have great pizza, great salads, and the bartenders are super awesome. The pizza is a little pricy but totally worth it. 5 stars."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since the days they opened the doors in their first AZ place in Old Town Scottsdale. Best pizza west of the Mississippi. One complaint: I'd like to see them bring back the cucumber salad (Fulton Street, I think it was called). The salad choices are OK, but not great."}
{"text":"Local friends highly recommended us this place and it did not disappoint! Delicious pizza, savory bread while you wait . Service was very quick  and the waiter was always so kind checking on us every so often.  I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I like this pizza a lot.  Make no mistake it is not a Chicago styyle deep dish.  It is thinn crust - with top notch toppings.  The place is usually a bit crowded and I am not crazy about the atmosphere - tables are a bit tight on top of one another and the bar is pretty pedestrian - though fine.  This is my favorite food choice in the San Tan Village center.  I like all of their pizza combos and think they are all worth trying.  I wish they had a kids menu - that would be helpful for the little ones.  I also wish they had a few more apparizer and salad choices - but what they have is good.   I like the pizze enough for a higher rating - but I would say that it is a bit expensive.  Because the pizza is thin a large can be eaten by two or three people eaisly (i can eat half of one myself without pushing it) it ends up being a bit pricy.  All-in-all a good place and worth your time if you like a thinner, floppy pizza with high quality toppings."}
{"text":"Wowza!!! This place is amazing...The pizza is super delish. Husband and I shared a small pizza with two toppings. $18 bucks. And we still had two slices left. A small is more like a medium. I am excited they opened one in Los Angeles. I found my new pizza joint :)"}
{"text":"First let me say we've eaten at this location many times over the years and the pizza is always amazing!  The service is hit or miss however. Tonight is 5/25/18 and apparently it's Graduation night for many young people. We arrived about 9 pm and waited at the front while a super young looking hostess spoke to a woman in line in front of us in a barely audible voice, ignored me and then took a huge party of maybe 12 guests to the back.  Then she came back, ignored me again while she mumbled something to the other woman and her date and took them to their seats. She finally came over and quietly said something (I'm not sure what, but I THINK she was asking how many of us there were?) to us then disappeared again. After a couple more minutes, a waitress came over and asked if we had been helped. She had bright red hair and was very sweet. She's the one who explained why it was so hectic tonight etc.  She arranged for us to be seated right near the brick oven area as the young hostess finally returned with menus. Once seated, a different waitress came over to take our orders. The water came out (without the lemon I had ordered) and the salad came out super quick, but not with the dressing on the side as i had asked.  We chalked it up to the kitchen being so busy that they didn't read order details.  Our server was very attentive and the food was great. We were prepared to give her a great tip of $12 on our AFTER tax total of $56.29...but then she did something so many servers in Vegas have done that almost erased all of the amazing service she had provided. We needed change for our bill (should've been $3.71), and when she came back, she had cheated us on the 71 cents.   I understand that it is a small amount but if you think how many times she may have taken people's change without getting their permission, she may be stealing an extra $20+ from people per shift!  And the point is not the extra money she may be making off this little trick, the point is that nobody has the right to keep MY money without my permission!  And like i said, MANY servers have done this to us, but only in Vegas. My hubby & I had vowed to reduce the tip by 50-100% when servers do this to us, but we were conflicted because this one had done such a great job earlier, plus we were in an intense conversation while we were dealing with the bill.  She accidentally ended up with a nearly $10 tip which I feel is way too much for someone who assumes it's ok to keep YOUR change. We should have given her just the $3 she gave us as change to make our point that it's not ok to steal from your customers.  TO SERVERS:  If you are too lazy to carry or make coin change for your customers, then cheat YOURSELF and give the customers the option to give the difference back to you and then some.  If you are an amazing server, you shouldn't have a problem.   I'm not stating our server's name because I don't want her to get in trouble but I hope the whole staff reads this so my message gets out. And that (rude, unclear hostess; drinks and appetizer coming out incorrectly; and server cheating us out of our change) once again continues my string of so-so service at this Grimaldi's.  The reasons for hit or miss service we have gotten here are not always the same, but it seems to be a consistent theme."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place, I eat here several times per year usually and almost always get the same thing, I absolutely love their white pizza and I add pepperoni, it's the most amazing thing in the world and it blows most other pizza places out of the water. It's super thin , crusty Pizza that has a lot of cheese and is garlicky. The pepperonis are these miniature little pepperonis that curl up and are so delicious. I always order a large pizza so I have plenty of leftovers. Also they have the best birthday program in town, anyone that signs up will get sent a free voucher for a large pizza around their birthday week. No other purchase required, it's a crazy good deal. I've also tried their barbecue chicken pizza which is seasonal and it's amazing, also their red pizza is delicious as well, probably the best red pizza sauce I've ever had. They don't have many appetizers other than salads but that's okay I'm there for the pizza. I have shared a salad a few times and they have been very good. They also have some amazing cheesecakes for dessert which we usually end up taking home. Every time my parents come to town there is always a trip to Grimaldi's involved. It's also close to a lot of the spring training games and Tommy Lasorda frequents it, I'm told during spring training he is often there a few times a week, I have seen him twice personally myself, he was always very kind and more than willing to take a picture with people."}
{"text":"The staff here was super nice and patient with us.  Got the Don and Cesar Salad.  Really hit the spot.  Doesn't taste exactly like NY but it's as close as you're going to get,"}
{"text":"Excellent thin-crust pizza, the three of us each ordered our own personal sized margarita pizza with our own choice of toppings which were large enough to have left overs. Great atmosphere for a party or friendly social gathering. We loved the checkered tablecloths!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here about every six weeks or so. We love the pepperoni and Jalapeño as well as the white pizza with crumbled sausage or turkey on it. Sometimes we add ricotta. We were a little bummed with our most recent visit to find out they no longer have a fully stocked bar. Beer and wine only. The selection of beer and wine is okay. The service is always on point. We found the best way to enjoy the pizza is asking the server to have the cook's leave the pizza in the oven for a little extra time. This way the crust stays from becoming soggy so quickly. Over the years they have added a few locations. I use to go to the one in DC ranch, now its at the Scottsdale quarter. Once went to the Glendale location. All in all the service is consistent across all locations. Great place to pop in for a quick pizza. Don't go overboard on toppings as the cost will add up quickly. Bring the full service bar back to the old town location!"}
{"text":"This pizza is impressive: *crunchy slightly bubby crust and still maintains a nice chew, SO important for GREAT pie *whole, fresh ingredients *a personal pan pizza is a HUGE size for 1 person, if you're a gal, I would split *check out the vegetarian toppings, chock full of flavor, loved mine: pesto, jalapeno, garlic, green peppers and black olives *cheese melted perfectly *nice sauce and cheese ratio *water is imported from NYC *open late on Fridays ad Saturdays, till 2AM.    After our late night grub here, I talked about it the remainder of the trip, nonetheless, I have planned to frequent G's on the next visit.  SO lip smacking good.  Hands down the best thin crust NY style pizza on the Strip."}
{"text":"The pizza is always delicious. As a tradition my friend and I come for birthdays because they send a free large pizza coupon if you sign up for their birthday club. We ordered the pepperoni pizza  for my friends birthday. And it was amazing."}
{"text":"From California......best sauce ever. As good as New York pizza. The fresh mozzarella is amazing and so is the caprese and antipasto salads. We came twice in one week before heading home."}
{"text":"This place was great! My new favorite pizza! Prices aren't too high either which is definitely a plus. Great service and atmosphere, a must go place for any pizza lover. Pizza is thin crust \"Brooklyn\" style as they referred to it. The best!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza for even better prices. No wait time for a group of 5 on a Friday night. Staff is very nice, helpful, and dessert is delicious. We had the trio with butterscotch cheesecake and cannolis. All of it was delicious and we had plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"Go to pizza spot to meet friends with our kids. This location is bigger & more spacious, not as cramped as the eastern location. It also has a back room you can book for parties or large groups.   The food is always delicious. Thin brick oven pizza. We always get a red sauce with pepperoni (mini), mushrooms & olives and a pesto with chicken & mushroom. Their Caesar salad is delicious & refreshing, a nice light app before the pizza coma.   This location has changing tables in both the men & women's restrooms which is very convenient for people with little ones. They also give raw pizza dough to kids to play with before the food is served.   They do curb side to go too, so call in your order & pull up to the north side of the building & they run it out.   Tip: don't go on a game day or major sporting event going on, hooters next door is packed & no parking is available."}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner far away from the strip thinking it would be way better overall. I don't know if we were wrong or right but this place surely disappointed us. It started out first with the beer selection. Okay, not a big deal as food is more important but they're out of a beer we chose and they didn't even offer a suggestion. We ordered a large pizza and got two toppings (sausage and mushrooms). I could literally count all the sausage toppings and mushrooms were just as sparse. For a place that charges by the topping, we felt ripped off!  Service wasn't that much better. The table nearby had more food and drinks and could tell they got better service the entire time because of it. Ridiculous for the party of two!  By the time we are almost half the pizza, it became rubbery and impossible to cut with a fork and knife, bleh! We had one slice left over and decided to get it to go. When we tried eating it later that evening it was disgusting! Needless to say we won't be returning to this or any of the other Grimaldi's locations."}
{"text":"Server Andrea was prompt and very sweet. Food was great, tasty bruschetta, salad, and pizza. Sauce is a little too sweet for my taste but the crust was perfection. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Great for an outdoor salad and pizza lunch with wine. Friendly service. Plenty of pizza options."}
{"text":"We come here so much. I'm shocked I haven't left a review yet. It is our absolute favorite family spot. Our two year old loves playing with the pizza dough they give him. Waiters are always super friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. A couple times our pizza was a bit burnt on the bottom and they whipped us up a new one no questions asked. This is our order every time - pepperoni pizza with extra sauce, a small Caesar salad, and a slice of Oreo cheesecake! We love it all - sooo good!!"}
{"text":"Tiz yummy but a bit pricey, we don't go often, I like the fact they have some different toppings than the run of the mill stuff...  I will miss grimaldi' when we move"}
{"text":"What kind of pizza place does not have pineapple or ranch? This place!   Pizza was good but not overly awesome.   Minus 1 star for not having ranch. Minus 1 star for not having pineapple.  Yes it's that serious.  Iittle ceasars  over grimaldis any day."}
{"text":"This place is THE Grimaldi's of New York, the original pizza chef's place.  The original pizza place of New York is Lombardi's, but the pizza chef was actually Grimaldi himself.  When he realized his pizza was the best selling item in Lombardi's Grocery (NOT pizza joint), Grimaldi decided to go on his own and open a pizza place.  The rest is history.    My friend from NY couldn't believe that GIlbert of all places had THE Grimaldi's!  Their pizza is the best you can get in Gilbert hands down.  The reason for 1 less star is due to their slow service during peak hours.  The food's excellent and they have a descent wine menu as well.    The pizza's baked in their coal brick oven, hence the name.  The crust is thin, crispy, and the dough is just the right amount of chewy.  Good mozzarella and all the ingredients are high quality.  If you like spicy, try sausage, pepperoni, and jalapeno on a pesto pizza.   Heavenly!  If you like NY style pizza, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is Grimaldi's prettiest site in the Valley,  abutting a beautiful green park.  We have been coming here for years, and are creatures of habit: a large pepperoni and black olive pie with a nice bottle of Italian red from their very representative and well priced wine list.  The service is attentive and could not be more solicitous.  We have ordered the Caprese salad when it has been crowded and we anticipated a wait for the pie, but nothing memorable there.  The pie is perfect.  The crust, thin, and charred, the pepperoni both sweet and spicy, perfectly complimentary mozzarella and tomato sauce; the black olives a color and taste counterpoint.  Recommended for dessert, any of the fabulous cheesecakes, especially the NY, with a cherry drizzle.  You can wait an hour plus for a table at Bianco; we've found pizza heaven in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing!   I recommend asking the waiter to double cut your slices :)"}
{"text":"Finally.   For the longest, I've search for some really excellent pizza in Vegas, and I'd had almost given up, . . . but then I tried Grimaldi's.  The funny thing is I've probably passed by it a gazillion times, yelped it, and even bookmarked it, but for whatever reason, I didn't get around to trying it (probably because I'm currently searching for the best ayce sushi place).  But now that I have, there is little doubt that Grimaldi's will be my go to pizza spot.   here's the skinny -   - thin crust:  I dig it and they do a pretty good job at it (so much so that I actually ate the crust).    - sauce: pretty close to the sauce I vaguely remember having in NYC (but I'll be the first to admit that's been awhile).   - cheese: I'm not sure what it is exactly what I like about it . . . maybe it was the texture and stretchiness or maybe the balance of milkiness and salt.  whatever.  it's good.   We ordered the Brooklyn Bridge and the Margherita:  The Brooklyn Bridge was a smidge on the sweet side (thanks to the ricotta which I would have probably replaced with either mushrooms, pepperoni, or more sausage) but still pretty tasty.  The Margherita was perfect.  I know that extra sauce and fresh basil may not sound all that mind-blowing but I nearly ate the whole pie.  My only regret was not actually eating there.  It had been a long day (we visited Hoover Dam) and we just wanted to get home, but the place looked very inviting, comfortable, and family friendly.  Next time - and there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"The Pizza was great but the tap beers were warm. I mentioned it to the bar tender and he said they know and they've had the kegerator worked on but that's just how it is...and then kept right on serving piss warm beer. I mentioned it to the manager and he offered to comp the beers but I declined. The pizza was good, but not good enough to hold up a mediocre bar."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! Had some family friends in town and got to try this place out together. Great food good service the Brooklyn bridge is my new favorite!! The drinks were amazing as well the Siena is great!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is some really good pizza, I do believe the brick oven is the key to the flavor. We also love the antipasto salad, all in all it's a great value."}
{"text":"My favorite pizzeria and a great price! Great place to bring the family, everyone here is so great and great atmosphere"}
{"text":"This Grimaldi's is located in the Old Town Scottsdale area so you know it was poppin'! You have to park kind of far and walk a little bit.  We walked in  on a Tuesday night and asked for a table of two. They asked for a minute so we said okay. They never got back to us. I'm pretty sure they forgot about us... And we were hangry. That's cool. No big deal. We just forgot about it and sat at the bar.  The bartender greeted us, got us drinks, and took our food order. He didn't check on us much and he kind of left the bar area a lot so he was kind of hard to reach when we were tying to order more alcohol.   We finished our meal, paid-out, and left. I love Grimaldi's. The food never disappoints. The service was just okay. Wish they didn't forget about us."}
{"text":"Kevin is the best server. He always takes care of me and my family. He's hilarious and very kind. Unfortunately, he doesn't work at this location anymore. I am so sad :( no one else is the same.   LETS TALK FOOD. -Pizza is bomb. I always get the sausage and pepperoni pizza and man the meats are just the right spice! -The small Caesar salad with fresh pepper is BOMB! It is crunchy and fresh :) -The glass of the Educated Guess is bold and smooth and I love it. -The Oreo cheesecake is TO DIE FOR.   If you haven't been to Grimaldi's, get your tooshie there right now."}
{"text":"The old town location is good people and the food is always solid.  I do feel like the pizza isn't as good as the other Grimaldi's   Service is a 4 Ambiance is a 3 the place is always packed  I would say it's trending towards a 4"}
{"text":"Pizza is excellent and worth the price. They do close during the day sometimes to clean the pizza ovens and you have to wait half an hour. We had one bad experience with the staff when we had a larger party and they were very rude to us but we haven't encountered that since. Great location, pizza and drinks."}
{"text":"Their Pizza Is Absolutely Amazing here. I love their white pizza it never dissapoints. The atmosphere is also nice here."}
{"text":"Turns out the salad and dessert options are on equal par with the pizza. We started with the ceasar salad for two and that had a good amount of croutons and dressing to get the meal underway. After that, the free birthday pizza arrived loaded with those excellent meatballs and this pizza was cooked perfectly. Finally, they had a banana cheesecake with Nila wafers and that was a really sweet ending as another year of my life fades into the distance."}
{"text":"Good pies and good service. Recommend getting a Italian sausage, roasted red peppers, and ricotta cheese pizza. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"High quality pizza i love it! The cheese is really awesome and the marinara sauce is so fresh and amazing. I like that the crust is so thin so you can taste the pizza and not the bread which is awesome. Restaurant is clean and in good condition just the way i like it when i go out to restaurant."}
{"text":"Not bad. The service was sub par. Pizza was just ok... A little bland is the best description. I was hoping for more."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here last night for the first time. Ordered a vegetarian pizza with 3 toppings. Expensive at about $22 for a 16 inch. It was about the driest pizza we had ever had and we had to request extra pizza sauce as they hardly put any sauce on the pizza. Apart from that it was just ok and we were not impressed. At least we tried it."}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Service is so friendly, one of our favorite places for a nice but fast lunch!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple weeks ago. One of my coworkers from NY raved about this place since he had positive experiences at the other locations here in Vegas. He also said \"Closes thing to NY Pizza\". This place was definitely well decorated from top to bottom. Our server was very nice and kept on raving about the \"Belgioso\" Top End cheese they used.. She was very accomodating and joyful!   Orders for a Party of 4 from their \"coal brick oven\"  18\" Large Pepperoni: At first stare I noticed their were a couple baked pieces of Fresh Basil leaves. Also noticed the thickness was my preference, not paper thin but not \"Pizza Hut Thick either. I grabbed a slice with a piece of Basil on it. Dough, Sauce, Pepperoni and Basil (might of gave it a little flair?) was one of the better pizzas i've had. It was like a Hybrid of NY Style Pizza and a splash of Settebello's Gourmet take on pizza.. Cheese didn't stretch much, had a thicker than usual consistency and tasted absoultely delicious! This was consumed in minutes.  18\" Large Sausage & Ricotta Cheese: Sausage slices were mild and had a hint of smokey flavor. The Ricotta's fluff and creamy flavor was Great. Only thing, I think they put a little too much Ricotta. Nevertheless, It was definitely satisfying! I think that Fresh Basil on top just adds a little something to each bite?! Server told us we could ask for whole pizzas to be sprinkled with Basil through out upon ordering. I think we may just do that the next time.   Very Nice place to dine and share a pie or 2 or 3.. with some friends/family. Service and Atmosphere quite swanky. Prices lean towards the higher side but worth it. I plan to come back soon!!"}
{"text":"Went in here a couple of days ago. Best pizza I ever had, so got another one. First on ham and pepperoni the second was a white pizza with ham and pepperoni. They were both amazing. After that we got a cheese cake and cannoli.   Our server was Eric. All good. My only problem with the whole experience was two people behind me whinging at the manager for what seemed like ten minutes about how bad Eric was or something? Which seemed very weird to me as we were sitting beside them and had great service. Literally not a problem with the service here."}
{"text":"I love this place for fantastic pizza. I have been to the original in Brooklyn, and I can't say that I notice any difference, and that is a great thing!!!  Now my experience here today was exceptional. Got to meet the manager Robert and talk with him today. A great host and a great ambassador for the brand!!  My wife and son were with me and we all felt that he made us feel at home today!!  I will return when I want great pizza and will bring our Vegas guests too!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with two of my friends for dinner and we were floored with the food and the service. We had an amazing server, Karen, that was so nice and attentive. We ordered the bruschetta, the kale salad and the Brooklyn pizza. I'm from New York and this stuff is the real deal. Karen told ya they have a chemist come in and work with the water to make it like New York's. Thoroughly impressed and would definitely come back and order different things off the menu, I'm sure they're all just as amazing."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in town. Its style is unique, but the flavor is to die for. If you have not had Grimaldi's yet, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Thank you Devon for the wonder customer service. The team was wonderful for me and my fiancé first time at this restaurant we had a great 4th of July nice place to get away and brig the sexy on the South west side. Bar for men and women wine and beer on draft eat in or on patio. That Pizza you been waiting for"}
{"text":"Disappointed after all the reviews I read. Agree that it is a nice atmosphere and in a nice location, but the pizza was bland. I like a lot of sauce on my pizza and this had very little. We ordered the Don and the Garden. We started with the Mediterranean salad and Spinach salad. They were the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"The gentleman at the rental car place suggested Grimaldi's. It was easy to find using our GPS. We started off with the antipasto, caprice salad, and ceased salad. The flavors were excellent, everything was fresh, and it was plenty enough for three people to share. We were full and could have stopped here, but we couldn't not try the pizza, so we ordered the seasonal special which was BBQ chicken and it was so good!!! The chicken was big pieces, the veggies were fresh, and the sauce was sweet yet tangy. The crust was so good and the slow roasted flavors compliments of their over method were excellent. The service was great and the restaurant was clean. The pieces were very fair considering the large portions. Being August, we did not sit outside on the patio due to the sweltering heat but it did look nice. This location is convenient if you're headed to Red Rock Canyon or the Hoover Dam. It's also nice to escape the hustle and bustle of the strip for a little bit. We will definitely be back on our next trip to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"My parents rave about this place, and whenever they are in the Scottsdale area, it is normally number one on their places they need to eat at. That being said, I am also a fan of Grimaldi's. WE were quickly seated and were next to the kitchen are. YOU can look in and see them making the pizzas, which I enjoyed. I opted to NOT SHARE MY PIZZA and got the Pesto Pizza and added Italian Sausage (ok, I let my sister have ONE piece). The thin crust was crunchy and not overdone, the cheese was perfectly gooey. I was very pleased and so was my overfull stomach. If you are reading this, I recommend this place to you! After devouring the pizza, I got a cannoli to-go, because I do not pass up the opportunity to get a cannoli, ever. And neither should you."}
{"text":"Been to Vegas 16 times but never ever eat pizza. So finally did some research and was happy of the TripAdvisor feedback for Grimaldis. Showed up late night mid-week. Place was petty dead but with so many options, I wasn't expecting a packed house.  Ordered the anti-pasta which instead of a mixed salad was all portioned perfectly on a plate. A little drizzle of oil and red wine vinegar made it worth the $14 price. Our pizza consisted of ricotta, sauce, red peppers, and sausage. I am not a huge fan of NY style pizza (like thick crust) but damnnnnn it was good. Can tell it was cooked over coals. Great flavorful crust, generous and delicious toppings. Was very happy with my pie and look forward to returning too. Service also stellar."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time at the Palazzo and 2 days later @ Boca Park.  We love the pesto pizza with Spinach!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and excellent service our waiter Kevin was exceptional first time here and we will definitely be back when in town"}
{"text":"HOLY CRAP.  pesto chicken is to die.  my son.. doesn't eat anything but cheese, but LOVES the pesto chicken. the last time me an my kids went for my husbands birthday when he was out of town on business, our waiter recommended we add mushrooms and it made it even that much more great.  the service is very friendly.. love Grimaldis!   I can't rate any other kind of pizza cause all I've had is the chicken pesto..  oh! caesar salad is also very delish.. 1 order is good for like 3 ppl.   also! it gets packed so be prepared if there's a wait.  not sure if they take reservations.. but if they do.. make one!"}
{"text":"white garlic pesto w/ chicken & mushrooms.  please do start with the caprese & if you are with a large party- order a round of the ceasar... it's best to have both!    it's very dark inside with a pretty dope stone oven with the cooks putting on a show prepping dough.  you get to meet a bubbly hostess at the door who will show you where to sit at one of the many tables inside a fairly large restaurant. If the weather is good, chill outside.  Las Vegas has some pretty good days, and even better nights to have a drink and a slice of pizza.      It's family friendly and the atmosphere is good.  The most important is the quality of service and the yummy pizza.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've eaten here, even if the food only consists of pizza.    *If you came here for something else, please don't be disappointed that this pizza joint serves pizza.  Just visit the very large full bar to the right of the entrance with pretty much all the tops, meds, and lows.  I'm pretty sure you'll be happy with the pizza after a couple drinks.  Choose from all the typical pizza toppings offered on the menu, but it's the sauces and crust that make this pizza yummy for me.    Good for friends!"}
{"text":"Waitress and manager bring pizzas to our table.They both say I'm sorry they put basil on your pizza by mistake ,as he sets it  down in front of me.Well ,if you knew my pizza was not what I ordered than why did you serve it to me? Snarky waitress...I do not recommend....many better places to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Be forewarned:  the food is alright but this place is like freaking  Romper Room with spoiled North Scottsdale brats running the joint!  It is really no better then the McDonalds kiddie jungle gym with one exception... I have never found a dirty diaper tucked into the corner here."}
{"text":"Best pizza & best waiter! Will definitely be going back! Pizza was thin & crisp with fresh ingredients. Waiter was very gracious!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!! Every time we are in Vegas we go to grimaldis! Pizza is delicious! And service is great! I make sure I take my own ranch cause they don't serve ranch!"}
{"text":"The Don pizza is the best. I added mushrooms to it! This is my second time here and I haven't tried any other pizza. I've been looking for great pizza for a long time since I left MI! This is it!!"}
{"text":"Went there again 6/10/2017  with 4 other people, the pizza was great salads great, service is always first rate, spent $137 with tip.  Being a wine collector I really enjoy a good glass of red wine with pizza.  Well, last night the wine was HOT, not warm HOT, it had to be at least 77-79 degrees.  This is embarrassing for a quality place like Grimaldi's. You can afford a $1300 168 bottle wine cooler for that giant space in the Quarter and don't tell me there is no space for it.  Common Joey, let's chill that wine to 65 degrees and make the experience a bit better, we deserve it.  I if necessary add a dime ( $.10) to the price of the drink and you will pay off the cooler in 6 months and start adding more gross margin to the books after that  I spend $2000 a year at your place a nice glass of properly chilled glass of wine isn't too much to ask.  I don't want my wine carafe dipped in a bucket of ice like last night.  I hope u take this well from a valued client.  Oh, what happened to the wine cooler up in DC Ranch?  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"After the disturbing experience upstairs at Narcisse, our party of six sought out a quieter place that would actually allow us to enjoy each others company without competing with obnoxious techno music.  We found it at Grimaldi's Pizzeria. This turned out to be a good choice since our bodies were still craving carbs after our over-consumption at our Thanksgiving meal the day before.  Pizza was the perfect solution, even though it meant three hours at the gym today.  We had to wait a short period of time, so we sought out the outdoor bar so as to enjoy a beverage prior to getting our table.  I would love to come back here to dine al fresco when it's a bit warmer.  The beer and wine selections are quite nice. I enjoyed the San Tan Brewery Devil's Ale, which is much like an IPA. My lady had the  Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, which was very nice considering that it was the house red.  We shared a small Mediterranean salad, which had the perfect combination of lettuce, veggies, feta cheese, and Kalamata olives.  The vinaigrette was very nice.  All of the pizzas are made to order.  We created ours with sliced tomatoes and fresh garlic and basil.  Basically a Neapolitan pizza.  It was delicious, but quite overpriced by the time you add your choices of toppings.  What do you expect? You are in Scottsdale.  We all seemed to enjoy our experience here.  The service was attentive, and we were actually allowed to be louder than our surroundings, unlike the place upstairs.  The conversation was very enjoyable once I could actually hear what was being said.  We will be back in town in February and I think this place deserves a return visit from us."}
{"text":"Tonight was great. I had a calzone, pepperoni and olive,  Coppola Zinfandel, the wife had a pizza with nice and hot jalapenos. The staff was nice, so much that we made comments to each other about the quality."}
{"text":"Pesto pizza highly recommend! Great place to go to for a date with your girl anytime of day"}
{"text":"Haven't been in awhile and now I remember what I am missing. Good pizza is hard to find in las Vegas and thus place delivers the goods. Thin crust which I prefer with a good crunch fresh ingredients and a tasty sauce. What more could u ask for in a pizza?"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience at Gramaldi's. Our server Tyler was a nice kid, very inviting personality and attentive to our requests. Even the server who brought our desert let my 1 yr old male eyes at her and blow kisses. Those are the things that make a restaurant experience wonderful when I'm with my whole family."}
{"text":"The menu is concise and to the point, you won't find a bunch of spaghetti, fettuccine or ravioli.  Pizza, salad and calzones.  Definitely a good place for thin crust pizza.  For a table of two, get the Large!  You will have at least one leftover slice, maybe two.  Toppings are always based on personal preference...I can tell you a couple here that are worth your while.  Kalamata olives and ricotta cheese.  Oh man.  They make the pie.  I also suggest extra sauce, cause sauce is the difference maker on most pizzas.    If you get the pepperoni, they are little mini guys and they get a little crispy on top.  I usually prefer the roni under the cheese, but these guys put it on top to crisp it up a bit.  Traditional NY style cut in wedges that you can fold...with the extra sauce it can get a little sloppy.  I good spot for a late lunch in a great location."}
{"text":"First time trying this place.  The pizza and appetizers were delicious!! The prices are reasonable and the service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great! service was so-so. maybe it was because they were closing in about in hour when we walked in, but we constantly had to ask our waiter for our water because he 'forgot.'  The table we sat at outdoors was very unstable, I felt as if my beer was going to fall off the table and the wine glasses were going to fall and crack as well.  But other than that, pizza was exceptional and so was the salad."}
{"text":"Awesome pepperoni pizza. Crust was crispy and flavorful. Not overwhelmed with cheese and had a lot of crispy pepperoni on it. Super delicious."}
{"text":"As many times as we drove by the location on Eastern and never tried it,  we decided to try their location on Rainbow.  we arrived around 5:30 PM on a Friday night........the parking sucks.  Besides Hooters sharing this parking lot, there are several fast food outlets here as well and they have marked their territory in the parking lot.  So that's the negative about this place.  We were greeted warmly at the door by the hostesses who also hold open the door for you.  We were seated immediately and the kids were asked if they would like pizza dough to play with...cool!      Our server, Jo-Jo, graciously welcomed us as first timers and explained the menu.  We ordered a large cheese pizza for the kids, and we ordered a large sausage, basil and xtra cheese along with a Caprese salad.  we thought about ordering the house or Caesar salad but wanted to try the Caprese first.  The serving was large enough for splitting as were the other salads that have been previously mentioned by others below.  Both pizzas arrived and were thin crusts that were baked well in the coal oven. Our kids rarely eat the crust edge of the pizza but ate them here.  They also seemed like their pizza here over Settebello's,  Our table was constantly being attended to without being overbearing.  Drinks refilled quickly.  The manager on duty greeted us at the table and welcomed us warmly also as first timers.  In fact, she brought over some Canoli's for us as a welcome gift without realizing we had already placed an order for the strawberry cheesecake.  Save room for their cheesecake is all we can say........  We will definitely be repeat customers, though we may try the Eastern location to see if the parking is better there."}
{"text":"Stopped in after La Rev for a quick bite.. not so quick. Pizza took forever! It was good but it was slow, especially for 9pm!  No ranch either... BOO! Busy place with a decent looking Italian menu. Lots of wine! Good pizza."}
{"text":"This is very simple, no back story needed...  Bar service- AWFUL.  My friends and I were treated so rudely by not 1 but 3 bartenders.    It was so bad, I wish they could get negative stars.  Food- AMAZING.  The best pizza in Arizona.    Terrible service= terrible review.  The Gilbert location is 1,000 times better."}
{"text":"Finding parking is a pain when you just want to get pickup but it was worth the long walk after I finally got a spot. Pizza was delicious, but even with extra cheese it had bald spots. I've noticed \"gourmet\" pizza places do this a lot. I dislike the trend. The sause was actually really good and I'm very picky about that. Cheese was top notch as well and the pepperoni was adorably small but well spread around the pizza.  9/10 would pizza again."}
{"text":"Really like Grimaldi's when I am craving for some New York coal fired brick oven Pizza. It definitely has it's own unique taste and is a treat. Yummo.  Been to a few of their other locations and each one is slightly different inside and out. This one has a nice covered patio when you are in the mood for partying outside.  Normally get there when they open and go with a 16\" Sausage, Pepperoni and Shrooms. Seen a version of a Pesto Pizza brought to the table next to me and it looked and smelled awesome. I'm getting hungry just writing this review.  Very friendly and prompt service during the lunch hour. What I like most is they will bring you extra shakers to spike up your NY pie. Some extra garlic, parmesan cheese, a good sprinkle of oregano and a large amount crushed chili peppers gets me jumping. Nice!  This location is in the top secret DC Ranch. I say top secret because it is tricky even seeing it from the street. Good thing we know friends that live nearby and take us to other restaurants in THE RANCH. Use your GPS if it helps. GIDDY UP!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is always a wonderful place to eat ! Food is extremely quality and consistent ! Love love their Caesar salad and how nice and efficient all of the servers are ! Definitely recommend coming here if you haven't already !!!"}
{"text":"Went here twice now - one for late lunch, one for dinner.   During the first time we went here, my boyfriend likes the place, but he doesn't like the price. We had the four cheese pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms, and New York cheesecake. We liked the FOUR CHEESE PIZZA WITH PEPPERONI AND MUSHROOMS, but it's a bit too salty for me. I'd say, don't go for the four cheese.  The NEW YORK CHEESECAKE would've been plain for me, but the raspberry drizzle helped with the flavor. On the contrary, my boyfriend likes it because it's not too sweet. My boyfriend says we'd go there more often if it wasn't too expensive.  And so we did. This time, it was with friends from San Diego. It was really busy at night. We waited for about 30-45 minutes, then had to wait some more after ordering. While waiting for a table, you can go outside, and get a drink. It sucks though since they didn't have heaters there, and it was pretty cold that night. We had ROASTED BELL PEPPERS AND SAUSAGE WITH RED SAUCE, and FETA CHEESE AND SPINACH WITH WHITE SAUCE. They were delicious. I just got annoyed that the server wants us to order more. Servers try to pressure customers to order more so they can get a bigger tip. We're pretty generous with our tips if the service is great so pressuring us to order more will only get you a low tip.   It's in our neighborhood so I'd go there again if I have a pizza craving."}
{"text":"I give this place four stars because it lives up to the expectation of offering authentic pizza in an ever more fake world.   This place reminds me of the classic pizza parlors (as they used to be called) that I remember all over the Texas and Oklahoma New Mexico region when I was growing up in the late 70s and early 80s. Places like Shakey's pizza. Shotgun Sam's. Pizza planet. (Although this place is a little more upscale). Hand tossed pizza (there was no other kind) cooked in a brick oven. Real ingredients. Checker table cloth. All the trappings of good olde skool pizza.   One thing that's mildly amusing, is how this place caters to kids. As such, be prepared for the noise.   There was a family with four small children next to us who's favorite hobby of one of the toddlers was throwing his metal toy bus at other people, or just on the ground. We watched the mom pick up the toy and give it back to the child only to have him do it again and again. And again. Pretty much the whole time we were there. (People are weird)  Anyway, it's noisy.  Don't plan on having a quiet romantic dinner here because this isn't the place for that.  It was difficult having a conversation. It's great for families with small kids, however and there's nothing wrong with that.  Not even in yuppy, uppity, old town Scottsdale.   Anyway, the pizza was excellent, the cheesecake was awesome, and the service was great!    I'll be back for the charcoal fired pizza for sure because it reminds me of my childhood growing up in Oklahoma, where they know how to make pizza."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up since I've been here, will go to the frozen section of my supermarket to get my pizza at half the price"}
{"text":"The service here is always great.  My husband and I prefer to sit at the bar and don't have any complaints.  Get the pizza, with anything on it, you're bound to be a happy camper.  I also recommend the anitpasta- yum :)  What I don't recommend is arriving between 4 pm-5pm as they are stocking the oven and there's no pizza magic happening then.  Food = awesomely amazing. Service= awesomely amazing.  We had Nikki last night, and she's great."}
{"text":"The pizza is usually pretty solid here, but tonight it was a touch overcooked and you really couldn't eat all the crust without needing a gallon of water to wash it down. It wasn't enough to send it back, plus it took 20 minutes to reach the table in the first place. It was a first date, so luckily we had good conversation and wine, so waiting wasn't an issue, plus I was cashing in on my free birthday pizza. The staff was nice, but I didn't know you could make reservations here and apparently all the outdoor tables were reserved? Bonus points for not allowing the moron with his pit bull to dine here also. Usually a good joint, but they were a bit off their pizza cooking game this time."}
{"text":"I am a pizza lover.  I actively search out the best pizza.  When I go on vacation, I make sure to visit at least a few of the top rated pizza places in the state I am in.  But Grimaldi's still beats them all out.  Even though I am a pizza enthusiast I am not one who can analyze every ingredient, so I won't be describing the pizza taste in detail here, I just know if it tastes good or not.  I just got back from a trip to Seattle, and visited two places that claimed to be certified from Italy for their pizza, and I would still take Grimaldi's over them.  I think Bianca is way over hyped, and I'm not one who is eager to wait over two hours for my dinner.  Salads are great, pizza is great GO HERE!!!  Only thing I would complain about is that all pizzas are make your own, and adding a couple toppings can run up the bill.  But even just getting pepperoni is amazing."}
{"text":"First time at a Grimaldi's. The smell was amazing before I even got to the door. A hostess opened the door for us and immediately sat us. The service was prompt and the pizza was AMAZING. We joined the e-mail club while we were there and got a $5 off coupon that we used on the bill. Also, the environment and decor was awesome. Great food, great atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"Read reviews and picked Grimaldi's for lunch. Pizza was excellent with a very crunchy and flavorful crust.  Small house salad was just enough for two with the pizza.  Service was excellent. Nice atmosphere. Would go there again when in Scottsdale.  Price was reasonable and we were not rushed."}
{"text":"My wife an I came for her free birthday pizza an the restaurant was more than accommodating  to the two of us. This Grimaldi's location is a 5 star with appearance of the restaurant, service an quality of food. Would definitely recommend to others. 5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"This place was great! I started with a margarita on the rocks and it was perfect. Then two of us shared a small pizza. It was a good size if you're hungry. It was 6 decent size pieces, so we have leftovers. We got the pepperoni pizza. Everything about the pizza was great. The crust was thin. All the ingredients seemed so fresh. The service was great as well. I would definitely come back! For a dr pepper, margarita and small pepperoni pizza it cost $29.46 with tax."}
{"text":"Well, it was ok if you are in the area and are hungry. The waiter was nice!"}
{"text":"Tried Grimaldi's for the first time yesterday.  We ordered to go and got the Cesar Salad and the sundries tomato, artichoke heart and pepperoni pizza! The salad was very fresh and delicious with big slices of parmesan cheese.  Then the pizza was absolutely to die for!!! $33 dollars for the meal which is a little pricy for two people but well worth it.  We will never go to another pizza place again!"}
{"text":"I gave Grimaldis a 3 rating because when we were here last year I would of gave them a 5 star and this visit they would of received a 1 star. I will talk about this visit as it was the most recent. We order the bruschetta as a starter and it may of actual been the worst we ever had. I'm thinking that it was pretty quiet in there meaning the cooks probably prepared some of the items too far in advance. The bread was harder then a crouton and literally crumbled into dust when you bit into it. The pizza was good but not great. The wait staff was good and was on top of our needs. Due to this lesser of experiences I most likely will not be back next year when I'm in Vegas which is sad to say as I love Pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner here after getting in late, and the pizza was amazing!   Coal Brick Oven NYC style pizza. Got the Brushetta Pizza which is a white pizza topped with tomatoes, basil, and Italian cheese blend. The crust was amazing with plenty of toppings.   Sat at the bar and the service was spot on. Will definitely stop back when in the area."}
{"text":"Good place to eat pizza of you're in Fashion Show mall. New York style pizza but in terms of thickness only. True NY pizza would have had more cheese, more grease and be able to fold it.  Someone posted they have garlic knots. They dont.  Decent meal that won't break your wallet. Wait staff was really nice.  Tip to staff....if people come in and it's not a couple ask if they want separate checks. Otherwise it's awkward."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's food is consistently amazing. If you've never tried the coal-fired brick oven pizza, I highly suggest you make a visit soon.   Their salads are always extremely crisp and fresh, and the pizzas are always amazing. If you're dining for two, a small salad and a small pizza will still leave you feeling stuffed! For salads, I usually always get the house salad or their Mediterranean salad (although the Caesar dressing is awesome). For pizzas, I recommend their pepperoni and sausage, especially if it's your first visit.  The one negative thing I have to say about this specific location is that the service varies greatly from visit to visit. Sometimes the wait staff is extremely attentive and friendly. The last time I visited, however (last week), our waitress was very unfriendly, barely smiling or making eye contact, and we had to wait for several minutes with empty water glasses before she made her way over to our table. That happened more than once. The restaurant was not that crowded as it was a week night at 8:30ish. A little service hiccup will not prevent me from heading back though!  If you'd like a refreshing pre-dinner drink, I highly suggest the Lambrusco that is on their current wine list. A lovely find, and not too expensive. Looking forward to the weather cooling back down a bit so I can share a bottle on their outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Very nice pizza and excellent ambience. Our server was also very nice and inspite being tired and having a long day he had a smile on his face all the time. Pizza was well made crispy and as expected. Would love to go again"}
{"text":"I have been to Grimaldis a couple of times now and I won't be back for a third.  I have no problem paying for good food but this place is more style than substance.  Their pizza sauce is absolutely tasteless.  The sausage was really good but they really skimp on the amount they put on the pizza.  When they brought the pizza out it looked fantastic but when I started to eat it lacked any flavor.  The crust also does not stand up well to their watery sauce.  The middle of the pizza was like a soup.    My wife ordered the ceasar salad with chicken on top.  The greens seemed fresh but the chicken is the typical Cysco bought painted on grill marked chicken you find at most fast food places.  I will never understand how an actual restaurant serves anything that is pre- cooked from a food distributor.    I work to hard for my money to give it to places like Grimaldis Pizzeria.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"No very impressed. Service wasn't great and the food took forever. I could tell the server knew we were unhappy and kept \"overly trying\" to help us and it ended up being annoying. We won't be back..."}
{"text":"I just moved to Scottsdale and stumbled upon Scottsdale Quarter while walking around the immediate area.  I had been craving pizza since I got here and was excited to find Grimaldi's.    I initially planned on getting a personal pizza to go but once I sat down at the bar the friendly and chill service and vibe made me decide to eat in.  The pizza was great.  Perfect thin crust and a light sauce and more than enough for one person.  Prices were reasonable for the area.  I definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"Authentically gourmet pizza at a reasonable price (for the Strip) that doesn't break the bank. Pizza tastes pretty much like the NYC version - fresh tomato sauce, good quality cheese, thin and chewy crust - mission accomplished!"}
{"text":"It was ok the seating was horrible the table kept wiggling but the waiter did do a good job there menu is very limited it's ok if u don't like having a great selection I thought it would be good cause I've heard about it but it just wasn't my cup of tea"}
{"text":"Went there for my moms free birthday pizza;) it was 4pm and we had to wait longer for the pizza to be made because they clean the ovens every day at that time :( but pizza was good wish they would put the cheese on the whole pizza.... they didn't have too much on the menu. Just pizza, salads, drinks and deserts I would love it if they added pasta or chicken parmesan"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's pizza is good (3.5 stars).  Problem is, it should be amazing (especially for the whopping price tag).  The menu boasts a wonderful list of fresh ingredients for pizza toppings, all topped with fresh mozzarella.    The simple rundown: - crispy, delicious crust (5 star crust) - salty, tasty fresh mozzarella - soft tasting, smooth tomato sauce (not remarkable, but tasty enough) - wonderful list of ingredients (including roasted garlic) - everything blends together well and the pizza's not overly greasy  Just writing out that list, I want to head back there and order another pizza, but then I remember that I just wasn't wowed.  Somehow all of that goodness fails to rise up to greatness and you're left eating a pizza that you enjoy, but . . . well, just enjoy.  All of which earns Grimaldi's 4 stars (I mean, I am a fan).  But put the price tag on the pizza and it loses half a star.  Bottom line: they're just not living up to what they're charging."}
{"text":"I was a big fan until last night.  I didn't have a problem dropping 75 on pizza for our family of 4 when it was good.  First the Romaine in the Caesar Salad was bitter, according to my wife and kids.  The pizza we ordered came out wrong after waiting 45 minutes.  The manager came over and offered to remake the pizza and a free desert for our inconvenience.  The first pizza was on them, so to help with my starvation I dug into the first piece with a huge disappointment.  My wife was already upset with me as I complained about the pizza being wrong in the first place, so for a moment I held back giving her my thoughts of that first bite.  I couldn't take it after the second bite and told her my thoughts.  She agreed.  I thought maybe the second pizza would be better. It wasn't.   Not only this but it took forever to get the bill and pay.  I will not be returning anytime soon, if at all."}
{"text":"I'm a foodie and am usually pretty critical with my reviews. This pizza is outstanding. The pepperoni pizza is full of mini pepperonis that are packed with a delicious spicy flavor. The crust is perfect. The large is huge and definitely worth the price. I've been searching for a tasty pizza place in the area and just about everywhere else has fallen flat except for Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a classic joint - always has been. It's nice to go somewhere and know exactly what your going to get. Erica took care of me and she recommended a Peroni and the Kale salad. Everything was excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was very good here however the service left a little to be desired. The waitress never came back to refill drinks. We found a manager to do that. After he did that, she checked on it once more."}
{"text":"My ideal heaven would be eating pizza all day and drinking Jones' Cream Soda.  I love pizza so much I can eat an entire large pizza by myself.  So in short I'm a HUGE pizza fanatic, I always try new pizza places.  I can honestly say Grimaldi's is by far, hands down my favorite.  Now I have tried Pizzaria Bianco, which I've heard is suppose to be the best pizza in the world, so it may change."}
{"text":"I have never given a pizza a 5 star rating except in Italy.  This place is so wonderful we went back twice on our weeks vacation for the Giants spring training. The pizza is just  the best we ever had.  We ordered a small size with tomatoes and basil and it was big enough for the two of us with a piece left over. We each ordered a small salad ($5.) and they were big, we should have listened to our waitress who said they were big enough for two.  If you love real Italian pizza with fresh mozzarella and incredible home made sauce cooked in a brick oven like they do in Italy, go here and enjoy!  The only problem is we can't get anything this good in California."}
{"text":"Tried a different location and it was a much better experience. Ordered the mediterranean salad...so good. And a pepperoni and fresh garlic pizza and it was very delicious. I like a coal fired pizza, I like the crisp. blackened crust and this crust was great...I may ask for it to be left in the oven a little longer for a crust that has a few more black spots. But the crust was chewy and overall this was a great dining experience. The wait staff was terrific and I have not one single complaint! YAY! Oh wait...I'm Italian, Sicilian actually and was raised by my Sicilian grandma who served every meal with BREAD! Where is the bread? Every table should be served with bread! I know it's high is carbs but it's also high in taste!  My previous, less fabulous review was for the location in Henderson, this one is for the newly opened south west location. BTW, they still can't touch Metro!  One more thing, this pizza is best when eaten at the restaurant. I ordered take out once and I do not reccomend it. You lose the crispiness of the crust and it turns a bit soggy. Also, its not good reheated. It is at it's all time best straight from the coal oven."}
{"text":"We really like Grimaldi's. The pizza is delicious. The service is good...it's never really crowded yet sometimes service is kinda slow. But no biggie. The food is worth it. I deduct one star because they only have pizza & salad. And we've tried probably half the salads offered, and none of them really blow us away. We laughed at the antipasto when it came out because it was so far from what we were expecting!! They're all just wimpy and kinda sad. But it's not called Grimaldi's salad bar and the pizza more than makes up for it. I love the charred spots on the pizza and that the crust is crisp yet still chewy. It's close to home and delicious. What more could you ask for??"}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic. Service was pretty bad.  We arrived late on Monday night about 2 hours before closing. Our server did not appear pleased we were there. We asked for refills several times unsuccessfully. We asked for bread twice which was ignored both times. We asked for a box that was never brought. We watched our server fulfill his closing duties while we sat with empty drinks. The poor service was a a damper on what we thought was fantastic NY style pizza.  Food gets 5 stars. Service gets 1 star."}
{"text":"Just a couple of things: 1. We have ordered take-out pizza twice since I have posted the first review.  Delicious!  The only down side: the pizza cools down VERY fast... so if you live more than 10 minutes away, forget it!  Just sit down inside!  2. If you go to their website and sign up for their mailing list, they will give you $5 off your next dine-in visit.  Definitely worth putting your email address in... and you don't get slammed with stuff.  I haven't received anything from them, besides the $5 off coupon."}
{"text":"I just got back from Italy couple of months ago & haven't been able to eat any pizza here since...finally remembered i went to Grimaldis in old town years back & liked it....tried the one in Scottsdale Quarter by my house & it was even better. Just got the Thin Crust, with Roasted Red pepper + Ricotta cheese..yum yum yum...also nice atmosphere there!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza restaurant. The food tastes as good as at a fine Italian restaurant except the bill for two people will be about $20."}
{"text":"This is the best NY Style Pizza I have had. Very well prepared with top quality ingredients. We started with a house salad and enjoyed that quite a bit. The Pizza was yummy. I can't wait for another visit to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Awesome food, service and wine at great value!  Julio is the best manager ever!  15 dollars for carafe of Italian wine is a great value!"}
{"text":"Damon is awesome server and Italian sausage with onions large pizza is beyond amazing!  Barbera red wine from Italy is phenomenal for only 28 a bottle!"}
{"text":"Came in here for a late afternoon lunch with K.O.  As soon as we came in the door a older lady (owner?manager?) came and greeted us and sat us down promptly.  She also explained a bit about how the menu worked since it was our first time here.  Caesars Salad - Lettuce seemed fresh and crispy.  Dressing was delicious and creamy.  Pizza - we made a custom small pizza. We added ricotta cheese, pepporoni, and fresh garlic.  The pizza was delicious, dough chewy, and dripping with oil. Just how i like my NY style pizza.  The only thing I wish I could taste more of was the garlic.  K.O. and I both couldnt really taste the garlic.  We also had a cannoli for dessert. The outside was crispy and the cream inside wasnt too creamy if that makes sense.    All in all we had a good meal here.  Just got to remember to get the personal size pizza to share amongst the two of us."}
{"text":"I am not a big pizza fan.  I don't like anything with tomatoes or tomato based sauce, including pizza.  However, Grimaldi's has made me rethink my opinion on pizza.  My husband, mother in law & I decided to try Grimaldi's after walking around the Palazzo in starvation.  It was the only restaurant without an hour wait, so pizza it was.  Our first time there, I got a calzone (the size of my head, by the way) & it was delicious.  My husband & his mother shared a buffalo chicken pizza and said it was one of the best pizzas they've ever had.  We also downed a pitcher of strong sangria.  That was fun.  During our next visit a few weeks later, I got a thin crust pepperoni pizza & ate the whole thing by myself!  We, of course, had more sangria.  Grimaldi's is now our go-to place when we need a pizza fix.  The only downfall is that it's so far away from our house!  We only ever go when we are headed near the strip.  I saw recently that another location opened in Tivoli Village, so we will have to check that one out too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but this is my first review.  The pizza is definitely tasty - nothing frozen here.  We did receive iffy service once but my other experiences were positive."}
{"text":"This place was great. We had just come from another place where they said they couldn't seat us (despite half the tables being open). Our waitress was really friendly and we got seated right away. The salad and pizza were great and the outdoor patio was super nice to sit on. I'd definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for quick, affordable Italian in a friendly setting."}
{"text":"Wow amazing pizza! I was born and raised in California but my dad was from New York, so growing up I got the chance to taste some of the best pizza in New York. Let me tell you this place rocks, Make sure to get there Ceaser Salad I always get the bigger one and take it home the next day for some left overs for my Wife and I. All there pizzas are amazing have not been dissapointed yet. Last month there special was there BBQ pizza which was to DIE FOR!!! I am a huge pizza guy and let met tell you there pizzas are amazing and very resonable. The wait on Friday and Saturdays is not always the best, so try to plan to get there early. Just to warn you they dont serve ranch , at first I was a little upset but there pizzas are so good after a few bites you dont remember why you needed ranch for your Pizza. The pizzza come right out of the oven and are steaming at your table. They only use fresh ingredients and you can taste that in the quality of there Pizza. Make sure to save room for there Canoli, The only one I have had as good if not better is on Arthur Ave in the Bronx. So if you dont want to travel to NY then travel down to the San Tan Village in Gilbert for Arizonas best pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm a big pizza fan and Grimaldis offers some great pies! I like the DC ranch location more than others just because if feels more upscale than the rest (i also live 10min away). I've been here numerous times and have always tried something different. My favorite pizza was recommended by the waiter: meatball and ricotta cheese. I wouldn't have picked this on my own but boy was it delicious! The thin crust was baked just enough to where the crust was soft, chewy and a little crispy a the same time! Prices were a little high but you do get a good sized pizza. The salads were also great--my gf and I always split the greek salad. They always have a rotating selection of desert, we tried the blueberry cheesecake which was excellent. The only minus would be the lack of selection when it came to beer. I dont think they had anything on draft and only a small selection of bottled beer. One last tip, be sure to sign up for email club, you get a free pizza for your birthday!!"}
{"text":"Bar is not good quality. I prefer someone who actually cares about how my day day is, that's how you make money since my BF and I tip between 30-50% when we go out. I asked the bartender if they have a full bar and he said yes. I asked if he could add a different flavor to my lemon drop and he insisted on leaving the drink how it comes... thanks for the accommodation! We did not order pizza since we watched 4 pizzas delivered at the bar and the bottom was burned on all of them. My boyfriend and I never write bad reviews, but this place was absurd. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The best in Arizona  I used to live near the original in Brooklyn so I may be biased but it tastes the same. Go for mushroom and pepperoni or try the white pizza. Salads are also good."}
{"text":"I don't regularly eat pizza/cheese (due to lactose intolerance) but this place I will eat again. Pizza was delicious, and a salad should definitely be ordered alongside. Dessert, though very tempting, is not worth the money."}
{"text":"Bit of a wait, but they text you once a table is ready, so you can wander San Tan Village until then.  Generous sizing, fresh rounds of cheese on the pizza, thin crust, not \"the\" best pizza ever, but definitely good stuff.  Attentive service and waitstaff."}
{"text":"First of all - I am sad that the location on Alma school shut down :( it was close by and view from patio was pleasant.  On the flip side, the Ray Rd location was incredible! Really lively on a Friday night and best part is the staff took really good care of us.   I ordered the small House salad and a large pizza with Jalapeños. The best part of Grimaldis pizzas are that they are thin and the sauce has an unique taste - love it!  He cheese is not overwhelming either so perfect for a group of 3-4 people.  I have to say if you guys don't have a spicy pallet, fear the jalapeños - they are spicy!!!   The salad was good too - had the dressing on the side but the portion was just perfect for the three of us - giving us enough space to demolish the pizza ;)  Overall great experience - love the ambience, decor, service and food quality! This is one place I won't hesitate to go again!"}
{"text":"I am updating this review due to the fact that I actually got to try the pizza this time. I caved and went to Grimaldis to try the pizza last night. I have been wanting to for a very long time now. Ive been to the one in Scottsdale and was not that impressed. One of my co-workers told me he has been to this one and loves the pizza here. My curiosity got the better of me so I went.      It was packed so I had to wait about 30 minutes. When I was called I was seated at a tiny little table in the back corner. Not exactly the best seat in the house I have to say. The waiter came over after about 10 minutes and took my order. After another 20 minutes the pizza arrived. It looked good and smelled good and tasted fantastic! I do have to admit this was one excellent pizza. Great sauce, very good crust and just the right amount of grease for flavor. And yes I did say grease. A pizza is not a pizza without a bit of grease to make it taste good.       Even though I had the interesting, \"stoking the ovens\" fiasco the first time I tried to eat here, I will be back. This would be a nice date place on maybe a Thursday or Sunday when it's not so busy. I recommend the pepperoni and sausage. They both had great flavor and really made the pizza. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Finally went here last night with my mother and tried the pizza. I, like the fool that i am, did not try the original Grimaldis under the Brooklyn Bridge in NY when I was there a few years back. I have heard great things about this place so we went. Nice room with a very nice patio. The place was packed on a Monday night at 7pm. We ordered the small pizza with sausage and pepperoni and a large Ceaser salad. The salad was good but nothing to write home about. Finally the pizza came and it looked nice and smelled very good. Sadly, after the first bite I realized the smell was the best part of this pizza. Rather tasteless. The crust was ok, the sausage really had very little flavor. We had Barros pizza a few nights before this and we both agreed we much preferred there's over Grimaldis. We finished and payed the rather overpriced bill and left. I will not be back. Service was excellent and the place was nice and in a nice area, but the food was nowhere near up to par."}
{"text":"I first tried Grimaldi's at the Brooklyn location under the Brooklyn Bridge and have been a fan ever since. I was concerned that AZ wouldn't be able to reproduce the crispy, slightly charred thin crust of the east coast version but I was not disappointed. Having grown up on the east coast, pizza means something very particular and Grimaldi's fits the bill. The ingredients are fresh, the flavor perfect and the service is always friendly. There can be long waits at the typical popular eating times but go early or on an off night and you will get right in. The salads and desserts are excellent as well.   Phoenix has transformed from a pizza wasteland to a treasure trove of pizza delight. Grimaldi's should be high on the list of any pizza lover."}
{"text":"Great restaurant but it seems the service has been slipping lately. We had a party of 10 for dinner for Christmas eve(yearly tradition) service was quite poor. Manager never stopped by to say hi. Food took an extra long time. Felt bad leaving 20 percent tip,  but who stiffs a server at Christmas?  May look elsewhere for next year's new tradition spot.  Will give another try to see if this was just a bad night. Always had a great time prior. Great pizza but for the price my expectations are higher."}
{"text":"This place does not compare to its sibling in new York.  The dough was soggy and the crust, it was eh..  the salad was good though as well as the service!"}
{"text":"Pizza - 3 stars.   Nothing special IMHO.   Tasted fine but I've had much better.   Crust was too tough. House Salad -  3 stars.   Too much dressing. Sour. Beer - 1 star.   Don't insist it's a pint when it's not. Amaretto Cheesecake - 5 stars.  Fantastic.    Service - 3 stars.  Nothing special. Price - 2 stars.  A bit expensive for what you get.  I probably won't come back anytime soon.   I have too many great pizza places on my A list.  But it was worth a try."}
{"text":"Two stars for the help.  Waiters standing around running their hands through their hair.  Rubbing the face and eyes. When you are wait staff and serving people I think that's unacceptable.  The food is excellent."}
{"text":"My wife and I were first introduced to Grimaldi's pizza in Brooklyn. I'd say it was one of the top five pizza experiences of my life, so when we heard about  a Grimaldi's in Vegas we knew we couldn't miss it. We walked for a good hour down the strip so we could check it out. We were a little skeptical at first, thinking it would be similar but not as good. Boy was I wrong. They ship the water out from NY to recreate the same experience. SO worth it. Do not miss this place if you find yourself near the Palazzo!"}
{"text":"I won't go as far as to say its the best pizza ever, but it is worth the trip into a maze of a mall.  Solid food, good bar, and great service. I was in the mood for pizza in Vegas, and this place was highest rated, so why the hell not.  I was not disappointed.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Went here last night for my birthday with my family. Margarita and sausage pizza was awesome, we also had a large salad that was enough for our family of 5. Our server was a women named Lany if you go request to be in her section. She made our visit great! Love her personality and she did a great job! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Sign-up for their e-Newsletter to receive your birthday gift - a Free Large Pizza with one topping - up to a $19 value. That's what I did and we ordered another topping, a drink, and a Mediterranean Salad which was superior."}
{"text":"The service was fast snd friendly. The portions are large and the spinach salad and pizza were really really good. Two of us split a small salad and small pizza and couldn't come close to eating it all.  The prices were very reasonable. I would be regular if I lived here."}
{"text":"Such yummy pizza! Great sauce, great toppings, and the crust is perfect. I've had it at the original location in NYC and it was one of the best pizzas I've ever had; the Vegas version almost lived up to the original. Like the NYC version, the center was just a little bit wet, but that's the only complaint I can think of. I just wish I had more."}
{"text":"What great pizza! Good thin-crust brick-oven pizza. Not overloaded with cheese and toppings, but rather just enough. The place has a good atmosphere and nice staff. One the few really good pizza places I've found since moving to Vegas 15 years ago."}
{"text":"Just like every other Grimaldi's... Good pizza, good calzones, good appetizers and salads, good drinks.  Only drawback here was the wait staff.  While they weren't terrible, they are not outstanding.  Wait staff is average at best."}
{"text":"Pizza here is yummy, oven bake which gives the pizza  the perfect crunchy smokey flavor. We had several pizza's the Margharita and The Don. Because we knew it would take long it was on  Saterday night we had drinks which they have a large variety of with an order of Caprese and Bruschetta trio. This was the perfect appittizer for our group while we waited.  The service was ok we had to wave down our waitress if we need anything  and she was apologetic about it.  We did not let this bother us since they were busy. We will return ."}
{"text":"We always go to the one up north scottsdale. First time in here. Service was slow. Actually very slow. Ordered the salad. Tomatoes were raw. Bad management."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, for dinner, lunch or happy hour. Pizza with ricotta is the best! The spinach salad is great, and the Bridge pizza is one of their best. Cannoli's are pretty good too. Needs chocolate drizzle, but overall very tasty. Great for large parties as well. The crust is thin crust and a little overdone, I like a less done, chewier crust."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, excellent service and the Oreo cheesecake is AMAZING! I'd recommend this to anyone who wants authentic pizza."}
{"text":"This place has great food, great service and is in a great location. The lunch specials are a good deal, but if your eating and drinking here for dinner your tab will be pretty high. Just make sure you check the beer and wine prices before ordering or you could be sitting there staring at your bill going \"wtf.\""}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had, and definitely the best New York style pizza I've had. This was one of my favorite meals in Vegas. We had a large The Don and finished every bite between the two of us. The crust was thin but sturdy. The flavor of the tomato sauce was so delicious that it stood out to me. I like my food very saucy, so I had to ask for extra to dip. There were plenty of toppings and fresh mozzarella though. Every element came together to make the perfect pizza. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Javier  is the man. Great salads and great pizza. Unbelievable service lots of fun great place to visit."}
{"text":"LOVE it here!!! Its so yummy and let's be honest who doesn't love good pizza and a nice glass of wine. Plus the service was perfect thank you we will be back! Perfect date night :)"}
{"text":"The pizza here is pretty good, but on the pricey side. Not only do you have to pay for the pizza itself, but you have to pay for each topping you want to put on. So for a personal pizza (probably 12\" in diameter) was at least $14, again depending on what you want on it.  Other than that, I really enjoyed dining at this place. The ambiance was great and the staff here are amazing!!"}
{"text":"still a big fan, wonderful pizza!!! -- Remember to join their birthday club!!!-"}
{"text":"After a non-typical Grimaldi's experience, the manager tracked me down from my yelp review and sent us a gift card. My family and I returned to celebrate a birthday and we were all blown away. COMPLETE turn around from our first experience. Our waitress, Sara was attentive, quick, and friendly. Our food came out quickly, fresh and delicious! I appreciate the initiative that was taken by the manager to ensure a second visit back and we will FOR SURE be back to this location again! YUM!"}
{"text":"First timers place was really nice  White pizza with garlic, mushrooms and spinach White sangria  Toffee cheesecake"}
{"text":"Had an overall great experience here! The service was prompt and friendly and the atmosphere was really cool. We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the jazz tunes they had playing while eating our delicious pizza. We ordered the \"Garden\" pizza and added sausage and pepperoni. It was to die for."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get here. It's incredible. I've been to the original in New York and this is as good.   The pizza will simply blow your mind. I recommend the pepperoni. Plenty of room for large groups too."}
{"text":"Tucked in the back/upstairs part of the Palazzo, this is a can't miss for pizza lovers. It is a bit different than it's original big brother in Brooklyn, but the ingredients taste just as quality."}
{"text":"I legitimately dream about Grimaldi's Pizza, it's that good. I grew up in the land of NY pizza and this tastes just like my childhood. I always recommend this place!"}
{"text":"WOW this was good pizza! I actually live in Manhattan but have never been to the Brooklyn Grimaldi's (for shame!) so cannot comment on authenticity but gosh this was good pizza. I can attest that it is New York style, with thin crust, but the slices aren't so big that you have to fold them in half (as we do in NY). My boyfriend and I each got a personal size pizza since we couldn't agree and that worked out best- we probably took 2-3 slices home in a box that was breakfast the next day! I got the white and garlic pizza, and he got regular cheese with sausage- all so delicious! He wanted to get the cheesecake dessert but the service was a bit slow that we decided to just get out of there to walk around Old Town. But cool fountain and we enjoyed dining in the courtyard under the pretty lights! Definitely the most romantic pizza joint I've dined at~ hoping to return!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is my favorite pizza place in town. I prefer the Rainbow location because it is closer to my home, but before that one opened we would frequent the Eastern location. Food is just as good and they have great service. Our favorite pizza is the pepperoni well-done and we usually pair that with a side salad and some Blue Moon. You can't really go wrong with any of the food here."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is my all-time favorite pizza in town. Due Forni almost stole my heart a couple months back, but I always return to my first love. My girl introduced me to this place when we first started dating and I've been hooked ever since. We usually get the pepperoni well-done with a side salad to share, but you can't really go wrong with any of the food here. If you're a sports lover like me, make sure you get a chair facing the bar to catch a game or two while enjoying a Blue Moon and some delicious pizza pie."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was working late one Friday night so I had to fend for myself for dinner. Browsing through my bookmarks I came across Grimaldi's. It's basically a stones throw from my place, and I had heard good things, so off I went.  A couple ladies greeted me when I entered and directed me to the to-go area which is at the end of the bar. I decided to try a small pizza which is 16in, and added pepperoni, tomatoes, mushrooms and garlic. The small pizza is $14 which is just crust and cheese, and any additional toppings are $2-4 depending on what you get . My total for the pizza was $25! A bit on the pricey side. The cashier told me it would be about 20 minutes so I sat at the bar and grabbed a beer. I was disappointed they didn't have any beer specials, but I ordered a small blue moon for $5.   So 20 minutes goes by and the pizza comes out and it looks pretty good. I get home and dig in and it is just okay. I think I would have preferred it to be a little bit more well done, as my pizza was very flimsy and the toppings were a tad under cooked. Also there was hardly any cheese. I did like the crust which was thin, but not cracker thin and it had some chewiness which I enjoyed. I don't really get the hype here. It was good but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"I was so elated to see it's exactly the way I love it without standing in line!!! Had THE DON for the first time and loved it so much!!! Ellen gave me garlic powder and a shaker of oregano!! Also had the original magherita!! So yumm!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and everything was Awesome.  We got a free birthday pizza and a complimentary slice of caramel coconut cheesecake because it was our first time here.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Delicious, solid choice if you're craving pizza during your Vegas trip! It's located inside the Palazzo Hotel.   My husband and I shared a regular pizza with artichokes, garlic, basil, and sundried tomatoes. It was delicious and I absolutely loved the crust on the pizza!! It had that great oven-toasted taste and the perfect chewiness! We also got the Spinach Salad which came with bacon, red onions, cherry tomatoes, gorgonzola, and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was pretty good, tasted fresh and went well with our pizza. I haven't tried the original Grimaldi's in New York but I'm a fan based on my experience here. I would definitely try out their other locations if I'm craving pizza. They also have a white sauce base and pesto base for their pizzas which sounds unique! Definitely wanna try that someday!  Service was okay. we were being served by a girl who was in training. I felt pretty bad for her because she was obviously nervous but I give her props for trying hard and for smiling!"}
{"text":"I've eaten an both this location and their Scottsdale location as well. I'm always happy with their food and drinks. Service is great."}
{"text":"Having lived in Chicago for most of my life I was more than nervous of what an Arizona pizza experience would be like. For the most part my assumptions were correct - but Grimaldi's is great! We get the margarita pizza and it's amazing. I'm normally a deep dish pizza person but Grimaldi's is slowly winning me over for thin crust. Also, this place has amazing cheesecake - the best I've ever had in a restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this a three out of five solely because of the price that you pay for the pizza and salad. The salad is big enough for two people which we did not know that until after we got a Caesar salad and a house salad. We also ordered a personal size pizza because we weren't that hungry, so My husband and I thought we would share a personal size pizza which had six slices on there and we each ordered a salad. The pizza actually was really great we ordered a Don pizza with added spicy chicken and mushrooms on it. The pizza had mozzarella marinara sauce, spicy sausage,  meat balls and pepperoni.  The pizza is served thin slice with a thin layer marinara and very little mozzarella cheese. The meatballs are nice size pieces and the spicy chicken and sausage are definitely spicy. I actually enjoyed this pizza because of the taste.  Now the price for a personal size pizza which is about the size of a dinner plate maybe slightly larger starts off about $18, then you. Can add additional toppings for anywhere between three and four dollars per topping. Most people like myself can't just have the toppings that normally come on the pizza, you always want to add additional items so once we were done eating and the bill came for one personal size pizza and two salads the bill was $60. That is crazy for the cost of pizza for lunch and a dinner salad. Pricewise I felt that should've been around maybe $30."}
{"text":"As I just finished a somewhat negative review on my recent visit to the Scottsdale Quarter location, I feel compelled to post a counterbalancing review for the Old Town one. Time and time again, I find Grimaldi's to be our standby pizza joint: perfect thin-but-chewy crust, topped with just the right amount of sauce and ingredients such that we can leave there having pigged out and yet feeling merely comfortably full. The house salad is simple yet perfect starter to lead in to the main event. Also, we are always able to get seated right away, thanks to people's inexplicable aversion to being sitting at the plentiful and generously sized high-top tables right through the front door.   Which leaves me with my only suggestion: please ensure that the new SQ location is putting out the same quality product! I hope the oven crew gets a handle on getting the crusts right eventually."}
{"text":"We arrived at 7:00, had a party of six, and were able to be seated within 15 minutes. Fabulous, considering the number of hungry people coming into the restaurant that evening, but we have always had good luck getting right into Grimaldi's, regardless of the location.  The new Scottsdale Quarter location has great ambience and service going for it, but I was sorely disappointed by the quality of the pizza. One of the reasons my partner and I keep going back to the Old Town location is for the consistently tasty crust: crisp and thin, yet chewy and moist as well. Our pizza last night had a thicker crust and too well done, by comparison. Maybe the QC will improve as time goes on--I'm sure we'll be back to see."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever and they didn't even have ranch for my 10 yr old and waitress continued to laugh about it very unprofessional"}
{"text":"Good pizza not expensive for \"Vegas\" the large Calzone is basically a 16\" pizza folded in half! Don Vito pizza is the best choice for meat lovers."}
{"text":"pretty good pizza, didn't impress too much. I was expecting big things from the \"world famous\" cannoli which was just decent. Overall though it is very reasonably priced and you will get good value for the food."}
{"text":"I've never been wow'd by pizza but we were at the Palazzo and we wanted to try Grimaldi's.  Grimaldi's has a reputation of being great pizza and located in the mecca of thin crust pizza. Grimaldi's serves coal fire brick oven pizza and known for freshness including handmade mozzarella.  Located at the northern portion of the Palazzo, the restaurant was a bit dead with very few customers in the late afternoon. There was only two of us so I ordered a 16\" pizza. Pizza comes in 3 sizes and comes with red, white, or pesto sauce. For toppings, we decided to have pepperoni, meatballs, Italian sausage, and bacon.  The pizza came out piping hot. Overall, the pizza was good but not great by any means. You can definately taste the freshness of the mozarella, the good flavor of the sauce, and the quality of the meats were very good.  For two, we ate about 3/4 the pizza. Just the right serving which would be better for 3 since we overate some slices. Overall, service was just okay. Pizza was good but by no means wow'd me."}
{"text":"Keep coming back to this place again and again! I have always experienced exceptional service. In addition to that this is my favorite pizza in town! I have tried all kinds from super cheap pizza to pricey. I'm not a person who writes reviews but I believe this place deserves it."}
{"text":"Wow... I have had many pizzas in this town and the pizza at this location was delish!  We had a personal pizza with pepperoni/ricotta and a personal calzone with meatball/pepperoni both were great.  My only regret was not taking the photos to share... it was gone by the time we thought about it.  We will be back!  P.S. get crowded quick so go early."}
{"text":"First of all this review could of been bad, but it wont be. Today, Oct 4th the pizza oven got to hot, so to make a long story short, pizzas were taking well over an hour. Oven was completely down as they were trying to cool it. My husband and i were annoyed, but we had no where else to be,  plus my hunny just kept drinking beer and was watching the Wildcard  baseball  game. As this was going on, the staff kept apologizing,  gave us countless orders of free bread, gave my husband a free beer, all because we were waiting patiently. 4 tables left that I counted because everyone was pissed. Well after a while oven was working and everyone including the manager busted ass and got all the pizzas out. We got ours and it tasted great. Oh and did I mention we also scored a free medium pepperoni because a table had left and they asked us if we wanted it, were like yeah!! So for others there nite might have been ruined but not for us and thank you grimaldis for taking care of us old faithfuls."}
{"text":"Seriously just as good as the one under the Brooklyn bridge! I'm not kidding. When I want pizza in Vegas you better believe I am coming here! Get the margherita and the other one we had was some sort of meat lovers, I know it had meatballs on it and they were delicious. We also bad a veggie pizza a Cesar and a house salad, all very good. Service was great. Prices were decent since we split the total between our entire party. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The pizzas we ordered were amazing...one white pizza and one traditional with basil and tomatoes. Both were perfectly cooked and brought to us by a very friendly wait staff. I will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars because of the service. Okay servers just because your tips aren't pool doesn't mean you can treat the tables you're not serving horribly. Giolani or whatever his name is was the older server who looked he hated his life. When I asked him if he could reheat my pizza because it was cold, he just looked at me, kept walking, and shook his head yes. Waited another 5 minutes for him to come back and never saw him again.   So the FOOD...  we ordered the mediterranean salad which was delish! We ordered a large between two people and ate it all just fine with no struggle. I loved the sauce they used because it was your normal vinaigrette but it had a nice tangy sour kick to it!   Finally after 20 minutes we received the pizza because they had to clean the ovens in the middle of the day. It was only warm. I don't about you but I love my pizza burning the roof of my mouth when I take my first bite. By the time i went for my second slice it was cold."}
{"text":"Service was great and salad was good but pizza wasn't as amazing as I expected it didn't live up to the hype for my boyfriend and I :/"}
{"text":"Food is good unfortunately kitchen does not have it together ... Expect 1.5 hour wait after ordering for pizza ... They blame it on the fact they are busy but every time I come in they are equally as busy .. Kitchen and manager need to get together ....they are a huge chain you would think they would have it together .."}
{"text":"very good pizza--exceptional crust. Somewhat over-priced--i will assume this is mostly attributable to its location--and the abundance of 0.1%ers who live near it."}
{"text":"\"(Closest thing to) Perfect\" by Jermaine Jackson.   ...and perfect is what this pizza was, to me. Way better than that place in Warrenville, IL  Simply put: get \"The Don\" and wash it down w/a Four Peaks: Kilt Lifter.  You'll thank me later :-)  Tell them \"Jay\" sent ya........on second thought, don't do that (was feeling too good about myself, but that is what this pizza will do to ya!)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the place was sold or what but it has really gone downhill. Pizza is still good but the service is terrible. Not sure I'll go back to what was my favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"A few years back and before this place popped up in Old Town, I spent a week in New York City.  Having studied my trusty Fodor's guide (pre-Yelp era, of course), I knew that one of the most well-regarded pizza dinners awaited me under the Brooklyn Bridge on Old Fulton St.  Walking there, my friends and I met a lonely drifter who followed behind the group, promising not to stab us.  He just wanted some company.  We found Grimaldi's, said goodbye to our shady new friend, and had a delicious meal.  At the time, I didn't know if I really enjoyed the food or I just really enjoyed that I was eating it under the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City.  I just knew that the restaurant found itself near the top of my \"things to tell my friends back home about my trip even though they are just nodding politely waiting for me to finish\" list.  Less than a year later, I'm driving down Scottsdale Road and I see the sign.  No way!  The same Grimaldi's?!  My girlfriend and I had to try it again.  Same result.  Delicious brick-oven pizza.  Great atmosphere.  Great wine list.  Another time, I went there for my birthday and they put our group in the \"Patsy Room.\"  If you want a quieter and more separated dining experience, ask about it.  I thought it was nice.  There are some other locations around town, but this one is my favorite."}
{"text":"came back here again over the 4th of July weekend and I must say. they don't disappoint!!! we ordered 2 large pizzas again for 5 people and we devoured it!  our first pizza had pepperoni sausage and jalapeños. be warned the jalapeños are SPICY!!!  our second was chicken Italian sausage and mushroom. it was alright. the chicken was just ok. I enjoyed the other pizza a lot more.   overall I was very pleased with the quality of the pizza. thin crust and the toppings never fell off when you picked it up to eat. this is definitely our new go to place every time we go to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on giving them 3 or 4 stars but I will be generous. I have been to the El Segundo, CA location and went here to take my in laws to experience the pizza goodness.   FOOD: Pizza was awesome as usual, ordered large pepperoni with red sauce and a small white pizza with meatballs. The crust is thin and has that delicious brick oven taste. the perfect slice to fold in half and eat New York style.   SERVICE: Our server was nice but wasn't helpful in order recommendations or menu education. Wished my in laws could have gotten the first experience that we did at another Grimaldi's Location.   HIGHLIGHTS: white pizza is my favorite, can't go wrong with the toppings. It's just extra cheese with garlic and olive oil, no sauce.  Order a carafe of wine, the house chianti is great!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6 people around 6:30pm on Tuesday night and the place was already pretty packed. Luckily there were a couple of open tables for us, since we didn't have a reservation, which I would recommend if you don't get there early because the line of people waiting for tables got longer and longer while we were there enjoying our meal. In fact when we left around 8pm, there was still a line.  We started with your standard pepperoni and sausage pizza, and then we ordered a specialty white pizza (I can't remember the name), which is supposed to taste like a cheese steak. I liked the pepperoni and sausage pizza better than the specialty one. Although it did taste pretty good, I think that there was way too much cheese on top and it made the pizza taste a little dry and marshmallow-y.  After finishing two large pizzas, it still was not enough. So we ordered a pesto pizza with chicken and garlic. This pizza tasted really good and had tons of chicken on it and maybe just a little too much pesto. The pizzas here are thin crust, and it's a lot easier to fold each slice to eat it. I really liked that there was a bit of a crunch to the crust.  So our waitress was a little too anxious to clear our plates. I think this might be because they were so busy and probably wanted to try to clear the tables quicker so they could seat the people waiting for a table. She did check up on us often to make sure we had enough food and that everything was ok.   Now here is where the 5 stars comes in. One of the guys in our group couldn't finish his slice of pizza, so he asked her to box it up for him. As we were about to leave, he asked her if she had the pizza. When she went back to the kitchen to get it, apparently someone had thrown it out instead of boxing it up for our friend. She informed the manager about what happened and the manager offered to either make a personal size pizza for our friend, or give us a complimentary slice of cheesecake.  Of course we took the cheesecake and got the plain cheesecake with raspberry sauce and it was heavenly!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Our waitress (blonde) on Thurs 7/6 working the bar was fantastic. Our 1st time here and I will be back. Kudos!!"}
{"text":"I love this place I've been here multiple times!! Tuesday's are the best half off of the bottle of wine or can't get any better our server Nick was just great and the manager lady is just amazing. We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best calzone I have ever eaten! Had a sausage, pepperoni, bacon and jalapeño 12\" calzone. Not sure what cheeses are in it but it's ridiculously awesome. That is all."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and friendly staff. NY style pizza has finally made its way to vegas. The pizza was a bit overpriced but well worth it. We had a veggie pizza and a pepperoni pizza with meatballs and ricotta cheese. Both of them had great flavor. The place was packed and reminded me of a sports bar. The alfredo pasta was legit as well and highly recommended. They are open late which is always a plus and the restaurant was very clean. They also have curb side service which is unique for a NY style pizza spot. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This is a must stop in Vegas. Had Grimaldis in Brooklyn and Hoboken and this spot is great coz there are no lines and better interiors with the same delicious pizza! You can't go wrong with Grimaldis. Caesar salad, pepperoni pizza and a good red!!! Wish I made room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Perfection!  I love New York style pizza, and I love woodfire pizza.  This is their gorgeous love child.  Ambiance is much more casual than I'd expected.  Red and white checkered table cloths, menu is the paper placemat, etc.  It was packed by 6pm, and I can see why!  Great wine selection with fair prices.  Pizza choices are ample without being overwhelming.  Why can't a place like this exist in Chicago??"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that wasn't too pricey to grab a quick dinner and it turns out the place was perfect. The salad portions are enough to feed 4, even though they say 2 and the four of us split a huge pizza. Everything was delicious! I will definitely be back here when I come back to visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"\"Gotta be a 5\" Why a 5? The pizza is excellent. Thin and crispy. The wine list is good and well priced for a change. Good location in the vinietian / palazzo"}
{"text":"Coming out of a later movie in Glendale the other night, we decided to look for a place to eat nearby.  Whipped out the smartphone, set the setting to YELP, and the tractor beam locked onto Grimaldi's nearby.  Off we went at warp speed.  At the time of arrival, which was later dinnertime, there was no wait.  We got a table and had to hop up on the chairs to sit there.  Looking around, I enjoyed the whimsy of the decor, with what appeared as wine bottles with their bottoms cut off as hanging lights, different NYC Subway signs, some b&w classic NYC scenes, and the cooks nearby, twirling the pizza dough.  The menu is clearly focused on the pies, with basically just a few appetizers and salads for other items.  We ordered a Caesar salad to start.  The plate and salad were nice and chilled, with the dressing having a slight lemon taste; it was light, not a hearty Caesar dressing, but enjoyable.  The presentation of the pizza is as they should be: a stand to give it the respect it deserves, and served on a platter with a serving utensil (unlike many places that just expect you to use your own fork or knife--barbarians!)  Ours was a large, thin crust cheese pizza with fresh tomatoes and kalamata olives.  The tomatoes were perfectly cut and distributed--it looked like a pepperoni pizza.  The olives stood out, very nice flavor with a salty kick--these were the good ones and not overcooked!  Although I did order a pie with sauce, I didn't really notice it...maybe they didn't use much.  I hope to return and try that again.  Though there was plenty to fill us up and take a few pieces home, we decided to save room for dessert and ordered the tiramisu, which is always interesting to see how each place interprets it.  We found they don't make their own (though they do make their own cheesecakes), but it was excellent: very moist and flavorful.  Our service was great: the waitress came over several times to see how we were doing and someone else came by towards the end to see if we had a good experience.  Of course, it also wasn't the rush hour, so that helped.  I hope to make it back to this or another of their locations, as it has great thin crust pizza WITHOUT a huge wait.  Beam me back, Scotty!"}
{"text":"I had reviewed another Grimaldi's in Peoria and happened to find myself in Old Scottsdale, looking for a good place to eat.  Lucky for me, Grimaldi's was there.    The wait was said to be up to 25 minutes, but for an outside table, they took my wife and me right away.  Firing up the propane heaters kept the bite out of the air.  To get to the point, this Grimaldi's did not disappoint either.  I think one of the standout qualities of their pies is the quality of the crust.  Of all the pizza spots in the Valley so far, none have really stood up to the \"can you eat it without drooping\" test.  Which is to say, with a couple of toppings, do you have to fold it to get it to your mouth without flopping over, or do you absolutely need a knife and fork to cut it up?  Grimaldi's pizza needs neither.  The crust, very tasty from the coal-fired oven, is crispy enough to pick up without need to hold it with two hands, and it holds the toppings well.  It's not greasy or drippy or any of that.  And when you take home any leftovers, the crust is still firm.  To me, that is the mark of great crust.    The toppings are flavorful, too.  This time, succulent sun-dried tomatoes, fresh garlic, and tasty artichokes shared the top of the pie with fresh white mozzarella.  The sauce is subtle but there.  I also ordered their Mediterranean salad, pretty much a standard Greek salad with lots of Romaine lettuce.  Cool and crisp, when they say a small size can be split by two, they are correct: the bowl looks small but it is deep.  I did split a large as I was hungry, but we did take home some of the salad and pizza.  Again we got the tiramisu, not made by them, but nevertheless melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  Service was great: despite being very busy, our waitress checked on us several times and was very friendly."}
{"text":"I had a pizza with tomato, onion, fresh garlic and fresh basil it was good. The only thing I wish they would have is spinach and my sauce on the pizza."}
{"text":"Oh, so delicious! Quality and service just like the one in Tucson.  What else can I say?  This time around I had the pesto with grilled chicken, and the dot had cheese pizza no sauce.  There really is not much to say that hasn't been said. AWESOME"}
{"text":"Grimaldis is my favorite Pizza joint in Las Vegas.  All ingredients used at this restaurant are always super fresh.  Heres what I have had:  Sausage and Onions pizza with red sauce- very good Chicken and Mushroom pizza with pesto sauce- amazing- my fav Caesar salad- very good/ very fresh Caprese Salad- very good/very fresh  Grimaldis uses a brick over pizza and the crust is always baked to perfection.  They have several outlets in arizona, nevada, etc.  If you see one, you must go in and try it out..............................."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's in Vegas? Much closer than NY =)  We got half red and half white with italian sausage and mushrooms. Love the thin crust! My favorite was the white pizza because the garlic really brought out the flavors. The italian sausage reminded me more of mini meatballs than actual sausage.   Just a note, the \"Personal\" pizza is quite large. It's actually six decent sized slices from the usual 4 mini slices that I've seen at other pizza joints. It made a good light lunch for two.   This isn't one of those cheap $2 a slice pizza joints. Come here for a good NY style pizza. Can't wait to come back and try something else."}
{"text":"This is my all time FAVORITE restaurant! The employees are wonderful, especially the bartender Ray, and the servers Bryna and Amanda. I have been coming for years and usually sit at the bar with a glass of wine and a personal pizza or a salad. I come here often because I feel so welcome, and the food and service is always consistent."}
{"text":"Just like Shake Shack, you must go here.   AZ doesn't have the NY water which definitely you can tell in the crust, but amazing pizza and super nice area with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating in Easter Sunday lunch.   The Don is really tasty, the meatballs are solid.  The Margherita has the right balance of the sauce and cheese and basil.  Truly the closest thing to getting it in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in vegas!! It's super yummy food and a great atmosphere!! I go here every chance I get!!"}
{"text":"I'm a frequenter of Sambalatte, so I've seen Grimaldi's quite a few times and so I knew I wanted to try i. A friend also said she had tried their Henderson location and liked it - so we ended up trying this location.   I did enjoy the pizza. Crust was great, thin and crispy just the way I like it. Was it worth the price though? I wouldn't say so. We added the sausage($2), mushrooms($2), & roasted red peppers($4) to the pizza. Pretty expensive for toppings in my opinion... especially the red peppers. I was surprised they cost more than the sausage.   Now, I'm not sure if it was because we were siting outside, where it was a bit chilly - or if it was the pizza - but after about 4 or 5 minutes, the pizza was cold. And, I'm not a big fan of cold pizza.  Service wise, it was decent service. Our server was friendly, but maybe a little too friendly. She took it upon herself to look at my friends iPhone, where she saw she had received a text message, and then proceeded to 'pretend' to unlock it. Now, I don't know about some of you... but I don't prefer to have strangers touch my phone... let alone try and read my text messages."}
{"text":"10 minutes wait for me for having to stand up and go to get myself a beer at the bar?...short staffed on 02/17/13 around 5-6pm.  manager completely involved in expediting.....nobody came for 10 minutes to say  hi, to offer water, to bring some bread....no acknledgement whatsoever....after 5 more minutes I decided to leave the place with my wife and the two kids......had to go to the bartender (who was also attending tables?!!!!!!!!) and ask for a refund....when asked if I wanted to leave my number/email......are you kidding?....ever ever again.....and guess what....with 80 employees at the Palazzo where we order weekly for 80 employees......you will never see my business again....next time....next to the sign at the entrance...where you signal that you use \"everify\";...meaning....you don't hire illegal inmigrants.....put a sign that reads....\"you will be e-ignored\" if attempting to order a pizza.....you know when I noticed the whole thing was going bad....when the table next to us....was half through with the salad...when the server brought the first beer.  good luck with your business endeavors!"}
{"text":"The best pizza we ever had.   Outstanding service.  We'll be back.  And we can't wait till they open one nearer us."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and seated right away. We shared a small Caesar salad and 16\" Pizza Margherita which was plenty of food for two. Reasonable prices and good food. Would come back."}
{"text":"This is our go to favorite take out pizza place! We love it! Our favorite is pepperoni , sausage, basil & fresh tomatoes! Their always quick and delicious !                   We've dined there a few times . Its beautiful out on the patio! We actually watched a wedding from there once! Service is excellent too"}
{"text":"Its so hard to beat Grimaldis thin crust pizza.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! We always get sausage pepperoni fresh basil fresh tomatoes cooked on it. That's our favorite and that's what we always get! it's amazing! The service is great! we usually get takeout and  have been there more than a few times it's a nice cozy atmosphere. I have had a few salads there and they're always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing calzone went above an beyond with the service and the food!!! Manger and all service people would check on me and bring everything before I could even ask! a must if you are near this place!"}
{"text":"Our waiter asked if had ever been, we said no, and he said welcome to your new favorite pizza place.  holy crap, THE BEST THE BEST THE BEST This coming from someone who likes(... liked?) deep dish, grim serves east coast which is thin but the great thing about that is you can eat more! 3 of us polished a large, down to the last piece of chicken on the pan. The pies are cooked pretty hot so the crust is crunchy and delicious.  Its kinda expensive for the toppings though, i think the large was 15, but then you add each topping for about 2-6 dollars i think, the chicken was 5 i remember. We also got meatball. Fantastic.   Reminded me a lot of Chicago Brewing BUT SO MUCH BETTER. Its rather small on the inside but still looks classy, of course its boca park. Classic red and white checker tablecloths and a bar up front, BUT NO TVs which i actually liked here. Walls decorated with normal new york / italian gear. Didnt see anything yankee which was funny, its like they dont want to be a sports bar (for which i would go to gordon anyway) but they are big on wines, and in a very italian restaurant fashion wine glasses are waiting on the tables for you  Will have to try dessert next time we didnt even look. We did get a caprese salad to start which was very elegant, but to me it was a waste of 7 bucks for cheese and tomato.   All i could say while eating was \"this is freaking good!\"  Uploading a picture of their lighting, its emptied out wine bottles hanging from the ceiling, almost didnt notice these gems!  5 STARS for food and not being snooty, but it is clean and new so dress up a lil, makes you feel better anyway     EDIT!! idk how i could have forgotten to mention this. I came in alone and asked for a table for 3, the 2 hostesses kinda looked at me and i explained that an old man and little girl would be joining me. One asked if she needed to bring a booster seat. The funny part is the 'little girl' is my 20 yr old sister so I awkwardly let them know she wasn't a 'little girl' but rather my little sister, who happens to be very short... haha, and will always be little to me ;)"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this Grimaldi's for a few year's now. Let me start off with that I have actually eaten at the original Grimaldi's when I worked for a pizza magazine. And after eating at MANY of the so-called best pizza places in Las Vegas, I have to say that Grimaldi's is by far the best in town.   Food - I simply love their pizza. The sauce and dough are fantastic and super yummy thin. You can tell it's been fired in a wood burning oven and comes out perfect every time. My favorite salad has to be their spinach. A few times the cooks have gotten a tad heavy handed with the dressing but I don't knock the whole place for that. I've learned that it's best to get the dressing on the side and immediately put half of everything in a box. I just can't eat all that salad AND all that pizza but I'd rather finish the pizza and have salad for lunch the next day.  It is a fairly small menu so if you're hoping for tons of apps and such to choose from then you might need to look elsewhere.   Wine - I really like their wine list. I also get a nice Zinfandel blend (Red people) that is only $15 for a half carafe. That's super cheap and maybe even half a glass more than I NEED.   Service - I have to say I always get amazing service here. I usually sit at the bar but a few times I've sat at a table and never once need anything. Everyone is always super friendly but doesn't bug you if you're trying to just chill out.   ***The ONLY negative thing I can say about this place is some specialty pizza I got talked into once. It was a Buffalo Chicken Wing pizza that I knew sounded off but wanted to do something different so I went for it. Good grief those flavors were just too much for a thin pizza. Between the Frank's Red Hot and Gorgonzola it was just too salty and heavy. If they had done something to add some coolness it could have worked***"}
{"text":"Good enough....I'm really picky! The best this time Marcus on it!! Food better and fresher than ever...best I've had in Vegas top notch!!!"}
{"text":"It's Italian it's pizza it's even a fancy bar. What do you expect for a spectacular pizza place in Scottsdale? Great place for a date, family gathering or even a drink at the bar... You'll be pleasently surprised here. Say hello to my little friend ..."}
{"text":"The pizza here was delicious! I got a personal pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. Everything tasted fresh, the sauce was great, the dough was thin but flavorful and the cheese seemed and tasted like a high quality mozzarella. I enjoyed the dining room set up as well. We sat close the the oven and watched them spinning and tossing pizza. The wine selection was good as well. We opted for a lower end bottle($21) and were pleasantly surprised when it was good(it was Stella Merlot). To top everything off, our waitress was on point as well. All in all, this place was awesome! Give them a try if you haven't already"}
{"text":"Great experience. From the moment my friend and I walked in we were greeted with a smile. We didn't have to wait long for a table. We ordered a 12\" margarita pizza and a Greek salad which we shared. Yes the small salad is perfect for two possibly for three. The pizza is definitely just for two people it's about six slices medium slices not to small just perfect. Our salad arrived right away and our pizza right after that. Service was fast. The restaurant was really clean and cold and it smelled like fresh pizza was being made. I really enjoyed it. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"We went here for a Birthday celebration. My family had rave reviews of this place and especially there food, and they were right! The food was fabulous, pizzas were fresh and tasty. The salads were great with wonderful ingredients. The only thing was the service, I wouldn't say it was horrible but it was definitly LAZY. The server needed more training and not even the manager or other co workers would help bus the table. We were served dessert and coffee with piles of dirty dinner plates still on the table. All in all...Food = A, Service = D"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's pizza is very good. Not spectacular, but they have a great crust. I find the sauce a tad sweet. The Caesar salad is delicious. Great service and awesome rewards program and birthday deals. I love the white pie."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas this weekend and tried out this pizzeria. The antipasto, Caesar salad, and pizzas were delicious! If you like thin crust pizza this is your place! Great portions! Great service! I would give them 5 stars if they had a few more appetizers!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go to Grimaldi's but when I do I am never disappointed.  I usually go around my birthday when I get the free $20 for a one topping large pizza.  This time we decided to apply that $20 to a specialty pizza and ordered the Don with onions.  It was a great selection and plenty of food for my father and I.  We sipped on some beers on their nice patio and enjoyed the perfect fall weather.  The food is always good, the service is always good, and atmosphere is always good but the prices could be lower.  I guess the prices don't really matter since I only go when I get my birthday coupon but maybe that is what is keeping me from going more often."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this pizza place while in Arizona for an Incubus concert. My boyfriend being the huge pizza fan he is was looking in to eating here. So obviously we went! Im ok with pizza not a huge fan.. but this pizza was absolutely perfect! I loved it and he did too of course. We got a small pizza (Perfect size for 2-3 people) with 4 toppings redsauce. Our toppings were pepperoni, mushroom, black olives, and ham. It was a little pricey.. but worth it. Too bad they dont have this place where I live lol. Perfect for a date night (dim lighting & wine) and a walk by the canal."}
{"text":"went back again last night.....ordered our usual 2 salads and pizza.....salads came out just fine, but then the waiting began for the pizza...we waited and waited.....and waited....finally the manager walked over and told us that he was having them re-make our pizza because...surprise surprise.....he saw that we had ordered LIGHT jalapenos and in fact they had put a full order!! anyone who reads my above review will get the annoyance in this....so we waited some more.....finally after about another 20 minutes the pizza finally came....it was so burned!! but by that point we were sick of waiting so we took it home with us...which i regretted upon tasting it and realizing how burned it was..........arrrrrg"}
{"text":"Sloooowww... we called in a to go order and were told 35-40 minutes and it ended up taking well over an hour. The pizza was pretty good, but the wait kinda ruined it. I understand it was a busy Friday but they need to either get their act together, or stop selling to go orders when they can't handle them."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Came here for my little sister's family graduation party and wow! If you want authentic pizza this is the joint you're looking for. Excellent service with a polite waitstaff (even though it was busy) and everyone gets a pizza, table gets super crowded. It's pretty cool being able to see all the cooking going on and they make it fun. Not much more to say really, a must go for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the few good pizza places truly here in Vegas, great location service and food. Everything turned out very well and in contrast to California pizza kitchen which is strangely close, this is just traditional Italian pizza but both are good."}
{"text":"New to the area and decided to give Gremaldi's a try, what a huge disappointment!! I am always a fan of thin crust & especially love brick oven pizza so I was pretty let down with just how bad the food really was. The pizza was so unbelievably bland that i contemplated either putting salt on it or dumping parmesan cheese all over it. Even with toppings it was still by far the worst pizza I've ever eaten. There are no appetizers, just salads for starters. I was hoping for bread of some kind to go with my pizza, that was not part of the menu either. It's pizza & salad, that's it.  The atmosphere was okay, pretty loud but their were large parties. Decor was pleasant but our waiter was very pushy & made us feel that we were being rushed. I have had better frozen pizzas... Save your money & go down the street to the pizza & gelato spot."}
{"text":"I believe it says a lot when I say I don't even like thin crust pizza but I Love this place! The pepperoni is absolutely delicious. The cheese is so good. And the sauce is not too much or overwhelming like others can be. Fun place to go out at night."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to see what all the hype was about. Recently there  was a fiery discussion on the NextDoor app. about who makes the BEST NY style pizza in the the area. ( Mesa, Gilbert, Chandler, Phoenix,Tempe Scottsdale) Grimaldi's was the Pizzeria of choice. Being an easterner from NY tristate area I have a very discerning tongue and have struggled to discover palatable pizza in Arizona.  Thus far it appears Zonies are not foodies, and can eat everything and anything that would make a Billy Goat puke, and say \" How Awesome!\"  Grimaldi's is a very attractive family style restaurant. The ambiance was not too loud and not too crowded like some popular restaurants. Our waiter was top notch. He was cordial and prompt at taking our orders and attending to our needs. He gets a solid A for customer service.  We split a Caesar salad which tasted OK for the price. I have had better. We ordered an 18\" Pie with fresh Roma tomatoes , mushrooms and anchovies. When delivered it looked awesome. Baked well without burned crust edges, and the cheese seems adequately melted. The taste was a whole different story. Beneath the cheese was a meager amount of tomato paste base which tasted more like Campbells tomato soup. The cheese was flavorless ricotta. The add on ingredients were as ordered and did add flavor, thank God!  Unfortunately once the pie cooled down the crust got super soggy like wet toilet paper, therefore making it unmanageable to eat. Each slice we tried to keep an open mind in hopes of finding a tastier bite. But it didn't happen. Not a good pizza at all!  Lesson learned. Pizza in Arizona is just not to be and never will be. Such a disappointment!  Time to book a trip to the \"Big Apple\" for the real deal."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this place for some time now. One of the first times I came there was a 45 minute wait which really deterred me from trying to come back. My brother and his wife came into town so we decide to make a reservation and go. It was a Saturday night and we got seated for our reservation pretty quickly. Our waiter immediately notified us that things were really busy and pizza would take over 30 minutes so we asked about appetizers. He said that everything gets cooked in the same oven and they don't use microwaves or friers. So we got some salad to start us off.  Luckily the pizza came and it was pretty good! We even followed it up with some cheesecake afterwards. The four cheese pizza was a little salty to our taste but it was good overall.  Our waiter was great. He checked in with us regularly and kept our drinks topped off.  You will most likely be parking on the side parking lot of Harkins Theatre. There are just a few spaces in front of the restaurant.   This is a cool place to try out. But they may need another oven so they can get food out faster."}
{"text":"In town with my daughter and we were looking for a good pizza for dinner.  This was really good.  I gave it 3 stars because the service was not great :-(  But we each had a salad (they were big enough we could have shared one) and we split a pizza.  It was all very good.  I think we have one in KC now so we'll have to check it out."}
{"text":"I had a pesto pizza and house salad and my boyfriend had a calzone with two toppings. Though I do like the smokiness of the pizza crust I thought it was just a little too thin and was a little irked that my pesto and cheese didn't stay on, as in the pesto cheese was completely separate and off of the crust. I found the cheese to be a little too chewy without being thick (I like chewy THICK cheese on pizza), but my boyfriend thought it was good, so to each his own. My boyfriend's calzone looked large but didn't really have that much inside of it. I thought the calzone crust was a little flat, like it needed to be a little more light and bready. My large house salad was nicely large (like with a couple slices of pizza you can make a meal). The location of this pizzeria is adorable at night (lots of lights).   I do have to say that if I'm getting pizza around here, I would rather get Barro's."}
{"text":"So I came here yesterday based on recommendations and reading fellow yelp reviews. I was not to be disappointed food wise. My friend Lyz and I split and Antipasto and a cheese pizza. The antipasto was great! Eight thick slices of mozzarella cheese, slices of salami, olives, roasted red peppers, and a basket of bread. My only complaint that I can overlook is that the peppers are served cold. It would've been better if they were hot. Just and oversight that I got over quickly, heh.  Then the pizza... Oh man was it good. A 16 inch thin crust pizza. That seems like a lot, but with thin crust pizza one person can definitely finish it. The dough was great. The bottom and the crusts was crispy and soft and chewy in the center. The sauce was definitely solid. Not too sweet and not too tangy, just right. The cheese was just right. The cheese placement was spot on. Not too much, and not too little. All around a damn good pizza.  I have to give props to my waiter as for he was spot on as well, with one minor slip up, which I'm not sure is his fault. My pizza and antipasto came out at the same time. Eh, oh well.  What didn't impress me was the inside of the restaurant. I know Grimaldi's has several locations, in several states and sort of a pseudo chain restaurant. It seems as though they could've designed the interior a lot more comparable to that of a New York pizza joint. The inside was kind of too new/bland at the same time if that makes any type of sense? Yeah they had some pictures of New York, but you definitely know that you are in AZ.  Oh before I forget I also had a cannoli, that was pretty damn solid if I must say. It wasn't the greatest one I have ever had, nor was it the worst. I would get it again for sure. Overall I will be back to Grimaldi's to stuff my face again, and a definite stop for anyone who has never been there!"}
{"text":"Good pizza! skip the salads etc...but enjoy the pizza.  They do a good job at this location."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this restaurant! Super yummy pizza, friendly staff and management! Way to go Grimaldis!"}
{"text":"(600th review...I figured it would be more glamorous, but then again pizza is always a great choice!)  Second time eating at Grimaldi's, but first time for me to have a proper sitdown experience!  Ironically enough, I basically had the same exact pizzas that I did the last time I ordered from Grimaldi's: (1) a pepperoni pizza and (2) my Italian sausage, meatball, and ricotta cheese pizza creation. It was absolutely fantastic when I had it the first time and just as good as the second time. And BTW, the \"small\" really ain't all that small when it's a 16\" pizza that's cut into six monster huge slices.  Service here was great, we were always attended to. Definitely would come back again."}
{"text":"Bout damn time I finally made my way to a Grimaldi's. Considering my fairly frequent visits to Las Vegas, I always figured I would make my first visit in Nevada. Nope..ended up here because it was literally right next to the client that I was making a visit to.  I've read all about the Grimaldi's vs. Juliana's rivalry that stems from Brooklyn and how the standards that were so prevalent at the OG Grimaldi's dipped due to expansion. Well, after having tried an original pepperoni pizza and my masterpiece of a white pizza creation (Italian sausage, meatball, and ricotta cheese), I must say that this Grimaldi's makes some pretty damn good pizza!  Ingredients were super fresh. The tomato sauce on the pepperoni pizza stood out as sweet and tangy. And the white pizza just goes so well with ricotta cheese all the time. Italian sausage and meatballs were the perfect blend as well.  Not quite ready to declare Grimaldi's the best pizza I've ever had...I've had some pretty damn good pizza over the years. But is definitely up there for me. Super happy with my order!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my pizza at grimaldies. Ordered meatball with pesto. I thought they overloaded the pesto but overall it was really good. Grimaldi's is one of the better pizza restaurants in Scottsdale. Four out of five stars."}
{"text":"Fantastic overall experience!  Great pizza, terrific environment and wonderful staff.  My wife and I like it so much we go about once every two weeks!  The location is easy and parking is simple.  The interior is clean and roomy.  The pizzas are fantastic.  We often split a small caeser salad with our personal size pizza.  Plenty of food!  We also order a side of anchovies for our salad and pizza. For a real treat, order one of their homemade cannoli's for dessert!  The staff are very pleasant and generally fun to be around.  They take good care of you and are there when you need them. Love going here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience there.  The review mentioning the Caprese salad were right.    Very generous portions.   The pizza had a lot of topping options and were all delicious.  If there was only one thing to pick from that I think could've been better, I personally like a crispier crunch / crust.  Still, that's not taking that much away from what I consider a good experience.   Also, any place that carries Fat Tire beer is gets bonus points right away."}
{"text":"For thin crust pizza, Grimaldi's is my first choice. I like the flavor of the crust, the various cheeses and the sauce choices. The ambiance is cool. I like that they offer crib service if I choose take out."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is an establishment with a large pedigree. One of the most lauded pizza joints in New York City, they appeared to have branched out - franchising 2 joints in Las Vegas  So, after much anticipation, my hubby and I bit the bullet and went for a piece of pie.  Meh. Really. The pizza was not as flavourful as what we expected. We had the marinara (tinned, pureed tomatoes) sauce with sausage, basil and onions. The lack of spice of the sauce and the sausage was  a total downer. The small amount of basil they did put on the pizza did nothing to detract from the overall blandness of the poor pie. Which was rather sad because the crust is one of the best we've tried.  We did go back to try Grimaldi's a second time - this time opting for a \"white\" sauce with meatball and onions. Still, the food was rather bland. Our server this time did bring us some dried oregano and garlic powder which we doused the poor slices with to give it some flavour.  Really, for the food alone, it does probably deserve maybe a three star rating. However the cost of the pizza detracted me from doing so."}
{"text":"My friend took me for her favorite pizza around the area. It was delicious with a crispy thin crust, right amount of sauce. My half had pepperoni and onion.  I would have preferred a few more onions for the $2.00 per topping but the pepperoni was generous.  The waitress was efficient and refilled my ice tea 3 x's without asking. The place wasn't busy so the pizza came quickly. My friend and I split the Carmel toffee cheesecake that was divine. I would recommend this place and will go again."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. They only serve thin crust but it's a nice soft dough with a crunchy crust. I've never sat in the dining room because they have a nice hi-top seating area in the bar. Less of a wait if you grab one of those and I actually like the atmosphere in the bar area better. It's a great place to stop for a bite before or after the free Art Walk on Thursday nights in Old Town.   Last time we were there they mentioned that they stoke their ovens (sounds kinky) from 4-5 pm daily, so nothing goes in the oven during that time.   They have specials on their wines on Tuesdays. I think they were half off."}
{"text":"If you want DELICIOUS SAVORING pizza, this is the right place for you. Every bite that I took was just remarkably tasty. The staff was VERY friendly, I definitely recommend this place for pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's was awesome as usual. We had a large and small calzone with pepperoni, meatball, sausage and ricotta. We also had a bottle of their house wine Millie Gradi which was delicious for the price. Our server Jamison was great. He had a great attitude and made a great dinner even better. Grimaldi's was a winner as usual."}
{"text":"We ate at Grimaldi's Pizzeria tonight. Their pizza was fantastic. WE look forward to Grimaldi's opening in the Los Angeles area."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is my all-time favorite place for pizza. My favorite would have to be the pesto pizza with pepperoni. Simple? I know. But the pesto is really tasty and their pepperoni isn't like many.  About the restaurant and the Grimaldi locations, I usually get seated immediately. Their servers are exceptionally very nice. They take good care of their customers and cater to their needs."}
{"text":"Tonight was the worst service!  My girlfriend and I went for pizza and drinks.  The waitress brought out my personal pizza and said my friends was coming but after 20 minutes, no food for my friend.  The manager then told us they burnt her pizza but another was coming in 10 minutes.  After we waited again, I asked for a box and where my friends pizza was now?  She said oh the second one burnt and I thought you were going to leave but your bill is all Taken care of?! Uh yeh well we were there an hour and only one of us got to eat!  Ridiculous"}
{"text":"This location is outstanding, the food is great, obviously. However what keeps me coming back is my favorite server Alex, her genuine smile and enthusiasm is a breathe of fresh air."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming here for a while now, the pizza is always great and the wine is fantastic. It is a great place to come for a date night or with friends, family and in-laws. It is not the cheapest pizza around but it is an upscale pizzeria and that's the reason we go. The menu is big and has something for everyone, it is a place to go out and have a great time at. I would recommend this Grimaldi's to everyone."}
{"text":"went to ate couple times and always had problem with the service.  was waited forever for the pizza and they mixed up by gave my pizza to other table, after the pizza cold and being touched with other customers the server trying to give it to us. seriously?? who wants that??! pizza was good but the service is horrible!"}
{"text":"Terrific....Definately New York Style pizza! Perfect density crust with a slight char. Tangy sauce. Slighty oily cheese and savory pepperoni.  We only had time for a quick pizza at the bar but will come back for more soon. The service was good and actually explained to us how Grimaldis Vegas replicates the NYC water they use to make dough in the Vegas restaurant.  I know if I were staying in Palazzo or Venetian I'd be ordering alot of pizza to be brought up!"}
{"text":"Only four stars because they don't deliver.  Pizza is great!  You can use two delivery apps though if you really don't want to pick up yourself."}
{"text":"Wow.  Talk about pizza.  This place lived up to the standards set by NYC.  The crust is chewy, thin, light, and the only thing making it \"thick\" is what you choose top it with.  We had a red pie, and a white pie...Both loaded up with tons of ingredients and flavors bursting our palettes.   Nice place to have in the middle of Las Vegas within the Canal Shops."}
{"text":"I was between 3 and 4 starts for a while.   But I'm a jerk and went with my heart which was saying 3 stars.   I decided to let the determining factor being value.   For the prices that they charge, you don't get too much.     I usually get the white pizza with garlic and add ricotta cheese.   Think it comes out to able $21.  It is a fairly quality pie.   Crust is solid, flavors are nice, but my beef is that after it stop being hot, the dough gets really tough, the cheese gets weird and it goes downhill faster than a wheelchair in San Francisco.   If you don't eat the pizza within like 15 mins, the pizza gets like 17 times worse.     The cesars salad is well dressed.  Something about it is just really good.   The small is $8 and the large is $11 I think.  Kinda pricey for just lettuce, some cheese and croutons (yes, I know this is what a cesars salad is).  You have to ask for bread and oil/vinegar.   Not cool.  I don't wanna have to remember you have bread.  Just give it to me.  You change like $20 for a pie that costs you like $3 to make.   Give my ass some bread.      I like the atmosphere though.  They have outdoor seating that hits the spot when the weather is good.   Wait staff is usually attentive and friendly.   Don't remember them not being on top of making sure you're experience is going right.   If you don't mind an expensive pizza that's pretty good, like a very good cesars salad, and want a trendy/well decorated place, give Grimaldis' a try."}
{"text":"I ordered a personal pizza today.  When I picked it up and brought it home it was cold.  I am very disappointed.   I eaten at your (Boca Park) several times and always had  hot pizzas.   My complaint is for the Boca Park location not the Eastern  location.  I do not know if their is new management it is not the same."}
{"text":"so delicious! this is close to our house, we eat here often, and the atmosphere is great! i have only tried the pizza and salad. they have nice patio seating too!"}
{"text":"Crust was great but pizza was just a little boring!!!   Place is very clean. Service was not as good as it should be, but he hostess was friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Came here while on vacation in Las Vegas.  Had to wait a little while to be seated however; we were in a decent sized group of 8 people so it was expected that we may have to wait. Once we were seated our waiter came to take our drink orders immediately. Unfortunately I can not remember what his name was however he gave us great service and had an energetic personality (really funny).   We ended up ordering 4 bottles of a Chianti and 6 calzones' and 1 large pizza all with different toppings and or fillings. It was really nice how they have it were you can choose your ingredients off a list and add as much of what ingredient as you want. We are carnivores so we packed ours with meat.  It did take a little while for our order to reach our table, about 25 minutes however; we had multiple bottles of wine... we didn't mind a little wait!   When the food did reach our table it looked and smelled amazing. Upon biting in it tasted even better then it looked. You can tell it was fresh made straight from the oven. the crust had a nice crunch on the outside yet soft more fully inside texture. Overall taste of the food was great.  Are waiter would stop by the table every so often and check in on how the food was and would engage in small talk each time which we enjoyed.  After we were finished eating we still had a lot of late night plans yet were feeling a little sleepy after devouring all the delicious food. Our waiter overheard us talking about it and brought us all free coffee to help keep us up - and it sure did..  Overall we had a great experience here and if we ever find ourselves in Vegas again looking for some pizza we shall return"}
{"text":"Great pizza, poor service........and it wasn't even busy. Disappointed   I keep to the Scottsdale quarter location, service is always better than average."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and got two pizzas.  1 GF white garlic and 1 regular white garlic.  Both were delish!  Definitely not for celiac due to non dedicated oven, but for those that can tolerate a cross contamination risk...so good!  Crispy, buttery and chewy GF crust!"}
{"text":"Wayyyyyyyy over priced. Very very disappointed in everything we ordered. The crust was almost raw and very tough. Topping are expensive and very sparse. Plus I was charged for a large when I received a small. WILL NOT BE RETURNING EVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Prosciutto & Arugala on a white pizza....amazing! If that's all I can say then that says it all. Let me start by saying I am not a pizza person so I was a bit reluctant to try this spot out but without a doubt I was quite pleased.   This pizza was really good. I loved the white pizza! We also got to try the caprese and ceaear salad. The cesear salad has chunks of Parmesan (I believe) sheds on it, yumm! The caprese mozzarella and tomato were very generous sizes. I wish the balsamic was put on it for us but I get that they want to allow patrons to put as much as they would like.   I wanted to try the dessert but I was so full, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I have finally found it.... THE WORST PIZZA I HAVE EVER THROWN AWAY.  Picked up a large pizza and a small salad on a Sunday night.  NO PARKING at Scottsdale Quarter. Had to drive around the block 4 times.  I arrived at the designated time to get this slop, and the pie was in a soggy box...inside a thermo zippered thing...and it appears to have been sitting there for sometime.  I called the order in at 5:00...to get it at 6:00...and they obviously made it right away and set it aside.  The salad was pure oil and not worth eating.  The meal cost $32.60.  I gave the girl at the bar a $100.00 bill and stopped the show.  The bartender had to fish thru his pocket to produce the necessary change.  NO RECEIPT given.  You would be better off to go to the Circle K and get a slice of their pizza....as surely it would be better.  I can honestly say.....in my decades of eating pizza....this was the WORST CRAP I have ever been served.   STAY AWAY.  Expensive....lacking personality...poorly presented...and hard to do business.  Suffice to say...I will NEVER...EVER....go back to a Grimaldi's. LKCOWBOY +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ The only thing a restaurant can do after a customer has a bad experience...is to try to make it right.  30 minutes after posting my scathing review of Grimaldi's Scottsdale Quarter....JOE the Manager called me on the number I left for my disastrous pick-up.  Joe apologized profusely and offered to refund my money...make me another pie....or leave a gift certificate at the front desk. I greatly appreciate his sincerity in wanting to correct a flubbed pick-up. Based on his response...I will give it another chance. Whoever trained JOE as Manager, did a great job...as his attitude more than made up for the pizza. The place was packed...so everyone has NOT had my experience.  \"Thanks Joe....I greatly appreciate your call and interest.\" See you soon. LKcowboy"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!  I came in this past Saturday with a group of friends visiting from California. We went to a spring training game earlier in the day and then decided to continue our fun in Old Town Scottsdale. Once we arrived we immediately needed some good hearty food. We walked along Scottsdale Rd. to find Grimadi's; Italian food was just what we needed.  There was a short wait so we were offered to sit in their seating area. My friend sitting next to me was about to snap a \"selfie\" when an older women offered to take us to our table. She instantly was snotty to my friend because she was in the middle of taking a selfie, which take 2 seconds; not a long time.   We all followed her to our table thinking \"That was just weird, did she just yell at our friend for taking a selfie?\" Once we sat down my friend continued on her phone much like almost everyone does now-a-days and then out of no where the OLD hostess says \"We won't tolerate that, feel free to get up at any time.\" I was dumbfounded! Instantly full of rage and we all stormed out.   This was VERY disappointing especially after now reading about how good their food is. I would have loved to try it but not with the service they give; I'd rather spend my money somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Where are you people eating pizza and claiming this is the best you have tasted? Its bland with a tough crust. The sauce has no resemblance to an italian pizza taste. There wasnt 1 drop of oil anywhere to be found. Rosatis and Casanovas kill this pizza and they are not exceptional. Also, a brick oven can only do so much. A traditional pizza oven is the way to go. In a nutshell, this is over priced crappy pizza!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizzaria is a GEM of a restaurant in a GEM of a shopping mall directly across the street from a GEM of a hotel. LOVE this place!  Adriana and I were staying at the Wynn to celebrate our anniversary, and we opted for Grimaldi's on our first night there, just because we had such a good experience when we were in town last year, and we were exhausted from the 45 minute flight from Burbank.   A Lego Store just opened next door, so K'ayum was already in heaven. We scored the last outside table. (OK, not outside, 'cause you're in a mall, but outside the restaurant. Got it?)  Perfect for people-watching.  I ordered a carafe of chianti, and the friendly waitress even scared up an ice bucket to chill it a bit. We started with a small spinach salad  (I, Christopher C., ALWAYS start with a salad) and it was excellent and enough for the three of us to share.   For a pizza, we opted for pepperoni, spicy chicken sausage, onions, and peppers. The pizza was incredible -  the sausage was nice and spicy and the crust was perfect. It was a great meal, and my son scored a great Lego set! (Note to self: go to Lego store BEFORE consuming a carafe of wine...)   I hear there's a location in Southern California - I'm going to have to look that up! But then again, Grimaldi's is a PERFECT excuse for a Vegas road trip..."}
{"text":"I don't review often, but I am still sitting at my table here at Grimaldis and I had to write this review. The pizza i just attempted to chew here at Grimaldis at Park West was less than average. The crust was supposed to be the best part and it was not at all. It was so chewy that me and my partner could barely chew it. The toppings were sparingly and they charge for every topping ($2).  I Have eaten at Grimaldis in Scottsdale and it was much better. I would much rather have had pizza hut than this. I love pizzeria bianco and rays of ny. I hope mgr here sees this and figures it out soon."}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is the best!! Great vibe...awesome food, the pizza was thin crust, but it was not paper thin....the staff and service were top notch, there is not a bad thing that I could say...loved it, would definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is an awesome pizza establishment. They have a coal fired oven which gives a distinctive flavor that is truly enjoyable. The decor inside is complete with pictures of New York City and celebrities to commemorate that the original Grimaldi's is located in Brooklyn. The service was great and attentive and was knowledgeable about the menu. If your looking for an authentic New York pizza experience but you happen to be in Scottsdale...look no further."}
{"text":"Went in here cause I drive by it everyday and always try and remind myself to try the place out.  So I finally decided to try it and it was definitely worth it!  I was not really sure what to expect from Grimaldi's since the sit down pizza places I am used to are either the buffet kind (like CiCi's) or the mom and pop places (like Rocco's NY Pizzeria).  Walking in I was definitely surprised.  The lighting in the restaurant is all done by cutting the bottoms off of wine bottles and using them as the light fixtures to which the bulbs are attached like chandeliers.  Very cool look and goes well with the rest of restaurant.  Somewhat dark, but not in the overly romantic sort of way.  Food wise, I ordered a calzone which was fantastic.  I had never had a calzone the way that they served it, without sauce inside it, which at first was a bit odd, but it was great!  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly.  The owner even came over and said hello and was very engaging and polite.  A great date place or somewhere to go hang out, have a drink with a friend or two and have some great pizza."}
{"text":"Food is great. The service is consistently slow on the weekends... Plan an hour to get your pizza if it's Friday or Saturday evening."}
{"text":"I like this location better than the one in Old Town, which is the only other location I've been to. It's a pretty small restaurant, but they also have a small private room in the back for gatherings.   The ingredients all taste fresh and if you sit at a high top in the bar area you can watch them make the pizza. I love watching the prep! We  actually forgot our leftovers after our last visit and one of the waiters came out to give them to us. So nice!  If you're lucky you may find parallel parking spot right out front, but there's also more parking in a big lot just to the west of the restaurant. And the best part is you can walk off your meal by strolling around the shops."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, authentic ambiance and our server, Jamie, was great!  Prices are decent/reasonable and probably my only reason for not giving a 5 star review."}
{"text":"This place is DA BOMB DOT COM.  Amazing food, fresh ingredients, very professional and courteous staff, excellent prices.  Perfect ambience.  Easy parking.  Going back for sure.  Shout out - GREAT JOB!"}
{"text":"Went to have a glass of wine before the movies. This is a cute restaurant that offers phenomenal pizza! The bartenders were very attentive and personable. We chatted about the upcoming movie that we were about to see. The bartenders are both warm and friendly which made our visit better. The restaurant was quite crowded, even late into the evening but the staff was on point, always smiling at the customers. Pizza was delish! Yummy authentic pizza! I've been there before and I will go there again!"}
{"text":"Love Grimaldi pizza and salads! I think the crust and just the whole thin crust style  NY style pizza. Devine! The pizza sauce is on point so much depth too it then just tomatoes taste the hints of herbs and lot of flavor. The mozzarella believe buffalo combine with toppings brings it full circle. I prefer only put two topping or less because since then crust pizza last thing want weight it down with toppings. The topping from the pepperoni (like not the then slice circle ones see at mass market pizza joints) nice big ones, sausage nice thin sliced pieces, and toppings all fresh nothing see in mass market aka pizza huts of the world. My favorite is pepperoni and sausage on my pie. The salads are really good! I had both the caesar and mediterranean salad. Mediterranean salad is Winner! It nice fresh full salad with cucumbers, greek blacks olives, red onions, tomatoes, and feta cheese. They offer you fresh cracked black pepper when salad arrives not always automatic in many restaurants. I never have room for desserts time finish meal.  What II really enjoy about the menu is its simplicity. It straight forward about the pie, salad, and desserts. This day and age seems more and more restaurants have huge menus. So too get that true sense of a new york family ma and pa pizza joint adds too the dining experience. The atmosphere not have more of brooklyn feeling too it with all the new york city pics and checker board red and white table linen. The lights are pretty cool concept with the empty wine bottles.  I am big fan of Grimaldi! It only pizza eat now if need too get my pie fix in!!"}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's pizza! It still amazes too think it all started with the one location all the way in Henderson (for me opposite side of town) and now they have multiple locations all over the Valley. So whenever have my itch for think crust pizza always Grimaldi close by! It was my first time at this particular location. The food it was par with all the other Grimaldi's the perfect think crust, love the sauce, and love the toppings am two topping type of pizza lover. Only because feel with this style of pizza ONLY way too go because love the crust less is better. The fresh buffalo mozzarella not but loving there. Pizza awesome like always!  The service our server was very friendly, never had empty glass, and management was very much present checking up on us. It smaller location compare too two other locations been too. I always fan of the decor with the brick style walls, the red and white checkerboard table cloth, the simplicity of the menu, and the empty win bottle for lights. The old rat pack style of music playing in the restaurant or specifically Frankie Sinatra.   It nice that now there so many options in Fashion Show Mall not just food court!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's, you really showed me. How I used to scoff at you every time I drove by!  \"New York-style?! BLERGH! Folding pizza in half while the oil drips on the plate? Nooooo thanks!\" And then I'd cackle unattractively and come home to junk flyers on my doorsteps from three other pizzerias within a half mile, each of which had disappointed me at some point. (Ending with turning out to be litterbug spammers.) Would I have to leave Las Vegas to get some good pizza?!  (I do enjoy the end pieces at Northside Nathan's, but pizza is my lazy food, and Flamingo is north of my \"lazy zone.\")  Then one day I decided to live up to my \"Let's notch it!\" motto. Also, I was dying for some pizza. And, as noted, I'm lazy. \"Mike! Let's go to Grimaldi's!\"  \"Ugh. Isn't that famously New York-style?\"  \"Yeah, but I reeeeeaaaalllly want pizza. And if we don't like it, we can savage it on Yelp.\"  (Talk about your 21st-century pep talks. But, I think it was the timeless appeal of having someone else cook that won him over.)  I can't remember now if we went back twice that week or only once. I only know that I walked into Grimaldi's as a skeptic and within the hour was a bubbling fan.  We've never eaten in the restaurant proper, but it has a casual, accessible elegance with congenial staff from the door to the bar. The outside patio dining looks pleasant enough (for those three or four weeks out of the year when it's not a misery to be outside), with one side of the bar serving those inside and the other serving those out. To-go pizza orders are placed on the inside-side of the bar.  As is my usual, I got a regular pizza with mushrooms. Skeptical Mike grabbed something from a nearby fast food place instead because we'd already figured out through a number of bad experiences that we both disliked New York-style pizza, and he wasn't going to go through the sad journey again, especially not to a box that boasted that this was the pizza that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous.  But as we drove away, we both couldn't help but notice how good the box smelled. (And my nose has been undependable since I had pneumonia last winter.)  By the time we were home, the pizza still unseen, Mike was questioning whether he'd made the right choice.  Well, this pizza was beautiful. Thin crust, absolutely, but not the kind where you pick up the slice and it points at your lap. The crust had flavour; it wasn't just a sauce-n-toppings vehicle. The sauce wasn't too sweet; I'm not a fan of a sweet sauce, but nor was it bland or just \"tomato-y.\" I can't elevate it to \"spicy\" (my preference), but there's a full, pleasant taste.   Mozzarella fans would be proud of how the cheese melted just enough while staying a little solid, reminiscent of fresh mozzarella slices. The mushrooms tastes of the market, not the can, and they were evenly distributed across the pizza.  And with every bite, that waft of YUM.  The next night, Mike wanted Grimaldi's. He'd been envious for the past 24 hours. (But was thwarted by the evil mushrooms.) I'm not sure how many times we've been since. We've had a few \"off\" encounters: they forgot my mushrooms once, the crusts were a bit burnt another time, and of course sometimes you order pizza then, two bites later, realize you want a break from it.   Overall, though, so far Grimaldi's has been a reliable place for a tasty pizza. Sure, I wish they made the thick crust-style I prefer, but what they do, they do so well. As I see them listed as one of the top pizza places in the country on list after list, I realize that maybe those New Yorkers aren't so crazy when it comes to pizza after all. Someday I'll have to try other items on Grimaldi's menu, which includes pesto and white pizzas as well as calzones, but it's hard to mess with what has finally proven to be a very sure thing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a late snack after a show.  We had sausage pizza.  It was very good, sauce was delicious.  Impressed coming from New York where we have pizzerias on nearly every corner.  Service good.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! Thin crust, cheese Is amazing! Service was so great! My mouth is watering just talking about it. Good  for kids too. Hubby loved the devils paddle ale beer. They only have pizza and calzones but pizza alone is worth it!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's - Not For Everyone  I almost gave Grimaldi's 3 stars, because it seemed to be fairly popular and busy, but when I mentally compared their pizza - which I thought was good - to the many other pizza restaurant options, it didn't hold up well, so I knocked them down to 2 stars. I've ordered pizza at dozens of restaurants, including most of the major chains, over the years, and I've also made hundreds of pizza at home from scratch.  To me, only a few factors determine the quality of a pizza. For the most part, onions are onions, peppers are peppers, olives are olives, mushrooms are mushrooms - most toppings are pretty much going to taste the same wherever you get your pizza.   What sets pizza apart for me are: crust, sauce, pepperoni and sausage. Grimaldi's crust was descent. On the plus side, it was only burnt a tiny bit near the edges, but it was mushy and gooey at the center. Many brick oven pizzerias are cavalier about burning their crusts, ignorant to the fact that a burnt crust ruins the taste. I always send a burnt pizza back for one that is cooked properly.  As I watched the pizzas being made, they seemed to put very little sauce on their pies, but it seems to spread out as the pizza cooks. Still, my pizza seemed dry, in need of more sauce, at the edges, and the sauce itself lacked any zesty flavor - it was fairly bland. Grimaldi's has options other than the tomato sauce that I ordered, but I can't comment on those  Grimaldi's pepperoni was good, not great. On a positive note, they don't slice it paper thin like virtually every other pizzeria in town, it was a nice, thick slice, like pepperoni should be. I'm reminded of a pizzeria I went to once in Philly - their pepperoni was so delicious, I asked what type it was and where they got it. They ended up selling me 1 one pound stick which I brought back to Phoenix. I was better than any pepperoni that I've sourced locally. Grimaldi's sausage was also just okay, my main complaint is that they - like most pizzerias - don't offer a hot sausage option. I want sausage to be more than just another topping - I want to taste it.   At one time, I thought Streets of New York made was best pizza restaurant in town, but that was nearly 30 years ago and in my opinion their quality has come down significantly over the years. My current favorite - though not strictly a pizzeria - is Red, White & Brew. Though I never order pizza when I dine in, I order their pizza often as take out. Grimaldi's popularity puzzles me."}
{"text":"Great pizza service was top of the line. We had the house recommended pizza that included sausage and meatballs, it was some of the best pizza I have had. Mozzarella cheese really added to the pizza. Only downside was the salad, it was average although I could've asked for more cheese."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is very generous with their birthday gift if you are in their email club; they give you a large one topping pizza for free! No other purchase necessary! They allow to you add toppings on it for additional cost of $2-4 depending on the topping. We got sausage, mushroom, and black olive. They also have kalamata olive. I would have preferred the kalamata bc the sausage wasn't overly salty like a lot of places, so the black olive actually wasn't salty enough.   Still overall a very tasty pizza. Very thin and crisp crust, generous with the toppings, and the sauce while thin was very flavorful and a little sweet.  Even though the large is a thin crust, we still had two pieces leftover to take home. It also reheats really well.  The only minus is it seems there is only one guy that makes the pizzas. It was not a busy time while we were there, and it still took 25 mins for us to get our order."}
{"text":"Service no different than in Brooklyn. Slow and stuffy wait staff. Food not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nice pizza great crust but a little stingy on the toppings"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas, friendly staff, and a great location. We make this place a regular stop a couple times a month."}
{"text":"I guess this location in the Fashion Show mall is new, but still, 2 reviews??  Chalk up another 5 star.  Hands down, my choice for best NY pizza anywhere.  I've eaten at their original shop in brooklyn and this location does the Grimaldi's name justice.  Keep it simple and you'll be rewarded with an awesome pizza here.  And their mozzarella...damn..."}
{"text":"I love grimaldis pizza and love the casa Paloma environment, around cooler weather and the holidays it's so fun to shop the plaza and stop by for lunch! There is something with the dough and just toppings in general that even though the pizza is quite expensive, it's worth it! We always get the pepperoni with ricotta. We have had the salad and antipasta appetizer as we'll and both equally good and fresh! A tip for people who don't want to spend to much for pizza go for lunch, they have great lunch deals with a small individual size pizza for you to try"}
{"text":"It is a pleasant surprise to find a Grimaldi Pizzeria at the Palazzo, right next to the Venetian.   We ordered a caprese, a pizza, a calzone, and some drinks. The caprese was good, I've had better. The pizza was also good, it could have used more cheese. The calzone was great, I picked kalamata olives and mushrooms, and those ingredients delivered an amazing calzone. Very good calzone, no doubt about that. The space is very NY like, very cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza o have ever had. The pesto sauce is amazing. Such a great amosphere and I love the fact yoy can drink wine will eating amazing pizza!! Awsome place!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for a good slice of pizza. i love the service here def. one of my new favorite spots to get pizza their cheese is amazing"}
{"text":"Went to Otto near the gondolas and then later here. Both places we ordered the exact same pizza, margarita with extra basil. The pizza at Otto was much much better.   Grimalidi is a decent pie but just doesn't have the authentic Italian magic which Otto has. The crust was doughy and dry, the cheese tasteless and clumpy, the sauce was fine. Lastly, the ambiance at Otto is much better than Grimaldi.  Prices are the same at both places, so no reason not to check out Otto"}
{"text":"On \"Black Friday\" November 27, 2015 we decided to have a late lunch at  Grimaldi's Pizzeria on Ray Road. Since we have dined here many times, we expected a great meal without issues. We arrived around 1:30PM and seated right away. This was after the normal lunch hour, so the restaurant was not crowded--but did became crowded latter. A spinach salad was ordered along with a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni and basil. The salad arrived with no issues. We then ordered a second large pizza with basil added after the first pizza was baking. We do not like all hot items served at once as the pizza will cool off. Therefore we order the pies staggered. The first pizza arrived shortly after the salad. Have you ever wondered why a restaurant would serve an over cooked pizza with BLACK BURNT CRUST? I told the server that this $24 pizza was not acceptable. This was not the first time that an unacceptable burnt pizza was served. It was taken away, but still it should NOT have been served UNLESS they decided F it, serve it and see what happens. Of course we understand that the pizza at Grimaldi's is thin crust baked in a very hot oven but over baking is simply not acceptable. The crust was BLACK/BURNT 360 degrees around this pizza. Of course they said they were sorry but \"come on\"! The replacement pizza arrived without issues as did the second pizza. Our total bill was $70.26 including 3 soft drinks and one beer. Due to this experience, I had to reduce the rating since a BURNT pizza was served."}
{"text":"Good thin crust pizza and nice beer selection! I normally don't like thin crusts because it reminds me of eating crackers but the crust at Grimaldi's is crunchy and chewy. Ahhhhhh    I had a good time here -- the people were funny and it wasn't crowded compared to the other restaurants around the area.  I don't know what else to say about this place - just like all the other restaurants in San Tan the place is nice and the food is good. A difference I did notice though, was that their menu was simple, which I liked a lot because it shows confidence in their food. Plus! I hate getting menus that resemble a mini dictionary :/ So yay Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"I'm not much of a pizza connoisseur, and in my book the pizza spectrum is a fairly narrow range of \"good\" to \"very good.\"  Enter Grimaldi's.    There are no witty hipster names or fancy concoctions here.  In fact, I was surprised to find that the menu didn't even provide any suggestions for topping combinations.  Just a choice of regular, white, or pesto base, and a list of run-of-the-mill ingredients such as pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, etc.  But don't let the simplicity of the menu fool you.  The crust was thin and impossibly crispy, with no hint of getting limp as we bore through the 12\" pizza.  The sauce packed a pleasant tangy punch.  The pepperoni was thick, chock full of flavor, all around excellent.  The italian sausage was pleasant, and our mushrooms remained fat and tender despite the coal oven.   Grimaldi's wins you over with fresh, high quality ingredients - no frills or fluff.  It has definitely upped my pizza game, and I can only hope Grimaldi's finds its way to the Washington DC area!"}
{"text":"I don't know why we try after so many burnt pizzas and bad service I should just give up but keep trying for some reason I guess because when it's good it's very good?  Sadly the se ice bug killed us again today running around and decided a early dinner was in order since we missed lunch.  They say there sticking the Restaurant?   It 4 pm and there sticking the Restaurant  why not before you open at 10 am or maybe after you close but nope stocking at 4pm so we can get pizza at 5:30pm hey why not will just watch the staff work for 90 minutes after all no one else sells pizza right.   Sadly after about strike 10 it's not worth it even fir the free pizza they owe me for the last one they forgot to make twice!    Great pizza terrible staff.  The pizza is good no doubt about it it's my favorite pizza but the san tan store has a lousy staff we don't eat there anymore in person because they ignore you and it's almost impossible to get service while they all stand at the center counter in plain view laughing and talking while it takes you a hour to get a drink.  So ok we changed to takeout and the pizza is still great most of the time.  On three occasions our pizza and/or Calzones have been so burned you couldn't eat them if you tried. And I'm not talking about the blackening and crispness from the coal oven nope i'm talking burned black and reeakng of burnt crust and topping,  It happened again last night on Halloween.  We ordered two pizzato go we asked to see them (we have learned the hard way to look before we leave)  one was perfect crisp crust a few black spots perfect cheese great the other was a burnt mess.  It smelled horrible was hard and crispy and the cheese on top was even burnt.  The girl knew it was destroyed and said she could get another one made if we wanted to wait 30 minutes.  We said no then the good one would be bad she agreed and gave us a refund and promised the next one was free as always.  It the manager and staff was better this would be a great place as is in undependable and hit and miss and trust me whoever made this cremated mess knew it was garbage and didn't care."}
{"text":"Great pizza and fresh delicious salad.  Seline gave us great service. What more could you ask for?  Our first meal in Vegas -glad we came across it in the Venetian."}
{"text":"Liked the pizza.  Although this is a pricey pizza if you add any toppings which vary in price from $1 to 2 topping   The cost of a pizza adds up really quickly.  I thought the tomato pizza was a little soggy. I had had this pizza the previous week at the Scottsdale Quarter location. Here the pizza was crisper.  Would go again , but cautious of how many toppings i adorned my pizza with"}
{"text":"Went Saturday night loved the crisp thin pizza crust of the three pizzas that our group ate. The only downside of the pizza was the sparseness of the toppings. The pizzas are large and one slice is very generous. There were only 3 1/2 quarter size slices of pepperoni on my slice   On the mushroom and green pepper pizza I had no mushroom on my slice and a few diced  pieces of green pepper .  I would would go back as the crispness of the crust was really good and ask for a more generous portion of the toppings   The noise level was rather high the servers were very friendly"}
{"text":"Great pizza and salads!! Love \"the don\" pizza with meatballs, pepperoni, and bacon how can you go wrong. Thin crust pizzza, great service always. Small close seating area is the only negative."}
{"text":"Grimalidi's in the Scottsdale Quarter came highly recommended and our family had high expectations for our meal.  The crust was burnt and the the pizza not very flavor full.  The noise level was high which contributed to the 1 out of 5 star rating.  Our family will not be making a return trip."}
{"text":"The pizza has a cheese on it that you won't find at a Pizza Hut. This is for sure a great family place to eat. Our kids loved it."}
{"text":"Honestly surprised by this place and the pizza. I come from an Italian family and a father who is very hard to please with Italian cuisine especially pizza. He said \"might have been the best pizza I've ever had!\" Enough said. Price is surprisingly low for being on the strip and at the palazzo."}
{"text":"On a hunch from a friend we were told to give Grimaldi's a try while raving about Settebello's!!  Me being me, i was scared to vier away and try something new and give up what is always sure to be a wonderful pizza experience!   So how did i try Grimaldi's?? Well, i was in a wedding on Friday and was busy all day from 9am-till after the reception ending at about 11:00pm, leaving the husband to fend for himself for the day!  I get a call about 4:00pm, \"honey, I have a surprise for you! Can i tell you what it is? Can i please???\" My reply \"No love, that would make it not be a surprise anymore, now i have something to look forward to...  I will get it when i see you!\" and due to the fact that i at this point have large hair, too much make-up on and am in a freezing cold reception room trying to get all the name cards placed on the tables and get the bride ready and keep her happy, while keeping the kids outta the way and clean in their flower girl dresses i am excited to have a surprise waiting for me when all is said and done!!!  Driving home after a beautiful wedding, the husband says... \"are you excited for your surprise? Can i give you a hint??\"  \"Yes dear, i am VERY excited for my surprise, lay it on me!\"   \"Remember what we wanted to try, but didnt want to give something else up for?\"  I came home to half a pizza from Grimaldi's!!!!!!! :)  AAAaaahhhh, how cute!!  Ok, back to the review.. while it was cold and not pipping hot and fresh i few minutes of heating up, it was wonderful!!! Now, I cant wait to go get one and try it fresh, its WAY closer to the house than Settebello's is and now I am willing to give it a try and vier away at least once!  So for now 4 stars, and if this location is closer or better for you than Settebello's is (at least for now till they move next to Whole Food's in The District) it is a fair trade off, or even if you want to go crazy and mix it up a bit!!!  Now can i get a.... WWHHOOOAAAA PIZZA!!!!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Deep dish rules all.  I'll remove them from the equation for this review.  So I've had NY pizza before...huge honking slices where folding is not just what the cool kids do, it's necessary to not give yourself a Chelsea grin while eating.  These slices are a bit more manageable in size...and much better tasting, in my opinion.  I looked forward to the white pizza we got, but I discovered they really load the ricotta on if that's what you order...and too much ricotta just doesn't sit well with me.  It tasted good, but it felt like my mouth was being stuffed with foam.  The mushroom, pepperoni, and sun-dried tomato pizza...now this was par excellence.  Even ignoring that sun-dried tomatoes may be my #1 condiment of all time (even beating out giardiniera), the crust was good, and the light sauce let the toppings shine.  Besides the food, we barely waited despite having a big party, and the service was good enough.  Definitely a fun place to go with a large group."}
{"text":"Came to Grimaldi's because they send an email for a free pizza if you are signed up for their birthday club.  That is a fantastic deal because it comes out to around a $20 value.  The pizza is delicious and the service is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Decent pizza conveniently located in the Palazzo.  Salads are on the smaller side (even for the large).  Not a very good value but enjoyable dining experience"}
{"text":"Thought it was delicious but still love the pizza from the Grimaldis in new york better. i think the way they are selling it in las vegas is that it is a high end pizza, at least that is what our waitress said who has not been to the one in new york. My friends said that this was the best pizza they have ever had. We ordered a pizza with meatballs, pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms (delicious) and a pizza with basil, mozzarella and tomatoes which was also delicious."}
{"text":"Always solid NY style pizza from a Wood Baked Oven.  Actually tastes better slightly cooled than hot out of the oven.  Good portion side salad with maybe a little too much Cesar dressing.  Not Lou Malnatti's but for it's style and quality first rate."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite small chain pizza place. I visit these pizzerias all over the country. The cheese, meats and sauces are all made in house and the pizzas are coal fired. The food is always super fresh and delicious. I tried their green apple mimosa for the first time tonight. I'll definitely have to have one of these now with each visit! So good"}
{"text":"I first tried Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.  The Brooklyn location was pretty crowded.  We waited in line for a while to enjoy communal seating and grumpy Eastern European servers.  The pizza was good, but exhausting to get to. The local Grimaldi's has the great food with none of annoyances.  If you insist on thick crust/Chicago style pizza or don't really care what people throw on your pizza then, seriously, what are you doing?  Do some frickin research.  But if you like thin crust pizza, with high quality ingredients, this is the place for you.    I suggest asking for extra cheese.  The mozzarella has always been the bomb and worth every penny.  All the ingredients are high quality and you will end up paying more for your pizza, but, imho, it is worth it."}
{"text":"i liked the pizza but the service could be better the staff seemed not interested in serving me pizza .  may go back but not sure at this point."}
{"text":"Love love Grimaldi's.  I'm from Chicago we have some great pizza so for me to give 5 stars is a big deal.  When ever I am in Phoenix it's a must go normally twice if I'm there for a week.  I love the charcoal flavor that the crust takes on...for something different try the white pizza....I was skeptical but I love it.  If you live in Phoenix or just visiting find a Grimaldi's and have pizza night."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends, wait staff was really friendly, food came out pretty fast. Ordered 4 small pizzas, more than enough for 6 people. Taste wise it's above average but nothing spectacular. Priced decently for food on the strip. Random note, they had some odd bright LED lights facing our table so it's always nice to get blinded while eating."}
{"text":"It is Grimaldis. You can never go wrong with this Pizz place. Create your own brick fired pizza, munch on an antipasto spread or just get the standard pepperoni. Nothing else like it on the planet.  Service is always quick. And the quality is always tops.  Always remember to tip your server ;-)"}
{"text":"Just love the food here!  I am so happy to visit Flagstaff and eat here.  My favorite spot since I moved to Sedona...wish we had one here."}
{"text":"My favorite pizzeria in town!  They use the freshest ingredients to create the pizza of your tastebuds dreams...  I love the Greek salad to start and the Tiramisu to end, they have the best Tiramisu that I've ever tasted, it melts in my mouth.  The service and atmosphere of this location is awesome!  There is a full bar along with a wide variety of wines and patio seating.  They also have a closed off party room in the back that can be reserved for private parties."}
{"text":"Great, great place. Fun setting, great music and amazing pizza. I think it's good for all ages, too. Seems very authentic-and who doesn't love eating pizza and listening to Frank, Sammy and Dean."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this pizza chain. I love how you can customize your own pizza exactly how you want it and the ingredients are always high quality. My personal favorite meat is the spicy chicken sausage and getting the fresh basil thrown on at the end after everything is cooked is out of this world! The salads are huge, and fresh so keep that in mind when ordering, as the small house salad can easy feed two. I am usually not a huge dessert person, but I can never resist ordering the Oreo cheese cake at the end. It's the best way to top off a great dinner, and I do not believe I could ever get tired of eating here!"}
{"text":"When we arrived, the restaurant was more than half empty. The front desk clerk said that there was a 40 minute wait. When I asked why, the young person said that they had reservations for all the tables that were empty. We sat in the bar and the food was very good and the server was excellent. During the entire hour that we were there, the empty tables stood empty in the dining room. The restaurant is run by extremely young people who have no idea what they are doing. They took reservations and no one showed but they kept the tables open for nonexistent reservations while people were waiting to be served and spend money. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat pizza! The rest of their menu is really good also. I love starting off with their Ceasar salad and I usually wash it all down with their Peroni on tap."}
{"text":"You just never know about pizza, but this place is awesome!  Thin crust with any toppings you want! Menu is a la carte so it's not cheap, but you do get what you pay for!  Friendly service too.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with David as our bartender..Great guy. Pizza was terrific as well, but Dave is a hoot! Very attentive."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is definitely a solid option for pizza in the valley.  Being from the east coast, it's hard to find authentic mom & pop shop pizza places out here.  If you now what I mean, you know exactly what I mean.  Grimaldi's never disappoints, but is a tad pricey.  If you add some toppings, you can easily have a $35 pizza on your hands without blinking an eye.  Pricing aside, you can't go wrong for quality pizza.  I also recommend eating in.  I don't find this pizza is as good if you order take-out."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but not my favorite. In fairness I have already been spoiled by another pizza place in the valley. The staff was super friendly and the environment was very enjoyable! Service was great !!!"}
{"text":"The only time I felt like a winner in Vegas was at Grimaldi's.  We ordered a personal pizza and a personal calzone so we could try them both.  I'll put it  as simple as I can...if I could open a franchise in my basement I would.  The pizza was fantastic and the calzone was better."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever.  Great taste.   Wife loves the tomato sauce.  She could drink it straight from the little gravy bowl.  Tried the pizza and the calzone.  Both were safe for her to eat with her peanut and tree nut allergy.  Love it all."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Having eaten at the Brooklyn location, I had huge expectations, but they fell short.   Don't get me wrong, the pizza wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was just OK. The crust was thin and crispy, just how I like it, and my plate wasn't covered in orange grease when I was done., which is another positive.   But the pizza, which started out as great, became increasingly boring piece after piece. I don't know how this is possible, but both the sauce and the crust lost some, or rather most of their punch after it cooled down a bit.   We ordered a  1/2 carafe of their house red and it was lovely, and the service we experienced was exceptional. No complaints there.   When shopping in Boca Park, it would be a great stop for lunch, and hubby and I agreed we'd return to Grimaldi's rather than go to our usual lunch spot, Cheesecake Factory, but we probably won't be planning any dinners here again.   Oh and the outside dining is fabulous! Very nice little area with great people watching. So since Vegas has such a small window of 75 degree weather, you gotta jump on it and find a place with a decent patio."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner, and loved our meal and the experience.  The pizza is excellent, and the atmosphere reminds me of NY.  We also had a calzone, which was good, but not as good as the pizza.  Service was friendly and quick.  The appetizer of bruschetta was good, also."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and I keep forgetting to leave a review. The pizza is so yummy. We've also had a few of the salads and some of the desserts too. The prices are reasonable and the service is great too. On our most recent visit we were served by Dayna and another young lady who was trainging (I don't recall her name). Both were excellent."}
{"text":"I've had Grimaldi's in the past.  Today, just did't hit the mark.  White pizza was EXTRA crispy.  If I wasn't hungry and in a hurry as always, I would have gone back (I work nearby so its easy to go pick up) and asked for a new pie.  Bummer too... cause usually they are really awesome."}
{"text":"Oh Grimaldis, where do I start?!? The pizza is amazing (pepperoni and jalapeño being our family favorite) and its always made perfectly with the right amount of toppings but the reason I can't give 5 stars is because I can't understand why the bathrooms are so small!!! Three people can not even fit in their comfortably, I like to wash my hands without reaching over people so that's why I have to give 4 stars. If the bathroom was spacious it would definitely be 5 stars!!! But service and pizza are amazing!"}
{"text":"Pizza is AMAZING! I'm not even sure where to begin - fresh ingredients (you can taste the freshness), thin but filling crust, and served right out of the oven to the table. Nothing tops this.  But it's not just pizza, their appetizers are equally amazing and delicious. I have yet to try their other entrees, but judging from looks and smell, A++.  In addition, customer service is great - enthusiastic, professional, and top notch staff. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This location was far better than the one in Kierland area. The server took great care of us. The food cake out quick and the pizza was delicious and light."}
{"text":"Good pizza, could have used more garlic and the bottom was not crispy, kinda soggy.  I've eaten at the Grimaidi's in New York, that was fantastic."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero star, I would. This was the one bad blimp on a great trip to Vegas. We ordered 1 calzone and a beer. 20 minutes later, we had to ask for the beer again and finally got it. 50-60 minutes later we finally asked for our check after not getting any food. They tried to charge us for food we didn't get, and after asking to pay for just the drink we did get, when the check was dropped off, we were immediately asked to pay with cash or check when the check was dropped off. Mistakes happen in restaurants, but when it's your mistake, I expect not to be treated like someone who might dine and dash. Especially after almost an hour of being ignored, and then finally asking for a check due to an abundance of honesty. This place SUCKS. Never going back. If you want a good experience, go to Secret Pizza."}
{"text":"I was really hesitate about this pizza place only because they specialize in thin crust. We didn't get to go inside but we picked up on curb side which was really convenient.   We order a large half sausage and half pepperoni. The pizza was so light I was afraid that we didn't order enough for 3.    Glad to report that the pizza was so yummy and it wasn't even greasy! More than enough with left overs I give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but not great. Ordered 3 large combo type and it was 105.00$ !!!!! FOR PIZZA. Whatever. Won't get my money again."}
{"text":"Found them on 10 best cheap eats Vegas... It had great reviews by my fellow yelpers!  Yelpers great job reviewing this pizzeria!!!  I have to say, the pizza was excellent!    We shared a Ceaser salad, yummy.  Just like the way I like it crisp lettuce, cold out of the fridge, baked croutons with fresh shaved Parmesan cheese.  We just wanted to get a small bite, got the small (their version of medium) traditional pizza.  The sauce and cheese were good, but it's the thin crust dough that's sooooo good!  Suggestion;  Don't use the Parmesan cheese that's on the table but ask for the fresh shaved Parmesan.  The place is nicely decorated and has a cool vibe.  The reason I gave it 4 stars; our waitress forgot our waters, forgot to bring croutons that we asked on the side, and we had to ask twice for our check.   C'mon it's a service job if you can't get the order right at least bring the check on time...  Just keepin' it real The Real Foodie"}
{"text":"My only complaint about this place is that it took our pizza a long time to come out especially for 2:30 on Sunday afternoon. Once it got out to us it was GREAT! We had the Don and I'm craving it a day after. We also had small Mediterranean salad that was really good. It had a light oil and vinegar type dressing but was light and didn't make the salad soggy. It was big enough for two people to share. Afterwards we couldn't resist the dessert menu. We got the trio of chocolate cheesecake, caramel apple cheesecake, and the cannoli. They were all amazing, but the caramel apple cheesecake was my favorite. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for wet, bubbly, cardboard, with unseasoned sauce, then this is the place for you! My friend and I ordered an 18' pizza (half and half) and they were BOTH disgusting."}
{"text":"The cheese calzone with marinara sauce was very cheesy and good.  We also got a white pizza with mushroom and sausage on it, and the pizza was a big hit. We ordered our food to go and enjoyed it in our hotel room.   We waited in the bar area for about 25-30 minutes while our order was made.  The bartender was consistently checking in on us even though we only ordered one beer while waiting.  Nice little place in the mall to eat with the family."}
{"text":"For my hubby and I on a Saturday night Grimaldi's turned out to be pretty lame. The restaurant is decorated well and the hostess was friendly enough but the actual pizza was SOOOOO BORING. I seriously took a bite and wondered if I had missed the slice altogether. I will say I tasted a lot of garlic but that doesn't count for much when the pepporoni is bland and the sauce is useless. Now I'm a deep-dish girl at heart but I've had AMAZING thin slice at Classic Italian Pizza in Tempe. This place made me feel like I wasted my money and I woudn't ever want to bring anyone here including myself again!"}
{"text":"Perfect for after work food and beer! The bartender Anthony and the Manager Cody were awesome!"}
{"text":"The thing about high expectations is that they're often difficult-if not impossible-to meet.  I enjoyed the sun dried tomato pizza and the bartender was very friendly and helpful, but somehow I left unfulfilled...I'd probably spent just one day too many in Vegas!  I will definitely return with more grounded expectations and, if you're looking for a good, thin crust pizza on the Strip that's somewhat reasonably priced, you won't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the pizza here! Im from Chicago so its hard to find good pizza but Grimaldis nailed it! The staff was very friendly and attentive. I would recommend their pizza to everyone, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at this place. Nestled in the Venetian, it was pretty dead in the middle of the afternoon. They deliver solid NY style pizza at a decent price. The have an array of sizes and a pretty varied menu. Caesar salad was a step above most- great dressing and big croutons and sliced parmesan. Just what these ladies needed to sop up the alcohol from the night before. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza I've ever had. Service was great & our server was very sweet & patient while I took awhile to make my final decision."}
{"text":"Seriously awesome pizza ... Great atmosphere and great service too!  Salad was heavy on the dressing so probably wouldn't do again next time but hey try this pizza!!"}
{"text":"This was my husband & my first visit. We decided to take advantage of the free Birthday pizza offer for signing up for their emails. And we were NOT disappointed. Some of the best pizza I have had in Vegas! Fresh ingredients & fired to perfection. Service is outstanding. Our server Kristyn was friendly, attentive & suggested a wonderful wine (& reminded us it was half-price Tues..BIG KUDOS!!). Environment is decorated beautifully, comfortable and casual. I believe this is going to become one of our fav spots."}
{"text":"Excellent salads, better than excellent pizza, good beer and wine selection and terrific service.  We love this place, it is our go to pizza place whenever we visit the area.  When we move there this next spring, we're likely there at least a few times per month.  Highly recommended, but be aware of their \"Stoking Hour\" between 4pm and 5pm daily...they aren't cooking pizza during that time."}
{"text":"I've been going to Grimaldi's for years now.  They've got a great pizza.  Super thin and crisp crust.  Fresh mozzarella and quality toppings!"}
{"text":"Great Great Pizza!!!!  The reason I gave it three stars is because the service. My friend and I walked in and was told give me a minute by the host. The host was busy with a to go order. Three servers came to the front and never greeted or acknowledged my friend and I. The manager was standing over by the pizza stove and watched us. Asked two others if we have been helped but never came over to see for herself. A male server finally came up to us but by that time the host was available for us. We were sat. Again not paid attention to for about 5 mins before I stopped a server and ask \"is there someone who can help us?\"   she said she would get us started. She ended up being our server. Not once did the manager visit our table.   will visit again. hopefully everyone will be more on point."}
{"text":"First time here.  In from KC.  We've eaten pizza in many cities. Great food. Excellent staff.  Had a Calzone, feta cheese melted into mozzarella.  Heaven!!!! If you're in Vegas and you want pizza. Must try! & BTW: Mayra the bartender is awesome."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch, very nice experience!!! Waiter was helpful (Cesar ) and explained menu as it was our first time! Had delicious ice tea, house salad and individual pizzas!!! Food came quickly and hot! Not a big selection for lunch pizzas or calzones but the basic!  Intend to come again and get a large one with more topping! A little more pricey than average pizza place but the service and added elegance (table cloths, cloth napkins) made it worth it! I recommend you try it if you like thin crust pizza, just the right amount of sauce and a crispy crust which I do love!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I have to say I was disappointed in Grimaldi's =(.  Let's start off by talking about the food.   The menu is limited to only pizza and salad, so we got both and they were just average.   They have no \"signature\" pizzas, it's all build your own.   The topping selection was very limited, so we ordered a large pizza  1/2 with pesto and kalamata olives, and  1/2 with ham and pepperoni.   They charge you for toppings on the whole pizza even if you only get them on half which is a little ridiculous, but whatever.  I ordered a side of red sauce to dip my pesto pizza in.  It was watery and flavorless, it needed garlic and salt! The only thing I can say good about the pizza is they use fresh mozzarella, so it wasn't greasy.   The house red wine was decent and a good price by the carafe, overall they had a nice wine selection.   Our server was friendly and prompt, and the atmosphere was cozy.  We had a big party so we had a private room.  Needless to say, after spending $65 for mediocre pizza, wine and salad, this is not a venue we will choose to go back to.  If you want a great place to go for pizza and wine in Old Town, skip Grimaldi's and go to Grazie, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you are a pizza lover stay away from this place! I could go into detail as to why this pizza sucks but that would be a waste of time just like this pizza was. A waste of money and waste of time going to go get it! I'm only give it two stars because at least the restaurant is clean and it seems like a nice environment to maybe enjoy a salad and wine but definitely not pizza!"}
{"text":"We shared a small caesar salad and a personal size pizza with sausage, mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes with red sauce. It was a perfect lunch for 2 people. The staff was awesome and the food was well worth the price."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and service.  The crust is my favorite but the toppings are impressive as well.  Try the white pizza or the calazone (light ricotta), you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Took Out a \"Don\" (pepperoni, Italian sausage , meatballs) for late night Sunday eats for the room and it was yummy....thin chewy crust pizza where you need to fold in half to eat.  Wasn't my first time and won't be my last..."}
{"text":"Wanted to get some Italian food Friday, saw the reviews and my wife ordered over the phone for pickup. Drove 5 miles there to find out there is hardly any parking available anywhere and had to park behind a carwash few hundred feet away. After getting inside had to walk to the corner of the very busy bar to pay for the take out. Asked the bartender if that was all the food my wife ordered, she said Yes. Drove back home to find out they completely forgot my daughter's food, called them back and was informed the food was sitting at the bartender's register the whole time! Drove another 5 miles back thinking they would at least comp the forgotten food but they put a $5 coupon for the next time!!! I'm not sure how they have such high rating, the Calzone and Mediterranean salad were tasteless, forgot my daughter's Caprese Salad and by the time I made this 20 mile 2 times round trip, she had already gone to sleep and didn't eat. And to top if off the bartender told me she has to get the manager's ok for any kind of credit or keep the $5 coupon. They can keep their stupid coupon since I'm never going back there again."}
{"text":"Went here on Wed night for nice family dinner. I previously visited original and iconic location in Brooklyn, so I knew exactly what to expect. Grimaldi's certainly didn't disappoint. We ordered classic margherita and it was amazing. Thin crust, melts in your mouth godiness. Service was quick and efficient. It was a tad overpriced, but that is expected when you are in Palazzo. I wish we had more time to return for another meal."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great service. Gluten free crust was good, lots of great toppings to choose from. Caesar salad was tasty and a small is enough for four to have a starter salad. Passion fruit iced tea was refreshing."}
{"text":"Good pizza and peroni.  Definitely I'll be back for anchovy pizza. Friendly service."}
{"text":"After 5 hours of walking and shopping at the LV Premium Outlets, we worked up a big appetite. On the drive home it was decided that tacos and guacamole from Chipotle could be a quick & easy dinner, but as we passed by the newly opened (1 month ago?) Grimaldi's in Boca Park, we made a last-minute decision to give their pizza a spin.  We order a small house salad ($5) and it is large enough to feed 3-4 people, so the two of us have plenty of green to eat. The house vinaigrette is not very vinegary, but the tomatoes and mushrooms are fresh and the whole green olives are good quality. We order a large, traditional Grimaldi's pizza with onions, garlic and jalapeños ($15 + $2 per topping = $21). As we wait for our pizza, a quick survey of the pizzas on other customers' tables make me a little nervous that the coal-brick-oven at Grimaldi's is over-baking their crust. Every pizza I see in the restaurant has dark-brown/black burnt crust edges. (Thinking that it will take a really resilient dough recipe to withstand that level of scorching, I will be very impressed if their crust is actually chewy/crispy!)  Our pizza shows up. The cheese looks great - it has that stark white color of good Buffalo mozzarella. Bonus fresh basil in the middle of the pizza! No visible grease puddles on or under pizza! Overall the topping quantity isn't terribly generous, but compared to Settebello's 'authentic' (i.e. totally skimpy) pizza topping distribution, I find no reason to complain. With the first bite of any thin crust pizza, I pray to the pizza gods that the crust will be perfectly 50% crispy and 50% chewy. Unfortunately, Grimaldi's crust is 80% crispy and 20% chewy, and by the time the pizza is half eaten (4 slices left) it stales and becomes 100% crispy, much like the crust texture of a Tombstone frozen pizza. How did this happen?!  The edge of the crust is unacceptably crunchy and flavorless (and burnt!) and the second half of the pizza left me wondering what went wrong with this pizza - how does a pizza crust take a total turn for the worse after only 10 minutes into a meal? We could have easily left 2 pieces for a togo box for next-day's lunch, but found ourselves in a better-eat-it-now-because-it-will-get-stale situation as the crust was already surprisingly stiff. I actually heard the crust *snap* all way down the middle when folding the last slice!   My favorite pizza experiences in North America have included a few special pies at Lou Malnati's (Chicago), Pizzeria Bianco (Phoenix), John's Pizzeria (NYC), Frank Pepe's (New Haven) and Pizzeria Rustica (Miami). In Vegas I have had good luck at Metro Pizza and at Rocco's NY Pizzeria, and the pear/gorgonzola/arugula/proscuitto pizza at the Sammy's location on Sahara is a consistently tasty choice. With respect to Grimaldi's, I could say \"maybe we got a bad pie\" but judging from the dozen other over-baked pizzas I saw on customers' tables, I think a baking-time or yeast adjustment could really help - the flavor is all there - the crust just needs a little chewy tweaking! Service is friendly and very attentive. Apparently, the cheesecake at Grimaldi's is homemade and as good as NYC Stage Deli's..."}
{"text":"This is always my go-to place for pizza. I have never been disappointed by this location or Grimaldi's in general. The pizza is always cooked perfectly and the service is always wonderful. The coal brick oven is my favorite cooking style for pizza and it never takes more than 10-15 minutes for the pizza to be ready. PERFECTION.   We always order a large pizza with pepperoni, garlic, and onions. Never fails. Always hits the spot. I probably eat here at least twice a month and it would be more often if I wasn't watching my girlish figure. ;)  PS: Sign up for their mailing list/VIP program : YOU GET A FREE LARGE PIZZA ON YOUR BIRTHDAY and they sometimes email you coupons! :)"}
{"text":"Dinner was great even though it got off to a very bumpy start. Our waitress was a total doll, and super attentive, and that's why we were able to laugh off her spilling a glass of ice water all over one of our tables right at the beginning. Our salad was supposed to come out first, but the \"salad lady\" was behind and the oven was going fast, so they came at the same time. Our waitress brought the kids pizza out right away and they even offered to remake our pizza if we didn't want the salad at the same time. They offered us a free dessert for the water and salad issues, and the manager came to personally check on us. The food was great and I love the space so much better than the one on Eastern we usually go to."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the food. It started with the attitude from both hosts at the door who rolled their eyes as we walked up 1 sat us never explained the menus, and just walked away.  then we waited about 10 minutes for the waiter to get our order. Someone different brought out the salad then another brought out pizza. The server came by 1 time to ask how everything was. Took 30 minutes to get him to get us a box then another 20 for the check. As we are sitting there waiting what I think are managers are walking around checking on every other table and we don't even get glanced at. This was my first and LAST time to ever come back. I have never been so pissed off about the service of a restaurant. I myself work for tips and have NEVER not left at tip and with this service I REFUSED to leave anything."}
{"text":"Just had the most DELICIOUS BBQ chicken pizza in OLD TOWN Scottsdale! Conveniently located on the corner of Scottsdale Rd. & 5th Ave... What an inviting, charming place to have pizza with friends during the week. Service was fast and friendly, even though they were busy on a Wednesday night. (NO wait!) I was very impressed by our server and her recommendations..even telling us about a special WINE night & inviting us BACK! Can't wait to go back & try some other unique flavored 'specialty' pizzas! YUM!! :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza and nice atmosphere but go there with an empty bladder. One bathroom for women and one for men!! Not enough for the weekend crowd this restaurant draws in!"}
{"text":"Unreal pizza. The most amazing and authentic Italian crust ever!  Simply perfect pizza.  Great service at a great price."}
{"text":"Brought our soccer team here for dinner. 35 people in our party. From reservation 2 weeks in advance (Casey) to the actual dinner, the service was impeccable!!!!  I will recommend this restaurant to everyone I know. It is located in the quaint area known as Old Town, perfect for walking off the best pizza I've ever had!!  The spinach salad had the freshest ingredients and the dressing was perfect!  The atmosphere......WOW!  So nice to sit in the courtyard under the breeze in November!  Did I mention that the service was terrific!!!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THE PIZZA!   And the mediterranean salad is scrumptious, too! This location is better than some of the others. The tables aren't so close together that you can actually walk through this one. I know people love eating at Grimaldi's but the other locations are so small with so many tables and people crammed together that I'm sure to catch someone's cold because I'm in their personal space. I recommend this location! It's delicious and sanitary!"}
{"text":"So here's the deal. I live six minutes from Grimaldi's by car, I needed a pizza fix on a lazy Tuesday evening about 8:45. As I walked in, the place was jumpin' with a nice crowd of families, couples and singles. I saddled up to the bar, met Karissa and promptly ordered a 12\" sausage, pepparoni and jalapena thin crust, coal fired pizza. SENSATIONAL is an understatement. I met the folks, got talkin' World Series baseball, business and life with the troops. After a bit I settled up my $21 tab and hit the road. Will I be back ?...there is no doubt...Grimaldi's in Old Town Scottsdale is a winner !!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great here. Service is also good and fast. I like their thin crust pizzas. The only think I do not like is the greasy smell inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend has raved about this \"Grimaldi's place for quite a while.  He goes for lunch a couple times a month and I've always said \"I'll try it sometime.\"  Part of the problem was that it's right by my favorite Mexican fast food place, Cafe Rio.  Well, tonight we finally tried the famous Grimaldi's and I'll tell you what, this is a \"I'll go on a diet tomorrow\" kind of restaurant.    We were the leading edge of the dinner crowd so no problem getting preferred seating indoors.  Quick attention by Anthony, our capable, informative and entertaining server.  When we declared our \"first time visitor\" status, he patiently explained the three different styles of pizza, the salads, and \"Oh, yes, we have calzone too!\"   We settled on a split medium, 1/2 ham/pepperoni and 1/2 pesto & jalapeno & basil (can you tell which one is the meat eater?).  Anthony wisely paired our selection with a Pinot Noir from Italy that matched perfectly.  So much so, we trusted him and got the bottle to finish at the castle (home).  Pizza is like sex, it's never bad unless you don't give it a chance.  And in this case, this was one of THE BEST PIZZA's I've ever had.  Timely, crisp, tasty, aromatic (and perfectly matching wine) and absolutely hit the spot.  I declared early that I would save room for Bailey's oreo cookie crust cheese cake.  I almost faltered and finished my 1/2 of the pizza which would have left me too stuffed.  But, I exhibited massive amounts of discipline and saved one slice for later consumpiton and ordered the heralded cheesecake (with two forks 'cuz I'm that kind of date).  Oh My GOSH!!!  This stuff should be on the front page of the Review Journal.  Seriously!  I'm not a big fan of sweets, but I can appreciate a near perfect taste when given the chance.  Presentation = 10, texture = 10, taste = 10 and memory = 10.  Well done, Grimaldi's!!  Before we left, we had the chance to give our thanks and kudos to Gino for having such an awesome place.  So maybe it took three years to finally try this place, it won't take very long before our next visit.  Well done everyone!"}
{"text":"I forgot to mention, you have to get lighter, less heavy toppings. If you get a lot of toppings or heavy ones like sausage it will be soggy.  It will be super crispy and good if you get the light toppings.   I also discovered if you go to the website and enter your email for the newsletter(which they actually dont send you)  You get all these free pizza coupons. They send me them all the time, and its with no purchase necessary.   http://Grimaldispizzeria.com"}
{"text":"Im sorry but if you eat here all pizza will forever be  ruined to you. Grimaldis is simply the best. And holy shit grass fed mozzarella.... that is amazing.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered a small pizza, which is great for two people. Half cheese, half pepperoni. I ate the entire cheese side, like a fatty. I ordered a half pint of wine, let me tell you, that's enough for two people. However, I ended up drinking all of it!  During my visit, the Venetian performers came around and sang to everyone, encouraging us to visit the show in St. Marks Square. I love the Palazzo and enjoy coming up to the shops, with so many unique restaurants and retailers, it's always a good time."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place out for awhile now.   It was super good! Any topping you do choose to add on does cost extra though. We had about 5 different types of pizza. We got The Garden and added sausage, pepperoni, ham & green peppers. It was delicious. The other pizza was just sausage it was delicious as well. The other pizzas were pepperoni, cheese & white garlic with grilled chicken & spinach. They were all delicious and the crust was amazing. So happy that the pizza didn't feel oily.   Also they only have pizzas, salads & calzones.  Also they do have seating available outside. Love their decor. Also they have wine glass bottles for the lighting which is really cool.   Tuesday's they have half off wines.  The Don pizza is amazing! The calzone is so good!"}
{"text":"So happy we stumbled onto this spot- best pizza in Vegas. Anytime we're in town, this is our new \"must\"."}
{"text":"The best pizza !!!! Service Sucked. . .  Service I would give only 2 stars."}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza: thin crust, NY, brick oven style. We shared the 18\" large with half white w/garlic, quarter regular, and quarter pesto to try all the sauces. Toppings were bacon, sausage, and pepperoni. Nice wine selection and decent beers on draft. I'm sad that the closest one to us is in Vegas from L.A. Very reasonable for a sit down restaurant on the strip. Didn't have the room, but they had cannoli, cheesecake, and tiramisu for dessert. Would definitely go again the next time we are in Vegas!

{"text":"Oh my cats!  Its Saturday 4pm on our way to Cardinals preseason game against raiders. Stop here for pizza. And. No pizza. They're cleaning the oven!!! Really on a Saturday!!!  Crazy."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great salads! Good service! (I know this is probably not the way to eat a good pizza, but I always need hot sauce with everything-- I wish they had Tabasco.)"}
{"text":"Just like I remember from Brooklyn. Tushumbe was a great waiter and the LI Ice Tea was numbing. Perfect dinner."}
{"text":"Sat next to the pizza making station and disturbed to see that they don't wear gloves when making the pizza...their  reaching in and out of the containers with bare hands and touching all over the pizza with bare hands... yuck"}
{"text":"Don't see what the big deal about this place is. The pizza is not that great to start with. On top of that bad customer service every time I have been here. Today \"Kristy\" the redhead working the To-Go orders ignored us when we walked, didn't say hello, and was rude throughout the whole transaction. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Las Vegas. Living in NY the other pizza in Las Vegas was, well ummm meh  After speaking with waitress she explained the magic they perform to the water to replicate NY water.   It's working girl.  Place feels like a NY restaurant and more importantly so does the pizza. Worth the wait.  Hey check it out."}
{"text":"They have great pizza, but today I was there (4:30 on a Saturday) and the hostess told us that we would have to wait 30 minutes for pizza since they were \"stoking the oven\".  My wife and I decided at first not to wait but quickly changed our minds and went back in.  The hostess then told us they were on a 45 minute wait....let me just say, the restaurant was almost totally empty.  In addition, the hostess was very aloof about her inability to serve her customers and quickly resumed her teenage chat with her friends once we decided not to stay.    I think someone should remind the staff that their business model REQUIRES that they sell pizza to customers."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. My wife started with a carafe of wine called Drops Of Jupiter.. She loved it (ended up getting some at Total Wine after dinner) and I had the house Bloody Mary, which uses pizza sauce instead of tomato juice, and garnished with pepperoni, cherry tomato, basil, and olives, VERY good. We started with Antipasto which was excellent!  For our pizza order, she had the gluten free Margherita, and I had the Margherita minus the basil, add kalamata olives. Now, mind you.. we are becoming pizza snobs, and are now on a mission to try the best of the best in Las Vegas. It will take a LOT to knock this pizza out of the top place, in my books. Not only was the pizza out of this world, the ambience, even being on a busy Friday night was just what we were hoping for. The service we received from Chelsea was impeccable!!!!  She was beyond helpful, and just a real sweetheart!  We will be asking for her every time we go back, without hesitation. I truly cannot think of anything bad to say about this place. To those of you who are saying this pizza wasn't good, it was too thin, it was too this, too that....  I'm telling you right now, Dominos, and Papa Johns..... IS NOT REAL PIZZA!!!!!  Say that over, and over in your head until you start to understand it.   We finished the evening with dessert, which is something that we NEVER do, and boy am I glad we did!  We shared a piece of butterscotch toffee cheesecake, and it did not disappoint one bit!  Paired that with a cup of amazing cappuccino, and I was one happy, happy man. Now, the food is not terribly cheap, but I have zero problem paying good money for good food, and even better service, and that's just what we got. I've paid more for worse food, and worse service.   If you happen to read this Chelsea, please know that we thoroughly  enjoyed our night, thanks to you and Grimaldi's. And we will take your advice and come back on a weeknight when it's less busy!  And the little tip about the certain time of day to get the best tasting pizza, we'll keep that to ourselves :-) Thank you again, and we'll see you real soon!"}
{"text":"Went here after eating at the one on the SE side of town and the one in Brooklyn.  Overall, it is very good pizza.  The crust is crispy and thin and has a nice flavor to it from the oven.  The toppings were good and flavorful, and they used real mozzerella.  The kind that has that discinctive look and taste to it.  The downside is the pizza is expensive and not that filling.  My wife and I split an antipasto, which was excellent and a large pizza with 3 toppings and it was $35.  For the two of us, we ate every last piece and were not exactly full.  The pizza is very thin, so honestly, a 16\" large is not that much for two.  If you have an appetite, you will need more than 1 pie."}
{"text":"My first time at Grimaldis was right next to the Brooklyn Bridge. I was so glad to find that there was one in Phoenix when I moved here. The pizza here is fabulous. The Don is the way to go. So fresh and so good. It just tastes like New York. Wine is a must have pairing with it. One down fall is the price. Wow that's an expensive pizza."}
{"text":"Came here Mother's Day with my two year old and friend, her treat. Never have tried this place but always wanted to.  Service was fast and friendly, they brought some play dough, literally pizza dough (eggless) for y daughter to play with.   One thing that annoyed me but its what lots of restaurants do is, stuck is in the kid section. It's not a real section, labeled but I know they do it on purpose. It's no coincidence that four different groups, including use we're sat on the left back side of the restaurant. Parents won't get bugged by other kids, I guess is the mentality. It ended up working out though seeing as the kids make eye contact and talk keeping one another entertained.  Pizza was good, a little too thin for my liking but I know that's the authentic by style. The pesto was rich, an they really laid it on. Delicious, especially once you paired it with sausage on top. My daughters picky and she loved it. Folding the pizza in half worked for her and kept the mess to a minimum. The personal 12 inch fed her and I and left two slices leftover and came to 12 bucks. Pretty good!"}
{"text":"After waking up from an evening nap, and not wanting to let a perfectly good night lapse without my leaving the condo, I decided to go get some pizza.  A couple of friends mentioned Grimaldi's, so I decided to give it a shot.  It was difficult driving right by my favorite neighborhood pizza joint without caving, and even more so when I saw the Macayo's (kidding!).  But I stuck with the plan, so here we are.  I was seated at a table, and took a glance at the menu while waiting for my server.  Then I took another glance, started figuring out what I want, noted the lame fountain drink selection, studied the menu more, flipped it over and glanced at the wine list just because, looked at the toppings again, made it half way through Marcel Proust's \"In Search of Lost Time\", assembled a small airplane, waited a little more, and finally decided that the server was not going to show up if I didn't say something.  The waitress finally showed up and apologized, explaining that she did not see me there.  Crap, I left my invisibility cloak on again! My bad!  Seriously, though, her service was markedly better after she became aware of the fact that I exist.  One thing I should note about the menu is that they don't have specialty pizzas that they have carefully crafted and deemed as worthy topping combinations.  I don't particularly care for this setup.  To me, an important part of cuisine is the whole art of the thing, and if you walk into a good restaurant, you are served something with the chef's personal touch.  You don't get that here.  I understand that some unsophisticated diners like to have the same toppings on each and every pizza, so it is fine that they allow you to pick your own toppings.  But all I'm saying is that they don't deserve any credit for that awesome pesto, artichoke, ricotta cheese, and mushroom topping combination I concocted.  The actual pie was fine.  This is a chain, and it is far better than most pizza chains I have been to.  Possibly even better than all of them.  But when they say their coal-fired pizza is better than wood-fired pizza, I have no choice but to compare them to the wood-fired pizza places.  In effect, they're entering themselves into a competition they can't win.  Because those places make artisan pies, and they cater to a whole different market.  Finally, the prices here are exorbitant.  They comped me for the poor service, and it was still $3 more than I would pay for a far superior experience down the street at Il Bosco.  A three-topping personal pizza with a crappy fountain drink will hit you at about $20 before tip.  This is absurd.  So there you have it.  If they stop acting like they're an artisan pizza place and drop their prices accordingly, they would run circles around the California Pizza Kitchens of the world.  But they can't compete with the Cibo's, Bianco's, Il Bosco's, or even Pomo's of the culinary landscape."}
{"text":"Great food and great service all around. They make you feel welcomed. Adam was our waiter and he has a great personality."}
{"text":"We eat here a few times a month. We usually order a small Mediterranean salad which feeds two & The Don\". It's topped with sausage, pepperoni & meatballs. It is a thin crust pizza with quality ingredients and is very tasty.    No complaints about service ever. There's usually a longer wait Fri & Sat night so don't show up starving."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here about a week ago. From the  moment we walked in the door we were greeted with a smile. This place is tops for customer service, everyone and I mean everyone is VERY friendly and helpful. We first sat at the bar while we were waiting for our table and the bartender explained the menu to us, we got seated and our waiter was great, the manager even came by and spoke to us for a while, other customers as well. Its not the cheapest place in town for a pizza but it is very good and the customer service is OUTSTANDING.  We had drinks, appetizers, pizzas and a desert that including a trio of their deserts and the total bill was around $70.00. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service.  First time there and server explained the whole menu.  Even went into kitchen to ask which onion was sweeter.  if you like thin crust pizza, this is your place.  Will be back for more."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love pizza and this is some of the best thin crust around.  Super fresh ingredients and the make their own mozzarella!  Kale salad was delicious too!"}
{"text":"So happy this worked into this visit to Scottsdale! We had tried the Far North Scottsdale location last year when we visited and I FELL IN LOVE...no joke, I would have it shipped to my home in MN if I thought it would travel well. But, alas, the best thing about coal-fired pizza is that you don't want to travel any distance or in any rush....just slowly take in the aroma and the flavour....and, if you're a fan of libations, a Peroni washes this down nicely at lunch as does a deep Cab Sauv at night :) I'm always happy to find red-and-white tablecloths in a pizza parlour....maybe sounds cheesy (ha!), but it just puts a smile on my face! The lunchtime hostess at this location was really excited about her job, the food, and the weather - what a great smile she has and how very welcoming she was that day for this party of one! I sat in the bar, was greeted promptly by a great waitress who knew exactly how much time to allow for decisions, and I ordered a personal pizza with 'choke hearts and kalamata olives. It came to the table sliced into 6 pieces and I honestly could have been finished after 2....but why would I deprive myself while on vacation? DUH! So, I ate a third slice and took half of the pizza back to our condo for a future snack.....lucky future snack tummies unite! Do your family a favor and take them to Grimaldi's :()"}
{"text":"Pretty elegant looking place inside, but unfortunately, I thought the service and the food wasn't really all that good.  I had the house salad along with the personal calzone.  Both portions were a good size, I couldn't finish either, and ate half the calzone for breakfast the next day.  The calzone comes with ricotta and mozzarella.  Anything else was extra.  What I don't get though is that the cost of the toppings for a personal is the same as that for a big calzone.   Same goes with the pizza.  Obviously this place doesn't cater to the lone eater or even for a couple.  The calzone was essentially tasteless, and the marinara that came with it I had to modify with a bunch of crushed peppers, salt, and black pepper.  It too really had no taste.  There's way better pizza in Scottsdale than this place."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a creature of habit when it comes to pizza. I'm a pizza lover and I know what I like. Grimaldis is my go-to place for many reasons.   1.  Service.  With few exceptions, the service here is always friendly and quick.   2. Fresh ingredients. Order the antipasto, you'll see what I mean. Fresh, cold, delicious salami, mozzarella, peppers, olives. From the gods.   3. Thin crust NY style pizza. Perfection.   4.  Huge wine list and choice of yummy cocktails.   I love everything about this place. I'm a fan for life."}
{"text":"After missing out on Grimaldi's in New York. I am glad I found one in Las Vegas. Its located in the Wynn hotel near the Cannal Shoppes.  Its tucked away in the back. Isolated by itself near some escalators. When you walk in you are greeted by a hostesses who will bring you to your table.  Its decorated a tad nicer then the Brooklyn location. Service was awesome, our waitress constantly checked in on us.  Food was ok and thats why I gave it the 3 star rating.  Red Sauce Pizza - Crust was better then New York, but the sauce was a tad tangy for my taste.  Garlic Pizza with Mozzerla - this was the star of the show. super flavorful and perfect with sausages.  It was an ok experience, I still prefer Basic Pizza in San Diego and Napolini over this."}
{"text":"I personally like this location over the other ones in town. It has a really nice outdoor seating area and a cute water fountain right in view. The atmosphere is calm and quite, no one is overly loud or obnoxious either. But if you can always sit inside too if the weather is unbearable. There's a bar area for watching the game (and my boyfriend was glued to it, as always)  I've been here twice so far, and each time the service was great! They were attentive and watching to make sure our drinks were filled and to give my boyfriend and I updates on our foods. The second I came here the pizza I ordered took a little longer than my boyfriend's. They brought his out and mine took another 5-10 minutes longer. Normally I would've have been kinda peeved, but our server came by and apologized and even offered to reheat my boyfriend's pizza because he waited for mine to come! That's what I call quality service!  The pizza has super thin crust and I was skeptical at first but it really complimented the pizza. I got a personal pizza with sun dried tomatoes and roasted red bell peppers. I love that they use fresh mozzarella cheese!   I love it when service is great and knows how to \"entertain\" so to speak. He was likeable and funny and needless to say he got a nice tip from us.  This place is worth a shot if you like pizza that doesn't come in a box."}
{"text":"In an unlucky turn of events, I ended up having a grand experience with my new favorite, Grimaldi's.   More of my reviews lately have began with me aimed for one place and ending up at another, and I'll start with \"this one isn't any different.\" Maybe it's a trend, maybe it's indecisive decision making, or maybe it's just plain old coincidence. Mostly because I don't believe in fate; I'll go with coincidence, but for those of you who mystify the universe in a shroud of hocus pocus, wizardry, and magic then feel free to call it fate.  While I make the claim of \"My New Favorite\" I'm not really comparing it to much outside of oreganos, humble pie, upper crust, and streets of new york. I've yet to visit bianco, cibo, and plenty other wild-west, pizza slingers round these parts.  Earlier this week I planed my birthday lunch at Cibo in Downtown PHX. A calorie and carb packed, delicious birthday meal. Much to my dismay, a quick pre-lunch look at the Cibo menu (on their website), seemed to be lacking a certain sauce and cheese covered, carbo loaded delight. After a call in confirming this fear, a fast yelping finger pointed me to Grimaldi's in Scottsdale. It didn't hurt that they had also sent me a voucher for free birthday pizza; I guess my wife signed me up for their email list. :-)  On Sunday afternoon; even though they were busily serving plenty of customers, there was no wait. I placed an order with the server for a manhattan while I checked out their menu. Regretfully I had to send my drink back, it tasted more like straight whiskey, and bottom shelf at that. I decided to go with the house red wine in stead; which was decent and chilled, a bit odd for a red, but it worked out well.  We dined on a large meatball, ricotta pizza and a large mediterranean salad. The salad was huge, big enough for 3 people to share, and each end up with 2 portions. The pizza came out with a perfectly crisped crust, evenly distributed slices or meatball and ricotta, and was delicious!  We finished off our meal sharing a blueberry cheese cake AND a canolie, it was my birthday after all. I cant say that I've had many canolies in my life, but if they're all this good, there will be an eternal place in my heart set aside for these delectible deserts.  Happy dining friends, and godspeed to all your yelping fingers!"}
{"text":"Great service. Pizza has delicious sauce and isn't soggy, possibly due to it being a thicker crust. Alcohol beverage prices are way too high, beers are served in a 12 oz glass instead of pint glass."}
{"text":"This is not a bad pizzeria... but it's not a great one.   I came here 2 weeks ago and had the chance to try many of the appetizers and pizzas!  (my friends had their wedding rehearsal dinner here).   The appetizers are truly disappointing... the salad was way too sour... I would give this place 2 stars since the pizzas are decent and the service is great.   I tried the meat lover pizza and chicken pizza, both were delicious but not spectacular.    Overall, this is ok.... a little overpriced and I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Grimaldi's ive been to (1st was the original in Brooklyn).  I consider myself a pizza snob having had the best ny slices at Lombardi's when I used to live in Manhattan. The crust here is done right. They bake it in a coal oven just like the east coast. Although not environmentally friendly, it brings out the crisp char (but still maintaining the chewiness)  I thought the sauce was zesty and delicious but very stingy with the toppings! How dare you charge $2 for spinach but put in like 2 leaves in there. Also not a fan of the pepperoni as it was too salty. The service was extremely slow and we sat there for 30 minutes before our waiter told us that they ran out of sausage. Would I go back though? Yes! As it's very hard to get a good slice on the west coast and Grimaldi's still holds true to their roots."}
{"text":"Came to try this place for the very first and was actually excited since I heard very good things about the pizza, but as soon as we got here it was all bad the hosts are the rudest I have ever seen!! Place was empty all the tables had a mess and nobody was making an attempt to clean or sit us down we waited 45 min for a restaurant that was empty!! Rude rude rude host I will never be back!! And dont deserve not 1 star cuz of the service"}
{"text":"I used to live in Brooklyn, 500' from the original Grimaldis Brick Oven Pizza.  They say that this pizza is based off the recipes from the original restaurant.  It tastes close.  Water is shipped in from NYC to give the thin crust that New York flavor. The server was great. Ask for Bryna. The restaurant is very clean.  We just ordered the pizza and salad.  Both were delicious.  I don't like cheesecake but my wife got some.  She said it was so good she wanted to visit Vegas again just to get this cheesecake.   I would definitely come here again. It you're visiting Vegas it's nice because it's not right on the strip.  You get to experience a little bit of what the city is really like"}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to celebrate here for his birthday, unfortunately he didn't receive the yearly bday coupon in his email. I've had great past experiences with Grimaldis being very accommodating and decided to call and ask the manager if he could do anything for us. The manager, Don told us there was nothing he could do and that my friend had to register again for the bday coupon. I don't understand how people with horrible customer service become managers. Won't be visiting this Grimaldis again."}
{"text":"OMG it was hard to find. I called while in the Fashion Mall, to be told that they weren't there. However, they have 2 locations (one is in the Fashion Mall and the Palazzo). The lady over the phone at the Palazzo location didn't specify this.  Overall it would have  been helpful on my feet, but definitely increased my appetite from walking in hot Vegas.  THE PIZZA ..was great!  A very thin crust, half white sauce with chunks of garlic , other side with red sauce and pepperoni on the entire pizza and basil. It was the best pizza in my life whether I paid for it or not. It was FREE, and worth finding in hot Vegas. I'll be back, and miss it already.!  Yummy.."}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place for NY but never had the chance to try it out till I stopped by Vegas. Now that I did, no regret there.   We stopped by right when they were first open to pick up our to go for the trip. The restaurant was empty at the time so our pizza came out right on the dot!   They have three sizes Personal (12\"): 6 slices Small (16\"): If you had Papajohns before, this is the same size as XL. If a personal can feed 2, small must feed 4?? Large (18\")  I ordered a personal for two people yet we still had one slice leftovers. That thing is huge yo! Even though it's thin crust, it still filled us up good. After trying out Lombardi in NY, which is also very popular for their pizza and now Grimaldi...NY pizza may not be the best to me anymore.   Grimaldi pizza was slightly better than Lombardi but it's not the best that I had. It was thin but wasn't crispy either. The sauce was nothing special. We got basil, mushroom & pepperoni as toppings and those were all good. And of course, all toppings are $2-$4 extra depend what you get."}
{"text":"Haven't had pizza in so long! Love me some Grimaldi's! The kiddos got theredough to play with and the pizza was amazing as usual!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience, the pizza was very tasty and Meranda (my waitress) was awesome!   Be adventurous, create your own pizza with non-standard pizza toppings.al of the ingredients were very good, fresh and flavorful. I ate too much of my entree to try anything else, but their deserts (that they make themselves) and their coffee seemed real tasty  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Our family was there over the past weekend Saturday September 20. Our Grandkids love to watch the cooks hand-toss the dough. We sat in the outside patio (a first) and it was very pleasant. We were given excellent service by Kimberly and the Manager made certain we were well taken care of. Although our pizzas did not arrive at the same time - it was worth the wait. The food and staff is always excellent. We come to Vegas once a month and this is our go to pizza place every time. Thank you and we will be back! Recommend to everyone if you want the best pizza in Vegas Go to Grimaldi's on Eastern!"}
{"text":"Been there once; hope to never return. Sub-standard pizza with a big price tag. At least the beer was cold"}
{"text":"If you like thin crust pizza, this is the place. Great patio area and bar has seating when sit down tables are full. Place is packed on weekends. So plan for that. Service is good, my glass stayed full."}
{"text":"This pizza is definitely better than your regular takeout or delivery (domino's, pizza-hut, the works). I ordered the:   - artichoke, tomato & basil pizza: really fresh, huge artichoke pieces and nice overall flavor. Does not taste that well when its reheated because you need to eat the veggies fresh, but definitely awesome right off the oven.   - sausage, peperoni and cheese pizza: super meaty, super flavorful and just as awesome when you reheated 2 days later. the pieces of mozzarella are whole (large thick slices) and fresh, not the shredded crap that you get elsewhere. full of pieces of sausage and peperoni, FRIGGING GOOD.   - the antipasto (fresh mozzarella, salami, olives, peppers, fresh basil and bread): the kalamata olives were really nice, the basil leaves were fresh and the peppers were cooked and had a garlicky taste. the huge slabs of mozzarella were fresh and went well when you added some extra virgin olive oil to it.   - canolis: BEST CANOLIS EVER. Super creamy, super crunchy, this dessert made me giggle with happiness.   - tiramisu: it was tasty (not the best, but definitely good). the cake part was moist and the cream was good but it lacked the liquor taste to it at the end.   Overall, good food and a great alternative to regular pizza. The pizzas here are never greasy, your hands (or the cardboard) never end up \"oily-shiny\" and it actually feels like its good for you. weird."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant here on Yelp while in Old Town on a trip. My kids and I ordered a personal pizza (which by the way is huge!) and a small in 2 different variations of topping.  Pizza is really good! If you are a fan of thin crust, oven baked pizza this place is a must."}
{"text":"We call this the \"good\" pizza place. Been here twice for take out only. The pizza is great and most of the employees that I've interacted with have been pretty nice as well.   Today I called and placed my order, when I came to pick it up, the order was wrong which is confusing because the girl on the phone read it back to me perfectly. And it was only two items- kinda hard to mess that up. Anyway, it was annoying, but not the end of the world. It just makes me have to wait longer.   The pizza does have great flavor. It also has a nice fire/char flavor to the crust. The slices are thin, but the pieces are large. I recommend getting an additional dressing if you get a salad to go. Half the lettuce literally had no dressing on it. The tiramisu is EXCELLENT. Seriously, get the tiramisu.   I would say that my biggest complaint is that it's pricey. $32 for a margherita pizza and a Cesar salad. It's close to home and it's the best option near me, so I'll likely continue to come here."}
{"text":"My favorite white pizza in the whole world. Tough to park and pick up it up so I use Door Dash when I am craving it and have them deliver it. Nice to dine in too, but again tough parking but worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza and service are always great. A bunch of local friends said this place was awesome and after visiting several times, I agree!  We always order a large with pepperoni and meatballs;  they make and slice their own meatballs.  Pizzas are always cooked to perfection and make great left overs!   Love Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is the absolute best I have ever had.  I have dreams about it.  The thin crust is crunchy outside, chewy inside, and flavored well.  Toppings are fresh and delicious, and don't soak into the crust.  Grimaldi's pizza has become my standard for all other pizza, and I highly recommend it.  However, the service we experienced this evening was lacking.  Our server seemed pretty occupied (he also had a large party in his section), and was less than attentive. We arrived at 6, ordered at 6:20, and didn't receive our food for another hour.  Understandable if the restaurant was full to capacity, but it looked only 2/3 seated.  Server was kind enough to check in and apologize for the wait, but still neglected to refill drinks throughout the evening.  We were done eating and had to wait at least another 20-30 minutes for him to come back and box up the food and present the check.   I would expect more from the service end the next time I'm dining here, but honestly the pizza is so good I don't think it would matter."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Grimaldi's.. You have changed the way I view pizzerias forever!   I walk into this location for the first time, I can honestly say it's a mixture of ambiance between The Olive Garden and a typical pizzeria. The moment I walked in I was greeted and seated. The service may be described as polite and respectable.   The food items ordered were a small pizza and a Mediterranean salad. The pizza had a THIN crust with mostly ingredients being the key volume piece in the pizza. The salad was delicious, fresh and filling.   Thank you Grimaldi's for making pizza an eatable food once again without the fear of endless bread enhancers! I no longer feel guilty for eating pizza and PREFER Grimaldi's thin crust over any other pizzeria's pizzas.   Great service, beautiful location and delicious food, five stars without a doubt :)"}
{"text":"We love the food, staff and atmosphere at Grimaldi's. They always make us happy when we go... Which is often. The food is appropriately priced but the pizza cost can get high if you add a large number of toppings."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in Las Vegas.  They cook the pizza in a stone oven I think, and its super hot, which mens the pizza is cooked through, but because of the short cooking times, they don't burn it.  All the pizza is thin crust, but they have both traditional and white with garlic.  They have a generous wine selection, which is good if you like wine with your pizza.  After eating here, I can't go anywhere else.  Even Settebello falls short of this experience."}
{"text":"Love this place, always order the Mediterranean salad , pizza with multiple toppings and desserts are delicious here. This place is clean, waiters, waitresses are polite and attentive.  Love the patio area its brightly lit and the bar area as well.   The free pizza on your birthday for customers who are signed up in their system is also a big plus.  The best thing about this place is that I know their food never disappoints."}
{"text":"I love the flavor of all of the food I always get. The service is great. Only downer is that they don't have ranch :( other than that I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Walked in with my family of 5 last night and we were sat immediately. The service was amazing and the food was even better. I highly recommend the new Margarita pizza with extra sauce... Mmmmmmmmm!!!! If you haven't been to this spot, you need to try it out!!"}
{"text":"You want Italian? You're no where near New York? Go to grimaldis. NY pizza at its  finest. Great service, great food, great venue. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I came here because a few people told me their pizza is comparable to New York pizza. I grew up in New Jersey and I really miss pizza like they make it over there. Let me tell you, this isn't New York pizza. Yeah the crust is thin and crispy, but that's all that's even close to comparable to New York pizza. I wish people wouldn't throw that kind of reference around when it comes to pizza but they do so oh well.  The pizza was good. I couldn't stop eating it after being full cuz the flavor was so delicious!!! Very flavorful and delightful!! I'd recommend it to anyone! The pepperoni was kind of spicy but it was fine. I really enjoyed it I'll be back for more!  We also got the Reese's cheesecake. It was so good!!! I actually think it was even better than the pizza! I feel like I gained 5 pounds after that meal but it was all worth it!!! I'd do it all over again!!"}
{"text":"Experience and food not on par with Brooklyn or Scottsdale. If you're looking for pizza in Las Vegas, this is probably a good spot but just saying that the experience / service and food is better at other Grimaldi locations."}
{"text":"Great pizza! This location on the 215 & Rainbow has an outside patio and the interior bar is attached, so it is like a huge bay window open @ the bar! Very cool!"}
{"text":"Have you ever had a girlfriend or boyfriend who would do anything for you when you first got together? However, after a while the newness wears off and that person stops doing the little things. Why is that?   This describes my relationship with Grimaldi's for the last year or so. On my first visit, customer service was on point, the pizza was cooked perfectly, and I couldn't have been happier. Aaahhh, those were the days.   A few nights ago, my family and I thought we would try to renew that spark with Grimaldi's. Instead, we were treated with unevenly cooked pizza (kind of doughy, yet burnt in some spots) and so-so service. Every topping other than cheese is additional $2.00, so the bill adds up quick. Add in the $2.50 per soft drink, and I was starting to feel like the meal just wasn't worth it.   The caprese salad as an appetizer was a great start to our meal-although it could have used a little salt. The crust is so thin that the pizza gets cold fast - so eat quickly. I will give Grimaldi's a solid 3 star rating, but am starting to wonder if they have just stopped trying to do the little things."}
{"text":"We had the combo meal...  This includes a pizza, salad and drink - good value.   Ordered the white pizza and tomatoes with Caesar salad - flavor delicious.   The Pesto pizza also good.   The 6 inch pizza is enough for me but add the salad and it's a full meal.   Ambiance good with standard pics on wall of famous folks and locations.   Service prompt and courteous.   Will be back again."}
{"text":"First time here tonight, compliments of my new friend, Tony.  The pizza was beyond good, no doubt the best I've ever had (and at my age, that's saying a lot).  Our server Bryna was Outstanding - she was amazingly calm while doing hectic duty - our compliments to her, and we shall ask for her again.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Wow truly amazed. My coworker and I were out in Vegas helping a new store open. We were going to stop at chipotle but stumbled upon Grimaldi's. So thankful that we decided to try something new. Great service and wonderful food!!!   The vibe is truly great beautiful restaurant. We created our own pizza and got a house salad. Our server was so nice and I believe the manager brought out our pizza. So excited for the one opening up in California. My coworker had been to New York and said it tasted just like it. Definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"People like to hate on this place but I immediately loved their pizza the first time I tried it. Since the first time, I've been here many, many times. I'm a fan of thin crust and their crust is thin and crispy. I really like their cheese and sauce.  Their small salads and large pizza are enough for 2-3 people. I usually get their Caesar salad & the regular pizza but their pesto and white pizzas are equally as tasty. It does get pricey for each topping $2-4 so usually get 1-3 toppings. They have a small, decent selection of beers and their cheesecake or Tiramisu is a nice finish to your meal.  I receive excellent service all the time. I like how they open the door for you when you come in and leave too. The only con to Grimaldi's is the damage to my waistline after!"}
{"text":"We came in this afternoon for lunch. We were greeted right away by the hostess (I wish I would have gotten her name) and the manager Robert. We were taken to our table  Immediately. And there we were introduced to Laurie our server. Who was not only super friendly and on her A-game but so very knowledgeable! She was able to upsell us a salad before our pizza. And the bus girl who was beyond FANTASTIC! Pre bussed our table after each course and even went to the bar to make us change. But what helped make this meal so memorable was while we were sitting there Robert came up introduced himself , asked us how everything was and even made us laugh before walking away. The food came out awesome! But more than anything today just blew us away with how on point, friendly and fun the staff and management is! Whatever you're doing, keep it up! We live in Henderson but when we decide to do pizza we will drive to this location over the other ones! Thank you so much you guys!  Also, make the bussed a server she's damn good! And your hostess should become a server too. Her personality shines too bright to not grow within!"}
{"text":"Simple menu, salads, thin crust pizza and calzones only, full bar, great service.  Our pizza's were very, very good and must try the garlic and oregano condiments too.  Pepperoni is the best I've tasted.  Our server, Nick, was extremely good"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We came here after a late night show on Christmas Eve and they took our order even they were to close within 5 minutes! Needless to say the service was amazing (we where served by Victor) and the food was really good. My only negative would be the ham topping for the pizza was a bit thick and salty, nonetheless it does not take away from the quality of the food, service and drinks. Would definitely come again! Also it is easy to find"}
{"text":"I had been to Grimaldi's in the past but I had to try it again since I couldn't remember. Once i ordered the pizza and took a bite, I instantly remembered how tasty and fresh the pizza was. The sauce is so tasty, fresh, and classic.   Was a bit disappointed with the caprese salad because it was pretty plain. Usually they drizzle olive oil, salt, pepper, etc on it already bit it seemed the tomatoes were also a bit too unripe   Pizza is great though! If you like thin crust with great selection of toppings, go here. Note that adding too many toppings can get a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza.  The small spinach salad was plenty for 3 people.  Blueberry cheesecake was delicious.  Jonathan was fantastic server, he made suggestions when asked.  We had a wonderful lunch!!!"}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by some friends. I'd always drive by it, but for what ever reason was never that interested in actually going in. Overall, the place is nice and has a very relaxing/social atmosphere. The pizza was not the best I've had, but definitely one that I'd like to eat again. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, but we will be trying one of the white/garlic sauces next. The wait time was a bit much, but I noticed the oven being pretty backed up with orders, which just tells you how busy and popular they can get. Now, the highlight for me was actually not the pizza, but an Oreo Cheesecake. I had just had New York Cheese from Carnegie Deli a few days before (one of the best, period), but Grimaldi's made in house cheesecake was just as good. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friend and I were at Fashion Show killing time prior to our flight home. As it was around lunch time, we decided to give Grimaldi's a try, and we are glad we did. The pizza was stellar. We ended up ordering The Don in the 12\" size and splitting the pizza. We both weren't super hungry and as we didn't want to take any food away, we opted for the smaller size. The toppings on the pizza were delicious, and the crust was nice and crispy. The strawberry lemonade I ordered was delicious as well.  Our waitress was Sabrina and despite the lunch time rush, she did not disappoint. Her recommendations were spot on and her service was top notch!  If you are at Fashion Show, definitely give this establishment a try! 4 starts out of 5 for a pleasant dining experience and receptive staff! Price was about what I expected and service reasonably quick. Definitely would consider dining at this establishment again."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza and a regular wine list (very good) and a break the bank reserve wine list.  Went for a Personal Pizza (12 in.) that starts at $9 and adding toppings increases the price.  Decided on a modified Margherita pizza and they do not skimp on the basil (HUGE plus!) The crust is nice and then and the pizza once ordered is delivered to your table in under ten minutes due to their ovens. The service is good as is the pizza and I think a good deal when you are in the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Best word to describe the lunch I had was \"Mediocre.\" In keeping with chain restaurants style, the food is very unimpressive. No outstanding flavors. Devoid of originality.   My house salad with grilled chicken was lackluster to say the least. The chicken was rubbery, lacked grill marks and coupled with it's  perfect shape & uniform cut strips leads me believe to they serve pre-cooked reheated chicken strips like the Tyson grilled chicken strips you find in a grocery store.    The only plus was the attentive and helpful wait staff."}
{"text":"Very consistent, thin crust pizza, made with fresh ingredients and excellent cheese! The market place is lively and the atmosphere is festive!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good albeit too thick for a Chicago thin crust aficionado. D'Agostino's in the Chicago area is our favorite. This is a NY chain with an extremely simple menu - 3 types of pizza (red, white or pesto) all with the same quasi thin crust dough and a layer of cheese. You choose your color base and then add toppings all for an extra charge - $4 for artichokes and a few other items, $2 for sausage, mushrooms etc. - regardless of pizza size - so you are best ordering the largest one possible and sharing it instead of ordering your own personal pizzas. The prep area and ovens are open so if you have a hankering for watching them put ingredients on dough you can do that. There are 5 salads (antipasto, Mediterranean, Caesar, House and a 5th I can't remember. That's it! OK - they do have wine, beer, Pepsi products and a few desserts (tiramisu and cannoli). All in all good but not spectacular enough to convert us to NY style pizza lovers and I would not return given the plethora of restaurants in this mall area."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Grimaldi's last night and there was a bit of a wait for a table, so we grabbed two seats at the bar. After the bartender Hannah talked to us, we decided to stay there to eat. She was super attentive and really friendly and the bar was actually more quiet than the main restaurant.   We had a bottle of the Layer Cake Primitivo, shared a salad and had a pizza with red peppers and meatballs. The pizza (as always) was cooked perfect. Love their thin crust and fresh mozarella.   The manager heard that we had a young baby at home, so he came over to talk about his kids and ours with us. He even comped our dessert! Both he and the bartender were really engaging and fun to talk to without being overbearing. They made our experience a wonderful night out--which is important when you only get one a week!   We've been there with a big group as well, and got our own little dining room that felt like we were all together at someone's home (without having to have someone cook or pick up!)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch 3 times. Ordered the large sausage meatball pepperoni pizza and medeteranian salad . Excellent all 3 times. Relaxing, excellent service and great tasting pizza. Excellent location to relax a walk around the palm tree lined streets and browse the shops. Parking is free in the indoor garage one block from GRIMALDI'S. Like being on a European vacation having lunch"}
{"text":"1st time to order here. We just did pick-up. Impressions are as follows:  - restaurant inside looks nice and clean - staff was nice (though I've only dealt with just Ashley at the bar for my to-go order - we ordered half Margharitta and half Garden. Pizza was thin crust and over all tasty. My family enjoyed it! - best of all is the restroom looks well maintained. Which to me says a lot as to how the rest of the restaurant is managed.  We'll come back for more :)"}
{"text":"Pizza like a boss in Vegas at a place you'd imagine would be in a mall within Iowa or something.   Wasn't impressed with the beer or drinking list...kinda weird to see them serve nothing too special within a restaurant at the Palazzo. Guess it's for the feel.   Point is; pizza was great. I hadn't had good pizza since my last trip to NYC and living in the middle of a college town for work now kinda gives me no real options for good pizza in Ken-tuck-he.   Good pizza, decent atmosphere."}
{"text":"Ok, right now I'm eating some left-over Grimaldi's pizza that I just took out of my fridge.  It was from my lunch early today.  I almost mistook the cardboard box for a slice of the cheese pizza.  The pizza they served was thin crust and was a bit watery.  This place is A-OK enough that it left me as humorless as an average review.  So, quickly:  + + +'s: ample seating, outdoor enclosed patio with trees & those quaint x-mas-like lights, clean, brick-oven cooked pizza, bar area, located in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale  - - - 's: service (quickness & attitude) could be better especially as I was the first customer in there, pizza costs can add up quick ($2 per topping), pizza was nothing to write home about  In sum, if you are looking for pizza sit-down and don't want a long, if any, wait this is an option.  If you are looking for delicious pizza with a fun atmosphere, I'd try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza, with sausage and extra mozzarella cheese. Lunch size house salad sharable."}
{"text":"On of my favorite pizza places! Me and my husband love the coal fired brick-oven pizza style and they have a great NYC atmosphere.   Pro tip: We always order the crust well done because it has a tendency to get soggy in the middle.  And if you're in the mood for a refreshing drink, you can't go wrong with either the white or red sangria.   For an appetizer, we stick to the caprese, simple but delicious. I am disappointed that the mozzarella slices have gotten smaller over time and isn't proportionate to the tomato and basil.   My cousin who lives in New York always raved about Grimaldi's and how the line would wrap around the block. Glad the line doesn't do that in Vegas, but I'd totally wait!"}
{"text":"I am from Jersey originally so I am always on a quest for good pizza everywhere I go outside the tri-state area. Grimaldi's nailed the pizza from the crust to the sauce and toppings.   Service was attentive and quick. When I ordered wine, he suggested we get a bottle as it would be cheaper than getting it at our hotel or elsewhere on the strip. I took his advice and that $23 bottle of wine was exactly what I needed. It was by far the best priced wine in Vegas. They also recorked it for me and I took what was left with me."}
{"text":"One word: DELISH. I don't eat much bread and if I am going to indulge in pizza, it had better be damn good. Grimaldi's did not disappoint. We were short on time and rapid-fired our whole order on first sight of there server, who got the message and did her best to bring everything out expediently and with perfect timing - plenty of time for the fresh house salad (key to get veggies into the kids before pizza, so we appreciated this) followed by well-worth-the-indulgence thin crust sausage pizza with spinach. I'm a sauce girl and was not disappointed!! I don't give 5 stars on the first visit (unless I am left completely speechless) but don't recall anything I didn't like - this joint is a WIN. Just go."}
{"text":"Can I just say I love this place!! The pizzas are ginormous and delicious!! The wait staff is really friendly and seem to enjoy being there too. The busser Steven is super helpful as well. And if you sign up with them, you receive a free pizza of your choice for your birthday up to $18. Check this place out..it is all around Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great place for pizza. Been to a few around the country and the food is always great. Service at Vegas location was good. Waiter was attentive and cordial. Will definitely go back and definitely recommend to others (which I did while there)."}
{"text":"Wasn't worth the 1hr wait at he front door in direct sunlight-AC can't keep up in this building-miserably hot inside, couldn't enjoy the meal. Recommend fired our for same tasting result less time better service."}
{"text":"This is the pizza by which all other pizza is judged. Period!  Coal-fired oven + fresh mozz + San Marzano tomatoes = pizza perfection."}
{"text":"Ok so I'm only dinging this place one star because the staff seems lazy and slow and the prices are a bit pricey. Def just a once in a while treat place... The pizza is always fresh and the salads are ok. They're a little stingy on the dressing so just ask for extra.  I love how you can choose your style of sauce and toppings and such. I love their meatballs! And how they have roasted garlic!  The beers on tap are always nice and cold.  Good location but never any parking."}
{"text":"A-OK. I wish the menu had more options. It's either pizza or salad. The dining room is huge so if every other restaurant at the Quarter is packed you should be able to find a table here. I thought the pizza was OK but not extraordinary.  This would be a great place to go if you have kids who like pizza and don't need video games and indoor playgrounds to stay entertained."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and always thoroughly enjoy everything.   The pizza excellent... they have a open kitchen so you can watch the pizza's going in the wood fired brick oven.  They also have a good wine selection."}
{"text":"Ordered large pepperoni and mushroom pizza to go. The speed of service was fast, but they were a little disorganized with getting the pizza to us. So not a fan of the takeout process.   The pizza did have a great tasting sauce, the ingredients tasted fresh, and I liked the flavor of the crust.  We will probably be back."}
{"text":"Well I went in for lunch to use my birthday coupon. I love Grimaldi's. However the last few times not so much. Today the crust was so tough I could not cut it with my fork. It was bland and lacked flavor. We ordered the white pizza however I think the forgot the white sauce. Our waiter was nice and kept our tea full. I was sad that the pizza was lacking. It still cost me $22 for two iced teas and pRt of the pizza price and tip. I think I won't be going back if I can help it."}
{"text":"Thin sliced new York style pizza! Was arguably the best pizza I ever had! Will have to go back again to confirm. All the topping were fresh! Atmosphere in restaurant was great! Service was great.highly recommended"}
{"text":"Traditional Pizza with pepperoni and mushroom just to compare how good their pizza really are. Well, Its delicious  thin crust , not the regular store bought pepperoni, great sauce with a sting of spice, fresh mozza cheese and the mushroom. Thin but its good, or you want the other pizza joint that's all bread with the same ingredients supplier/store that's exclusively available for all business owner here in Las Vegas? I should know I used to run one."}
{"text":"Called to see about a reservation for 8 at about 5 pm, but they only take reservations for larger parties.  Got there at 4:40, but they were stoking the coal  oven, which wouldn't be ready til about 5. Our server, Saleem, I think was very welcoming and informative. Not crazy about how drink runners interrupted us to auction drinks as they came out, and that staff did not yield to guests to let them pass. The pizza was great- crisp tasty crust, not too thin or cracker like, zesty sauce and great quality toppings we had the Don with amazing Italian sausage, pepperoni and meatballs, and the one with sausage, peppers and ricotta- both great! Cannoli made to order and perfectly crispy. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Having initially visited the original Grimaldi's in NYC, I had somewhat high expectations going into the new Grimaldi's on the Strip.   I must say the service was faultless, our waiter was so helpful. Me and my boyfriend shared a bottle of Italian red which went amazingly well with the pizzas. We ordered a pepperoni pizza and and italian sausage pizza...which, to be honest, was pretty good.   However, this place just does not compare to NYC Grimaldi's. Personally, I think its the tomatoes they use...it doesn't do the pizza any justice."}
{"text":"Grimaldis is my go to place for good quality thin crust pizza. They always send me a coupon for my birthday , which is really sweet. Special shout out to  our server Anthony who was very attentive and went out of his way to make sure our drinks and food is good. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've seen how packed the place gets on a Friday night but have only been during their less busy time. Staff is very friendly and actually seem genuine, the menu is simple, and pizza is great. Love the decor and big open window at the bar and watching others' kids get a kick out of watching them make the pizza. The only downside (and not a big deal) is they don't have ranch dressing...I'm a ranch fiend but it's probably on purpose for those of us who ranch their pizza . Pizza is still delicious without it."}
{"text":"Seated at table right away, but after 13-15 mins had to get up, walk across to the bar and ask a server to wait on us. They hadn't even acknowledged we were there yet... no \"we'll be right with you\", no \"can I get you a drink while you look at the menu\", nothing... felt like we weren't even there!!  And only about 1/3rd of the tables were full. Ordered a small simple 2 ingredient pizza which tasted pretty good, but had to wait 45 mins for it to come. Keep in mind that these brick oven pizzas, with the extreme heat and as thin as they are, cook in about 6-7 mins.  No complaints about the quality of the food, but the unexplained wait for no reason and worst service in yrs means I can only give 2 stars for this particular location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Grimaldi's pizza. I haven't had anything else but the pizza it isn't overly salty and doesn't leave me feeling ucky after eating it like many places with overly potent salt. Staff is all very nice and sweet too. Thank you grimaldis you make our week."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  The pizza is nothing better than average.  Anyone from NY will tell you it takes much more than a thin crust to make an NY pizza.  The service was very good and the Caesar salad was fantastic.  My quest for good pizza in Las Vegas continues."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had...ever. That's saying a lot seeing as how I'm from the Bay Area - the land of Zachary's! This, however, was every bit as delish. My boyfriend and I went on a Friday night at around 6:30 and got a seat at the bar. We split a caesar salad and a small pepperoni & sausage pizza. He had beer, I had wine - all in all a wonderful experience. In fact,  we're going back tonight! :)"}
{"text":"Really bad service. Not rude service, everyone who attended to us was actually very nice, clueless, but very nice. Our salads were delivered 5 minutes before our water and the two bottles of wine we ordered. I could have lived with that if, I had actually been able to eat it, But we had no silverware.  When our wine finally did appear it was the wrong two bottles. Our server asked us if we were sure that we knew what we ordered.  Eventually the correct wine appeared.   The salads were fresh and tasty.   The pizza was also very good.  Our server never came back to check on us, but another employee did,   It took a while to get our check.   I wish I could give Grimaldi's three stars because the food was good, they have a nice patio, and an outside bar. The service was not good, but I chalk it up to poor training.  I never saw a manager or anyone who appeared to be in charge, so I am reluctant to place the blame squarely on the wait staff. Attitude goes along way, and even though they appeared to be struggling, they were always smiling.  If I am ever back that way, I'll give it another shot, because the pizza was that good.."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for a FREE Birthday Pizza. Went here since we were in Scottsdale for business. Seated right away. Server was right there for drinks. Brought same and placed order. Salad was brought within minutes. House salad $7 but large and good. Less red onions (too strong and over powering).  Pizza arrived super hot. Love the small pepperoni slices. We had the large white pizza (did I say FREE) and it was outstanding. I used to like Red Devil's white but this was so much better due to the wood fired oven. A big 5 stars for the pizza. Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars was because the young lady who was our server after we were served seemed more attentive to one gentleman sitting by himself, like he was selling her something. Had to gain her attention twice to get the amount on the bill corrected. Still gave her a 25% tip (on total bill before coupon) due to the food and prior service. Wish we had a closer location in North or Northwest Phoenix.  Will be back next time by a location."}
{"text":"--General This place was actually pretty hard for us to find using Google Maps. The pin landed in the middle of nowhere and we walked around for quite a while before realizing it was IN the Fashion Mall (lol). Decently priced for its quality, probably one of the most popular pizzas in the States. There is a lot of history with Grimaldi's. Especially in New York and all that -- I can't really tell you about it since I don't know specifics but you can ask their waiters and they're very helpful! Great food and great service  --Food This place has really consistent, solid pizza. If you're in the mood for pizza do not hesitate at all to head to Grimaldi's. Probably some of the best classic pizzas you'll have."}
{"text":"So this was a first time visit for me. Was greated immediately by a extremely friendly host,Quickly taken to a table and given a menu. We were told out waiter would be right with us. Time had passed and we were ready to order. The host noticed that we were looking around and came and grabbed us some drinks and our waiter . the waiter was a little rude and seemed rushed. However the food was amazing and quick to come out!. But when we were finished we were left looking around for our waiter so we could get the check. They cook the pizzas in the front of the restaurant for people to see but all I seemed to notice was three employees huddled around a cell phone laughing and not paying attention to the customers. Like I said the food was fresh a d amazing but I wish the host was the server because she was the friendly one that noticed we were not getting service."}
{"text":"Somehow we stumbled upon this place, I forget what we were looking for in the first place. We had all had a little too drink before hand and a long wondering around looking for some mysterious place and decided this would do fine. Pizza sounded great.   This is definitely a family place and very, very, very loud. That served us well because my friend kept getting into a drunken argument with our other friend and was not using family friendly language.   The food itself underwhelmed. I love pizza and have grown up with some amazing pizza places near me. The sauces this place had sounded delicious, and it was thin crust which is o so delicious. However what killed me was that you get the sauce and cheese and that is it for free. Every topping costs no less then $4. $4 for a topping! Are you kidding me? Even the fanciest pizza place I love back home gives you two toppings for free, and then charges you at most $2 depending on the topping. I felt like it was highway robbery to pay that much for toppings, but held my tongue.   When the pizza came I have to say it was good, but not great. The flavors were there, but not in a BAM way. It was a decent pizza but lacking a lot of umph and punch.   Overall it was forgettable meal at a very unforgettable price."}
{"text":"We love the Grimaldi's in New York, and have been to their Vegas location twice now. Have always been able to find a table, even though they dont take reservations. The pizzas here are super amazing, specially the one with sausage. The service is prompt and friendly. They also have good collection of wines and at a decent pricing. Located conveniently in Palazzo with amazing decor outside, which you can admire while having food inside."}
{"text":"We went in for pizza for lunch. I had a free 18 inch pizza for my birthday. This was my first time eating Grimaldis as I am from Chicago. Their pizza was delicious, not too greasy or cheesy. The pizza was cooked just right. I'm not a big fan of onions and their onions are nice and sweet. I would definitely come back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"They are the best pizza along with the best service.  My favorite pizza place in Las Vegas.  Thin crust is the way to go. :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza sauce I've ever had and pizza is my favorite food.  I've had pizza in big cities all over the world, including pizzas in Italy, and Grimaldi's is amongst the best I've had.  Super fresh ingredients, including basil, top shelf mozzarella and a super thin, yet crispy crust.  The brick oven bake is definitely the way to go.  The manager came by and checked in with us while we ate, which was indeed a nice touch.  This pizza isn't super cheap, but it's worth every penny and is about 1,000 times better than Metro Pizza and is actually quite a bit cheaper too!"}
{"text":"Their main menu consists of Pizza with a small selection of antipasto, and salads. This establishment has a following; always has a wait on the weekends. Decent wine list. TV at the bar. Pizza is good. Service is good! Great outdoor seating and an area for large groups."}
{"text":"We come here a lot and we stopped by tonight for a birthday dinner for my wife and I. We decided to dine in and take advantage of our free bday pizza coupon. We had to wait as they were getting a table ready which is no big deal; this is where it went wrong. We sat down and the table was still covered in crumbs from the last table, a plate was dirty, then our sever came over.  She took our drunk order and remove the plate, no apology, no big deal. When she brought the drinks back and took our order she gave a bit of an attitude. Then she got a larger table and we almost never saw her after that, but could hear her schmoozing it up with them. When she finally came back I asked if I could have a beer and a new water as my glass had something in it. She took the glass and again no apology. 10 minutes a later I got my beer which I could see was at the bar waiting and she took numerous drinks from there to her other tables. The beer was like warm at best.  We ordered 2 large pizzas which came at completely different times and delivered by two different people. The pizza, however, was amazing as usual.   We asked for our remaining pizza to go, our server stacked the two pizza tins on top of one another smashing one pizza, and then placing dirty dishes on top of the other pizza. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I wouldn't have believed it. We didn't take the leftovers. Despite my suggestions my wife did leave a tip.   From now on we will only be getting pizza to go because of this, hopefully anomaly, terrible service. We were so disappointed as we usually get amazing service every time we go."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant while shopping at Old Town Scottsdale and it was very good. We had a bacon , mushroom, and black olive pizza which was excellent. The service was excellent as well. Our waitress was friendly , the meal came quick ,the staff was very attentive. The decor in the restaurant was also very nice. The only drawback was that the tables seemed too close together ( we had a table for two against the windows and it seemed like the backs of the chairs were almost touching each other) I really liked the restaurant and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!   I guess I should elaborate beyond my one word statement. We went to Grimaldi's for lunch on our second day in Vegas. This was our first time and won't be our last.   Our waitress was Selina and she awesome. She made sure to explain to us how the menu works and what they were known for. She also warned us that their portions are huge and are meant to be shared, family style. I really appreciated her advising us because when on vacation I hardly eat left overs and I hate wasting food.   My husband and I shared the small Mediterranean salad and small traditional pizza (toppings: ricotta cheese, pepperoni, sausage and jalepanos). Since it was early for us we decided not to drink any alcohol but I did check out their wine list and it is extensive and very reasonably priced.   I know Vegas is not cheap but this place is probably a great way to stretch your money and have high quality food.   Two thumbs up for Grimaldi's food and to our server Selina."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizzeria is my new favorite place to get pizza.  I usually go with my family and here's what we order.  We share the Mediterranean Salad.  It is big enough to serve four people with a little extra for who is hungry.  That would be me.  Romaine lettuce, olives, feta cheese onions etc.  The dressing is very light and refreshing.  For pizza, we order two personal sized pizzas and that feeds four people with a little extra for who is really hungry.  That would be me AGAIN.  This pizza goes down easy.  It's great tasting pizza with delicious sauce, fresh toppings, and thin crusts that do not leave you bloated with dough.  The wait staff remembers my family and we are greeted when we enter and throughout the course of our dinner.  A past waiter will always drop by to say hello.  The wait staff are very attentive and are true professionals.  This Grimaldi's location is in the new Park West shopping center.  Check it out.  This location gets packed on the weekends and week nights draw a respectable crowd.  Grimaldi's is one of the reasons."}
{"text":"Went to a holiday pizza party here last night.  We had about 50 people and lots and lots of food.  They served 6 different pizzas, 4 orders each, for a total of 24 large pizzas.  They also served 3 different salads, in large serving bowls -- I think they filled the bowls again.  My purpose is telling you this is because I felt the servings that were ordered and delivered were very generous and filling -- nobody went home hungry last night.  HOWEVER -- I felt the food was rather bland.....not bad, not terrible, just bland.  The pizzas did not have enough seasonings and even salt on them.  Normally the cheese is salty too, but not last night.  And the salad dressings, all three of them, were rather bland.....to me, there was enough olive oil in them, but not enough seasoning and vinegar.  All-in-all, I thought it was a nice party with lots of food, but for the price, I don't think I would go back again."}
{"text":"This is the San Tan location.  Nice setting and we got good service.  But again, just like the Scottsdale location, I thought the pizza was average at best and a bit pricey.  We also ordered the small spinach salad with genoa salami, and it was $10.  It was good, but not $10 good.  All-in-all, it was an OK meal, but not the greatest food for the price."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much walking in tbh, being from Chicago and all but whoaaa.. my friend Al Capone would be proud of this place. The thin crust white sauce and red sauce pizzas are crispy and doughy with just the right amount of kick in their sauces, I was surprisingly pleased!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER!!  Service can be hit or miss, but once that pizza is sitting in front of you nothing else matters.  The Grimaldi's house salad is also delicious.  But seriously, if you like pizza, you MUST try Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Always great here. Shared a Caesar salad and a pizza. Fantastic as usual. Place was packed but no wait for a table. Outside tables with heaters empty as it was just too cold Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"While being very excited to try this restaurant out, I was highly disappointed from the get-go. When checking in we were told \"up to 15 minutes\" to get a table outside. Mind you there were four open tables outside and several inside at the time. 40 minutes later we finally got our seats at a table we had been watching open the whole time. We stood close by the host table when we heard our name for the first time being called as \"last call\". How could we have missed it when we were standing right there watching several other groups being seated before us? Upon being seated we were greeted promptly but after that, our waitress was few and far between. After ordering our first drink, we didn't see her to order our dinner for over 20 minutes. While watching tables around us who ordered after we did receive their food before us was frustrating, I have to admit their pizza is awesome. Until the waitress realized she forgot our next round of drinks. The pizza is terrific but the service is horrendous! From now on, to-go orders is the only way to go."}
{"text":"Classic good pizza, you can actually taste the fresh ingredients"}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza. Best if eaten hot. Pizza oven is heated with  Charcoal so the pizza tastes bbq'd."}
{"text":"Even better than the grimaldi's in brooklyn, ny. pizza pie is tender, flavorful, and the crust is oh so delicious with that thinnly sliced bubbly mozzarella. Sometimes less is more and the cheese pizza is the best."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot because its really nice and cozy.  The waitress was really nice and attentive to our needs because we were a very demanding group. We ordered a small caesar salad which is perfect for two people and a small mixed green salad which didnt have the best dressing. Lets get to the PIZZA!! We ordered 2 large pizza, the first one was with a 1/4 pepperoni and the rest was cheese. The first pie was too saucy but still really good. So we ordered another pie which was too cheesy.  But what I liked about their pizzas was that the crust was thin and crunchy and the cheese was not shredded mozzarella cheese, it was buffalo mozzarella which made the pizza soooooo much better!!!!  Yummy Grimaldis...."}
{"text":"I'm a super fan of the original NY location.  I almost died when I saw a Grimaldi's in vegas!  I didn't know they had other locations.  I was skeptical at first, thinking it couldn't be as good, but it was very true to the original.  I would give it about 85% the same.  The waiter told us that they did have the coal oven and that the water was calibrated, by a chemist, to be exactly like the Brooklyn water haha.  It was awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly and professional staff. Questionable management.Had dinner outside last night. Waited one hour to get our pizza while watching so many people walk by us with pizzas in hand. Ate a soggy salad. Why not take care of sitting customers first? Give callers a wait time."}
{"text":"If my rating was based on food alone it would have been 5 stars.   The food is excellent! We usually eat at the Glendale/Peoria location and it was our first visit to this Scottsdale location. It was a Saturday night, so it was jam packed and my fiance and I waited about 40 min.  They seated us right next to the kitchen where all the pizza's go out and it was a little nerve racking, wondering if I was gonna get smacked in the head with a pie. Once our server got our order, I didn't see him for the rest of our meal. Two different servers delivered our pie and calzone and another one got us a box and the check. I did look around once, when my fiance's beer was empty and my water was getting low and our server was leaning against a wall chatting with another employee.  I'm chalking up the not-so-great service to it being crazy busy, and we'll definitely go back because of the food, but I doubt at this location."}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Great place to have pizza, really good. We have been going often and they also have rally good wines. It is always packed up with  people so sometimes is challenging to park but it is worth go round and wait. The best pizza you can get in AZ"}
{"text":"Once again the food and service were incredible. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, Mom ordered a white pizza and we shared a Caesar salad. Butterscotch cheesecake was sweet and decadent. All were phenomenal and ensured we will return. But better than that was the service.   Although a little shaky at first, service was incredible. No ill will though, as it was a busy Friday night.   Our server Wes and manager Stefanie were amazing. Great service ensures we will return."}
{"text":"Stellar culinary creations combined with stellar service make for a winning team. The pizzas are always packed with flavor, whatever you're in the mood for, so no fears when you dive into the delightful menu.  Best thing to note is the service. It's rare to find sincerely friendly, attentive servers but they are certainly here. The staff is well taken care of by management and it clearly shows."}
{"text":"What a debacle last night was.   Sure we had a few drinks in us but we were responsible and clear headed enough to decide to get some food in us before bedtime.    It was peak dinner time but there were 2 hosts who told us it'll be about 30 minutes.  We sat at the bar to wait for our table figuring we'd hear them or they'd get us when there was a table.  Apparently not.  What do they need 2 hosts for?   When I asked the bar tender about ordering at the bar since we'd been waiting for our table for almost an hour she said she'd check on it for us.  15 minutes later I was starving and a little more unhappy.  The party next to us at the bar was enjoying their pizza while we were starving and trying to get a pizza for about an hour.  The bar tender who had never really said anything about our table or asked what we wanted says well I dropped off these menus for you.   That was it.  I knew what pizza I wanted to order when I walked in and now over an hour and a half later I was too tired and too hungry to deal with it.  As I think about all the people involved and all the things that could have gone better I get increasingly upset at their treatment of us.  We're young and we're tipsy but not annoying drink people to just shoo this way and that.  You're located in old town for God's sake.    And why are there 2 hosts and why if they don't even look for parties waiting for tables??"}
{"text":"Had the pesto pizza, flavors would have been good but the crust was burnt black. Guy said that is the way NY pizza is supposed to be. Been to many NY pizza places including John's.. This place does not know NYC pizza.."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place for family dinner where I can unwind with a glass of wine, and my kids and husband can enjoy great pizza."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza and capresse salad here!  Everything is so fresh and tasty.  The pizza came out fragrant and oh so delicious.  And the salad had huge slices of sweet tomatoes where you can drizzle as much olive oil and balsamic vinegar as you desire.   This is a really cute sit down pizza place with ample space and a clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"This pizza is the best I have ever eaten.  My girlfriend said the same thing."}
{"text":"Special thanks to waitress Ashley for taking outstanding care of my family of 16 tonite!  What fantastic service....outstanding! Add to that wonderful salads and delicious pizza, and this place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Amazing thin crust pizza coming from a very power coal brick oven. Great service and nice classic pizzeria feeling."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Hot fresh and delicious. A great way to celebrate Mother's day."}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner to meet one of JD's buddies new girlfriend. We were the first to arrive and it was packed but smelled awesome. We had a drink at the bar and when everyone else showed up about 10 minutes later the table was ready. JD and I split a small house salad that was plenty big enough for the two of us. I then had a personal pizza with meatballs and ricotta that was fan-freakin-tastic! I won the \"best pizza\" at the table award according to everyone. I was more than happy to share because the personal pizza was way too big for just me. The other pizza's at the table were good too, but not as good as mine! Im getting hungry just thinking about it!   The service was prompt and friendly and the food came out fast. The only downside was that the women's restroom was broken and you had to go outside to a \"free for all\" bathroom that was kinda gross. I dont understand people who don't flush. Anyway, that is the sole reason I left off one star. Hopefully the next time I visit that will be amended."}
{"text":"I've been to another Grimaldi's and this one was a disappointment. First off, why the hardcore full court press sell to buy wine, salads, and something from the bar? If we wanted any of those items we simply would've ordered them. We were not asked once to order these items but twice. This is a pizza joint yet it really felt like going to an Olive Garden where one is pressured to buy an appetizer, cocktail, or dessert in order to jack up the bill. Ridiculous.   Now, the pizza.  The pizza was mediocre at best and certainly not up to snuff at the other Grimaldi's location we've been too. Ordered large sausage pie but it was really light on the sauce and the cheese. I actually like sauce all over my pie and cheese as well but the cook just drizzled on the sauce and then filled in the gaps with cheese. In other words the entire pizza was not covered with sauce or cheese. Also they usually put a decent amount of fresh basil on their pizzas but not this time. Maybe two small pieces of basil on an entire large pie? Very disappointing and as a result of my wife and I will not be back to this location.   I guess we will pay a couple bucks more and tryout Dom Demarco's across town. my wife did order the homemade tiramasu to go and she said it was pretty good. It was 5 dollars. 1 other strange thing even know this is a sit down restaurant it does not have bathrooms??? That was also a pretty serious turn off for us."}
{"text":"This joint is all that and a bag of chips.  Pricier side for its pizza fo sho, but no worries, as many others have stated, one gets what he/she pays for.    These folks are all about NYC thin crust and I'm totally cool with that.  Real deal, gourmet level pizza (without rididiculous toppings like prawns and white truffles).  Expect to spend in the neighborhood of 20 bones (a pricey neighborhood) for a basic large pizza, but the quality of sauce, crust, and toppings are definitely top shelf.  Crispy/chewy crust, dang, these people just plain know how to get the job done! The fresh basil totally kicks it up a notch and is so noticeable that you'll say something out loud about it.  Overall, my wallet wouldn't be able to handle me eating here as often as I'd like,  yet I wouldn't mind developing a little credit card debt if I could have their pizza more often.  It's seriously that good.  Customer service was just fine, no complaints whatsoever.  Full bar, lots of other dishes too...but I don't go to a top shelf pizza joint to drink or to eat a frickin' salad.  I go for the pizza, as you should too.  If you haven't been, put it on your bucket list and then make your own dreams come true."}
{"text":"Honestly? I'm just done with this Grimaldi's. The service absolutely SUCKS and last night's effort was definitely a perfect example of what's wrong with this location.  We had a 1 hour wait last evening, which was excessive given there were tables that were empty waiting to be filled for quite some time. Secondly, we ordered 2 salads but only received 1 of them. We waited so long for the other, the pizza came out first so we cancelled the other salad. No apology. No offer of making it up to us...nothing. There were at least 1/2 a dozen times when a server or a guest broke a dish or glass while we were there. It was almost to the point where people should have started shouting OPAH! afterwards! At one point during our meal, a child raised a plate over his head, smashed a plate to the floor (to which the parents did NOTHING--but that's another story) right in front of the server. The plate broke in a thousand pieces, several of which hit us in the legs. It took at least 15 minutes before someone came and swept up the remnants of the broken plate. That is unacceptable but......Did the manager come over? Heck no. He didn't even MOVE or turn around from his seat at the bar where he was parked watching the Spurs/Heat game. That's right. The manager parked his butt in a seat at the bar the entire time. He would randomly get up and go cut a pizza from time to time, without washing his hands first mind you, but he never came around to a single table, never looked up once during the parade of broken dishes, and could not have been any less involved in his shift. The pizza took so long to arrive that it was actually cold and the crust was soggy.   Done. There's just no reason for this when Grimaldi's isn't a cheap visit at all. I've given too many chances and it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"I've passed by Grimaldi's Pizzeria almost day in an day out and ever realized I was passing a fabulous Pizzeria!  Good friend, Yvonne, mentioned that we should consider dinner after our group run so that she could use her Birthday discount. To be honest, I wasn't really in the mood at that moment for Pizza but rather Chicken Wings.  We arrive to the Pizzeria and upon viewing the menu, I realized that there are no WIngs on the Menu. Yep, I was bummed. We ordered a Pizza and Salad. Ok, the small salad was enough for the both of us. Then out HUGE PIZZA arrived. Oh my... for someone that wasn't in the mood for pizza, I shure ate and ate and ate! After this experience, I completely get it. Grimaldi's is all about the Pizza experience.   Another great restaurant to add to my Collection of Fave spots!  Cheers***"}
{"text":"As always the pizza is great but the service sucks to the max.   They obviously don't train there waiters well.  Had to wait 40 freaking minutes for our pizza.  Almost got up and left."}
{"text":"Excellent from top to bottom!  Not THE best pizza I've ever eaten (That honor goes to Pitch Pizzeria in Omaha) but solid all around. Our service was awesome, the place was clean and decorated nicely, and the price was acceptable, especially considering where this restaurant was (Fashion Show mall). We had a pair of draft beers and a pepperoni & mushroom pizza that was fired perfectly, appropriately topped and sliced at the right temperature.  Good job Grimaldi's!!"}
{"text":"This pizza is seriously addicting. Eat it warm, cold, dine in, take out whatever you desire any way you slice it this pizza is hands down the best in the Vegas Area. My only complaint they don't have delicious bread sticks or really ANY bread sticks to compliment my addiction. BOO HOO BUT I STILL LOVE YOU."}
{"text":"Good Pizza and good service. The pizzas is thin and delicious! The crust was a little tough but perfect if you are a dipper. They have a full bar and awesome beer on tap. If you're going for your birthday sign up with their \"club\" prior to going! They offer a free large pizza for your birthday :)   Ok so as much as I liked the pizza there were a few cons... It was a little loud to hold a conversation. My girlfriends and I were at a 4 person table and we had a hard time hearing the other person if they weren't directly facing them. I brought my 3 yr old daughter along; there was no kids menu offered. No big deal since she could just share but they didn't have that many kid frendly toppings (my daughter wanted ham and pineapple). The pizza is priced with a base price ($12-$18) and then you're charged for every topping you put on ($2-$4). This made it pretty expensive if you like your pizza loaded. There menu is VERY limited. Just a list of pizza base size with a list of toppings, calzones but still have to choose all your toppings, and a few salads. Also, it took a long time for our one pizza to come out (maybe because it was a Saturday night?).    Good pizza... not the best I've ever had... not sure its worth the price."}
{"text":"I wanted to update my Grimaldi's review from earlier tonight.  I went back in around 8pm to check on my pizza to go. The Manager, Kevin Lozano brought it up to me himself.  I asked him where or who I should pay and he said there was no charge and hoped it made up for the trouble.  I took him up on that...he redeemed himself graciously.   BTW, the pizza was a Tax Day Special offer, 16\" for $10.40...and it was delicious. Grimaldi's makes a great pizza."}
{"text":"OMG!  Went here on a quiet Sunday afternoon @ 1:15 with our two young families (12 people total) and could not get a seat.  We were told 30+ minute wait.  It's like the hostess didn't want us there?   The Bar was 20% full, dining area was less less than 50% full and only one of six tables were taken outside.  We told them we could split up in any combination of seats but to no avail.  Never in my life have I been turned down a seat at a pizza restaurant!!!  Bummer, but we ended up across the street at a Capriotti's Sandwich Shop where we were greeted by smiles & plenty of seats - and the food was great!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place is worth visiting. The food was quite delectable and the service, in my opinion, was the best service we have EVER recieved in Vegas. It was genuine, not forced. Big difference. We had the pleasure of meeting the GM Mr. Mike Waters and our server Javier, who had been there since opening, was just unbelievably awesome! I forgot to snap a photo of the Quatroformagi Pizza and Oreo cheesecake, but take my word for it, phenomenal! They also make their own cheesecake in the restaraunt! Good place to dine with family and friends. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza and Prosecco is one of my new favorite combos.  We came here late Tuesday night for some pies after just stumbling upon it while walking around the Palazzo.   Our server, Victor, was very helpful in suggesting a pie for us. Sausage, pepperoni, onions, green peppers, fresh basil leaves, and jalapeños (just on her half). Nothing out of the ordinary. Just good ole fashioned pizza toppings.  The pie itself was great! Came out piping hot and it was very large, and I believe we ordered a small. We wound up boxing a few pieces that we couldn't eat, and helping out a man on the street. Karma.  Grimaldi's. Solving the world's hunger problem one slice at a time."}
{"text":"Meh. Seemed pretty overrated to me. I had a personal pizza with Italian sausage. It was OK for the price, great value for Las Vegas and the palazzo, but didn't really think it was that incredible. The desert sampler trio is a MUST."}
{"text":"Best experience EVER! This was my first time eating Grimaldi's pizza. I was sitting at the bar drinking a beer waiting for my to go order; Ray the bartender did a wonderful job taking care of me. The \"man in charge\" of all Nevada restaurants asked me how I was doing while I was waiting for my pizza. I explained that this was my first time and he insisted that I have my first slice right from the oven and offered to make me an additional pizza (free of charge) while I finished my beer. He then offered me a slice of blueberry cheesecake. I walked out of that place feeling on top of the world! The pizza was delicious; the cheese has such an amazing flavor and the cheesecake; unspeakable! It is very rare that people go above and beyond to make their customers happy! Thank you! I WILL be back :)"}
{"text":"One sentence the BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS  every time we stay in Vegas we come to this place highly recommended"}
{"text":"New york slice of heaven in vegas.  great pizzas with a thin crispy chewy crust. menu is simple-pick your sauce and toppings.  red, white, no sauce...meat toppings, vege toppings, or both..they are cool with splitting toppings between a pizza.  got a pizza with half meatballs and roasted red peppers and half artichokes and mushroom.  food was delicious.  hostess at the initial greeting was rude.  she looked at us with an unfriendly stare that made me wonder why I had come in to eat......"}
{"text":"Let me say first that I am not sure if I would come back again although I might try something different if I do. Kinda torn on the whole experience.   I stopped in for lunch with a friend on a Monday afternoon and waited a few minutes for a host or hostess. The young man who sat me was extremely nice and chatted while he brought me a wine glass.  When my friend got here she said she had been here a few times before and really liked the pizza. My server also the bartender named Daniel was very nice and explained the menu to me. We ordered 2 salads and a small pizza. A server brought out my salad first and when I asked where the other salad was she said its coming, I said I would wait and she asked if she should take it back till the other  salad was ready. I said No and waited for the other salad not very long but could not figure out why she did not bring both out. I had the Caesar and did not enjoy it. First it came in a bowl that reminded me of a cereal bowl and not very flavorful.. I even asked for more dressing and still seem blah.  The pizza which I had heard is awesome was not. First you order the size and crust style then the toppings which cost 2 to 3 dollars apiece. The crust which was thin which I like was chewy.  Overall with 1 glass of wine, a half carfare of wine, pizza and 2 salads the bill was $60.00. I will say the service was above average and the manager a nice lady came by to check on us, made the service experience good."}
{"text":"I came in here and for a couple of beers and shared a small  1/2 pepperoni and  1/2 prosciutto pizza about 2:30 on a Monday.  The pizza was good, the crust and cheese were great.  The prosciutto and pepperoni toppings were average.  Considering it was slow, my pizza was kind of lukewarm.  The service was great.  Overall I prefer local pizza restaurants over chains like Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"My father in law took us out to eat here on a Saturday night around 7pm and it was really packed-we had a 30 minute wait. The ambience and set up of this place is really nice with a casual setting. After being seated our waitress came right out and took our order. The have a large wine selection on the back of their menu and a few beers. I thought it was weird that they didn't have bread sticks or cheese bread or any other appetizers  to order besides salads and calzones.  We ordered the house salad large which was more than enough for four of us. The pizza came out next and it was really greasy but tasted pretty good. The ingredients on the pizza tasted fresh. The large pizza was enough for four of us to have two slices. My daughter and I were also a little disappointed because they didn't carry ranch dressing. This place was pretty good, not the best--but pretty good."}
{"text":"All around the best pizzeria in Las Vegas, I think. Loved their NY style thin crust pizza-- sausage and pepperoni and a margherita.  Great attentive service from kind accommodating staff.  So thankful that they still let 6 of  us dine in 5 mins before closing.  Definitely making this place a must visit when we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"We usually visit the location at Scottsdale Quarter but decided to try this location since it is closer to my home. I was disappointed & will return to the other location next time. Arrived and was told the only table available was a high top table in the bar even though there was approx 8 other empty tables. Waitress was too busy working the bar to give us the necessary time. We waited a long time just for drinks. The soda was flat. Our salads took a very long time to be brought out. My salad was missing the croutons. I had only taken two bites of my salad when our pizza was delivered. Unfortunately by time we finished our salads our pizza was no longer hot. Never offered us drink refills. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"What great pizza. As a fan of the thin crust, I'm in heaven here.   The two gimmicks that make it work are the 1200 degree coal-fired oven and the softened, filtered water that's used to make the dough.   On my last trip, there were four of us for a busy dinner time at 5:00 on a Sunday. We shared two pizzas, one with pepperoni, the other with olives. Both were stellar, as was the antipasto appetizer and the house red wine. The service was adequate, as every table was full and there was a wait at the door."}
{"text":"Did not think I liked thin crust pizza but a friend of mine wanted to to go there so I went.  It was the Friday after Christmas and the place was packed they had booked a couple of parties that night and there was a 90 minute wait if you did not have reservations.  Despite making reservation the rude young man at the front door told us we would still have to wait 90 minutes and there was nothing he could do and turned away.  Once we talked to the manager she said she would do what she could and we had a table about a half hour latter.  I liked the pizza more then I thought I would and that is good given the high price they charge for it.  Despite that we did have a good time and once my job situation gets more secure so it is not so painful overpaying for pizza I do plan on going back for some really good overpriced pizza.  Hopefully the young man at the door will go work for a bail bonding, a repo company or some other occupation he is better suited for."}
{"text":"Take me to new york and ill show you good pizza, or just enioy warm winters at this gilbert location. Erron the bartender nailed great service. Smart, helpful, and not to bad on the eyes. Excellent recommendation of the \"Don\". Lovely atmosphere.  Keep up the good work, you're crushing it!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ so far!! Our server Jason was amazing so friendly and nice! Great food  amazing service great prices ! My boyfriend is a true New Yorker and loved the food"}
{"text":"We have eaten at Grimaldi's in Florida, but never here.  The restaurant was crowed but we were seated right away. Our waiter Anthony was at our table within 3-4 minutes getting our drink order. He was really nice, explained the menu and answered our questions. What I always look for besides great food is great service.  Isn't that what you pay for?  Anthony took our order and our pizzas were in front of us in less than 20 minutes. Hot and perfect. I am spoiled when it comes to Pizza because I grew up outside of NYC and know what I like.  I like Grimaldi's  it may be a chain, but the food is really  good and the service at this location was wonderful."}
{"text":"One of the better pizza places in town.  Sometimes you will get attitude but I am okay with that for good food.  Recently I have been ordering to go, which is nice in the summer as they will bring it out to your car.  The salads here are not too bad either.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Don't bring kids here...this a family restaurant that doesn't want kids.  Staff is disrespectful to kids and families with small kids.  Decent product poor staff and management.  In fact unless you are perfect like the staff don't go here.  Did I mention that being insulted by staff members is encouraged here?"}
{"text":"We had a great server named Brady. The management is all nice. The food is great. We got the Grimaldis House Salad and Caprese which were both great. For our main course we got the white pizza with garlic that was superb. The calzone is also a must try. The desert is great too. We got the tiramisu and cannoli which is a great thing to get after an awesome pizza."}
{"text":"We went there for a late lunch today.  There were a lot of wait staff, but only two 20 something customers.  The menu is pretty much pizza and salads.  My husband was the one craving pizza, so I let him order a sausage, mushroom, and onion regular 16\" pie.  The pizza is New York style; thin, chewy crust.  There was a nicely spicy sausage, a real stringy cheese and fresh mushrooms and onions.  Then why didn't I like it?  It's the crust, Mr. Pizza Man!  Yes, they were spinning and twirling it.  Yes, it had pockets of char.  But overall it had NO flavor.  The pizza at Settebello is so much better there is no contest.    The service started strong with quick drinks and refills, but ended on a bad note.  We not only got the wrong bill (nope, we did not have salad and Tirimisu.  The only other customers in the house did.), but to add insult to injury we practically had to stand on our chairs and shout to get it fixed because all the staff was flirting with the 20 somethings.  Would we come back?  Nope."}
{"text":"Dear Grimaldi's,  I love you. My tummy loves you. My taste buds love you. My soul loves you.   Friends from Texas were visiting and they said you are suppose to be good...they had heard from co-workers and friends that you are the place to go when in the area. With this advice we give it a try their first night in town...and then again their third night in town.   I have never in my life had wine perfectly paired with pizza and with all of your flavors and goodness I crave you all the time. I can't wait to come back. The wait to get a table is average compared to neighboring restaurants and just really I can't wait to come back. I love you, and your pizza and your desert (THE SAMOA CHEESECAKE!!!!).   With love and affection,  Leah"}
{"text":"Tourist trap in downtown Scottsdale.  Beau and I were in for an awesome pizza experience.  What we actually got was:   1. An antipasto that competed only with Costco tasters.  Haven't seen an antipasto so sparse  - with a few red peppers from the jar - in the Phoenix area.   2. A server so lazy that apparently didn't wish to  recall the beers available - hey, just read the menu.    3. Calzone was full of ricotta and cheese.  Nope, no flavor.   4. Garlic pizza was okay."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the very best thin crust pizza I've ever had. We shared a pie with meatballs(an undeniable must topping here) pepperoni and roasted red peppers. The sauce to crust ratio is just perfect as is the crunchiness of the crust as well. Just flawless. The Caesar salad wasn't a bad way to start off either. Just go. Now."}
{"text":"All I could say is that this place is overly hyped up.  *Whew!* I finally got THAT off my chest! Feels great! Oh yeah!!   So..to start this off, the \"service\" was not great! Coming from a 5-star hotel, you would expect better service. Am I right? Or am I right? Yes, I am right.   The waitress - I forgot what her name was because her \"service\" sucked balls - was not helpful at all and was very rude.  When we first arrived, she never greeted us and was trying to rush us into ordering. Dude! We're not at Pho Kim Long, were at The Palazzo!   Anyways, to start our dinner off, I wanted to order a glass of Sangria and asked our waitress what her recommendation was since I had a choice of a white or red Sangria. She answered me with, \"Well, that depends on what you like. If you like a sweet or sour.\" Ummmm, Chinese food sweet and sour?! Say what? Who? How? Where? When? That...was...helpful?! I guess! I blankly stared at her for a second and kept quiet. It was such an awkward moment, I HAD to just brush it off. You would think that she would at least make up some BS just to show that she was trying to help me but no, she did not. I ended up getting the white Sangria - just because the menu says that it has Moscato in it. Thanks to the menu, it was more helpful than our waitress! High 5!   As far as the pizza goes, who in their right minds would think that this place serves \"AMAZING\" pizza? Man, it was far from amazing I'll tell you that! Sometimes, I wonder if the waitress was the one who made the pizza because that pizza was just as bad as her service.   Reasons why I did not like the pizza:  Strike 1: The pizza came out warm...almost cold. Strike 2: The inner part of the pizza was soggy and VERY watery. Strike 3: The pizza sauce was acidic! It was worse that Ragu. Lmao!   Oh and to top off the horrible dinner experience, my 12-year-old nephew ordered a personal pizza and it came out last - after everyone had already eaten! WHY? Because apparently, when his pizza went into the brick oven, it flopped over. Lol!"}
{"text":"I was impressed that this pizza still tasted just like the original! We had the white pizza (add onions, mushrooms, and ricotta) and The Don. Both were excellent but if I had to choose one, I'd get The Don. The meatballs were so good!! I also had a delicious aperol spritz and my husband really enjoyed his blueberry lemonade. Service was great."}
{"text":"Meh. That's what I've got for this one.  Why the hell is there a 2 hour wait for this place? It's not bad, but it's certainly not amazing. They have tiny menu -- pizza, calzones, a app salad, and antipasto. That's it. Period. Done.    So therefore, their customer service and food should be out of this world. They're not.  I got there \"early\" for Scottsdale, and was given a buzzer and a 30-45 minute wait, so I sat down out front to wait for the rest of my party.  My friends arrived. And we waited and waited. I went to check at 35 minutes, and we were next on the list.  Finally, at an hour, I went back inside to check. \"Oh, we buzzed you twice, you didn't answer.\" Um, no. I purposely didn't wander somewhere more comfy and away for douchey guys with their collars popped so that I could be near the door. And if someone doesn't answer their buzzer, how about stepping the 2 feet out the door and calling their name, so maybe at the least, you could get your pizza shaped buzzer back.  It didn't really get better from there. We finally got sat. It took forever to order, and longer to get our food. Not to mention that all three of our glasses (sprite, iced tea and water) stood empty for literally 25 minutes (I timed it). Calzones came and they were ok, but certainly nothing to write home about.  From being seated to getting out of there, it was about 1 hour, 45 minutes. That's how slow the service was.  I'm giving 3 stars, because I have since heard that their pizza is their thing, and I'm willing to wait and see on that."}
{"text":"Stopped In tonight after work to order a pizza for the family and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the staff were. They opened the door and greeted me before I could extend my arm. The entrance was most interesting, they made the Grimaldi's name out of cork parts and even a small basket from them.   I ventured to the end of the bar area to place my to go order and was met by more pleasant employees. I placed my order and posted up at the bar. I perused the bar drink menu and decided to partake of a glass of vino while waiting. I soon finished the glass and started on my water. The pizza arrived and I finished my water. I closed out the tab and thank them in advance for hey opened the door when the saw me coming.  Very nice employees and some of the best brick oven pizza in Las Vegas. I will be back again and again :-)"}
{"text":"You know I have to leave this Grimaldi's review as my first in over 6 years... For many years many of you knew that I was the \"Face of Grimaldi's\" on Yelp. My photo was the first one that came up on this listing, and it was my finest achievement.  Grimaldi's is the best pizza spot in town. Here is the order. (thanks, Mark Hummel) Large, Extra sauce, Pepperoni, and Ricotta.   Done.   They also have a good beer selection and an open kitchen so you can see the pizza's coming out!   Definitely one of my favorite date spots with Cara Rose;)"}
{"text":"READ THIS REVIEW:  Based off the reviews here on yelp, Grimaldi's Is terrible. The pizzeria itself doesn't look bad, but the service and pizza are sub par. I think there were about 5 tables in the entire restaurant, and yet it took 40 minutes for us to receive our food. I got the traditional with Italian sausage and onions. The sausage tasted like sausage from pizza hut. Good pizza should not fall apart when i'm eating it. Overall, the pizza was just bland with nothing exciting about it. At the end, the server charged me 5 dollars more than our total bill, and when I asked her about it, she said she didn't remember and just handed me 5 dollars from someone else's check. Very unprofessional. I was in vegas looking for a good place to eat and this place received 4.5 stars. Why. There is nothing 4 stars about this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful hand tossed thin crust with fresh ingredients, baked in a brick oven. What else can you ask for? Ah yes, you can watch them being made from your table. It tastes excellent and served piping hot. Highly recommend you get there before you're hungry because there will be a wait to be seated. Don't let that stop you, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"WHERE: Eastern & Richmar (inside the plaza, right by Cafe Rio)  WHY: If you're craving legit New York style pizza, this is the place to be!  WHAT: I never thought for once that I would be able to taste the difference between pizzas until I came here.  For years, I've always thought that pizza was just pizza! Little did I know, pizza here is beyond Little Caesar's!  I am a part of a charity, and we actually held a charity event here a few months ago, and it was the first time I've ever stepped foot into this place. I mean, I've seen it around, but never got to trying it.  Let me tell you! The entire staff including the manager were all wonderful, accommodating, and super friendly!  They had plenty of recommendations (Everthing was basically recommended, and I'm going to have to agree!)  Note: It is all thin-crust goodness! From the classic sauce, to the white sauce, all the way to the pesto sauce-- all G double O D = GOOD! There is also a list of toppings you may choose from (tomatoes, mushroom, SUN DRIED TOMATOES, anchovies, and the list goes on), and also different sizes of pizza. I'd recommend the biggest one (you know, so you can save the rest for later. You gotta strategize!!). So about the pizza, I'll leave it at that. Now it's your turn to try it!  Now onto the desserts! I am not a huge fan of cheesecake, but I'll definitely eat a slice here! There is a variety to choose from as well (RECURRING THEME: so many to choose from, all so GOOD)! I have personally tried the oreo cheesecake (I highly recommend), original NY style, and the pumpkin cheesecake... which were all just perfection melting in my mouth! Yes, melt it does. The consistency of the cheesecake is just so perfect, probably why I'll only like cheesecake here at Grimaldi's!! Aside from the cheesecake, you must try the cannoli!!! JUST DO IT!  FUN FACT: Grimaldi's has a unique water system, where their water comes directly from NY, to get that authentic NY style pizza. DID I GET YOU NOW??...  I HOPE SO... GO NOW! THERE ARE SEVERAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE CITY =D"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY life to date.  To put this into perspective, this is the ONLY Yelp review I have EVER put the effort to write even though I've I've swore I would a dozen times.   Here's the story (grab some popcorn): I put in a simple pizza order to go. Said they weren't busy and it would be ready in 20-25 minutes. I show up almost 35 minutes late, pizza isn't done, no big deal right? Who cares? Wait a few more minutes, this is no issue. They tell me I can find a seat in the bar while I wait. So a server comes out to give me the bill 5 or so minutes later. He comes back for it I tell him to keep the change (generous tip, especially for a to-go order). So I've been here at this point 15 minutes which is 25 minutes longer than the max wait time. Still no issue to me. I'm patient. The server comes to me and apologies and tells me the order was never put in some how. Now believe it or not we still don't have an issue. Idc, I'm very chill and laid back. About another 10-15 minutes go by still no pizza. Guy comes by and again and apologizes, says he doesn't know what's taking so long. Come to find out they forgot to put it in the second time around.  At this point I'm dumb founded but still patient. Not a peep out of me. I figure it will be done NOW in 10-15 minutes. Maybe 20 max! (if you know anything about the service industry, when an order is put in late it's generally put into the front of the line or in this case if something is almost done and the same they will take that one. To give to the person waiting and hurry up the one coming in late). So once my order was late, forgot to put in twice, it still wasn't rushed.  It took another 20-30 minutes to make the pizza.   So let's add this up here: 35 min to get to the pizza,  15 min to wait and take care off the bill and drink a water, 15 minutes for the second wait time to put the pizza in again. Then 20-30 minutes for the pizza to get made. Thats adds up to 85 to 95 minutes for a 20 minute pizza.   Now here is where it got frustrating. FIRST, the server took my money before my pizza was wed brought to me much less even made. I was just going to literally leave about 3 times but remembered I was trapt cause he already took my money. Secondly, during what had to been their worst moment of service ever a manager never came and spoke to me which is a MUST! Even at the crappiest restaurant in the world a manager will come solve the problem.   Then lastly where it become a complete laughable joke was my order was never comped, or discounted, or any freebies offered to make the experience. But the guy offered me a free soda   Save to say I WILL NEVER dine here again and will not only NEVER suggest it I will activity convince people not to go here if asked.   I hope this horrible experience for me had guided you away from wasting your time here and provided you some entertainment in reading.    Oh, and the most important part, the pizza was mediocre at best!"}
{"text":"Its good pizza. My kids love their anchovy pizzas. Their pizzas are great becuase of the dough, their ovens and equally the sauce. Anyway you order it, it'll be good."}
{"text":"My work brought in this pizza and it was my first time ever having it and it was really good! I live so close but I've never went in always wanted to! But the crust was probably one of the best things about the pizza ! I only ate the cheese and pepperoni but it was better than most pizzas I've had at other places ! I'll be back to try something new!"}
{"text":"Thin crust, cheesy, finger licking goodness! Great family atmosphere friendly service our Sunday spot for fam bam day! My kids love this place I love this place and its inexpensive"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find a pizzeria that would compare to our Brooklyn Taste profile while on VACA in Arizona. Long story short, pizza Friday is pizza Friday no matter where you are so when we went away we needed to find a pizzeria that could contend with our New York expectations.  We chose grimaldis. Happy we did. Pizza was better than expected... But hey.... Not like Brooklyn but just enough to pass. How u doin' fuhgeddaboudit...."}
{"text":"When I eat pizza in non-east coast cities now, one of the first questions I ask myself is \"would I eat this at home?\" The answer with Patsy Grimaldi's is definitely an affirmative.  You: \"But isn't their pizza just like the Grimaldi's 2 blocks from your house?\"  Patsy Grimaldi's in Scottsdale doesn't have the fluffly, chewy crust of its brethren in the NYC area. Instead, the crust is crispier a la Frank Pepe's of New Haven. Of course, I loved Frank Pepe, so that's certainly not a criticism. Just don't go expecting fluffy, chewy crust!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, and the atmostphere is open and they have outside dining.  We enjoy chilling at the bar with the friendly bartender Anthony, you can people watch and relax."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time after living here over a year and my only regret is that I never went  until now!  Amazing pizza!  Love all the options you have from the sauce to the toppings.  The atmosphere was very alive but not crazy loud.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining the menu, options and making suggestions.  Just wish they did delivery!  Definitely a place that I will go to on a regular basis.  Great beer and beverage selection also.  This is how pizza should be!"}
{"text":"I am such a huge fan of Grimaldi's! You know a pizza is amazing when you can do without any toppings and regular ole cheese tastes fantastic. The coal oven creates a lovely crisp crust and perfect melt to the cheese. The antipasto plate is delicious too! If you register for email updates on their website, they will send you an email for a FREE PIZZA for your birthday, up to $18 - well worth it! I love you Grimaldi's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food and the service! Sarah specifically made the experience amazing! Will come again very soon and spread the word as well!"}
{"text":"The manager wrote to me personally regarding my previous review and directly addressed the issues with our visit. I'm impressed by his polite and honest reply and will give them another try soon."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Try the personal cheese pizza topped with ricotta!  Amazing creamy deliciousness!  Also tiramisu is to die for!   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed.  When your primary product is pizza and your menu is fairly limited you need to work hard to set yourself apart the crowd.  Unfortunately for me, Grimaldis fell flat on its face from an experience standpoint.  While my previous experiences have been average my latest encounter left me regretting my choice.  This evening I ordered a pizza to-go which you would think would be a simple uneventful task.  Not so.  My son and I stood waiting for 5 minutes before someone even offered to help us without any other customers waiting ahead of us.  Then we watched as the manager proceeded to pull each of the two girls who were handling take out orders away from their job to discuss some errors that had apparently occurred during their shift.  Mind you, this is in the midst of a Sunday night take out rush.  After the second girl got her \"talking to\" I watched as she tried to compose herself (unsuccessfully) and then proceeded to remove her apron and walk out the door.  That left one poor girl to tend the phones and handle the to-go traffic since the Manager conveniently decided to disappear to the back of the house after her \"talks\" with the to-go staff.  The remaining girl jumped between calls while to-go orders piled up below her counter.  I had a sneaking suspicion that one of those pizzas was mine, since I had now been waiting over 25 minutes, but I had no chance to ask about it because nobody was around to ask and the one counter girl was jumping from call to call.  After waiting another 15-20 minutes the girl started checking the pizzas and, just as I had assumed, brought me mine from the pile.  When I told her that I knew that this pizza had already been sitting there for 20 minutes she apologized and offered the lame excuse that it was very busy tonight.    I have at least 5-10 other pizza places I pass on my way to this place and Grimaldis just gave me an excuse to either try the others again or give them a first try before I return to this place."}
{"text":"Having grown up in NYC my needs/expectations for pizza are simple: a thin, crunchy, but not cracker-like bottom crust; an edge crust that has some crack to it when you bite into it but not dry and high quality balanced toppings that share the stage with their counterparts.  Bring on the Grimaldis Margarita pizza!  They nailed it!  The slightly sweet Marinara sauce, thin sliced fresh mozzarella rounds and fresh basil leaves are the trio of flavors that define this pie.    For those hailing from the Big Apple folding a slice is the only way you can walk and eat in the subway or as you rush to your next destination. When folded the end should not sag and drop its toppings if you're consuming a \"plain pie\".  It's survival 101.  Try it on your slice at Grimaldis...it passed the test.  My recent trip to Vegas was the second time I've been to this establishment.  It was on my punch-list since my last trip 2 years earlier.  My BW another couple and I shared a large freshly prepared house salad (easily enough for 4-6 hungry eaters), some draft brews and the large Margarita pie made up our dinner out.  Service was efficient and fast (perhaps too fast since we were still passing the salad bowl around when the pie came).  The dining space was a little noisier than I like but, when the pizza arrived, no one needed to talk.  The pizza disappeared rapidly and I easily could have taken down another slice without much encouragement.  A TOTALLY enjoyable dinner for 4 under $50 is hard to come by in Vegas.   Oh yes, before we left Sin City a week later we went back for a 2nd time.  That's something to say in a town filled with wall to wall restaurants!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's makes a great pie, sadly they don't make their staff anywhere near as good. First off the hosts were a disaster, I came to ask if I could put my name down and received a blank stare. Later on I asked for a perfect Manhattan. The bartender asked me what I wanted it made with, SoCo, Bourbon, Canadian...What? I am thinking to myself. I told him I would have Bourbon, followed by instructing him on what the implication of the prefix perfect in my drink meant (thats half sweet and half dry Vermouth). As I was starting to tell him the meaning of perfect he told me he knew what it was. Eventually he made and served my drink, on the rocks which I had not specified. My mom and I split a greek salad, which was well sized considering it was not the large size. It needed more olives and feta and especially more red onion. My mom and I asked if we could split a pizza without a fee for splitting the pie. The bartender said it would be no problem, but when he brought the bill he charged us. I will NOT be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good place to rest and talk after a long day in Vegas.  In a quiet corner of the Venetian.  Pizza crust is a nice mix between thin and flavorful - good texture.  Get the meatball topping.  Excellent cannoli.  Well executed but it's not a \"must see\" place either."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Old Town. Love the white pizza. We always get anchovies and pesto as extra toppings. Late afternoon arrival avoids a wait for a table.  Love the atmosphere and the Rat Pack music."}
{"text":"I'm still not sure how we walked out of this place paying over $70 for one pizza, a small salad and 2 drinks. We could have had a much better dinner at North or Flemings for the same amount. The pizza was good, not great... would have been great if it had more flavor. Be aware, this is not a \"nice\" place, And way too expensive for what you get. We will not be going back!"}
{"text":"It's pie day and where do the classy ones go for a Flavorful Wonderful pizza...Yes good ol Grimaldi's babe..Taste is so explosive and I'm sitting outside enjoying Wine on Pie day..don't get much better then this... awwww thank you Lindsay Best service ever..."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza salad and an Italian experience. The service and food was excellent"}
{"text":"Been here once, and I'm already a big fan.  Some of the best pizza I've had.  We had the monthly special - rosemary potato white pizza with gorgonzola cheese.  It was SO good.  We also ordered a cheese pizza for the kids, which was less good, but tasted great cold the next morning.  They bring out dough balls for the kids to play with pre-eating, so it kept everyone busy and quiet (for a change.)  Will definitely be back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"There pizza was good but their calzone was amazing. If it's a busy weekend I suggest calling in to make a reservation.   We got a large pizza and large calzone and it was enough for 6 people. Very filling and I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Fairly good food. Pepperoni does well since it is smaller but thicker.  Got the calzone custom made. More importantly the martini was  the hit I'm drink here. I usually like to go for the margarita. It was small and weak..eh...but the martini was the typical size but strong as well as tasty. Bar tender was decent but needed some more personality as a \"bar tender\" but overall a decent place to visit. Certainly will consider it for future visits when in the pizza mood."}
{"text":"11/12/2012  I had the pepperoni, Italian sausage, jalapeno and basil. GREAT pizza! One of the best I've ever had anywhere."}
{"text":"There's not much good pizza in Vegas. But grimaldis is awesome. I'm from the Philadelphia area and can attest that it's great!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Without a doubt the best pizza I have ever had and I would go again.   However, be aware - Bring a big wallet.  3 drinks, 2 pizzas with salad = $91.00 plus tip, so bottom line was - $100.  Like I said, I will go again, but not very often."}
{"text":"I love grimaldis but this location was a disappointment. Husband and i went in afternoon for lunch and the service was awful.  There was 4 others in the restaurant and it took 10 minutes to get our ice tea & water. Waiter says he forgot about us huddled over in the corner (we were seated at the table next to the pizza makers). I find this hard to believe considering the bar where he was stationed on looked to where we were sitting but was was too busy chatting with the couple at the bar.   Then we never got the salad that we ordered that he claim we never said but he repeated the order back to us, so we just cancelled it because why would i want my salad after our pizza??  Only reason I'm giving this a 2 star is because whoever made our spinach pizza did a damn good job. Thank you   Overall won't  be coming back to this grimaldis. The service at the Boca park  location is amazing and they are always checking on their patrons to make sure everything is going well."}
{"text":"When I want a really good pizza this is the place I go and being from new york, i'm pretty picky when it comes to my pizzas. My husband and I usually get the spinach pizza and its amazing, always cooked perfectly. The Caesars salad dressing has just the right amount of flavors without one or the other being too overpowering. I've been to some places where the dressing tasted like too much garlic or anchovie.   When you sign up for their mailing list, you get a free large pizza around your birthday as long as you dine in which is awesome.  Every fall they have a caramel apple cheesecake that is the bomb! I am not a big fan of cheesecake but theirs is fluffy and flavorful.   The place is usually busy which isn't bad because the noise doesn't seem to echo likes it does in some restaurants and I really like the decor."}
{"text":"Heard about this place on Instagram and had to try it out. We were seated right away and the waitress took our order in a reasonable amount of time. Waitress explained the menu which was very simple, Pizza, salads, beer and wine. We ordered 2 pizzas, one with white sauce and the other with red sauce (Don). Thin crust was amazing as was the antipasto appetizer. Just know this is not your typical antipasto that usually comes with lettuce. No, this has no salad just meat, cheese, and sweet red peppers. Very delicious and the ambience made the entire meal even more enjoyable. Friendly staff, great service, and quality food for a fair price. We will definitely be looking at this place the next time we are in El Segundo which is closer to where we live."}
{"text":"Free Pizza!  Can't beat that.  If you sign up for their e-club they send you a coupon for a free large one topping pizza.  I usually wait to long and it expires but this year I was determined to use it.  We went today, it wasn't to busy and we were seated right away.  We ordered the white pizza half with sausage and mushrooms (since so many yelp reviews recommended this).  While we were waiting out server brought my son some pizza dough to play with while we wait.  That was nice since sometimes the pizza can take awhile.  The pizza was very good.  I preferred the plain white to the white with sausage and mushrooms.  I still think Secret Pizza's white pizza is better but this is a good off strip option.  I am not a huge fan of thin crust anywhere and here it is a little to crispy for me.  Overall it was still a good pie, especially in Las Vegas where good pizza is hard to find."}
{"text":"Coming from Brooklyn, I was happy to see a Grimaldis! We ordered the white pizza and a pepperoni and they were both fantastic. We also ordered a variety of bruschetta which were equally as good. The complientary bread is always a plus and they bring out little dough for kids to play with. Service was great even though the restaurant itself was pretty busy."}
{"text":"My mom loves this place. In my opinion, it's ok. The sauce lacks flavor, but other than that, the pizza is decent and the cheesecake is fabulous. I'm removing stars because their add-ons are ridiculous. They sell a personal margarita pizza for $12. If you want to add garlic, it's $2 extra. They also charge $2 for minor things like extra basil. That's just outrageous. Their sauce is sufficiently flavorless that add-ons like garlic and basil become necessary if you want a good pizza."}
{"text":"Here for spring training and wanted casual Italian. Great experience. Sam was our server. Answered our menu questions and gave Just the right amount of attention. She got us drinks and a salad right away. Pizzas were exactly what we expected thin crust with fresh toppings. Finished with chocolate peanut butter cup cheesecake mmmmmm. Will recommend and return."}
{"text":"Ordered two large pizzas to go from Grimaldi's with high hopes that I would be tasting a bit of New York before I make my first visit out there and boy was I disappointed. One of the boys in my group highly recommended it and according to Yelp, it was a highly recommended place to dine, so we decided to make the call. We ordered a large chicken jalepeno (my go-to pizza wherever I go) and a large pepperoni, onion, and mushroom for 6 people. The pizza were thin crust slices, which can be a hit or miss for me. The pepperoni, mushroom, onion pizza was the most flavorful of the two. The chicken on the chicken jalepeno pizza tasted odd and I felt like it didn't belong. The jalepeno added a nice kick to the pizza, but wasn't enough to make me go for a second slice. The cheese on the pizza was different from the normal mozzarella cheese, and looked almost like goat cheese. Everything about my first try at Grimaldi's pizza was a miss for me. Luckily, I had some good company to share in on this painful experience with me. Sadly, I probably won't give this place a second try and neither will I put it on my to-go list when I visit New York."}
{"text":"OK guys my first time here the place looks amazing on the inside my waitress nicole is awesome! So I ordered a Sam Adams cold brew and a large pepperoni bacon pizza so let's see what happens. Let's Go!!!!"}
{"text":"The best thin crust around. We love it. I ordered  over the phone and then picked up. Friendly staff, great service. Under 20 for large pepperoni ."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review. I've been back to this location a few times in the last couple of months. Not sure what they did, but the customer service was way better than before! Pizza was good as usual."}
{"text":"Damn good Pizza!!! Great crust, great toppings and tasty sauce! What more can I ask for? Comin' back here real soon! Yeah!"}
{"text":"Five stars for service, food & atmosphere. This place looked packed from the outside but I gave it a shot as I was in no hurry and dining alone with my Kindle Fire to keep me company. The hostess seated me right away. She asked if I have been here before and when I told her this was my first time. She was excited to highlight the menu to me.   The service was prompt and friendly. Rena made me feel right at home. It's Top off Tuesday (1/2 off wine) I discovered and enjoyed two glasses of Lock & Key Meritage.   I had the small Caesar (which is really a LARGE) and enough to feed two and the Personal Pesto Pizza with Pepperoni for $2.00 extra ($12.00 total) for a personal pizza which can really feed two. But what the hell, I'll fill up on Salad and take the 4 left over big slices of pizza to go.   The thin crust pizza met my approval. If I wasn't so full from Salad and wine, I could have attempted another slice put happy to know I have cold pizza the next day waiting for me. My server Rena did quite a good job selling me on the Chocolate Chessecake that I ordered one to go.   I think I left fat, (almost drunk-but-not- quite) & very happy.  I was left alone to read my Kindle, attended to so I never had to ask...and generally enjoyed my solitude in a very bustling but fun atmosphere. Better than New York City can ever dish out."}
{"text":"heard about it and finally had the time to try it. almost as close as a NY pie, but it's good for me being in LV. I've tried the eastern ave restaurant and i had a great time there. the staff was great and the food was great.  the dipping sauce that came with the calzone did take me back to NY. i  do recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Meatballs are fresh and truly homemade. Price is a little high from other business around  but the pizza won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza to date I can't wait to come back and eat here again! We ordered the Don and added ricotta & basil"}
{"text":"We've been to the original pizzeria in Midtown Manhattan and the taste of the sauce and ingredients is just as good here.  We made a beeline to Grimaldi's here at the Palazzo after checking into our suite at the Venetian next door.  Our server Katey was a kick and awesome.  The Don pizza came out just the way we like it, crispy from the edge to the center, none of that floppy, soggy middle section.  Like our other favorite server Chris, Katey was attentive, personable and really genuine.  I'd gladly give this visit another 5 Stars for excellent pizza and fantastic service.  We came back the following night after the show for another Grimaldi's fix and this time the identical pizza was soggy in the middle and our server Arthur was very forgettable.  When you provide average service at best, don't top it off by leaving the bill and my credit card at the farthest possible spot on the table away from me Art.  I've owned businesses including a restaurant and know that my servers will be the last representative my customers would remember.  For decent, but not spectacular pizza crust and lack of personality from this server, I give this last visit 2 1/2 stars.    Consistency and feeling valued as a customer makes for repeat business in the service and food industry.  There's a Grimaldi's just across the boulevard in the Fashion Mall which I think we'll try next time instead. based on our last visit here at the Palazzo.   I'm sure since we're regulars at the Venetian we'll give this restaurant another shot someday, but it won't be in the evening and we'll be sure to ask for Chris or Katey!"}
{"text":"Had a birthday celebration for the hubs here recently, and they handled our somewhat rowdy party of 16 like pros. Was able to call ahead and reserve space, pre order extra large tiramisu \"cake style\" and had Lainie, the lovely fellow NYer as our server.  The bussers were on point, clearing quickly, keeping water filled, and boxing up extra bread for my carb loving niece.   Everyone enjoyed the appetizers: antipasto platters; caprese plattters, and the Mediterranean and Caesar salads. I preferred the Medi salad. Lainie suggested the Girl and Dragon Pinot Grigio, a quaffer, which was crisp, reasonable at $25/bottle, and part of the proceeds of vineyard goes to charity; we were very charitable ordering four bottles with dinner ;)   The tables ordered The Don, Quattro Formaggio, and a couple of \"make your own\" custom pies. All were served piping hot, and everyone enjoyed their respective pies, and sharing. My favorite is the Quattro. Generous toppings and nice char on crust. The tiramisu is light and tasty.   We've had variations on the above during subsequent visits, and were satisfied with food and service. Scott took the cheesecake to-go on our last visit and absolutely loved it. Great for a date night or large party, we shall return.  * Sign up for their email club, and receive a free pizza (up to $20) for your birthday, or up to two weeks after *  ** they are currently offering a special on Gift Certificates for the holidays (order online) $50 cert gets you a $10 cert; $100 yields $20 cert **   *** Patio seating (overlooks the car park @ Las Palomas strip mall) ***"}
{"text":"Awesome service, this particular Grimaldis is the best in town! Staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and geniuine! Get meatballs on it!!! no matter what you get !!!!"}
{"text":"Beer is nice and cold, pizza is ok, service was good.   Biggest downer is that they don't carry ranch dressing...pretty sad! I don't eat pizza without it. What restaurant doesn't carry ranch????? 2 stars from me."}
{"text":"Went here with family and mother while on vacation in February. Waitstaff was great. Very attentive and entertaining. We sat in the outdoor patio in the \"middle\" of the restaurant. Really nice atmosphere in the middle patio. Not too loud yet good for large groups. We tried the pesto pizza along with the usual pizza. Even the kids loved it."}
{"text":"Great location. Every 15 minutes you can see a Lambo or 'Rari drive by. We had a huge soccer team for lunch. I still felt the service was slow. Once we did order, the pizzas came fast and hot. Really good pizza. I do prefer the old Scottsdale location because of the patios."}
{"text":"So it was race day and that means free macros.  So we went up to Grimaldis at Scottsdale Quarter because my girlfriend had never been to a Grimaldi's  I've only been a few times and a different location each time and always enjoyed the pizza and beer.  We got the Antipasti and The Don.  I also ordered up a Peroni, you can't always find Italian Beers so I definitely went for it.  Our waitress brought our the Antipasti and three minutes later our pizza came out, unsure of if they forgot to submit our order or not because we were having a good time.  However, they re-made the pizza and it came out right when we finished the antipasti so that was solid.  I hope the wait staff got some free pizza out of that.    Solid night out for sure."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, I was immediately hit with the \"we're not in a mall anymore\" feeling with red and white checkered tablecloths, a small bar in the corner, and photos showcasing different areas of New York. The vibe is cozy and laid back and you almost forget that you are in a mall.   The service was exceptional and our server was very friendly and as soon as she found out that I was a Grimaldi's newbie, she gave a helpful breakdown of the menu and gave plenty of time to decide.   As for the food, it is up to you to create your own pizza creation! They have the options of a classic red, personal white with garlic (no sauce but it comes with extra cheese so yay), or pesto as the base. Sizes are: personal, small (16 inch), and large (18 inch). The rest aka toppings? That, my friend, is entirely up to you! You can choose to be a minimalist or go big with whatever toppings you would like. I ended up getting a classic red with Italian sausage, garlic, mushroom, and green peppers. Since it was NY style pizza with a thinner crust, the wait wasn't long at all and before I knew it, my beloved creation came! Even just looking at the pizza, you can tell it was made with a lot of love with a perfect topping ratio. And the taste test: DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza that won't leave you feeling stuffed but still very satisfied. I usually just get a pepperoni, sausage and peppers pizza, and it's always great. Service has always been good as well. Sometimes this place gets VERY busy and the seating is really crowded. If you're lucky you can get a table with a little more room outside. This has been my favorite place for pizza in Scottsdale since I moved here a couple years ago."}
{"text":"Grimaldis is a family favorite. The pizza and calzones are amazing. The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable.  It is more expensive than local delivery chains but the atmosphere makes for a great night out-for families or date night. There is ALWAYS a line but they now take reservations. The only complaint I have is that there is a time in the afternoon that they stoke the coals and you can't get pizza-that information should definitely be on their website."}
{"text":"Fun social atmosphere.  Excellent selection of foods.  Great friendly service.  A memorable experience.  I ate lunch here with friends after our SF Giants Spring Training Game rained out.  Found shelter here, enjoyed a nice Irish Coffee and split a pizza with some friends.  Good times."}
{"text":"I would have left 5 out of 5 stars but I'll get to that a little later.  Some of the best pizza I've had in my lifetime. The meatball and ricotta pizza that we order is so freaking good, my taste buds were giving me a high five after have some of that pie.  The white pizza is simple and has lots of yummy garlic on it, one of my favorites as well.  We also like a little salad with our pizza so we always get the Caesar salad when we come here, we get a large and it easily feeds 4 people. Ask for extra dressing on the side, they don't overly dress the salad.  The reason why I gave it 4 out of 5 is because the service is really bad. In order for anyone to follow up, we have to track down our server. You would think for as busy as this place gets they would staff it better so you actually get service, after all, isn't that the reason you go out to dinner, so you can sit and relax and have others serve you?"}
{"text":"Dined here with my husband during a birthday trip to Las Vegas and was not disappointed. We didn't have to wait to be seated, and our waitress was very friendly and attentive. We loved the neat atmosphere of this place, from the checkered tablecloths to the unique bottle lighting and brick walls-definitely a fun but yet relaxing kind of vibe. The pizza tasted great-flavorful and with just the right amount of toppings. Since we dined here on my birthday, we used the birthday coupon they emailed me (after joining their club), which made for a nice, small bill to make our experience that much better. Thank you, Grimaldi's, for making my birthday meal a great, tasty one, and for the awesome coupon! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Yuuuuum! Chewy crust and delicious toppings. Didn't skimp on the toppings either.  Hubby got a free pizza too, for his bday. Had the tiramisu and it was yummy as well. Overall- we will be back!  PS even our 9 yr old was happy :)"}
{"text":"Service was great and the pizza was tasty and appealing. Can't go wrong with a good Caesar Salad and brick oven pizza made with fresh ingredients, toasted to perfection!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Had a gluten free white pizza and a calzone. Both delicious.  Service was a little \"off\" but overall good experience and price."}
{"text":"Went last night, the hostaess saw my group and acknowlege us but asked us to please wait as she then answered the phone, after a few minutes a wautress sat us, after the hostess completed the phone call she then asked if we has been helped. My group and I sat outside by the patio railing. The night was beautiful with a small breeze, the water fountain outside by the patio should be turned off on light wind days, got a little splash as it turns on and off. Not sure if that a mechanism that's in place on windy days. Ordered the cesar salad, the Don and Marharita pizza all food items were great. The disappointment I had was the limited draft beer selection, the only beer on draft was Sam Adams seasonal and others I don't remember. I wanted a Bud light or Stela but they did not have either selection. I went on a Wednesday, I would understand if it were the weekend but I believe the management failed to order supplies. I was hoping the waitress would have informed the manager but she did not come to my table. I was disappointed that this was ignored and I did not feel the waitress should stand there and explain the lack of product. I will probably go one more time and give it a chance but will not go again after that if I run into a similar issue."}
{"text":"Pizza isn't SoO good as everyone say it is. Pizza took a long time, a bit too salty and it came out burnt =\ I wouldn't go back to eat again. Nothing like the EAST Coast pizza."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow and it is not even busy.  Been waiting already 25 minutes fir the pizza. She brought our drinks and has not stopped back since."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the wife. The pizza here was very good. This is NY thin crust style so be aware and is brick oven cooked. We also had a small cesars salad which we shared as well ....very tasty. We indulged in the daily made cheese cake which is to die for!! The best cheese cake I ever had ....better than the cheese cake factory . Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"This place is the best restaurant ever I had very good pizza here. The service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Fell in love with Grimaldi's in 2003 at the original Brooklyn bridge location. Always a bit disjointed when an original goes the franchise route but they do a good job keeping the quality at this vegas location. Recommend the pepperoni."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Grimaldi's at this location for the last 3-4 years.  Love the pizza and the service, for the most part, is usually pretty good.  Not tonight.  When we were seated it was just us and one other party in the whole place.  Within 15 minutes, the place began to fill up (it was about 5) and we had a waiter that was nice enough, but slower than molasses.  After the initial pleasantries, we barely saw the guy.  Needless to say, just about everybody around us that came in after us got their orders first.  We expressed our concerns to management and were given some platitudes about the service industry.  Didn't see hide nor hair of any service after that.  We were gonna order some canolies to take home with us, but we tracked down management to get the bill and a box for our pizza and just left.  We are not demanding customers and are gracious tippers, but not tonight. Can't help but think this place is going downhill - we won't be going back."}
{"text":"These guys lucked out with location, and the amount of business they churn is amazing. We had spent the whole afternoon hiking, and were ready to settle down for some pizza - and they had the highest Yelp ratings. Other than the wait, this was a great experience. And we knew there'd be a wait - we're from the city, it was Saturday night, and it was Spring Training in downtown Scottsdale... we knew what we were in for.  When we were seated, our waitress took great care of us. She got us a ton of water, talked about how they do pizza there, and was quick and attentive. We made a pretty quick decision on a basic salad and a nice pizza, and I don't know if it was hunger or really just delicious pizza, but we managed to kill that food in no time.  Overall, the pizza is thin and crispy, just how I like it. You have to build your own, which can get kind of expensive, but it was definitely worth it. We had a great view of the open kitchen, and we knew when our pizza was being made. It was a bit loud, due to the crowd, but it felt alive. Sometimes, the noise is overwhelming; here, it just seemed right.  We'll likely stop at Grimaldi's every time we visit Scottsdale in the future. The location makes it fun and a little touristy, but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Love the thin crust pizza and the variety of toppings. I used to go to the one in NYC but the atmosphere here is better and the services was excellent."}
{"text":"Should have been easy and they totally blew it.   Ordered online to go a month ago and it went like clockwork.   Tonight I went online, ordered two pizzas.   First available was 1 hour and 45 minutes, ok fine.  Got the order confirmation 2 minutes later.  Showed up exactly on time.   \"It will be ready in 10 minutes\".   15 minutes later. \"Will be soon\".   At the 20 minute mark, one comes out, the other \"will be soon\".  At the 30 minute late mark the second comes out.  The to go cashier was doing the best she could and I remember how efficient she was on my first visit.   I ask her what the Manager instructed her to do for a customer in this situation, offer a dessert, coupon, drink at the bar.   She said she could give me a coupon, told her not her fault and I should not have to ask as this is basic customer service.  Encouraged her to talk to the Manager later and that I was disappointed in the Manager not her.    Obviously the order fell through some internal crack, the Manager should help the team own it to the customer.  Much less irritating then wishful continuous missed estimates to correct.   But wait...it gets better....I get home and they got the order wrong.  My bad I should have checked but i would have been there forever.    I have diet restrictions and could not eat any of it with my family.   Wow.   Oh well.  Two pizzas and I am cooking my dinner very late but at least I have food,  others in this world will go to bed hungry tonight so  I'm obviously okay."}
{"text":"My first time at Grimaldi's ever, and it was terrible. First, the place wasn't really that busy, but my husband and I were told it would be a 10-15 minute wait. 20 minutes later, we were seated. After taking our drink order, it took our waiter about another 20 minutes to get my one glass of wine to me. For dinner, we ordered one large pizza to share and a small salad for me. After 30 minutes, the waiter stopped by for the first time since dropping my wine off to get my husband's Pepsi refill, at which point he mentioned my salad to the waiter. He looked at his notepad, and replied with \"Oh, that's right. Sorry about that, I'll be right back.\" He completely forgot about it. About 10 minutes later, the waiter came to us to tell us the kitchen staff burned our pizza, so we'd have to wait another 10-15 minutes to allow them to finish the second pizza. My salad was better than the pizza. I don't know what all the hype is because I've had better frozen pizzas than what they made. To top it all off, it was half-price Tuesday, and we were charged full price for my glass of wine. My second worst restaurant service experience of all time."}
{"text":"BY FAR the BEST PIZZA in Vegas! They even managed to maintain great service with 2 four year olds at the table and gave them pizza dough to play with."}
{"text":"We just ate here for my husband's birthday. Surprisingly, the pizza was one of the best pies I've had at a Grimaldi's, unfortunately, service was seriously lacking. The waiter never introduced himself, just took our order, and never came back until it was time for our check. Our total was $8.65 because of our birthday pizza coupon and I was planning on leaving the standard 15% (on the full amount) even though the guy didn't do much, but he came back with a 10 and two 1's. I sat there waiting for 10 minutes until the lady trying to bus my table asked if I needed something. He finally came back and I told him I needed to break the $10. So, he gave me 2 $5's. 15% of $26 is NOT $5, or $10. I hate feeling pressured to leave more than this person deserves, so I left him nothing. Sorry guy.   There was a cool balloon animal lady there who made my daughter a Hello Kitty balloon hat! She got the $2 tip from the change that he gave me because that guy wasted 10 minutes of my time.   I would have given 4 stars (house salad was not very good, definitely opt for Mediterranean if you're not one for oil covered lettuce, a lot of red onion, 2 tomatoes & 3 olives) if the service hadn't been completely terrible, but alas, it was completely terrible."}
{"text":"A little bit of Sinatra to set the mood.  First time coming here and the food was fantastic!  We ordered the 18\" don, Caesar salad with grilled chicken, and to end the night with their toffee peanut butter cheesecake.  The pizza is a thin crust and it was cooked perfectly. It was light and crispy.  The sausages were huge!  Everything was great.  The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is that our waitress seemed too busy and left our drinks empty and a long wait because she didn't give us the copy of the receipt you sign."}
{"text":"The Grimaldi's franchise is NOT the same as the cozy original under the Brooklyn Bridge. Lets get that clear. They are getting 2 stars because they are supposed to live up to the Patsy Grimaldi's reputation. They use half the sauce as the original, which is aggravating because pizza at the very least is SAUCE, cheese, and dough. Since they use the real mozzarella, the cheese does not melt and cover the dough, which is fine because that's how the original is. BUT to have large portions on the pizza with NOTHING on it, its bush league. They charge something like $2 for extra sauce, and extra it is not. I wish they would not charge for extra sauce. If you ask for a side of sauce, they will bring you Calzone sauce, with chunks of meat that does not resemble the sauce that goes onto the pizza. You have to specifically ask for PIZZA SAUCE and at a cost of .001 cents to them, I have to wonder why they are so cheap about it.   Other than this, the pizza is like the original. The service is excellent. The staff is very well trained, although it does seem to have high turnover."}

{"text":"I have to say that this place is honestly one in a million. I came here with a friend and had a truly incredible time. But that's not the best part.  After I left I realized that I had forgotten an envelope with money inside! Cash that is completely untraceable and I thought no one would return it. Luckily someone from their AMAZING staff did.  Who ever you are I am so grateful for people like you.  This place is truly amazing. I recommend it to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Grimaldi's pizza but once we moved to Chandler and met Cody (bartender/manager) we fell in love. Tuesday's half off wine night is our favorite but every time we come we've had amazing service, even better food and an overall great time. Tonight Austin was our server and he's also fabulous! They're really doing something right here! We'll be back next Tuesday if we haven't found an excuse to come sooner!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their pizza.  It's the real deal, hence all these other reviews.  This review is solely for pizza takeout, but i think it's pretty fair representative of the other options they offer.  Don't miss this spot while you're around town with munchies or pizza craving"}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience in Scottsdale and it was the best pizza!  We loved it. Great crust, pick your own toppings, great service, great atmosphere.   We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went in here as he had been in Grimaldis before and loved it.  The young lady who greeted us at the door was so over it - definitely not the type you want giving a first impression to guests, she seemed like she could have cared less about anything, except perhaps her cell phone and getting the hell out of there.  Once we were seated however, our server made up for the angsty girl at the door.  Our server was fun and friendly.  We ordered a house salad to split and it was really good - fresh and full of tasty things - covered in a really fresh house dressing.  For our pizza we ordered a veggie pizza and at the servers urging added garlic powder and oregano.  Quite frankly - our pizza was bland - really bland and we were disappointed the crust was delicious but the pizza itself was bland. We think maybe it was the veggie pizza - but doctoring it up with garlic powder and oregano made it much better.   All in all it was a pleasant enough experience and I would go back - but the pizza was a bit of a let down - we will try a different flavour next time."}
{"text":"Visited this location for lunch and the food was really good. I am not a regular pizza eater, but I enjoy the fresh and hot thin crust pizza served here and choices of fresh toppings. Ashley our server was excellent and my compliments to Ivy who puts a lot of love into the salads she makes. It would be nice if the manager would visit with the customers rather than sitting in the back. Then customers could share their stories about why they like this location. Just saying."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza but they have no respect for Giants spring training fans. So save your money and go to Oregano's where they are not pretentious."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's in Chandler.. Ambience...YES...  Sangrias $6! White YES... Red... YES.. great wine list YES... price ... NO... I do not care how great this small pizza was.. and yes.. it was half sausage/pepperoni and half artichoke heart/sundried tomatoe/ricotta Total: $59! IS a whole lotta price for a small pie.. glad I liked my date...since it was my turn to pay.. holy mozzerelly"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Lots of flavor, crust is thin and toasty. Less is more when it comes to toppings. Service was excellent, would highly recommend this place. Brock oven yummyness!"}
{"text":"I would've given 1 star, but the service was very friendly. I ordered 2 pizzas for take out, and both of them were soggy and cold (and overpriced). I was severely nauseous all night. Enough said."}
{"text":"This pizza deserves 10 stars!! I've not had a pizza that compares to this. My hubby and I ordered a Mediterranean salad and the Don pizza, which was all meat - I added mushrooms! The sausage on the pizza is so good, I've never tasted anything like it, really wish they'd come to SC!! Worth the $ which is a bit more that your local pizza places. Others just don't compare- and the cheese was so flavorful."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a five star for their Tiramisu that is made in-house and their friendly, attentive service from our server, Melissa and her assistant Elliot.   I took my Mom here for a late lunch. We were greeted by Elliot when we walked in and asked us if we prefer the booth or high stool chairs. Booth pleeease! And I'm glad we did. I never knew how nice it is in the back of the restaurant. I always came in for dinner and sat in the front area or patio seating. Summer time is great with those booths in the back. Melissa introduced herself and asked if we would like to order any drinks. For two of us, she recommended the large Pellegrino, which was way too much for us. At the end of our meal, I burped and it stung my nose so bad, I had a tear fall down my cheek. Order the small bottle instead. Your nose will thank me later!   We ordered a small Grimaldi's House Salad, which looked more like a large portion! It felt like I drank a tall glass of fresh kool-aid. So refreshing! We ordered their large pizza with green peppers, artichoke hearts, and Italian sausage. My mom creation.. don't ask. Elliot came by with our pizza and asked us.. who would like the first slice. Then asked if we would like any Oregano, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Powder, or Chili Peppers. We added all those to our slice of pizza and the first bite had so much flavor. I did notice that once the piping hot pizza cooled off.. the pizza, itself became stale. The chewy crust was hard as old french bread. Eat it while it's hot and you're good. Once it cools off, good luck!   Now to the dessert. I love their Tiramisu here. I absolutely have to order this every time I dine here. It's made in-house and so is their Cheesecake. The mascarpone custard is creamy, light, and soft. The coffee and rum were so balanced that nothing overpowered one another. If you're in the mood for sweets, this is definitely a place for great Tiramisu!!!   At the end, Melissa, Elliott, and even the happy go manager lady thanked us for dining here and wished us to have a great day. A nice start to the first day of the week. Happy Monday ;)"}
{"text":"Upon walking in, the ambiance is nice and homey with a dark setting- I'd imagine it like coming home during the fall months where it's warm and welcoming with lots of candle lights. We were seated right away and got our orders in pretty quickly.  Our server was outstanding and extremely attentive to our drinks. I ordered a berry sangria and my husband got a coke, we also ordered the Cesar salad and a large pepperoni pizza.   It took about 10 minutes for our salad to come out but it was enough time for us to savor our drinks and chat about our day. The salad was delicious, not full of dressing but the salad was nice and evenly coated with the dressing. We inhaled every piece of it- not because we were starving but because it was that good and fresh on a hot summer evening.  Our pizza came out 20 minutes later which is understandable because it was somewhat busy at 2100 when we went. Upon receiving our pizza, the server served us our first slices and man was the pizza yummy! A thin crusted pizza filled with gooey melty mozzarella cheese, a hint of basil, fresh tomato sauce and baby rounds of pepperoni. Our large pizza had 8 slices, I had 3 slices and my husband had 2. Delicious, simple and a perfect end to our hectic Monday.   All in all, we are definitely coming back. Our waiter Elmer was awesome and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE visit on Wednesday night... Walked in and both hostess just stared at me... No hello, no nothing! So I grabbed a seat at the bar. The bartender was actually great! But unfortunately for her, the lack of leadership from the management is causing the standard of Grimaldi to plummet. My pizza came out Luke warm and cheese barely melted.... I asked for it to be crispy. When the bartender asked if I wanted it fixed, I asked her to point out her manager... Guess who it was?!?! The same person who sent out my undercooked pizza!!! The younger women, who was in charge of the entire place, is sending out a sub par product. She did not even look the part of a manger... No professional attire, poor attitude and a clear lack of standards. Why would i have sent it back to get the same product?? No wonder the staff doesn't care, the manger doesn't! Unfortunately I won't be returning to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"My birthday pizza coupon was about to expire and it was pretty late so we gave this Grimaldi's another chance. It had the average 20 minute wait for a Saturday night, tables were packed, yet service was on top of things. We ordered a pepperoni mushroom pizza and the manager brings it out to us. He says \"how does this pizza look?\" We're sitting there kind of confused because it was on the extra crispy side and had a bunch of holes in it. He followed up by saying \"it doesn't look good and it's not up to our standards. We're giving this one to you for free and we're making another one for you right now. I just wanted to bring this out because I didn't want you to be hungry.\" GIVE THIS MAN A RAISE! That was the best thing I've ever heard!  Our second pizza came out and it was a tad soggy and seemingly undercooked. The food in the end was just a-ok but I felt the need to express my love for that awesome manager (the Asian one, incase you're wondering who to give a raise to Mr. Grimaldi) and give my rating a 2 star bump.   5 stars for service. 3 stars for food."}
{"text":"Never had Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.  But this location at the Palazzo is good but not great.  My wife and I preferred the pizza we had at Lombardi's in NYC.  The sauce was a little bland.  We ordered a cheese and a margherita pizza.  We thought that we would be a true test if it is good NY pizza.  It failed.  We normally don't order pepperoni or any other salty meats but their pizza will probably taste better with a salty meat to offset the blandness of the salt.  Thought the crust was decent.  And the service was awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza! @ Shoppes at the Palazzo Venetian Hotel Location. Highly recommend thisn New York style pizza! Visited one of their restaurants in NYC and this must better! LOL! You can get half and half pizzas too! The ricotta cheese is amazing! Excellent service. Resonable priced! Hard to get too so call ahead and get good directions! Otherwise you have to walk through all of the shops and keep asking for directions!"}
{"text":"Bartenders are always super cool. Servers and host people are always nice. Pizza is amazing , love their wine selection. Their menu is simple yet their are options for everyone! The tiramisu and cheesecakes are so good! Only place I like to get pizza at."}
{"text":"Hello Yelpers :)   Today's visit was to Grimaldi's Pizzeria. I was craving pizza and decided to call in to go.  I called Grimaldi's and Junnie(I think that's her name) answered the phone. Very polite woman.  Here is what I ordered: Small size pizza Half pesto and Half white  I added some toppings to both sides. Junnie repeated the order back to me and told me that she will give me a call back to tell me the total.  20 minutes later.... Still no call back. So I politely called back and asked if maybe they forgot and I didn't mind(maybe they were busy)?  Junnie answered the phone and apologized that she forgot to call back. Then I asked her if I should be on my way to pick up the pizza and she said it should be ready already sincere she already placed the order 15 minutes ago -___-  I got there and a worker opened the door For me(thank you)  I waited by the to go order area and this lady said; \"What's the name for the order?\" Me: \"Karen\" Her: okay your total is $38.92 Me: sounds good, by any chance do you have any ranch?  Her: we don't have that here  Me: oh.... Okay Her: have a great day.  What annoys me the most is that she just Left me with no options. WHERE IS YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE!?  Now on to the actual pizza. PIEOLOGY sh*ts on this place.  Check out the video and pictures attached to this review.  Took a bite out of the white pizza and the crust is so hard and you can taste the char. The bottom of the pizza is burned and not moist, very dry.   I am so sad because I love food and this place received great reviews and I did not enjoy this place at all. I'm sorry I'm not coming back...     I forgot to add.. After I ate Grimaldi's I now have food poisoning. Thank you."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious like a taste not often found here in AZ! Our waiter tommy was great, very attentive to our every need. The salad was great too. Fresh and cold just how I like it."}
{"text":"I am really sad there is not a Grimaldi's closer to me in San Francisco, their pizza is delicious.  There are 2 locations in Las Vegas, I have been to both, I prefer this location to the location in the mall. It has a much nicer atmosphere.  Pizza's are reasonably priced and very filling. Next I need to visit the Brooklyn location and see if it lives up to the orginal. Aparently they ship lots of things in to make the Pizza as authentic as possible.  An added bonus, register on their website for a FREE pizza on your birthday."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Just like the one in Brooklyn New York. Same exact taste. A definite 5 star plus with the food and service. Our server Elmer was awesome!"}
{"text":"Love love loveeee grimaldis pesto pizza! The only down is the inconsistencies at times, sometimes my pizza will be perfect and other times it will be sooo burnt and crisp. But still very good and hasn't hindered me from returning time after time."}
{"text":"I have been to Grimaldi's a few times and each experience has resulted in the same reaction: not impressed. This is not to say that the food is bad. It's just mediocre. I think it's a bit overpriced for what it's worth. I am a pizza snob and I have definitely tasted better pizzas."}
{"text":"We were back a couple of weeks ago, and I don't know if they were better or my mood was better, but we really enjoyed our lunch.  The caesar salad was fantastic and so was the pizza.  Service was spot on, too.  Very enjoyable..."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Thin crunchy crust, fresh basil, pepperoni and cheese! I was going to say, do you need more? And then I remember, do t forget Petite Petit Syrah!"}
{"text":"If your ever craving a great high quality pizza this is the place to go. I love everything I've tried here so far! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"YES!!!  My co-worker took me to lunch here last week and MAN was it good!  The waitress we had was VERY friendly and accomodating too!  (She was half Korean...  my buddy asked her)  We ordered the Mediterranean Salad...  DOPE!  A great salad and even though it warns you about seeds in the olives...  I didn't have ANY?!?!  *shrug*    We also had a large pie with sausage and pepperoni which came out SURPRISINGLY fast considering this pizza was made in a coal oven.  It was a GREAT pizza... and TRUST me...  I have had some BAD pizza.  =/  We also ordered the Large Calzone with meatball and this... was... AMAZING!  =)  My friends all thought there was too much ricotta but...  I LOVED it.  I think it brought out a richness in the meat.  (uhhh...  dont trip...  im straight... REALLY I am...)  Ummm...  anywho...  Yeah...  Grimaldi's...  GO THERE!  I'll probably be back to hit on that waitress or something.  (REALLY...  I'm straight)"}
{"text":"I finally hit this place after much fan fair.  I started with the antipasto plate.  It was decent.  I would have hoped for fresh oregano and basil on top along with the fresh mozzarella.  For $12, I was hoping for a better selection of olives.  The pizza was a price right but the crust was a little lacking.  Almost too thin and crunchy.  It was like pizza on a cracker.  I like the crust to resemble really crusty bread with a little chew.  The sauce was the winner with great fresh tomato flavor and the toppings were top notch.  The beer prices were also not bad."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch yesterday and the food and service were amazing.  Possibly the best brick over pizza in AZ.  But don't forget about their salads.  I love their Caprese salad.  It is so simple and so fresh!  I love this place and need to dine here more often."}
{"text":"I wouldn't provide any stars to this pizza place. Our server was so rude. Also, in my husbands words the pizza tasted like frozen store bought pizza. I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Awesome food with awesome  staff! Extremely courteous! Had The Don with extra fresh basil.. Tiramisu & oreo cheesecake to seal the deal too... And ofcourse a side of Peroni beer CHEERS!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to a Grimaldi's, and it was a great experience. The food was good, the drinks were good, and the service was great. It's not the best pizza I've ever had, but for the price it was a great deal. I got a pizza with pepperoni and meatball which is not something that's easy to find. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. Ken our server was great."}
{"text":"The pizza is AMAZING!! Best I've had in the southwest so far.  Aside from that though, our waitress was terrible today and the red sangria was even worse. Will be ordering to go next time."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's was good...I will definitely go back, but I'm only giving it 3 stars because I wasn't overly impressed.  Which could be to my own fault since I have my favorite pizza places (in California) so it's hard to compare!  While we waited we got a 1/2 carafe of the house red wine...it was actually pretty good, light bodied red (comparable to a Chianti) and only $9!  The salad was mediocre...typical house salad, nothing exciting.  We got the regular red sauce pizza with sausage, pepperoni, red peppers and tomatoes.  I thought it was a little weird that their meat toppings were only $2 and most of the veggies were $4.  Also, they don't give you many options for toppings (mostly meat), but I'm sure if you asked they have others.  The pizza turned out good...a little on the greasy side, but we did have two types of meat on it.  The crust was really good and you can tell the mozzarella was fresh.  Our waitress was nice and I noticed that they all helped each other out.  It seems like this is a great place for groups and families.  Overall, it was a  good dining experience and maybe next time I'll become more of a 4-star fan!"}
{"text":"So, I visited the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge 3 years ago.  Low and behold, I go to Phoenix on business and they have several locations.   Nice clean restaurant with friendly servers.  The pizza with the thin crust is just out of this world.  Made with olive oil and coal oven baked.  The curst is thin but sturdy and crunchy.  So, nice to the taste.   You have the basic cheese pizza, and then can can any ingredients for extra charge.  I had a personal pizza with sausage, mushrooms and olives.  Okay, the sausage was wonderful, the mushrooms freshly cut and the olives freshly cut.  No canned anything.  Outstanding!  Had a small salad and large soda which was refilled 3 times.   Just fabulous thin crust pizza.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This Grimaldi's outlet is located at one end of the shops area of the Palazzo, but instead of getting lost in the Palazzo/Venetian indoor maze that's typical of Vegas casinos, you can easily reach this place via escalator from an outside entrance of the Palazzo that fronts the Strip at the corner of Sands.   You can choose from several pizza options on the menu, or you can customize your own. We went with a meaty combination of sausage, pepperoni, tomatoes, and olives, and it was fairly decent. The toppings were reasonably generous while the crust was somewhat spongy, which from my experience living in NYC is typical of pizza there. There are lots of shareable apps, salads, and desserts to choose from too.  This outlet is open from just before lunch until at least midnight every day. During the mid-afternoon, it's rather quiet, so it's a decent choice for a meal at that time if you've barely woken up all hung over from the night before. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas..."}
{"text":"I think this is my new go-to place for cheap eats when I'm in vegas. The food here is delicious and the price is perfect.   We got a pizza, salad, appetizer, and drinks for less than $20/person. Where else can you get that much food for that price when dining on the strip? The great thing is that you can also build your own pizza.   Service here was a bit slow at times, but our server was great when he was actually tending to our table.   Definitely going back."}
{"text":"The place looks very interesting and just ordered a personal and am waiting on it with excitement!!!! Ordered a personal with fresh garlic, artichoke, jalepenos and sauted red peppers yum much!!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wine were great!! Don't recommend it as a family spot, they're great with kids, gave them dough to play with, but more for a group or date in my opinion"}
{"text":"heard about grimaldi's for quite some time. so i gave it a try! we ordered for pick up only cause i had a busy night of studying and projects to do... ordered 2 pepperoni pies and would be a 30 min wait for pick up which gave me more time to study. we arrived to grimaldi's and for some unfortunate incident, they only had 1 pie ready, so the party of a lot at home waiting, had to wait even longer. but they sat us at the bar, while they corrected our order. and offered us free drinks as we waited for the 2nd pie. after couple minutes, our official order was ready! as a compliment for their ordering mistake, they gave us $10 gift certificate to come back. now, the pizza was yummy! i love me some thin crust. cheese was on point and the pepperoni was sliced just right to fit in your small bite. love love love. enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were dying for some pizza after a long day of walking and shopping. Grimaldis was right in our path so of course that's where we went. The hostess informed us that the ovens were being cleaned and we were more then welcome to order anything else from the menu but we wouldn't be able to get an my pizza for about a half hour, after debating we decided to get a table anyway since our feet were killing us. We ordered a caprese salad, Greek salad, personal pizza and a cheese pizza. Not only did our salads come out in less then 10 minutes, but our pizzas came out way faster then quoted and we were in and out in less then 40 minutes with a party of 5. More then pleased!"}
{"text":"Amazing pepperoni pizza easy cheese was perfect, and the crust was so good.   Service was fast and efficient"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite pizza place to take the family to every week.  After learning today that Grimaldi's has donated $10,000.00 to the \"No on 205\" (marijuana legalization) campaign, my families lifetime boycott of Grimaldi's officially starts today.  I urge other free thinking individuals to join me in this boycott."}
{"text":"The wait list for a table is thirty minutes. Sitting waiting while tables are unoccupied and hostesses are busy chatting .... with each other. One table was set for six and not seated the entire time we waited and while we had dinner. The pizza is always good, but the service is definitely lacking."}
{"text":"Arriving to Boca Park mid afternoon we were seated quickly with only a few tables occupied.  Eager to try one of these original NY style pizzas. After browsing the menu we selected a 1/2 Quatro Fromaggio and 1/2  Garden large 18\" pizza. At first I thought would this be enough to feed the entire fam. Boy was I wrong.    Pizza came out quickly to the table.  First the crust was thin and crispy from the coal heated brick oven.  It was crisy, delicious and flavorful from the way they cook their pizzas. I prefer a bit more cheese on my pizzas but the toppings were distributed evenly for a consistent flavor throughout.  The entire family was completely satisfied with this pie. This is one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas so far and I'm looking to try another one of their specialty pizzas. The prices on the BYO pizzas could get pretty expensive with $2 to $4 each add on ingredient. Ouch!  Grimaldi's has a decent craft beer selection like Lagunitas, Dale's, and Green Flash.  Prices are reasonable, however they do not offer any happy hour specials.  On Tuesday they do offer 1/2 off glass and bottles of wine."}
{"text":"My little brother introduced us to this place and the pizza here is so good.  Reminds me of the pizza in Italy.  We always try and stop here to eat when we are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing pizzas, crust was perfect!! Service was great, pizzas came out quickly. Definitely go back when in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza I've ever had. So yummy!! I dined on November 4th at 8:30pm, I don't remember our servers name but he was fantastic. Tall guy, some tattoos, muscular, with some very pearly whites. His service was kind, welcoming and attentive. Pizza was out of this world! A must have when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"not a bad place for pizza... it is very infomral and the pizza is good... they have a nice beer selection... if you want to get a pie, beer and salad in Old Town and that is all you really want this is the place... the menu is baiscally pizza, beer and salad... but all good..."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza ever! The service is always good. People really seems to care. Been going here for years never had an issue!..."}
{"text":"This is New York style pizza done right. Thin, crispy crust with a sweet sauce and great toppings. Between my parents and I we put away an 18\" no problem, and loved every bite. This will definitely by my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"I have now eaten at Grimaldi's several times now at different locations, but my home is closest to this one so I have done a mix of take out and delivery via DoorDash from here.  When I imagine my perfect NY style pizza, it is pretty much this. Crispy crust, sweet sauce, stretchy mozzarella, and thin crust. It goes down very smooth, and I can pretty much eat this every day and be happy. Short of going to New York, you will be hard pressed to find a better rendition. The toppings here are on point too. I have had the mushrooms and Italian sausage and both are great. Plus I have tried the Oreo Cheesecake and that was also excellent.  It will be difficult for me to go and try another pizza place here in Vegas because I'm so pleased with this one. This from a guy that has probably baked around 100 Neapolitan style pizzas at home over the past 2 years using baking steel and following a hybrid of Jeff Varasano's recipe combined with Serious Eats Pizza Hack. I will still bake some pies myself, but for convenience Grimaldi's will be my go-to spot for quality pizza."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly suprised. I heard this place had good pizza and OMG! If your in the area I would recommend that you stop by. This will definitely be a stop when we visit."}
{"text":"So, 30 minutes turns into an hour ten. Service reeks of move 'em out the door. Pizza sucks: bland, soggy and just not really a pizza for eating, but it looked good.  After the shockingly high bill and ducking management, we knew we'd been screwed. I have learned that the management that cares about their customers respond to reviews on Yelp: THEY DON'T CARE!  Got it?"}
{"text":"Only a buffoon would rate this place less than 5 stars! I have been going to this place since living in Brooklyn NY in '95 where I went to the original! And this place is tradition and is as good or better each time I come! The cannoli cream is the best too. Amazing pizza! Get the sausage and pepperoni and then put all the fixings on it. If you don't like the pizza after that, pls leave and don't come back! Hahahha!"}
{"text":"Only the best pizza place ever. Go here. Get the sausage and pepperoni pizza and out on the fixings (Romano cheese, oregano, red pepper, garlic) and enjoy! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I've ever had!! Can't wait to have it again.. It was so good I came here 3 times in a day (don't judge me) haha. I kept it OG with pepperoni and cheese, it's a thin crust pizza. Every bite is so crisp and tasty. It was on The Food Network for best pizza!! My girl and I love this place,, definitely something worth checking out!"}
{"text":"First timers!! Ordered half white garlic half pepperoni, Caesar salad, of course dessert cannoli. Plus I signed up for their newsletter and received a $5 off coupon. Food was amazing, were so glad we found this pizza place definitely will be back plus our server was so friendly an knowledge she pointed out other items on the menu just to give us ideas."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious! I got take out and they were fast and efficient. I got the dessert trio which was also delicious."}
{"text":"De-lic-opus!  Brought back memories of eating at the original Grimaldi's location at the foot of the Brooklyn bridge with our sweet granddaughter on her 12th birthday trip to NYC. Great memories...great pizza!!!!  Thank you Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"This may very well be the best pizza in Las Vegas! Service is sometimes inconsistent but the pizza is always good ... it's probably the best you can hope for outside NYC"}
{"text":"Had a little time to kill before heading to airport - we stayed at the Venitian so for convenience looked up Grimaldi's . So glad we did! We are from Chicago so wasn't sure what to expect- so yummy! Fresh products! Sausage mushroom and cheese pizza was amazing and the white sangria was really good !"}
{"text":"Over the years, I have vacillated between thin crust and thick crust pizzas. I've always liked thin crusts as a kid, but changed my taste preference to thick crust over the years.  Grimaldi's is a purveyor of the thin crust variety and does a great job of it.   We had a large group (16+) of friends that just wanted to get together and hang out. The majority of my friends are thick crust lovers, so this was a departure from their normal preference. However, since I was paying for everything, there was nary a whine.   All in all, the pizza was very good, and it even managed to convince the naysayers in our group. The service was excellent, and the atmosphere here at the Scottsdale Quarter by Kierland Commons are vibrant and modern.  The only complaint from everyone was the choice of venue's parking. We originally tried to make reservations for the old town scottsdale location, but it was booked up 2 weeks in advance. Unfortunately, this location has dreadful parking. I hope that in the future when additional parking garages are erected, that the perpetual congestion can be relieved.  Parking here isn't so bad in the middle of the day during the week day as I often stop by this area. However, the weekends are simply atrocious.  Otherwise, the restaurant itself was exemplary."}
{"text":"This great NY pizza!  I am from NY and this is the only thing close to NY pizza.  The crust is thin and wonderful.  Sauce is perfect!  If you want great pizza in AZ, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"The waiter said it was the best Pizza in Vegas. Well, I've only had pizza from here and Pizza Hut so I can't call him a liar.  Pizza was good.  It was freshly made and we had pesto on ours (which was a good choice.)   We had a bottle of red that went well with the pie and I called it a good evening."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. The jalapenos here are hotter than usual normal."}
{"text":"This place has great pizzas but the hostess doesn't understand ADA laws with service dogs. She says it's a 20 minute wait. I say there are plenty of tables. She then says we are backed up in the kitchen. Again not that many people in the restaurant. I said ok let's just sit down and order and she then goes and says you can't bring the dog in here. I explain to her that this is a service dog and that she can come with me. She states that this is the rule here and she is aware of the federal laws. I ask to see a manager and tell her that she cannot supersede federal laws on this and she should educate herself or seek guidance from management. She continues to say no and I get frustrated to the point where i start to show my ailment under my shirt that shows my medical condition as to why I have a service dog. I tell her again to talk to her manager.  She comes back and says it's fine and takes us to our table. She said it's a long wait still to be served. The food came on time with out delay. I wish businesses would do a better job at understanding laws and I wouldn't have to show my condition to prove this is real and the dog has to be with. Poor service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at Grimaldi's during our weekend trip to Vegas. We are starving and it was the first restaurant that we encountered, so we decided to give it a try.We arrived about eleven in the morning on a Friday and there were only a few other patrons in the restaurant. It filled up during the course of our meal.  We went with our servers recommendation and shared a small pizza. For our toppings, we picked sweet red peppers, sausage and mushrooms. The size was plenty for two people and we couldn't even finish the final slice. The pizza was good, but far from the best that I have ever eaten. The ingredients were all fresh and high quality, but I felt that the sauce lacked flavor. It was a little bland for my taste.  Our servers were very attentive and helpful. We seemed several servers attending to us, rather than just one. This wasn't the case throughout the restaurant, as a few tables near us were being ignored. A single man seated next to us complained very loudly, as he kept getting passed by and had been waiting to have his order taken from the time we were seated to the time our pizza was on the table. It gave me a negative impression of the service, even though personally our service was very good.  The decor is nice, with lighting fixtures made from glass wine bottles. It's small, but cozy and welcoming.   We had a good meal and experience, but with so many other restaurants on the strip, we wouldn't likely return."}
{"text":"Perfect as always , great service , great draft and outstanding pizza . Love the cooked basil."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great service.  Do yourself a favor and do a meatball, ricotta cheese, and mushroom pizza. Small is good for 2 people fear not."}
{"text":"I feel Grimaldis tries too hard to act/look like a 5 star restaurant, wine glasses, jazzy music etc. Totally felt out of place. Menu has no recommendations on food other than build your own, and they charge for not only the size of the item but absolutely every topping to go with it. I sort of lacked confidence in the restaurant. The waitress never wrote down my order and ended up forgetting that we ordered garlic with our pizza. The employees were extremely friendly I loved there courtesy but after the quality of our meal where the toppings just fell off, our check just for 2 people was 50 bucks. Sorry but I dont plan on returning."}
{"text":"\"Yummy\" doesn't even do this place justice! Great food, good service, and perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in on date night,wifey for the small salad (feeds 2) was very nice and filling for her,I got the Bronx pizza (maybe called the Don)very good and fresh. Our service was very on point and will be back for a sec Rd and a slice of the special cheesecake."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Don't go during peak times because service slips.  Mass serving gives little attention to details. Locals should only go during the week."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a little expensive for pizza, but in this case you get what you pay for.  Their small is like most mediums (16\") and the large is, well, large!  They advertise coal brick oven pizza and that's exactly what you get: delicious, thin crust pizza with very fresh toppings.  There are a several pizzas (combinations of toppings) on the menu you can chose from, but you can also create your own from a reasonable list of toppings and sauce types.  The staff is fantastic every time I've gone.  You're greeted warmly at the door, seated and quickly have the attention of one of the waitstaff.  I've also ordered pizza to go and don't mind the wait while it cooks.  You're invited to sit at the bar, located close to the front of the restaurant, where the bartenders have also always been awesome.  There are TVs over the bar, and I've always been offered a courtesy soft drink while I wait.  They bring the pizza to you, check to see that it's what you want, pay the bill and  you're on your way.  My only word of advise for those who take out:  because the pizza is thin crust, it cools very fast.  I only live a few miles from the restaurant but my pizzas usually need a little love in the oven by the time I get home.  That said, it's never hurt the flavor and I definitely wouldn't avoid Grimaldi's for take-out because of this.  Fantastic restaurant with fantastic food.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The service was very good, and that was the highlight of the meal. The toppings on the Mediterranean Salad were scant and not very \"Mediterranean \". One olive and a few crumbles of Feta does not qualify; please go the extra mile! Our waiter was attentive, and we appreciated that. Sadly, the calzone was underwhelming. This location does not pay attention to detail.  Save the time, and visit the location at Palazzo."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good, a salad I had was mediocre at best. But the service was terrible, just plain bad."}
{"text":"Definitely impressed with this Grimaldi location.  I had heard about this establishment in Tucson, but had never actually been there.  A couple friends were staying near the Ray rd /1-10 area and recommend we meet here for lunch.  I was expecting a small hole in the wall joint, but was pleasantly surprised to see its rather large building.  The decor of the place is very nice and the hostess greeted us in a very comforting manner.  Our waiter was also very attentive and helpful when we were ordering.    The thin crust pizza we ordered was pretty good, but not the best I've ever had.  However, I would definitely eat this pizza with great enjoyment.  Didn't order any alcohol, but the bar appeared to have a pretty good selection of drinks.    The pizza was good, but I was more impressed with the decor of the place and the great staff they have there.  I would definitely recommend this place and hope to visit again very soon."}
{"text":"Always great pizza! The staff here is always so nice. I can't say enough how much I love this place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix area period. Pepperoni pizza has amazing flavor and extremely consistent. Fresh flavor from the sauce combined with fresh mozzarella and brick oven crust doesn't get any better. The Service and atmosphere are excellent."}
{"text":"Traditional New York Pizza, yum!  Served family style so bring your appetite and a group to have fun.  Service was excellent and dinner for a group of 15 was totally within budget.  Thank you and see you again soon!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located inside the Fashion show Mall (1st Level), try to park near the Catwalk. I ended up parking at the Blue Zone, which was at the other end of the mall!  The Pizzeria is small, so make sure to call ahead if you have a big party. They do have a back table that can seat a party of 8. The rest of the restaurant seats party of 2 and 4, but I'm sure they can squeeze in 6 if you get creative.   The manager, Anthony, was great and helpful with the menu and what Grimaldi's has to offer! The service was good, but unfortunately slow....forgotten beer orders and the waiter didn't come to our table till about 10 minutes after our arrival...crickets, crickets, crickets.  We ordered three Large pizza - White, Pesto, and Pepperoni with Sausage( enough for 8) and a Large Cesar Salad (enough for 4, good portions). This restaurant is not stingy and I love it! Our order was sadly mixed up, so they sent out some pizza for us to nibble on before our actual orders came. Thank you Grimaldi's!  My favorite pizza was their Pesto Pizza. I would have to say that their dough here is the staple of everything...so light and crisp! I could eat a whole personal pizza by myself!!! Their pizza is on the lighter side of things, not overwhelming with toppings and flavors. Simple, but good!  The White Pizza was okay for me; I'm a little bias from Secret Pizza's White Pizza from Cosmopolitan, sorry!  The Pepperoni pizza with Sausage was delicious, where I actually enjoyed the sausages more than the pepperoni. Weird, I know...  The decor is here is also very traditional sticking with the New York theme with lots of cool pics posted on the walls. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for any pizza lover and it's casual enough to come for any occasions!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! Just as good as the NYC original. And I would know.   It was a little hard finding my way from the parking lot through the Casino to make it to the restaurant, but once I was there it felt like I was back in NYC under the Brooklyn Bridge. I liked that we walked right past the huge brick oven and the chefs tossing our dough in the air making it right before our eyes. And I also really liked that they gave a little piece of pizza dough for our two year old to play with while we waited for our pizza to come out.  Once the pizza arrived it was just as delicious as ever. I'm a huge fan, and our two year old agreed."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Grimaldi's for some time. Between them and Lombardi's Pizza, there is so much pizza history behind these two names. The antipasto had an OK selection of fresh mozzarella, roasted red pepper, salami and some crostini. We ordered the large 18\" traditional red sauce, mozzarella, basil and added Italian sausage, mushrooms and olives. The pizza came quick and the service in the restaurant was excellent. The pizza had that great coal oven smokiness and just the right amount of char on it add that rustic pizza history piquant to it. The right amount of crispiness and chew to it that make eating a slice satisfying for texture foodies. The sauce was mild, not salty and a little flat in comparison to other artisan pizza places. The cheese was ooey, gooey and not greasy. Overall the pizza was real good and was made a tad bit better with some sprinkles of dried oregano and grated Parmesan cheese. I am glad I had this on my list of places to try."}
{"text":"Meh. If you want a good meal to take back to your room they have take-out. It's pricy pizza--it's Vegas. I should give it another star just because of this."}
{"text":"Recently tried some pizza at Grimaldi's while on a trip to Vegas. Never been to the one in New York but wasn't overly impressed with this pie. Maybe it's different in NY but the crust had almost a frozen pizza quality to it. Maybe we just got a bad one because there seems to be a lot of good reviews..."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's brick-oven pizza is outstanding!! This location is right off Scottsdale Rd in old town. The staff was friendly and accommodated our party of 8 immediately. We came in on a Sunday around noon. This location has a unique personal setting with several event rooms and outside seating. The courtyard would be a nice evening setting with overhead lighting for a more romantic scene."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but they nickel and dime you on the toppings."}
{"text":"From 7/30/16 We stopped into Grimaldi's after hearing their pizza was spectacular. Grimaldi's is located in the plaza in Boca Park, and it was pretty quiet the day we went, not super busy. They have a good wine list, so if you're picky, this place will not disappoint. We ordered a half meatball, spinach, and onion pizza. The service was timely, and our food was so good."}
{"text":"Ok I have to apologize to Julie T if you're reading this, I'm sorry! Don't be mad at me! I lied to you, I said I liked it.  I was probably one of the last in Vegas to try their pizza but I had heard such negative reviews from people I had no desire. But the opportunity came up when my friend and her bf (this is his fav place) invited me, so of course I accepted. Anyways...immediate 1 star for patio seating (and I love love love the white Xmas type lights hanging from the lattice) and for it being Tuesday tasting (half of glasses of wine) I did enjoy my wine. No stars for food.  The pizza looked decent when it came out. Nice big bubbly pieces of cheese, fresh basil on top, looks good?! Well my friend had told me that the ricotta was sweet, I wasn't quite prepared for the taste of it. I wasn't down with sweet ricotta on my pizza. The sauce had no flavor, at least the pepperoni gave it some. I asked the server for a side of ranch \"we don't serve ranch, our pizza doesn't need it\" uh huh, I beg to differ. This is for corporate pizza lovers who don't know any better.  Once again, to each their own, but I will never return."}
{"text":"We usually go to the one inside the fashion show mall but since we lived around the corner, we decided to go ahead and try this location. We will be making the drive to the fashion show in the future. Somehow, the Brooklyn Bridge pizza we always order didn't taste good like the one inside the fashion show. They're pretty steady but not busy and our server has checked on us a total of ZERO times so my drink is empty and I might choke on my pIzza anytime now. The only pleasant thing about this place was the younger hostess who opener the door for us and was very nice. I'm seated in front of the bar area so as the waitress and waiters were making drinks, they like to touch the tip of the straw to put it in the cup. Very unsanitary so I'm hoping they wash their hands often. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The best NY style thin crust pizza I've had in awhile. The pizza is cooked over a coal fire so it has this awesome smokey crispy taste that is perfection. We tried their white garlic sauce which was so delicious! Even my friend who claims she hates white sauce loved it!   We started off the meal with the Grimaldi house salad which comes with a very light vinegrette. Awesome salad to start the meal.   So overall, this place is AMAZING! You have to come try it. The crust is just to die for, and the white sauce is perfect. It wasn't too overpowerful or too creamy. A MUST!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Why you ask? It is all about the basics. The dough, sauce and cheese. Their dough is flavorful and light. It's coal oven baked so it is crispy and chewy. I don't usually eat the crust yet I look forward to Grimaldi's! The sauce is fresh and flavorful. The cheese is sliced fresh mozzarella. Combine all this and it makes my mouth water. The toppings makes a perfect pizza out of this world! I hope one day Grimaldi's comes to California until then I look forward to visiting them whenever I'm in Las Vegas.   Ambiance is very New York style. The service is excellent. Prices are decent though if you're not careful, it can become expensive.  Pizza!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza place IN PHOENIX! The don is one of the best pizzas i have ever had. Its crispy and has GIANT sausages & pepperoni! Not greasy at all! Super friendly service and will be coming back here for a long time!"}
{"text":"Delicious New York style pizza. Nice crust, not too greasy. We tried the Garden, and The Don. Both equal in their own right! Server was very attentive and they served up our first slice. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"On our way home to So Cal, we decided to stop by Grimaldi's in Peoria, since it was both closer and not out of the way, like the Scottsdale one. The last time we were in town, Kathy first tried the one in Scottsdale and just died and went to pizza heaven. I agreed with her as we had it before leaving for home. An interesting note: the one in Scottsdale points to www.patsygrimaldis.com and the Peoria one just points to www.grimaldis.com. I'll need to ask...  We had to take a detour off of Northern, since there was street work being done from out direction. When we finally got there, Grimaldi's was in a new shopping complex that looked like an outlet. The restaurant was facing the movie theatre and it started to rain while we walked in. We sat down and put in our order immediately, since we were dying hungry and didn't want the back and forth. Our usual: Pepperoni, onions and garlic. A nice blend of salty, sweet and savory. Kathy also ordered the mozzarella, tomato and basil salad. The mozzarella tasted store made and not hand made. The waitress did confirm that a company made the cheese just for Grimaldi's.  When the pie did come out, it smelled divine and was just as good as I remember it to be. Kathy thought that the Scottsdale location made a better pie, but I think she is going off of euphoria. The crust was kissed by the coals, thin and crispy. As thin crust pizzas goes, Grimaldi's is head of the class. Pizzeria Bianco is in a class of its own, but that is an another review...  We devoured our pie and I made sure to leave room for tiramisu. I am a maniac when it comes to tiramisu and was very pleased when I dove into the fresh tiramisu on drizzled chocolate. SO fricken good! Chased it with restaurant quality coffee. I can't think of a better way to end a meal.  I found out that the father, Patsy, owned the original Brooklyn location and the son branched out to Florida, Arizona and other states. The name was changed to Grimaldi's from Patsy Grimaldi's after the dad retired.   Overall, if you want a slice of New York pizza, outside of New York, Grimaldi's is your best bet. It only 6 hours from So Cal, but worth the drive...Stay hungry, my friends and good eatings!"}
{"text":"Meh is right  I had high expectations.  It smelled delicious from the outside.  I love thin crust pizza.  I love fresh ingredients.  I love brick oven pizza.  I should have LOVED this place.  Unfortunately, I thought it was the epitomy of bland.    I got a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The toppings were not evenly spread across the pizza.  In fact, half of the pizza had no pepperoni and a few pieces of sausage on them?! (I hate sausage on pizza, blech)  The sauce was sooo bland to me.    The cheese almost had the consistency of low-fat cheese when it melts... like... rubbery.  Yep.  I won't come back."}
{"text":"Took my daughter and her friends here. We ordered 4 pizzas and drinks. The pizzas were all served at different times and the last one which was just a cheese pizza for two of the girls came out close to 15 minutes after the first one. By the time it came out, most of us were through with the first 3. Our service was average at best. As it turns out the 4 pizzas cost us close to $100 and they were small and mediums. Not impressed with this location."}
{"text":"The pizza here was ok, I've been ti Grimaldi's in New York and the place was better there. I think that there is something in the water in New York that makes the pizza and bagels really good there. The pizza here was ok, but I wouldn't really go back. I found the crust to be weird, like I think Dominoes crust might be better. The toppings were ok but not great. The service is what makes this place good. The people who work here are really good. But, the food, not so much."}
{"text":"I don't understand this place.  I feel like everyone eating there is too afraid to speak up and say the pizza is dry and bland because it's cooked in a \"brick oven\" and is supposed to be authentic/good/classy...and because no one else speaks up about how mediocre the pizza is. I should have said something. But I guess I'm saying it now.  The brick oven just saps the moisture right out of the pizza, the toppings, the sauce, everything. I've been here twice, and both times I felt let down. The menu is very sparse, and for a pizza joint that only serves pizza, there are many toppings mysteriously lacking here...."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Empty tables and still long wait.  Waiters fighting with each other over tables. Bad service at bar or no service.  And someone blew chunks in the women's bathroom all over the floor and this was dinner service at 6pm DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"I heart pizza. Grimaldi's may be a chain but they have excellent thin crust pizza. I always get the large with red sauce and pepperoni. Their pepperoni is small, thick and packed with flavor. I prefer the pepperoni over the sausage. The sausage is not bad, but sometimes comes out dry or under seasoned for my taste."}
{"text":"Chicken, spinach, tomatoes on a garlic crust with mozzy cheese was heaven on a plate!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I have eaten Grimaldi's a few times and it has been amazing. I just usually avoid it because I feel it is too expensive. So today (New years) my favorite pizza place was closed so I decided to call Grimaldi's since it is only a mile away from my house. The pizza was done quite fast, however, it look completely disgusting. The cheese looked like it was like wannabe feta. Idk what was going on. The pizza literally was tasteless and I wasn't going to smother it with Parmesan cheese and crushes red peppers for taste. I most likely will not come back. Shame shame shame."}
{"text":"Friendly people and delicious food..... love the pizza!!! Lots of choices for appetizers and main dishes too! A charming quaint Italian restaurant that offers outside patio seating and a fabulous interior featuring their brick oven....  If you haven't been here... it's worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The Don pizza was a bit overcooked, but the flavors were good. The spinach salad was perfect and the caprese was fresh and delicious. The service was excellent and the manager was super friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places!!! I usually get the white pizza with pepperoni. Very simply but delicious. I'm not a fan of red sauce so I'm glad this place offers the white sauce for the pizza. I also order the Cesar salad i love how theirs taste because the lettuce is always chilled makes the salad taste so much better. I live in California and before we leave Las Vegas we always order a pizza to go for the road."}
{"text":"So yummy!  Just like it's original & first Grimaldi restaurant in Brooklyn, NY!  Service was great!  Pizza was so delicious!  If you crave NY pizza, this is the place to go!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first Grimaldi experience and I was blown away.  Huge portions - HUGE.  I had the house salad and it was fresh and tasty.  I did a personal pepperoni and kalamata olive with pizza with red sauce and couldn't finish it, it was so big - more than enough for one person - the tomatoes were extremely flavorful and the pepperoni and olives were delicious.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn, NY. Grimaldi's will always be a staple in my diet. Great pizza, consistent in every location in the US. The host at this location is beyond nice and courteous. Wish I wrote down her name so I could give her a s/o. They will know my name soon, since this is close to my condo and I'll probably be there weekly.  Grimaldi's and Pizza Rock are the top 2 in the city. This visit I ordered the personal with chicken sausage, bacon, and olives. Fantastic. Nuff said."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is amazing. One of my wife and I's favorite pizza places. The staff are amazing and the food is delicious. They are usually busy, so I recommend checking in on the NoWait app in advance. Service is pretty quick, although that seems to fluctuate every time we are there. I would still highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening around 5pm with a group of 6 and were seated with no wait. This location is inside a strip mall and you're able to sit inside or outside. I had a free large pizza coupon for my birthday, which you can get by signing up online. Our server was friendly and service was not lacking. We always had our waters refilled. We ordered:  Large Mushroom Pizza and Large Sausage Pizza: The crust was so thin and perfectly crispy. The sauce had a nice flavor to it. There wasn't cheese covering the entire pizza so I think next time I would order extra cheese. Both toppings were fresh and plentiful but I liked the sausage a little better. Overall, really good flavors.  Jalapeño Calzone: I didn't try this one but my friends were huge fans. The inside was STUFFED with cheese and jalapeños. They did not skimp at all. And my friends who are all fans of spicy foods were literally coughing at the spice but absolutely loved it.   House Salad (Large): For $9 this wasn't bad. It fed all 6 of us and tasted fresh. The dressing was a vinaigrette. If you want more than the basics, go for one of the other salads.   The one weird thing about this place was that they don't have ranch dressing at all. So weird! I always like dipping my pizza in ranch. Overall I would eat here again. The free large pizza + topping birthday deal is awesome so don't forget to sign up."}
{"text":"So good!!!!!  I love thin crust pizza, it's crispy, chewy with lots of flavor.   It was my last day at Vegas with my daughter and we decided to walk round Fashion Show.  When we walked around, we can smell the delicious pizza so we made a bee line to this restaurant.  We just waited for 5 minutes so it wasn't too bad.    My daughter and I ordered the following:  Small House Salad ($7) - The salad had romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and Italian dressing.  It was a very tasty salad.    16\" pepperoni pizza ($18) - it had 6 huge slices.  If you love pepperoni pizza then you gotta try this place.  It was delicious.  I'm salivating just writing this review.   I'm looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  We go there often, with & without winter visitors.  We have always had a great experience there, even when it is very busy. It's clear that the entire staff & management care that everyone has a great dining experience. Special kudos to our server, Emilie. She truly went out of her way to provide the best service. For the first time ever, our pizza was not very good. When we mentioned it to Emilie, she immediately corrected the situation. Great example of how a professional server should proceed. Thanks for yet another wonderful experience at Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Of course my trip would not be complete without stopping by this place. I love the pizza here and I know we have one in Dallas but I just come to this one for some reason.   I know there are a couple of other good spots but I love the service here. I always sit at the bar whether I'm alone or with a friend.   Shawmbi was the bartender this night and he was awesome. I made a new friend at the bar too. I gave her a couple of slices of my pizza and she said it was \"yummy\". We then went on to play some craps after we finished our meal. ;) This is like the third time I made a friend at the bar and we went on to play some craps.   So if you love pizza you should def give this place a try. It's thin and always comes out in good time and hot. The kitchen is open late and you can also get your pizza to go if you don't want to dine in.   The salads are huge here just so u know. I could not finish mine. They have lots of toppings for pizzas. I haven't tried anything else on the menu though. It's all about the pizza for me.   Order a small pizza if you're alone. Sometimes it can even be enough for two depending on your appetite.   Prices are very reasonable too. Of course I'm going back next time."}
{"text":"\"Where everybody knows your name\" -CHEERS THEME SONG lol;) We always sit at the bar to eat and Kurt takes good care of us. He knows our names and we feel like family when we come in. He has our order by heart and has somehow managed to remember all of the wines we tried and if we like them... I can't even remember what I had for lunch last Tuesday lol! Vince always stops by to say hi and makes sure we're taken care of, even when it's crazy busy. This location truly has that mom and pop feel when you get to know everyone. The pizza is on point! Sorry New York, sorry New Haven, sorry Chicago... I've tried all of your pizzas and Vegas has you beat... **mic drop**"}
{"text":"One of my favorite of two spots in Vegas to get great pizza and they have killer cheesecake.  Friendly service the bartenders are great.  The pizza is nice and crispy on the crust and fresh ingredients served and topped  with delicious cheese.  I go here at least 3 times monthly ! And I'm very picky about my food and where I get it!"}
{"text":"We love Grimaldis and last night's experience didn't change that! This is the place we go to for pizza in. Admittedly it isn't great takeout or leftover. The consistency among the locations is something you can count on which is awesome!        Johnny was our server and was great! When we arrived the dining room was packed but we were seated with no wait. Johnny greeted us with a smile and took our drink order. I ordered a glass of the Ruffino Chianti but also asked for a taste of the house as I was curious of a $4.00 glass. He was very accommodating and with a smile. Needless to say, I'll stick with the Ruffino. LOL At this time you can see the restaurant is emptying out and servers are bustling around to wrap up with the exception of Johnny who still was waiting on guests. Must be the closer! This is when I noticed an area of service that lacked. Not for us personally but looking around you could see Johnny and one other server running their butts off while others visited in the corner by the bar or where going about their side work duties. No big deal but as a former industry manager myself I really appreciate it when I see teamwork during and after service. The food is always amazing and we love Grimaldis! We missed getting to visit with Brandon in the bar who is always great but maybe next time. Note: my boyfriend would love to be able to have a Vodka Soda here! Why no liquor??  Keep up the good work Grimaldis Old Town! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Another fantastic night at Grimaldis in Old Town. We have had Johnny wait on us the last two times we've been in and you should be one happy management team to have him on your staff. He's very professional yet friendly without being intrusive. Good service staff seems to be hard to come by these days and it shows at many restaurants in town but not here. Thank you Johnny! The food is always great!  One critique: The red wines are a bit too warm."}
{"text":"Outstanding New York Style-thin crust pizza with great flavor. Probably the best pizza, I have ever had on the Las Vegas Strip or ever.  We came here with a group of 9. The ambiance of the restaurant is cool, with a classy brick decor with modern touch and vintage New York Black and White Framed Photos throughout the restaurant.  We Ordered 3 Large Salads (Antipasto, Mediterranean and Cesar Salad). All 3 of them were fresh was more then enough to feed everyone a fair amount. The Mediterranean salad was definitely the surprise winner of all the salads. Next came our two large pizzas (All Meat and then Pesto with Chicken) The all meat had killer flavor and the meats all mixed in perfectly.  The Pesto and Chicken was alittle to trendy for my taste, I'm all about meats on my pizza.  The portion size of the pizzas were generous and the price to feed all 9 of us was less than expected and totally reasonable."}
{"text":"When you go into a restaurant that has so many awards on the wall, it sets the expectation that the food and service will be worthy of those accolades. Nothing could have been further from the case when we went to Grimaldi's at Park West. The service was awful , taking an inordinate amount of time to take our drink order then serving me the wrong drink , then taking over 40 minutes to deliver a small pizza and a personal Pizza to the table.  Pizza just isn't that hard to get right. But Grimaldi's has missed the mark almost entirely. What they served was poorly cooked substandard ingredients on what I can assume was some kind of flatbread crust that was the consistency of fiberboard.  Unless you are a thin crust aficionado you will not get anything remotely resembling pizza at this restaurant, and the food in general is not worth the price Kama which is exorbitant! For a small pizza, a personal pizza and 1 Fountain beverage our bill with tip was $53.   I didn't complain to the management because I was late for a movie , mostly due to the slow service.  It was the only place open at 9 p.m. it was close enough to the theater where we had a shot at making our film. We should have just eating popcorn. My recommendation is to avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Great service & nice place to dine but way over priced for mediocre pizza. I got take out and waited 30 minutes to eat my order  & I was not impressed. A medium pizza cost me $23.00. They charge for every topping. A mom & pops place like Familia pizzeria on Durango & Windmill makes the best NY pizza."}
{"text":"food was yummy, but hostess was terribly rude! rolling her eyes and shaking her head. also the waitress was not too attentive, no bread as well as my drink being empty for 10 which is a shame on my first visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizzas and extremely busy in the best sense of the word. Grimaldi's touts a  New York style crust that is hard to find and it is top notch. (curiously they have no locations in N.Y.C)   I was not surprised that the quality of the toppings used for standard and  \"themed\" pizzas were also of high quality.  As an Angeleno, I am more impressed with Gilbert and its unique sense of identity as a city and its surrounds (minus Mesa, 'natch)"}
{"text":"Loving this pizza! Ordered half white garlic half pepperoni pizza, onion spinach garlic pepperoni and green pepper calzone, spinach salad and cannoli omg yum!  Great service didn't have to ask for anything the server was on it!"}
{"text":"Super thin crust, fresh mozzarella, and bland sauce. 7-9-5 would be the scores respectively our of 10.  Coal fired, with water adjusted to NY mineral levels shows great attention to the crust. However the sauce while not sweet it lacks flavor it could some some basil, oregano and or garlic. The cheese is great however.   We had a large cheese pizza $18.99 a bit steep but not terrible for a sit down gourmet esque. However due to the thin thin nature and blobs of cheese there is less overall pizza than other thin crust places like NYPD.  This place has a long laundry list of toppings, this is why I think the sauce lacked flavor as most don't miss it when they add on a whole meals worth of meat and veggies to a pizza.  The menu is simple salads pizza stomboli's and desert.   Overall its a decent option for a nicer pizza in this area of town."}
{"text":"My co-worker brought this place to my attention. He said, and I quote, \"For the best thin crust pizza you will ever have, go to Grimaldi's!\" At that time I was thinking thin crust is just thin crust. So when me, my wife, and a friend were hungry for lunch, I remembered my co-worker's quote so off we went to this location.  From the moment we pull up to the front door, the hostess was there holding the door open for us, greeted us politely, and sat us down right away. Our server, Kent (who was very nice and cordial), told us everything we needed to know once we told him we were first timers.   Their menu is simple to read and understand, especially after Kent explained it to us in further detail. We got the large (18 inch) with pepperoni, mushrooms, and garlic. One bite from my slice and I was in heaven. From that point on, I knew this was gonna be the measuring stick for any thin crust pizzas I eat from now on.   The prices are just a little more than your average pizza joint. But with that said, it's actually worth it according to what my stomach told me. This is probably the only place that I don't mind spending extra not having to think twice about it. It's that good!  The service was outstanding. I didnt have to ask for anything! Refiils were constant and we were constantly being checked on. If this was any indication of service from all their locations, then I can't wait to eat at the next location! Hay, even their bathroom was nice and clean! That's a bonus!  So if you got this far down in my review then, what are you doing? Go eat at Grimaldi's! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good but not remarkable pizza. Decent selection of wine available. Quick service. The condition of the bathroom cost them a star."}
{"text":"Pizza crust was soggy because it was too thin. Our server was good but a little too busy to give us her full attention.  We used to really enjoy their pizza even though we're not big fans of a thin crust.  Not a horrible experience but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant for the first time yesterday with my husband's family. They lived in NY before so they have tried the restaurant in NYC and they enjoyed their pizza a lot so we decided to give it a try here in Scottsdale too. We were a big group of 8 (inclusive of 2 children) so we were offered the private room which was fine with us.  The private room was set up in less than 5 min and we wee called in. Our waitress soon came in and introduced herself and took our drink orders. When she came back with our drinks, we placed our salad orders as well as our mains.  The salad came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered the House salad and so did my mother in law. Although we placed our order at he same time, it took at least 5 min or more for her salad to come out. We were surprised why it took so long between the two! Never mind though. The mains to follow compensated for that.  Our order for mains was 3 pizzas, 1 cheese, 1 veg and 1 special (artichoke with Kalamata olives). Out of all three, our fav was the third one. Very tasty and fresh, what differentiates their pizza from other places is the fact that they cook it on coal! Very yummy idea!  All in all, service was great, food was tasty and atmosphere was nice! 4 rather than 5 stars? One needs to be super impressed before throwing in that last super star ;) Recommended and will be going there again!"}
{"text":"The best!! Absolute best!! My favorite place always! And the staff is just as wonderful as the pizza!! Alex J. Is the best waiter we've ever!! I will always come to this location."}
{"text":"Been here and to this location so many times, food is great and service is even better. As a chain it's crazy to see how good the pizza is! Thin crust, nice and crispy!"}
{"text":"Okay. I'll start off with this. I have been going to the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge since it was Patsy's. Over 25 years. I absolutely was thrilled to see this place at Boca Park since my wife and I just moved from the Big Apple in July of 2011. This review is based on a visit in Sept of that year.   The only thing this place had in common with the original Grimaldi's is the name. Sad. I don't remember much, but there was nothing special about it. I have I guess two categories for pizza. There's NY pizza and everything else. So I can eat a pizza and say this is one of the best I've had, or one of the best I've had outside of NY. My standard in pizza comes from places like Grimaldi's, Patsy's in Harlem, L&B Spumoni Gardens, DiFaras, etc... This place was nothing more than a chain pizzeria licensing the name.  The pie was bland, toppings terrible, no taste really. I will never go back. The waiter was really nice though."}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. The wine and pizza were both good."}
{"text":"When 20 people show up for dinner it's not right for the manager to tell them to go for a two hour walk and he'll call when they have a table ready. There were at least 2 vacant tables that we could see from the street.  He was very arrogant. I am only giving one star because there is no option for 0 stars ."}
{"text":"Great Pizzas!  Very tasty. I can see why this is the place to go. Will come back again. Pretty pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Where I'm from originally we don't have Grimaldi's so I've never had it until I moved to Arizona.  There is something unique about Grimaldi's and how they do pizza. Is it the best pizza I've ever had? No. Is it a darn good pizza? Yes. I have had a few different options, my favorite being the white pizza.  My one gripe with Grimaldi's is the price, it is not even middle of the road in price - this may be one of the more expensive places I've ever had a pizza from.  I recommend this spot though, I've only been to the one in Old Town and it never disappoints in terms of taste and quality."}
{"text":"Probably your best choice of restaurants in Fashion Show Station. Caesar salad was decent. We added chicken to the salad which was not the greatest for grilled chicken so I would forego that next time. The Brooklyn pIzza was excellent with delicious ricotta cheese. The server brought us the check before asking if we cared for desert which she had to redo since we did order a piece of cheesecake which was pretty good .The Cappuccino was average . We would come back for the pizza for sure!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations given their reputation but I'm sorry to say I've had much better elsewhere. I love thin crust but this pizza was dry and crumbly although not overcooked. It also lacked flavor. I didn't see any tomato sauce whatsoever like it was \"forgotten\"? Definitely overpriced when you add on toppings. This place was super packed but luckily you can reserve your place in line via yelp. Parking is a pain as well. Service was fine but I don't see a reason to come back. I just don't get the hype about this place, it's not awful pizza just not great like I expected."}
{"text":"It's a chain and I'm a fan. If you like other Grimaldi's (and I do) then you'll like this one. I love their thin crust and it's blistered and charred texture. I'm still not a fan of their pricing -- toppings are the same price no matter if you get a small or large pizza -- but I can overlook that when eating some good pie. We got a white pizza with onions, mushrooms, and pepperoni. Delicious! They skimped on the pepperoni, though.  The place is kid-friendly, of course, and I like how they give kids some pizza dough to play with. It not only kept my little guy busy but educated him about the food he was eating. Telling him where his food comes from was kind of like a \"birds and bees\" conversation, but less awkward.  The relatively high pricing prohibits this place from being in our regular rotation, but it's great to have occasionally."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar and had a Peroni on tap.  Decent size for $5.  Bartender was attentive and helpful with the menu throughout my visit.  I ordered a small house salad which was actually quite large.  It was well dressed with lots of fresh veggies, but could use a crouton crunch.  They were cool with me subbing black olives instead of green, too.  The margherita pizza was very good.  Had a nice thin crunchy crust and fresh mozzarella and basil.  No complaints.  I also took home a cannoli which I still haven't tried yet but it looked pretty tasty.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Oh Grimaldi's how I love thee. It's probably my favorite pizza place in AZ. I love the thin crust & and the tiny pepperonis they use. The pesto sauce is pretty good, also. I also love the roasted red peppers in their house salad.  I'm pretty sure I've reviewed other locations and rated them 4 stars but this place ranks 3 stars compared to the others. Service is not as great. One time we stood in the lobby waiting to get acknowledge by someone for almost 10 minutes and had to walk into the dining area and flag someone down to get us seated."}
{"text":"Delicious! Salad was fresh, pizza was tasty and their trio dessert was a taste of everything."}
{"text":"Its different then most places because of their type of ovens. One of my top 3 places in las vegas for pizza."}
{"text":"I have not been here in a few years. I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was. I have been trying all these other pizza places in town which are top rated and I found a few but my food here was fantastic. I had a Greek salad which was a good portion and a jalapeno and mushroom pizza. Crust was perfect. Going back here soon."}
{"text":"This peperoni pizza was so amazing I went back the following day for another pie! Worth every penny!!! Amazing"}
{"text":"I ordered the margherita pizza. It was lacking in cheese, barely any on the 16\" pie. I would recommend you order extra with it if you'd like at least a piece of cheese on each slice. Some slices didn't have any at all. The sauce is delicious, and the seasoning was great."}
{"text":"Very good transplant from Brooklyn. But obviously not the exact same as the original. There is no long lines wrapping around any corner waiting for a seat at this one. But it is a good thin crust pizza.  This one is much fancier than the original. They have a host that seats you, a very nice dark wooden bar, and large wine glasses at every table in case you order a bottle. Nice brick walls with framed NYC pictures hanging through out.   Our waiter was great. Very polite and would give us updates on our pizza. Too bad I forgot his name but his a tall white man that is bald, if I remember his name I revise this review because he deserves to be mentioned.  A large can fill three to four people and the have many topping, including a white pizza and other Italian dishes.  You can't go wrong here if you like a good thin pizza pie!! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"My friend and I were driving around trying to find something to eat. We came across Grimaldi's and decided to give it a shot. We were not disappointed in the least.  We came at the end of lunch so it was pretty empty. We were greeted by a lovely lady who sat us down and went over the menu with us after we said it was our first time.  Our server came by shortly after and once again went over the menu with us. Menu is definitely short and sweet into the point. He walked us through the beverage menu and we ordered a couple of sangrias.   A few minutes later my friend ordered one small pizza for herself and I ordered one for myself as well. We decided to share a small house salad also. We were surprised by his reaction when we ordered two small pizzas. As soon as they came out we knew why.  The pizzas are huge for being small. And the price that you pay for them is pretty phenomenal. I chose to start off with a traditional white pizza. White sauce with mozzarella and garlic and I had a bacon and pepperoni. She went with the margarita pizza. Both were 5/5.  My pizza came out first and unfortunately then put it in wrong. But both the manager and the server apologized. He told me I could have add it but that my pizza that I ordered was coming right behind it. I finished two slices of the mistaken pizza and it was phenomenal. My friend had two slices of her own.   When my pizza, the one that I originally ordered, came out it was worth the wait. Had two slices of that one. We were completely stuffed. The service was impeccable. Very attentive. Everybody was surprised that we never been there before.  At the end of the meal they brought us out a complementary Oreo cheesecake. Cheesecakes are made in house. That was also a 5/5.   We ate most of the cheesecake and got boxes for our pizzas. We had leftovers for about two days. I have to say that the attentiveness and the level of customer service of this place made it go from a 10 to a 10+.  I love the East Coast since my family is from there and you got a real East Coast five. Everything from the subway station signs to the friendliness of the staff. I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from friends, so gave it a shot. Its in the Palazzo upstairs by the shops.  Service was great, fast - got our salad out quick. The pizza (pepperoni, mushrooms and spinach) was very good. Baked perfect - crisp on the bottom. Cheese and sauce were great. Got the tiramisu for dessert and it was phenomenal. My wife got the Girl Scout cookie cheesecake and it was very creamy - topped off with a cup of cappuccino and it was a perfect lunch.   Reasonable prices as well. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The pizza was very good however it lacked a lot of flavor. The crust wasn't burnt and very crispy. Good size pizza for 7 people. Didn't like our waitress much, took dishes out of people's hands or stood behind you to wait for you to finish. No wait and very nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"We've been here once in a party of 6 and had a pretty okay experience. The food was good and the salads large just not the traditional Italian food we are used to. Also a big setback for us was the prices for the authenticity. Could recommend for a big party but not my first pick."}
{"text":"As a fan of the other 2 Grimaldi's in Scottsdale I was excited to see this spot open.  The space is well-decorated reminiscent of the NYC subways.  It's got a large dining area with some additional seats in the back as well as some patio seating with a half inside/outside bar.   The servers are friendly and refreshingly competent without the attitude.  The food, however,  wasn't as good as have had at the other locations.  I've only had a pizza and calzone at this location but both times were just ok.  They use fresh mozz and the flavors were pretty good.  The crusts weren't as crispy and a little bit too charred with a lot of soot.  I love the crusts but had to throw away a good 1/3 or so of the pizza.  Not sure if they're still tweaking the process but holding out hope that they'll get their act together soon."}
{"text":"The food is good, but once we received our food we didn't see the waitress. We had to track her down 2x to even get the check. Service is lacking."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been here a thousand times and I decided tonight was the night to finally post a review. I absolutely love this place! I have had all sorts of pizzas and salads and everything is incredible. My personal favorite is the pepperoni. If you haven't asked for the garlic powder ask! Is awesome on the pizza!!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, Las Vegas has a lot of bad Pizza. This place is not one of them. Good quality authentic fold it up New York Pizza. Great sauce, great toppings, great people. I highly recommend. Sign up to their club for a free pizza on your birthday!"}
{"text":"You can't miss with Grimaldi's.  They have great thin crust pizza.  The meatballs and sausage are very good. The spice is excellent.  The pepperonis are not the giant circle's most people are used to. They are nice, small disks. Not over powering but taste yummy. The pizza has just the right amount of cheese and sauce. I had the pesto there as well which was very flavorful.  You can order a small or large pie for the table or a personal pizza for yourself.  The service is fast and efficient.  Pizza done right should not take too long.  I live in NJ and know about good pizza.  To have a Grimaldi's on the West Coast is a blessing.  My parents could never find good pizza out there.  Next is Chinese food. And yes, this kicks Setebellos butt!  Café Rio is next door, that's extra points!"}
{"text":"I have been to Grimaldi's in NYC and fell in love with their pizzas. As soon as we found out that Palazzo has a Grimaldi's location, how we could not eat their pizzas when in Vegas?   There is both indoor and outdoor seating area and we sat outdoors. Ordered a garlic white small pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni. My husband and I split the pizza and it was sufficient for the both of us.  The pizza seemed to be too greasy. As we dug out the last few slices, I noticed that the crust had gotten soggy because of the amount of oil on the pizza plate. We liked the pizzas here, but didn't love it"}
{"text":"Great experience. Food was good, loved \"the don\" pizza and the bruschetta with the olives. We weren't rushed and Lori was very attentive plus she made great suggestions.  We went to the one in the fashion show mall and this location was better.  We will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Gotta love Grimaldis. If they went to all the trouble to open these Las Vegas locations which basically taste exactly like the original location in Brooklyn then it is our duty to come here and devour these world class pizzas. Side of meatballs never disappoints either. Crazy Bernie says you're crazy if you don't eat at Grimaldis at least once when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Now Vegas has 2 reasons why I dont need to go to new York anymore. Perfection in a 900 degree coal oven"}
{"text":"Grimaldis is currently my favorite pizza place. I don't think it gets better than this. I've been to 2 other locations (Chandler & Old Town) and this one at Santan Village for the first time last night.  They have all been consistently good. We shared a large pepperoni, mushrooms with extra cheese. Yum, I love the mini pepperonis they use. It's not too salty and makes a perfect combination with their crispy thin crust and fresh mozzerella. They don't overdue it with the sauce either. The whole pizza is well balanced out.   Last night we were seated in a high top table that allowed us to see the pizzas being made. The guys behind the counters were carefully assembling each pizza. They layered the toppings out in a uniformed manner to ensure each bite would include all the toppings. No need to fight for the slice with the most scrumptious overload of toppings; they all came out the same to make choosing one easy :)   Their menu is simple. Salads and pizza, that's it. All their salads are pretty good as well. They're usually lightly dressed which I like.  Service was average. Nothing to complain nor rave about."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to eat there because I called at 10:59 and they closed at 11 (after a previous call to them and they said we could come in last minute- otherwise I would never do that to the waitstaff) and the girl on the phone- in the pipsqueakiest girl voice was like \"I mean, if you run here in the next minute then whatever-Iike, if you can get here in time...\" No sympathy, no hospitality - and ps? In no world am BOLTING through the Palazzo so I can make some 21 year old hostesses' time clock. Bad attitude on that girl- we get you wanna go home, don't take it out on us- especially when your coworker said it was cool. She sucked."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but not great.  They have different pizza basic options ... And you add toppings at. $2-$4/ea from there.  It can get pricey fast if you let kids order.  They only have one special 'defined' pizza.  Personally, I like to see what chefs come up with - if I want to make my own, I'll call a delivery service.  Big wine selection ... But wine and pizza don't go for me.  Lots of lagers and hoppy ales - no stouts, porters or brown ales (I don't count Newcastle anymore)"}
{"text":"never had this style of pizza, and it was great. we could not decide so the waitress suggested a pizza with half and half. it was great! Sat outside in a wonderful seating area."}
{"text":"Nice crispy crust.  Came here the other night and ordered a pie at the bar, with a couple of beers.  Definitely  an Old Town Scottsdale institution.  Their calzone looked pretty good, and enough for two people, unless you were the 135 lb guy sitting next to me, that scarfed down the whole thing himself.  I mean if he ate it all, it had to be good.  They also have some pretty good local beers on tap and by the bottle.   I'll definitely add this  my repertoire of AZ pizza haunts."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Embarrassingly, I never went to the Brooklyn Grimaldi's when living in NYC, but this was a great sampling.  The service was great.  The location is great - upstairs in the Palazzo.  But my highest praise is really for the pizza, since it is truly amazing!  My husband and I split a small (16\"), with half kalamata and half pepperoni. They gave way more generous toppings than expected, to where there were multiple olives in each bite. The crust was thin, but still a little thicker than traditional fast food pizza chains (which I liked), and the crust was crispy yet still had a little bit of soft chewiness (my perfect combo).  Definitely would come here again, hands down."}
{"text":"Great pizza. The caprese salad is awesome. I love the mushroom, pepperoni, sausage, and basil pizza. Awesome will come back."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and wasn't really impressed. The prices seemed high and the portion of toppings on our pizza minimal. We ordered a ham and mushroom, but I don't think there was even a half of cup of mushrooms on it for an entire 16 inch pizza. However, our server- Nicki-was awful and made us feel like we were a a waste of her time. We had a coupon for a free pizza (sign up on their website in order to get a free pizza on your birthday), yet she seemed annoyed we were only paying for 1 extra topping, no drinks and no appetizer. Therefore our bill only ended up at $2.15! She never asked if we needed refills on our water, and only came by once right after delivering our pizza to see how it was (umm we barely took one bite by that time). Her attitude all nite was just bad. The only reason I might go back is next year if I get another free birthday pizza coupon..."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing pizza, and really really hot bartender named Kurt. Check out the pesto sauce ... Delicious! Great assortment of wine too. You can try them out if you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"This was an OK experience when I wanted it to be a crazy delicious. The server was a bit unorganized and came back after our salads were served to apologize that the kitchen had run out of tape in their ordering machine, so our pizza orders just barely went in. Then she brought the wrong size veggie pizza and we just let it go because she seemed so harried. The manager did come over to tell us there was no canola oil in anything, which was good as my sister-in-law is allergic.   The pizza was good, but again, not mindblowing. The atmposhpere is nice and location really good in downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I have lived my life this long without a Grimaldi's Pizza!    Have driven walked and stumbled by many times in various locations in this city but never gotten to try it.  My loss...  Until now!  The service is nice from start to finish with pretty quick service.  They have a bar for cocktails while you dine (and have the coolest wine bottle chandeliers I am going to recreate in my bar at home) lots of wine to choose from.  The greeter is nice and the staff was great.  Night before Christmas Eve it was busy from the nearby stores but the food came quickly not a worry.  Because it was my first and I am kind of a Pizza fanatic I had to start slow and continue slow to truly enjoy the flavors.  When you take your time this Za has so many underlying flavors that you will miss if you dig right in.  The \"Coal Brick-Oven\" is true and it is AMAZING!  A soft Smokey flavor with every delicious bite of all the other flavors of you're choosing.  It is an ala cart pizza style so it can add up but with flavors like this it is worth the price.  The ambiance is awesome, decor beautiful as I mentioned I am totally going to have the wine bottle chandelier in the near future.  Service is nice fast and efficient and the food is great!  Well worth the slightly increased price but when I make my Gourmet pizza at home WITHOUT the coal brick oven, it cost about this to make so yeah, worth it."}
{"text":"This place is now officially one of my favorite pizza places! A member of our group swore that this was the best pizza she's ever had so naturally we had to try. We were talking out front and decide that a large would be perfect for our group (6 girls). One of the employees told us that a large is good for only 3-4 people, but my friend insisted we stick with it. Im glad we did because the large was more than enough for us.  We got the Brooklyn Bridge pizza which took about 20 minutes. We brought it back to our hotel and it still tasted AMAZING. I bet it would have been even better if we had eaten it there at the restaurant. I highly recommend trying this place. It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Good music, good pizza, good service. I really enjoyed eating here during my last visit  to the Phoenix area. We went in the evening on a weekday, so the restaurant was more on the empty side. We decided to sit outside to take in the warm evening. It was nice having good background music--it was eclectic and fun, and wasn't too loud or too quiet. And despite coming near closing, the service was fantastic. Our server was extremely attentive and funny. The food was excellent. We ordered a house salad to split and a large pizza with mushrooms, sausage, and peppers. The salad was really yummy--great dressing and  flavorful greens (not just a bunch of bland iceberg lettuce). The pizza had a very thin crust and high quality toppings. Our only complaint was as you got towards the center of the pizza, the crust got soggier and soggier. Would have liked it to be cooked just a hair longer. Other than that, we had a great time at Grimaldi's. Would definitely recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Very good experience dough for kids to keep calm.  Will return well worth it.  Pizza was tasty and salad awesome.  Nice music and great staff to handle the table."}
{"text":"Every time I order over the phone. It's always something. Pizza dough over proofed so no lunch menu? Last time the oven wasn't stocked. And before that it's took over a hour to have my personal salad to be ready, A salad. Come on....the food is great when ever they do have them selfs together. I give up on ordering anymore"}
{"text":"Our server was very attentive, and not to mention good looking! Since it was our first time there, he told us some of the history of the restaurant (none of which I obviously remembered lol).   We split a ceasar salad 4 ways (yummy). 3 of my friends split the big calzone (could easily feed 3 people) and I got a personal pizza. It was all delicious, was a fan of the thin crust!"}
{"text":"I love this Brooklyn chain.  They did an incredible job with the interiors, it's very upscale casual.  I had the large cheese which feeds 3 comfortably and 2 hungry people.  We did ours with extra sauce and extra cheese.  Definitely the way to go.  Now they need to open one up in Atlanta."}
{"text":"I have created the ULTIMATE pizza at this place and I am feeling generous enough to share my glorious toppings combination under one condition: you must refer to it as the 'King Sam' pizza....  Don't believe it's that good? Your crazy, try it and then thank me later...  The KING SAM: Any Pizza with these Toppings: -Pesto -Chicken -Garlic -Onion -Jalepeno  ** if you like hot pizza, put a dash of Tabasco on it for the final touch... wow.   You are welcome...  And Grimaldi's -- Keep up the good work, our company Sitevoice across Market Street are all big fans of the good food you produce time and time again."}
{"text":"Very disappoint went to have lunch with my wife were looking forward to eating here we were told we had to sit outside ask if we could sit inside the guy says no it's closed but customers were sitting in the area what happened to pleaseing the customer"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I have ever had! This is the place I send all my family and friends. I've celebrated birthdays and events here. The service is always excellent. The ingredients used to make the pizzas here are top notch and after a few slices you will be reluctant to order from your neighborhood pizzeria. My suggestion is the meatball and extra mozzarella pizza. The mozzarella here is the best I've ever had. I'm not an easy person to please when it comes to pizza because I've felt like I've had all the best slices but this place takes the cake."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It's conveniently located at the Palazzo mall right by the entrance. I've been a regular to the BK, NY location for about 7 years back and was so excited to see one here when we were walking through the shops. Pretty slow night for them and yet the service was bit slow at the bar. That being said, if you have never tried pizza from a coal fired brick oven, you owe it to yourself to try it and this place does it right. We ordered one traditional margarita pie with extra roma tomatoes and one classic pie with meatballs and bacon. Both pies were great. They are also known for their calzones. A small calzone is more than enough for two people. The pizza was incredible, but it's not as good as you'd get in NYC. Granted, this is probably psychological! I'm still willing to bet it'll top all other pizza offerings in Vegas.  All in all it was an amazing meal and I would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for take out here .. place was nice , clean and customer service was exceptional.. My order came quick and the pizza was pretty good .. Will definitely be back to try their other pizza again soon and perhaps this time I will stay instead of doing take out .. Workers seemed to be happy and atmosphere was very comfortable..."}
{"text":"My first time here, and I  had 12\" pizza pie with sausage and basil, and the spinach salad with bacon and blue cheese.   The pizza was excellent- I like thin crust and a bit of char on the edge.   The salad was one of the best I've ever had! Perfect spinach leaves, lots of bacon and cheese, and very generously sized for $9.   Daniel, working the bar seating, was great. Very friendly and competent.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, although there isn't much of a selection other than the fact that you could fully customize your own pizza. Also, the toppings were a bit pricey in my personal opinion."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to Oreganos but my bf suggested we go here instead. Place was dead, so our server was really annoying asking us if we ready to order every 2 minutes. Ordered a small pizza with red bell peppers, italian sausage, and pepperoni. Crust was really soggy first couple bites but as you eat towards the end it is so crispy and delightful. Ingredients tasted very fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizza is good but a little overpriced.  My fiancé and I ordered a 16' inch half pepperoni, half cheese. Our pizza was crispy, cheesy...and a little cold.    The service was extremely slow for a non-busy night. However, servers and hosts were very welcoming and friendly."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years and have never had bad service or bad food.  If you have young kids they bring them a small piece of dough to play with. If you want you can watch them make your pizza. All the pizzas are hand tossed it's really neat to see them toss your pizza in the air."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldis!!! Always excellent, I just wish they had roasted garlic cloves!! They have a good wine selection and service is always good."}
{"text":"I'm an east coast girl. Good pizza is hard to find in AZ. Trust me, we've searched!  Grimaldi's is delicious! It was my birthday and I'm part of their online club, so I received an email for a free large pizza. That's quite a generous gift, so I was happy to partake in it last night.   I got the white pizza, which was a first for me. I'm more of a pepperoni type usually. I had them add some bacon to it, and it didn't disappoint. Very tasty and huge! The crust is the key-and theirs held up great, which is how I appreciate a good crust. It was delicious, crispy yet just chewy enough.  Took a lot home to enjoy over the next few days. ;)  We also got the chicken Cesar salad and that was delicious too. My 10 y.o. loved it, and she's super picky.  I like diet pepsi so that was a bonus too :). It's convenient for us since we live near by and delicious too! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I. LOVE. THIS. PLACE.  My brother treated me to Grimaldi's one afternoon and it was AMAZING. We got a large pizza with ricotta, pepperoni, ham, and the red sauce. That ricotta cheese made every bite SO creamy and delicious! We ended up eating the entire thing!   We also each ordered a slice of cheesecake, I got the original new york style and my brother got the oreo. Mine was tangy and his was super chocolatey! I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This was one of the first few places I tried out via Yelp!  My parents suggested that I should check it out, too.  It is located within the San Tan Mall.  The location is great as the mall is a good place to walk off the extra mozzarella ;)  I ordered the small pizza with pepperoni and extra fresh mozzarella.  The pizza came out hot with what we ordered on top plus a couple of basil leaves.  Note:  I will not forget to add extra basil on top next time; it adds an excellent compliment to the cheese.  The extra mozzarella was probably unnecessary.  Between two people, the small was a perfect size; three slices each.  For dessert, we ordered the plain cheesecake.  The cheesecake was boring, but not terrible.  I probably wouldn't order it again.    The services was good, no complaints.  I wish they delivered.  Will definitely visit again!  My biggest takeaway from Grimaldi's is that thin-crust *is* better than thick.  I've always felt like thin crust doesn't deliver a good flavor and results in cardboard-like qualities.  Grimaldi's converted me into a thin-crust lover.  Sorry, deep dish."}
{"text":"OMG, what luck to find this place. It's as close as it could ever be to the real deal NYC pizza. Thin crispy crust that actually has flavor, not too much cheese, and the right amount of basil (I like marguerite pizza). I only wish the sauce was a 10 also. It was a wee bit on the not flavorful enough side, so I give it an 8. I will never go to Vegas again without eating Grimaldi's again. There are 2 locations. One is just outside Nordstrom, in the mall. The other is in Palazzo Hotel. I have 3 final words about this place.. IT'S A MUST."}
{"text":"Terrible pizza and way overpriced. I was excited to try this place out after reading glowing reviews, but I was extremely disappointed. The cheese and toppings had a weird rubbery texture and the crust was really chewy, taking forever to finish a bite and swallow. This restaurant has a great location and atmosphere, and the Greek salad was excellent. I'm just hoping they had a rookie baking the pizza that night and that they typically do a better job, because it was truly awful. I recommend you don't risk it and try another place."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good especially the tomato sauce that they used. However, I'm not really a fan of pizza place where you pay for each topping that you want, which can be pricey. . I prefer specialty pizza menu.  The environment is more of a family pizza place."}
{"text":"Really not a huge pizza fan until my family went here to eat one afternoon! We introduce this place to our whole family even when we have family from out of town,that is how much we love it! The pizza is not greasy at all and the pepperoni isn't spicy but it is full of flavor. We have had really bad experiences other places and just don't like to try new places anymore.When ever we get Rachel as our waitress I am excited, she is great with cutomer service and my daughter loves her and she makes sure we are satisfied each and every time we sit in her section.I also love the fact they give dough for the kiddos to play with while we wait for the food makes it fun for the kids.Make sure you sign up to be on their email list on your birthday you get a free pizza, I look forward to mine every year!"}
{"text":"Been here several times when visiting Scottsdale. They have a very solid pizza. I would say the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn was better."}
{"text":"We ordered the Antipasto salad, Margherita pizza, and the white garlic pizza with mushrooms and artichoke.   The antipasto was nothing like I've ever had before. It was literally pieces of salami, mozzarella,  tomatoes, red peppers and olives put separately on a plate and given to you. LOL NO Lettuce, nothing else. I guess I assumed the antipasto be like a chopped salad that included lettuce but it was my wrong doing for not asking first. It wasn't the best I've ever had either. The margherita pizza was a little soggy and grossed me out but I still ate it because I was starving. The white pizza was delicious. I highly recommend that. Definitely not the best pizza I've ever had, but the experience was worthwhile."}
{"text":"This was a great place for pizza!  Salads were good and pizza delish! Loved our server Saleem! He was so attentive and very friendly! Dave the manager came by to make sure we were ok and sold us on the blueberry cheesecake. Amazing!  We will be back!  Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza snob. I usually don't like gourmet pizza. I am a Ray's girl. Alas, I have been cutting most dairy out of my diet because of the harsh treatment of the animals.  Low and behold, Grimaldi's. While I will mention that the pizza I ordered totally rocked. I ordered a plain personal white with garlic (and a side of sauce). Great crust, the sauce was a little on the acidic side.  What I would like to give Grimaldi's the ultimate rating for is the fact that the mozzarella on the pizza is from happy grass-fed free-range cows. I am beyond impressed that Grimaldi's cares enough about the happiness of the cows to use a more expensive cheese.  I can eat pizza again!"}
{"text":"AWESOME! Sign up online and get a 18\" single item pizza FREE on your Bday! Love the food!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When we were out in Scottsdale last fall, we ended up eating here twice in one week at the two different locations.  The pizza was wonderful, service was great and my kids especially loved playing with the pizza dough they were given by our waitress.  We will definitely go back when we are in Scottsdale this summer."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service. They have pizza dough for kids to play with while waiting for food. The crust is what makes the pizza, perfect every time. Don't love the sauce, but the perfect crust makes up for it. Recommended!"}
{"text":"The wife and I ate at the Original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn on our honeymoon so while we were in Scottsdale we had to check this one out! And just as we hoped, it was exactly the same! Our waitress was incredible and even told us that the owners went to great lengths to have the water of this location engineered to taste just like NY! What attention to detail! The pizza is incredible and after having Grimaldi's, honestly how could you eat anything else!! Best pizza I've EVER had!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great, I love the thin crust!! The service was ok....I think our waiter forgot about our table for the end of our dinner. The only bad thing I can say is they don't have BUTTER or RANCH dressing!!! :("}
{"text":"The food is typically good at Grimaldi's but unfortunately we didn't get to find out last night because the hostess was too \"busy\" to seat us.  We were a party of 2, no one else in line, and the hostess told us she would seat us when she could.  Instead of taking 2 seconds to seat us at one of the many available tables, she continued fine-tuning a set up she was doing for a large party.  The table was already set up; however, she continued to move the tables around until they were exactly perfectly straight - then she proceeded to do the same thing with each glass and set of silverware, all the while my son and I were standing there tapping our toes waiting to be seated.  We finally gave up and walked over to Nordstrom Cafe where they were friendly and had great customer service.  It's a shame to have employees like this.  I noticed from some of the comments below that I'm not the only one that has experienced service like this at Grimaldi's at Fashion Show."}
{"text":"Great pizza!  This is my new pizza spot :-) even my lactose intolerant  husband says this pizza is well worth it! Save room for desert because it's worth it :-)"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Vegas, if not, the whole entire world. I know that's a dangerous statement to make for a chain restaurant, but I don't care! My order is typically a large white pizza with garlic (already comes with pizza), pepperoni, mushrooms and sausage. Then we get oregano, garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese on the side... and then a side of Caesar salad dressing - great for crust dipping, but I end up throwing some on my pizza as well. I'll go back and forth between the Caprese and the Caesar salad, but I think the Caprese has really good mozzarella and the tomatoes they use are really hearty. I started to get embarrassed here when the hostess kept on remembering us and always said \"welcome back\", but it's really more of a nod to their great customer service here. As of late, we've just been heading straight to the bar to be served by Erin, who is one of the friendliest and thoughtful servers/bartenders you can ask for. She even remembers our order now too, right down to the drinks, but always checks with us first just in case we want to spice things up. Reliable and delicious pizza definitely keep me coming back and hasn't left me disappointed, so I'm really afraid to venture off to the other Grimaldi's locations. We always end up bringing 4-6 slices home with us, but they are great for leftovers the next day. To reheat, we put the pizza on a non-stick pan over medium heat, cover with foil, heat for a couple of minutes or until cheese is soft, and then we once again have hot and crispy pizza ready to go. There's a special going on right now, buy a $50 gift card, get $10 gift card for yourself, buy $100, get $20. Of course, I opted for the $100 and bought it basically for myself. I just went hear a few days ago and already can't wait to go back :D"}
{"text":"After a long hot day at the ballpark, getting to the Peoria Grimaldi's was a huge priority. 2  18\" large pizza's and 2 salads were enough for 4 adults and an exhausted ballplayer.   We were told there was a 20 minute wait, but were actually seated faster. I really like any pizza with their spicy chicken sausage. And, we had 2 with Pepperoni and Spicy Chicken Sausage.   Our server was great and she stayed on top of much needed drink refills!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! Don't take hungry kids or on their birthday. Staff can careless to make your birthday boy special. Not even a smile!"}
{"text":"Wow.....This is by far the best pizza in Arizona . New York style , crust is as awesome ,  toppings are quality meats. The pizza was cooked to perfection .service was great. I'm going to be having dreams about this pizza joint."}
{"text":"Fast fun and friendly service! Food was good and very fresh! Will return without a doubt."}
{"text":"Our server, Greg, was absolutely impeccable in his service delivery and made our dining experience very enjoyable.  The manager came by a couple time during our dinner and made sure everything was stellar and it certainly was.  Grimaldi's is a solid staple in the Scottsdale dining culture and I'll be back again!  5 stars all the way :)"}
{"text":"Solid, coal-fired, East coast pizza. We ordered pepperoni for the kids,margherita  for me, and my husband ordered his own combo of ham, pepperoni, and sausage.  We also ordered a Caesar salad to share and we all loved it because the dressing wasn't overly garlicky or strong. You can add grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, or chopped pepperoni to your salad.  The only reason I gave 4 stars was because my pizza had only one little sprig of basil when most margherita pizza have fresh basil sprinkled all over the top.  Our waitress was amazing, especially since we had 18 people in our party, with three separate checks. She was on top of drink refills and bringing the pizzas out hot and quickly from the kitchen."}
{"text":"I thought the place was okay.  Neapolitan style pizza is great!  I love it because it tends to be less greasy and thinner-crusted than the average pizza.  We had the Margarita Pizza and it was good!  kids had the pepperoni pizza and they enjoyed it.  I really feel that more choices in appetizers would be great and also if there were more kid-friendly items on the menu.  Other than that, this place is great!"}
{"text":"first off, the staff here is super friendly and i would recommend anyone to this delicious pizzeria!. I ordered a pepperoni and garlic pizza and took home 2 large boxes driving back to California. Reminds me of the NYC pizzas.."}
{"text":"This had a great atmosphere.  I was intrigued by the hanging wine bottle light fixtures.  I'm tempted to try making some one day...  The menu is fairly simple, but perfect if you're looking for a salad, calzone or pizza.  We each ordered our own personal pizza.  The pizzas were thin and crispy; typical New York style pizza."}
{"text":"Returned again, bringing my NY style pizza loving bf. We got seated at a table with a fantastic window view of the Wynn. We got started with a personal size pesto pizza with meatballs and mushrooms and a small pizza with pepperoni and italian sausage. Trust me when I say the small isn't really small. Very tempted to order the pizza of the month, the prosciutto pizza, but I can't say no to pesto. Pizzas were just as good as I remembered. Our server Ty was awesome, making sure we were okay and keeping our drinks filled. I made sure to leave room for dessert, so an order for the Bailey Irish Creme Cheesecake was placed. I can't believe I didn't know they had dessert available. It's definitely not on the menu online! Very decadent and yummy!   This place is just as good as the NY original and I'm stoked they have a location in SoCal (El Segundo!). I'm also in love with their decor---empty wine bottles as hanging light fixtures? Amazing."}
{"text":"The marinara was good. The prices were bad and not a fan of piecing a pizza together from the crust on up. Need more pizza options. Rather eat CPK! It's cheaper and they have variety. Good staff though."}
{"text":"I was in NYC about a year ago and went to Lombardi's in little Italy. There I had the best pizza I have ever had. Since then I have been trying pizza everywhere I can near where I live in Southern California. I had yet to find anything good, or at least comparable to What I experienced in NYC. Enter Grimaldi's. Another coal fired oven pizza. I had hopes. It was a restaurant from the famed Grimaldis that is still sitting next the Brooklyn bridge. And guess what, this hit the mark. This is damn close to Lombardis, the second best pizza of my life, and a very close send at that. This place is amazing, great atmosphere, great food; the pizza, thin, crispy crust, sweet light sauce, fresh mozzarella, what else could you want?  Tried the Cannolis and they are not bad either. Overall, if you want a great New York Pizza without the commute f going cross country, this is it."}
{"text":"yum, cheapish food and there was absolutely no wait.   If you had east coast pizza, this place is reminiscent of it. Still, not the same for some reason... it must be the dough and the water.   4 girls got 1 large pizza and 1 large salad and it was JUST enough.   We got the greek salad and I think that was the highlight of my meal. I loved it!   Oh, do NOT NOT NOT get the dessert 10 dollar trio thing!!! It is totally not worth it.  We thought they were gonna give us a full size dessert but it was a quarter size of a real slice. Not worth it. If you are going to get dessert just share ONE cheesecake.   Don't get the cannoli, it's aiiiiight at best."}
{"text":"I am a die-hard Grimaldi's fan.  This Scottsdale location is the best one hands down.  It's Neapolitan style pizza, cooked in a coal fired oven, with fresh mozzarella sliced on it.  I've always been satisfied when I've went here.  The toppings are fresh, a bit pricey, but the pizza here isn't supposed to be loaded by design.    I always suggest getting extra cheese, because I'm a sucker for bomb fresh mozz.  The sauce is perfect as well."}
{"text":"I have a huge throbbing wood for this place...  I love their pizza and this location is on the up and up. Always order extra cheese because you cannot get enough of their fresh mozzarella... May I suggest basil and sausage too.  You really can't go wrong with this place.  I would give them 5 stars if they inserted an awesome tap into their mix.  That's about all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, pretty close in quality to Setabello. Menu has gotten a lot smaller and the price is a little on the high side for pizza. Good service and cozy environment."}
{"text":"Great food great atmosphere, friendly staff, pizza is so good, light and crusty not greasy. Their sangria is wonderful too.   my family and I come here often and we never had a bad experience ."}
{"text":"Worsttttttttt pizza experience in my life! Take \"Brooklyn\" off your box! Brooklyn pizza is good, this was a pizza fail!! Over an hour wait for burnt pizza? My full review will soon to follow!!! ----That was just the tip^^---  I was going to wait to review this place, but I can't. I'm so infuriated I could scream. We walked into Grimaldi's (Mind you, this was my very first time here) and while we were approaching the hostess, I saw her roll her eyes at my kids. LISTEN-- If you can't handle the service industry... BEAT IT! I worked every role in the restaurant business for years, including upper management. That's not how your greet guests. (Especially ones that Yelp!!) The night was NOT starting off well at all.   She asks us \"how many?\" and said that there was a 25 minute wait. That was fine for us. We told her that we didn't mind eating outside if that helped. She QUICKLY replies \"There's NO room to sit outside\".... Really? I see two open tables and a large table of 6-8 people with to-go boxes on their laps. She obviously didn't want to take another table.   Now I'm irritated. I hate liars. I hate mean people, and I hate LAZY employees!    We got sat about 10 minutes later. Our waiter, \"AJ\" was nice, he took our app and drink orders. Not to my surprise he screws that up. We ordered red sangria, he brought white. It wasn't a big deal, but I was already annoyed from all the prior attitude. We really should have left, but the kids were hungry and it's a school night.  We quickly order two pizzas and crossed our fingers that our night was about to get better.   ... Little did we know that it would get worse...  AJ, our waiter, came back a few minutes later with a red sangria in hand, apologizing for the confusion. (Ok, good work there)   After that we sat there for another hour, watching all of the tables (that arrived after us) get served their pizza! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? An hour for pizza? The waiter kept saying  that it was coming. Our kids were hungry, getting antsy and I was really annoyed.   The manager came over and said our pizza was just about up. My husband told him what happened and how we have been sitting for an hour. What did the manager reply? He said we've only been there for 25 minutes!!! HOW DARE YOU?? I said \"Really? here's my Yelp and FB check-ins showing the timestamps\"...... He knew he was caught out there and said our pizzs was next and he'd try to help work out the bill. ----GEE Thanks. You basically call my husband and I liars, make your business look horrible, then just \"try' to make up for it? I told my husband I wanted to leave. We only stayed because we were curious what was going to happen next.   Another 5-7 minutes go by, and our pizza arrives. Just ONE of them lol. I explained to the waiter that I am a Brooklyn born Italian and NO freaking pizza is worth an hour wait. He didn't really have much of a reaction.  Our second Pizza came another 2 minutes later. I take a bite... and to complete the WORST pizza story EVER.... IT WAS BURNT! Not crispy, not well done, outright pitch black burnt. It tasted like charcoal. We told the waiter we were done and over it and wanted to leave.   He brings over the bill, the manager took $33.50 off of the $95.00 bill.   We paid and left.  NEVER EVER AGAIN! First and last time.   (Burnt pizza picture was posted in my profile. YUCK)"}
{"text":"Have had NY pizza before, but this style of oven baked was definitely interesting.... okay, no....  damn good.   Definitely one of those types where you don't want to go here and fall asleep at work... type of heavy food."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Delicious pepperoni and sausage.   However, extremely inattentive service. Water left unrefilled; had to get up and sees out waiter to request bill.   A frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Awesome.  Larry, Christina and Lucas are wonderful. Tuesday for wine, the best! My goodness the pizza was so yummy. Thank you for being so close to Ahwatukee. Live it!"}
{"text":"Wow! That is probably the best pizza i have ever had ( and i am not a big pizza fan all) so i was a bit skeptical going in at first, but then i read some great reviews here on yelp and decided to give it a try. I am certainly glad i did! My husband and i ordered a small house salad. It was just ok, simple, but very fresh. Small white pizza (it was so large that i thought we should have just gotten a personal size pizza to split) with Italian sausage, mushrooms and fresh tomatoes. They make it right in front of you. The pizza came out with very thin crust, the fresh mozzarella cheese they use was amazing and probably what made the whole pizza taste as good as it did. We also ordered some white house wine ($4/glass, $9/ half carafe, which is actually pretty big) I would say this is the cheapest alcohol you can find in Vegas. Service was very good and i would definitely recommend it to anyone. The whole dinner cost us $37. Super cheap for Vegas and super good!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of pizza places in Las Vegas.  This place is the best pizza in the entire world!  At least in my opinion.  We stumbled on this place a couple years ago.  We thought, hey a pizza place to check out.  I cannot tell you how delicious the pizza tastes.  We usually order a Mediterranean salad and a small pizza with meatballs and mushrooms. Yes small because the pies are huge.  This pizza place has several locations over the united states.  They charcoal bake the pies to perfection.  The ingredients are fresh, and I mean fresh! The mozzarella is to die for. We have been to other pizza places and we always seem to compare them to this place.  You get a lot of people that say no way the pizza is better at blah blah city, but we are in Las Vegas not New York!  So what are you waiting for try this place out and if you are disappointed, then either something is seriously wrong with you or you have no pulse.  I almost forgot, get the cheese cake or the tiramisu they are awesome!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Early October 2016 0 stars for service  Ugh. The service was so bad we just left. That's right, stepped before we could even get some possibly(?) delicious pizza.  The restaurant was busier than we've ever seen. It took a long while for our server to acknowledge us and she was running like mad. Meanwhile, tables that arrived after us were starting to receive their drinks and salads, etc. Each brief, frenzied contact with our server gave the impression that we were inconveniencing her. Last straw? As we finally got ready to place our pizza order, she literally turned to another table. We literally got up and left.   No one's pizza is *that* good."}
{"text":"Wow, the bf is right, I'm hooked on Grimaldi's!  We went for dinner last night and everything was perfect, the food, weather, ambiance!  We ordered a small caesar salad to share, yes share, yes a small ($7).  A perfect portion for two.  The dressing was zesty, ample, and quite addicting.  The croutons were fresh, large, and crispy (but not jaw breaking).  The lettuce was fresh and green.  The parmesan was good but the stuff that was factory shredded, not freshly shaved.  I'm a sucker for freshly shaved parm, you know the stuff that resembles potato chips.  Regardless, the bf will be picking up a random caesar salad after work for me to chow down on.  The pizza was quite delightful!  Their crust is thin and flaky with very good flavor.  Their sauce gets two thumbs up for not being overpowering or chunky, like some of these pizza joints tend to get a little over zealous about.  And the cheese, oh the cheese...it's freshly made mozzarella!  Each pizza gets thin slices of this freshly made mozzarella!  Therefore, when your pizza is presented, it almost glows because the mozzarella is a beautifully brilliant white!  Grimaldi's uses some delicious toppings too, if you so choose to garnish your pie.  Instead of the traditional size pepperonis, they use miniature sized ones.  I think it makes the pepperoni pie easier to eat, but that's just my opinion.  The ambiance of the Eastern Ave. Grimaldi's is quite charming, even for being in a strip mall.  We here in Las Vegas are lucky to have such beautiful weather pretty much year round, therefore open air bistros like Grimaldi's are a gem on such gorgeous days/nights.  The layout of the restaurant is well-thought out.  Their bar is two-sided.  One side being for the patio, and the other side for the indoor bistro--kind of ingenious!  Let it be known, the bar does have draught beer on tap (Peroni, Blue Moon, Blue Moon Pumpkin, and a few others).  The wine menu is geared more towards everyday wines (most bottles under $50).  They have an assortment of reds, whites, blushes available by the glass and bottle.   Liquorwise, they are limited to basics, Bombay Sapphire, Three Olives Vodka, 1800, J.W. Black Label, Jack, etc.  So just remember when you order your cocktail, this is NOT an ultra lounge.  So don't be a snob just because they may not carry your favorite liquor, suck it up and try something different!  I had a blast at Grimaldi's, not because of the bottle of Riesling or bottle of Pinot Noir, but because of being surrounded by good food, good ambiance, good service, and great company!"}
{"text":"I really want to hate this place for several reasons... 1.The decor is comforting and not pretentious. 2. The service is good but, not in your face obnoxious. 3. They have a bar with a limited liqour selection and a generous wine list with plenty of by the glass or by the bottle selections. 4. Weather permitting (majority of the year), they open the doors to the bar, which transforms it into an open-air dining/bar experience. 5. The pizza is awesome!      a) Tasty, thin, chewy crust.      b) Addicting red sauce.      c) Fresh sliced mozzarella.      d) Extra toppings are delectable.      e) Perfect cheese to sauce ratio. 6. Generous salad portions, a small is enough for three.      a) Caesar salad is pretty yummy. 7. They have five convenient locations around the valley for easy access (hence we dine or do take out here about once a week).  There's just something about the pizza that makes me go WOW.  I can't put my finger on it (no pun intended) but, it drives me wild; some may even say it's better than sex. :-X  Anyway, I usually crave Grimaldi's pie at least once a week (ugh).  Since my last visit, my addiction has grown even wilder.  I normally don't stray from the usual plain and/or pepperoni pies because, a good pie doesn't need anything more.  This last visit time I tried a small \"Christmas pizza\" as the bartender called it.  A regular plain pie with pesto and pepperoni.  If you know me well, I'm a glutton, so I also ordered a large plain pie.   Holy pepperoni, the Christmas pie was stupidly awesome!  That night I restrained myself and only ate two of the Christmas slices and about four of the plain; that's how good Grimaldi's is.    Yes, I understand it is a chain restaurant but, eating at chain restaurants ensure consistency.  Consistency is something to be desired when it comes to food.  Their prices are also consistent at all of their Vegas locations:  Plain Pie small $9  medium $14 large $16 $2-5 per extra toppings To sum it all up, a nice caesar, a couple of good pies, and a decent bottle will run you about $100.  TOTALLY worth it!  So all of the above is why I hate Grimaldi's.  I'll probably go tonight :X"}
{"text":"The best pizza on earth. Athena is an amazing manager whose friendly personality and helpful recommendations made all the difference in our vacation. I go to this location every time I'm in Vegas and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Being a local to Henderson, I usually go to the Grimaldi's off of Eastern. Recently, we were at Fashion Show Mall and decided to eat at this location. The food here is always good and my wife usually gets the Mediterranean Salad, but has it tailored to how she likes it. I call it 'Stacy Style Salad' -  with no onions or olives, but with extra feta and dressing - she also requests for (2) orders of cut salami to it. Sounds a bit much, but they are always accommodating to make this, and it is pretty delicious. My son and I usually share the salad with her or get a pizza of any variety. Always good.  Why I gave this location a 5 star was because of the service that was provided to us by Javier. He is the bartender/waiter. One of the realest, sweetest human beings you'll meet. Not pretentious, his fantastic personality and always looking out for you. His likeability gave us such ease in dealing with the Christmas shopping crowd that we were dealing with outside of the restaurant. The three of us enjoyed his style and \"I got you\" demeanor so much.  We hope that he has a great Christmas cause he has made us enjoy ours.  We look forward to coming back and requesting for Javier as  our preferred server. If he isn't there and moved on, we would be totally understanding of it cause our assumption would be that he has moved on to do better things which is what we feel he deserves.  The food is great here and for any visitors coming by shouldn't be disappointed, even if it is a chain. I highly recommend this location and remember to ask for Javier!"}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic and the service was excellent. I've found my new pizza place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Free birthday pizza! I like the thin and crispy pizza crust and the sausage is great italian sausage, also they use quality cheese. The sauce was lacking so make sure you get a side of pizza sauce. Overall pretty darn good"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  First time trying Grimaldis today and WOW! I left very impressed. The service was top notch and attentive. The waiter was very patient in explaining all the different styles and options you have to choose from with the pizzas. We settled on a large with chicken and cheese on top (3 of us). The pizza had so much flavor! All 3 of us tore that pie apart in no time! It never stood a chance! ;)  Our drinks never reached the bottom before quickly being refilled. The prices were fair and definately well worth it for the product you recieved!  Only negative at all in the whole experience was that when we were finished, the server asked us twice if we wanted desert, which we politely declined. We than waited for our bill....and waited. It wasn't a \"Burger-Dog-ish\" time wait...but it was starting to become a bit frustrating until a sweet lady swooped in and sped things up a bit. By no means a deal breaker, as we will certainly be back in the near future, especially when out of town relatives are visiting!  I highly recommend Grimaldis!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  That pretty much sums up my experience tonight at this Grimaldi's location on Rainbow Blvd. It's a shame too, since I am a big fan of their pies. I have been to several of their locations and used to especially enjoy the location on Eastern/ 215.  Pros-  - The reason they are getting the 2 stars is simple. The pizza is still scrumptious! We grabbed a large 16\" pie($16) with grilled chicken(an additional $5). - I still the dig the ambiance of the place, especially the wine bottle chandeliers! That coupled with all the vintage pics of New York really creates a fun and unique atmosphere.  Cons-  - I tried not to hold this against them, but the entire time we were there, they were hosting a large and LOUD group. These people were yelling over one another and, to add to the fun, they had a gaggle of infants pitching ear piercing screams. As much as we tried to brush it off, it VERY much took away from the experience....to the point where I've never felt such a relief in leaving a restaurant!   As it relates to this, I was confused because this large group was placed right in the front of the restaurant, while a large room with about a dozen tables and sliding doors sat there unused. Would it not have made sense to place this group in this area where they could enjoy themselves and been a lot less disruptive?? This is something I CAN hold against them! - Our server wasn't terrible, but he seemed pretty annoyed....and it showed. We felt like he just kind of \"mailed it in\". He didn't even offer to refill our beverages and I had to wave him down to get my drink replenished. It could have been and should have been much better. - When we asked about pineapple for a topping, our waiter responded,\" No pineapple. No wi-fi. No ranch.\" Wow. lol Ok.  By the end of the meal, we could not WAIT to get the eff out of there. We both made the remark that we should have just stuck to Rosati's since it is much closer to home.  In summary, I still love Grimaldi's and I still love their pies, but I will drive the extra miles to go back to the Eastern restaurant and avoid ever coming back to this location.  Disappointing. Underwhelming. A complete letdown.  2 stars."}
{"text":"While in the Palazzo to see Panda!, we decided to try this Grimaldi's. We live right around the corner from the one on Eastern and love that location, so we figured it'd be a safe bet with a different location.  I think what was most surprising about our visit here was that the prices on the menu were identical to the one on Eastern! Wow!No Mark up for being on the strip?? That's a refreshing change!  As usual, the food was excellent! We ordered a large pie with grilled chicken, italian sausage, and pepperoni. YUM! It was just as good as the location on Eastern!   I think the biggest difference we noticed between here and the Eastern location and this spot was the service. Don't get me wrong, the service at Eastern is great...but the service here was exemplary! Just about as good as it gets! I believe our servers name was JP and he was great!  In fact we were so impressed with our experience here, we decided that we will make the extra effort and drive to come to this location in the future! Great service, great food, with great ambiance!   So this seems like a foregone conclusion, but I have to give it..  5 stars! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I HATE PIZZA!!  By that I mean I hate Domino's, Papa John, Pizza Hut, all of those delivery garbage places.  Their crust is soggy, toppings stale, and no, no, no flavor.  GRIMALDI'S ROCKS, which is on the opposite end of all of those worthless places on TV.  The crust is crispy, and crooked, and uneven, and just absolutely delicious alone.  The sauce is not too sour/sweet, just tastes of fresh tomatoes and herbs.  The combination of cheese and fresh sauce, with that crispy smoky crust just makes this place the best pizza period.  I had it at the OG Brooklyn bridge location and also drove 30 minutes from the Strip in Vegas.  BOTH places are equally good, and yes, Vegas, Brooklyn, or any other city where they open a franchise, I will be there.  I LOVE GRIMALDI's!!!!"}
{"text":"So came here for lunch and it hurts me to give this place one start. It was not that busy took forever to get our pizza. Came here with another couple they got their pizza and 15 minutes later ours comes out wrong size and Burnt. They said sorry for the wrong size and a large will be coming out shortly. Well another 10 minutes later the pizza comes out. By this time I am ready to go. The waitress brings out the bill and takes another 10 Minutes to come out.  If the service like this continues I will not be back."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's doesn't make the absolute BEST pizza in town, but it definitely is good. The ambiance and overall vibe of the place works really well. It's elegant, but casual. The food speaks for itself: come here to eat some pizza, not to be seen.   Grimaldi's offers a surprisingly nice wine menu focusing on Italian (or Italian style) reds. I had a personal favorite, Coppola Claret with an italian sausage/sweet roasted pepper pizza and was in love. Another great \"pizza wine\" they offer is the Antinori Santa Cristina Sangiovese. Delicious. We had dessert as well, which was pretty good. The tiramisu my friend had was great. Pair it with a glass of Rosa Regale with it. It's... sexual.   Most of the time that I've eaten here has been work-related wine tastings, but the service has always been attentive and prompt. Grimaldi's fills a nice niche in OTS of being an upscale, yet casual and uncomplicated pizza place."}
{"text":"Niiiiiice pie and good beer on tap --attentive and friendly staff. Place was a-buzz so I had to eat at the bar. The small pie is plenty for even a big appetite like mine --no need for medium or appetizers.  Would def go back or try other locations."}
{"text":"Good, solid pizza place. Good prices and very good menu variety. Service was great, and the food was pretty good. I was expecting a bit more from the pizza. I wanted it to be a little more crispy, and have the \"taste\" of the coal oven. The flavors were good and I could tell everything was super fresh. The sauce was my favorite. Soooo good."}
{"text":"Grimaldis pizza will never let you down. You can create ur own in which I recommend mushroom and sausage!"}
{"text":"When you order a personal pizza, two people can share! It's huge haha. I ordered the brooklyn bridge ( I believe that's the name) and that was topped with ricotta cheese, Italian sausage and peppers. I don't eat pizza often but I liked it because it felt like a crossbreed between a pizza and a lasagna. The waiter that served our table was very pleasant!"}
{"text":"I always and looking for a good place to have pizza.  After a movie at camelview, we stopped into Grimaldi's based on a friends recommendation.  We had a large pizza with pepperoni.  I have to say, it was the most delicious tasting pizza I have had in a long time.  The crust is absolutely perfect.  It is thin crust, and maybe the best I have had.  The crust has a savory tast - I believe it is basted with butter and garlic, but the flavor is mouth watering.  The sauce is tomato based, and flavorful - not spicy, but has a great taste.  The cheese was also perfect - mozzerella along with the fresh pepperoni is a simple yet great combo.  The server was friendly, and very helpful in explaining the menu.  The prices are a little high - if all you are used to is calling in a pizza from dominos.... but if you want  a high quality, mouth watering pizza, try Grimaldi's.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pesto Pizza with Fresh Mozzarella....DROOOOL....nuff said!"}
{"text":"We went there last night, and enjoyed it, we order a bruschetta pizza and a veggie one. both were good, the service was good as well. We ordered 2 large pizzas, for 5 people, and everyone left full."}
{"text":"I've been having a torrid love affair with Grimaldi's.    Where I work, there's a little deli downstairs.  I eat there pretty much everyday.  The food there isn't great, but it's right down stairs and I feel at home there and they have soup and salad and stuff.  My little office deli has been closed for the holidays.  I am a creature of habit, so I've been having to venture off to fend for myself food-wise.  I felt like pizza--I was hungover, mind you--so I used Yelp to find something.  I typed in my zip code and \"pizza\" and Grimaldi's popped up.  When I was ordering, in a groggy voice, with a headache, I think the phone conversation went like this:  \"Grimaldi's, how can I help you?\"  \"Yeah,\"  I said.  \"Do you guys deliver?\"  \"No, we don't.\"  \"Shit.  Um,\"  I googled them and saw they were like a three minute bike ride away.  \"I'd like to put in an order for pick-up then.\"  They asked me what I wanted on my pizza and I went with the usual sleazy choices.  They told me they didn't have canadian bacon.  I was like, what the fuck?  I asked if I could get bread sticks.  No bread sticks.  I was like, fine.  Just the pizza, then.  When I rode my bike there, I realized, \"Oooohhhhh, this is a fancy place.  I had no idea.\"  I'm a dirtbag, so, to me this place is pretty much like my idea of upscale.  I rode my bike back to work with one hand, the other hand on my pizza.  When I got out of the elevator, these people were like, \"Grimaldi's?  Mmmmm!\"  I finally dug in.  It was delicious.  Seriously.  I can't imagine pizza tasting much better.  If pizza were better, my taste buds would react in a confused manner and I think the result would be a negative experience.  This is a delicate balancing act of being delicious without creating a transcendant experience into a foody hell.  I thought the pizza was overpriced until I tried it.  I ate the whole pizza by myself at work.  I ate Grimaldi's and, since it was super slow that day, I watched The God's Must be Crazy.  Easily, one of the best workdays I've ever had.  Since then, I've been there to eat another pizza and a huge, baby-sized calzone.  This is a great place.  The help is always nice to me, even though everyone's dressed nice and I come in all red-faced and sweaty after locking my bike up to a street sign since I was not able to find a bike rack."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday exactly 4 pm and was told that they basically don't serve pizza until 5:15!? Myself and the group behind us walked out. Who the fuck doesn't serve food at 4 pm on a Saturday?"}
{"text":"I may have found my new favorite pizza place in AZ!  I grew up eating NY slices and have yet found pizza that makes my taste buds dance.  GRIMALDI's has it!  Additionally, they gave us $5 off just because we had never been there before.    Great customer service + Great Food = I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped Again at 2pm. Hungry Hungry for Pizza. I did not think they were that busy. But today Very Slow or Understaffed. Our server \"Ellie\" was server, bartender, and looked like she was All Over For Everything. We always share small salad-that big. When pizzas finally came- that made up for slowness.  One of best pizza yet. They cooked a little longer and crust was nice golden brown and crispy. Perfect. Just felt sorry for Ellie."}
{"text":"we stop for a great pizza. day before new years our waiter Lori was too busy but still very attentive. Pizza was best yet. thin crust, baked perfect, crust tender and fresh. Best Pizza In Arizona.  Thats why we always go back. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"Perfect salad. Perfect Pizza. This Grimaldi's is #1. Against the others. Chandler is now #2.  Servers fast and pleasant-Ana-very good. Crust done but not too much. Sauce is Great, enough sothat some drips out. Pizza is to be eaten by folding. Saw several eat with knife and fork-like Mike Greenburg-  not cool."}
{"text":"So. Slow. Our waitress came to the table exactly once for us to order and then disappeared. The wait has been 35 min and counting with nothing... Finally saw her again with our order after 39 minutes. Pizza is ok. Nothing amazing."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great service.   I came here with a few friends and this was the first time any of us has every been to any of the Grimaldi's locations. The menu looked pretty small at first, but it just has everything you could possibly need/want here. We went with a large house salad: Romaine lettuce, red onions, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, olives, and Vinaigrette dressing ($8), a large white w/ garlic pizza with meatballs and mushrooms ($22), and two Cannolis ($4.50 ea.).   The salad came out in a bowl that was just big enough to fit the portion of salad in it, so it looked like there wasn't much salad at first, but there was actually more than enough for all four of us. I guess I'm just so used to places putting salad in oversized bowls that I don't realize what the \"right\" amount looks like. We each had at least 2 servings each and there was still some leftover. The salad was very fresh and I really enjoyed the mushrooms and Vinaigrette dressing. It's not too often that I have salad with mushrooms in it. The pizza blew all of us away. The crust was very thin, but not dry or overcooked. There were also a lot of garlic bits on top, but it surprisingly didn't bother any of us. It also had a pretty good amount of mushrooms on top, which I loved.  Our waitress was always checking up on us and refilling our drinks throughout our time here and she would even give her recommendations, tell us a little bit about the different menu items, and even joke around a little. It really added to our experience here.  Tip *Sign up for their birthday promo. You get a free large pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza does not get any better than this!!!  Love everything about this place. Atmosphere, caesar salad, pizza, and the desserts are so delicious!  Wish there was one closer to me.  Every time I am near Scottsdale we stop for pizza no matter who is with us!"}
{"text":"Pizza, great. Calzone, great. Service, great. Prices, high.   I guess you get what you pay for but for those kind of prices I might think of ordering an inferior product to save $20. Not that I wouldn't go back. They definitely know how to make and excellent pie..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Simple menu. Ultra tasty pizza. Super fresh ingredients and toppings. Crust is authentic thin crust. I've had pizza all over the world and many times in Naples, Italy. This isn't far off. Grimaldi's rocks!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite pizza in town.  I was even blessed to try their original New York location (though the dough their is even more thin, like a cracker).  This pizza is best enjoyed right out of the oven.  Yes, they offer take out, but don't do it!  If they cook it right (you have to ask for well done) it's perfect.  I love that it's not greasy shredded mozzarella, but fresh mozzarella.  Try it sprinkled with garlic powder!   The only thing I can say that is missing is a hot appetizer.  If they offered calamari or something, I would truly be in heaven.  Tuesday is half off wine night (if I'm not mistaken!).  Amen for that!"}
{"text":"This is a great pizza place. The pizza is brick oven baked and that really makes a huge difference pizza taste way better when it's brick oven baked. We got a small pepperoni and it was big enough for two people. It was really good the pepperoni was a little spicy not hot just had a kick to it and it was very delicious. The place is always supper busy so we just took the pizza to go."}
{"text":"Not too impressed... I don't get the infatuation... Service was ok, pizza kinda tasted like card board and there wasn't enough cheese on the pizza. I wouldn't come back... Onto find my favorite pizza place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow this place has very bad service.   Stopped in for a personal size pizza had 45 min before movie starts next door.  Seated no more then 20 feet from the pizza station.  After 30 min the server comes by and says they are still woking on it.  15 min latter we walked out with nothing.  This was the  only time we talked to the server and the Manager never came over, even though he could see us seating there bored to death, to explain why they are inept.   Had more conversation with the bus boy as he pickup around us.  Really how long does it take to bake  a 12\" pizza 5 -8 min. Never again, has been 3 years since I was there before and it was so-so then, so it's not gotten better.  Fool me once good for you, fool me twice shame on me."}
{"text":"It's just good.  Quality ingredients do make some tasty pizzas.  I recently discovered Grimaldi's and I think it's about to become one of my go-to dinner destinations.  It's a bit on the pricey side for the pie - it's not the place if you're looking for a cheap date - but when you're in the mood to gab with your friends over wine, beer, salads, and thin crust pizza, check this place out.  The salads are meant to be shared.  I like the feel of that.  I do love a good salad, but the pizza is what drew me back after my first visit.  The crust is nice and thin, with a slight chewy bite.  It's often a little charred around the edges, which I adore.  The cheese is thinly sliced fresh mozzarella.  It's subtle, with a hint of sweet, and even though mozz generally lacks flavor, there is something about this chewy white melty cheesy goodness that makes me say \"mmm\".  I really like how they smoosh up the Kalamata olives so that the little crushed pieces are splattered all over the pizza.  Plus, they feature some local brews.  I enjoyed my pie with a Tenaya nut brown tonight.  Yay for supporting locals!  I think the biggest drawback is the lack of price breaks for topping combos.  Four toppings can cost you the price of the base pie, yowzahs.  At this Eastern Ave location there is some lovely outdoor seating (although I can think of better ambiance than Eastern Ave, but you can only ask for so much here in Hendertucky), and I find the indoor ambiance rather pleasant.  I've experienced nothing but friendly service.  It's a great place to grab a bite and a drink with a friend, and you'll leave with satisfied tastebuds and your stomach not overflowing with grease."}
{"text":"Had to write a review because the customer service was so amazing.  I ordered ricotta cheese on my pizza, but when the server brought our food, lo and behold, no ricotta. I explained the situation to the server (no big deal, just didn't want to be charged for a topping I didn't get) and he immediately apologized and offered to fix my pizza. He came back about 10 seconds later and said he would just give me a new pizza with my correct order. Then, the manager came over, apologized profusely and confirmed that I would be getting a free pizza. On top of everything else, they discounted my bill by half. So, I got twice the pizza for half the price over a very minor mistake!  Best customer service ever!"}
{"text":"I've been to this pizza joint a few times now. I've been to a few of their locations. They are all pretty damn good. Their Pizza is one of the best pizzas around period.  Salads are good and so is the desert. They have some coconut cheesecake that is amazing.   The ingredients are very fresh and there's plenty of toppings on the pizza. The crust has a nice texture on the inside and crunchy on the ends.   The only downsides are that it gets kind of busy and the waiters end up running around quite a bit. So you're attention from them is diminished. Also the pizza is also kind of pricey.   Give them a shot, they make a great pie!"}
{"text":"Been going to this location since it opened. I've seen lots and lots of turnover. Service though is typically great. This time seems to be an exception. We were seated pretty quickly. Our waitress came to our table about 5 minutes after being seated, not too bad. We ordered immediately since knew what we wanted. Our salad took about 20 minutes to arrive. Our pizza about 30 minutes after that. To me this is too long to wait. Our waitress, would ask in passing if we were still okay. At this point we were annoyed. We've never waited that long for our food to come out here. She never apologized and gave no explanation. When she handed us our bill it wasn't even the correct one. We almost thought our pizza was comped due to the wait. But no it just belonged to another table completely. When we told her it was incorrect she seemed pretty annoyed. Needless to say, Grimaldi's today you failed. Thanks for great tasting pizza and shitty service!"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes!! Anytime I'm in Vegas, I will stop at Grimaldi's!  I came here based off pictures I saw my friend post of her meal. It looked yummy and I can tell you that it definitely is!! My hubby and my two little kids ate lunch here and thoroughly enjoyed it! We ordered a Small pizza with pepperoni, fresh garlic and fresh basil leaves...and them devoured it. The crust is crispy and delicious and the toppings are fresh.  You can order toppings to be different on each quarter if you really wanted to try lots of toppings...but they charge regular price even if you are not getting it on the whole pizza, FYI.  We also ordered a small house salad, which had a really yummy vinegarette  dressing.  Our waitress was super nice. I think her name was Amy...Angie...?  Like I said, anytime I'm in Vegas I will be stopping by!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is decent pizza. I was there with my family dining out al fresco one evening and they forgot to make our pizza because they were too busy concentrating on the catered event in the banquet dining area. When our pizza did arrive, it was the wrong pizza. So they finally did get it right and have gotten it right with each subsequent visit.  I like their thin crust pizza and it's definitely worth ordering. I have to laugh sometimes when I run into the New Yorkers that have a major chubby about this place.  It's rather entertaining but I would still recommend this place when you're in old town Scottsdale and are jonesing for a pizza."}
{"text":"All I have to say this place was so amazing we had to eat here 2 days in a row.  Great service!"}
{"text":"I was very dissapointed in this Grimaldi's location when it came to accommodating my large party. When I called ahead they refused to reserve or hold any seating for my party of 9 couples- even when I explained that we were happy to split the party. Because we had agreed with our group to meet at that location, I asked if I sent my husband ahead to put our name in would that be okay. We were told yes and that's what we did. When my husband arrived an hour before we were hoping to eat and explained the situation the waitress swore at him. He says he felt like he was on the set of \"Mean Girls\" as the hostesses reported to an equally unprofessional and unhelpful manager. We ended up leaving and redirected our group to a very accommodating resturaunt in the same vicinity. Terrible experience overall, very disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a very cozy place, nice atmosphere. I was a bit sticker shocked at the prices for their pizzas. My wife and I ordered a 12\" gluten free pizza crust with pepperoni, bacon, ham. I usually don't care for gluten free crusts, they are usually stale and bit like cardboard compared to regular pizza crust. We were amazed at how flavorful and authentic everything was. You would have never known what crust you were eating, it was smokey, garlic butter herb taste. The mozzarella is so freaking fresh, with thick slices of meat. Everyone at the table was very impressed, my father in law, who's from Queens NY, loved it. Said it reminded of the pizza he grew up on. In fact they import water from the east coast to give its distinct flavors. The sticker shock whisked away after the first slice. I don't remember if I have had pizza as good as this. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Back again for another great meal.  Service is exceptional tonight.  Fresh salad with a large pizza,  can't forget the anchovies to add that additional flavor."}
{"text":"This is my brothers favorite pizza place. Make sure you know what kind of pizza you like before you order. I it's crispy which I love but others hate."}
{"text":"I've been to the Eastern/Green Valley and Summerlin location several times. I love the pizza and salads and wine selection. Food was great tonight! The hostess was amazing! She remembered my name up until the moment we walked out (impressive). Typically, service is decent. However, after tonight, I feel compelled to write this review. Our waitress was Stephanie. She started out good, chatted with us about opening the bottle of wine, then when she was done, I asked her to bring us some silverware. She never did remember to bring the silverware. I had to get up and go to the hostess stand, after the salad arrived, to get my own. Then when the pizza came, she took my dirty plate but took a while to come back with the new plate. After finishing my first piece without a plate, we had to flag her down to get the plate (she forgot that too). At one point, she asked, \"did they ever offer you oregano or garlic\"? We were thinking, 'who are THEY, isn't she our server'? When we answered, \"no,\" she never did ask if we'd like some, then turned and walked away. She also never refilled the water.  We completed a comment card and took it to the hostess stand and asked that it be delivered to the manager. We saw our waitress run over to read it, along with the rest of the girls at the hostess stand.  Will I go back again: Yes! I do love the food. I'm hoping; however, that service gets better. Being in the Las Vegas area, there is a lot of competition, so one would think attention to detail is important."}
{"text":"I have been a fan for years.  For authentic, fresh, delicious, New York style pizza there is nothing better in the valley. They are expensive but you do get what you pay for. I love that they use fresh mozzarella on all their pies. Service has always been good and fast.  What's not to like?  They do have some killer pesto sauce that I highly recommend. We usually order the pesto pizza with artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes, olives, and occas chicken. We also have them add some red sauce on top. Soooooo good."}
{"text":"Holy mother of goodness.  The smell, the location, the ambiance are all cool, but the food is delicious and brings you back for more.  Quite possibly the 2nd best pizza I have ever had.    I picked it last Friday as take out and drove the few blocks to my hotel and it was piping hot on arrival.  I am plotting on when to try it again."}
{"text":"We had the garlic white pizza and a pepperoni calzone. The pizza was thin crust, somewhat crunchy, and had lots of garlic. It was very good, I liked the crust and the cheese. Very tasty. The amount of garlic was a little much for me but great for my wife. I don't really like having to taste garlic in my mouth for the next four hours, even after brushing. But I still might order it again. The calzone was great! I have never had a calzone I liked until this one. Most are made of way to much undercooked dough. This one was perfect and very tasty."}
{"text":"First time trying this pizza place inside palazzo.  It is actually pretty good!   We got a small pesto pizza (16inch) with pepperoni and sausage for $20 enough for the 3 of us to share.  The 18 inch is only $2 more but we don't want to have any leftover since we are staying at a hotel.   Service was ok...I did not expect much since it is only a pizza lunch."}
{"text":"Best pizza I  had West side of Las Vegas with thin crust.House Salad was one of my favorite with little tang in it.Service was good. I'll be back for  pizza again, as many times we being there and alway been great tasting."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first Grimaldi's experience and all I can say is....simply amazing. We don't have them in San Diego just yet(although I was assured by our waiter Brian we shall soon). It was love at first bite. Very tasty pizza! We decided on pepperoni and bacon. If you haven't been before I would recommend that simple but delicious combination! The crust was crispy yet chewy and soft inside. Also the sizes here run large so a small easily feeds two very generously. This won't be last visit!   Ps)a little Tabasco sauce on it never hurts!"}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but WAY overpriced.  They start with a basic pizza then toppings are extra.  $2 for jalapenos? $2 for onions?  Seriously?"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, pizza, salad & wine!  No need to review if you've been to one Grimaldi's their all very similar.  Thin crust quality toppings and fresh salads.  I enjoy them, but I know it's going to cost me. They think highly of their food."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed splitting a small house salad and a small pizza today! Great amount to share for lunch WITH left overs.    Started with the House Salad that has roasted red bell peppers, fresh mushrooms, cherry tomatoes,  crisp lettuce and tossed with a tasty Italian vinaigrette.  Followed up with the \"Personal Pizza\" a 9 \" topped with veggies, Grimaldi's delicious sauce and just the right amount of cheese for a crunchy thin crusted pizza.  Is your mouth watering yet?    Doesn't break the bank and great service to boot!"}
{"text":"Simply the best- what else is there to say. I'm Originally from New Jersey - many years ago I might add but this is really the best in Vegas. I do know good pizza. All of the other grimaldis around town are pretty much identical in quality so you can't go wrong with any of them."}
{"text":"Wow, the pizza here was great. And I've been to Mozza. I'm not comparing it to Mozza, I'm just saying, the pizza was yummy.  This is a family place and very loud, but the food is good and everyone is happy. There is a good selection of wine and beers and a full bar. We started with the mediterranean salad which was fresh and flavorful, unlike a lot of pizzeria salads which are an afterthought at best.  We had four different pizzas, two white sauce and two red sauce. I had extra red sauce, pepperoni, and artichoke hearts. One of the best pizzas I've had. Soft in the middle and crispy at the edges, but not so crispy that it was hard to eat and made a mess. Not at all greasy. All the toppings were fresh and the sauce was tangy and not too sweet. The two white pizzas were also good, but I definitely prefer red.  There is a large array of toppings and I wanted to try them all. You can also do half/half of different sauces which is a great way to try different things. My mouth is watering thinking about it. I really wish there was a Grimaldi's in LA!  Hint: We went across the street for ice cream afterward to a kitschy sundae place and it was great!"}
{"text":"Supposedly considered to be the best pizza in all of NY. So I guess I came in with really high hopes. Went with a bunch of yelp elites after a long weekend of partying hard in Vegas. So this was our last meal before LA and we were quite excited.   Weird location being in a mall, though you wouldnt notice until you walk outside. We ordered 3 large Pizzas. Pesto, White (garlic and cheese) and sausage and pepperoni  (cuz Dre hate veggie pizza).   Service was slowwwww. In fact they messed up our order, however they were extremely courteous about it that we got the original order as well as 2 small ones and 1 extra large for a total of 6 Pizzas!   Pizza was pretty good, I wouldnt say the best but still good and the fact they gave us extra helps. My favorite of the three was the white and the sausage and pepperoni. Crust is thin and foldable, new york style."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and I go to Vegas a few times a year. Every trip I make, I make sure I stop by here atleast once!  My cousin brought me here once and I've been going ever since! I LOVE pizza and am very picky when it comes to eating pizza.  what I love about Grimaldi's is you can order a simple pizza and it'll come out great and full of flavor!  Definitely worth trying if you're into pizza...and if you're not!"}
{"text":"Food and service is usually great however today our waiter was rotten . First he got our tea order wrong , then he brought one small pizza and forgot my order . I had to wait another 20 min just to flag him down . And lastly , he never asked if we wanted refills etc. he's lucky I still left a 15% tip. Ohhhh, no soap in woman's bathroom !!!! How unclean is this ? How are employees washing their hands?"}
{"text":"I have been a lover of Grimaldi's since I lived in New York and love it here in Vegas just as much. Admittedly, the dough isn't as good as it is in Nyc or Brooklyn due to the water probably but the overall flavor is the same. They give you tons of topping, and offer more upscale ambiance than their super low key vibe in New York locations.   Their desserts are also amazing if you still have stomach for it afterwards. I highly recommend their New York Cheesecake. That would make your day for sure."}
{"text":"We haven't been to Grimaldi's in quite some time because we've been practicing a GF diet. We decided to rough it with our two little guys (5 and 18 mos) tonight and it happened to be the time when they were stoking (#wtfisthat #crapanextrawait). We ended up not only getting our pizza quickly, but also had an amazing server, and \"Steve\" (manager?) came by and noticed our little guy was struggling with his pizza... He brought him out something special which really helped make the dinner more amazing.  Food, server, atmosphere, and a little extra = thank you for not kicking myself for bringing the kids (lots of restaurants, few babysitters). We remember why we used to love you!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent but if your bartender can't keep up at 3 o'clock in the afternoon you need to hire a new one"}
{"text":"If you like thin crust Pizza Grimaldi's is the place for you. The Staff is very nice and the PIZZA is GOOD! Best of all yesterday when I was there half off the wine. The salads are also very tasty a small salad is plenty for two people. My favorite pizza is the meatball and ricotta yum. The manger Tim was very attentive as well. Check it out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"By far some of the best pizza I've had in a very long time. We got the pepperoni and garlic with red sauce. Doesn't sound like much but it was phenomenal. The taste was undeniably good. Sometimes less is more. They cook their pizzas in a coal fired oven which gives them that extra flavor other places lack. Definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is probably the best sit down pizza around.  They use great ingredients, and their wine list is solid...it all makes for a good time and great oldies."}
{"text":"we like coming here.great spicy sausage pizza and spinach salad.atmosphere is very nice.good happy hour on wine and beer.plus we had a great bartender and server Kurt."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is 99% guaranteed to be the best pizza on the strip. If you like deep-dish Chicago-style pizza with a lot of cheese then this is a spot for you! But you should have some time before you go because if you order a large pizza it's going to take at least an hour. Yes at least an hour to cook your food and that probably goes without saying depending on the amount of people that are there. But if you have some time and you're willing to get some dinner and a drink that stuff in the spot to go to whether you are a local like me or just visiting"}
{"text":"A chain pizza place that can actually deliver, no pun intended.   I have driven past this place a million times, but never ventured in because there are plenty of places to eat on Eastern Avenue without hitting up a cross country pizza chain. When in Henderson, on a Friday night, after eleven, the pickin's are slim and I was tired. I was \"pizza chained\" into submission.   I came in, bellied up to the bar, and ordered a Goose Island and Caesar salad. While perusing the menu for pizza options my salad quickly came and it was good. I mean it's a Caesar salad, with fresh lettuce and solid dressing. You really have to try hard to mess up a Caesar salad.   I ordered a personal pizza (12in) with ricotta, sausage, basil, black olives, with a pesto drizzle. This pizza was very good and also came out fast and fresh. The crust was crispy and the ricotta was the perfect addition to the marinara and pesto collaboration. This was plenty of pizza for one person and the perfect sharing size.   I like the fact that I can build my own pie and the process was mostly painless. Good pizza, not amazing, but I would come back for the service and the beer selection. Grimaldi's had done its job, I had a full belly, light buzz, and was ready for bed!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and always forget to review. I like to get a large pepperoni and meatball pizza and have them mix the tomato sauce with the pesto sauce. It's beyond delicious. I've also gotten a chicken pizza with their Alfredo sauce and it's just as delicious! This is definitely one of my favorite pizza spots in Vegas. Not too many can compare to it. Be careful during the dinner rush because it can get busy but usually I get in within 15-20 minutes. Also if you go on a nice day ask to be seated on their outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Celebrated my daughters last minute 7th bday and requested the patio for our party. They were able to accommodate us and gave us an awesome server (Devon)  of course the pizza is a hit with the kids and adults."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza with an affordable price, that I've had in Vegas. Oh and the staff was on point with their customer service   Pepperoni and cheese pizza yUmmy!"}
{"text":"We love Grimaldis. Been here lots of times. The pizza is very good and service is usually good too. On our last visit I felt things were off. We got a Greek salad and it was very heavy on the vinegar. I almost couldn't eat it. We asked for pesto and red sauce on one pizza and it came out with only pesto. Also, the crust was a bit burnt in places and left a bad taste in my mouth. Disappointed, but still had a nice time with family. Atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Some might say pizza is the best gift from Italy... according to me.  Grimalid's makes some good pizza.. i love pizza restaurants that let you customize your flavors and toppings and grimaldi's does it right.  i am a meat eater so of course i added meatballs.. jalapenos are good if you love the spice and kick..   next time i will be more adventurous and try the other sauce bases and get crazy!. their house wine is a good price and tastes delicious"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite non-cibo pizza in town, for me it doesn't get much better then here. i normally get the meaty type pizza with extra basil on the side uncooked and the pizza always comes out so juicy (you wouldn't think of this as a good word to describe pizza but it is) and tasty."}
{"text":"The spinach salad was really good flavor and crisp bacon. Very tasty gluten free crust. Sauce and cheese perfectly portioned. Sad they didn't have pineapple for a topping but My dining partner told that's gross anyway. LOL. It was a really good and I would totally eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to say it and I say it proudly... Grimaldi's pizza is the best pizza I've ever had up till now... it's ruined other pizza for me.  Staying at the Palazzo I noticed the advertisement billboard for it in the elevator lobby and didn't think much of it until we had our family over the hotel visiting and instead of eating out we decided to order to go and eat in our Bella Suite.  I have no idea what the pizzeria looks like and really don't care because on taste alone, it can be cooked on a cookie sheet and a lighter as long as it tasted that good.  I couldn't place what kind of cheese was used but I think it was manchego cheese along with the pepperoni and oh the spice, the spices just made for the best slice of pizza I've ever had.     I can't wait to return to Vegas just to have the pizza, this time I will eat at the pizzeria."}
{"text":"We have a Grimaldi's Pizzeria here in Tucson and this one is much larger then ours.  It was nice to sit and not be sitting so close to another table.  We had a great pizza with plenty of left overs and great service."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've had outside of Italy. Great thin crust pizza pies made fresh with great ingredients what more could you ask for. They have real coal brick ovens which give the pizza that nice char and flavor you can't get at other places. Of all the Grimaldi/Patsy Grimaldi's locations in Arizona I think I like this one in Old Town the best just because of the environment and the fact its in Old Town Scottsdale. If you want great pizza I highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. The coal brick oven gives the pizza a great taste!"}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's pizza, and this location is no exception. I live in Tucson and our one location closed, so if I have an opportunity to eat at Grimaldi's when in Phoenix, I seize it! It was super busy on a Saturday early evening, but I was able to get a seat at the bar. The bartender was very efficient and kind. I ordered the kale salad, which was really good. Typically, you can split the salads, even the small size, but I ate it all because I was ravenous.  I took my pie to go. Despite it being busy, the service was still on point, and I didn't wait too long for my food. The bartender kept on top of drink refills as well. If you don't sign up for their emails, you're a fool! On your birthday, they send you a coupon for a free one-topping large pizza, which is a savings of $20 or so."}
{"text":"Lets start with the best part of their pizza, the marinara sauce. Very good! Too bad it ends there. The crust has no flavor. The entire pizza is just bland. This is not the same name from NY! The chain is nothing like the original. Boring."}
{"text":"So very disappointed. Went here a week ago and it was delicious. Decided we would get Togo since we were tired from the day driving home and had baby in tow. Was told order would be ready in about 35 minutes got there in 30 and was told it still had another 20 to go. So frustrated went back to the car to wait since the inside was so hot. After 20 minutes went back and was told another 10 more minutes of course furious at this time another 15 minutes later of course baby and husband waiting in the car the entire time our one pizza comes out and says it's going to be a couple more for the other. 5 more minutes go by and the lady comes up and says they dropped our pizza on the ground. UNBELIEVABLE. So so frustrated and angry she says she will credit my acct which I will follow up with and make sure it gets done but so angry and not sure if I will be going back. Total time 70 minutes wasted when told 35 min and a quarter tank of gas. RIDICULOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza place.  I like the thin crust but must warn you that if you order for pick up by the time you make it home it will be cold and soggy.  I had it there and enjoyed it freshly out of the oven.  The place is very nice and always busy."}
{"text":"Summary: True NY style pizza, crispy and holds up to the old NYC pizza test: \"hold slice with one hand and if it does not slump over or require a second hand than the crust was created and cooked perfectly!\"  In depth: being from NY the lady and myself are slight pizza snobs. Grimaldi's on Eastern has always delivered a solid pie that reminds us of back home. See people complaining about the crust and I think they are simply uneducated. The crisp and darkened crust is the way this \"coal oven\" pie is served. That coal oven taste is transferred into the crust and gives it amazing consistency and flavor. This is not the Albanian owned knock off pizza parlors that most Vegas locals have grown accustomed to eating.   I like to add the Ricotta Cheese, fresh tomatoes and sausage to my pie. I also like artichokes and think they make a decent topping along with olives.   The Caprese salad here is the bomb. I like to add salami for an additional $2 more (see my pics).   I only removed a star for two reasons: 1) the cost seems a little too high for pizza. It tastes good and I am a customer, I only feel like we would go more if it was priced appropriately. 2) service can be spotty when you eat in. Had to get up and track down our waitress last night to take our order.   Lastly, Grimadi's makes for great left over cold pizza. Make sure you take a couple slices home for cold pizza breakfast the next day!"}
{"text":"Ah, finally a place I can write a good review about.  Saturday night and the place is packed. Lucky I made a reservation, others had to wait 20-30 minutes as there were private parties, families couples and groups of folks everywhere...and the place is pretty big. Plenty of staff to serve everyone and we were quickly seated. Ordered the house salad and a couple of personal sized pizzas. The salad arrived quickly and one small took care of two of us. There was one guy tossing the pizza dough and he was putting on quite a show, although not sure I would want the pizza where he ran the dough across his back, that shirt was a bit sweaty. But, he was talented  that is for sure. Pizza arrived and it was very good, New York style  thin crust. Cheese was fresh and excellent, good sauce, crust while the bottom was crisp and the edges done well, there was still a thin layer of soggy between the toppings and the bottom. Maybe that is just the way a brick oven cooks. Overall a superior product that will bring me back again."}
{"text":"Excellent New York style pizza! I never expected to find this good of pizza in Phoenix, but maybe I should. The entire city is an oven!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Great atmosphere! If you're in the Scottsdale area it's a must. I had just had a good pizza a couple days before at La Bocca on Mill in Tempe and this was on par."}
{"text":"The hubs, babylove and I stopped by Grimaldi's Pizzeria last Saturday for a late lunch. A dear friend of mine had been telling me forever about how wonderful the pizza was here. We finally got to find out for ourselves what all the buzz was about.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza with a ceasar salad; and I ordered a glass of the house red wine. The salad was a perfectly dressed ceasar--not too much dressing but not so little that you're just eating dry romaine. The pizza was delicious! That crust truly is so crispy and appetizing! And of course the wine was a perfect compliment to the meal. A bit on the dry side with a bit of a bite but delicious nonetheless.  And because I am all about the ambiance of an establishment, I was very impressed with the 'hand' of the table linens. Red and white checked tablecloths with a heavy cotton hand prove this is no cheesy (no pun intended) Italian joint. The table is simply set with just the minimum items needed for your meal.   As for the customer service--from the hostess that greeted us to the waiter, we experienced friendly, professional service. Everyone was kind, helpful and knowledgeable. I look forward to visiting Grimaldi's again in the very near future!"}
{"text":"We rolled in with a party of 10 for my Son's 21st b-day party. The pizza pies are great - thin crust and very tasty. The place can get very busy...however the waiters and waitresses don't miss a beat with great service."}
{"text":"Want a good NY pizza. Well look no further! Man-o-Man do they do it right with their brick oven. Any toppings you want, they got but I do suggest that you don't put too many on the pizza because it just ruins it. Plus the toppings get heavy and your pizza wouldn't support it. The other plus is their Ceaser Salad. Everything is good including the staff who is on point! Good job guys and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"A moth landed in my coworkers' cappuccino after our meal, and even though it was a completely random happening our server saw it happen, immediately replaced the cappuccino and gave her a $5 gift card for her trouble. Now that's service!   The food is spectacular. The pizzas are filling - I was full after two slices, whereas with a typical pizza I can easily eat 3-4 pieces.   You must try the cheesecake. Our table tried the traditional cheesecake and the Oreo cheesecake and they were both delicious. Like undo-your-belt-to-make-more-room delicious."}
{"text":"Always on top of there game at this location The pizza is amazing.   Don't like that you have to pay extra for Sauce , its kind of hit or miss on the amount they actually put in.    It's all done by hand so it's going to happen.  There salad is on point , no they don't have ranch Oil and vinaigrette  I have never been on for a think pizza but this place did change my mind."}
{"text":"I think they may have the best pizza in Vegas! We're simple so we just get pepperoni with fresh basil.  I love the fact that they use fresh mozzarella.  Grimaldi's is never is disappointment!! These dessert trio is yummy and really satisfying with decent portions. I also love that they give you a free pizza for your birthday!"}
{"text":"I dream of crispy, yummy, oh-so-perfect slices of plain with extra crispy basil after eating here.  The first time I ate here I dreamt of the food and ate here every day for fourteen consecutive days.  It was heaven, it's still heaven, and I am an avid fan of the thin pizza here.  There are a few places I  love to stop at time and again, and Grimaldi's is one of those places you'll never get sick of.  Their sauce is fresh and has just the right tang, their mozzarella is creamy and flavorful.  I don't ruin the flavor of the pizza and crust with lots of toppings; rather, I just place some basil on it and call it a day.  The taste of crispy basil on their classic pizza is to die for.    There are few pizza places I'll give four stars to, and I love Grimaldi's because their sauce isn't too puckery and their cheese is so darn perfect.  No matter how many times I eat here and swear to try something new, I don't have the heart to ruin the classic cheese with anything else.  I grab a small basil, extra basil, and call it a day.  Try it out.  The food is great, the service is good, and despite being almost $20 a pizza depending on how many toppings you get, it's worth every penny."}
{"text":"Pizza was great!  YUMM YUMM YUMM YUMM YUMM.  The table cloths were perfectly crisp and the wine glasses were aligned in an orderly fashion.  You can tell they have a very meticulous staff.  Obviously the management takes pride in this restaurant.  WOWZA I am just so impressed.  I requested dough to play with after I saw some children playing with some.  I have never had so much fun in 40 years of existence.  I know where I'll be going to celebrate my 41st *wink*wink*.   Can we take a second and talk about the service.  OUTSTANDING.  No... MINDBLOWING.  Anthony was my bartender.  He made me a green apple sangria that rocked my socks off.  BRAVO GRIMALDIS BRAVO.  I will be back weekly to visit him.  He is my new favorite person. I ordered some of the chocolate cheesecake as well.  Reminded my of my granny's chocolate cream pie.  Only thing missing from my fabulous experience is ranch.  Ranch would be a perfect addition.  Just a suggestion.  Oh and pineapple.  I love a Hawaiian Pie."}
{"text":"To eat here you must love coal brick-oven pizza, sliced mozarella, fresh sauce and thin crust. If you do, you'll like the pizza at Grimaldi's.  Although I lack experience with true NY style pizza, I must say that if this represents a small percentage of it, I'm down for some NY love.    Grimaldi's is all about the oven, the crust, and the fresh ingredients.  When I saw the 3.5 star rating two weeks ago I realized that I had to eat the pizza to find out for myself.  Mind you, all of us have different tastes when it comes to pizza, each person wanting a certain stretch to the dough or sweetness to the sauce.  I personally love sweeter sauce, but at Grimaldi's it's more tangy.  I personally love shredded cheese but here it's sliced fresh mozzarella.  I needed to try something different, so I went for the personal with basil.  It took ten minutes to complete my pizza, not long at all.  When I received the box I sort of freaked out at the size.  I'm used to the pizza hut sizes, where personal means that small round personal pan pizza.  Their version of personal reminds me of a medium, or something very close to that.  The crust is super thin, slightly crispy especially on the edges, and the ingredients are layered nicely on top.  It was interesting to see the sauce exposed between the slices of cheese, and crispy basil on top.  I hopped into my car, turned on the a/c, and peeled a slice from the box.  Wow.  This pizza is yummy.  I'm not going to go so far as to say something fabulous, amazing, or even orgasmic, but I love this pizza.  At the point it's slightly soggy from the sauce, but still holds up while you eat it.  It's one of those pizzas I recommend folding the sides in a bit while holding it to eat it properly.  My husband hates crust and he ate the whole pizza--crust and all.  I love the tangy fresh tomato sauce, the mozzarella that stretches beautifully when bitten in to, and I go for basil in the oven rather than after because it gets sweeter and has that crispy texture to it.  Yum.  After the first time there I went back two days later for the same order.  Then two days after that.  Oh and then three days from that day, and then four days ago and the day before yesterday.  Yeah.  I like it that much. I always order the same thing--personal with basil--because I don't want to ruin the flavors of the other ingredients and the crust.  I love the taste of the dough on this pizza--slightly sweet, almost a hint of sourdough-ness, and you can taste the char a bit.    Remember, we all have different tastes, and many aren't in to this type of pizza.  For me, it's the only pizza I'll eat till I find another great NY pizza joint in town.  The other downfall of this place are the prices.  Many wouldn't pay $9 for a personal size and then pay $2-$5 dollars per additional topping.  The small is $13, for example, so many get turned off by the price.  Still, it's a great pizza joint that I've yet to eat in at because I love the idea of getting a pizza in a box.  It's just this weird thing I have with pizza.  You should try Grimaldi's if you haven't yet.  It's not your typical pizza delivery crap, but something ten times better.  I like it, and I hope that your taste in pizza matches this place, too."}
{"text":"The pizza here was super yummy! We ordered a half-and-half with Brooklyn bridge on one half and The Don on the other half. The other pizza was just a custom one with cheese and olives. We got two small pizzas to share between three people and we had two slices left. The Don was my favorite, hands down. We each ended up paying about $13, not bad for some thin and crispy delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salads! Went here on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. A little out of the way depending on where you're staying, but worth the trip.   A great place to enjoy a meal with friends. A large pizza should reasonably feed 3 - 4 people. Stays open til 2am? AWESOME"}
{"text":"So this review is going to stand out- ahem.... okay carrying on.   We went to Grimaldi's our first night in Vegas this last weekend mostly because it was the only thing open by the time we got into Vegas.  I'll be the first to admit that a pizza joint is no place for someone with a gluten allergy. That being said, I am surprised at how many places provide gluten free pizza...but I don't expect it. I try to avoid being a pain in the you know what to servers so I generally call ahead or just avoid these places, but this night we had no choice so I expected to graze from the salad bar.   Now the skinny- We get there and I inform the server I'm gluten intolerant and ask if the salad dressings are gluten free. He simply responded- we don't have a gluten free menu. I acknowledge this and asked again if he could just have the kitchen check the back of their salad dressings to ensure they don't have gluten I'd be happy with their salad choices. He just repeated himself that they didn't have a gluten free menu and asked to take the orders of the other people at the table. I was so offended but at the same time I feel bad about my allergy so I just decided I wouldn't eat anything that night.   Had it not been for my friend who went up to the hostess and asked her to please make sure their balsamic was gluten free I'd have not eaten. I was able to have this so I ordered the Mediterranean salad with no dressing and my boyfriend and I shared this with oil and balsamic. My only compliment about this salad was that it was a good portion, but we both agreed it was pretty bad otherwise. Ingredients didn't seem fresh and it was just a run of the mill salad for 15 bucks. My boyfriend had some of the pizza our friends ordered and wasn't enticed by it.  Our friends did seem to enjoy their pizza and I do have to say the beers were pretty cheap as my boyfriend enjoyed a few of them to help get through the salad ;)   So, seems like everyone loves this place but unfortunately my experience with both service and food was very very Meh."}
{"text":"Highly rated location, so my friends and I decided to give this place a try. First off, horrible service. Very inattentive, very slow, and very lazy. We went around 3 P.M., so it wasn't busy at all, which makes me wonder why we weren't receiving any service. In fact, it was pretty overstaffed (it was about one server per table), yet we received no service. No worries, I thought, the food will definitely be worth it since there was so much positive feedback! NOT! Disappointed again. First off, its a thin crust pizza, which means it really shouldn't take very long. Took over 40 minutes. It made me wonder how they would be able to handle it if the place was packed. Maybe it is just never packed..... Pizza was sub par. Cheese got rubbery after five minutes. The crust was burnt on many areas. I enjoy a little burn since it is stone oven, but this was excessive. The sausage was good though, but what is the point of a good tasting ingredient if the pizza as a whole tasted like garbage. I do not recommend this location at all and will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"5 stars is based on the food only.  The location at the Scottsdale Quarter is extremely loud/noisy and the table turn-over rate is slow, making it a longer wait than necessary to get a table.  Service is just \"ok\", could use a bit of  personal service and smiles."}
{"text":"To sum it up it was Great Pizza and excellent service, as a family, we ordered 4 different types of pizzas and they were all tasty , the crust could be better, but it was delicious, great and friendly environment ...overall it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Bianca was our server, very friendly an informative. Had a dinner for two and started with the antipasto, perfectly portioned and fresh. Ended with a personal white pizza with chicken mushrooms and olives. Tasty and great for the price. 40 bucks for an appetizer, pizza and sangria sized for two AND it was flavorful, coupled with good service. I'd say that's a successful meal."}
{"text":"I used to work in Manhattan and yes I am one of those that believe our water does make for the best pizza and bagels.  When I moved to Gilbert and saw that they had a Grimaldi's at first I didn't think anything of it. I thought it was just some pizza restaurant that coincidentally had the same name as my beloved pizza joint in NY.  But upon further review I saw that it was one and the same, and that apparently they have expanded westward.  They have even gone so far as to employ a chemist and install a custom water pumping system that ensures that the mineral content and composition is exactly the same as NY.  I think I just shed a tear.  If my tears were as delicious as this precious water I would be in business.   Anyway, on to the food.  We ordered a large Caesar salad and the lettuce was crisp and not drenched in dressing, a huge plus. We also had the white pizza with garlic and a pizza with half sausage and the other half basil and tomato.  Both were outstanding.  Overall, I have no idea how I lucked out by having a Grimaldi's down the street from me 2,500 miles away from NYC but I am not complaining.  This place is awesome."}
{"text":"The house salad is full of many favorite items and covered in a nice Vinaigrette Dressing.  They have several sauces to choose from. The topping list has just about anything you would want on a Pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldis knows anchovies. It takes the right touch and they do it right. Excellent service too."}
{"text":"10 stars!!!  Always the best time and time again. Biting through the crust, you get the crunch of the coal brickoven baked crust with the most sublime chewy middle - perfection in thin crust!  In my ripe old age, I've learned that less is more when it comes to pizza so now the toppings are limited to two, maybe three. The only topping that you HAVE to get is ricotta cheese on your pizza. Sounded weird when my wife ordered it the first time but now we can't do without it. It's unlike any other ricotta I've tried  Trust me on the ricotta... You'll thank me later. It's a must stop whenever we are back in the Valley."}
{"text":"5/5 price 5/5 quality and freshness of ingredients 5/5 amazing service   I have been to 3 Grimaldi locations and feel that this one is the best of the 3. Located inside the palazzo (NOT GRAND CANAL SHOPPES), it can be easily missed. A lot smaller than the other locations but service here is a lot better.  We had a party of 4 and were celebrating a birthday. My friend had a FREE large pizza for her birthday. We added meatballs, pepperoni and ricotta cheese. The meatballs are so soft and perfectly seasoned, not dry either. The pepperoni isn't like other pizza places that I've been to, it's a lot smaller and I don't really think it's that good. They don't skimp on the ricotta cheese either. Their pizzas aren't oily... Like at all. Each topping was about an additional $4. I feel that their toppings are limited but very fresh. They don't have any pineapple in case you're wondering. crust here is super thin but a large can definitely feed 3-4 people if you order sides!! I think a large pizza is $19.  We also ordered a large antipasto ($9) which came with bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, salami and olives. We were given slices of bread and olive oil and balsamic vinegar to enjoy with the antipasto. We also ordered the large house salad ($9) which came with romaine lettuce, mushrooms, olives, red onions and I'm not sure if I remember seeing tomatoes or not. It has a light and refreshing dressing.   The 4 of us were too full to eat dessert so I would say be careful when you order a large pizza because it IS very large. Also, you can do half pizza with toppings and the other half with different toppings but you still have to pay the entire price for the toppings if that makes sense.  Our server was so sweet, she explained the menu and their current specials and continually checked in on us. Our waters were always refilled. Food came out in a good amount of time.   Lovely decor, dim lighting, if you sit by the window you get a good view. Perfect for date nights."}
{"text":"My two friends and I had just finished hiking and were starving so we checked Yelp for some recommendations and decided to go with Grimaldis. SO GLAD WE DID!   Let me start off by saying that I love pizza. If I could eat pizza everyday, I would! I'm normally not a huge fan of thin crust but we ordered a large pepperoni, ricotta and sausage pizza and it was great. My only issue was that there was too much ricotta, so every bite we took had a nice hunk of ricotta but I shouldn't be complaining... Fresh ingredients, super hot, had a nice crunch to it and it was huge!   We also ordered the large House salad (I think) and a small plate of antipasta. We had about half of the pizza left to take home. Great quality for a really decent price.   Our server was very nice and came back frequently to check on us. some people were dressed casually (like my friends and I in gym clothes) or dressed up. There was a couple next to use that seemed to be on their first date and another table with two ladies enjoying wine.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I think I am a bigger fan of their regular pizza, compared to their white pizza with garlic.......nice casual atmosphere, attentive service.....also had a very good Mediterranean salad!....rather limited menu."}
{"text":"Two words. WHITE SAUCE. HOLY HELL! Never had such great flavored sauce in my entire life.  NY style thin crust that even true blooded new yorkers swear by, the salad was good but that really wasn't what I was there for.  We ordered two pies, one white sauce and one red. WE knew it was entirely too much food but we didn't care. We were there to eat and to eat good. We walked out after the most delicious pizza and smiled the whole car ride home. They deliver, they have a nice bar, they have friendly staff and decent beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever. Ordered online for 6 hungry kids after a long road trip. After almost two hours our food had not arrived. I called the restaurant and was put on hold for 10 minutes. I then got a call that the restaurant was too busy so our order had been cancelled. They said they don't think my credit card will be charged so I \"it should be all good.\" Literally the worst pizza order experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"GRIMALDI'S has become our favorite pizza spot. What do you like thin crust, thick crust, or deep dish, this is one of the best pizzas  in town. Service here is always great but remember the place gets very crowded during the weekends and most evenings so give the waitstaff a break and be patient.   Their Mediterranean salad is enormous and can be shared by two or three easily."}
{"text":"First time here... not sure if it's worth the wait. Waited 1.5 hours for a table. The food was New York thin crust not too bad. Overall the service was eager to please everyone m a really busy night. Food was alright."}
{"text":"Came in here with very high expectations and it was good but I just cannot give it 5 stars. We waited to be seated outside somewhere nice but ended up getting put in the alley. The toppings are way too pricey in my opinion because I like to get a variety on my pizza. I wish there was more topping choices as well..I heard they get asked a lot about having pineapple as a topping and seems like they won't listen.  They will take request to do certain toppings on only half of the pizza....but they will still charge you full price which is fine but when I asked if I could get my topping on half the pizza but the same amount of topping to be used as if I ordered it on the whole pizza and the server argued with me and said no without any valid reason so I just said forget it. The pizza took a very long time but finally came out after close to 40 minutes.   The pizza crust was thin but not too thin which I liked.  There was not enough sauce for my liking and the cheese was just ok as well as the toppings.  If it was not so expensive and if they had more interesting toppings I think this place could have been really good. If you like plain pizza i.e just pepperoni then you might find this place is good for you but if I'm having only pizza for dinner I want to add lots of toppings.  The food is 4 stars but after writing this review and rather poor customer service I decided over all this place gets 3 stars."}
{"text":"Oh man, I love Grimaldis! Their pizza is incredible. I always get the white pizza with mushrooms and olives. This pizza does not need many toppings because the cheese and crust are both delicious. The cheese is slices of fresh mozzarella, which I love. The pizza is never soggy or burnt. The only negative about grimaldis is that the prices are a little high. It's $22 for a plain pizza and toppings vary from $2-3 each. Good thing I don't like a lot of toppings on my pizza! They also are always very busy so make sure you either plan ahead or go earlier in the day. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I typically do not like chains, but I love Grimaldi's pizza.  The pizza has super thin, crispy crust and great toppings (like meatballs!!!); salads are nothing special, but satisfying (and always get eaten).  If you haven't been, you should try it...if you are a thin crust fan it will give your faves a run for their money."}
{"text":"came here for my mother's birthday pizza dinner. we came on a weeknight (tuesday) and learned they had half price glasses of wine (not including sangria or the house wines.) I have been to the original brooklyn shop and was a little iffy of the pizza here. we had to try it though and so glad we did. rachel was our server and was friendly and helpful. we started off with some sangria for 6 dollars a glass. I had the red, which was a little strong, just the way i like, while my mom had the white, which was really sweet, just how she likes. we ordered the large white garlic pizza with half chicken and half meatball. now beware they do charge you the same prices of toppings even if you order half. (toppings are where they catch you with price.) it can get expensive. the pizza was 18 dollars while the grilled chicken was 5 dollars and the meatballs coming in at 2 dollars. that is 25 dollars total for a large pizza if you can't do math. after we took our first folded pizza bites we knew we had a winner though. my favorite was the meatball side while my mom loved the grilled chicken. thin crust perfect for folding and a tasty white garlic pizza that wasn't too overwhelming on the garlic flavor. i could taste everything and everything was amazing. very well done grimaldi's. we finished 2 slices each and had another 4 to take home for leftovers. (which i should add were finished off by the time we went to bed. so good!) we saved a little room for dessert and ordered the caramel apple cheesecake for another 5 dollars. holy cheesecake Gods! talk about melt in your mouth good. since it was my mom's birthday I let her eat the majority of it, but i could go back just for a piece of that little heaven. it was a great fall dessert with so much flavor. it even had little pieces of apples in the cheesecake. yums! my mother has talked about this pizza every night now. i know she loved it as did i. it lived up to the talk and i am sure to be a regular now. thanks grimaldi's for making her birthday dinners one to be remembered just by the food and the nice service."}
{"text":"I am a grimaldi's pizza addict. I work nearby so always call in a togo order for a personal pizza. The service is always friendly and on top of things. They don't offer many food choices. salad, pizza, and that's pretty much it, but their pizza is my favorite. I am always torn between the white pizza with meatballs or the pesto pizza with meatballs. they both just make my mouth water. mmm this location also serves alcohol and has a bar. great for after work or after a day of shopping till you're dropping in the fashion show mall. I LOVE their red sangria. It is def worth stopping in if you are staying on the strip or shopping in the mall."}
{"text":"Everyone says that the best pizza in Arizona is Pizzera Bianco.  I think it is Grimaldi's.  I am 99% vegan, but when I have cheat days, it is for cheese pizza and there are only a couple of places I am going to cheat at.  Grimaldi's is one.  I swear I could eat an entire 18\" by myself.  Update: I ate an 18\" pizza by myself in one sitting and I'm not a big guy.  145 lbs.....plus a pizza."}
{"text":"I just realized how a Grimaldi's Pizza is absent a puffy edge. I've never noticed this before. Mainly because I'm too busy gawking at all the bad plastic surgery forty somethings and their out-of-control kids.   No complaints.  The pizza is thin and flavorful, but the big rounded edge (cornicione) that's both chewy and crispy was missing, which led me to the conclusion that our pie resembled more of a flatbread than a traditional pizza.  The other thing you won't find here is a traditional Napolitana pie.  No sign of a Margherita anywhere on the menu. They do however offer additional basil for two bucks which will get you a reasonable facsimile.  If you want a great pie, go to Naples.  A good pie, Chris Bianco's Pizzeria Bianco in south Phoenix. And a pie that's light years above the chains and consistent as hell, Grimaldi's.  So you're not going to get a big cornicione. Nor will you get a traditional Margherita. But, you will get a Saturday night, plastic surgery freakshow that'll make most men do a full body shiver, like after taking a pee."}
{"text":"Being one of the only Italian-Americans on the planet who believes pizza and lap dances are the biggest waste of money, sadly, I continue to take pleasure in both.   You know those three wise monkeys....see, hear, and speak no evil?  Well, I'm the fourth. Taste no evil. I hate bad pizza.  Which is why I go here. I'm never disappointed.   The other reason I go here is because of Patsy Grimaldi himself, (God rest his soul) We Italians do that.  We always feel the need to invoke 'God rest his soul' when speaking of the dead, despite it being highly inappropriate.   Anyway, Patsy's story is an interesting one, and one you can only find on their menu, which is another good reason to go here.  And here's one more, in case you're not sold on the place yet.  It's in the Scottsdale Quarter, where there are plenty of girls, many of whom look like aspiring young strippers. You'll have to use your imagination. On the girls, certainly not the pizza."}
{"text":"Hearing that this is a New York transplant in Vegas, my friend had urged that I try out Grimaldi's. Upon arriving in Vegas, this was the first place we hit up, less than an hour after they opened.   The hostess was quick to meet us and sat us outside in the main shopping area. I was hesitant at first because I didn't want the feel of being a zoo animal in an exhibit.   My friend ordered the classic Margherita pizza while I ordered the plain pesto pizza.  Knowing that they freshly make their pizzas, we waited patiently and were more than thrilled with the pizzas arrived. Shortly after we got our food, there was a holiday special performance with Santa and his dancing elves. This attracted a lot of attention throughout the mall, and hence, made me feel like the zoo animal I feared I'd become.  People would walk by, pointing at what we were eating. And to add brownie points? Close to the end of the holiday performance, 'fake snow' started falling from the ceiling of the shopping center, so we got the complimentary topping of soap suds on our pizza.  This was the reason this review is 3 stars, not 4 or 5. I felt my experience was really ruined as a result of the special performance and eating outside in the shopping area.  TIPS: 1. Don't eat here on the weekends in December. 2. Eat inside if you can, don't sit out in the shopping area. 3. Order the pesto - it's yummy.  Overall, the pizza was tasty. I love NY style pizza [I actually love all forms of pizza - i don't discriminate]. Grimaldi's knows how to impress with their pies - too bad the locale was not as impressive.  Staff is friendly - moderately attentive with the water. Just when I thought our server forgot us, he would show up. Not sure I'd come back since Vegas is full of great places to feast at, but definitely won't pass it up if Grimaldi's came up in culinary consideration conversation."}
{"text":"We had wine, salad, pizza AND calzone. Everything was absolutely delicious!!! We weren't sure which wines to order and the waiter offered us a couple of samples to help us chose."}
{"text":"The pesto and Italian sausage is great. Sometimes you have,to tell them to go easy on the pesto. When the manager Mr. Nguyen is there you definitely see the difference in service versus when he is not. He is always on top of things. You'll see him doing everything from refilling drinks, delivery to the table to cleaning up the tables."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! Wine , salad, pizza it's all amazing, sitting with Pam an Bill their last meal in Las Vegas, January 18, 2018"}
{"text":"Located at park west in the West valley area this is a real find. Looking for a place for dinner and a show this is it. Directly across from Harkins theatre this is good brick oven pizza and delicious as it can get. The atmosphere is pleasant and there is outdoor dining. The wait staff is knowledgeable and friendly and mky experience is always positive. This is a good place to eat before or after a game as it is located just down from the sports arenas and worth the time to atop.and dine"}
{"text":"very nice staff. great house salad I could like bathe in it's tasty dressing for my life. I don't actually like pizza, but this stuff was no joke .Delicious sauce, very cheesey ,excellent crust. I'll be back next time I'm in Arizona"}
{"text":"Went to this location today for lunch with my husband and my 2 kids. If we could give this location 10 stars we would. The food was fantastic. The server was on top of everything. The manager Vince was extremely down to earth and so friendly. I loved the atmosphere. We sat outside on the patio and it was awesome. We WILL Definately be back with our family to enjoy more of their delicious food."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food, and the sangria is actually really top notch. Highly recommend the plain-jane pepperoni, as this will give you a basis to compare all other lower forms of pizza you have encountered prior to theirs (it may be simple, but the ingredients are awesome). Also, the cheese cake is almost too damned good and decadent. The friendly crew that runs the place takes care of you. Great for date nights, family/group gatherings, or just ordering up a good take-out pie. They make it the old-fashioned way, and though it comes at a bit of a higher price than your run-of-the-mill fast food pizzas, I can nearly assure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"In the past, I have eaten twice before at a different location. Both times I got burned crust pizza with spots of charcoal. But we decided to try the San Tan location yesterday at 4 pm. The hostess greeted us with \"Are you ok with our Stocker policy?\" Huh? She then tells us they will be cleaning out their oven so there will be no pizza for an hour. This seems like a self defeating policy designed to turn away customers. We left. We tried again today at lunch time.  I specifically asked our server if she would ask for a light bake on the crust. The pizza had burned edges. She serves it and says \"is that light enough for you?\"  I have included a picture. Not what I requested, and not the way I like pizza."}
{"text":"This is the only Grimaldi's location I've been to and I very much enjoyed my the food.  They boast having the best coal-fired brick oven, New York-style thin crust pizza in the world and it's hard for me to argue against them.  It certainly beats any other chain or franchise pizza place I've been too.  They have tons of toppings to choose from, but I recommend their white pizza with pepperoni and extra garlic.  You'll smell terrible after, but it is oh so delicious!  A personal size could probably feed 2 people.  Now if only they opened a location in Southern California..."}
{"text":"What a great find while I was walking around waiting to leave for my flight home!  I had never heard of Grimaldi's before and I'm glad I stopped by.  I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and a small pizza.  I couldn't decide between two pies so the server suggested I do a half and half!  I thought that was awesome considering I was only getting a small pie.  I got half white pie with mushrooms and half red with meatballs.  I couldn't decide which side was better... both were absolutely amazing!  The pizza had perfectly crispy thin crust And to make deciding my favorite thing worse, the Mediterranean Salad was sooooooooooo good!  It was a huge salad and everything was just so fresh too.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I'm perfectly fine w driving 5 hrs from OC for decent pizza, and Grimaldi's did not disappoint! The antipasto could've been better but the pizza was very good."}
{"text":"I was just leaving Venetian casino. Called in for quick pick up order. Asked what ingrediants they have. Told to go online. That should have been my first clue.   Ordered anyways . Nickel and dimed for each and EVERY topping.   Total bill was $100 for 2 small pizzas. Yes you heard that right - $100 for 2 small pizzas.  AND ......  WHAT A TERRIBLE PIZZA !!!! ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE !!!!!   Total bait and swtich!  Crust tastes like grainy cardboard! Order was NOT made correctly!  There is no sauce on BOTH pizzas! I was even charged for missing toppings!    Worst of all .... there is only a minor difference from this gluten free crust vs. dominos. I think they are the same crusts. Factory made and frozen. Does not taste like coal oven pizza AT ALL. Thd coan oven is most likley a marketing gimmick. Probably gas lighted oven through fake coals .. like a fake fireplace ...   Either way the gluten free pizza is so awful and dry. I don't even want to finsih this garbage. So dry and tasteless. I will likely throw it out.   Good thing there are so many drunks in Vegas. ANYTHING tastes good when you're drunk. No other explation for the 4 star ratings here. Terrible Pizza !   NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I think I came into this dining experience with higher expectations. We visited on a Friday night about 2 hours before closing. There were 2 other tables occupied in the whole joint. Our server was nice and attentive. I liked the decor and the atmosphere but was turned off by the clanging of dishes and buckets as they worked hard to mop and clean. The floors were soaked. We could hear the cleaning and smell the cleaning product. This detracted from my whole experience. I could see if it was 30 min prior to closing, but we still had 2 hours. We had the margarita pizza which I enjoyed but it was a little thin. Guess that was just the style. I'd be willing to give it another try but I'd prob go earlier in the day, not as close to closing."}
{"text":"Holy Mother! Honestly by far the best pizza I've EVER had! Ordered the pepperoni pizza and same out to perfection. The cheese just melts in your mouth and isn't too cheesy or over powering. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Well ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls in a word supercalfragulisticexpealadious! After all these years of living in a place devoid of really good food on every corner, like NY City say east coast New York pizza has finally arrived to the west coast!!!! So here is the set up: The West Coast Kitty's Youngest Son was wed in Utah on March 15th 2014. Her oldest son, she and myself drove back to LA on that Monday the 17th. On the drive up to Utah for the wedding there was a semi fire on the highway outside of Vegas, which backed traffic up for hours. It was suggested that we stop in Vegas and get a pie from Gramaldi's, which I thought was \"out of the blue\" kind of suggestion. So armed with that thought I brought Gramaldi's up on the drive home. After the West Coast Kitty read a description of this place there were absolutely no doubts that we where stopping in Vegas for a pie and that's exactly what we did! So now that we all have the set up let's get to the Epic food! The WCK order the Antipasto dish an her son asked me to pick the pie. I needed a little info so I inquired, that the cheese they use is authentic buffalo mozzarella. They have their water altered by a chemist once a week. The Fire Roast the red peppers in house. They offer ricotta cheese as a topping. So the pie was A large three topping pie with Pepperoni, Roasted Red Peppers and Ricotta. I waited hoping not to be disappointed and suddenly the pie arrived. So the waitress served a slice to Dayne and a slice to me and ask I we needed anything else, no we said and off she went. I looked at the two of them whom were staring back at me waiting and so I took a bite, Ohh My Stars it was absolute NY Heaven! Everything about this pie was awesome, which The WCK mentioned to her son of my happiness an her relief and nudge him to taste. He took a bite chewed and swallowed. He took another bite just as slow and chewed and swallowed. He than proclaimed that it was the best pizza he had eaten in his entire life! I would say that says it all, as I do agree with almost all of that statement! The WCK's Antipasto was Italian through and through as it was all meats, cheese, bread, spiced olive oil and no salad anywhere just to die for good. I will say it will be for sure the best pizza you have wet eaten if you are from California. If your east coast and dying for NY Pizza then I suggested you make your way down Gramaldi's in El Segundo CA and grab a pie and beer! I know I will be seeing you there as Gramaldi's is the authentic real deal and has been for over 100 years! I say give me more stars as five isn't even close to enough!!!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizzeria entered the world by way of Brooklyn.  Coal oven brick pizza, for those wanting a break from hearty deep dish, is a nice break.  Grimaldi's goes to great lengths to preserve their New York true ingredients:  claiming the secret to their true New York-style pizza is \"in the water.\"  They hired a chemist to analyze, recreate the mineral content, and composition of the local water in New York.  This composition is replicated and installed by a custom water system at each Grimaldi's nationwide.  Talk about keeping true to form!  (Facts acquired from Grimaldi's Story online)  Upon entering to the right-hand side, there is a small bar area and patio seating.  Main dining area is front and center, with even a room in the far back for private parties. You are immediately greeted by the hostess and promptly seated. The feel is old New York, nice and dim lighting but not too dark. I particularly love the wine bottles suspended from the ceiling as lights.  I ordered their thin coal oven pizza with Italian sausage, black olives, and mushrooms.  Thin crust and evenly loaded with toppings. It's easy to eat more than a normal serving due to the deceptive thin crust. Regardless, it is a delicious mistake to make. Pricing for each topping is additional ($2.00-$5.00 each additional topping).  It might work out better for future menus, if they created pizzas priced accordingly with toppings already added. Advertisement  Dessert cannot be ignored.  Their home-style Oreo cheesecake ($5.00) is decadent and delicious for any Oreo fan.  If you are looking for other dessert fare, they also have cannolis ($4.50) and tiramisu ($5.00).  Sign up for their VIP Newsletter, to keep ahead of special events.  You will also receive a coupon in your email for a free large pizza on your birthday!  The staff here is friendly and accommodating, even the manager came over to say hello and check in on my experience.  If you cannot get to New York right away, Grimaldi's Pizzeria is certainly worth your time.  They take great pains to keep to their history and content, and one can taste this in every bite."}
{"text":"The pizza here is so yummy!  Great location. Wonderfully kind staff. Great to eat at the bar, get a table or pick up take out.  I have been here many times and it is one of the best pizza places in Scottsdale for sure.  Love Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Of the 3 locations oddly this one seems to be the busiest. Still excellent Pizza. Highly recommend for dining in or taking out.  Great salads too. Love everything about this place. Anyone who says there is no good pizza in Scottsdale has never been to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"One of the best Pizza places in Scottsdale without question. Great to dine in or take out from. Consistently everything I ever had here has been delicious and the wait staff so wonderful. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. It actually got me to write the first yelp review in a long time. Caesars, pizza and trio for dessert is easy to recommend. A rock Solid 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've ever had in Nevada!! The service is superior to any other Vegas restaurant I've been to. Vince and his staff are second to none. The food is amazing!! You definitely need to stop by if you're in Vegas! I try and save some to take home but end up eating it by midnight. Nom nom."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza I have ever had.  This location is in the Shoppes at the Palazzo/Venetian. Came here because of the great Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  How good is the pizza? I ordered a Caprese salad to start, and it was probably one of the worst Caprese salads I have ever had. Dry and chewy mozzarella, flavorless tomato, limp basil, weak olive oil. I order Caprese salads almost everywhere they are offered and this is in the bottom 2 or 3 I have ever eaten. But the pizza here is SO good that I am giving 5 stars anyway. That's how good it is.  It's a coal-fired brick oven, thin crust pizza. With dough made from water they truck across the country from New York just to make it authentic. We had a pizza with spicy sausage, pepperoni and sliced tomatoes, and it was epic. It was \"I want to go throw up in the bathroom like the Ancient Romans to make room for more of this pizza\" epic. It was \"if someone runs in and grabs the last piece of pizza off my plate, I am chasing him down and beating him to death with a chair\" epic.   Dammit, now I need more of it. Thanks, Yelp. Just writing this review has convinced me I need to make another trip for more."}
{"text":"I like there pizza because no matter what it comes out pipping hot... Missing a star because I not like there pricing... But at the sametime I understand....or so I think I understand?"}
{"text":"There is no dearth of quality pizza in Phoenix.  You would have thought we bordered the Bronx or Naples instead of old Mexico.  Between Bianco, LGO, Pino's, Slice of Sicily, Nello's, and Cassanova Brothers we have enough tasty and distinctive pies for every day of the week.  I was a little hesitant to try Grimaldi's at first.  The location, after all, is essentially an outdoor mall laden with chains and conformity.  But hunger and a desire to try a place that claimed to offer the best coal fired pizza this side of NY got me in the door.  The pizza is lighter and smoky, unburdened by excess ingredients and heavy grease.  The best pizzas succeed in their simplicity and Grimaldi's is no exception.  You can taste the quality in the mozzarella and the sauce is a quiet and sweet companion that really ties everything together.  The place has now earned a spot in my East Valley pizza rotation.  A great pizza that has flavor and won't give you a coronary."}
{"text":"I love this pizza, nice thin crust and good ingredients.   Prices keep going up which is expected but it went up a to much in my opinion.   Service is hit or miss but overall pretty good. Several locations in Vegas and all I've been to do well.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Omg the pizza was delicious. The service was great. The ambiance is very casual and easy going.  I would definetly come back here. Descently priced!"}
{"text":"Oh, what has happened to the pizza? We used to go out of our way for this pizza,  but no more.  The last few visits were deeply disappointing.  The pizzas were VERY under baked.  The inner third of the pizzas were raw dough.  Just nasty.  It appears they have forgotten how to make a pizza.  I doubt we will ever return.  It's a crying shame."}
{"text":"The pizza was super good! The atmosphere was very nice as well.  But I want to comment on there amazing service!  We went there with 3 people...myself,my wife and her best friend. 2 of us ordered calzones and one ordered a personal pizza.  They brought the pizza out right away and the 2 that ordered the calzones had to wait 5-10 extra minutes because the calzones take longer to cook.  We didn't say anything to the waiter or make any comments or even feel that it was that big of a deal but the manager came over and apologized for the difference in time between the pizza and the calzones.  She offered to buy us dessert.  We all just thought it was very professional that they addressed the problem even though we never even said there was an issue.    Fun and classy place...highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love the place  The pizza was as good or better than Pizzeria Bianco. They had large meatballs on the pizza that required a longer cooking time so they told us and we were fine with that. A nice perfectly done wood fired pizza with a few black blisters. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Was there for my Birthday, my son printed out a coupon for a FREE Pizza does it get any better than that!!!! Was there about a month ago, OMG the  green salad  is just prefect.. I could go back just for that...but the pizza is delicious too!! Great place to eat along!!!"}
{"text":"Well well, after reading all those nice reviews, i decided to finally give This place a try....First , i am a Pizza lover and may have high expectations when it come to pizza making process (dough, cooking and ingredients)... Putting aside the fact that you build your own and therefore taste and choices vary, this review is for the basic pizza (dough, sauce and cheese). Nothing fancy and rather bad, receipe lacks of taste and flavor...(coal oven cooking does not add anything to a bad receipe ) Sadly , i will continue going next door and keep using the only place that knows how to make real pizza (which i will not mention here as it will false my review) Good luck"}
{"text":"We went to Grimaldi's in the Fashion Show Mall off Las Vegas Blvd. We went b/c we had read reviews about it being an allergy friendly restaurant. We have a child who has severe peanut/nut allergy.   Upon being seated our waitress, Yadira was 100% knowledgeable and conveyed that to us and our family when we asked about ingredients and food preparation. If you have an allergy you know how important this is, nothing worse than a server who gives you the \"you should be ok\" answer.   Not only was the experience great but the pizza was fantastic! Two kids shared a 12\" and three adults shared a 16\". We probably could of gotten an 18\" or we should of gotten an appetizer.   I should also mention it was really busy and we received our meal in 15 minutes. Thin crust oven pizza is apparently pretty quick  Definitely recommend Grimaldi pizza"}
{"text":"Suprised this has 3.5 stars out of 17 reviews. This is my favorite pizza in town. Crust is great- ask for the crust to be a little more done"}
{"text":"Grimaldis is awesome.  This location is as good as the other location from my experience.  The story goes this place is a chain started the first pizza place in New York.  It's a little different than you greasy cheesy pizza we all grey up with.  The only complaint about here is that it is pricey for pizza but it is real good.  Come here if you want great coal fired thin crust pizza.  Order more than you think, it goes down quick."}
{"text":"Love, Love , LOVE Grimaldi's.  Now being that I am a native NY'er, this is not the pizza I grew up eating.  That's ok though...Grimaldi's is different but great.  This San Tan location is the only one I will go to as well.  They do the pizza just the way I like it; the perfect amount of sauce (other locations have lacked in this area), the cheese is ample and bubbly and the whole pizza is always cooked to perfection.   Salads are always good and plentiful and the calzones are enormous!!  This location can be VERY busy so go early, but not too early as they stoke the ovens late afternoon.  There is a nice patio that I love to sit at during lunch hours.  The only downside to Grimaldi's is that they are very limited in the reservations that they will take; only 1 per hour.  Yes, you read that right.  Not sure what the logic is there but it has caused some problems for my parties in the past.  Ultimately though, Grimaldi's is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I love thin-crust pizza, I love fine cheese, and I love Grimaldi's.  Vegas is not known for having great pizza, especially off the strip, which is why it's to the fortune of Vegas diners that we have an authentic pizza import from Brooklyn.  I'm a fan of crispy crust with a coal brick-oven toasty taste, thus Grimaldi's crust is probably one of my favorite.  The house sauce is flavorful, not overwhelming.  For a treat, I always order the pesto sauce, which tastes of fresh basil every time.  Their meaty toppings (sausage, pepperoni, etc.) are very good so if you are a traditional pizza eater, I suggest the sausage with roasted sweet peppers.  The only drawback is: toppings are $2-$4 each so the price can stack up quickly for a regular-ingredients pie.  However, if you're in the mood for a different palette, order the pesto sauce with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes, and grilled chicken.  I find that this combination puts together an absolutely delicious gourmet pizza seldom found elsewhere.  Fresh basil pesto, slightly sweet & lavish ricotta, top-quality sun-dried tomatoes, and tender grilled chicken always win me over at first bite."}
{"text":"Pizza was a little spicy this time . The waiter was very good..Will return on our next trip to Arizona."}
{"text":"I try going to this Grimaldis over and over again because the pizza is soooo good, but their customer service and cleanliness stinks. I called to make a reservations for a large party and they put me on hold for a while to tell me they were full! Waiting more than an hour to get a table and the hostesses just seemed soooo out of it! One bathroom, long wait for that too and super dirty, a guy even came out of the woman's bathroom!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets for sure, what can I say about this place besides that it is my favorite pizza of all time hands down (: If you have never had it, try it! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza done with just the right amount of cheeses, sauce and crust that never disappoints with quality food at a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok, I've had much better coal-fired pizza. It was busy though. Seems like a popular place."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming a favorite pizza stop.  We have been to a couple different Grimaldi's recently and we've not been disappointed.  Good New York style pie and wine selection.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. I come here quite often. For starters we usually start of with the spinach salad which is amazing!! For pizza we order a half pepperoni and half black olive. Just found out today that they have a full bar now... Thank you!! I usually order the red sangria which is delicious! Only disappointment was the coffee...they don't offer refills?"}
{"text":"Speechless.  Grimaldi's left me speechless.  Since I left NYC, finding great pizza has been a challenge and a mission for me.  I have my short list of favorites in LA but I heard about Grimaldi's and took advantage of the opportunity when I was in Las Vegas.  This is stunningly good pizza that would stand with the best in NYC.  What confounds me is that Grimaldi's is a chain (based on the Brooklyn original).  Until now, great pizza bordered on artistry.  Somehow, Grimaidi's figured out how to break down the process resulting in the execution of consistently amazing pies.  Wow!  They have coal ovens, access to hard-to-find ingredients like bufalo mozzarella and they didn't look at me strangely when I asked for a margherita pie: a real pizzeria.  I love the thought of Grimaldi's expanding to cities where decent pizza cannot be found and where low-rent chains like Domino's are put out of business."}
{"text":"We live 5 minutes from this location. We've ordered probably a pizza every other week for ages. In fact it's our neighborhood pizza place. This review isn't really about the pizza - the pizza is pretty darn good - it's about some ridiculous policy I was told about today and how poorly they decided to treat their regulars simply because it is New Year's Eve.   I have two kids. It's just my kids and I this NYE at home because hubby is working (in food and beverage so I KNOW how busy it can be). Knowing they are likely to be busy, I call shortly after 5 to order a plain cheese pizza to pick up. That's the extent of my order, about as easy as you can get right??    The girl answering the phone says \"we won't be making any to go orders until after 830 tonight, is that OK?\"  Stunned, I say no, of course it's not ok ( if I wanted a pizza at 9 pm I would not be calling st 5).  I ask why?  Well, she says, it's because they have reservations tonight and they will be busy on NYE. How does that even make sense?  Don't they normally have reservations?  Isn't the point - at least in part - of reservations is to regulate the flow of orders so it's reasonable and all customers will be served?  In my experience, it should actually be busier later in the evening as people who are out for the holiday (and don't have young kids to feed ) will be dining at normal times of 7 ish. As it gets later, staff will be more anxious to get out of there as well. There are so many other ways to handle this if they don't think they can hack it on NYE - limit the size of orders, offer less options for pick up, acknowledge wait times may be longer, etc. Whatever. Stupid policy. Crappy way to treat a neighborhood regular. Happy New Year Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Great pizza! No complaints at all on the food!  So-so service :( Waitress forgot our order, didn't acknowledge it, didn't offer to recover the service in any way.  Improve the service and you would have a lifetime customer..."}
{"text":"Meh. My friends really wanted to try this out after reading \"best pizza\" signs and hearing great things. My favorite food is pizza so I of course was down for it.   To start I had a passion fruit tea, MMM!  A large ceasar salad for four of us. It was a really good salad. -then my friend found a hair in hers. :/  We ordered a small half pesto/white pizza with chicken and artichokes and a small sausage and mushroom. I liked the pesto the best. The others were aiite... And they don't have ranch for your pizza because the chef thinks it destroys the taste of the pizza. I was not amazed or even really satisfied with the meal.  Our server was really nice though and the cook gave us a $5 gift card for the hair in the salad to use next time except we don't live near a restaurant so she said we could use it for that visit which was nice.   I wouldn't come here again necessarily if I were visiting again. If it were up to me I would try something new or trusty round table or mountain mikes."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very excited when Grimaldi's Pizzeria opened their location in Boca Park. We have gone there several times since they opened and to say our experience has been a mixed bag is an understatement. Over time we have become dyed in the wool pizza snobs. We look for the best pizza where ever we travel and have learned a lot about what goes into a great pie. We especially like wood and coal fired oven pizzas so we knew Grimaldi's would be right up our alley.  I've had a few very good pies at Grimaldi's and I've had a couple of questionable experiences.    On our first couple of trips to Grimaldi's we ordered pepperoni pizza and wine. The pies were well made with a nice char on the crust as one would expect from a coal fired pizza. The service was quick and very friendly. We were definitely satisfied with our visits early on. On a subsequent visit things got a little funny. We hadn't tried a margherita style pizza at Grimaldi's so we decided that that would be the order of the day. Now mind you the Vegas location doesn't have margherita as choice on their menu, but it's a pretty simple traditional pie. It's just sauce, mozzarella and basil. Pretty straight forward, right? So I thought. Upon asking for a margherita pizza I was given an explanation about east coast margherita vs. west coast margherita and how each is made. His whole east coast/ west coast thing made me forget we were discussing pizza and had me believing the conversation had turned to hip-hop music. East coast/ west coast? Really??!! It was obvious that instead of telling me he didn't know what a margherita pizza our server wanted to b.s. me. At this point he suggested that we try both pies. Against my better judgment I went along with him. Needless to say, both pies were wrong. The most interesting of the two pies was the east coast pie which did have basil on it: about $40 worth! Since that experience I have made a trip to Brooklyn and went to the original Grimaldi's where they knew exactly what a Margherita pizza is. Must be some sort of disconnect between the mothership and franchises.    With all of that being said Grimaldi's does serve a good pie and is worth the trip. The serve is always good and the wine list has some nice choices as well. Just remember, if you want a margherita pizza write down the instructions on how it's made! East coast or west coast!!"}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place another try since it's been nearly a year since my last unfavorable pizza here.  Maybe its just me having bad luck since this place gets so many rave reviews, but once again the large sausage pizza that I was staring at seemed to be a bare crust totally devoid of any toppings.  I understand that this place prides itself on its crust, but c'mon adding a few toppings won't kill it!  Virtually no cheese, tiny spots of sauce here and there, and very sparse little crumbles of sausage that must have been begrudgingly added.  I was at least smart enough to take home about half of it, since I remembered I had some left over Spinato's at home.  I took a slice of Spinato's and put it on top of the Grimaldi's \"crust pizza\" and when I re-heated it I finally had pizza the way its supposed to be! Spinato's ample delicious toppings on top of Grimaldi's coal fired \"platform\" was very tasty indeed!"}
{"text":"boy oh boy! i read these reviews and i can tell you what is wrong with the people knocking this place.. let me ive you a back ground of me 1st. i am 100% italian, i am from new york, lived there all my life just moved out here 2 years ago, new york by the way best pizza anywhere! now back to the reviews, most of the people that are telling you the pizza is horrible are spanish people that have no idear what real pizza taste like, who think pizza hut, cesar's, and all the mexican pizza is the best pizza in the world, ill listen to there reviews when i want to know about a mexican food. some other people who are not spanish but germans, irish, or some other nationality, please!!!!!!, you don't know italian food, and don't act like you know! then you have the others, italians who think they know pizza, but there not from new york or chicago, and never ever been to italy, these are what we real italians call then americans 4th generations, so please dont call your selves italians, if you or your parents are not from italy, even though i was born here my parents are from italy and have alot of family members there as well, i speak it and write it that is why my writing is not great i know that. now this is what i think of this place, is the pizza the best i ever had, no, but it is very good, dose it compare to new york city pizza, no, but it is the best so far i tasted in vegas! and trust me folks i went to alot of pizza places and there most of it garbage! but this place is best so far! sry i sounded rude, but these people with these reviews are killing me, it is like i have no idear to be a doctor and writing reviews on how to be one...."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Vegas -- and I had a college reunion with friends this past weekend. One of the girls organized a dinner at this restaurant (since we all experienced the real first Grimaldi's in NYC) on Friday evening, 8:30 pm.  Since we've all had Grimaldi's before (in Brooklyn), it wasn't anything \"new\" or exciting. It was more like - we're checking this place out to see if it tastes the same?  My husband and I ordered a large pizza (almost couldn't finish!) with these toppings: pepperoni mushroom anchovies extra basil  YUM; it was huge and it was good. Not as good as I remembered it when we had the real thing in Brooklyn about 5 years ago; but it worked. We were hungry too since dinner was so late.  We also ordered a small mediterranean salad $8 (feeds 2); refreshing and good way to couple it up with our pizza. :)   Our total bill was $32 for the pizza + salad. Quality pizza, good food, but probably wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"A great pie   I'm originally from NY, and it's always a challenge to find a great NY style Italian Pie. I have eaten lots of pies at  Grimaldi's original location under the Brooklyn Bridge, and I have  to say this Grimaldi's has equally great pies.  We arrived at 11:00 after watching a movie and we were seated within minutes. Our server took our drink order, and the drinks were delivered quickly. On this visit we kept it simple, a small pepperoni, double cheese pizza.  The small pizza is enough for two people (16\"). The  pizzas are thin crust, crispy, and  delicious.  We were filled from our pizza, but  we couldn't pass up desert. So  we went with  the \"trio\" for desert.  You pick any three deserts off the menu. We tried the Tiramisu, Oreo cookie cheesecake, and Cannoli. My favorites was the cannoli. Grimaldi's has great food, service, and staff, which always keepd me coming back."}
{"text":"Does anybody else think it's weird to have an Italian restaurant inside the mall?  I was in between going to their location in the Palazzo and this one...I went here instead, thinking there would be less of a wait, plus it was closer to my hotel.  There was no wait.  The service was great...our server was very knowledgeable about pizza and the history of Grimaldi's.  The pizza was good.  But my friend told me to go here b/c she said it was the best pizza she's ever had.  I wouldn't go that far...but it was good."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place! It's a great atmosphere, the employees are super nice and friendly, and the pizza is amazing! I like the cheese pizza- it doesn't have cheese on every inch and it's absolutely to die for! Perfect amount of cheese. I recommend this place if you don't mind spending a little extra for amazing quality."}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean salad. I recommend it. The meatball calzone was so-so. The house chianti made up for what the calzone lacked. Ambiance was very comforting though. I would comeback and try the pizza."}
{"text":"The service was hands on and excellent. waiter & runner were very helpful with there most order items in the menu. And also I had really good personality's and sparked up conversation which made are lunch more enjoyable. I will definitely keep that place in mind and go again."}
{"text":"Solid Margherita Pizza, nice, prompt friendly service, right by the fashion show. We didn't make it to the original Grimaldi's Pizza location in NYC and were looking for something in Vegas, so we decided to give this place a go. It turns out it it is owned by the cousins of the original Grimaldi's who split off and opened this one. Our server told up they use the same dough and sauce recipe, but have an expanded menu. They do make their own desserts including cheese cake and have a selection of wine and cocktails, as well as some salads. We enjoyed our simple Marg pizza. There are plenty of topping options (for and additional $2-$5 each) so you could easily build your own $50 pizza! We kept it simple which worked well with the thin NYC style crust. I have a hard time believing that this Grimaldi's equals the NYC location that has lines for days; we enjoyed our pizza but not enough to wait hours for it! Like most other things in Vegas it is an imitation, rarely as good as the original!"}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations coming to this location, and they were mostly upheld, but I wanted better. The pizza was pretty solid, but the service was lacking a little bit. I showed up earlier than the rest of my party on Thursday for lunch so I sat at the bar and drank an ice cold glass of water after a morning round of golf. I heard a manager talking, saying he was \"giving this table of first-timers a comped order of canolis\"  When we were seated we went outside, and it was beautiful out so that was great. The hostess offered \"iced tea, water, or maybe a Peroni\" She didn't ask us if it was our first time, offer to describe the menu and their prices or try to upsell anything like an appetizer or garlic bread or salads. We decided to split a large and the ladies in the group were gonna split a small pizza, and the small is still plenty to share. The girls also decided to split a small caesar salad. We ordered and everything went normal. The pizza took a little longer than I anticipated being a very thin crust and the very beginning of lunch hour, but came out nicely proportioned with plenty of meatballs and onions on one, and plenty of ricotta cheese and pepperonis on the other. The pepperoni was nice and spicy, and the meatballs are full of flavor and nice and large too. When it came time to ask if everything was going well, clear the plates, get us our checks and get the hell out of there is where the service lacked. Our server disappeared for a good 10-12 minutes when we were done eating and it took a long time to get the check and clear the credit card back to us to sign.  One of the other things that bugs me about Grimaldis is that each topping is at least $2-4 and the personal cheese pizza starts at $10 and the large at $18. If you get a large with 2 toppings you're already looking at $24+ just for a pizza. Add two drinks and a salad and you're looking at $45 with a tip for a lunch.  Also, what kinda place doesn't serve ranch? We asked for a side of ranch to dip the crust in when the pizza came and she said they don't even serve it at this restaurant. With salad on the menu how do you not serve ranch? This is America right? We love our ranch dressing. Disappointing 3 stars, I'll probably try it again, but probably not too soon since it's about 25 mins away from my house"}
{"text":"First, I have to disclose that I am a huge pizza fan and I prefer Italian food to everything but a good steak.  I visited the one in Palazzo shops.  loved this place!  The service was quick, charming and friendly.  The atmosphere and view from the dining room was awesome overlooking the Wynn.  But the best part was the Pizza, Thin crust, huge pizza for about 20 bucks on the strip???!!!!  Wow! The only change I would make is offer more variety with the apps.  But other than that, I will make it a point to revisit once or twice a year when I am in Vegas.  As you can tell I really liked this place and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes good thin crust pizza.  Mgmt got it right here, good decor, atmosphere, service and food."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE this pizza! The thin crust just melts in your mouth and the cheese is delish. We order the double cheese, fresh tomatoes and basil, but the white sauce with chicken and roasted red peppers is pretty awesome as well. Every time we are in Arizona we can't stay away from this place and everyone we've taken has really enjoyed it as well. I think the Scottsdale location has a much better atmosphere, but the pizza is consistently good at either location."}
{"text":"Have always been ny favorite place for pizza, great ambience for a nice family dinner"}
{"text":"Love the pizza but curbside service is atrocious. I waited 20 minutes for an order I put in a few hours before and the attendant didn't care at all. Just came out once with my salad and said that the pizza will be out in a second...10 minutes later it came out. Not even an apology"}
{"text":"So, I went to Grimaldi's (DUMBO - BROOKLYN) in February 2013 after walking from Ground Zero all the way across the Brooklyn Bridge (I was hungry to say the least).  I'll spare you the details, but it was average at best - terrible service, tourist-trap kinda place.  Not horrible, but definitely not great.  Flash forward to July 2013 - Las Vegas.  I was looking for a killer pizza place in Vegas (staying at The Mirage) and decided to find it with a little help from my friends (yes, I saw LOVE and had Beatles music on my mind).  Yelp says, \"Grimaldi's.\"  Hmmm, do I try the place at the Aria (Five50) or give Grimaldi's another shot?  The Yelp reviews for Grimaldi's were too good to dismiss (and it was just across the street at the Palazzo).  Okay Grimaldi's, don't let me down.  Let's get right to the details...very nice atmosphere, outstanding pizza and excellent service!  Our waiter, Victor was amazing!  He recommended the pie, served us with a smile, was efficient, professional and just a very nice person.  Oh yeah, the meatball, ricotta and sweet red pepper pizza was out of this world!  Dang, what an awesome pizza-eating experience!  Grimaldi's Las Vegas IS the pizza place on The Strip!  Thank you Grimaldi's AND Victor (you were awesome!)  Can't wait to get back and do another meatball pizza..."}
{"text":"A large pizza is definitely big enough to share for 2.I think it has something to do with the density if the base.. Even though it is a thin and crispy base.. It tastes like it is thick and dense.. It's just really filling! And although it was burnt and oily it was still so so tasty.. We got ours with pepperoni, mushroom and onion and the tomato based sauce they use is yummo.. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Grimaldis pizza is always good. They are expensive however, but if you sign up online they give you a free large pizza for your birthday. They have a nice atmosphere and their pizza is delicious. I personally love their ricotta cheese and meatball pizza the most."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are both good, but this location (DC Ranch) has some fundamental problems with it's service.  It is very disorganized and there is poor communication among the staff.   Tonight there was preferential treatment given to another party ( I think money exchanged hands previously, or it was just a very awkward handshake I witnessed ), which caused my party to wait longer.  It was embarrassing when we were escorted to the table that was sat with the party who came in after was and we were told we had to keep waiting.  It was obvious what had happened.  The manager handled the situation the best he could but the entire ordeal was frustrating and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"For a faux NYC pizzeria in Vegas, I will give it my props.   First off, the atmosphere is really cute, with subway signs and light fixtures shaped like bottles. The food is almost exclusively salad/pizza/calzone, but it's all pretty reasonably priced. Even a 12\" pizza is a decent lunch for 2 people and is $20. We got the Brooklyn Bridge, which has roasted red peppers, ricotta cheese, and sausage. It was a winning combination! The crust had a nice crispiness to it and loaded with flavor.  The service was good too. The waiter said \"the Don\" which looks like a pizza any meat lover would devour, was the most popular, and it was tempting. He also gave me a to-go cup of water which was nice compared to buying water in the casino. He even served us up the first two slices, which was not as good for my picture taking, but nice for service.  I liked it enough to look up their NYC location. Spoilers, they don't have one. They do have a lot more locations than I expected, so I'd definitely come back to one of those if I come across them."}
{"text":"My wife loves their pizza, so there's four stars automatically.  But that's where we stop.  Too much inter-employee BS going on and not enough looking after the customer.  And the floor manager (guess that's what he was, he sure wasn't helping anybody) needs to go to attitude school.  We were lucky - very nice waitress.  But you have to wonder when she's talking to the table next to us, telling them she's looking for another job where she can make some money.  And, oh, yeah...they're believers in the \"use a tiny carafe to serve the wine - it looks like they're getting more\" school."}
{"text":"We've tried to come eat here twice and both times told the ovens were being cleaned and it would be an hour to hour and half for food. I saw tables with customers eating hot food so I don't understand...Seems like they need to re-evaluate their stoking times as there were multiple parties being turned away."}
{"text":"Now this is what I call new York style pizza- thin crust that you can fold and enjoy. Ordered the house salad which was good enough for two.  Created my own pizza with the white sauce and garlic, spinach and anchovies.  Delicious!  A bit pricy for a small pizza and costs 2.00 each topping but worth to try at least once.  I'm a garlic person and you can really taste the garlic in the sauce with each bite.  Satisfied and if I'm in town I would go here again."}
{"text":"We love this pizza!  It's thin, with very light sauce and cheese - just enough for perfection.  The calzone is also quite tasty, deliciously thin crust packed with flavor and delicious ricotta-rich inner cheese - don't forget to ask for extra sauce (it comes on the side).    Tons of seating and a cute atmosphere - especially on the patio!  Their takeout system is pretty great -  usually, a server runs out to you if you pull your car around the back, bringing pizza and taking your payment."}
{"text":"Overall, the experience was positive, although I would give it 3.5 stars if that were an option. The wait at this location is ALWAYS lengthy, and the food is not so good that it feels worthwhile. The hostess team on 11-29-14 seemed particularly ill-prepared to seat people efficiently, and they were thoroughly confused when our name was called.  Our table for two was ready. . . . but it really wasn't. . . . After more waiting, we were offered a table outside (which is precisely what we asked not to have); we took it because we were hungry. On the positive side, the manager did seem to try to please guests on a busy night, and our server was extremely pleasant and attentive. (I wish I could remember her name) The pizza was very tasty, and our salad was also good.  Beverages were refilled promptly throughout the evening. The bread leaves a lot to be desired; far below the offerings of other mid-scale Italian establishments. Again, 3 stars seems harsh, but 4 may be a bit generous in light of the wait and confusion leading up to our being seated."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Great drinks. I had the kale chopped salad which was delicious. We got a white pizza. The crust is very nice. Strawberry basil smash was absolutely fantastic! My friend got the watermelon mule and loved it. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We have a Grimaldi's in NYC & this was my first visit to one. It was delicious. We had cold antipast to start with a Mediterranean salad which was pretty good. We ordered a pie with black olives, a meatball & pepperoni pie & then a white personal pie. All very good & the bill was close to $100.00. We also saw Tommy LaSorda who is a regular there & he was such a sweetheart. He came over to talk with us & take pictures. So if you're a big baseball fan - you may see him here."}
{"text":"Order pizza to go asked for large she said 16 with any topping u want b4 i pick up total was 34.00 with out telling me and didnt help me me no thanx bad service they dont care"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!  The service was amazing!  Fun, open-air atmosphere. The kids loved watching the pizzas being made and the dough being thrown.  Will definitely go there next time we're visiting."}
{"text":"Very good!!  Was referred to Grimaldi's for their pizza and it did not disappoint.  Ordered a simple meatball with onions and mushrooms and was happy I did!  The crust and toppings were great!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Jamison was really attentitive to our needs and had a great personality. Food was very good and enjoyed my cappuccino. Customer service was also great. Will definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Nice pizza joint in the Palazzo. I wouldn't call it a little hole in the wall. It's pretty fancy looking for a simple pizza joint.  I wasn't a fan of their white pie, but the standard red sauce pie, definitely tasty."}
{"text":"If you actually look at my reviews you will find that I have reviewed many local places and given them high marks.  This place is the exception.  Walking in and the bartender was coughing into his hands and touching pizza boxes with pizzas already in them and pouring drinks and touching receipts.  Disgusting.  The pizza itself was below average.  Decent crust but very few toppings and the sauce is done in their signature way where they put round dollops of sauce every so often on the crust instead of everywhere.  I'll take everywhere.  There was nothing but crust in several spots, bland as hell, and lame.  We were grossed out by the bartender and couldn't hardly eat anyways but we actually gave it a try.  I will never spend another dime in this location."}
{"text":"It's been more than 18 months since my last review.  Sorry to be redundant, but Grimaldi's continues to be one of the best pizzas in town.  And the line of people waiting to be seated confirms I'm not the only one who thinks so.  Expect a 20-30 minute wait most times.  I do wish they'd put a little more sauce on the pizza.  You don't want to drown it, but a bit more would be good.  Service is still good, too.  I keep coming back when I want pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious!  We started with the kale salad which is my favorite.  The kale is very mild and even the kids like it.  I don't care for sun dried tomatoes but they are very good in this salad.  We ordered 2 small pizzas for 4 of us and there were a few slices left over.  I don't think it reheats especially well so I didn't take the remainder to go.  The hostess was polite and our server Jameson was attentive.  Grimaldis is definitely a favorite place and we will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We have been here many times and love their white with garlic pizza.  They have the smaller but thcker pepperoni.  Since it is think crust (and delicious), you will eat more slices than you are used to.  They have great salads as well.  I haven't had their cheesecake but they looked really tempting.  Don't eat too much pizza if you want to try their dessert.  We've been to 3 locations in Vegas and the Palazzo one has the best ambiance vs Fashion Show & the Henderson locations."}
{"text":"Went for lunch one afternoon, decent patio (I'm not a fan of high tables I'm only 5' tall and have a hard time being comfortable). Pizza was good, sangria was terrible bad white wine with canned fruit cocktail is what it tasted like, it even had the metallic after taste. Mediterranean Salad was very tasty. I would go again for a weeknight dinner or lunch. But pass on the sangria."}
{"text":"Saturday  11/18/17  9:44 PM  I prefer this location over our location in Summerlin reason being Boca Park has the most congested parking lot with dips in the road and never any parking spots!  Our server was Samara was a complete sweetheart.  She was the best server anyone could of asked for.  She was so patient and gave a a few minutes to decide our appetizer (Large Antipasto $14).  It had roasted red pep, green olives, kalamata olives, mozzarella, salami and prosciutto!   Our pizza was the $25 Brooklyn pizza with  roasted red peppers, Italian sausage, creamy ricotta, and mozzarella cheese.  $6 Oreo cheesecake was to die for but it's very thick and sweet so share it!  Sign up for their emails and they will send a free pizza for your birthday week!"}
{"text":"Horribly rude customer service. I was greeted by both a man and a woman with horrible manners, who would not hold a conversation. The girl walked away after two minutes of trying to acquire a table.   Left because of the two people up front, lost five lifetime customers."}
{"text":"I don't know why I have never reviews this place before.... I have been coming here since it opened. With that being said I obviously like it here. The food is always great! I sit at the bar and specifically come to see Kurt! He remembers names and what everyone drinks. I literally call before going to make sure he is working. Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Was cruising through the Scottsdale area and was looking for a good dinner place.  Place was busy, but the wait time wasn't unreasonable.  Ordered blood orange iced tea.  No free refills on this special, was bummed I wasn't told this before hand.  It was okay tasting, I should have just gotten the regular.  They have specialty pizzas that all sounded pretty delicious.  We had a hard time picking, so we opted to make our own.  We were seated next to the oven and could see them making the pizzas.  Was entertaining and smelled amazing. Pizza was delicious.  Thin crust usually isn't my scene, but this was pretty damn good.  Our server was pretty attentive, funny. Towards the end he sorta disappeared, and it took awhile to get our check.  However, the overall experience was great and we wouldn't mind visiting again."}
{"text":"Soggy wet pizza and medium cooked veggies.  Best part was the crust. Very fresh ingredients but was bland.  Also why is the tomato sauce drizzle on top of toppimg?"}
{"text":"This was some damn good pizza. We were in town from Chicago and looking for some pizza to bring back to the room to watch the Irish. Lucky for us Grimaldi's was right down the road. We perused their menu for a bit and put together our combination. Which you pretty much have to do as they have only three to choose from: plain, pesto or white. I'd like to see them have some creative combos, instead of nickel and diming you for the toppings you are bound to add. That said we opted for garlic, sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms. The pizza came out pretty quick and we hurried off to chow and watch the game. It certainly could have been hotter, but I put that on us. The pizza was great and the crust was fantastic. They had gone into this elaborate story of how they mimic NYC water to get the perfect crust. It must be the truth, because it was damn good. Slightly charred, chewy and crusty. It held up well to the generous heaping of toppings they laid on us. It could have used a bit more sauce, but really I'm not going to add that as a topping. Pretty tasty pie and we put a beat down on it like the Irish put on Nevada."}
{"text":"Tried there pizza  a month ago I can say I will not be going back because the pizza I got didn't taste good too me I'm just wondering where did the cheese go when they cooked it in the oven brick  lol"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! Fresh ingredients, great service, and friendly staff. The pepperoni they use is to die for and if you sit at the bar make sure Kurt is working super friendly guy  pizza so good I had leftovers.. And I never eat leftovers"}
{"text":"Pricey BUT we will pay $$$ for great pizza. So...Shockingly Bad!  And who is posting 5 star comments for at least this Old Town Location?  Any frozen pizza out of the box warmed at home would win in a taste test. What happened to the pizza dough? I haven't posted in a while because I get disillusioned by the non foodie posts. But this needs to be done. TAKE A LOOK AT THE PIZZA WHEN YOU WALK IN BEFORE ORDERING!     We first visited Gramaldis in New Jersey in '07 and it was FANTASTIC!  It Tied with Joes on Bleeker St in our personal taste test. We were delighted to try Grimaldis  again 3 years ago at Kierland when visiting Scottsdale. It was not like NJ, but pretty good.   Last night we went again to Old Town. We sat at the bar and the service was good. We ordered the green salad. Terrible. No taste in the dressing. It seemed like it had vegetable oil and maybe a squeeze of lemon. Anyway. No flavor. Than our pizza showed up. Flat, thin, flimsy, and just awful. I'm sorry We ate any of it but we were hungry.   There is no way we will go back. This was not a fluke because all pizzas we saw going by (they were busy) looked the same. No thicker fluffy edge, no slightly charred look, no crispness. No chewy bite. Nothing.  We got back to our room and knew we should have stayed in and just had popcorn rather than eat those tasteless calories. Sad. Moral. Stick with the originals or the Mom and Pop places that still can manage the process. And the recipes."}
{"text":"I love good food, this includes pizza, and I find that I'm a pizza/food agnostic/nazi. Chicago deep dish \"pie\" style, crispy new york style... theres something good in all of them. Rustic or high tech, I enjoy it all. I just cant stand thoughless preparation of meals, that would be the \"Hard liner\" in me. Not to worry, Grimaldi's delivers in every way that matters! From entering on a Sunday evening, everyone was honestly warm in their greeting, chatting about the day etc.  From the tea which was perfect (Mine basic non-sweetened, and The Brides Passion fruit wonderfulness, both were simple, basic and perfect for the meal) Both of us were expecting leftovers, so we opted for a small salad each, knowing that the portions were huge, I just wanted a Greek style salad, while the Bride had zero desire for feta/olives etc so opted for a house salad. So two small *SNORT SMALL!* salads were brought to out table... sheesh! Not so much small as only a buffet on a plate!  My Medeteranion salad was very good, I admit it was blander than I like, Lots of feta, (YAY) however I had asked for extra, and they sure delivered! Strangely enough, the feta was blander than I'm used to, which caught me by surprise. Still creamy and tart, very welcome indeed.  Also, No onions on the salad? I'm sure it was an over site, next time I'll ask for extra onions, (a silly for onions!)  Or a different salad, I tried The Brides house salad and the flavor's were a wonderful balance, the roasted peppers really added a lot of flavors.. smoky/sweet, just wonderfully clean and fresh. On   And then.. to the pizza. So pretty! It's so rare that you look at a \"lowly\" pizza and see the level of care that went into its construction. We opted for a classic first time benchmark. Pepperoni, sausage, onions with fresh garlic. I usually avoid garlic, but The Bride wanted it, and since it was fresh and not garlic powder, I was open to it. The garlic was quite good, however it wasn't really needed on the pie.The fresh basil, which tasted fresh from the garden, was lovely, and I would order more of that instead of garlic next time. (and possibly meatballs). The crust was this with a good chew. Mozzarella cheese was fresh and NOTHING like the shredded crap you can get at Costco etc.  You can tell the placing of the toppings was done with care, evenly dispensed, but not uniform,  It was without a doubt the best sausage I've had in decades. And the pepperoni was flavorful, although the thick cut did make the texture a tad different, I'm told it was a slicer issue, and not the usual preparation method.    We had a great chat with our server about the restaurant and how it's been going over, also Jennifer who seems to be a manager came over and chatted for a bit, very nice, laid back and fun.   If your in a hurry, and planning a eary dinner, late lunch, I recommend calling first, since the charcoal over requires cheaning once during the day, and it's unable to cook for around a hour or so, so you might want to avoid that period. Also, as a earlier Yelper commented they do not use gloves when making crust, as someone who was a cook in my youth I'm amazed, I mean, making a pizza with rubber gloves? Talk about overkill, and a pain in the rear! Your trusting them to touch your food in other ways, i don't see the issue. Also, the oven gets to 1000% so I'm not worried about anything nasty making it out of there, if anything, I don't want the flavor of melted plastic on my Za! (and I'm not such a germaphobe that I fear chefs touching my food, if I wanted a conveyor belt style meal.. no shortage of options around here.   Pro: Great, classic New York pizza, epic portions, extraordinary pride taken in providing a premium product. with quick, efficient, good natured, prideful service. Passion fruit tea was the best I've ever had.  And We were informed by Jennifer (a manager of some sort i gather) that you can order your pizza like a steak. rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, well done.... all giving different levels of crunch to the dough and toppings etc.  Next time we are going to try playing with that aspect... perhaps some extra cheese and go medium or medium well? Get a tad more of the charcoal crustiness to it.  Con: Limited menu, I know, that a place like this would make a killer meatball & Spagetti, or sandwich! I appreciate the total focus on making the perfect pie... but when the farthest afield they go is a Calzone .. well they are almost rainman level focused! (take it  thats a complement, I'm just greedy, I admit it. The meditiranian salad was blander than expected. They use the same dressing for this salad as for the house salad. Yes, feta helps, but some peperoncini and Greek dressing, would be nice. Next time, I'll either try the Cesare or antipasto, or skip that course. (And a little bread, just pizza dough with s with the salad would be nice). Gimmick or not, the water tastes great! Almost worth not getting a drink and enjoying the delicious aqua!"}
{"text":"This is the second Grimaldi's location I have been to. What brought me here was a coupon. $5 off $25 or more is a great coupon when a small pizza starts at $14 or $16. The prices are a tad high but unless you eat slice after slice, a small is fine for two people.  I ordered a small cheese pizza with basil. The pizza is good and for a chain it's real good. However, the basil was wilted and tasted bitter. The tomato sauce is also bland and on the sweeter side. It just needs more seasoning and probably more time to cook. They also need to get their basil from a better source because the basil was weak.   Prices are high for the execution but at least you know what to expect.   Four stars because the customer service exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I ordered the regular pizza with basil, I kept it simple because I wanted to see what their pie tasted like without other ingredients getting in the way and also adding extra ingredients is outrageous. I made the mistake of ordering the basil cooked into the pizza per recommendation. The dough was fine but once you hit the crust it was extremely hard to chew,the mozzarella had a plastic like consistency, and the tomato sauce didn't have much flavor. Overall it was a decent pizza but many of the small important details were overlooked."}
{"text":"Continuing with my belated Vegas reviews... we stopped at Grimaldi's after chatting with some people carrying pizza boxes. They were raving about this place and we were looking for a good place to grab a bite in the Venetian, so we went. We ordered a white pizza with artichoke hearts, jalapenos, spicy chicken sausage and onions. Each topping was an additional cost (there was no such option for 1 or 2 free toppings plus extra for any additional) so the pizza was a bit pricey but DAMN IT WAS GOOD. Well, it was a tad spicy for me so I had to pick off some of the jalapeno slices but mmm. The crust was light and airy and the combination of all the toppings was perfect. I don't normally go for white pizzas but I just may in the future.  Service was fast, which us five hungry girls very much appreciated."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money! Worst pizza place ever Very expensive and got home the order was wrong. I should have went to Blaze! Same pizza for 1/4 the price. Feeling ripped off"}
{"text":"We have been looking for good pizza joint but not  fancy and stuffy restaurants in 5 stars hotels. We found it. Great service and friendly staff. You have to come for pizza"}
{"text":"Becoming a fire trap. The owners have gotten greedy and moved so many tables into the restaurant that in the event of a fire....you will probably not get out. The tables are now so close that if people are sitting at the next table.....someone at your table has to get up and move the table so that other people at your table can get out. With baby seats and extra chairs lined up against the wall........this is becoming a dangerous situation.  They have made this worse by assigning waitresses to certain table/sections so that one section can be completely packed and another have almost no one in it.   This used to be a very nice place to eat and the pizza was great. However the new crowded conditions make it unpleasant. I hate sitting at my table and being so close to the next table that they are included in your conversation and you in theirs."}
{"text":"THEY ONLY SERVE PIZZA and salad.  Thin crust pizza made to order with generous portion of toppings.  Plenty of seating and parking.  Super friendly staff.  If you hate thin crust, then this ain't the place for you.  The bonus is the frozen custard next door."}
{"text":"When I took my boyfriend on a culinary tour of Old Town for one of our date nights, Grimaldi's was the first stop. For good reason too! I am of the opinion that this is the best pizza in the Valley. And if you think that Pizzeria Bianco deserves that title then I have four words for you \"come at me bro!\"   I could tell that my boyfriend was skeptical when we walked into the restaurant. It is very typically Italian with red checkered table cloths and the like. However, this place could serve me pizza on any surface and I would still eat it!   We orded a Cesar salad, medium pizza with ricotta cheese and mushrooms, and a bottle of Riesling.  The salad was so-so. I mean, there isn't much you can do to tweak a Cesar salad. It is what it is. And this one was a great pre-dinner snack.  The pizza! Oh lord, the pizza! So delicious! I highly recommend putting ricotta cheese on anything that you order as it is melty and delicious. We ate the whole pizza between the two of us just because it was so damn good!   We visited Grimaldi's on a hot Tuesday night, so we got right in. I would suggest making reservations if you want to eat there on a weekend night or during the winter months. Overall, it is a great experience with fabulous service, food, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This review is a bit dated but I'll just share my experience and let others decide. Walking around in the Palazzo many moons ago my girlfriend and I came across Grimaldi's and it just so happened to be their opening night. We ordered a pizza (no surprise). The pizza was brought out (no surprise), we began to eat the pizza (no surprise), the pizza as not fully cook and the dough was partially still raw (big surprise). A gentlemen comes to our table and asks us how our pizza as; we inform him the pizza was still raw and not fully cooked. He apologizes as he just happened to be the owner (surprise). We pass on ordering any other menu items to replace the raw pizza. The bill comes to the table and we are charged for the raw pizza (big surprise). So the owner is present and sees the raw pizza and still charges us? Absolute last time I ever visited this establishment."}
{"text":"Pleasantly happy to see that there is a recent change with management at this location! We went there last night and WOW there sure was a visual difference.   We have been going to this location and watched the customer service and cleanliness decline over the past several months and decided to go and give it another try.  The pizza was delicious, servers friendly and helpful, and a professional manager working with his staff. Robert is making a difference!  We will be back for some more delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as a pizza aficionado. I have not found Arizona pizza that tops it. I swear to god Angels descended from the ceiling playing tiny joyous trumpets. Hands down the most amazing pizza that has ever entered my mouth. It's a little more on the pricey side, but all pizza lovers know that you gotta pay for pie. If you want cheap take your ass over to little c's. Quality, my friends, quality. Order the caesar salad as a starter and I promise your food journey will be a gift that keeps on giving."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've come across and that's saying a lot as places like NY and others in the AZ area have been tried, however Grimaldi's is the best hands down! And a perfect location in Scottsdale too?"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before and randomly found it on yelp.  It's located right of the 101 and was pretty easy to find once in the parking lot.  Go in the main enterance and turn right, you can't miss it.  The only crappy thing was finding parking near by.  The street parking was all taken and the dirt parking lot was so chaotic that people were parking in areas that were blocking other cars in.  But being willing to walk just a few feet extra and you'll find parking.  There was plenty of seating outside and and equal amount inside.  I went on a friday night and was seated right away.  I ordered a pretty plain cheese pizza but it was delicious.  The only down side was it felt like forever that it took to make and bring us our personal pan pizzas.  Once we had them things were good.  I would have no problem returning here and getting more delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I still love Grimaldi's pizza, but some of their staff could definitely use an attitude check.  We last went during off hours, and the restaurant was relatively empty.  We were seated at a small 4-top in the middle of the room.  When we asked if we could sit at one of the empty tables by the window, the hostess told us no since we were a party of 4, and those tables were for 5.  Seriously?  All of the tables are empty.  We're talking one extra chair.  So of course when we ordered two pizzas and an appetizer, there was a space problem for the server.  As we were leaving, the hostess was advising another family they couldn't bring their stroller in because there wasn't enough space.  While that might hold true during busy times, there was plenty of space.  I can only assume this employee was working under management's policies.  Aside from that, I still think they have some of the best pizza around, although, we have gotten a soggy middle a few times since our first visit."}
{"text":"Suuuper dirty. Nice hole in the wall vibe inside, no smoking inside, but the ice was dirty... glass was dirty... and then the water also added black flecks to my prepackaged margarita (got a glass of ice, later added a splash of water to the margarita to help kick some of the sweetness) no liquor at the bar. Thin crust pizza was yummy, but we probably won't want to go in to order again. Staff was nice, bar patrons were all in a good mood- but the place was really dirty."}
{"text":"I used to manage pizza parlors when I was younger, so I have an eye for a good Pizza.  Grimaldi's is good stuff well made. I actually met the owner once several years ago.  Seems very nice.  But what you really care about is the food and that is well done with good service.  A little spendy but worth it."}
{"text":"The pizza tastes better cold than hot and it wasn't that good cold. I am a pizza aficionado and have tried hundreds so I have pretty high expectations which is probably why I do not agree with the majority of people on yelp. Nbd. I think Biaggios happened to to be better, but still not the best. Try it out, you might like it."}
{"text":"I don't really have a thorough review of this place because I came here on a Sunday. It's Sunday lunch time in Vegas - a few hours before flight departure. You should know how most people feel about Sundays in Vegas. My friend ordered the Margherita pizza and I thought it was okay. The sauce seemed really bland. I am not really a fan of pizza with bland pizza sauce. The pizza's dough didn't really grab at me either. The crust was thin and you can actually watch some of the staff toss pizza. I think the place is good about accommodating large groups and the staff are pretty chill. I also learned they do not have ginger ale but they can attempt to make ghetto ginger ale. The keyword is 'attempt' Ghetto ginger ale consists of Sierra Mist with a splash of pepsi. My friend who ordered this concluded does not taste like Ginger ale. Not really sure why they bother. They should flat out say no and not offer this option. I gave it three stars cause the staff was chill but really food wise I would give it two. I am not really all that intrigued to come back."}
{"text":"We stumbled over this place and decided to try it out. Very open layout and everyone was super friendly. The concept is pretty straight forward. You pick your size and sauce, then choose your toppings. I was a little anxious seeing some of the prices for toppings ($2 for pepperoni, $4 for Italian sausage etc), but after we received our order it made sense. The pizza was incredible, and the portions on it were generous. My wife could only eat 1 piece and out of sheer determination I ate 2 ( remember the sticker shock? I was determined to make it worth it!). After ordering the 18\" with 4 toppings (pepperoni, black olives, sundried tomatoes and Italian sausage) and 3 drinks our bill came out to ~$50. It was worth it, and we'll be back in the future"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is our favorite pizza, but they fell short today.  This is not a large pizza."}
{"text":"I don't know if I had a off experience or what but this pizza definitely is not the best in Vegas and is not worth the price. My husband agreed and he's not too picky. I was overcharged for extra meat I did not get. The pizza was cold and didn't seem \"freshly made\".  Not sure if the other pizzas are better but I'm not likely to return."}
{"text":"Nothing to rave about, but if in the neighborhood and in the mood for some pizza, I guess Grimaldi's would suffice. However, if you are looking for an AMAZING experience for pizza make your way to the secret pizza place at the Cosmopolitan (hands downs totally worth it!!!) Girmaldi's is a sit down restaurant with plenty of seating and towards the back of the restaurant you can see them making your pizza. Our waitor was friendly. Prices are reasonable as they offer the traditional pizza with their special sauce (regular red sauce), white with garlic, and pesto. They have a variety of toppings to select from ($2-4/each). The dough was nice and chewy but the pizza itself was bland. We ordered a large half red half white with pepperoni, chicken, artichoke, and olives. Their salads were good and large portions, would definitely recommend splitting. Probably won't be seeing you again Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Our first visit tonight, a Friday, and soooo not impressed.  Very loud, tight quarters.  Probably didn't help that we had a table in the corner by the back door with lots of kids running around.    Our \"small\" pizza for two took 40 minutes to arrive, and we purposely ordered quickly before several big parties were seated.  The pizza was extremely thin and the sauce was sweet.  We ordered ham as one of our 4 ingredients and it was \"diced.\"  I have never seen diced ham on a pizza, only in omelets.  It kept rolling off the pizza and not much cheese to hold it onto the crust.  We also ordered a mediterrean salad and it was ok.  Prices were reasonable, thus great for families.   Won't be going back anytime soon to this pizzeria that reminded me of one grade above a Chuckie Cheese w/o the games."}
{"text":"Great service, relaxing atmosphere, and delicious pizza. The thin crust was tasty.  Our server, Tushumbe, was awesome.  Great personality and attentive.  Drinks were perfect. We dined Sunday night, which was a good choice, not crowded."}
{"text":"We came to Scottsdale for our family vacation and found this place bc of Yelp and oh my gosh. We ate it twice in the 5 days we were there! So delicious. The first night we ordered and picked up and they had an amazing curbside pickup that was very efficient. Loved that. The second trip we ate inside the restaurant and they accommodated our 16 person party no problem. They gave the two little ones pizza dough to play with which they Loooved.   And the pizza? The pizza was amazing. That's really all there is to say."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a time or two and have been other Grimaldis in town.  The pizza is ok in my opinion. Nothing to write home about but some native New Yorkers in our family swear by it, so to each their own.  The issue here is service. The first time it was ok. Had to ask twice for a few things, but on a busy weekend night, that's totally understandable.  The last visit was on a quiet Monday night around 6:30pm. Not many of the tables were full so it wasn't drastically busy.  Nothing was right. There were three of us. We each ordered our own pizzas. First this drinks came out wrong and never got refilled.   Ask for water with lemon, no lemon served. Asked for pizza with olives, no olives on the pizza. Three pizzas for three people came out separately over the course of 15 mins. So we couldn't eat together without the others waiting and food getting cold. We were told the wrong pizza when it was brought to the table, so one person accidentally ate the other persons pizza while we were waiting and didn't discover the issue until 15 mins later when we had to ask about when the last pizza was coming. Only then we were informed it was dropped and cooking again. I get it, accidents happen... but let us know so we don't wait and let the other food get cold.  No apologies, just a server that said \"my bad\" when asking for the missing items. No manager to check on the service.   We decided that Boca park will be our go to for grimaldis.  On a positive note, I'm very pleased that they now have a gluten friendly pizza! It's so wonderful to see the menu growing. I'm sure as they continue to offer gluten free items, it will only get better like many places do. The crust is a bit dry but about average for most gluten free pizzas."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since moving back to Az and was pleased both times with the service and quality of the thin crust pizza. Always make sure to ask for extra sauce!   Everyone is friendly, the service is fast and restaurant is clean. It's a step above your every day pizza -- the high quality ingredients make it something special.  This location has a large parking lot in the rear of the building."}
{"text":"If the pizzeria passes the young munchers taste test, it is good pizza. I have not seen a young kid pack away so much pizza before in my life! Why leave any as leftovers? That is the sign of good pizza.  The atmosphere is fairly nice. Gotta love the bottle lights overhead. Though I do find we eat on the patio most often. Hey, why not be close to the fountain? Especially if you're going to run around it a few times during your meal. Stay for the pizza, tho!  I give a thumbs up to the employees. The exception being the busboy who reeked of what smelled like Hai Karate! But the front girls and the waitresses were very nice smelling. And better yet, competent and friendly. Yay team!  My one beef is that you're paying for this scenery in cost. Not really a value play. Though the pizza is good, it is more a place to go with scenery than it is a pizza lover's pizza."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good neighborhood chain pizza Grimaldi's is the top of the chain pizza's as far as taste.  The DON (Meat Pizza) is a traditional pizza topped with Italian Sausage, Meatballs and Pepperoni.  This is very flavorful and a meathead's dream!  My favorite pizza at Grimaldi's is the BROOKLYN BRIDGE has oven roasted red peppers, creamy ricotta cheese and hand pinched Italian sausage, atop their traditional pizza.  By far there best pizza there.  With the Brooklyn Bridge you get the creamy ricotta cheese right off the bat with the Italian sausage then POW the oven roasted red peppers gets you on the back end.  The reason for the 3 stars is that it is very expensive for a chain pizza.  Also, the waits at this location are very long even if you order take out which I do know to avoid long waits.  When I order take out which is probably your best bet you still would have to wait over an hour to sometimes 2 hours for your pizza to be done.  The service overall is ok, the waiters are not as attentive as you would like them to be but they get the job done at the bare minimum.  Overall, amazing tasting chain pizza but it will come at a cost, and some frustration.    BrandonFitFoodie"}
{"text":"Would have loved to have given this place 5 stars but the service wasn't great AT ALL. We had to reorder twice (maybe three times) and the glass of water they gave my friend was awful. Horrible taste. The other waters were fine...go figure. But the pizza was really, really good. Try the cream sauce with cheese. Lots of flavor and lots of garlic!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you how great this place is. We had Dallas as our bartender and he gave us the service and attention other restaurants should pay attention to. The salads are great. The pizza is amazing. And if you have room for a piece of cheesecake, tiramisu, or my favorite, a  cannoli, get the trio and settle for all of it. I'm a big fan of Grimaldi's and especially the old town location. Brian runs a perfect ship for us that crave a Grimaldi's fix in our lives. I see people getting take out all the time, so I'm not alone. Sit at the bar and let Dallas take care of you. He's amazing at his job and will guide you through the Wonderful beers, wines, salads, pizzas, deserts, Grimaldi's has to offer."}
{"text":"I love every Grimaldi's I've ever been to. This place has a trendy vibe. Probably due to the area. Very upscale. Food amazing. Go here."}
{"text":"If I could eat pizza everyday I would.  But this pizza is AMAZING!!! Yes you might have to pay for extra toppings but you \"get what you pay for\"!!! I would drive to Arizona just to eat this pizza it is soooooo gggoooodd!!!!  One of the best pizza places I have been too.  OH and the SANGRIA!!! AMAZING, and so fresh!!!  Love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Love going here. we normally do take out and on the weekends. we get the pizza and anti pasta. I think they are one of the top places for pizza in vegas"}
{"text":"I know it may seem strange to travel all the way to Las Vegas and then get a pizza, considering all the other food options available. But this is only if you have never had a pizza from Grimaldi's before.   Their plain Margharita pizza is a thing of simple beauty. A crisp, slightly charred crust, with a delicious tomato sauce, thin slices of fresh mozzarella cheese and a few sprigs of basil. So simple, so delicious!!!  The pizza may be a bit pricier than regular pizza joints, but you definitely get what you pay for and this is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Such mixed reviews for this place. The other locations have 4 stars and this one has a three. I\"m going to give this place 4 stars and try the other locations... THEY'RE PROBABLY 5s for me!! Yeee--!  Came here on a Friday late night and it wasn't crowded at all. Bartender was nice... gave us some nice suggestions and seemed to love his place of employment. Loved the decor. It paid homage to New York in a romantic, classy and  \"lower the lights, it's getting dim\" way.   A small Caesar salad goes a long way!!! Just a simple salad, nothing extrodinary.  THE PIZZA WAS DELISH. It's not a pizza joint where they have different types of pizza to choose from. Rather there's three types of sauces 1) Cheese and garlic 2) Tomato sauce 3) Pesto You can go halfies on these sauces on your pizza.  Then you choose the toppings. The price for this ranged from 2-4 dollars.  My pizza: Half cheese/garlic and pesto with RICOTTA cheese, sausage and mushrooms. Now the ricotta was a a nice touch but I think they could have had a lighter hand loading it on. It was a bit too much.... but the pizza was still delicious. The edges were nice and crispy but the middle wasn't so much, I think it was because of the ricctta. I could still taste the garlic after we left.   OoOooo I heard the cheese cake was good but I didn't have a chance to try it! :o/"}
{"text":"Great decor--nice pizzeria atmoshere with red and white checkered tablecloths. The unique lighting is made with wine bottles. The pizzas are New York style so the crust is thin and crispy. We ordered a small(16\") with sausage, bacon, mushrooms, and black olives. They inadvertantly added onions as well and were so apologetic that they offered to bake the pizza we'd ordered while we ate the one they'd brought to the table. We were okay with the onions so we told them not to bother baking another one. Our waitress apologized to us about the onions several times as we ate and was very attentive to our needs. The pizza was very tasty, but I have to admit that I would prefer a slightly thicker crust. You couldn't really pick up the slices--they drooped down so far that the toppings fell off. So we had to use a knife anf fork. But all in all, we enjoyed the pizza and were impressed with the service."}
{"text":"I am updating my review and giving Grimaldi's  2 extra stars for customer service! Shortly after I posted my review I received an email from the Restaurant Manager and he apologized for the service and offered for me to come in and meet with him to discuss my review.  I have been too busy to take him up on his offer but we have exchanged emails. I now look forward to trying Grimaldi's again, maybe with my family (which is still a good size group of 6) and see what changes they may have made and what they can offer!"}
{"text":"Big open space which is nice. Right when you walk in it smells amazing Had a good Caesar salad. Ordered a pizza of course. Came fast with good service but no ranch for the pizza bummer. Still great food I would come back."}
{"text":"Busy place but worth the wait. NY style pizza in Phoenix. Will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"The best pizza in the Valley, IMO. Fast service, and friendly wait staff to boot. Parking in and around the place sucks, but that's the norm in the Quarters. Long wait times are the only reason I don't give this place 5 stars. We've literally watched as tables were cleared, just to wait another 15 minutes for them to seat us in those very spots. They need to work on their coordination. Other than that, we love the place and have returned many times."}
{"text":"this place claims to be authentic NYC pizza in scottsdale.  while the service, the drinks and the salad are great, the pizza itself is anything but NYC style.  it's got the potential to be a good pizza place but doesn't fully live up to it.  the place has a nice homely feel to it so it's great to go chill at.  the pizza is in theory nice.  all the ingredients are fresh and the dough is nice but something didn't gel together.  oh well.  the house salad that preceded it was actually really good as it was big and their house vinagrette was tasty.    i also tried out too local beers.  the first was the mandarin madness hefeweizen and the kilt lifter.  the hefe was awesome and i now must go on another beer quest.  it was citrus and smooth and had lil beer after taste.  the kilt lifter totally was the wrong beer to follow it but held its own."}
{"text":"First time here....  nice thin crust....really good quality toppings and cheese.   Good tunes playing too...."}
{"text":"Super friendly service.  DELISH brick oven pizza.  cooked to perfection!!! =)"}
{"text":"NOM NOM!! I'd opt for the original marinara sauce vs the pesto.  Watch the jalopenos, they're spicy!"}

{"text":"Oh how I love my thin crust pizza. Place is good and kid friendly as it's pretty big! Get the house salad along with your pizza. Nom, nom!   Pizza had just the right amount of sauce on it. Btw - jalapeños are really spicy here!!!"}
{"text":"They never disappoint when it comes to pizza. I can usually say the same about the salad although this time it was sub par. But since usually the salad is as good as the pizza I will give it another shot next time I go."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing thin-crust pizza!!! If you're getting your own pizza, all you need is a personal pizza, it was more than enough. I ordered the white pizza with sausage and mushrooms, and it was delicious! My only complaint was it was a little dry, but other than that I was super happy with it. I won a little bit of money, so I treated 3 other girls, and it ended up being a little pricey but honestly, with the service, decor, and quality of food I\"m not complaining at all."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, it's hard not to come to the area and think of the Wives' of Orange County, or 90210. However Grimaldi's does serve some delicious food. We got a pepperoni and sausage pizza, and added ricotta cheese, and hot diggity dang was that a good pizza. If you are looking for a romantic quite spot then I would not recommend Grimaldi's you are sitting pretty open and it tends to get a bit noisy, especially on the weekends. They do offer take-out and have a small bar to enjoy a few barley pops-- and grape juice."}
{"text":"We love Grimaldi's pizza; however, this location is terrible at getting pizzas out in a timely fashion. We tend to drive over to the quarter instead because this one (while super close to our house) typically takes 45 min to get you your pizza and that's arriving at 5:00 when it's not busy! They also prioritize take out orders above the dine in customers so if it's a heavy takeout order night then you're also going to wait an exceptionally long time to get your pizza. This just doesn't work with little ones."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here with my cousin (who is a native to the land of Vegas).  He recommended this spot as a great place to share a pie.  We split a small half cheese half pepperoni which ended up being more than enough for the both of us.  The location in the Fashion Show mall seemed like it was busy quite often, but they handled the rush perfectly.  The service was impeccable and the food was, in a word, delectable.  I look forward to returning to this pizza destination when I return to Sin City."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza in Vegas so far. The ambiance of the place is cool too. Parking is always packed, but that's just Boca Park for you. Tastes awesome. They are really quick if you tell them you don't have much time. First time we were there we had to get to a show after and they were super quick! For some reason every time we are there someone breaks a glass. Inconsequential, just thought it was weird! Highly recommend the pepperoni and the pesto pizza with chicken, sundried tomatoes and olives! :)"}
{"text":"Always great service and food love this place always come here when we visit vegas and never disappointed"}
{"text":"We had pizza there last night and it was delicious.  The service was good and it was so nice sitting on the patio.  I love their thin crust pizza with my favorite toppings.  I'm not a fan of their deserts, but after the pizza, I'm too full for dessert anyway."}
{"text":"My husband go to Grimaldi's Pizzaria on Rampart all the time.  We were there last night and it was delicious.  He has been on a strict diet for a competition for a couple of months and after he won his trophy last night, Grimaldi's was our first stop.  He had 3 slices and I had 5.  Great pizza, nice atmosphere, service is average, but the hostesses are very cute.  We eat pizza all over the country and this place is at the top of the list."}
{"text":"Muy buena pizza. No me convencía del todo la pizza de Estados Unidos (tal vez tuve mala suerte), pero este local realmente ha ayudado a cambiar mi opinión, con un producto más cercano al local con su propio toque.  Las pizzas que ofrecen son enormes. La individual es para dos personas, la grande, para seis. La modalidad, bastante normal en el país, es de pagar la pizza, y luego adicional por cada 'topping'. Pedimos dos, una bastante tradicional (jamon, muzzarella, cebolla), y otra un poco más mescolanza (pollo, pepperoni, jamon, muzzarella). Para mi sorpresa, la mescolanza fue una cosa magnífica.  La atención buena, en un momento una moza rompió un vaso al lado de nuestra mesa y en segundos estaba el encargado disculpándose y asegurandose que estaba todo bien. El lugar está ubicado en el segundo piso del Palazzo, con un local bastante amplio. Precios dentro del estándar de la zona."}
{"text":"I'm from New York.  I know pizza.  This is good stuff.  The crust is thin.  It doesn't taste like New York crust, but it's pretty darn good.  Their cheese tastes fresh and good, and the pepperoni gets that awesome burnt edge that tastes so good.  This is much better pizza than you can get most places outside of NYC.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my go to restaurants for pizza pies.  Quality ingredients, cheese is not greasy like other pizza restaurants.   The taste of the crust is so delicious with a very slight burnt taste from the coal brick oven.  For the most part, the staff is friendly and provides a great experience.   I like mine with the red sauce, extra cheese, pepperoni, pesto and meatballs.  I usually order to go (which is quick)  so I can add tapatio!   Yessir!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing.  Some of the best pizza in town.  I love the flavor and texture that their coal brick oven brings.  Salads are fresh and well presented and the portions are more than generous.  What really made my visit and experience stand out was the bartender who helped me.  Natalie was amazing.  I haven't worked in a restaurant in over a decade but I still have an eye for talent.  Beautiful, efficient, knowledgeable and a sparkling personality she made my dining experience memorable.  She was swamped the entire time I was there yet everyone's drink stayed filled the waiters never had to wait and her smile and personality never missed a beat.  This ability to do her role and still give a wonderful, personal experience to everyone present is rare and under appreciated.  I'll be back without a doubt but I may have to steal this talented lady away from Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Great, very tasty wood-fired oven pizza in a chain environment (4 locations, 3 in Phx 1 in Vegas). Though I'm not a big fan of chains, I would still come here any time I was in the area with friends and we were craving pizza.   After we finished lunch, while boxing my left-over pizza in the kitchen the waiter dropped it on the floor. I had no way of knowing this but he came to our table to tell me, and offered to make me an entire new one I could take home. I didn't have time so I declined, but I appreciated the honesty. Thumbs up for that."}
{"text":"Looking in the Palazzo for some reasonable eats isn't easy. Grimaldi's serves fantastic pizza, nice salads and cold mugs of beer for the price of a few drinks elsewhere in the Palazzo/Venetian complex.   Our servers were superb, food top flight. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"If you don't come here you haven't lived oh man we got a pizza and a calzone I was in heaven it was the greatest"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of thin crust pizza but for this place I would recommend this place for is fresh toppings like the mozzarella and traditional sauces.  We came here for a birthday celebration because my SO signed up for their email list and you get a free large one topping pizza for your birthday.  There was some miscommunication with our server and received the pizza with a different sauce which we were fine with but the server and the manger were insistent on getting it taken care of.  The atmosphere is nice with it being nicer with the outdoor seating. The only complaint we really had was it was cold inside with the indoor seating"}
{"text":"Eating pizza in NY ruins you!  It just ruins you!  My first experience eating NY pizza was at the OG Grimaldi's and I haven't been the same since.  Sure, I found acceptable substitutes.  The wood fire farm to table fresh ingredients at my northern California spots but it is not the same.   I miss the simplicity of the slices I get when I visit NY.        What a pleasant surprise as I was walking though Sky Harbor airport to see an advertisement for Grimaldi's in AZ!  The first time we went with a large half white and half pepperoni.  The pizza was great!  Flavor, thickness, and quality was there.  Second time was a bit of a miss.  We had the personal white and personal margarita.  Both had great flavor but were so thin that they became a bit cracker like as they cooled off.  Still yummy but the texture was off.  Grimaldi's, I am keeping my options open...we can't be exclusive."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my family from out of town - we all live in different states - service was so excellent- we will find these chains back home- Kevin the manager really too care of us as well as the exceptional service from our bubbly server Alexis - we had an outstanding large perfectly cooked cheese pizza with basil- that's our go to pizza so we try them everywhere - one of the best! As well we topped it off with a dessert trio- the Cannolis were to die for - as well as the rich ny chzcake! WE WILL BE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! The service at this place was borderline terrible! For me, the entire dining experience plays a part in my review ratings and after waiting 10 minutes for the sever to take our drink orders and another 5 minutes for our drinks to arrive I was getting rather irritated.  The place was not even busy, maybe 1/4 of the tables were occupied if that. So there really isn't an excuse as to why the service was so poor!   The saving grace? The pizza was delicious! Before going to grimaldis I read reviews as to how bland the pizza was but do not believe it!  The pizza dough is crisp and the cheese was yummy! The sauce was just right!    Would I come back? Probably, but if I had the same server, I would probably walk right back out."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and service.  My first time there and I'll be back for sure.  I went in with my girl and sat at the bar.  The bartender/server was quick!  Got us our drinks and gave us a fast presentation about the place and how the pizza is made.    We ordered our pizza half white (ricotta) and half with tomato sauce but the order came out all tomato sauce.  He noticed the mistake and quickly placed an order for a new pizza with the white sauce and apologized and gave us the first pizza so that we could start eating.  Before we finished our first slices the second pizza arrived.  Fast fix and great timing.    Thanks to the mistake we got a free pizza.  The food was Fantastic and the service was great.  I would probably only given them 4 stars because of the mistake but because of the way they handled it, 5 stars all day!  I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This is one of my boyfriend's favorite pizza places. The service is extremely friendly and I was surprised when the hostess went out of her way to open the door when we entered and left the restaurant. Our waiter was also kind and attentive and rushed to put our order in as soon as we sat down.    We ordered a large pepperoni with extra mozzarella cheese. Their pizza is NY style, so it's a thin delicious crust. All of the ingredients tasted so fresh, especially the marinara sauce. I definitely recommend Grimaldi's if you're craving some fresh thin-crusted pizza!"}
{"text":"First of all, I love thin crust pizza from a coal fired oven.  Grimaldi's on Scottsdale Road is tasty, crisp and reminds me of the great pizza from Philly.  The '2' is because of the dumb schedule and poor service.   We stopped recently for lunch and had an excellent pie.  But the service was really crappy, it took 15 minutes for someone to wander by and collect our order.  Then we wait another 15 for drinks, and finally the pizza showed up.  No one refreshed the drinks or came by to check on us.  AND, there was only one other party in the place!  The other item is availability.  They re-stoke the fire in the oven at 4:00 PM.  So you can't get a pizza until 5:30.  Now if you want to stop on the way home to get a pizza for Friday night dinner, forget it.   Dumb."}
{"text":"This place was a let down . I've heard a lot of good things about grimaldis. When I walked in it was good , they opened the door for me and the host had a pleasant attitude . The ambiance was very nice with natural daylight lighting up the interior. Decorations were beautiful making it feel as if you were in New York.   However, when it came to our server he seemed like he was not happy to be there and not happy that we were there . He repeated the specials as if he was reading out of a book and was bored . He also did not refill half of the tables drinks only when we asked .  As for the food we ordered two large pizzas, one was very good and moist but the other one fell a little dry . So it was inconsistent . The Caesar salad was so yummy though ! And an excellent complimentary to the pizzas .   They also give kids balls of pizza dough to roll around which was cute :)   My experience was okay taking into account the okay service to the dry and moist pizzas and the yummy Caesar salad . So I would say it was an okay experience . Maybe I'll come back to give it another shot , maybe they had an off day ?"}
{"text":"Ordered a small calzone to share.  It was plenty big enough to share but they are $16 for plain cheese and $2 for each additional topping.  That is just crazy to me.  The pepperoni is like the kind in the chef boyardee pizza kits, just not what I was expecting.  Overall,  it was okay. The service was good, the wait was really long, the food was meh. Maybe try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"So we meet again. Me and Grimaldi's. I have to say I have seen the light. In the form of a white pizza.....  I forgot I was a part of their Birthday Club and low and behold I get the email wishing me Happy Birthday in the form of a free pizza. It didn't end up being completely free, but I don't care. What I do care about is I tasted the glory in their white sauce pizza with sausage. It was garlicky, it was crispy and slightly chewy and just the right amount of every ingredient. I would have liked a little more fresh Basil, but that is the story of my life. The sausage was savory and spicy without overpowering the other ingredients.This pizza was just what I needed and I have even almost gone back. I know, it's insane.  Downfalls. Because you know I gots sum;)  1. Loud, loud, loud. I'm not sure if it's because of the flooring or brick walls, but I could not think it was so terribly loud and it gave me extreme anxiety. My hearing is better than most so imagine being able to hear twenty conversations at once. Yeah, bad news bears. Next time I return I will be wearing headphones.  2. Bright lights. Pet peeve is bright lights in a restaurant in the evening. I don't need to see or hear the fifty kids fondling their raw dough, wasting the parm on the table and pretending to make their own za. I also don't need to see my date's pores. Ever.  3. 4pm. Whatever you do 4pm is not the time to come to Grimaldi's. They do something to the oven at that time for about 20-30 minutes and you cannot get a pizza. Instead you have to eat a boring salad with a bitter dressing and stare at each other. You can't talk because you can't hear each other over the noise. I really think the chef might just be celebrating 4:20p everyday getting erie mon. Whatever he did my pie tasted like a million bucks so keep on keepin on Chef pizza dude.   Will I return? Oh hellz yeah. Just for the Large White Sauce with Garlic and Sausage and extra Basil pie. Kudos Grimaldi's for redeeming yourself. I am feelin' you big time. Until we meet again my new white saucy friend."}
{"text":"The good: pizza dough was delicious. Sauce was tasty, but I wish there was more. Toppings were equally tasty. atmosphere was lively. Clean restaurant and friendly staff.   The bad: It's a bit pricey and for my money I'd rather go to Dom demarco or due forni.   Overall: it's good. You'll get your NY pizza fix. But it isn't over the top spectacular. If someone asked me to go I would, but it's not a place I'd openly suggest going to."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza joints in AZ. First let me start off by saying their classic pizza is tasty, not a fan of red sauce usually, but theirs is delicious. It's fresh tasting, and has just the right amount of spice, and it's not sugary sweet. But the winner here is the White Pizza, it is off the hook!! This is just a yummy combination of Olive Oil, Seasonings, beautiful Fresh Mozzarella Cheese, and lots of wonderful roasted garlic, it is amazing!!! The Caprese  Salad is also a  winner, beautiful fresh tomatoes, fresh Mozzarella, Basil, and a very nice balsamic reduction, so tasty and fresh!! This is a must stop for me when I'm in Old Town Scottsdale, especially since the landlord forced the closure of the one in Tucson!"}
{"text":"Pizza is YUM!!! But what makes this place 5 star is Devon the bartender. He is attentive, friendly and really just overall amazing at his job!!! I highly recommend coming here if you want great pizza and amazing customer service."}
{"text":"Excellent food, we go here a few times a month. This location is better than the other ones. Bartenders are awesome too, we typically just sit at the bar and eat. Great place to take out of town guests to"}
{"text":"This review is only for take-out, as I've enjoyed their take-out 10+ times, but have never eaten in the restaurant.  If I could give them 3.5 stars, I would, without question, but I just can't quite go to 4 stars.    The pizza is always good and made when you order.  The made to order part is outstanding, but, it always seems to take way longer than it should to prepare a pizza. The service, while friendly, has also always been a bit too casual and not entirely focused on the service part.  Now, we have only ever ordered from them late in the evening (Go figure, late night pizza in Vegas! Shocking!), so they're probably thinking about closing duties, but still.  The bar area where you order and wait maybe seats 7 people' it shouldn't be that hard to get some more water or order another beer.  The other thing that really prevents me from going up another star is the pricing.  It just seems absurd to pay anywhere from $2-$4 for toppings, on top of a small pizza already being $14.  Some of the pricing also just seems weird; sausage is $2 but jalapenos are $4? A jalapeno that is, at most, $1.00 in the store (if it's organic!)?   Jim G. and I aren't even supposed to be eating these carbs, so this shouldn't even be an issue.  I hope, for my own sake, that I don't get sucked in to eating this too many more times.  However, when I do, at least I know that the pizza will be fresh and it will be good.  But I also know that it will take too long and cost more than it should."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, especially if your used to east coast pizza.  The crust is amazing, toppings are good, service is nice"}
{"text":"If you want to-the-tee authentic Brooklyn pizza, go to Brooklyn. But, if you want a nice alternative of Brooklyn pizza meets the hot desert, visit Grimaldis.   Whenever I walk into Grimaldis and see the red and white checkered tablecloths, the pizzas being made in front of your eyes, the bottles of wine going around and the red brick brightening up the place, it takes me back to my childhood days of classic pizza parlors, Friday night pizza and TGIF TV. The pizza here is large, doughy and pretty tasty. I normally go for the classic pepperoni and I like the pepperonis they choose. The pizzas don't run cheap but it could easily feed a family of four. The pizzeria has plenty of seating and at nighttime, the place will be hustling and bustling with everyone from the retired, to the date night couples to families out for a cheesy treat.   So this is a pizza parlor. Is it the best pizza in Phoenix? That's for you to decide. I think it's good, but pizza is pizza. If I could do 3.5 stars, I probably would, but it gets four because it's in a good location, the pizza leaves me happily satisfied and it provides a fun atmosphere if you want to feed your grease addiction and take it back to the Lady and the Tramp days (you know, when they eat the spaghetti and then kiss?) of amore in the Italiano pizza parlor environment."}
{"text":"This is one of those spots I would probably deem a 3.5 if there were half star options, but since there aren't, I decided that it was worth rounding up.   I got the chance to check out the newest Grimaldi's while on the way to a graduation party. We wanted a casual atmosphere in North Scottsdale and decided Grimaldi's was it!   It was around 6 PM on a Saturday and we got a seat on the patio right away without a wait. The decor of Grimaldi's has the same vibe as the others but with a North Scottsdale feel to it. They have split patios that hold about six-ten tables each. Red checkered table clothes line the tables and apparently they are even on hand for for customer's who get chilly. Seriously, I saw a customer eating at a table while wrapped in one of the red checkered table clothes. I really liked the private room they have with about six tables and big enough for a group of probably 15-20. For those who want to drink their dinner, they also have a bar in the front with bar seats.   Moving on to the food, this is the same Grimaldi's food as other places. We started with the Cesar Salad which tasted like your typical Cesar Salad. For the entree, we went for a sausage, mushroom and pepperoni pizza. Now the only problem I have with the pizza is that sometimes it doesn't have enough cheese or sauce, so to fix that we asked for extra cheese and sauce and that absolutely helped! I really like the pizza but only when I eat it at the restaurant. Every time I get the pizza to go it gets cold and loses the taste.   This is a great addition to the Scottsdale Quarter and I think it adds a family atmosphere option to the area. Parking here is such a hassle though that I will probably stick to the Old Town location for the most part, but when I'm in the area, I will definitely keep this as an option."}
{"text":"Best pizza i've ever had in my life!! Very pleasant staff and lovely atmosphere with Ol' Blues Eyes playing in the background.   I love that they offer special pizzas throughout the year and fresh basil on top of any pizza.  They also offer a pesto base.  How can you beat that!?  Desert, wine, beer...It's all here amd complimentary to any meal, as well as their delicious fresh salads as an appetizer. My pickiest of friends have come to try and now love Grimaldi's.  Did I mention the free large pizza you may have for your birthday?"}
{"text":"When we walked it we were shocked by how nice this pizzeria was. The lights were dimmed, wine glasses as lighting just looked really nice inside.  We had a party of 11 they had a table ready for us within 2 minutes! We ordered the Don substituted sausage for spicy chicken sausage. It was delicious. Very thin large slices. The kids had pepperoni they also enjoyed thier pizza. Then we ended with Cheesecake for dessert. The kids had a peppermint Cheesecake  (didn't come with candy cane because they were out), we ordered the toffee Cheesecake mmmm so good. Enjoyed our dinner very much."}
{"text":"Our family's favorite pizza place -our weekly go to restaurant.      Limited menu but great pizza and salad."}
{"text":"Just had a terrible experience ...waited 45 minutes for our pizza only to be told they don't have the proper ingredients for our buffalo chicken pizza and that they needed to stoke the ovens before cooking the pizza. Complete waste of our time. Will never be back."}
{"text":"Incredibly overpriced pizza that is slightly above average. The pesto pizza vaguely tasted like pesto (try the pesto pizza from Whole Foods, or go to Pizza My Heart in California for the best) and the sausage/pepperoni sacrificed overall taste for fanciness. If I paid 1/3 the price, that would barely warrant what I received tonight. Interestingly enough, their box says \"The Pizza that made the Brooklyn Bridge Famous\", yet the 11 states listed do not include New York. Maybe people kept jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge after wasting their money. If you want to be pretentious and impress some clueless diner, by all means eat there."}
{"text":"My kids didn't want to leave the pool at Palazzo. So I ordered pizza to take out. The bartender took my order for $33.56. I handed him $35, and was expecting $1.44 in change. As he was facing the register he asked if I wanted \"any change back\"? Didn't know that I was held to pay any gratuity for a one pie take out order! I was placed in an embarrassing situation and told him \"no it was fine\" what else could I have said. Servers name is on the receipt I posted."}
{"text":"Wow is all I have to say! Service staff was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was perfect! And the food?! Forget about it! It's perfect from the antipasto to their pepperoni pizza this place gets an A+ in my book"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have eaten in years. The Cesar salad dressing in very good. Ordered 2 pizza s a red sauce and white sauce both very good"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in here on a Friday night at about 7:15 and we grabbed the last two seats at the bar. So glad we did because right after we sat down there was a 20 minute wait. We decided to order a large pepperoni pizza and share that. The pizza came about 20 or so minutes later and it was so good! I forget how good the pizza is here and so glad we decided to pop in for dinner. We ate all but two slices (yeah for leftovers the next day). I am already looking forward to our next visit!!! Great food and great services. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza. Defenitely one of my favorite pizza restaurants. Service is most always very very good. They do get busy on a friday or saturday night but usually dies down around 830-9pm. The ceaser salad is done in a fresh made ceaser dressing the house salad is very good along with the caprese salad or antipasto. We normally get sausage or ham. Im not from new york or chicago who claim they have the best pizza but compared to amore of chicago and the newyork pizzas they have around here grimaldis is far better. I believe they have new york roots either way great pizza spot good for family and friends. Desert is very sweet and normally just stay away from it."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza in the area.  It's coal fired NY style pizza.  Both the white garlic and regular sauce are yummy and the pepperoni are the little thick cut ones.  The menu is not big: pizza, calzones, and a few salads.  If you go at dinner try and get a reservation there is ALWAYS a long wait.  Sign up for their birthday club, you get a free large pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late lunch/early dinner during a work trip. I have been to the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and this is just the same. Without the insane wait. I had the caprese salad, Brooklyn Bridge pizza, and a glass of the Lupino Pinot Grigio. The pizza was hands down amazing! Totally legit Italian-I lived in Florence for a while. I added a bit of crushed pepper, but great taste-crispy bottom and warm gooey top. The wine was good-plus came during happy hour so it was $2 off. The caprese was alright, but I wouldn't recommend because it had regular old tomatoes and real caprese should be made with Roma since there's a lot less seeds. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Large, New York style pizzas are the speciality here....be still my heart. The pizzas are a bigger size than you may be used to, and they come with tons of toppings. My table ordered The Don, and it was pretty tasty and packed full of toppings, which is just how I like it. The pizza crust was where things fell off for me a bit, though. The outter crust was burnt and somehow, the crust under the pizza was slight burnt but was still mushy enough you couldn't pick up your slice to eat it, and had to cut it me eat it with a fork instead. The wait staff was fun and kind but pretty disorganized. This is a cute pizza place and I would give it another try sometime in the future if someone suggests it, but for my money, there are better options to look into on The Strip."}
{"text":"Great brick oven pizza, always get the pepperoni and the pesto is a must try. Friendly staff, not a long wait and it always tastes great. Definitely my favorite pizza place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I feel this place is overcharge for a pizza. There wasn't much topping and wasn't flavorful. Each bite wasn't filling. Just made me hungry and nothing astonishing about the pizza. I just keep eatting the pizza to fill my hunger and not really enjoying it. I've had better thin crusted pizza that made me wanted to eat more and come back. This isn't a place to go if you're starving."}
{"text":"Fabulous dining experience even in spite of a stumble. My husband and I ordered The Don.  Unfortunately there was a mishap while the pizza was being served, and my husband ended up wearing a slice of pizza. The staff took care of us in a kind and professional way both before and after the flying slice of pizza. Our pizza was delicious, and our service was friendly and efficient. The crust had the perfect amount of char from the coal oven, and the toppings were plentiful and flavorful. I'm not usually a fan of meatballs, but the meatballs on this pizza were exceptionally good, and generous in size.  We also ordered the caramel coconut cheesecake for dessert, which was delicious. Creamy, fresh,and very flavorful.  I would definitely return to this restaurant, and will likely seek out their Arizona counterpart when I return home."}
{"text":"Always a great pie from Grimaldi's! Whether it's from this location or the one in Gilbert, AZ."}
{"text":"I cant get over how much I love the food here. The pizza is as good as I've had in NYC. Perfect thin crust, sauce and toppings. The Calzone has the lightest, creamiest filling ever. The caesar salad is delish and the sangria goes great with it all. Service is great and super friendly. My only warning is if you dont like kids in restaurants, go as late as possible since the place is very popular with families."}
{"text":"Staying in Palazzo, I decided to give Grimaldi's Pizzeria a try. FYI for those staying in the Palazzo or Venetian, you cannot charge the bill to your room.   Looking at all the positive reviews posted, I guess I ordered the wrong pizza. The bf and I ordered a pepperoni, bacon, and bellpepper pizza and a caesar salad. The crust/dough was probably the best part about the pizza. I usually love cheese, but this cheese was a bit thick and chewy. Anyone know what kind of cheese they use? And usually bacon makes everything better, but this bacon was not traditional breakfast bacon, but thicker pieces of meaty bacon. The caesar salad was a good size, but the dressing had a slightly bitter aftertaste and the croutons were just dried pieces of bread without any seasoning. Though the food was not the best, the server was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"It was refreshing to find a restaurant that wasn't a chain and did not have four $ dollar signs on Yelp. Nice manager and bartender, wine bottles with the bottoms cut out hanging from the ceiling w light bulbs in them at the bar. Delicious Caesar Salad w chicken.  White wine flight only $15 (a bargain for this town), red wine flight $30 consists of three 3oz glasses of wine. Includes Stag's Leap + Caymus hence the price for the red flight. The Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Grigio, and Vougnier were great."}
{"text":"The food quality from Grimaldi's is a know quality, it is good at all of their locations.  The problem I have is their online menu.  Yelp is forced to use this PDF from Grimaldi's website from October 2012 since it has prices on it:  https://www.grimaldispizzeria.com/assets/uploads/MainMenuOct2012.pdf  If you go to the same domain name and click on menu you get this page, (with NO prices):  https://www.grimaldispizzeria.com/menu_type/pizzas/  The 2012 page has an individual pizza for $9 and a meatball add on for $2.  The two times I have been to the Rainbow location in Vegas I had the same conversation.    me: Your online prices are much lower, $9 pizza and $2 meatball add on, this receipt says $16.  server: where online?  me: Yelp  server: oh see that is the problem using Yelp, meatballs were never $2.  me: The menu on Yelp links to a page on the Grimaldispizzeria.com website.  server: oh  Probably not a big deal for people eating on location, but anyone ordering for take out, beware of the bait-n-switch, whether intentional or not."}
{"text":"I liked this place but I didn't love it. The atmosphere was decent.   The service was just okay.   The plain pie was so-so. The sausage, pepperoni, onion and peppers was really good.   I am probably a pizza snob because I am from NY/NJ, so I am very partial to the pizza I am eating.   I don't know if I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Great pizza with good prices. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot with friends from work. They have some of the best thin crust Italian style pizzas I've ever had. Great deserts too. They are classy, but not super pricey.   The seating and good view out the windows was comfortable."}
{"text":"The pizza is consistently delicious here. We alway get a plain cheese pie. The pie is very thin crust with extremely flavorful sauce and mozzarella cheese. It is quite expensive at $16.00 (plus tax) for a plain large cheese  pie, there are now cheaper places to get delicious pizza in our area but Grimaldis pizza will not dissapoint."}
{"text":"Great pizza and salad. Service in the bar from Krysti was outstanding. She recommended Milli Gradi wine that was delicious and a great price."}
{"text":"i love grimaldi's but this location isn't that good.  i got a kale salad and a small margherita.  the pizza i've had at grimaldi's is usually super crispy, but this one was not.  i also don't like how they baked the pizza w/ the basil, so the basil was burnt.  shouldn't it be placed on the pizza after you take it out of the oven?"}
{"text":"love the pizza here!  i had 2 slices of the large and was full but kept wanting to eat b/c it was so good!"}
{"text":"after my mediocre meal at hakkasan, we had grimaldi's for lunch.  i was probably still starving from my lack of dinner, and i inhaled the pizza here.  the crust is so good and nice and thin.  i tried a tomato pie and a white pie w/ anchovy.  the white pie was amazing, and i kept wanting to eat more.  if the original brooklyn location is even better than this, then i have to go on my next trip."}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time and Grimaldi's did not disappoint.   We ordered 1/2 cheese 1/2 spicy chicken sausage pizza and a house salad. It's a little pricey but worth every penny.   We will be back."}
{"text":"There pizza here is awesome!  I find myself here for lunch once in a while with work friends.  About once every three months.  I would go more often, but the service... oh the service....  The service during lunch, brings this place down from a 5 star pizza place to a 3 star place.  Drink refills are always lacking, late and never there.  It almost seems like they're understaffed.  The pizza takes a looooong time to get out of the kitchen.  By then we're irritated and extremely hungry.    At that point, we just eat as quickly as possible and leave.     Your waitresses need to check in and give more refills.  The only time we see them is: 1 Taking our order, 2 checking in AFTER the pizza comes, and 3 to give us our check."}
{"text":"Get the personal pizza, not the medium/large. If you do some nerdy calculation, you get less for your money when you get anything larger than a single pizza.   Pizza was flavorful (but what pizza isn't?) and a personal pizza is enough to split between two girls. I didn't find this pizza to be super amazing or anything. I'd much rather go to the secret pizza place at the Cosmo.  This is a good place if you want something relatively quick, easy, and affordable."}
{"text":"The pizza we had at Grimaldi's was really good. We went there for a late dinner one night and enjoyed ourselves. There were some people who came in and sat right next to us- even though there were a lot of tables open- one guy even ran into my mom and didn't apologize. Other than that everything was good and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Pizzas, calzones and salads all very taste..the place is a typical Italian pizzeria, very cozy .."}
{"text":"The pizza here is DELICIOUS!  If New York style pizza is not your thing, this place probably isn't for you. But because of how good it is, you should probably try it anyway.  I am more a of Chicago style pizza girl myself.  But this place does NOT disappoint.   This place has a nice atmosphere. A good place for kids; they give them crayons and serve apple juice.  During our week long stay here in Arizona, we've found that a lot of restaurants here in Arizona don't have apple juice.  The service is great.  They servers are friendly and really attentive. Our server was Casey, super nice!!!  We ordered a pizza with red sauce, pepperoni and mushrooms.  Plain, I know.  But it was soooo good!  The mozzarella cheese was so fresh, and the sauce is perfect! The cheese and sauce definitely make the pizza.  For dessert, we ordered a Somoa Cheesecake, and a canoli.  Everything was just so good, we might have to come back before we go home to California!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! The white garlic sauce is amazing!!! Also tried the red sauce with pepperoni and sausage. It was also really good. You can do 1/2 sauces on the pizzas! Service was perfect! Drinks always filled and very friendly staff. We will defiantly be back! Must try the Oreo cheesecake!!!!"}
{"text":"I seriously did not know pizza could be so de-lish!  Another update - I have been here over a dozen times and the food and service is consistently outstanding!  I'm a true fan!"}
{"text":"I started with antipasta and the a delicious pizza. Had a glass of the white Sangria which was nice n refreshing.  our server was very friendly and the manager even touched the table. Great job"}
{"text":"the absloute best pizza in old town scottsdale. thin crispy crust and prices are extremely reasonable. funny though....one time we ate there, the door girl was falling asleep at her desk. good stuff."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza is Ny style. They nailed it! So good! I recommend the Don. And salad is amazing and so fresh!"}
{"text":"I met a family member at the Scottsdale Quarter for lunch this past week, and as we walked around from one restaurant to another, we saw one long wait after another.  We came across Grimaldi's and was very pleased to see no wait time to sit down.  I had been to a Grimaldi's but not in a while.  The customer service has consistently been stellar and the atmosphere can be a casual one or a fancier one depending on who you are with and if you are in the private dining room.  The manager even stopped by to say hello, and the wait time for the food to arrive was very short.    The food itself was also very tasty and reasonably priced.  We ordered an appetizer and a personal pizza, which was plenty to share.   All pizzas are thin crust and wood-fired...my favorite pizzas!  If we were up for it, there was also a nice dessert and drinks menu.    I'm still unsure as to why there were less people in Grimaldi's than other restaurants.  Don't get me wrong, they still had a constant stream of traffic.  Perhaps it is the location, where Grimaldi's is hidden at the Scottsdale Quarter.  I definitely recommend Grimaldi's as a great pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Since I gave the one at the Palazzo such a bad review, I just wanted to say for the record, that I love this location.  The staff is good and friendly.  The pizza isn't the best I've ever had, but you can definitely taste the freshness of the ingredients and you can tell that it is not loaded with preservatives and chemicals.  I normally get the roasted red peppers and garlic and that's good enough for me.  Don't let the \"personal\" size pizza fool you.  It's still big enough for two people.  And they have a decent beer and wine selection.  It's always a solid choice for me."}
{"text":"After waiting at the bar for ten minutes without even an acknowledgement from the bartender who was arguing with a waitress over her personal order, I walked out.  As I did, the hostess just smiled.  And it was only me and another person at the bar.  Will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"Very busy on Friday night but they do take reservations!  Excellent thin crust pizza !!  We had the Don and was enjoyed by all!"}
{"text":"Since my family and I eat here at least once a month i should leave a review. This place is amazing. beer selection is great. Best Pizza in Arizona. Never bad service and place is always busy. Great cheesecake!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is incredible with a large topping selections. They have installed a water filtering system to produce water that taste like it's from NYC. The coal fired pizza oven cooks the crust to a crisp finish."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Phoenix, where we have many great options. They have a number of locations in town but I tend to go to the DC Ranch location the most. The manager tells me they treat the water to mirror the taste of NYC water, home of the original location. The pizza is a thin crust, coal fired, taste of heaven. The sauce complements the pizza without being overpowering. Their Mediterranean salad is excellent and large enough to share.The wine and beer options are adequate. The bar is kinda small, maybe seats 10. However they have two rooms of tables, plus outside seating. Finally, this location gets busy on Fri and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Coal brick-oven pizzeria offering good tasting slices of pizza. Delicious salads paired with refreshing strawberry lemonade! The cooking process of how these pizzas are made definitely makes a difference. A bottom texture with a dusty taste of gentle crispy crust. Thin sometimes blacken in some portions on the bottoms of the pizza. Give a unique taste that will have you appreciating all the work that goes into coal brick-oven pizza. Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"The only reason why I'm giving this Place. Three stars is because. The hostess rubbed me the wrong way. I been to other Restaurants &  usually. The hostess Is Very welcoming !! I  felt like She Was Either having a bad Day or just hates or job.  Super unwelcoming but foods great !!!"}
{"text":"The Brooklyn (DUMBO) Grimaldi's may have starred in my finest pizza meal.  Upon finding out I could have a Take 2 in Scottsdale, I scoffed, then gave in.  It turns out it's close.  The ingredients and recipe seemed dead on, reminded me of BK.  However, the execution's a bit off.  I don't demand perfection, but I know it's in Brooklyn.  _C$"}
{"text":"Sadly this is one of our favorite family restaurants and we usually arrive early to beat the crowds but tonight customer service was lacking. As soon as we walk in to get a table, there's no friendly greeting or we will be with you in a minute. We're just left standing there waiting to be acknowledged even though there are two men behind the stand. When one of the men finally decides to show us to the table and gives us the menus, no one shows up to take our drink order or tell us that they're our server. We decided to leave after 15 minutes since there was plenty of wait staff. When we left, we told the man who seated us that no one came to our table and he really didn't seem to care too much that we were walking out."}
{"text":"Love the pizza at Grimaldi's!!  I really haven't had anything bad here and I've come both for business as well as with my family. Don't skip the dessert!!  Our favorite is the tiramisu and we try to order it whenever we come (if we have room for it). On average, we probably eat here every other month or we order a pie to take home but eating at the restaurant is probably the best because it's straight out of the oven!!!"}
{"text":"Itsa just likea New York or so they say. While the toppings here are pretty good, the crust just doesn't live up to NY style pizza and was a bit mushy. The overall experience is similar, trying too hard to be New York but missing out. The wine list is strong, but the beer menu is pretty lacking. Service was pretty grumpy and a bit slow. It's not the worst choice for pizza in Las Vegas, but there is better."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a very welcoming feel to it, and I liked how attentive the employees were.  In terms of the pizza, we ordered a medium with tomatoes and mushrooms.  I knew it was a bit on the plane side, but the pizza could have definitely used more seasoning, salt, flavor, something.  I think I've eaten at the New York one before, and I remember that pizza tasting much better."}
{"text":"Pizza as good as it gets. Real NY style. Never knew how much goes into making a pizza but found out when visited Grimaldi's during Tasting Tour of Old Scottsdale. Grimaldi's does pizza and does it terrific. Can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Prices seemed a little high but after I had the pizza, I understood the prices. The pizza was good and service was great. I would recommend this place for a nice date night."}
{"text":"My pizza was delivered 33 minutes late.  I ordered the Brooklyn bridge pizza and it arrived cold and it was really bland.  Given how expensive the pizza is, I was shocked how bland and poor quality it seemed to taste.  Very disappointed.  No flavor.  Expensive.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and Salads. Went here a few weeks ago for girls dinner and had a great time. Would highly suggest it. Also have visited the one in Old Town and great time and food there as well.   Tried to heat up the pizza the next day, since I had tons of leftovers and it was disgusting lol not sure what happened.. but good the day of :)"}
{"text":"I would give Grimaldi's 5 stars but I can't say its as good as NY pizza but it was pretty damn good! Friends of mine who lived in Vegas wanted to take me to Grimaldi's while I was in town last month. I have to say I was impressed!! We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night and it was busy, so busy I thought there would be at least a 20-30 minute wait but I was wrong we got a table right away. Our table was located right in front of the kitchen were the guys were making the pizza's. When I sat down and saw the brick-oven pizza's coming out of the oven I knew I was in for a treat!! They were thin crusted topped with fresh ingredients and a brickoven/coal bottom.   We started off with the cold antipasti platter. Italian meats, cheeses, olives and fresh foccacia bread. Your typical cold antipasti platter, you can't go wrong.   For dinner we ordered a Large pizza; half with pesto, pepperoni and onions and the other half; tomato sauce, sausage, mushrooms, artichokes and olives. They both were great! I would have to say the tomato, veggies and sausage side was my favorite however I really enjoyed the mini peperoni's that were on the other size, usually its large slices of pepperoni.   Grimaldi's also has a great wine selection. Since my friends are regulars the server was kind enough to offer me help on selecting a glass of white wine and even brought me out a few samples!   The restaurant is a fun, casual atmosphere with bar half inside and half outside with outside seating. Perfect for a warm but cool Vegas night! I would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Having eaten at easily 125-150 pizza places over the past  20 years Grimaldi's hands down was in the top 3.  And sharing the other two spots is Leftys in San Diego and Genos in Chicago.  Surprisingly it was the thin crust that blew my mind.  The dough was slightly above average but the sauce was like the visual magic of thousands of butterflies.  Imagine that joy put into a sauce.  The dough could have been pavement for all I was concerned - the sauce would have made it edible.  Place was jam packed and was still able to get in and out in under an hour."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. We got a pizza and had tiramisu for dessert. The pizza needed more cheese and the the crust was a bit too thin, in my opinion. Maybe I just prefer a little more bread under my toppings... Also, I don't like tiramisu but they had a good one.  One thing I did notice was that this place was first restaurant on this AZ trip where we were greeted us with a slight rudeness. The servers were good though."}
{"text":"When I lived in NYC, I tried the original Grimaldi's and never went back when I discovered 2 Bros dollar pizza tasted 100x better. And I'm sad to say it's the same for the Grimaldi's here.   The sauce is bland and the service is subpar. The only saving grace was the mozzarella they put on it.  I'll be back at the NY pizza place on rainbow when I need to satisfy my NY pizza cravings."}
{"text":"Pizza was so good..  - Good crust/texture - Taste/Flavor was amazing - Waitress was so nice!   Good is good is good. I don't really know how to describe pizza so I'll let my pictures do the talking this time. I want more ):"}
{"text":"The service was great, the only bad thing was we waited almost 1 hour for our pizza and it was under cooked. We also ordered a Cesar salad and we never received it. The place was pack and we never had a consistent waiter."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the East Valley.  Coal fired pizza cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"Excellent thin-crust pizza. Very friendly service. They provided pizza dough for our son to play with, it was so cute. Perfect place to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon having fresh, flavourful pizza with a chilled glass of proseco."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold and horrible and staff was rude.  We will not be going back and we'll suggest the same to our friends locally"}
{"text":"Delizioso! That perfectly describes the pizza here. What is it about this pizza that makes it so darn delicious? The cheese? The crust? The toppings? The fact that I'm starving? Do they really ship the water for the pizza all the way from NYC? No, but after having the pizza here, I'd believe it. According to their website, they actually hired \"...a chemist to analyze and recreate the mineral content and exact composition of the water.\"  I had a large pepperoni pizza with sausage on half of it and mushroom on the other half. It was everything you expect New York pizza to be. So so good! I loved the thin crispy, slightly burnt crust and the quality ingredients. The the mini pepperonis were just perfect with the sausage. I don't normally eat the crust but it was that good.  My absolute favorite pizza place. If only I lived in Vegas. Located on the 2nd floor of the Palazzo, there is rarely a wait. If you love good pizza, especially New York style pizza,  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to Grimaldi's a few times for pizza and was never really disappointed, yet never fully satisfied either.   This place is located on Eastern Avenue very conveniently close to 215 so it won't be hard to get there, and the restaurant does offer a few parking spaces that unfortunately tend to be occupied most of the time. The restaurant itself isn't so large, so you might have to wait to get seated depending on the time/day.  I had several different types of pizza there, and the pizzas were always fresh and decently but I would definitely have expected something better, particularly given the price of the pizza/toppings.  One good thing about this place is the atmosphere which is pretty nice, with the restaurant's decor participating quite greatly to it.  In conclusion, I would say that this place is average but you could still check it out if you're in the area and are craving pizza! Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"This Grimaldi's location never disappoints. We love it. The salads and appetizers are always up to par. Pizza is never soggy. Cold, refreshing drinks as well. Decor is super cute and New York-style. Have tried their cannoli a few times and it was great. Wish there was a location this consistently good in Southern California. Anyway, we'll be back each time we visit Vegas. Always satisfied here."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza in the valley. We've had several different pizzas here and each one has been amazing. There is something special about the crust - ask them about it when you go. Soon to be your favorite too!"}
{"text":"This is the place I go to when I need to bring pizza for game days.  It's on the expensive side, yes, but the mix of a thin, chewy crust and the right ratio of sauce to cheese and toppings keep me coming back here time and time again."}
{"text":"Yum, yum!   Had a free large pizza for my birthday so my girlfriend and I stopped by this location for dinner since it was conveniently across the street from our Treasure Island hotel in the Palazzo.  We were seated pretty quickly and our server Max, was pretty friendly.  We ordered just a standard pepperoni pizza with a side Caesar salad. I usually prefer a good amount of sauce on my pizza, but the pizza still had good sauce, flavor, and crunch.   Our salad was plenty and enough for 3 good servings between my girlfriend and I.  I'm definitely coming back to TI, so you bet we're coming back for more pizza here :)"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty terrible. We spent over $100 on 5 pizzas for take out and they were just in general low quality. Tasted cheap is the best way I could put it"}
{"text":"Service was great! Four cheese white pizza was absolutely the bomb. Also had the bruschetta and Caesar salad which was magnificent. Will definitely be hitting up any Grimaldi's that I come across in my ventures!"}
{"text":"Yeah so lost two stars for two major reasons the first, it took 30 minutes for the waiter to come to simply give us menus and take our drink orders. 30 minutes!!! And the second the food is decent not a fan and maybe it's because I'm from the east coast and all types of pizza are just done better here, but I travel to Phoenix a lot and I just don't think I'll be coming back to this restaurant...ever. There were fruit flies all over the place and it just was a bad experience."}
{"text":"We went here twice during spring training/spring break last week- it was THAT good! I'm hungry now just thinking about their delicious pizza. Both times we got a table without waiting, although it was very crowded- a good sign.   The first time, my daughter and I shared a meatball and mushroom pizza with tomato sauce. The crust is fabulous! She liked folding it over to eat \"new york style\" so I tried that too and it actually did make it thicker and chewier- may have started a new tradition in eating style. Ha. Hubby and son shared a pepperoni and it was equally good. The pepperonis are miniature in size, but great in quantity used, and cooked perfectly where they crisp up a bit on the edges. Yum!  The second trip, son and I decided to try the ricotta cheese pizza without red sauce (they use garlic and olive oil instead), and the server recommended sausage and onion. We got sausage and mushroom (I would have gotten onion too, but for the boy). Oh my gosh. Heavenly!!!!! Loved the ricotta combo. Hubby and daughter enjoyed pepperoni and meatball with red sauce.   We shared a large Caesar both times, which was plentiful. I would have preferred trying one of their other salads, but oh well. Gave in for the sake of the family.   The staff was pleasant and friendly both times as well. The manager came over and talked with us the second trip, when he saw my son's lacrosse tshirt- struck up a lax conversation. Fun. Oh- and our server the first time told us we got $5 off because of our hotel, and the hotel shuttle took us and picked us up. Double bonus.  We will DEFINITELY be back here on our next trip to Scottsdale! I can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, honestly my mouth is watering just writing this review. By far, the best pizza place in town (and it doesn't make me feel guilty, since it's all super thin crust!)  All of their toppings are great, not to mention the sauce! For a lighter day, their salads are also very , very good! They're staff is also always very nice."}
{"text":"What can I say - I just love this place and their food.  We usually get a salad before our special pizza.   It's reasonably priced.  The bar area seems to always thrive with thirsty patrons.  The dining area was thoroughly populated as well.   The staff was friendly and gave my recently born twin grandsons onesies with \"Grimaldi's Pizza\" written on them!   They will be fans too I'm sure!  :)"}
{"text":"Truly the best pizza I've had so far in AZ. Reminded me of NY pizza, thin crust... and crusty! I could eat this crust alone it's so good!..   In fact I did!!! Ate it with a little olive oil and it was yuyuyummy! Also had the antipasti, so glad they actually give you REAL antipasti and not a mesh of crazy salad... you have to try this place if you haven't already.  My husband and I got a small pizza and had enough to take home for leftovers... and we are BIG eaters! RICO!!!"}
{"text":"I am not a pizza snob. To me Pizza Hut, Papa Johns, Dominos, etc. is sufficient to satisfy my pie cravings. Thus I am usually hesitant to hit up actual pizza restaurants. Unless the place offers personal pizzas, you have to negotiate toppings with whoever you are sharing with. And I am sure we all have that friend who thinks anchovies is a must have. On top of that, pizza restaurants are comparably overpriced compared to their take-out/delivery siblings.  With that in mind Grimaldi's serves up some pretty good pizza, but to me fails to impress. Their ingredients are for the most part better than their chain counter parts. The pizzas aren't greasy or heavy, in fact, they only seem to have thin crust pizzas (no deep dish for chi-town peeps). They are a bit overpriced for what you get, and considering that they don't offer any custom or specialties pizzas, I'm left wondering I just overpaid for a simple pepperoni pizza.  I wish they had some more stand out ingredients or maybe a signature combo. I've been to this spot a few times and the service is pretty average. The patio is a nice touch but the restaurant itself is pretty small. Call ahead on the weekends as most pizza joints have a slower turn-over time and get packed on busier days."}
{"text":"Classic NY pizza place interior design with a modern twist.  A bit of wood, metal & stone.  They have a lovely outdoor dining area, with no smoking allowed, about 10 tables I think .  Also, there is a bar where you can sit either inside or out (there's a large rolling shutter that opens up).  Oh & there is absolutely no gaming.  If you ask me, that's a major plus!  As mentioned a small menu, but how many choices do you need with pizza that tasty?  We shared a small pizza- 1/2 pesto 1/2 white with meatballs, sausage, ricotta & roasted red peppers.  I preferred the pesto pizza, a lot more flavor & zestiness.  It was just crispy enough too.  Not too charred on the bottom, which is what I don't like about wood-fired or coal oven pizza.  It was really quite good.   I can't wait to go back & try the calzones.  I may have to join the gym first, as I see me being very addicted to this place...  Update 6/3/08: The calzones rock.  Be careful of the service it has been quite good to so poor that I actually complained to a manager..."}
{"text":"I always rated all my visits to Grimaldis 5 stars. In this instance, Thanksgiving 2017, I give it 3 stars. Nothing fatal, just the pizza did not come out piping hot and not as crispy as other times. This is a Vegas staple though so we will be back, here or the one at the Venetian."}
{"text":"This year I was in Las Vegas 4 times, from L.A. I went here 3 times, the other location at the Fashion Mall, once. Always great thin crust NY style pizza, hot and crispy. Price is very reasonable. I wish they had spaghetti so I can truly have my Italian dream meal, I call \"FESTA ITALIANA\", but alas, only pizza.  This review is for the Nov 2015 visit. A VEGAS MUST. Friendly staff, clean environs, excellent pizza!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, lovely atmosphere and delicious pizza ... and salads. A find in Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered a small thin crust pepperoni to go from Grimaldi's on Thursday night. Let's just say the pizza was so good that I had to write a short testimony. I know I'm 2 days late, but after seeing the receipt just now, I had to drop a review just to show Grimaldi's some love.  Their pizzas are cooked in a brick oven. I had a beer waiting on my pizza at the bar. The atmosphere was vibrant and full of fun. The staff was energetic and always smiling. I'll definitely go back, next time to dine in."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here today. We ordered a small pizza, which is 16\" and enough for two to share. We just got cheese and spinach and it was cooked perfect. Our server Krystal was nice and knowledgable. We sat out in the lovely courtyard. The only downside was the music they play, but oh well. Definitely a place we will visit again if ever in Old Town."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good pizza place to dine in while walking around the strip and I feel like we got the best experience we could have at Grimaldi's. Our server was incredibly friendly and told us that they messed up our pizza and because of that, we got the pizza they accidentally cooked for free along with our initial pizza that was ordered.   Any fan of pizza will be incredibly satisfied with their time spent here. Enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Was hoping for some good pizza it was OK,pretty disappointed.  Service was great just not a big fan of the pizza."}
{"text":"Always you can count on tasty coal brick oven pizza. I like to add extra fresh Basil on thin crast pizza, great flavor!"}
{"text":"A sure fan of the Pizza, but as a local and once regular patron, I have to say the entire atmosphere has gone blah.    We stopped going for a bit because we were treated unfairly since we were picky about the pizza being well done.  It got to be too much for us to handle being treated less than a deserving customer, but after some few months gone we had decided to try it again.  The food in general was always good back in NewYork and Vegas, but Scottsdale locations we have tried have some challenges.  At the very least, they could try and make it up in some kindness, but instead we have been ignored like we are less than deserving of service.  We have now gone back twice and have left being treated less than human and at the very least respectful for being a customer....except for Caroline tonight who came through and waited on us.  We always sit at the bar and it is obvious nobody wants to serve us.  Also, we never even get greeted hello, goodbye, or thank you as other customers are treated.   Well, it was so sad.  What has this world come to?  Ashley, wha in the world did we ever do to you?  Last week we thought you were just overwhelmed, but tonight you clearly ignored us.  We tried eye contact, a smile, and a hello, but you completely dissed us like were were garbage.   NOBODY deserves this.  If your company wants to refuse us service than just do that and save us from hurt feelings feeling less than worthy of your service.  This is what discrimination feels like and I am so glad I have never done this to anyone ever in my 56 years of age."}
{"text":"This location is conveniently placed inside the Palazzo on the second floor, by all the other restaurants and shops. This is the only Grimaldi's I've been to, so I can only speak for this location, but I enjoy the environment of this Grimaldi's.  My family and I were seated quickly and greeted friendly by the server. Unlike other pizza places like Sammy's Woodfire Pizza, they only serve pizza and salads, there are no other entrees, so be forewarned. I'm always a big fan of the normal pizzas, but they do have a white pizza that I heard was delicious as well. You order whatever additional toppings you want on your pizza for a certain price per topping on the whole or half of the pizza, adding each topping is the same price for both. In my opinion, the toppings could be a little cheaper since you are paying upwards of $18 for a large pizza and you can easily throw on three toppings and pay $25 for a pizza. The pizza itself is quite delicious though, so it's a nice treat once in a while. The pizzas are thin and can easily fall once you pick it up, so if you need to, use two hands or cut up the beginning portion with a fork until you get about halfway, where it is safe to pick up without falling. Our server that we had was really nice and was helpful to us to make our experience complete and amazing. This wouldn't be my everyday place to eat pizza, but this is a nice place to eat at every once I a while."}
{"text":"I am local and have only recently started going here. The pizza is excellent and the staff is top-notch. I have sat in the bar both times and will continue to do so on return trips. The bartenders are awesome. They were super helpful with both food and drink suggestions. It can get busy but they still take great care of everyone. We were there Sunday afternoon and there were many people in from the Marathon and in town for the car shows but there was still space at the bar for us and the bartenders were very attentive. This place is in such a great location with yummy pizza and an awesome bar staff, I just wish I would not have taken so long to try it. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Grimaldis has the best pizza I ever tried. The bad part is they have set the bar and every other pizza restaurant we go to is horrible in comparison. We always get a large sausage and onion every time. Now I'm getting hungry just writing this!!!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza!  The only reason it is not a 5?  Lack of dusting thoroughly!  There is a lot of trim and frames and stuff that gathers dust and it is never completely dust free.  The glass looked great this time though! Still - my favorite pizza."}
{"text":"So, we consistently went to Grimaldi's every Wednesday evening.  Have not been there for a while....due to inconsistency.  We always had great management, bartenders (Keith), and waitresses.  Went last Wednesday evening.  Too bad the Health Inspectors were not there.  There was no soap in the family bathroom. I told an employee and our waitress.  I was told by one (not our waitress, she was awesome), just go to another bathroom. He was not going to even fix it.  It just needed a battery.  So, people are just walking in and out of the bathroom without washing hands.  Gross!!!!     Told our amazing waitress.  She went to her manager.  Manager did not even come and talk to us.  Eventually rectified the situation and the manager did not even have the decency to let us know it was taken care of (she asked the waitress to tell us).  What ever happened to customer service.        Not done...The whole area where the pizzas are made (it is an open area) was taken apart.  All of the compartments were taken out and it was a disaster.  Not sure why.  This is at 7:30 or so in the evening.  Why???  We had our pizza.  Awful!!  It was not cooked completely and was such poor quality. No toppings.   I don't think I can ever go back.  Just can't  do it!!!          We had not gone back for some time...management always took care of us. We all make mistakes...just fix it.   This establishment was always so busy.  Every time we go now it is pretty much empty. We now know why.  Since we were regulars, I feel confident in saying what I am saying.   I will not be back. It really is too bad.  It was such an amazing place.  I do not see it making it in Summerlin; unless they get their act together."}
{"text":"So I have had the distinct pleasure of having eaten at the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn many times. As far as that goes...hands down the best pizza on earth. I have traveled extensively thru Italy and Spain and as a kid my parents owned a pizza joint. I feel like I have a pretty good palate for picking a winner. Which brings us to Grimaldi's Las Vegas. I have visited this location a handful of times and only today realized that I really like this place. As other reviewers mentioned, it's not particularly cheap. You can't get great pizza for Pizza Hut prices. Today I also realized that the service there is really good. I also appreciate they carry Lavazza coffee and when they refill your cup they bring you a whole new fresh cup from the kitchen instead of just \"topping you off\".  The people seem genuinely friendly and the place is very clean and open. I see a lot of families there having a nice meal which is great to see these days.  Next time you want a good pie with quality ingredients, give them a whirl. Plus let's face it $25 for a large pizza isn't the most expensive meal you're ever going to have!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza....I don't like the pay per topping deal but I get it. Sauce is supper tasty (I always add more to my pizza....but this too, you have to pay for). Service is always great...and they have some of the best wine specials in town (summer time half price wine on Tuesdays) Can't wait for my next cheat day pizza day."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's as a whole is 5 STARS but this location is a 3. We waited forever for this location to open, when It finally did we were excited to go.  We went on a weeknight and didn't have to wait long but were taken to a dark corner over by the bar. Our waiter didn't talk to us for like 10 minutes and the people at the bar were S faced and grabbing people.  This place is cramped. The design is terrible. Its a U shaped layout with the kitchen in the middle. Even though this new location is like 2 minutes from my house we will make the trek to the Alma School/Queen Creek location. And I recommend the same."}
{"text":"What can I say it's thin, hot, crunchy and taste good. Nice quality pizza."}
{"text":"Dirty dishes ... half of the plates at our table were dirty.    Gross.  Really gross.  The pizza and salad tasted good however.  But it took them a really long time to bring the pizzas out.  Will be difficult to go back to this location due to the dishes and abnormally long time to get food."}
{"text":"Love the service, love the people, love the food. Always a great pizza here and always fast. The managers are on it and work hard to create a fun and enjoyable environment."}
{"text":"Let me tell you something.  This place was marvelous!!  After a long day at Red Rocks we were so ready to get some grub!  This place hit the spot.  Everything was so fresh and full of flavor!  The service was prompt and friendly too!  I wish this pizza was in Houston!!  My only regret was not having a bigger tummy!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful first visit to Grimaldi's! The service and food were phenomenal. So yummy that we brought our leftovers home on the plane to MN!! Rihanna (server) and David (manager) genuinely wanted my husband and I to have an amazing experience. We will definitely go back to Grimaldi's when we return to Vegas this spring!!!"}
{"text":"very very tasty pizza, expensive yes but i enjoyed every bite :]  .. still not as good as original grimaldis in Brooklyn but close enough."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, we love Grimaldi's pizza!  This week we went for lunch, and I \"dared\" to order something different- a meatball Calzone.  I wouldn't order it again.  There wasn't a lot of marinara that came with it, and it seemed to lack something.  I only ate 1/2 and asked for an extra side of marinara.   My caesar salad contained several  wilted greens.  Honestly, within an hour I had an upset stomach.... and you know what came next.  I was the only one of our group to order those 2 items, and the only one to end up with an upset stomach.  Maybe it was the heat?   On a positive, everyone loved their pizza and the ice tea was so fresh!   We'll still go back, but I'm sticking with the delicious pizza!"}
{"text":"A really good thin crust pizza! We ordered a large with garlic sauce, topped it with mushrooms, Italian sausage, meatballs and artichoke hearts. We also ordered the Caesar salad, which was perfectly dressed. Between the three of us, we still had 3 slices left.  The service is also great, all the employees were very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I'm picky about is my Pizza.  I grew up in Italy spoiled with good pizza everywhere, so if you like deep dish, cheese crust or any other pizza gimmick stop reading right now!  Grimaldi's has been my favorite pizza place in town for years, thin crust, high quality ingredients and most importantly of all, consistency.  Every visit has been great and the food even better. Some may say it's pricey for pizza but you definitely get what you paid for."}
{"text":"Great lunch!  Started with the watermelon rocket salad-salad was fresh, crisp arugula, cucumbers, and sweet watermelon.  Pizza with sausage and pepperoni, thin crust, hit the spot. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Let me get this  out of the way, the website is a hot mess.  Pizza here is almost as good as the NYC location. Betting the water is the difference. Seriously, it does affect taste. That aside, prices are great. Kind of sad they have given in and use Hormel products vs making their own (or using higher quality ones).  Ok wtf, charging for extra sauce? And at $2? Tsk tsk."}
{"text":"The best white and garlic pizza I have the favor in the crust with the cheese you do not miss the sauce. Also the calzone is like butter with the blend of cheese. In every bite you know it is made fresh. it is just a great pizza joint."}
{"text":"In my 43 years on the planet Earth, this is the best pizza I've ever had. The toppings are delicious and plentiful, and it's the first pizza where I actually look forward to eating the refrigerated leftovers the next day. It is pricey ($26 plus tax for my preferred pie), but you WILL know where the extra money went when you sit down and eat.  PS: If anyone's interested, I recommend the 16'' with pepperoni, spicy chicken sausage, garlic, mushrooms and black olives. YUM!"}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant 20 stars if i could. Do yourself a favor and go here. Not only is the food tasty, the atmosphere is relaxing on a hot afternoon. It's set into the Venetian hotel and the walk there is breathtaking. The service inside is the best I've ever had. Victor took amazing care of us. He made wine suggestions, asked how our food tasted, kept our drinks full, created the romantic atmosphere we asked for to celebrate, and did it all with genuine care. I truly believe that if a single thing had been wrong, which it was all perfect, he would not have ceased until we felt it was right. Thank you Vincent."}
{"text":"We take a trip down to the Phoenix area every year around spring time to catch a spring training game and escape the cold Minnesota winters. Every time we are here I beg to go to Grimaldis for their amazing pizza!  This time we had a group of seven people, and when we put our name in on a Saturday night at 7PM they told us it would be over an hour wait. Which was no big deal! We walked to the brewery a couple blocks down, and when we sat down with our beers (20 minutes later) I got a message saying our table was ready! We slammed our beers and ran to the restaurant to grab our table!  We had an incredible waiter who helped us through the menu and we ended up ordering three large pizzas - the Don, The Brooklyn Bridge, and ordered a custom pesto and grilled chicken. It was the perfect amount for all of us and the pizza (as always) was incredible.  This place has great atmosphere, superb staff, and is perfect for families, date nights or even large parties of hungry 24 year-olds!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had! I've had New York pizza many times and this pizza melts in your mouth every time! My fiancé and I ordered a small pepperoni, meatball and onion pizza that we couldn't even finish. The service was fantastic and we will be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the waiters are always fun, nice and attentive.  The pizza is just ok but nothing special.  I judge a great pizza by the crust and this is pretty run of the mill.  The best pizza in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area is Pomo and Andreoli when they serve it."}
{"text":"The pizza might be great, but so far the customer service leaves a lot to be desired. Dirty bar, which even after I asked to be wiped by the hostess, she said somebody will in a sec, even though she was doing nothing  at the time. We waited ten minutes to even be acknowledged, then another ten to be served water on the dirty bar. After 25 minutes of waiting for just our drink order to be taken, we left hungry and frustrated. I can't imagine what the service would have been like being busy! Management needs to train their staff."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is now offering a lunch special, Monday through Friday, from 11am to 3:30pm. It's such a great deal, I had to update my review about it. I was able to get a 'lunch size' pepperoni pizza for $5.49 and a Pepsi for $2.50. Grand total? $7.99+ .73 tax = $8.72   I can't eat at Wendy's or Arby's or Long John Silvers this cheaply and Grimaldi's tastes much better is much fresher!  Grimaldi's doesn't advertise this lunch special. I have no idea why. It's a nice little secret value if you know about it. The lunch size pizza is smaller (9\") and much cheaper than the personal pizza (12\") offered on the normal menu. You aren't going to be stuffed by it, but you won't be leaving hungry, either. It's the perfect portion size for one person at lunch, in my opinion.  Of course, the staff are always great and the restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere (everything I mentioned in my previous review still applies.)"}
{"text":"Disappointing this time. Waitress was less than friendly. The pizza was lacking in the 2 sides we ordered.  The amount of sausage was miniscule. This was not the pizza we were used to at this restaurant . The wine was good but way overpriced for the small serving. The pizza itself was not the usual. Perhaps it was the holiday that influenced the. Poor quality."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! Tried the bruschetta trio and even got the kids to eat it. Always happy when they try something different. Had the Margarita pizza, traditional mushroom and traditional pepperoni pizzas. Almost finished all three. So yummy, great New York style pizza! Even gave the boys pizza dough to play with while we waited for our food."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy your pizza, but upon my last visit noticed a \"no firearms\" sticker on your door. While it is asinine to believe that a sticker would keep bad guys out, it is within your right to decide not to welcome customers who legally and lawfully carry firearms in accordance with local law. However, since my right and ability to protect myself and family is more important to me that your pizza, I will no longer patronize your business, and actively discourage friends and associates from giving you their business."}
{"text":"Staff was nice and the pizza came out very quickly. Sauce was OK and everything seemed very fresh.  The crust is a hand tossed thin crust New York pizza(the original is in New York). With all that said it was good but nothing crazy great. I would eat here again with no complaints but I don't think I would ever crave it.  I had a meatball, mushroom pie. The 2 star rating is not meant to be a dig but I just didn't think it was anything special. I can't believe this is really the best pizza in New York as they claim."}
{"text":"They have really good thin wood fired pizza. It is on the higher price side but they have a great lunch special here. You get a mini pizza, salad and drink for $8. Can't beat the price"}
{"text":"We travel to Scottsdale a couple of times a year and we always go to Patsy Grimaldi's Pizzeria for date night dinner.  The pizza is fabulous and the salads are awesome.  I was expecting it to be a bit over the top since it's in Old Town, but every time we go for dinner, it's great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and a cool vibe especially for the kids. Totally family friendly but they give you \"adult pizza\". Great quality with fresh ingredients and good service"}
{"text":"Eh, pizza was pretty bland.  Sauce had no taste, disappointed was really looking forward to NY pizza.   Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Great pizza.Good staff.one of my favourite places.thank you Calzone was great.i recommend."}
{"text":"A little pricey for pizza. For example, to add mushrooms, green onions, chicken spicy saugage its costs an extra $2-$4...They are known for pizza, salad,  beer, wine and that is pretty much it! The restaurant is a little small; however the customer service is good here. Also the pizza is great!  Key Bentley's Recommendation: I recommend this establishment the pizza is fresh and tasty..."}
{"text":"Don't expect to be in and out quickly... takes a bit to cook the pie but it's pretty good. Sat at the bar to eat with the girl because it was too busy to wait for a table so maybe our service was different but the girl was very nice and on top of things.  Being a Chicago kid... the pizza was good, better than most in Az but not better all.  Forgot what the cost was but wasn't that cheap."}
{"text":"This place is located central downtown old Scottsdale. Great place for some fantastic Pizza, great service and not so loud atmosphere. On tap is a pretty good selection of craft and domestic beer."}
{"text":"Ahh!! Okay, so I'm a little sick of Pizza -- but I'm always down to try different places, especially in Vegas! Maribel T. took us here to meet up with her cousin and her husband. It was a Saturday night, luckily they weren't busy that we got seated right away. The pizza was huge, Maribel T., her sister and I shared a small which was plenty for 3 people to share. We added sausage, mushroom and pesto. It was so yummy and I love thin crust pizza. The slices are pretty big as well, eating one slice is actually eating two slices. I also loved their Mediterranean salad. Our waiter was good, he explained the menu well and the portions.   Also, if you have a kid with you ask for pizza dough for the kids to play with. My nephew had too much fun with the dough. :)"}
{"text":"It's better than Secret Pizza, which is why I had to go with 4 stars, as it would've been unfair to give them 3, although an argument can probably be made for that.  But, based on the prices and fact this is in the Fashion Show Mall, I don't think I'd recommend going anywhere else there for a bite.  Forget about the food court overflowing with 2 star options.  There's Neiman Marcus with its own restaurant, and places like Maggianos and The Capital Grille too, but those are obviously in a different price range with a totally different experience.  Here, I got a personal pizza (12 inches) that starts at a $9 price point, then goes up a couple bucks depending on what toppings you add.  I think that this size could actually be shared among 2 people if you wanted to.  It's thin and saucy, and the portion of cheese to crispy crust is well balanced.  It's a cute little place, I sat at the bar but looked around at the brick walls, the fireplace, all the photos, and of course the red and white checkered tablecloths.  So it's not just some impersonal generic pizza joint in a mall.  When I think of Grimaldi from this point forward, instead of Morocon royalty instantly coming to mind, I think it's just as likely I'll be thinking of some pizza."}
{"text":"Really good wood fired-pizza! Perfectly buttery crust, nice char, crsipy yet doughy, it's got a really great balance. It's got a classic pizza taste and the aroma is amazing.   If you dine-in you'll be treated to a lovely restaurant with old world, New York charm. You'll find yourself imersed in the decor as the place boasts checkered table cloths, brick walls, subway signs, repurposed wine bottle chandeliers and rat pack tunes on the radio. Definitely recommend it, its should be one of your go to spots."}
{"text":"Just went to a movie on my day off and wanted something light and yummy they have a great spinach salad and make sure you add cooked pepperoni"}
{"text":"Best pizza varies from person to person. Some people like deep dish Chicago-style others prefer a brick oven thin crust. I prefer thin crust like Grimaldis. I tried this place because I saw a lot of people waiting to be seated so I put two and two together and figured this would be worth a look. Okay so the pizza is pretty awesome but the real MVP is the calzone. It is served with a tangy marinara sauce. They are not stingy with the cheese. The pizza is full of flavor and by far my favorite from any other pizzeria. The cons are the wait don't show up hungry because you will be quite hangry. The pizza crust can sometimes scratch the roof of your mouth; beware and eat slowly. Oh one more thing if you sign up with them online you get a free pizza on your birthday. Love this place!"}
{"text":"2nd bad review I'm writing for this specific grimaldis. I left my phone on the table after lunch and came back about 30-40 minutes after leaving to find it and the hostesses hadn't seen it. Came back after checking another location we had been and left a description of the phone with a name and number to call if it was found. Finally had verizon track it and they located it at the restaurant, it wasn't until we showed the hostesses that the phone was in fact at the restaurant, that they went and fetched the manager. The manager says \"oh the busser brought it to me as soon as the table was cleared, I'll go grab it.\" She comes back and gives me my phone, and when I explain that she needs to communicate with the host stand since thats the first place anyone would check for a lost item, she got incredibly rude. Not to mention, our service was very slow and poor for how dead the restaurant was. Would not eat at this branch ever again."}
{"text":"First time at Grimaldi's I loved the Mediterranean salad. I highly recommend the white cheese pizza it was delicious n the Italian sausage mushrooms n olives was great too.  I usually don't like thin crust pizza but Grimaldi's thin crust was  excellent it wasn't dry n the flavor mmmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! We were seated right away and our server was nice. We started off with a caprese salad and a small caesar salad. Just FYI , The small salad is big enough to feed two. Next time we come I won't order two salads because I got full from the two. We ordered a small white sauce with garlic, spicy chicken, meatballs and mushrooms. The pizza had good flavor and I loved the little kick of spice from the spicy chicken. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Amazing NY style pizza! It's our absolute favorite! The crust, sauce, cheese, ratios, oh my goodness just try it, it's perfect!"}
{"text":"Not our best visit today.  Out of the bottled beer we prefer and the restaurant needs a good deep cleaning. We sat at the bar on the patio and the outdoor TV was dirty and the vents are black. Used the restroom and was disgusted.  Pizza and service was good."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the salad and pizza. While the pricing isn't inexpensive I feel you get what you pay for. Service was good and outside seating very pleasant."}
{"text":"I've been here a ton of times and am always happy with my pizza here! Everything tastes so fresh, definitely different than the other pizza places in the area. One awesome thing about grimaldis is that they send you a coupon for a free large pizza with one topping for your birthday. Pretty awesome! Also my mom has mild celiacs and was happy to see that they have gluten free crust now. They also have some good wines! Not the best appetizer selection but the pizza is all ya really need! Always busy here but I've always had good servers here. Expensive but worth it for an occasional treat!"}
{"text":"I love Grimaldis! I always get the Calzone with pepperoni and sausage and extra cheese! The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is because their credit card machine broke down and we were literally sitting there for an hour waiting to pay."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's blows competition like Spinatos, Venezia,  NYPD Pizza out of the water.  Good service, quality ingredients, a decent sauce, etc.  It's no John's Pizzaria, but I can't fly to NYC every time I want a decent slice of pizza."}
{"text":"I don't get it. I suppose people that live in wealthy neighborhoods will buy, eat and RAVE about anything that is in their \"side of town\". Lets get real. The pizza here was not only not good, but it was an expensive not good! The crust. Supposedly made with water from NY....Ok... ??? It was charred and burnt. So who cares? Sauce? I'm not sure if there was any on there but if there was, it had No flavor at all. Cheese? What was there was cooked to complete dry papery bubbles. All I can tell you is that it was white. The pepperoni? Thick and Dime sized??? That is NOT Italian! One basil leaf dried out to a crisp in the middle of the pizza... Why?  I could throw a Pillsbury biscuit topped with ketchup and Kraft cheese in a fire pit and have it taste better than this stuff!  Oh... and this restaurant doesn't serve ranch dressing. Wow. People, this is just another chain restaurant with a gimmick. Get over being suckered. Go get a real pizza, have you been to Montesanos?... Or Villa on Sahara and Valley View? How bout Metro?... The noise level and the super bright lighting alone should be all the deterrent you need to turn heel and scram from this place. Not to mention the parking! OMG!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered Brooklyn Bridge Pizza. It was good but a little pricey. Service was good too. Plenty of parking spaces for free at front."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! $$ is false advertising. $38.00 for one pizza to go, that was half the weight of the normal pizza's we usually order from Spinato's and Rosati's. The meat was poor quality, ordered both sausage and pepperoni. Dry, sinewy and just plain awful!!! The onions were raw and too big. They charged $4. extra for artichokes and $4. extra for red peppers and the pepper slices were 1/4 thick and 1\" long, there were about 4 bits on the whole pizza of all the extras we ordered for the 18\" pizza. I would have preferred an AJ's or even a Bashas pizza than this Rip-Off. No wonder the place is dead. Save your money."}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas for a little over a year and I can honestly say Grimaldi's has the best pesto pizza hands down! I got the personal for $10 and had left overs! The caesar salad is also pretty yum.   The service is always top notch, the pizza is consistently aHh-MaZiNG, and it's only a 7 minute drive from the hale.  I gotta say... Grimaldi's coupled with Sambalatte enhances the experience by 10x's.   Got a new favorite pizza joint, YES! =)"}
{"text":"Always love coming here. Pizza and service is great. If you get a chance sit outside, always great in nice weather"}
{"text":"The service was great we were greeted with a friendly smile and our server was quick and attentive.  We shared a caprese salad and pizza.  The caprese was good and hit the spot.  The pizza was good too.  I liked the crunchy crust but it was a little dry.    We asked for some ranch and we were lectured on the fact that \"real pizza\" isn't served with ranch and they don't carry it.  Look, I understand that ranch on your pizza isn't for everyone but it chaps my hide when restaurants try to dictate how patrons should eat their meals.  The first I heard of this is when steakhouses refused to serve A-1 with their steaks because it was an insult to their perfectly prepared meat.  Seriously?  I think it's a testament to your food when you offer the condiments and the meal is good enough to stand on its own, but let the person eating the meal decide on that.  What's next, ketchupless fries?"}
{"text":"you can't beat grimaldi's personal pizza with basil, onion, and meatball.  find a better combo and let me know.  peroni on tap - cold as hell.  no qualms here.  i'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Was in vegas for a few days leading up to the New Years and was looking to punch some carbs into the stomach after a long night of frolicking and drinking on the strip. Grimaldi's has been popping up all over the grid in the US but obviously is the Brooklyn establishment. It is a consistent experience and definitely a tasty one well worthy of their chains across the US. Was in the venetian and making the rounds around through the palazzo and remembered this joint was there and figured it would be the perfect meal to \"Carb up\". We showed up right at opening time and were seated immediately.   The server was friendly throughout the experience and was attentive to all of the items we needed. The restaurant itself has some seats on the \"patio\" which allows people to watch those walking around the casino and spots on the inside of the restaurant. The menu is broken into pizza (custom or specials), starters, desserts, and salads. Simple and classic dishes all around and for this trip decided to go with the Caprese salad and the Don which is their meat lovers pizza. The service as mentioned was quick and within minutes we had the Caprese salad. The portion is ginormous and obviously a simple dish with fresh basil mozzarella and balsamic vinaigrette. It was perfectly refreshing and took off the guilt of knowing I was about to break my diet and ingest a ton of carbs. The don was not too far off and this thing is loaded with sausage, meatballs, and pepperoni. The crust is nice and flaky and this is the solid thin crust pizza style. There was a good amount of char from the coal oven and the ingredients were plentiful and of good quality.   All in all, a solid stop and you know the consistency to expect from a Grimaldis. This is certainly a welcome joint on the strip and one of my spots where i know I can carb up."}
{"text":"Their pizza is very good. I love the fresh cheese they use. I am also a fan of all their salads. They have a full bar, which is always a plus. The outside patio is small but nice and faces one of the main roads throught the SanTan mall. It has always been clean.  My only negative comment is that sometimes the host's have attitude problems and are not good at getting people seated. The wait staff has always been nice."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, there's plenty of pizza places to choose from. I've had some pretty bomb pizza over the years, and I can honestly say that this is one of the best pizzas I've ever had. While I'm still not sure if it's better than Pop Up Pizza in Downtown (I have to do a side-by-side comparison one day), it definitely ranks up high on the best of Vegas list. Just a few minor hiccups. It was a bit pricey, and the wait was pretty long even though it wasn't too busy. Our server was very nice though. I'll definitely visit again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love grimaldis.  Great thin crust pizza and salad."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good pizza and you want to avoid the high prices if the LV Strip, this place is for you.  It's located in the Mall across from Trump Hotel.  The crust is perfect!  Crispy with the perfect blend of chewiness. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Quality NY style thin crust pizza in Old Town Scottsdale.  Food: 4.5, Service: 4, Atmosphere: 3.5 Cost to worth it rating: 3 (bit pricy for shared small salad, small pizza, and sodas for bit under $40) Return worthiness: yes  Highlights: - Pizza: nice crispy and chewy thin crust, fresh tomato sauce, and quality meats. Bonus for meatballs as a topping. - Variety: can choose red (tomato), white (olive oil), or green (pesto) on pizzas and few versions of salads to start. - Wine by the glass: long list though just ok quality mainstream choices  Lowlights: - Sizing: 2 people is a bit much for a small with 6 big slices. We could've easily shared what they called a personal--and we're not light eaters. - Didn't have room for cheesecake and the amaretto one looked great.  Enjoyed this pizza and would have it again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my family.  Didn't have a problem getting a table for 8.  We ordered 3 large pizzas. 1. Half Cheese/Half Pepperoni for the kids. 2. White garlic with ricotta, meatballs, basil, and Italian sausage. 3. Italian sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, olives, and onions.  The pizza was so good that we cleaned everything up.  It was pretty hot inside the restaurant, I'm not sure if the AC was not working well.  It was loud too, a bit hard to have a conversation.  Our server came back a few times to see how we liked the food and if we needed anything else.  We have ordered take out here before, that one was good as well but I think it is better when you enjoy it at the restaurant while it's still hot."}
{"text":"The Boyfriend and I indulged in a date night and of course we chose or favorite place, Grimaldis! I wanted to update my review because once again we had a perfect experience. Bf wanted to try the spinach salad (I have a hard time not ordering the Caesar because it is my favorite), but the spinach was quite good. I appreciate that they never scrimp on the toppings.   Now to the good stuff... Pizza. This pizza is my absolute favorite. I have to hold myself from eating the whole pie! This time we ordered spicy chicken, sun dried tomatoes & spinach and I don't know if I'll ever ordered another variation. It was perfection!   I also love the Layer Cake Malbec and we couldn't leave without an order of cheesecake for takeout. So yummy! The service was great. Kimberly was very attentive & friendly. She got a little busy towards the end of our meal, but she communicated and made sure we had everything we needed. I'm so glad this place has been able to stay consistently delicious. Thanks Grimaldis, I can't wait for my next slice!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and I don't even like then crust awesome wine selection good cheese cake good salad I definitely recommend this place plus are server was awesome don't know his name but he was the guy with dreds"}
{"text":"PGP IS GREAT.   I love the DC Ranch location, it is a great place for a quick bite, grandmas dinner, first date or lunch meeting.   The service was on point, the food was excellent and we experienced some superb customer service.   I ordered a large pep for the two of us to share. They brought out a 14inch pizza which is 4 good sized slices each.   The waitress Jennifer mentions they made the wrong size, this is the medium and they will bring another one asap. We ate the medium and were happily stuffed just as another \"personal\" pizza arrived. It was a 12 inch pie. We boxed it and sent it home with the old coworker. He now has dinner tonight.   THAT IS GREAT SERVICE!   Jennifer did a great job keeping the drinks filled and the table clear."}
{"text":"Great service, food and atmosphere... why only 4 stars. The pizza was not as good as the Scottsdale site. it could be the ovens were not \"seasoned\" yet or it could be I had pizza for dinner the night before, and lunch the day of, then dinner here... but usually that would not be an issue.   We had 3 large pizzas and it feed 7 adults and 5 kids. (full but not stuffed) 1. Tomato and garlic EXCELLENT 2. Pep GREAT 3. Cheese MEH  The server was attentive, funny and nice."}
{"text":"I will say it is the BEST pizza in Las Vegas. And I am very picky with my pizza. I love the thin crust and how they put sauce over the pizza rather than under the cheese.. hmmm kinda like Chicago style. Nice. The only thing that sucked that it was cold when I brought it home. But still good.   The ingredients in my pizza usually consist of garlic, mushroom and certain veggies but since they did not have the other veggies I like I saw they had meatball which is not always on the menu. It was damn good meatball. yum yum... I love how they do not skimp out on the ingredients.   Like they say you want all your ingredients on half or whole same price.. so you might as well just get the whole pizza with your ingredients.   I can't say to much of the service but the ToGo area (bar) she was cool and friendly. And a worker opened the door for me when I was leaving to help me since I was holding the 18\" pizza. LOL   I will have to come back again.. See you next time Grimaldi's.. The closest thing to NY pizza in LV.."}
{"text":"Our one \"must stop\" place in Vegas. No matter where we stay, we have to have a Grimaldi's pizza. This branch is right between our two favorite hotels, so...score!  Perfect thin crust New York pizza. The wait staff has always been friendly and fun, and the food is worth a 3.5 hour drive. Get a basic pizza and stop with all the California crap. Ranch dressing for a pizza? Please. Good beer, good salad, excellent pie. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Stopped in for dinner a couple of days ago.  Seated quickly.  Attentive waiter.    Small pizza (pepperoni & sausage) with a lovely glass of red wine.  I was seated near the pizza oven and got to watch the guys making my pizza.  Fresh balls of dough hand stretched into the crust.  Plenty of toppings, cheese and just the right amount of sauce.  Coal fired oven was glowing red hot, pizza going in, out.  Time from being pulled from the oven, to being at the table was seconds.  The wait staff were lined up to deliver the pizza to the tables quickly.     My pizza was done perfectly.  One of the best I've had in a very long time.  I got to watch other folks ordering and eating, and they all had a satisfied look on their faces.  Clearly this is a local favorite.  Families, people out for a date, folks like me who just wandered in - all seemed pleased with their meals.  Place did get busy about 20 minutes after I got there, so I imagine if you go at peak times, there will be a wait.    Grimaldi's doesn't try to be all things to all people.  It does pizza, calzone and a couple of salads - and does them very well.  The wine list is reasonably inclusive and not over priced.  Plenty of seating inside and out.  Prices were reasonable.  Place was clean.  Service was excellent.  Total for the wine and more pizza than I could eat by myself, was $27.    Bottom line - Excellent pizza.  Go try it.  It's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best pizza places in Las Vegas. Superior taste and quality ingredients. Real east coast pizza."}
{"text":"A long overdue review, I've had sitting in my review box. Was here about a month ago. Had especially great service, and wanted to blast the extra great employees since people normally only name names when it's bad...this was not, they were, like I said, great!  Service:  We came on an oddly busy Tuesday, just two of us. The hostess, Kendal- I even remembered her name because she was so awesome - she was able to find us a table in good time. They were swamped and there was a huge group in front of us who were really pushy, we watched her handle them with grace & was still in a genuinely nice, friendly mood when it was our turn. Too many times I've experienced employees taking it out in me when business is busy, I was impressed by how she handled everyone.   We got to our table, and our server introduced himself, Steven. He suggested the Sangria. Sure, sounds great. I think he needed it more though, from the looks of how slammed they were!   Delivered waters quickly, delivered Sangrias. The rest of the our visit went on the same. Had my glass of Educated Guess (woohoo!) and they continued to do everything they should, pleasantly. He even took time to answer our questions, like are the dressing prepackaged, is the sausage made in house, etc... Answers were.... It's all made in house!  Before we left, the GM stopped by our table with a smile before we left, and genuinely wanted to know how everything was. Great! Love that attention to detail.  Food:  They always have seriously good pizza. When you want a Grimaldi's pizza, there is nothing that compares.  Don't miss their Italian Sausage. It's homemade, as are all of their salad dressings- Caesar, spinach, Caprese, you really can't go wrong.   I kind of love the simple menu concept, because they can focus on doing what they do and making it really fresh!  Decent enough wine list, sangria and mixed drinks. Go for the Educated Guess  Other details:  It can be a busy place so MAKE A RESERVATION on weekends.   They are limited on space but do a great job with what they have. Their staff have always been so hospitable, they even open the door for you as you walk in & open the door as you leave. A good company protocol, shows they are all about  hospitality! You will feel at home.  Hope they'll add a wine happy hour, would make me a more frequent customer"}
{"text":"Cosmopolitan Secret pizza can kiss this place's @$$ !!!   Grimaldi's, coming straight from NY, brings all of it's goodness straight to the Las Vegas Palazzo.  This place is open until 2am, so rejoice if you've finished clubbing by that time because this place will satisfy your hunger AND more.    If I had to compare it to the location in NY city, I'd say this place isn't as good (just a little bit less crisp), however, it is still one of THE best thin crust pizza places in the Westside of the United States.  There, I stamped it.    The crust here is crunchy, the cheese is packed with flavor, and the pepperoni + sausage is meat glory.  I suggest you don't order any veggies with it because it will just secrete water and ruin the pizza.  Keep it to these two toppings and you're in for a glorious treat.    5 stars all the way."}
{"text":"Location:  Grimaldi's is located by the front entrance of Palazzo hotel if you're walking along the strip. If you're inside Palazzo, look for the waterfall on the 1st floor and go up the escalator to the right. It's on the 2nd floor opposite direction of the waterfall.  Look for the exit/entrance to the Palazzo and it's right there!  What to get:  for a family of 4 with two toddlers, start with a large Cesar salad and get a large size pizza with meatballs and extra sauce. The pizzas have a really thin crust so its not as filling so it may not be enough for others. So yummy!  Although I still think Tony's Napoletano in SF is still #1 at the top of my list, this is still great!"}
{"text":"Omg the garden pizza was to die for talk about delicious, so coming back with the wifey."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. The cheese was beyond spectacular the pepperoni was so juicy. I strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok I'll start with the good, the pizza was tasty and the crust chewy (in a good way) but that's where it ends.   First of all they shouldn't offer carry out! There is nowhere to park when your picking up and the roadways are a nightmare on Saturday night!   The carry out pizzas are stored at the bar in (and I use the term 'in' loosely) one of those red insulated bags pizza delivery drivers use but it wasn't kept closed so what good is that? NONE! That's what good it is! I was probably 5 or 10 minutes later than the 45 minutes they quoted me and when I got home my pizza was barely luke warm!!   And then they had the audacity to call me and say I 'may have taken my pizzas without paying'!! I said 'I gave the guy at the bar my cash!' They said 'ok we'll check with him'.  REALLY?? You're going to call and accuse me of stealing without even checking with the guy handling the operation??! Never again will they get my business!!  Oh and they are highly overpriced!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and food. Love eating here.  The staff is always great .... except for one. Teresa!  Honey. You need to calm the f**k down with your attitude. I'm definitely not in the mood to get attitude from some little brat who thinks she can treat customers unkindly.  To show your customer that you're annoyed by simple questions, is a sign that you shouldn't be in the service industry.  Management needs to sit down with you. Or maybe you should go back to the fryer at McDonald's."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week and it was nice.  We ordered the Caesar salad and the waitress said the small was big enough to share.  It was, only if you aren't really hungry which we were but we appreciated her assisting us trying to be more economical.  For our pizza we ordered artichokes, sundried tomato, and onions.  We loved how thin the pizza was but there wasn't much crunch.  Maybe that was due to the amount of water in the vegetables which transferred to the crust.  Not really sure, but I do remember having crunchy vegetarian pizza.  Overall, the location and atmosphere was very pleasant and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"very good pizza; we were down here visiting from Seattle, and it bests whatever we have to offer in the 'emerald city'.  Just keepin' it real...  The crust was nice, crispy and thin, perfectly cooked.  Mozzarella cheese didn't come out of giant plastic package of shredded cheese, and the ingredients were fresh, the tomato sauce had just the right amount of flavor, and the italian sausage was nicely seasoned just right--not salty, not too spicy.  All in all, a delicious pizza at a eminently reasonable price.  Only potential downside is that there is no pre-set 'combination pizzas' (i.e.  you have to design your own), and that the price per topping is the same regardless of size of pizza you order..."}
{"text":"Ordered half pepperoni half cheese for pickup. Got home and it was all pepperoni. Not a big deal but for $22 I'll head elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar and Chad was awesome and definitely made our visit much more enjoyable. This place is a much more trendier and modern version of the Brooklyn location. Loved the ambience and the wine bottle pendant hanging lights. Pizza was good but I adjusted mine with a sprinkling of olive oil and a dash of salt. Chad recommended adding the basil after the pizza has been cooked. I didn't even know you can ask it that way but I'm glad we went with his recommendation. The fresh basil made it great and the were very generous with the basil. Totally worth the visit. If you have room for dessert, try the cheesecakes; light and easy to eat."}
{"text":"It was our 1st time at Grimaldi's and it did not disappoint.  Kale salad, greek salad and pepperoni pizza. The crust was amazing."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! The Don is my favorite and i normally get my stuff to go. Andria has always made my to go experience great because she checks in and is just genuinely friendly!  This location is nice and people keep to themselves for the most part."}
{"text":"At about 7 pm we arrive... a bunch of pilots, flight attendants and mechanics/maintenance ... about 14... they were able to seat us with in 10 minutes... i was stoked!!  we are all seated outside... it was such a beautiful night last night... it was soo nice! the waiter comes up... and says hi... but WE had to ASK him his name... and he was way to relaxed... not very outgoing at all... he gave me the feeling like we interrupted his \"Smoke\" break.... my bad   while we were waiting for our food i asked for some bread... they brought out a little plate of maybe 8-10 pieces of bread on it... keep in mind we all have not eaten since before noon that day... and we all looked at the plate like um.... o...k...   when the food FINALLY came i was soo excited... the whole place had smelled amazing since walking up from the parking lot!! (which was kinda small and packed) but i was quickly disappointed... the pizza was soo thin... the toppings fell right off the pizza.. and there was virtually no sauce at all!! :( the crust was the best part of the whole thing...   my friend and i decided to get a piece of cheesecake to hopefully save the meal... NOPE... not even close... i almost wanted to cry... cheesecake is my all time most favorite dessert and it was ruined!  the crust was waxy and just gross... the cake part tasted a little weird... kinda like the crust and to mushy.. like they didn't give it enough time to set.. it was awful...   their menu has salad appetizers, pizza and calzones... and desert.. that's it... no pastas or anything else so there isn't much to choose from... :( their water with lemon was my favorite part of the meal.. sad..   Over all.....  The bathrooms were decent..  Parking was not to great.. The food Sucked....  Service could have been WAY better....  and it was WAY OVERPRICED!!!!!!!!!!   if i ever go back... I'm just gonna order Water with extra lemon..."}
{"text":"We also had the white pizza with garlic and a pizza with half sausage and the other half basil and tomato.  Both were outstanding.  Overall this place has good food, service and atmosphere.  This place is good place to relax and enjoy. Get there early otherwise it's a wait"}
{"text":"Best this crust pizza we've ever had!!  Several specially options, be or you can put your own together. Large salads feed 4, and small is plenty for 2 (and I can eat!}. You MUST try the Don, and we order ours well done. They have garlic and oregano to sprinkle on top which just adds to the heat flavor. And Tuesday nights (I believe).... HALF PRICE WINE!!  Gotta check it out!!"}
{"text":"We were exhausted and looking for an inexpensive place in Vegas to get great food and we were more than pleasantly surprised.  The personal pizzas are the perfect size, and two of them could easily feed three people.  Also the house wine is quite good.  By far one of the better tasting and values you will find in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had. Fresh ingredients, not overloaded with too much cheese and grease, great thin crust that isn't like a tasteless cracker and isn't soggy. They get it right with the amount of topping and everything being so fresh and authentic. Their regular red sauce pizza is super flavorful and the sauce has a slight sweet taste. The white pizza is beyond amazing with chicken on it. The dining area is super loud at times and can get warm with all the people and oven going. They do offer outdoor dining that is shaded in the afternoons.They also have curbside pick up. Kids get pizza dough and a small pie plate to play with while waiting. The salads are always fresh and their dressings are great! The staff is always very nice and attentive. Decent wine list and refreshing passion iced tea. Their cheesecakes wont disappoint either :) Be aware that they restoke the oven coals around 4-430 everyday and don't take orders at that time."}
{"text":"I think that was the best pizza I've ever had. The sauce was outstanding and the cheese is wonderful. I got a large with pepperoni, mushroom, onion. One of my favorite combinations.   Also, go around 4-5 to get there before the crowds."}
{"text":"Yummy!   We got a house salad and added salami and mozzarella.  They were a little cheap with salami but it was delicious.  The dressing was awesome.   Then we got a small Brooklyn bridge pizza.  It was delicious!!!! Tasted like I was back in NYC.   Good pizza is hard to come by in vegas."}
{"text":"Yummy! Great location I might add.  Oh pizza - necter of the gods :)  I can eat pizza any day anytime.  It's one of those food that is fun and good - please do play with your food!  At Grimaldi's you create your own combination of toppings.  Yes, my friend use your imagination and go with it.  Needless to say, I rather enjoyed my pizza (Ricotta Cheese & Jalapenos) Though it was tad bit spicy, but I can dig.  Ambience is nice kitchenesque wine bar like.  Service was top!  This place can get pretty pricy though - the more topping the more dollars yikes!  However, definitely worth the visit - enjoy!"}
{"text":"This Grimaldi's is A~OK if your in the area looking for good pizza.  I usually rave about one of the other Girmaldi locations to my friends and since we were in the area we thought, why not try this Grimaldi's.  After all it's a Girmaldi's and the Patsy Girmaldi's in DC Ranch taste a like the Girmaldi's in New York.   We were a little concerned when we arrived since this place was very slow and it was during peak lunch time.  The service was ok not exceptional but good. I usually don't have to ask for a refill on my beverage at the other location, but here I did twice...  The decor of this Grimaldi's is very nice.  I found myself starring at the ceiling more than once thinking: \"better not bring my bride here; she'll want me to do this to our ceiling in the den\"!   Lunch~ antipasto salad. The fresh mozzarella was very good, oven roasted sweet red peppers were too cold and not seasoned, the salami was sliced very thin and offered only four pieces (lacking), some olives and some fresh baked bread.  The mozzarella and bread were the stars of this dish ~ everything else let you wanting more or something different.  Personal pizza ~ white garlic with fresh tomatoes.  For the first time ever I had to add salt to my pizza, what the heck? The crust was full of the deliciousness goodness I'm used to at Grimaldi's, crispy and scrumptious but the white cheesy and garlicky toppings needed more seasoning...  The calzones my colleagues had were delish and they ate everything in sight including the left over sauce from their calzones.  I would come back again but for dinner not lunch.  The bar area seemed to be the place to be in this location. This is where you want to sit so you can watch the pizza dough flying before they load it into their brick oven, have some beer or wine but order a different kind of pizza!"}
{"text":"Patsy Grimaldi's is one of the best kept secrets in Scottsdale!  It has truly original taste and really can't be compared to any other pizza in town.  Their pizza reminds us of good pizza from back east.  I like them better than Pizzeria Bianco in downtown Phoenix.  Grimaldi's pizza is just as good if not better, you get more for your money, your wait time to be served and 2 hours less and it's more kid friendly.     Their North Scottsdale location is tucked away in DC Ranch which creates a great ambiance for dinner with friends for a romantic night with a loved one. You can create just about any type of pizza or calzone you want. They use very fresh products and their service is outstanding.   The only thing that I found a bit annoying has nothing to do with the food, just that DC Ranch does not offer the best parking.  It can get very crowded on Friday and Saturday nights in this area of DC ranch, so go early.  You can't fault Grimaldis for the poor parking, they are just in a great location.  When the weather cools down, sometimes there is entertainment in the local park area next to Grimaldi's.  You can walk over and enjoy the tunes!    Overall I highly recommend this place, great food, great service and good fun.  When your older Italian friends from back east enjoys it, it is worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my third time here and Grimaldi's has to be the best thin crust pizza I've ever had.  And I've earn A LOT of pizza.  The sauce is just the right blend of tasty but not too overpowering. The crust is crunchy and done just right - brown but not burnt. The toppings all complement each other (I tried pepperoni, Italian sausage and black olives tonight). The service is very good. Prices are reasonable for Vegas. And I like the \"outdoor\" seating in the mall. Or you can sit indoors. I might try another pizza place in Vegas. Or I might not bother.  It's that good here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I will never attend to this location again. There were flies all over the restaurant and food. It was uncomfortable to enjoy food without flies landing on it. Was disgusting! Management said there was nothing they can do about the fly situation. He blamed it on the weather. Poor management  will keep me and my friends and family from attending this establishment."}
{"text":"Came here twice during our getaway week in Scottsdale, both for dinner.    Pros:  Easy to find location in the Scottsdale quarter area.   Solid wait staff, menu is easy with typical pizza (thin crust) and salad items.  Prices are reasonable but wish they offered more items.  Cons:  No ranch dressing for your pizza, pizza was undercooked in the middle one time, and crust was too crunchy for my taste.  I love a good pizza but for what you pay, felt it was not worth the price.  I fluctuate between 3- 3.5 stars for this place, just a touch above average."}
{"text":"Decent service, great food but these guys are super busy and the food can take a long time to get to you. That being said, it's really worther the wait  and the atmosphere is very classy."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Only gripe was service slow and our waiter was a dumbass for lack of a better word. They really have no appetizers either. So be ready to eat lots of pizza."}
{"text":"Grilled chicken on white garlic pizza is amazing. I've always loved Grimaldi's, they have a lot of good toppings to choose from. Good service and decent prices."}
{"text":"My man and I went to the one in New Paltz, NY and were blown away...so we were a bit hesitant to come to the one in Vegas (how could it live up to NY pizza?). Well it was darn close. This Grimaldi's has a really cool patio with half the bar on the inside and half the bar on the outside. We opted to sit on the outside portion and we were greeted by Anthony...one of the sassiest (can you say that about a dude?), coolest, funniest bartenders I have ever met. He totally made fun of me for trying to order ranch for my pizza (yeah, yeah i'm one of those weirdos). My bf got a good laugh out of that and I admitted defeat....I would just have to enjoy the pizza on its own.   Good thing I did because it was delicious. The large pie with extra cheese, pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms was delightful. Be prepared not to have any leftovers because its so good. I could only finish 2 pieces...down from my usual 4. Trust me when I say this is as close as its going to get for NY pizza in Vegas (my man would agree and he's a TOTAL pizza snob). Thank you Anthony...you rock and we will be back to shoot the breeze again soon :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant we've been to since we moved to Vegas! We were greeted instantly at the door by a friendly hostess. This was our first time here and our waitress explained every thing to us about all their options. We ordered the antipasto salad and The Don pizza! Amazing! They both tasted incredible! We highly recommend this Restaurant! We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's did a great job with this space. Very nice inside and out. Looking forward to more lunches here! My group of 5 ordered caprese, a large pizza and large calzone. We were all totally stuffed! Couldn't resist the toffee cheesecake though - I think it might be my new favorite dessert. Ever."}
{"text":"Pizza doesn't get any better than Grimaldi's. Excellent service by a young lady waitress. Consistent food and service at all their Las Vegas area locations."}
{"text":"My wife and I went an hour before closing on a Sunday night and were met by a server that was enthusiastic and welcoming. We ordered \"The Don\" their traditional pizza topped with Italian sausage, meatballs and pepperoni. Our drinks arrived almost immediately and our caesar salad came soon after. Before we finished the salad we were served a straight out of the brick-oven. The pizza was delicious, the service was consistently friendly and helpful. I thought Grimaldi's was a great choice for dinner. Cool looking restaurant too."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Came in today for lunch with coworkers, and the service was impeccable. Not one but two hostesses opened the doors for us when we came in. We got a nice spot on the sunny patio and enjoyed delicious thin-crust pizza. Our waitress took a little bit of time getting to our table at first, but another waiter checked in on us to let us know she would be with us. Very nice. I felt valued by every employee we encountered, which is not something you get to experience very often (unfortunately)!  Personal pizza is pretty big (if you're a big eater, you could probably finish it but I only ate half.)  Base price starts at I think $9 and toppings are an extra $2 to $4 dollars ish depending on what you get. My total with tip was like $19, which for lunch is a bit steep. For me it's worth it because I still have leftovers!"}
{"text":"By far consistently the best pizza in Vegas and as good as the New York original. Dinner is best if you like crispy and chewy crust. Lunch is often thicker and softer but still delicious. Always good service and the occasional and very rare problem is always taken care of. After 5 or more years of eating here, this really is a great place and proves that you can get real pizza in the west. Avoid excessive toppings which can overwhelm the wonderful crust, keep it simple. Highly recommended.  One update. Recently (late 2015) a few of the pizzas have had skimpy toppings and very little cheese. I checked with the staff and they have not officially changed anything so it looks like one of the chefs is cutting back for some reason. We now check with the server that we are getting why we expect."}
{"text":"Not up to the standard of other Grimaldi's. Tasty but very thin and crispy like a cracker rather than bubbly and chewy, with dried rather than moist toppings that seemed petrified or reheated (and it wasn't) rather than fresh. Someone here needs to be reminded about the recipe I think. Will drive to other locations in future."}
{"text":"Grimaldi makes pretty good pizza and thought consistent anywhere.  Came here for dinner one night and pizza was good but felt like we were rushed. This place was noisy. Hard to carry a conversation. Server kept coming up to offer to clean up or box up every time we pause eating to talk.   I knew this prior to my visit here but their drink selections pretty limited.  If I want their pizza, I would take it to go and enjoy at home"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is always a great pizza with a simple menu, great happy hour, and awesome quality.  This location tends to be less crowded than the one in Gilbert and the service is also better with much easier parking.  The restaurant is also kid friendly with smaller sizes available and they give them dough to play with before the meal.  I have also been really impressed by the salads as well that are big enough for all to share.  Prices are very reasonable and they have a good selection of beer and wine."}
{"text":"Just found out about Grimaldi's and have to say WOW!  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Our server Lacy was just adorable and very attentive!!! Jeff, the new manager, was awesome!  He came over to our table to introduce himself which we thought was very nice! We will definitely return as soon as possible.  PS.  Did I mention how good the salads and pizza were?  Absolutely to die for!"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try the coveted Grimaldi's pizza  (on my birthday, of all days) for lunch. It's conveniently located near my favorite coffee shop so why not I said?  The first thing you'll notice is how neat it looks inside. Wine bottle chandeliers, and various accouterments adorning the walls. They have a rather odd business model. The base pizza includes dough and sauce. Yes that's right...cheese is a topping. Rather silly way to justify charging more money to your customers. I would have preferred to pay the same amount with the cheese built into the base price of the pizza-- at least I wouldn't have felt my intelligence was being insulted. Although I suppose it's possible that there might be some lactose intolerant customers who take advantage of this opportunity not to have cheese on their pizza...  Anyway you'll also find that the price starts to rack up rather quickly as you begin adding toppings to your creation, which you'll simply have to do at a place like this. We chose mushrooms, meatballs, and pepperoni. The quality of the ingredients is apparent. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful and definitely not frozen crap that came out of a factory. The tomatoes of the sauce are allegedly organic and I did find the sauce to be full flavored. The mushrooms are also a tasty, chewy delight. The cheese takes some getting used to. Ricotta as a pizza cheese is definitely an unusual choice but I did enjoy the meal over all. The lack of grease is a plus. I also really liked the way you can watch them put it all together. The pepperoni had a kick to it and seemed to be something you might find at a nice Italian deli rather than a Pizza hut.  The originality of this place, combined with the quality of ingredients, will certainly merit a return from me, but it falls short of a five star experience."}
{"text":"Loved it.   Dinner for my date and I was delicious large pizza with pesto, mozz cheese, generous amounts of sausage and meatball. Their large is plenty for two people. It was four average sized slices for each of us. VERY FLAVORFUL!   For a nice dine-in restaurant inside the Pallazo, our dinner only totalled to $23 with tax. Amazing food, service and location. I will probably come back every time I visit Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"I received a. Email for a free one topping pizza and went in to redeem it!  Wow, it wasn't a small pizza at all it was their 18\" pizza!  We ordered Sausage and pepperoni and it was delicious!  I have to admit their sausage was above and beyond any other place I've had sausage on a pizza!  Thank you for the free birthday pizza and I'll definitely continue being a patron of your establishment"}
{"text":"Very good pizza!  Unfortunately, expect to pay $2-5 for each additional topping you pick.  We did a simple pepperoni and then a \"supreme\" type pizza.  I have to say, I'm usually one for lots of toppings, but in this case I'd say less is more(in your wallet too).  The \"supreme\" toppings overshadowed everything--the crust, the sauce, the cheese.  I'll be back to try more of their tasty offerings!"}
{"text":"Came here for my dads birthday because WE LOVE their pizza. It's fresh and SO delicious! I recommend getting basil on the pizza. Maggie was our waitress and WOW she was smiling, happy and gave us WONDERFUL service! She made sure we got everything we needed and the pizza didn't disappoint. I would give 5 stars but the garden salad was a waste of $11! It says it has onions tomatoes and green olives.... Where?!? We received 3 olives and barely any onions or tomatoes. I paid $11 for lettuce with dressing. That's a rip off!"}
{"text":"Best food in town!!  The pepperoni with fresh basil is to die for! I've been craving this pizza for months and I'm finally moving close to this location and can't wait to eat here all the time! I love the ambience it's rustic and romantic I've never had any bad service or bad food. This is by far the best pizza in town so far.  Try it, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I should of went to their original location while I was in NYC because their pizza here was bomb!! Great for my cheat meals :) I'm a very happy customer :)"}
{"text":"\"Our special ingredient is: water.\"   hahahahahah. I don't know why I thought that was so funny... maybe leftover alcohol in my body...who knows.  I did enjoy the pizza! We got a regular one with mushrooms, sweet red peppers, and sausage. It was pretty good! I think this was the first time I had thin-crust NY-style - such a difference from Chicago-style deep dish. I like thin-crust because you don't feel so heavy afterwards, but you also don't really get full.  We also ordered the white pizza, which is just cheese and garlic. I thought this was such a waste of a pizza...but it was actually REALLY good. For all of  you garlic-lovers, definitely try it! I wouldn't suggest any toppings since it takes away from the cheese and garlic flavor.   Our server was great.  This place is pretty big so I don't think you should have problems getting seated.  One word of advice for you NY-style pizza noobs, don't ask for ranch!"}
{"text":"So yummy! 5 stars alone for taste of the tomato, spinach, and ricotta pizza. Hands down delicious! Also had a bite of the regular pepperoni with mushroom and sausage, which was delicious too. The bacon topping was a bit too salty for my taste, but a lot of my friends seemed to enjoy that too. If you like thin crust, NY style pizza, this place delivers.  However, minus two stars for the service. The server didn't do much in terms of taking our order. We were left alone for a while, so one of my girlfriends took initiative and just started writing down our orders with pen and paper. We literally just handed the server our pre-written orders. Lame. Second, when it was time for clean up, the server was trying to dump half eaten pizza crusts on a bigger plate. Large pieces of crusts started falling off his precariously balanced plates right in front of me, but he didn't stop or say sorry. He simply picked up the dropped crusts and started dumping more on top of his growing pile. Eventually, large pieces of half-eaten crusts were falling ON MY LAP. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?! It wasn't until I said, \"Can you please stop that now?\" that he did. No apologies. Just left.  As someone who grew up working in a restaurant, this was 1) disgusting and 2) rude.  Yes, sometimes you drop things when clearing the tables. Yes, sometimes accidents happen. But you always give a courtesy \"sorry\" to the customer if you're dropping shit everywhere, and you STOP if your hands are getting too full. Come back a second time so you don't drop food ON TOP OF THE CUSTOMER.   I'd even cut them some slack it was super busy and the servers were running around, but there were no more than 5-6 tables at the time being served. Awful. I wish I could have given this place 5 stars because we really did enjoy the pizza. The service though? 1 star."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I am so glad I checked on yelp before coming in.  Just a note,  it is quite expensive since menu contains basic cheese pizza and you need to add toppings one by one and each time it is a couple of dollars or even more. Ordered caprese salad, was not good, tomatoes didn't taste like tomatoes. But again, pizza is the king. It was awesome. Note: subscribe to their fan club get $5 off the bill."}
{"text":"The pizza is always great. I order mine a little crispy and I think its better that way. I really like the pepperoni or sausage. Also, I do plain cheese sometimes but add ricotta cheese which is really good. The service in DC Ranch can be a bit iffy from time to time especially if they are busy. It's not cheap either but otherwise it's a great place for pizza."}
{"text":"Yay!! I finally got to try this place after seeing the original place in New York on all the travel and foodie shows!! I was excited to find out that there was a location on the west coast!!  Pizza here is a bit more pricey, but it is yummy. A personal 12 inch pizza is $9 and toppings are $2 each... and it doesn't matter what size you get! So for a small pizza, you don't get as much value with toppings. I had a personal with pepperoni and mushrooms which is $13 and $14 with tax. Not bad and it satisfied me.   Pizza is thin crust and oven baked. Very light and tasty. Since the pizza is thin, a personal will fill up a hungry person, if you are not too hungry, then it might be good for 2 people. I had left overs and ate it the next morning in my room and it still tasted good!!  The only thing I didn't like was that you can't charge to your room!! I was staying at the Venetian and I wanted my points!! Also, this is located on the Palazzo side of the shopping upstairs, like the end on the Palazzo side, so if you are staying at the Venetian, or like me in the Venezia tower, it can be a bit of a walk!"}
{"text":"I know I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, but that's exactly how I feel. I have been to Grimaldi's twice: at my last two birthdays to use their free pizza coupon. Although I appreciate the \"freeness\" of the pie, I'm going to have to pass in the future. Why? The pizza here is just not very good.  I should have known when the waitress offered garlic and oregano with the pie. If I wanted to season it myself, I would have made it at home. Seriously, this sauce is just pureed tomatoes. I think they try to make up for it with Buffalo mozzarella, but the bulk of any pizza is the crust and sauce. Although the former is tasty, the latter is a waste of tomatoes.   Thankfully, I didn't pay for it, because a large pizza goes for nearly $20 here. My suggestion is to head to a local Barro's and get something much less expensive and better. The benefit here is that the service was pretty good, but if you're looking for pizza, walk on by."}
{"text":"This was an awesome pizza named the Brooklyn Bridge. We also had a s salad for 2. Good place ."}
{"text":"I planned a girls night out and created an event on Facebook, only about 9 people said they were coming so I made a reservation for 15 just in case. So I found out when we got there about 25 people were going to show up, I let the waitress know who in turn told her \"manager\", she came to me and told me she couldn't accommodate more people because they were just too packed. This stressed me out because I planed the event so I just told people that we should leave and go to Buca Di Bepo where they are ok with a big party. When more of my guests arrived, another manager named Mike came and saw my friends sharing a chair took the initiative to get us another table which made me feel a lot better. We had a really good time and the food was so good! My suggestion is if you're going to have a big party, don't come here because it's way too small of a place and Park West has the worse parking lot. This place is better for a smaller party. Oh and when I made the reservation they said I had to have a $200 minimum and could only have the table for 2 hours, that really didn't make much sense to me. Anyway, I wouldn't come back as often, the women manager put a bad taste in my mouth, you would think that my guests money is just as any other person waiting for a table"}
{"text":"I'm from Buffalo, NY and am in town visiting friends. We went to Grimaldi's for a late lunch one day and I was very impressed!  There are plenty of choices for toppings and you can choose some of the specialty pizzas as well. There are also some appetizers and desserts.  We started with a Caesar salad which was fantastic. It was flavorful and they even grated fresh pepper on top for you.  The pizza is made in a brick oven and you can see them put them in and take them out - the oven can hold quite a few pizzas! The time to receive the pizza was very reasonable and it was delicious! We opted to get half with just pepperoni and then the other half with jalapeños and bacon (not my choice lol) but it was still fantastic! We weren't able to finish the entire pizza so we ended up taking a few slices home for leftovers.  We ended the meal with a cannoli which was also amazing. The shell was crunchy and the filling was rich and creamy. I highly recommend the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but we found a stink bug in the salad.  It would have been better to find the bug before starting to eat the salad but it was found at the end.  The manager generously took the salad off the bill.  Gee thanks manager for the free salad we appreciate it.  Waiter was great, pizza is great, management needs to work on customer service. Unfortunately I will not be back thanks for the bug."}
{"text":"I love pizza and this place makes the cut. I am very picky about my pizza and this place is delicious. Lots of options and tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"I go here about once a month.  The food is always consistent and the service is also.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Bomb spot. Great pizza. Bring from NE it's been a good find for me. Yummy pizza is Devine"}
{"text":"I like Grimaldi's but just don't think of going here very often.  I was in the area with a friend this last Saturday and we stopped in for dinner.  They were very busy but we were seated with just a five minute wait.  We split a Caesar salad and a pizza.  Both were good and we added Italian sausage and ricotta to the pizza which was a good combination. The pizzas here are large and we couldn't even finish what they call a small size.  Overall it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"I've been to the Grimaldi's in DC Ranch and the one in Old Town.  This new location is very good as well.  In my opinion, the best seat is at the bar facing outside.  The view of the McDowell Mountains from that spot is great.  We chose a pizza with ground beef, mushrooms and onions.  It came out perfect.  Thin crust so you don't get too full.  The large size was enough so that we had a few pieces for leftovers.  Washed down with a couple of Blue Moons, it was a nice dinner."}
{"text":"I was in town for the UCLA game and stayed with a buddy at his place in Henderson.  He loves this place and recommended we try it.  Located in a strip mall with a few other eateries, parking was actually pretty easy on a busy Friday night.  We tried to get a patio seat since the inside can get pretty noisy but we ended up right in the middle of the dining room.  Fortunately, the acoustic gods were with us and we were not surrounded by screaming kids.  Great service from the start.  They had a ton of employees running around filling drinks and clearing plates.  You get a choice of sauces....red, pesto and garlic oil, and a ton of traditional toppings.  I had a feeling the meatball would would be killer and I was correct.  I really top quality thin crust NY pie.  Great flavor, texture and a good bite to the crust.  Ready to get your mind blown?  They use slices of cheese instead of shredded....and they put the sauce on top of the toppings...  Boom!  OK...not too revolutionary but the results were good.  A very respectable dinner salad and a decent value.  Top notch for a pizza joint."}
{"text":"Amazing Food, A small pizza definitely fed 2 people, waitress never refilled my water, which made me sad, but overall great time."}
{"text":"Went in w my birthday email for free pizza. Waiter was great.  Just had iced tea & soda.  Pizza was delicious as usual Left tip as if bill had $16 pizza incl Dont want to short-change staff"}
{"text":"Great service. Unbelievable pizza. And cheesecake that will blow your mind. Plus a great wine list."}
{"text":"Wait, is this a joke? I feel like I'm five years old again with my menu on the placemat. How come I don't get the free box of crayons?   Wait, there are only like three things to choose from? Pizza, Calzone, Salad. Seriously?   Wait, how come there's no sauce on my pizza and the crust is so thin there are holes in it? Why does the chicken taste like rubber?  Went here on new years eve and the atmosphere was like a freakin' funeral home. Lots of stuck up scottsdale people drinking Robert Mondavi wine and acting very proper.   Next time I want pizza I'll be at Domino's."}
{"text":"Food service  and the cleanliness was over the top the waitress was alittle unsure of her menu. .ahhh well the manage was rounding and checking on everyone"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza in the world. Don't be an idiot... Get the peperoni and sausage pizza. Add onions if you like."}
{"text":"It wasn't my favorite pizza, but I think that's more indicative of my taste than the quality. For instance, the pepperoni was fresh and had a good taste - I just prefer thinner slices that are more crispy. The sauce was good and slightly sweet. Probably the best part was the crust - crispy on the bottom, but chewy on the inside and had a nice flavor.  As for the atmosphere, everything was very clean... I haven't seen such clean drink glasses in a long time. The utensils and cloth were also very good.  Service was adequate - the waiters were aware of their tables, providing refills as needed and checking in at a reasonable rate. Drinks were brought out quickly. When there were seats available we were seated quickly."}
{"text":"This location is always managed terribly. They consistently keep half the restaurant empty on busy weekend evenings with a wait time of 30-45 minutes to be seated. The hostesses always seem overwhelmed and they seem in no rush to clear empty tables and seat people, even though they are losing countless diners who don't want to wait so long for a table. They also use the \"NoWait\" app however they don't know how it works and if you check in on the app, they get confused and give away your table. Don't get me wrong, Grimaldi's in general are fantastic restaurants and the food is amazing, but save yourself the hassle and go to the DC Ranch location, it's much better run."}
{"text":"Brick oven pizza is lighter and the mozzarella is sort of cut up and in clusters of cheese throughout. If summer had a pizza it would be brick oven pizza. If you ask me it's hit or miss. Grimaldi's is a bull's-eye they got it right. Thanks to the yelp reviewer who had recommended extra sauce. That really made the difference. The pizza is chewy in the right spots, crispy in the others. The ingredients are fresh. The sauce is seasoned to perfection and the cheese is supah-fresh!  I ordered take out and I will be back it's got a cool ambiance. Oh, and DO NOT SLEEP ON THE CANNOLLI!"}
{"text":"Shared a  bbq chicken pizza (was delicious) and pepperoni,mushroom and ricotta pizza.. food was great. Service was ok..server came over with a lame excuse why our Pizza was taking so long.. saw table arrive 30 minutes after we placed  order.. And ate then  left before  we even got our food.. all i have to say is we saw 2 managers.. plain and simple MANAGERS at this establishment have horrible customer service skills.. I understand place was busy on a Friday night  But if you hate your job that much quit   But I will a say our server came over with complimentary Tiramisu  (just delightful) .."}
{"text":"I was hungry on a Sunday afternoon, and I was visiting from California. Let me start off this review by saying that this place has the potential to be a 5 star, but I only downgraded because it is a very tiny place that is very popular, which results in some waiting for a table/spot at the bar, and your pizza.   However, this place is the BOMB.com for several reasons. First, it has a great atmosphere. All the waiters are friendly and attentive, even if you aren't sitting at a table! The bartender Kevin kicks ass. Great sense of humor, and excellent bartender all-around. The pizza is amazing! I had a simple Personal Pepperoni Pizza with Extra Famous Grimaldi's Sauce. Absolutely delicious!   As far as the price goes, I ordered a small caesar salad, a lemonade, and a personal pizza with two toppings and the price came to about $24. This is misleading, because I ate all the food myself, but it could have easily fed 2-3 people.   So in summary, great food, great employees, great price. Check it out, but try and go when its not as busy."}
{"text":"Love this pizza- consistently good and you can't beat the pepperoni. Our favorite is the white garlic pizza with pepperoni. the cheesecakes are awesome too. Free pizza on your birthday if you sign up on their website. One negative experience with a waitress, but other than that we've never had a bad experience here. It can get crowded during busy times and it is a bit loud, but this is a pizza place."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience . My friend and I had different thins and both felt ill later. Pizza was really terrible . Do not go"}
{"text":"Generally we are big Grimaldi's fans; however, yesterday was a turning point due to what we believe is poor management.  We received the \"Tax Day\" 1040 special via email  offering a $10.40  pizza yesterday only. What a terrific deal for one one our favorite pizza spots. The offer stated dine in or carry out. Knowing it might  be a busy night with that offer, I called the Pima Road location at 4:45 to place an order and was advised that my plain cheese  pizza on the special would not be available until 7:30pm!  2.5 hour wait due to so many \"pre-orders\" for the special ! This ended that conversation and  we phoned LAMP and enjoyed one of their terrific pizzas instead.   Something seems out of line with being told it was a 2.5 hour wait for that one pizza type ordered  by phone . Wondering if the dining room also had a 2.5 hour wait last night....  Disappointing experience ....."}
{"text":"I loved everything here. The atmosphere, the service everything. The pizza reminded me of home. Having never been to Italy...  There are 2 pizza places back home in Cincinnati Ohio, that Grimaldi's reminds me of. Larosa's and Dinado's pizza. I've never had anything close to eather one of there pizza before, and they nailed both of them in one."}
{"text":"The pesto, white garlic, and margarita were amazing!  And the kids loved them too!  Would go here again! And cold stone is right next door so got dessert too!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly. Great service. Order Caprese salad and two pizzas. Food delicioso. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Yummy crust, sauce, and fresh mozzarella cheese. Not a fan of their pepperoni though. One waitress is super annoying but most are great."}
{"text":"3 for the service, 4 for the food!   Dined in on a Wednesday afternoon it was pretty slow so our food came pretty fast. Ordered the personal 12\" with pepperoni ricotta cheese and pesto. It was amazing. Came to a total of 17.30, pricey but I guess it was worth it.  3 for the service because they overcharged me and when I called to see about them correcting it I was told It wasn't possible and he would gladly give me a couple bucks if I came back to the restaurant wtf??? I wouldn't have been in this situation if it wasn't for THEIR mistake and now I have to drive back to collect my money. Didn't sit well with me, I have been to a couple places that made the same mistake and fixed it on the spot so it sounds sketchy to me.  One of my favorite places so I was very disappointed with how they handled that situation."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because I have been detoxing or if the pizza really was so delish! Thin crust, perfect amount of sauce and melts in your mouth!!! The ham was my least favorite topping but the pepperoni was yummy...  Caesar salad was ok!   Great wine and beer selection. Service was wonderful from the hostess to the server & bartender!!!"}
{"text":"Not only was the pizza spot on NY! It was the best dinner we had with service that was refreshing and professional.  Even though we walked in 30 min before closing they welcomed us with open arms. Took our order and NEVER rushed us out. We were even greeted by the manager and asked how things were. We felt very appreciated and the food is always great at any Grimaldi's restaurant. The greek salad was very yummy! Of course the crust is the best ever with the coal brick oven."}
{"text":"No, this wasn't my choice for pizza. Underwhelming as usual. Only great thing was Tuesdays are 1/2 off bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is amazing!! I went with a group of 13 and we were seated very quickly. I ordered the house salad and sheared a pizza with a few coworkers and couldn't have been happier. The pizza is fantastic, it's thin and crispy on the bottom, and deliciously cheesy on the top. Our service was great and everyone left with nothing but great things to say."}
{"text":"I went here last night with some friends. The service we got was great, she refilled our drinks several times and even split the check for us after we forgot to tell her to. My pizza was fantastic, I got a personal pizza with artichokes and sliced tomatoes. It's a little more expensive than I would normally pay for pizza, but the ingredients were high quality and I was really pleased with it.  Everyone else at the table had great reviews for what they ate. I didn't see any pizza left on the table at the end of the night. Worth repeating, just wish they had a bigger menu, it's pizza or nothing."}
{"text":"My husband said that this is not only the best pizza place in Vegas but probably the best he's ever had. That could be the hunger talking or the fact that he just really appreciates a good pie, but I will agree this place was pretty good.  It's a bit out of the way at the end of the Grand Canal shops in the Palazzo but it makes it a quieter place to chill out after walking the shops. When we went around 1 it was not busy at all. My husband got a cheese pizza with bacon and I got the 4 cheese pizza. The combination of the cheeses was so incredibly delicious that my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Even my husband's pizza tasted good and I'm not a big fan of red sauce (which it had a lot of). We would definitely come back here (the pesto pizza was calling my name as well), but next time we'd share a pizza or order smaller sizes because we got carried away and barely had room for dinner."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Pizza is good.  Long long long wait to get seated. Will factor that in before my next visit, if there is one."}
{"text":"I went with a larger group to Grimaldi's.  We sat on the patio and had a fabulous meal - a lot of fun.  We were on a schedule but were able to move on to the next activity thanks to the great service!  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very awesome pizza..classic New York style atmosphere and their pizzas are delicious! Best advice: if you get pepperoni, ask them to sauté it first, makes it extra crispy"}
{"text":"I work at a near by restaurant ... we were craving something different because we eat our food everyday.  So we ordered takeout.  I am not a big pizza fan but it was hot tasty and ready when they said it would be."}
{"text":"Can't make a leveled judgement. I called to inquire about gluten free pizza. The response I got was \" well kinda sorta gluten free but not really\" very reassuring as someone who cannot have gluten. The women who answered wasn't the nicest or knowledgable about GF. we walked over and put our names in and hostess said she would text us in 20 -25 minutes. We waited 40 and finally asked they said they had texted us and called our names but we never showed. We never got the text but we were seated right away. Our waitress was fabulous she was very friendly and quick service. My husband and I shared a Cesar salad. He got a regular pizza and i got a gluten free one. My gluten free pizza was dropped before it came out and bot our pizzas were comped which was so nice of Grimaldi's. The hostess' were rude and unhelpful but once seated service was great."}
{"text":"I cannot say how disappointed I am with this pizza place. I've read and heard so many good things.   Food quality - 1 star Inside of my pizza box lay a black ring of burnt crust with a smattering of toppings tossed on top. The crust was burnt so much we could not eat it. I know a brick oven crust has some character and some char to the edges, but this was ridiculous. We paid $2 each for four different toppings. For $2 of onions, I counted 13 pieces of onions. $2 for a small handful of jalapeño STEMS. The mushrooms seemed like they came from a can. The sausage was the only tasty topping on our pizza. The cheese was as flavorless as the crust. Maybe if the cheese was burnt, it would have had some flavor.   Food price - 1 star Compared to similar pizza places, excluding the fast food pizza places like Pizza Hut, the prices are a little high. If you only want a couple of toppings, your pizza will be cheap. If you like a lot of toppings, you should bring you last paycheck. My four topping, large pizza, complete with flavorless cheese and a burnt crust came two $25.   Overall, not a great experience. I'm confident in saying I would rather have a slice of pizza from my school's cafeteria. Too much money and way too much disappointment."}
{"text":"It's a little better than A OK but not quite 4 stars, however, since service was good, and I did like my pizza, I'll go for it and give 4! I came here twice. Both times I got the same pizza. White pizza with pesto. I gotta say, it was good. Not my favorite, no, but tasty. It is expensive, however, a large pie divided by 3 girls was 2 large slices each. We shared the spinach salad and a large pie. It was good. There were very little leftovers.  Although close to my home, I dont think I will frequent this place. Kinda on the expensive side for just pizza. It's cool to come with some friends, share and chat for a while."}
{"text":"The pizza is authentic Italian style, but not as good as anything I had in Italy. The crust isn't crispy enough and there aren't enough toppings. More cheese would be nice. It would be great if they offered a choice of whole wheat crust.   Ordering extra toppings is very expensive and they only have a few house pizzas with several toppings. Overall the pizza is too expensive for what you get.   My dining partner, who grew up in Brooklyn, thought the pizza was OK but not as good as NY pizza.  The atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"Pizza pizza and more pizza but not much else. In an area that there are a ton of excellent pizza spots this one is nothing memorable. Cool patio bar with good beer selection though"}
{"text":"So many places try to make the NY pizza claim. I feel like there aren't any that make them out of New York really, but some try really hard. Maybe it's the air and water in NY that cloud our judgement or transform the normal Into something else. This place is as close as it gets for a chain. We can argue all day on the authenticity criteria, but bottom line this is a great pie. Beware, the small and large pizzas are not that different from each other and both are big!"}
{"text":"Great place for pizza lovers! Very fresh ingredients and delicious pizzas. Great options for build your own. Definitely recommend dining in than take out."}
{"text":"simply put!!! we love this place and come here for a pie about twice a month. the caesar salad and the anti pasta are our favorite starters.  the pepperoni is the best along with the sausage, but we always love a good tomato basil pizza."}
{"text":"Even though I've lived in Las Vegas a few years, this is the first time I've eaten at any one of the Grimaldi's spots. I'm sad that I haven't eaten here sooner because the pizza we got was delicious. I don't really care what type of pizza it is or how \"authentic\" it may or may not be. The only thing I really care is how it tastes. And, the pie that we had was mighty good.  We started with a mediocre  small Mediterranean salad ($7). It was large enough for three or four.  The pizza we tried was a small white with garlic ($16) with two toppings (pepperoni and mushrooms, $2 each). The crust was excellent, with a decent amount of it charred, as can be expected from a brick oven place. Even with all the cheese and pepperoni that was on the pizza, the bottom of the crust held up well and wasn't soggy, providing a crisp and crackling texture with every bite.  The small pizza is more like a medium and is large enough for two to share. Their \"personal pizza\" is what others would consider a small.  The most annoying thing about this place is that toppings are the same price no matter what size of pizza you get. Obviously, you're going to get more pepperoni, for example, if you get a large pizza. But, if you get a personal pizza you get less but have to pay the same price. These pies aren't cheap, so when you start adding toppings the price can get ridiculous.  I'm not sure I'll be back to this location, just because finding parking at Boca Park is always a hassle. But I will stop by another Grimaldi's spot to get my pizza fix."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am a big food junkie.  Everywhere my friend Leo and I go we look up the best pizza places in the area.  I just moved to Las Vegas and asked where we should go to get some good pizza  He said he has heard of a place called Grimaldi's and that it has some very good reviews so we decided to go.  We go there around lunchtime and was greeted by a very pleasant staff. Since it was our first time there the manager of the place came out to greet us and recommended a few items on the menu.  We started off with a  Chicken Caesar  Salad which was amazing.  I don't like my Caesar to be too fishy, this one was perfect.  It was a nice fresh start to our meal.  Then we ordered a small calzone with meatballs and pepperoni which by the way is far from small.  It came with this marinara sauce that was so delightful that I wanted to take some home with me so I could dip everything in it.  It was cooked to perfection as was the pizza we ordered.  The pizza was a large with red sauce, pepperoni, sausage and basil.  Let me tell you, after eating there I can easily say Las Vegas' best pizza by a long shot.  The pizza was hand tossed with the freshest ingredients, topped perfectly and was also cooked to perfection.  I don't always judge a pizza by whats on it but by the way the dough is cooked as well.  I usually don't eat the crust but I couldn't help myself here, it was just so good.  So after all that food I had to try the desert.  I figured since everything else was so good the deserts must be the bomb, and they were.  I had the tiramisu and he had the canoli.  I didn't think I had anymore room left but when I tasted that tiramisu I couldn't stop until it was gone.    Between the awesome staff, the great food and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant, I have to say it is the best pizza place I have ever been so far.  If another place wants to take the top spot in my book they are going to have to be something spectacular because this is an amazing place to eat.  I definitely will be bringing out of town guest, family and friends here whenever I get a chance."}
{"text":"I have been eyeing Grimaldi's for a while. Feeling like pizza I was glad that Grimaldi's came to mind. Parking was bit of a chore but it usually is in this parking lot. The wait for our table was a short 5 minutes. The dining area inside is smaller then I expected so I can't even imagine trying to come here on a Friday or Saturday night and not experience a long wait.   We started off with a small \"Antipasto\". It was $9. I really liked the fresh mozzarella and the whole thing in general. It can easily be shared between 2 people. For pizza we decided to go custom. It had ricotta, mozzarella cheese, sausage and meatballs. They only have thin pizza here since it is NY style. The crust was thin but crisp and held the toppings well. I did enjoy the meatball and sausage but I'm not much of a meat eater so, I did end up picking a lot of the toppings off (people in my party wanted the meat and I wanted cheese ahhhh compromise) and next time I would probably go for a personal pizza with just the cheeses. The pizza is cooked using a coal brick oven. Our total was $37 for the antipasto, pizza and 3 sodas. I didn't think that was bad at all!   They have a dining area outside. They offer a banquet room and catering."}
{"text":"I LOVE pizza, so finding this spot on Yelp and by a direct referral I stopped the fam here Sunday afternoon.    Authentic looking pizzeria and well laid out restaurant.    The pizza crust was just the right thick/thinness.  I enjoyed the mozzarella droppings along with the pepperoni!  The service was on point, yet I just didn't LOVE the pizza as I'd hoped.    It's definitely worth trying and I'm not knocking it.  It's just not what I was hoping for.  I guess I'm more of a New York Style Pizza girl."}
{"text":"Went to try because we had a gift card. Took forever to get our food and when it came they gave my husband a pesto pizza and he ordered a calzone.  Was very loud in there. They comped the calzone and apologized profusely.   Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"We always love Grimaldi's. This one is in the mall . We had there seasonal pizza the Quattro Formaggio it has romano, gorgonzola,  parmesan and asiago cheese. Staff is excellent."}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch after smelling the pizza the day before while walking by. It surely did not disappoint. We were greeted and seated promptly. Our waitor was very freindly and we took his suggestion of trying the pepporoni pizza and we also had a house salad, which was huge! The manager came to our table to apologize for the wait and told us the pizza was a little burned on bottom and they were remaking the pizza and he offered us a free desert. Which the cheesecake was delicious. When our pizza arrived it did not disappoint and was delicious. we appreciate that they take pride in making quality food. Definately will be back soon. The following day we were walking by again and they were outside giving samples and it made us want to go in and eat another pie. If you stay at the Palazzo or Venetian make sure to go over and have a delicious pie."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing and wine was delicious. Michael is a master of his craft and deserves more than this review. My birthday was done right. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love grimaldis. For me it is easily the best pizza in Las Vegas and I can't even eat cheap delivery pizza anymore. I love that the dough always comes out nice and crispy. Their pepperoni is my favorite because the pepperonis are small and taste very flavorful like real meat unlike most cheap pepperoni pizzas. I also like to add jalapeño for a bit of a kick. Although that is my favorite I know many other people who love their other toppings (meatballs, sausage, etc) and even their white pizza! I would say getting a Caesar salad with your pizza is a must as it is absolutely the best Caesar dressing I have ever had!  I always dip my crust in it afterwards- so delicious! I always ask for extra dressing I really think it is part of the whole grimaldis experience! The inside is very cute as well (except they need more, larger restrooms)  and always good service."}
{"text":"OMG....last night was a nightmare. We were (not) served by the most incompetent server,who was rivaled in his rudeness and seconded by the manager on duty.  Two drinks ordered were unavailable as there was none of the requested mixer( orange juice and 7up, or Sierra mist) We waited (me without a beverage) for 35 minutes for our pizza (they were not overly busy) at which point we enquired of the manager as to when it might be expected.  He disappeared and returned several mi urea later to inform us that it would take another 25 to 35 minutes. We left!.... avoid this restaurant. Grimaldis in Old Town, Scottsdale is fabulous.  Go there .   Had to give it 1 star, but it actually this particular store deserves zero.  Get a new manager and fire the bald waiter."}
{"text":"After my horrible experience at Nu Sanctuary last night, dining at Grimaldi's was like being treated to a five star restaurant. Service was top notch. Our experience from the time we walked in to the time we left was impeccable.  Our server, Ray, was friendly and asked us if we have been to the restaurant before or if it was our first time. It was our first time so he took the time to explain the menu and how their coal brick oven creates perfectly charred thin crust. We decided to skip appetizers and go straight to pizza.   We ordered a large white pizza with garlic, one half with ricotta and basil and the other half with pesto and grilled chicken.  The crust was so delicious and charred just right. I was surprised that it wasn't greasy at all.   Ray was great about checking on us and refilling drinks at the right times.  He even cleaned the crumbs off our table before our dessert came out. It really did feel like five star service!  He recommended the cheesecake which they bake in house. I am so glad we ordered it. It was creamy and was the right amount of sweetness. It was the perfect way to end the meal.  I love how service was prompt and friendly. It was obvious that their restaurant was like a well oiled machine because even though it was a busy Saturday night, we never waited too long or felt rushed. Great pizza, great service, and close to home... I couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's never disappoints.  Pizza is great and love the calzone also!  I was glad when they brought back the full bar."}
{"text":"Anyone giving less than 4 stars must have simply been there on a bad night, because it doesn't get any better than this!"}
{"text":"Can be hard to find but there's no line. I've been to the one in Brooklyn and it tastes just as good. The service was good and the environment quiet which is exactly what I wanted after walking around the strip all morning. I ordered the Margherita with pepperoni. It was soooo good!"}
{"text":"We love other Grmaldi's locations, but service was mediocre in this location. It was a busy night but when isn't it? Hard to use that as an excuse. Our waiter was condescending and insincere, but pizza was great as usual. Great if you love thin crust pizza! I would stick with the other two locations in Scottsdale where we have seen a better overall experience."}
{"text":"I've give it 4.5 stars if I could. More veggie options like spinach would put it over the top. Had a large pizza with pepperoni sausage tomatoes and red peppers, and a white pizza with sausage meatballs basil garlic and artichoke. Both were great but the white pizza won. Next time I may try their pesto pizza."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant in a mall. Found through yelp. The wine from Italy is outstanding. Pizza and salad are good. Would definitely go again while visiting the mall."}
{"text":"Honestly I think this stuff saved me from a meltdown lol. Vegas during this trip really let me down and it was our last night and I was feeling sick... sneezing and coughing and just totally over it. In fact that morning between being sick and seven days of being in stupid casinos full of smoke I literally couldn't taste anything! The hubby got some sort of mocha concoction at Starbucks and I was like oh what is this a low fat latte? Lol.  So annnnyways, I wasn't in the mood to go anywhere or do anything. The hubby being the best hubby ever, offered to run across the blvd and pick up a pie for us to split. Given the options of insanely over priced room service food which was bound to be awful we figured even bad pizza is decent in the end! So we called in an order for a large \"the don\" and let me tell you it was delish! Topping of pepperonis and meatballs were plentiful! The cheese was googey and perfect. And while the crust was on the thin New York style it was still hitting the spot.  Oh and cuz we couldn't fish it all that night... it made for a delicious breakfast cold the next morning too ;)"}
{"text":"Bar none the best quality pizza I have ever had.  They use the freshest ingredients for the pie and their toppings.every once in a while they over cook the pizza but it is still awesome.  You cannot go back to papa johns or Pizza Hut after trying their pizza."}
{"text":"Came here for a 8 person business lunch for work.  They sat us in the back next to another table that looked like they were business professionals on lunch.  The place was very spacious and well decorated.  Wasn't too busy for a Wednesday afternoon.  We ended up ordering all large versions of the don, the brooklyn and two traditional pizzas.  We also got a caesar, Antipasto, and House salad to start.  No problems with service.  Salads came out in about 10 minutes.  They were small, and each bowl was good for about 4 people.  They were fine, nothing to write home about.  The pizzas started coming out 10 minutes after the salad- but they didn't all come out at the same time, but within a few minutes of each other.  The pizzas were exactly what you come to expect New York style.  Thin and a small layers, not like a Chicago style where its piled on.  They did taste good, and we ended up eating all 4 pizzas and 3 salads!  It was good food, but nothing that blew me away.  I don't know if I would come back on my own in the future. or even with family or friends.  But as a pizza place, if you don't want dominoes or little caesars, this would be a good change of pace."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Vegas I MUST eat here. The white with garlic and pepperoni is the best! Crust is amazing and chewy. I only come to the summerlin location. The one in the mall isn't up to par."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch as a group and it was the birthday girl's pick.  We got a large antipasto, large Caesars salad with chicken, one large pizza with just pepperoni (since they don't have pineapple.  When I asked for pineapple, the server said no, we are an authentic Italian pizza place, there is no such thing as pineapple on the pizza...she could have used more tact on the way she delivered that), and one large white pizza with chicken.  Everything was just average, however, the white pizza with chicken was super bland.   Would not recommend...not worth to ingest on tasteless bad carbs.  I honestly think Papa Johns pizza would be better than that white pizza.  I don't think I will be coming back to Grimaldi's, unless it's the b-day person's pick...cross my fingers that it won't happen again."}
{"text":"Really nicely decorated. Our servers was very helpful, suggesting a different approach to our order. Which was really appreciated and a better idea.  The pizza was a little crusty with a little more oil than I'm use to. It was still really good, and they had a good selection of stand alones and mixed large pizzas. On that note, a large pizza is ideal for 3-4 people. Makes for about two slices a person. Combined with drinks it a fair split."}
{"text":"Update to my previous food. Great food! And, this time great service. Granted, I did not come during dinner rush. We were seated immediately and our orders taken soon after. As I had two young children with me, the server brought small lumps of dough for them to work on, which kept them delightfully occupied. The service was good and timely. It was a little slow and getting the bill and the payment, but otherwise excellent!!"}
{"text":"We love the pizza at Grimaldis and usually make a point of going to the north Scottsdale location whenever we are in the area.   The crust is thin (we don't like thick crust) and pliable enough to easily fold it (if you eat yours like that!) with a nice chew on the edge.   The coal fired oven adds some smokiness and a little char that gives it character.   The cheese  is fresh and the sauce has nice flavor with a little sweetness.   Even with extra cheese, Grimaldi's pizza seems lighter than some other pizzas I've had which makes it easier to eat 3 or 4 pieces!   We've also had the house salad which is ok.  Even the small size is quite large.   It's mostly lettuce but it's reasonably priced so it's a nice way to get some vegetables and remove some of the guilt from eating all that pizza!"}
{"text":"BEST pizza in Nevada!  Thin crust & excellent sauce.  Great Salad to go with your pizza-"}
{"text":"This was a perfect in-room dining pizza option! I ordered everything with their easy online menu and it was ready for me to pick up at the time specified! Just a few minute walk from our room at the Venetian, it was easy to pick up. I will keep this in mind for the future. The pizzas are good size and the pieces are large, only four stars because of how thin they were. Some may prefer this though!"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty plain Jane when it comes to food so stuck with the basic Pep Pizza. However, my parents had a fully-loaded pizza and gotta say, this place is awesome! Loved the thinness of their pizza allowing enough room for a second, maybe a third slice!   Service was A+. Cleanness was A+! The ONLY thing I thought was a bit ridiculous was the $2 charge for each additional topping. Definitely not cheap pizza, but worth the price."}
{"text":"Had a craving for great cheesecake and they have great NY classic cheesecake. Last visit pizza was not up to par, this time it was great so we are glad we went back.  Only complaint was the espresso...it's very good but ..if was ridicously small, 3 sips and it's gone.  I get espresso in many cafes and this was a rip off.  When I asked the girl if they could at least fill the cup..which by the way was the smallest espresso cup we've ever seen, she replied \"well did you order one shot or two?\" I said one, but I should've said this isn't even one.  Matching her sarcasm.  So be prepared.   They don't serve regular coffee so it's that or cafe americana, which my g.uest said was ok.  Last visit regular cheese pizza was all dough very little cheese.  Told waitress and her reply was, we'll do you want to.order extra cheese?  Mybreply, not extra just enough to at least cover the pizza.  So then she recommended we order the maguire pizza.  I don't think she understood.  We've has their cheese pizza before and it was good but sometimes they skimp.  This time it was good but I hate when I have to police our order each time."}
{"text":"Went last night with friends. We sat outside on the patio because the weather was so beautiful. They do not have any happy hour specials. The wine and beer are very reasonably priced, so that helped! Each couple ordered a large pizza, us pesto, grilled bell peppers, sun dried tomatoes,  mushroom. Them, red sauce with sausage, tomatoes and onion. Both were delish and arrived hot. Service was great...almost coming by too often! They kept refilling the soda glass, which was nice. They have a crispy thin crust pizza but it is very pricey for pizza...basic pizza is $16-18 and toppings are $2 or $4 each so our pizzas were about $30 each! Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time at this location..they are so nice and friendly.  Food was great.  Best cheesecake ever!! That says a lot considering the cheesecake factory is a few doors down...no comparison!  The NY classic cheesecake is out if this world and I hate cheesecake...lol"}
{"text":"I love this pizza place.  Maybe it's my North east roots, but to me this is how pizza is supposed to taste.  This place is based off the famous spot in DUMBO NYC and it does it justice.  While I can't say that it's good as it's famous sister, I can say that it's pretty darn good especially for all the pizza imitators out here.  Mmm spicy pepperoni, chicken sausage, and onion.  Maybe it means I'm getting old but give me a night with my girl, a large one of these pizzas, a bottle of wine, and a tiramisu.  The calzones are a little ehhh.  Maybe I'm just spoiled from the juicy ones back east.  The values aren't the greatest, it being a chain and all but I love the place and I frequent this joint all the time.  Extra super bonus points for having such coureous staff.  Love you Grimaldis!"}
{"text":"Waited for over an hour for a table of two. No places to sit while we waited. Small bar and no places to sit and have a beer while we waited. Many open tables and never got seated so we left. Limited menu items. They charge $2 for toppings."}
{"text":"As usual the pizza with kalamata olives and basil is consistently good each time we order it."}
{"text":"AWESOME!   had the Don's pizza, it was great, cheesecake was also delicious, the best wait staff I have ever had at a restaurant and so friendly, manager Vince came over and super friendly and talked and talked to us,  can't say enough good about this place, will definitely go here again"}
{"text":"Eh, it was ok. We ordered pizza to go from here and it was cold and sort of disappointing. Will definitely pass on this place."}
{"text":"This is normally one of my favorite pizza places. However, for some reason at this location 2 out of the 3 times we've been here they've been stoking the ovens so pizzas aren't available for an hour. Of course they don't tell you that until you're seated, have the baby in the high-chair with all their stuff on the table. I've never had this issue at the Scottsdale Quarter location. Why the hell would you shut down your ability to make pizzas right at dinner time??"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great service. The pizza is the best in all of Arizona. Great taste, not over salted or greasy. Very clean restaurant. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza and a Caesar Salad with chicken \"to go\" tonight, and I'm giving a generous update with three stars... It's been a year and a half since my last review, and I have to say, Grimaldi's - I'm not as much a fan as I was back then.  The pizza was half cooked and only tasted decent when we put it in the oven for another 10 minutes and covered it with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.  The chicken in the Caesar Salad that was supposed to be grilled was not - it looked like completely processed meat that was served luke warm; it was so gross looking that I didn't even taste it.    I'll stick with the original review in saying that Grimaldi's (especially the Old Town location) is a decent place to go if you've got a large group... but it's nothing so special with a smaller group or for take-out.  I won't be rushing back!"}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of enjoying the dining experiences Scottsdale has to offer and I have to say that Grimaldi's has not let me down. Time after time the management exceeds my expectations. The staff is amazing and consistent, the food is superb. Grimaldi's continues to be a favorite and my dining choice for friends and family visiting!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.  Excellent sauce and crust.  Sausage was fresh and flavorful.  We shared a large salad (large feeds 4, small feeds 2), and a 16\" small pizza (thin crust, but it is NOT small) for two adults and two preteen boys.  We had leftovers, but admittedly we didn't go in particularly hungry (late lunch).  Order wisely and this place is reasonably priced for the area.  Service was impeccable too.  There's an area with a TV is you're looking to catch MNF or similar."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's will always be one of my favorite pizza spots. I use to work at the same casino and would always recommend guests to dine at Grimaldi's over any other pizza spot in Vegas. Me and my boyfriend have many good memories at this place. We have our usual pizza and always ask for one side pesto sauce (for me) and one side of their house tomato sauce (for him). I love Grimaldi's and appreciate their free pizza offered to you for your birthday. Hope to dine here again soon !"}
{"text":"The calzone pizza offered in this place was not really a pizza, but cottage cheese pie. That would be okay, if we ordered one, but we asked for pizza. Some details: 1. The dough was for pie, not for pizza. 2. The mozzarella was so old, it turned to a sort of cottage cheese. 3. We asked for pesto in our calzone, but we got just chopped Basel instead. Do they think we don't know what pesto is?! The service is fine and they open until midnight, which is a plus."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch today! We had 2 different personal pizzas, 2 small salads and it was plenty for 4 people. The spinach salad was great as was the Ceaser salad. We also tried the lemon martini which was so yummy! Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but good things to say.  I bring clients and vendors here a lot.  The prices are good, the table wine is cheap and goes with most the pizza amazingly.  The pizza and food is without a doubt, the best in town against it competition.  The service is always good and the location is great.  I have even charged my phone or plugged in my laptop on the lighted tree on many occasions..."}
{"text":"4 stars for good brick oven pizza and freshness of products used on the pizza. 2 stars for not really having a specialty pizza this is where they get you with pricing. Total $71 ($20 just for 2 regular and 2 kid drinks) for a Single (14\") and Large (18\"). Even thou there was plenty to take home it seemed more main stream pizza attraction for the name Grimaldi's. Never had an opportunity to try the original yet in New York (bucket list haha) but if it's runs the same price, man it better taste a hell of a lot better cuz with that New York water seems to give it more flavor from what I heard. I did like our server she was very friendly and gave us great options for being 1st time goers in Grimaldi's. She recommended we could half the pizza red and white sauces, which were good. An she kept refilling my tea (hell for paying that much for drinks I was gonna get my monies worth). I mean it's a main stream pizzeria place to impress a client, family from out of town, or the occasional rewarding side of a special nite. But be prepared to spend a little."}
{"text":"I love this place ! the pizza is amazing with a fantastic crispy crust. The fire oven definitely helps in this. I highly recommend the fresh basil. I noticed something unique about this NY ambience. The lights dim every few minutes to mimic a NY Subway passing by. I am a pizza snob and this place rocks !"}
{"text":"Cracker pizza. Crust is as tasty as a saltine. Toppings were high quality but they dont give you much. My date and I spent 30.00 and I left hungry."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pizza, which is always spot on and delicious.  3 stars for service since on average things move very slowly"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, but over priced.  Generally feel like you are sitting on top of the people at the next table over.  Lots of tables crammed in a small area.  The best dining experience we have had there was in the small private room.  That was really nice and made the food more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Struck out at Cien Agaves and Tequila due to poor service at the desk discussed in my last review and ended up here . The opposite happened at Grimaldi's and we were seated with in 20 minutes when we're told an hour. Really good pizza and excellent service . I wish I had gotten her name ! We met some local friends here for dinner and were majorly surprised how good it was and made us glad we ended up here for dinner"}
{"text":"The pizza by itself, would for sure be 5 stars, but the overall experience, wasn't as good as I would have liked.  Like I said, pizza was delicious, nice sauce, crunchy, chewy crust, I was in pizza heaven. If they had one near my house, I'd get pizza every week.  The restaurant was nearly empty, yet when another couple came in, they sat them at the table right next to us.  My chair was touching the chair of the guy behind me.  I know, they need to squeeze in all the tables they can, but seriously, you have an empty restaurant and you pick to seat them right there?  Most of the antipasto was good, the roasted red peppers were excellent, the mozzarella, ok, but the salami was disappointing, it was ok, but was generic, grocery store salami.  We had 2 pieces of pizza, and some red peppers, olives and cheese left from the antipasto, so I told the waitress I wanted them to go, and she asked if the same box was ok.  I said yes, thinking the roasted red peppers and cheese would be put on a piece of wax paper or something so they weren't touching the cardboard.  Nope, just plopped right in the cardboard sucking up cardboard taste.  C'mon use a little common sense.  If you sign up for their email list, they'll send you a $5 off coupon."}
{"text":"Ate at this location last night and the pizza was good as always.  This location is larger and the tables spaced more apart than the Vegas location which was nice so at you aren't sitting on top of each other.  Drinks were refilled quickly, and the staff are on their toes here.  There was a mixup in our order, we had ordered a large cheese and a small white, but the kitchen reversed it.  Once they realized there mistake they promptly popped a large cheese in the oven while we ate the small and took all the leftovers to go.  I would not get the white pizza again, while it was good, I miss the flavor the sauce provides, to me the white pizza was just cheesy gRlic flatbread"}
{"text":"We had a party of 5 and we made a reservation for the patio. Their patio is nice in the way that it is enclosed by the building so there is no breeze. Do not think that you are being viewed by other diners because that is not the case. They also have outdoor heaters to keep it warm.  Colton was our waiter and he was phenomenal. Usually I am critical in waiters but he was always smiling, joking and seemingly interested in his job. He was very attentive and we had nothing but good things to say about him.  We all ordered either a pizza or a calzone and they were great. I was a bigger fan of the calzone as I am not a big pizza fan, but the pizza was also done well. We had about a 20 min wait for food, which is completely normal and is not excessive at all. We did have a gentleman come out, who I presume was the manager and informed us that he was not satisfied with how my calzone was cooked so they would remake it. I am shocked that someone would do this as I have never encountered a manager not being satisfied and taking matters into his own hands. They were apologetic, but it truly did not matter to me as I was enjoying the weather. Once the calzone got out, no more than 5 minutes, they offered to dish it up to me as well and it was by far the best calzone I have ever had.  Overall, I am extremely pleased with Grimaldi's and Colton as a waiter. I would consider this a top notch establishment with very respectful staff."}
{"text":"I just want to thank Grimaldi's for making my sons graduation party as perfect as I had hoped for.   The manager Robert called us ahead of time to make sure we had everything we needed so that our guests would not have to wait to eat, they had the back room ready for our 40 guests and he provided us with Sarah, the most perfect server. Everyone that came to celebrate was extremely impressed with their excellent service. I hope we get to come back for his college graduation. Again thank you, thank you, thank you."}
{"text":"We were staying at TI and yelped for nearby pizza. We were feeling lazy and tired so were glad we could get a pizza to go. We ordered the quattro formaggio with pepperoni. It was yummy. Service was fast."}
{"text":"First let me say that I've been eating at this location since it opened. We have always had good service and great food.   It was an 80 something degree day and the mall and the place was busy. We were told it was a 10-15 minute wait upon checking in. Waiting outside in the direct sun was a bit warm based on how we were dressed. We moved in side as space permitted. 15 minutes pass then 20.  I'm noticing everyone being seated now has arrived after us.   We approach the hostess and our name is not on their list. The hostess takes our name again and she adds it back on the list. So logic would dictate that we should be next after already waiting 20 plus minutes. Nope she continues to seat all the other parties that arrived after us.   So now I'm officially pissed off. After seating every other party she finally calls our party after 30 minutes and I tell my party were leaving. We walk out but I go back inside and let the manager know what transpired. He's very gracious and offers to seat us. He acknowledges the hostess should have sat us asap. While I appreciate that I'm not spending my money any longer at this place and let him know that.   Your poorly trained hostess cost you a customer. And I will pass the word along to anyone else That will listen."}
{"text":"Our pizza didnt turn out as expected but our waiter Austin and the manager both checked on us multiple times to see if we were okay.. don't worry we were, and boy were we In pizza heaven. They offered us a slice of cheesecake or making our pizza over again and we chose the cheesecake which was to die for! Thank you austin for being an awesome waiter! We love grimaldis so much definitely will be coming back to this location again!"}
{"text":"Create your own pizza and get a karafe of sangria.    Follow those orders above and you're guaranteed to have a good dinner.  First dinner in vegas at 11:30 at night, my buddies and I walk around the canal shoppes and happen upon Grimaldi's. So clutch. so clutch.  The prices aren't boosted because of the Vegas location, so the prices of pizza you see here are the same as on the East Coast!   A large pizza pie will feed 3 hungry men, depending on how much of the sangria you've ingested by the time the pizza comes around, but some toppings that create a pizza thats on point, in my opinion, are artichoke hearts, italian sausage, and pepperoni and olives. OOOO... I want Grimaldi's now... but so far... Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service however was awful. From the host at the front with his nasty attitude to the server who kept disappearing. Will not be returning here... There's too many other places in this city to put up with bad service."}
{"text":"I love me some pizza. I have tried all kinds. Since coming to Vegas, this is my go to place. The pizza is fantastic. Coal brick oven pizza with real mozzarella and fresh toppings. My wife is a huge fan of their caprese and caesar salads as well. Great staff. Very friendly and welcoming. And save room for their Oreo cookie cheesecake...the best!"}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas, one came out fine after which the waiter repeatedly said \"your other pizza will be coming right out.\"  But after 20 minutes of announcements of the pizza's imminent arrival, I finally called the waiter over to tell him there was obviously a problem. The second pizza order was apparently misplaced by the manager and was never made. The pizza arrived another 10 minutes later and the manager came by to say he would \"make things right.\" At that point the people in our party who had ordered the second pizza did not want to have the rest of us who had already finished their meal wait for them, and only ate one slice each leaving half the pizza.   The bill came and for the manager \"making things right\" was to remove the charge for the second pizza. To me that would have been the starting point, since the meal had been ruined for everyone.   Four stars for the pizza and zero stars for an incompetent manager and indifferent waiter."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's had a good pizza selection and was able to promptly serve our party of 20 on short notice. We had several of each of the pizzas on the menu, each of them was promptly consumed with great acclaim.   The pizza was good, would recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped in about an hour before closing and ordered a calzone for dine in. The service was nice, not over bearing and not absent, always there when needed. The calzone was great. Sauce was seasoned but not spicy and the mozzarella tasted fresh. My only caution would be pricing. The calzone which was 12\" personal sized was $10-then come the toppings at $2-$3 each. The $10 calzone quickly became the $17 calzone. I inquired about a side Caesar salad and it was $7 so I skipped it.  If you want great pizza or calzones and price is acceptable then this place is a must try. Personally it was a bit high."}
{"text":"Really delicious pizza! Cooked in a brick oven, the crust is one of my favorite (I usually don't eat it). The four cheese pizza has a strong, sharp flavor. I enjoyed every bite! I recommend the personal pizza size, as even this \"small\" was too big to finish alone. I would have ordered dessert if I didn't keep devouring my pizza until I was beyond stuffed.   As an out-of-towner, I'm very pleased I found this place. It made for a great business dinner while watching the NBA playoffs."}
{"text":"Perfect crust means perfect pizza.  The char the oven puts on it, the chewy texture and crunchy crust makes the slices of these pies go fast. I always seem bothered that they don't serve wings or garlic bread until I eat a piece of their pizza and forget all about everything else. Grimaldi's does pizza right.   We ordered two pizzas, one with pepperoni and basil and the other with artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, basil and roasted garlic. Both equally tasty. I love that they use full slices of mozzarella and not shreds. It makes the pizza more authentic. We also ordered a caprese salad with fresh basil, mozzarella and thick slices of tomato.   For take-out or dine in, Grimaldi's is on my top list of great pizza."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in Las Vegas. I've been to many different pizza restaurants, and this is by far the best.   The environment is pretty tight. Not a whole lot of space. They can accommodate mid-size parties, but wouldn't recommend a table larger than 10.   Their salads are also delicious. We like the Mediterranean Salad. I'm a simple guy on pizza toppings, so pepperoni is my favorite. Haven't tried their desert, but there's plenty of good ice cream in the area.   The staff is friendly and the service is quick. It's a great place!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended, the whole family enjoyed the pizza. The service could be faster and would be nice to have a selection of appetizers. It was on the pricey side. Very fresh ingredients. Long wait to get in but I can't blame them for people lining up for their food."}
{"text":"I really love it here. The pizza is seriously delicious which has been consistent on these reviews but an important thing to note is the staff has had serious improvements in the past year or so. So the other reviews may have been old or just during one of their super busy moments - from personal experience I know Saturday nights are crazy there!  On Sunday, I go during the evenings and sit at the bar. They always have football on during the season and the bartender for Sunday evening shifts is great. He is attentive and has an awesome personality (even if I pick on his Seahawks jersey.. Which I do only because I'm a bitter niners fan)   I recommend strongly for good atmosphere and food! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Great thin pizza with fresh mozz and plenty of toppings. The kalamata olives were a bit too salty for me. Good caprese salad and large 'small' salads. The small pizza is definitely not small either. Oh all you east-coasters and your moving to AZ gig."}
{"text":"I was kind of iffy because it is located in the mall, and mall food quality seems to plummet ... But ....Oh my goodness!!!  They need to open up a Grimaldis closer to me!! I was super bummed I didn't get to try it in NYC but this is my second best option. If this is how good it is here.... I really missed out because it must be like 8482919 times better on the east coast.  I just wanted to sit there all day and just eat pizza.  Our waiter was super nice and made our dining experience that much better!! Please deliver this to me!! It's only a plane ride away."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my dad who was visiting me a while ago. We decided to get lunch before hitting up the Avenger's Station at Treasure Island.   Located in the Fashion Show Mall it's at the far end where they sometimes play movies inside of the mall which where they sometimes have their fashion runway. Moana was playing at the time so it was a bit noisy but other then that it was an enjoyable experience for my dad & I.  We ordered a medium ( I think ) pesto pizza with black olives. I'm a huge pesto (& olives addict honestly) fan & my dad had never had it before ( I mean seriously?!) so I decided he must experience this greatest once & for all. We got some sodas to go with it & called it a day. Although it was lunch time, we both had not ate anything yet so 2-3 slices each was more then enough for both of us!   The crust on the pizza was a tad burnt. It didn't make it bad but I'd prefer normal. My dad however is a burnt bread type of person so he actually preferred it that way. To each their own! If you like it cooked longer then you'll like the pizza here. Taste was decent enough & waiter was nice. Checked on us every once in a while & made sure we were doing alright.   While this place isn't bad there wasn't anything stand out about this place. It's your typical American Italian style pizzeria with that red checkered look that a lot of them have. It's a cozy little chain restaurant. We enjoyed our time there & I wouldn't mind coming back if by chance I was invited by a friend or was craving pizza while shopping."}
{"text":"Great antipasto! Bread melted in my mouth.  Great pizza!  From perspective of a native New Yorker--these guys know their pizza!  We had the the don pizza--deelish!   Hate to compare it to NY Grimaldi's but the pizza here had less of a burnt crust taste so  you couild really appreciate the tasty ingredients.  We're here on vacation but if you're in Vegas and want authentic NY pizza, e eat at Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"The Mediterranean salad is to die for!!!! Hostest and waiter were super nice and sweet. Pizza was good but not sure why they added basil before putting in oven. Basil on pie came out black and crispy lol"}
{"text":"Solid pizza place. It's a wood fire pizza. Very simple and fresh. It takes awhile to get a seat if you go on a Friday or Saturday night. The good news is that you can put your name and number down. They will text you when your table is ready. This way, you can go shop around the mall."}
{"text":"The pizza and service here were quite good.  No complaints on either.  Pricewise it was maybe a little high, but I wouldn't consider it outrageous.  If you want some sitdown pizza in Vegas, this is the joint."}
{"text":"I registered on their website last month after hearing that they give you a free pizza on your birthday. Being that time of year I took advantage of the offer. It was a Tuesday night and the place was pretty crowded. We sat at a small table just off the bar and it was a little chilly since there is an open air area that services an outside patio. We ordered a lg pizza with meatballs. The pizza was excellent but i'm not sure I would order the meatballs again. Tiramisu was for dessert. It was also very good. Our server was outstanding. Pretty upbeat and talkative (in a good way) he was there to check on us quite often."}
{"text":"This is the most amazingly delicious pizza. I would highly recommend the white pizza sauce with garlic. Manager Joey was very nice, came over introduced himself and bought us a cheesecake.. best service ever!!!"}
{"text":"After shopping around during the Yelp Local Cash Mob Event, there were about 12 yelpers remaining from from the original 20-25 shoppers and we all met up at Grimaldi's for the after party.  We all recieved a $5 gift card to use towards any additional purchase towards additional food and alcohol. The pizzas and cannolis we pigged out on were compliments of Grimaldi's.  We shared a small house salad while we were waiting for the pizzas and it was pretty huge for a small! The pizzas came out and we had 5 large pizzas-2 Cheese, 1 Sausage, 1 Pepperoni, and 1 White. This is not my favorite kinda pizza, but it was pretty decent. I personally prefer a more thicker, chewy crust like NY or Neapolitan style. Toppings were also pretty good, and my favorite one was the White Pizza.(Rocco's House White still gets my vote though). One of the managers later came out with a tray of Cannolis and said \"don't be shy\", so everyone had about 2 or 3 and there were still leftovers!  Service was awesome, and it was a great way to cap off a day of shopping local...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Like most girls before a Vegas trip, I was on that \"Vegas Body Diet.\" You know, the one where I'd eat super healthy and work out twice a day. (Not... I don't have THAT much self control over my love for food.) However, I did think *really* hard about portion controlling my food during my first night.   That is, until we went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria for dinner. After the first bite into my pizza slice, I knew it was game over. I didn't care if I looked pudgy in my skin tight dress in a few hours. I NEEDED to shove more of this amazing pizza into my mouth!   (To be fair, we also ordered a salad to feel healthy. And it was a really good salad!)  Since I was with two Vegas n00bies, I was egging them on to start drinking before we ate. At first, they declined. But they gave in when our server came over and told them people who visit Vegas should be drunk all the time. I quickly nodded in agreement... and we ordered a carafe of white sangria. #win I do love fun servers who make my dining experience even more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Very decent pizza, and decent service. Believe it or not, the salad is even better than the pizza.  The location in Boca Park is convenient, and very pretty and trendy.  They keep the doors open on warm days, which gives a good indoor/outdoor kind of feeling.  The prices are what you would expect.  I like that the pizza is on a pedestal.  Be sure to try different toppings and share."}
{"text":"This was recommended by a Segway tour guide while I was on a tour. I must say this was a delicious pizza joint that reminded me of the east coast. The cheese pizza was great and the price was incredibly affordable considering it seemed like a fancy dining restaurant. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Menu is pretty simple. Pizza and Salad but its the best pizza I've ever had!  Thin crust new York style pizza with quality ingredients. The sausage is amazing and I'm not usually a sausage pizza person. Service was great and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"We had some time (40 minutes) before our movie started so we thought it would be a good spot to grab some food, and it was not busy at all on a friday night so we thought that would help with time too. We go in and even though the place is empty we are sat in a tiny dark corner and left to look at our menus. We sat for about 10 minutes and then we had to get up and go over to the several girls standing at the hostess stand and asked where our server was, after another 3 minutes or so he finally showed up and took our drink and food orders, the food took some time but did show up. It was good and I liked the brick oven taste it had but then they messed up on (and again took forever) to get our dessert order. We only saw our server once, no refills offered on our drinks and it was all together a horrible experience, and late 10 min to our movie. Next time we will go over to toby keith's place a short walk up instead!"}
{"text":"Pizza is only ok. If you like the crunchy thin crust with loads of toppings, this isn't for you. The middle of the pizza was soggy and limp. Prices are a little high. Just not impressed with Old Town food."}
{"text":"This place is definitely going to be my go to pizza place when staying on the strip. Stopped by for a fun dinner on a bachelorette night out. Waiter was great. We shared the large pest pizza with pepperoni and spinach. Delicioso! Two slices of the pizza had cheese that melted off onto the other slices so they were crispy and essentially just bread. Someone came out and offered is a personal pizza or dessert as a replacement. We went with the personal pizza since we were filling up as we were ready to drink the might away. To top it off a group of guys sitting next to us gave us a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"I do not know why this place is famous at all. My younger brother also think the same way."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time and arrived during stoking.  We had to wait about 45 minutes for the oven to be ready.  Keep in mind they stoke the oven around 3:30-4:30. So be prepared to wait if you arrive around that time. We were in no rush so we had small salads.  The small salad is big, so you can split it.  When the pizza arrived we were not disappointed.  It is very good and made fresh to order."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza ever. And it's really too bad that there isn't one in the Bay Area. I usually never eat pizza crust but for Grimaldi's I will! The pizza came out hot from the brick oven. There was something comforting and phenomenal about their pizza that I can't describe.  Service was great and friendly. We didn't think the filtered water is so important until we asked the waiter. It's a serious deal! One time their machine broke that they had to collect the filtered water from another location."}
{"text":"Only Coal-Fired Pizza Oven in Las Vegas. The flavor that the coal oven gives the crust is one of the factors that makes them a contender in the new round of reviews for Las Vegas Best Pizza dot com.  This location gets very busy around 4pm when they stoke the fire. It is bwst to enjoy their pizza dining in as tge crispness of the crust degenerates by the minute on take-out, as it steams in the box. Toppings are always fresh and they have actually stepped up their recipes since the last round of reviews for the site.  Their outdoor seating give you a chance to smell the exhaust from the pizzas cooking in that coal oven, something you cant get anywhere else in Vegas, other than Grimaldi's.  Worth the price and worth the wait. After 30+ visits to get an across-the-board average, they are definitely up there with the front-runners now."}
{"text":"So our friend brought a group of us to Grimaldi's. He said every time he's in Vegas he makes it a point to dine here. I was very pleasantly surprised with my first bite of the pizza. There were seven of us and we shared 3 large pizzas. (Pepperoni & Italian sausage, pepperoni & cheese, and pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms & jalapeños) Two of the guys were from the east coast and they even said it was the best pie they ever tasted. I enjoyed the pizza with a Caesar salad and the red house wine. I was in food heaven for the time we were there. I even ordered a pizza to go and ate some the next day. It was wonderful even cold! We will definitely make it a point to dine in every time we visit Vegas. Bon Appetite to the 10th degree!"}
{"text":"What kind of ex-Brooklynite would I came to Sin City but didn't check this place out? :-)  It was just another sweltering hot holiday weekend in Vegas.  I spent the the afternoon sipping cocktails by the pool, and the morning riding the coasters of Stratosphere Tower; it's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it! :-)  We wanted to go to Grimaldi's for an early dinner to allow plenty of time to get to Kevin Burke's one-man comedy, \"Defending the Caveman\" at Harrah's; we walked into the restaurant just after 5.  The atmosphere was convivial, warm, and very New York - in a Vegas sort of way;-)  There are checkered tablecloths, and lots of brick.     Grimaldi's makes their pizzas in coal-fired ovens.  Why?  They say that pizza and Calzones baked in their signature coal burning oven offers a crisp crust and a unique flavor and that is just not possible using gas, convection or wood burning ovens, and that their handmade mozzarella, fresh ingredients , 'secret recipe' dough and pizza sauce make them the most award winning pizzeria in the United States.  Quite the hype - will the Carboholic's Delights they serve at Grimaldi's stand up to it?  To find out we ordered a personal coal-fired NY pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, and garlic. Also a Calzone with pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms.  Grimaldi's menu lacks any non-veggie starters; given that the pizza doesn't take very long to cook, that's not a show-stopper, but it sure wouldn't hurt if they added garlic bread or Bruschetta for those of us who like to eat carbs while they wait for their carbs...  We didn't wait long for our food, but I was still very eager to try mine!   Grimaldi's original venue was built underneath the Brooklyn Bridge long before my personal Escape from New York, but I never heard of it until recently; that made me several decades overdue for my first Grimaldi's fix.  Saving what I assumed would be the best for last I started with the Calzone.  Ricotta cheese is a default with Grimaldi's Calzone; it was smooth, creamy, and delicious!  Given it to do over again, next time I'll include sausage, but the taste of this Thing of carb-intensive Beauty was wonderfully balanced even without meat - I don't think I've ever tasted a Calzone this good!  Moving on to the meat of the matter, let's talk about Grimaldi's pizza!  Unlike a lot of NY pizzerias, Grimaldi's sells only whole pies; no single slices are available.  I was surprised when I saw the thickness of the crust up close and personal - for my money it's distinctly thinner than traditional NY Pizza; not quite Neapolitan, but getting pretty close.  It was so thin that I was a little concerned about this pizza's ability to stand up under another meat topping and extra cheese, so we went with just the two meat toppings and garlic; no problems with \"independent suspension\" on the first or second slices.  It was a slight issue with my friend's third, but nothing major.  What did it taste like?  The scent of basil leaf added an enticingly to the pizza's delicious aroma; I took a bite and the sauce yielded a burst of fresh tomato flavor; the cheese was exquisite!  It's not shredded - it's pure white, fresh mozzarella cheese, melted on the surface into a nice, thick chewy texture.  The crust, slightly charred by the coal-fired ovens, was crisp and chewy; the flavors of the sauce, the pools of cheese, and the toppings blended into a deliciously satisfying pizza experience!  With friendly, efficient service, incredible pizza and Calzones, and five locations in Las Vegas, Grimaldi's is an exceptional star pizza joint that is now a permanent part of my Sin City rotation.  I enjoyed this visit so much that I just may check out the Mother Ship when next I return to the Big Apple.  Tip: There's only one thing wrong with Grimaldi's, and one reason I can't give them a five star rating  - absolutely no outside wine or liquor is allowed.  Who knew that on Grimaldi's world Atlas, Las Vegas is now a part of Kansas? ;-)"}
{"text":"Over priced pizza. Snotty service. Been here 5 or 6 times hoping it will get better each time.  My wife politely asked for a side of ranch and the server scoffed and told her they don't serve ranch. Way better pizza all over gilbert, cheaper too. Skip this place."}
{"text":"This picture basically sums up my recent experience at Grimaldi's. We went on September 10th which was a very busy night. They were doing their cancer awareness promotion or Fight Hunger promotion I can't remember which and also the Scottsdale Quarter was hosting a live free concert so it was very busy. The staff was attentive, nice and extremely accommodating. Anything I asked for in relation to getting my son fed ASAP. The manager seen here, even came over to check in with my son personally to make sure everything was good. Giving him smiles and allowing my husband and I a couple minutes to ourselves to eat. He was so sweet that the manager even took a plate with a piece of pizza back to the kitchen freezer for exactly 2 minutes for it to cool so that my son could eat as soon as possible. My experience deserves 5 Stars it was excellent! Thank you Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Okay, so I have been to this Grimaldi's plenty of times over the years, but it was my most recent visit that pushed me to write a review. My husband and I had a super low key holiday season this year (which was pretty amazing by the way) and decided to go out for some pizza on Christmas Eve. We were pleasantly surprised that the place was pretty busy. There's nothing worse than eating in an empty restaurant...wouldn't you agree?  Anyway...we were greeted by a friendly hostess who quickly took us to one of the few open tables still available. She chatted with us as we walked and gave us an informative spiel as we sat down at our cozy spot by the kitchen. (Important sidenote: I love that you can watch the pizza-makers doing their thing.) Shortly thereafter, our server, Adrienne, came to greet us and take our order. She was super friendly and I knew immediately we were going to be receiving good service throughout our meal. Like I mentioned above, the place was busy and my husband and I watched as Adrienne went from table to table throughout the evening. She had several big tables at the time, yet never missed a beat. She was attentive, relaxed, and knowledgeable.    We started with a small salad which I think was a bit overpriced, even if it is a decent size. Then we moved on to a small cheese pizza. Grimaldi's \"small\" is a lot more like a medium so it was a good option for two of us. When Adrienne brought our pizza out she informed us that apparently our pizza wasn't as big as it should have been so the manager ordered us a personal sized pizza as well. A free pizza with our pizza? Don't mind if I do!   So I guess the point of this whole review is to make one major point...the service here is pretty awesome. And no, I haven't had the same service at other Grimaldi's locations. The Old Town location definitely seems a step above the other versions I've visited around town. Their atmosphere is better, it's always a bit busier, and it's officially been determined that the service here is way better than the majority of restaurants around town. If you're looking for a good pizza this is definitely a great option. Ask for Adrienne and add some olive oil to your pizza...I promise it will add up to a delicious meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a commercial style pizza that really hits the comfort food spot, then this is your place. During our several visits to this location, we've had good service, excellent people-watching, and tasty food.   This newer building really can't compare to the character of the Old Town location, but it does have plenty of outdoor seating and a decent atmosphere inside. I like that they stay open a little later than some restaurants in the area. Nothing like a late night pizza after a long, busy day."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I was so excited to come here the day before I got my teeth pulled for one last yummy meal for the week and I just wasn't happy. Right when I picked up my pizza almost everything fell off..yes I had almost every vegetable on it but still the dough was soft in the middle like undercooked maybe? Spending the $62 on pizza I wasn't letting it go to waste. And I've always had great service here except this time just went a little downhill, our waitress was great for taking our orders and filling our drinks once but when it came to the check, it took 20 mins to get it and yes she kept passing our table, not really in length of getting her attention I guess. She finally comes to the table next to ours and was about to walk away again! I finally got her attention...I just won't be back unless I'm in the mood for soft dough pizza"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!!! I'm so happy they finally started serving gluten free pizza (and it's so good). Daevon is really funny and a great bartender/server."}
{"text":"nice to have grimaldi on the strip.  perfect for sharing in the room. giordanos also opened on the strip for deep dish"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Best pizza around. We used to get red sauce with pepperoni and extra mozz. It is sooo good! Now we get the \"Christmas\" pizza. It's red sauce with pesto on top. We get it with pepperoni and extra mozz!"}
{"text":"After having BJs the night before I wasn't sure how great of an idea Grimaldis was, but I had been wanting to try it for months and my family said they were game. I thank God that they did. Talk about top notch ingredients and fresh right out of the oven super crispy pizza. The service was excellent, as was the atmosphere. This is a place I could easily make a once a week spot. Believe the hype on this one and come try it."}
{"text":"What can I say...staff was very friendly,  made me feel very welcomed. ..and the establishment looked and felt like I was in Italy having great pizza, but I was , having the best pizza in the world. Just that I was just not in Italy I was in the best city in the world las vegas....price is great. . Big pizzas worth the trip all the way loved it##!"}
{"text":"I'd been hearing rave reviews and saw the billboards showcasing that they were highly rated in the valley so I decided to give their pizza a try.  I invited my sister to join me for dinner and we must've missed the lunch rush as there were only about 3-4 tables occupied when I sat down on 11/28/15.  My sister was running late so I asked for some bread and it never made it to the table so I asked again later.  We asked for water and had questions about the menu and the server said he would be back.  I noticed that the server was also the bartender and wasn't sure why the other 3-4 workers weren't helping patrons.  The cost of the restaurant is a bit pricey for me so I thought maybe the quality and service would justify it.    The restaurant started getting busier and we heard another hostess go over the specials which did not happen with me.  My sister and I started laughing because they started getting busier and after about 10 minutes, we made a decision to leave.  We did let the bartender know we changed our mind and we were leaving which I thought would've prompted a question about why but that never happened.  We walked past the hostess and she never said good night or anything as we left.  I can't really review the food or drinks as we were only able to get bread and water.    I am a big believer in letting the business know when there is an issue before posting a negative review so they have an opportunity to make it right.  I called the restaurant on our way to Picazzo's down the street and spoke with the manager.  He did apologize but my concern was that he never asked for my name or for an opportunity to make it right.  I would've expected for him to ask for another chance or asked for us to return at a later date so he could do something to fix our bad experience. Maybe we just hit them on a bad day but Picazzo's was amazing, more attentive, cheaper, had happy hour specials, and was delicious."}
{"text":"I've eaten here at Grimaldi's quite a few times. I mainly hit them up during the spring & fall to take advantage of their outdoor seating. One of the secret to their pizza & salads is that you can customize them with some of the most awesome ingredients available. I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes, but here, I put them on everything. They are truly the bomb!  My last adventure here was last night, but not as a customer in the traditional sense. I work for PostMates as a delivery driver & was picking up an order for a regular customer of mine.The 'take out' staff was extremely helpful, thorough & made sure my order was perfect. While it means a lot to me as a delivery driver, it means so much more to my/their customers. No missing items, always crushed pepper & parm, utensils, etc. They make my job EASY. If you want to find out for yourself, just download the app and put in code KCOLE for $10 in delivery credit. Not only will you be getting some of the best pizza in town, you'll be getting some of the best service as well."}
{"text":"I went for my first time last night. I was won over by the food, but put off by the service and atmosphere.  Our server greeted us promptly, was very friendly and was quick to take drink orders. After that, it kinda went down hill. We waited a while for him to come back to take out food order. (Sidenote, we ordered The Don and damn it was good!) The server came by once after our pizza was dropped off at the table and then we didn't see him again until he brought the check. I sat with an empty water for a good 10 minutes. It didn't seem like they were short staffed, so not sure what the deal was.  Another note....don't get the table for two in the row by the kitchen and next to the bathrooms. You get the be distracted by the servers drumming at the server station while they wait for orders to come up. You have people standing right behind you if there is a line for the bathroom. You get to hear the servers screaming and carrying on. You may even get dusted with ground pepper while a server swings the grinder around.  I'll be dining at Grimaldi's again. But if I go back to that location I definitely won't take that table."}
{"text":"Great pizza with garlic bread! Honestly, skip the staff, pizza will make up for any misdemeanors you receive. A family friendly and fun place to go."}
{"text":"Having lived in this hood for almost three years, THIS is my favorite pizza, period. I loved having a gin & tonic or their house red while sitting in the patio/courtyard; the dough they brought for my daughter to make a pizza out of while our delicious coal fired Italian black olive and mushroom pizza was getting blazen fire licks of love.  The rooms that line the courtyard are great for larger indoor/outdoor parties. We can't wait to visit!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Crust was super hard and a little burnt. Had regular with basil, basil was yummy. Had to try before leaving Vegas. Wasn't worth the price IMO."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a personal favorite though it's a little on the pricey side for pizza. Praying for the day they put their Seasonal Rosemary Potato Pizza on their everyday menu. I'm drooling just thinking about it! All their pizzas are amazing, though I definitely recommend eating it there as it's just not the same when you take it home as it is fresh out the coal brick oven. Ask for Tricia as your server she's our favorite, super nice and makes every dining experience pleasurable! As a regular she knows I love my water with a lot of lemons and always delivers. As I'm writing this review I'm starting to crave it, so I'll probably be eating it tomorrow lol"}
{"text":"New to area & on hunt for great pizza. Had it delivered by Postmates. Honestly the WORST pizza ever. Never again Large margarita pizza w mushroom , sausage & pepperoni. Personal pesto w chix & mushroom. $67 ??! ! If it was great would be different. Threw them both out."}
{"text":"We had an impromptu Valentine's dinner here. We were headed to the movies and we were hungry.  You must know all they offer are salads, pizza and calzones.  They have a good wine selection ( a little on the pricey side).    We had the Caprese salad (tomato/fresh mozzarella/basil).  The tomato was little under-ripe, but the mozz was delish, and the basil was huge!  We also shared a personal size calzone with pepperoni, meatball, and onion.  It was very good!  I like that they serve the sauce on the side so it isn't soggy inside the calzone.  The cheese was so creamy.  Trust me, the personal size is 12 inches, enough to share between 2 people!  I had a $10 glass of wine, M had iced tea and it totalled $38.  Not bad!"}
{"text":"LOVE Grimaldi's!!!  Order is always right and staff is always great.  One complaint is that bathroom isn't family friendly."}
{"text":"locals and tourists need to try this place, their white pizza is the best"}
{"text":"Having my own little quest to find the best pie in Vegas... this place does it right... one bite everybody knows the rules...8.4"}
{"text":"We arrived at 630 and ordered food. We finally left at 830 after waiting for 2 hours.  Manager was apologetic but never in my life has food taken 2 hours. We actually walked out, which is something we never have done. Absolutely ridiculous and infuriating.  Kitchen can't seem to get their act together.  My cousin went 2 days earlier and had similar experience."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times & they still have the best Ricotta on a pizza. The pizza I always order: Red sauce, Ricotta cheese, sausage and/or pepperoni, and fresh basil on top... I could eat this pizza for days!!  Other items I've tried on their menu are: Calzone, Caprese, Mediterranean Salad, House Salad, and their Margherita Pizza. All were delicious.  Ambiance is nice & classy, service is good, but prices are a little higher than other pizza places. However, the quality of their food & ambiance make up for it.  The only improvement I'd like is to have the option to get thicker crust as their pizzas are thin crust. Nonetheless, it's still tasty!"}
{"text":"Pizza was fantastic! This is a hidden treasure near the Shops at Palazzo. This is NOT food court grade pizza. This is nice coal fired thin pizza.   Grabbed a couple salads to keep from feeling quite as guilty. They were good salads for the money but I recommend passing on them and saving room for a pizza.   We got one large for three men and it was plenty. There were 8 slices so one guy gets screwed and only gets two pieces so make sure to eat fast!   If you are the unlucky one don't worry. There are plenty of good desserts on the menu to top you off. We got the cheesecake which was very delicious.   Service was fast and courteous. This is very great choice if you are looking for casual lunch while in the Palazzo or Venetian."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place on the planet. The staff is always friendly and on top of everything and the pizza is absolutely wonderful. I'll order a pizza, take it home and have the rest for breakfast because it's just as good cold as it is hot. :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza and service! Devon is super attentive and the pizza is delicious and the beer is cold. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Group of five Saturday night, Seated in the bar right quick.  Where else can you do this in Old Scottsdale?  Waiter suggested just the right amount of pizza, we would not have ordered enough.  Salads were fresh and the large portion definitely sharable.  thin crust pizza heaven!  dessert?  I tried a spoonful of cannoli, discovered I never really had true cannoli before this!  priced right."}
{"text":"This is one pizza place I will continue to come back for.  The food is always consistent and the service is very good.  Also, if you sign up for the email program, you get a free large cheese pizza on your birthday week.  The manager, Anh,  is always helping the employees and asking all the customers how their meal was.  Very good involved manager to make sure your experience was always good."}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to NYC and a huge fan of the famous Lombardi's Pizza I am a firm believer that coal fired is the undisputed champ of Pizza. Grimaldi's is a direct descendent of Lombardi's beginning in the 1930's and it shows as they have remained true to their NY roots.  I make it a point to over order when I go there so I have plenty to bring home. I always start with the Caprese Salad or Anti Pasta platter, either way I get that amazing fresh mozzarella that dances across the old taste buds that can't be described in a PG rated review.  They have done something to maintain the same consistent crust you won't find anybody else doing. They have a special tap that creates \"Brooklyn water\" specifically and only for the crust.   The fresh mozzarella and sauce speak for themselves, if you feel Pizza Hut makes a great Pizza, then go to Pizza Hut. You aren't qualified for Grimaldi's.  A++++"}
{"text":"If u haven't eaten here you're missing out.  If you have, I don't know why you're reading this review instead of eating pizza right now.  This place has amazing dough. Amazing sauce amazing toppings. Yum yum yum. If you don't mind going H.A.M. on the price of some pizza this is the place for you.   Only thing close in town is five 50 @ Aria"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town, and amazing customer service. On a recent visit they brought us out  our pizza, apologized that it was slightly overdone and had already started us a new one."}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's because of the high marks in Yelp.   On vacation with relatives, we went in with a party of 13 including a 6-year-old, two 4-year-olds, and a 1-year-old. Found out pretty quickly Grimaldi's isn't the best pizza place for young kids or parents with young kids. The place is kind of intimate (i.e., small). So when you sit, the back of your chair slams up against your neighbor's. So, because we had little kids, we spent the entire time sitting down, getting up, banging neighbors, apologizing - repeat till fed up.  Asked for a kid menu - \"no.\" Asked if they had mac and cheese, or spaghetti with tomato sauce, or buttered pasta - \"no, only pizza.\" Asked if they had a vegetarian pizza, or a \"Hawaiian\" pizza, or a BBQ chicken pizza - \"uhhh, yeah, we don't have that.\" WTH?  The left side of their menu is pizza. The right side of their menu is salad. There is no other side. And they don't have combinations. They have ingredients and you pick what you want. And as each ingredient is around $3 bucks, if you want a \"vegetarian\", tack on  an extra $30!!! So, $46 for a large vegetarian pizza. Again, WTH?  We ordered a pizza with red sauce and extra cheese for the kids, and a pizza with red sauce, tomatoes and basil, and a pizza with white sauce, fresh garlic, and mushroom for the adults. The red sauce pizzas were kind of bleh - very little sauce and only spots of cheese. Literally. Spots. Of. Cheese. If you're looking for a pizza covered, smothered, and dripping with yummy melting cheese (and we ordered extra cheese, remember?), what we received was not it. Not even close. Picture this: a pizza with a small to medium amount of pepperoni. Now replace the pepperoni with cheese. That's the Grimaldi's \"extra cheese\" pizza! haha  The white sauce pizza, with mushrooms, on the other hand, was a different story. The white sauce itself was like an excellent alfredo sauce, with butter, and parmesan, and tons of garlic. And, unlike the red sauce, they actually put a decent amount of it on the pizza. The white sauce pizza was that pizza where you can't wait for one of your friends to try it just so they can tell you, \"yes, you're right, that's fricken' amazing.\" It was one of the best pizzas I'd ever tasted.  If we lived closer, my wife and I would go to Grimaldi's and, with a white sauce pizza with a couple beers, we'd be in heaven. Going in there with a party of 13, four of them little ones, and with it being a not-so-kid-friendly establishment, this was more like hell."}
{"text":"I'm new in town, and I know I should give more pizza places a shot, but I keep coming back to grimaldi's!  Crispy, thin crust, fresh mozzarella, baked in a brick oven... There's nothing better. There's pictures of New York everywhere in this place, but I never had anything this good when I was over there. This is pizza in its purest form: quality ingredients, well-balanced flavors. Even when I finish a whole personal pizza and I leave completely stuffed, I never feel gross. The crust is light and airy, unlike other pizzerias that serve thick, bready, cardboard-like crust.  With the extensive topping list, the possibilities are endless. This is typical of pizza restaurants, but this is the first place I've been to where all the ingredients seem to mesh perfectly. No matter what toppings I choose, it always comes out tasting like it was meant to be! My go-to is meatball and pesto sauce. Try it!  The passion fruit tea is awesome! The last time I went, the restaurant was a little busy so I don't think filling my glass was a priority for my server. Such a bummer, because the tea is actually one of the reasons I keep coming back and I've never been disappointed at grimaldi's before this.  I'll let it slide though because the food was great.  So far, this is one of my favorite places to eat in town. It's a great place to grab a quick bite and a beer with friends, or a quiet date (if you come after the lunch rush)."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is amazing. I've been to the OG Hoboken location, and I didn't realize it was a chain until recently. They have locations in the Palazzo Las Vegas, Arizona, Texas, Florida, and NYC.  This place is just as good as the Hoboken location, if not a tad bit better. We arrived at 7:30pm on a Friday night and it was at about 90% capacity. There were two open tables inside and we grabbed one of them. The restaurant seems small from the outside but it's huge once you step inside. The bar is roomy, they have a private dining room and main dining room, plus a huge patio.   The food was unbelievable, and service was top notch.  Adrienne was super nice without being fake. She was friendly and just did a great job. She refilled out waters when they were half empty, cleared our plates on time, and gave us new silverware as needed.  We ordered a large sausage, olive, and mushroom pizza with a caprese salad. The pizza was so gooood. It was thin but not too thin, the crust was chewy and not dry. It was so much food and we were so full after 3 slices each that we couldn't finish the final two pieces. The bill came to $36 with tax and tip, and it was well worth it. This location is a must visit when you're in the Scottsdale Area. They have another Scottsdale location, but I went here based on the higher Yelp rating."}
{"text":"the place was really good. all the pizzas were really good. i enjoyed the superior customer service. that guy was really cool. the wine was good but more samples could of been nice. don't know if ill come again. but i'm definitely coming again. lol :) the pizza is good. :) the environment was really cool."}
{"text":"I have been the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge & the location in NYC and I have to say...  Eating at the Peoria location brings me back to my NY trips!  Of course, without the heavy winter coat, shaking in the cold, and wind in my face while waiting for 45 mins for a table for two.  I am here in AZ, in flipflops and enjoying the weather while waiting outside on the bench!  :)    The service was great (no asking for refills).  He checked on us a few times.  I had the white pizza with chicken and bacon...  YUM!  I am still in love with the regular red sauce.  Guess I need to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Brooklyn Grimaldi's, so the bar was set high.  I was so disappointed when the pie came out soggy.  BOOOO!!!!!   The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Been busy with work and haven't written a review in a while so I figure it's about time i contribute.  I've been meaning to try Grimaldi's at the new Park West complex for a while now.  I'd heard good things from family members, and last week the opportunity finally presented itself.  The first thing I noticed is that their lobby is virtually non existent, tons of people huddled around the hostess podium with a wait upwards of 30 minutes.  To be fair it's about 6:30PM on a friday and they have a bar, but the bar is completely full as well. many patrons were waiting around the edge of the glass enclosed kitchen in the middle of the restaurant which I found odd.  When we finally got seated our waiter greated us promptly with what seemed like a very \"forced\" brooklyn accent, \" Ya Evah Been Heeyah Befo,... It's Good Pie\" pleasantries aside he was very prompt and took good care of the table.  He even gave my neice who was with us some pizza dough to keep her occupied.  I ordered an individual red sauce pizza with with pepperoni, sausage and mushroom.  They have 3 different sauces, red, white and pesto.  The pizza came and was actually very good, the mozzarella was the fresh kind, not too much cheese, the sauce was a thick puree without being chunky. the toppings were very fresh, everything in sliced form, even the sausage. definitely need a fork and knife to eat this. supposedly it was a 12\" pizza, but being new york style it was very thin, and I was actually kind of surprised I finished the whole thing.  All in all not a bad restaurant, not a bad pizza and I would go back."}
{"text":"The Don was great. Service not so good. We needed to ask the waitress a question and instead of coming to the table, she was going to make me turn around backwards in my seat to talk to her. Just come to the table in front of me, stop for a brief few seconds. Once our pizza was delivered we didn't see her until she brought out our check.  In order to get a water refill I had to leave my table &  I waited at the bar until I got tired of waiting and then I just used the bar gun to get my own water. We were planning to get dessert but the waitress just brought out our check without asking if we wanted dessert or anything else. It's so sad to see how lazy wait staff are these days.  Especially how much we pay for food."}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's with a bunch of fellow employees the other night for the first time. The salads were amazing and huge! I am normally not a thin crust pizza type of person but this pizza was completely to die for! Quality ingredients and arrived to the table very promptly. The service was great and the place was very clean. I would recommend to anyone. We will be back in the future."}
{"text":"I can't believe we waited so long to try Grimaldi's!  The Red Sangria was delicious, the Mediterranean Salad was amazing, and the White Pizza with Ricotta, Pesto and Roma Tomatoes was incredible!  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"We love Grimaldi's!  One of the best pizzas around and the service has always been great too.  From time to time, I also enjoy a salad when here.  We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious! The pizza was amazing. We ordered the white pizza with mushrooms and sausage. We sat right next to the prep area and was cool to see them making our pizza and putting it inside the brick oven. Good service.  We are also fans of tropical iced tea and they had it here. Don't get the white sangria. It's not what you would expect."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I LOVE this place!!!!!!!  After reading all the wonderful reviews me and my friend Traci P have been wanting to try this place for a while and we finally did the other day.  Let me tell you there food is amazing, delicious, marvelous, wonderful...you get the point.  We were promptly greeted by our wonderful waitress Denise, she had asked if we had eaten here before and we said no so she explained how it work and how to order she was very informative which I loved. I ordered the personal size pesto pizza with meatballs. This by far is probably the best pizza Ive ever tasted in my life! The crust is hand tossed and whatever dough they use is scrumptious, they topped that with the delicious creamy pesto sauce and generous amount of mozzarella cheese and the out of this world meatballs! You can tell they use all fresh ingredients and good quality products. The whole pizza went together very well I couldn't stop eating I ate til I was sick that's how good this pizza was.   Even though I was stuffed from the wonderful pizza I had to order dessert I'm not only a sucker for desserts and have the worlds biggest sweet tooth but there homemade!!! I ordered a oreo cheese cake, this piece of heaven melted in my mouth it was creamy fluffy goodness.   I live less then 5 minutes from this restaurant and cant believe Ive been missing out on this place.  I cant wait to return here again, cant go wrong with great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"We really like it here! Pizza is good & I really like the Medi salad to make me feel better about eating all that bread! Educated Guess helps me wash it down!   your constant companion,  ~deirdra"}
{"text":"Just to be fair....my brother loves the pizza here, but my thoughts were that it could've been better & I've definitely had better. The service was slow & not very attentive."}
{"text":"NOT impressed with the Pizza.  They only serve thin crust.....and the extras will cost you a lot!   We ordered a 16 inch at $15.00 and did a 1/2 and 1/2.  All you get for the $15 is cheese.   Let's cut to the chase....To charge $14 extra dollars for toppings is outrageous !!!!  For an iced tea, small salad and a pizza.....it set us back $43.09.  Each side was charged as tho it was a full serving of the topping.....each side of the pizza was charged doubled for mushrooms and olives....and it was pretty skimpy.   So when I questioned the bill.....the waitress says.....that's just how we do it if you order a 1/2 and 1/2.  A little heads-up would have been great.  I can say it greatly affected her tip.   The service was good......salad would have been better (not so soggy) if she had put the dressing on the side as I asked.   This is 'average' pizza at best.......While I do not have a problem paying a premium for a killer pizza.....but this was not it.  Planning on another trip to the area in a few weeks.....and we will try someplace else.  I also informed the hotel to stop recommending this place."}
{"text":"Being from California I learned that Grimaldi's will never step into my state. Not because we are in the worse financial situation in recent history but because air quality laws prevent the use of coal burning brick ovens. That being said, I could not pass up an opportunity to taste the famous pizza from the Brooklyn Bridge. It was an impressive pie and everything you want from a New York style pizza -  slightly burnt crust, great cheese, fresh basil. So it was good and my 4 star rating reflects my expectations for a pizza epiphany. Perhaps the Grimaldis in New York is a 5 star pizza, different than this Nevada franchise. Until I go back there for the real deal Holyfield, I will have to put this pizza with any other New York style pizza I've ever had.  Oh, I hope to be back soon. It was definitely good."}
{"text":"ok, i used to work here - 4 years of my life. that said, my opinion is probably slightly different than the average review.   i ate there every day i worked there - which let me tell you, are definitely a lot of days. you'd think i'd get sick of the food...and i didnt. i tried pretty much every topping combination possible (except for the anchovies - no thank you.). so here are my suggestions/opinions:  one of the most important things to know, is that the more water your topping contains, the soggier your pizza will turn out - vegetable toppings obviously contain more water than meat toppings. so if you want a crisp pizza, keep that in mind when piling on the fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, and oven roasted sweet red peppers.  second, if youre really trying to compare scottsdale's patsy grimaldi's to brooklyn's patsy's...the two pizzas will never truly match up. given the location of the original, aesthetics are a huge part of the pizza experience - a part that scottsdale's version will never beat. however, scottsdale's patsy's goes to some great lengths to duplicate the pizza as best they can. the owners of the scottsdale patsy's even brought in a chemist to duplicate the brooklyn water through reverse-osmosis so the water used to make the dough is exactly the same in both locations. (everyone knows arizona water sucks.)  a few of my favorite combinations are: regular pizza (red sauce), oven roasted sweet red peppers, ricotta cheese, and pepperoni; white pizza (no sauce with garlic) extra basil and fresh tomatoes; pesto pizza with meatballs and onions. yumm..  as a server, there are a few questions/issues i feel the need to address if im going to give grimaldi's a proper review:  1.) dont come to grimaldi's for pizza around 4:00pm unless you want to wait for the kitchen staff to stoke the ovens (this takes approx. 45 min)  2.) yes, the antipasto doesnt have lettuce, so its not a traditional salad  3.) no, they dont have pineapple. no, they dont have bacon, or canadian bacon for that matter.   4.) yes, thats the full menu...and they do a damn good job of making everything on it."}
{"text":"Ordered a large white garlic pizza with pepperoni and meatballs which came with about 8 slices served beautifully by our waitress. I always have to eat my pizza with cola. The experience was great. I loved the fact that they serve your first slice and really make sure that you are enjoying your experience for first timers. We also had a very good appetizer which wasn't too filling. This location is very nice which includes a sports bar that's half outside and inside. Friendly service in a busy area. I loved the pizza there and wi be coming back for more. Great Pizza ftw."}
{"text":"Agree with previous author! The water really is everything.  If you cannot drink AZ tap water you cannot expect to make delicious food with it. Anyway being somewhat of a pizza snob this pizza is unbelievable and it's made in a rustic uncomplicated style with minimal ingredients allowing each one of them to shine.  With that said please allow me to add this, DO NOT EAT PIZZA WITH A KNIFE AND FORK!!! It looks ridiculous and for the diner the experience is altered.  I've been to all locations and San Tan is probably the best in terms of service and food quality.  In those areas they get 110%, the layout is also great. I think when they built this location, they did not anticipate such popularity as it fills up quickly and the wait-time can be lengthy (but worth it).  If you feel it is worth the drive you can probably be seated immediately in Chandler/Ocotillo as it is very large and pretty but lacks in the little things such as professional service and ambiance but if you're looking to get in and out, it is fine.  One more VERY important thing, they support essential non-profit organizations through charity events.  Last year they showed their support for the Gilbert Boys and Girls club by donating 100% of all sales from the event.  It turned out to be a huge and generous donation.  I will always support a business who believes in supporting others."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, decent size for a large one, but idk what all the hype is about since it was very much average in taste. I have definitely had better pizza very easily. Service was ok, but I took my pizza to go so I cannot say much about it. One major flaw: not enough cheese and each topping is at least $2 (but it is vegas, so no surprise about the pricing). Easily accessible is you are staying at the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Literally worst service from a manager I have ever had. We had a COCKROACH crawling on our table and up our friends body. When the manager finally came over to see what was wrong, he laughed and walked off. Never coming here again. So disappointed. None of us got to finish our meal and none of us took our dinner home."}
{"text":"One of the BEST pizza spots in Phoenix ! But make sure to check in ahead of time - and even then expect to wait at least a half hour . So worth the wait tho! Their salads are also amazing !"}
{"text":"The prices might be a little steep for pizzas, but the food was delicious and the customer service was truly outstanding.  We had a calzone, a house salad, and a caprese salad. We ordered the small calzone and it fed both my husband and I for lunch, and me for dinner- a lot of bang for our buck. The caprese salad was as good as any I've had, and my husband really liked his house salad (again, the small was actually pretty huge). But what really wowed us was the customer service. Everyone, from the host, to the server, to the manager, was friendly, courteous, and seemed to genuinely be interested in us and want our business. At the end, we had our food boxed, and they even threw in a piece of their Oreo cheesecake (absolutely outstanding, btw, and I work for a sister restaurant to the Cheesecake Factory) for free, just so we could try it. I've never had a restaurant to sincerely show that they want us to return- which we definitely will. Grimaldi's has totally won us over. I very much recommend them!"}
{"text":"My friend absolutely loves this place and first took me to the one in Henderson. At first I just thought it was ok but then I tried their white pizza. I was hooked and now that is a must order for me every time. This is very thin crust pizza cooked in a coal oven so it isn't what most people are used to and some may be disappointed if they are looking for more Chicago style pizza. I agree with the other posters that their non-pizza menu items are just ok, the salads are fairly plain and the desserts are just so-so but the pizza is fantastic. It could be a little cheaper but their price point is fair considering the portion size."}
{"text":"Great Pizza & Italian Food. Waiter was kind and attentive & the portions were very large.   Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Got there early, about 5:15, and checked in. Immediate seating outside in the patio which is a lovely place to sit. It's a bit sunny but give it about an hour and the sun goes down and it's just awesome.   Beers on tap are pretty good although the selection is a bit minimal, but I'm a beer snob. The small sized Caesar salad is perfect for two people. We have had the large size and end up bringing half of it home.   We had a large sized pepperoni and ricotta cheese pizza which, as always, was excellent.   Out server was a bit brisk but she has lots of tables and kept us happy and checked in on us with a smile. The hostesses were great too."}
{"text":"Grimaldi a pizza is my favorite so this review may be a bit biased. Try the meatballs on your pizza! It's the best. The service was good the last time I went and overall it wasn't a bad experience for a restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had in my life! It's perfect crust is crunchy, with tasty toppings and gooey cheese. I'm getting hungry just writing this review. Stop by and have dinner here because it is just amazing. The tiramisu was also a nice way to finish your meal! I wish they had these on the East Coast."}
{"text":"Go.  Don't think twice.  Pizza from New York.  Best I've ever had period.  That's all I can say. Go!"}
{"text":"We love Grimaldi's and go to the San Tan location fairly regularly. (It's the closest one to our Mesa home.) But I wish so much that we lived near this Ray Rd. location! Why? Because of their awesome weekday lunch menu! They offer a personal 6\" pizza for around $5, and the best deal of all: one 6\" pizza plus a salad and drink for $9.50. It's the perfect amount of food, and of course the service is typically pretty great as well. If the other valley Grimaldi's were smart, they would offer these lunch specials too."}
{"text":"This is still by far my favorite pizzeria! I absolutely love their margarita pizza! It's made to perfection! Crispy crust but cheesy at the same time ! Vegas got a lot of good eats and this is definitely one to hit ! I know the hours may not be as long as secret pizza but it is way better than that"}
{"text":"What can I say about Grimaldi's? I would say that this is by far my most favorite pizza place ever! I'm strictly sadden that the closes one to me is in another state. I will pay Grimaldi's a visit everytime I pay a visit to Sin City!   Julia S made our eating experience quite wonderful! She was very pleasant and so patient with us. Grimaldi's is so lucky to have someone like her working for them. I give her 5 stars!!  We ordered the Bruschetta w/ Chicken Pizza, We ordered a size small and it was perfect for my fiance and I. We are actually big eaters and suprisingly we were satisfied. It comes with oil and vinigar and we get to sprinkle how much we wanted on our pizza. It was so good.  My fiance wanted to take a picture of the chefs throw the pizza dough in the air and watch them spin it and everyone there were such great sports.   I recommend coming here. This is my must go to spot when I visit Vegas. And hopefully Julia will be working because I know I'll be asking for her.  Now I just hope they open one up in the San Francisco area. My fiance and I will be regular customers when that happens!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, and friendly service, really sucks they \"stoke the oven\" so much which makes it impossible to cook pizzas for about an hour.  On The last occasion which I'm updating my review about the pizza left much to be desired even by grimaldis standards, too much sauce, not enough cheese, and FLIES bugging us the whole time.  The service for the most part was good but they constantly got confused about whose order is who, I want to give them 4 stars but after multiple visits and can easily say something is always a little off when we're not being refused service because they're \"stoking the oven.\"  It makes me feel like they give themselves an excuse to slack off when they do that, they desperately need a new oven or maybe just a second oven, not to complicated to figure out if your a successful restaurant one would think."}
{"text":"Another amazing dinner!!  This place definitely doesn't disappoint.  Pesto pizza was delish, as was the traditional pepperoni.  Our server Claudia was great.  Made perfect pizza suggestions and my drink was never empty. Keep up the great work !!"}
{"text":"I think I might be a 5-star whore! But Grimaldi's definitely deserves it. Let me say that I was born in New York and have tasted the very finest in pizza offerings. I would put Grimaldi's up against any pizza joint in NY.   First the place. I have been to both the Old Town and DC Ranch locations. I like the Old Town one better. Not sure why, I just do. The restaurant is nice and has both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor is perfect for a day drink in the spring or evening dinner in the summer. Cool patio. Indoors is a little tight, but the tables all have the traditional red and white checkered table cloth. The brick-ovens are also open to the restaurant. Nice touch.   Food and bevy. There is a decent selection of beers, including Peroni. I am a beer snob and like to drink the beer from whatever region the food is from. I have had wine here, but not a big connoisseur so my opinion wouldn't be too reliable. I have always gotten the salad with a pizza. It is very simple so don't expect something with lots of ingredients. For me the salad takes me back to when I was a kid eating at my grandmother's. She always made a simple salad with oil and vinegar, tomatoes, onions, and maybe olives. Sprinkle some salt and done. It is good, get it.   The real reason why everyone goes is the pizza of course. Can't remember all of the combos of toppings I've had, but so far the best has been ricotta and sun-dried tomatoes. The ricotta was so creamy it was like having dessert. I love thin crust pizza that is crunchy on the bottom and crust, but soft under the cheese and sauce. Doesn't disappoint. Just a plain cheese pizza is sublime as well. The pepperoni is awesome too! They are smaller than the usually fare, but they cook it long enough so the sides curl up and get crunchy. My friend Z picks them off and gives them to his wife because she loves them so much.   I have been there once when someone has gotten dessert. Funny story. He got depressed when someone at the table told him they reminded him of a friend of theirs. When a pic was shown of this friend, it was some large man that looked nothing like my friend. So, he put his head in his hands and said he didn't want his cannoli anymore because his feelings were hurt. The person sitting next to me picked up his fork, got a piece of the cannoli on it and fed him. He instantly cheered up. Maybe you had to be there.   Anyway, go to Grimaldi's. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Palazzo and we were craving pizza so we decided to check this place out and ordered pizza to take back to our room.  We ordered a large pizza with ricotta cheese, olives, and chicken. The pizza was pretty good, mainly because I love thin crust and I love the taste of pizzas that are baked in coal fire bricked ovens. My only complaint would be that it took 54 minutes to get our pizza, because they messed up on our order... Luckily the pizza was good.. so it made up for it."}
{"text":"I've been there numerous times. They have one if the best pizzas in town. Their salads ate great too. This place is clean and kid friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  One of the best pizzas I have had.  Very light and crispy, perfect sauce, excellent toppings and wonderful servers.  They have a good wine list and very good salads as well.  I love the location of this spot in the Palazzo.  Not crowded which makes for a lovely dining experience."}
{"text":"A little pricey but its in Boca Park, so expected. Best brick oven pizza ever and for the quality DAMN the price!"}
{"text":"Only ever ordered to go but seriously some of the best pizza I've ever had! Always stick with simple large pepperoni and never disappoints. Their pepperoni isn't like store bought packaged stuff. It's super flavorful thicker slices of pepperoni. Sign up for their birthday club and you can grab a free pizza when you eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by saying that for the past decade, it has been very hard to find consistently good NY style pizza in Arizona.  For whatever reason the Chicago transplants started up restaurants to support their own but the New Yorkers were late to the game.  So having Grimaldis show up is a breath of fresh air and if I wasn't for that I'd give it 4 starts instead of 5. Because it's a chain.  If you are in AZ and want good brick oven NY style pizza then this is hands down the place to go to.  They only serve salad, calzones and pizza so don't come here for a romantic date.  On the flip side, it's not a dumpy hole in the wall it's a nice looking place with a modest decor and as a previous reviewer commented, they even serve Robert Mondavi for  us stuck up Scottsdale residents.  I have probably been there 20 times and each time the staff has been friendly, the service has been good and the food has been excellent."}
{"text":"The spinach salad is so delish! I love this place, everything is great about it... excellent wait staff, and everything on the menu is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service! Definitely need to go back again! I recommend The Don pizza and their cheesecake trio."}
{"text":"I had Grimaldi's on my list for a long time now. I love pizza and have been to most of the best Arizona has to offer. I was hoping Grimaldi's would be a new favorite, but not so fast..   The service was unimpressive - in fact it was pretty evident the waitress wasn't aware of the occasion we were celebrating, and only came back a few times so we were waiting, waiting, waiting to pay the bill. The restaurant was getting a little busier by the time we left, but it still wasn't a full house.   We should have asked for outdoor seating because the inside was so cold, my husband had to go out and get his jacket..   We ordered their Marghertia which in our opinion \"sucked\". It lacked the balance others have with the sauce/cheese/basil. The basil was muted, the cheese was understated and the sauce was overwhelming.. so much that it made the pizza little soggy at the center. Margherita is usually hands down my favorite, so this was disappointing.   Luckily, we also ordered the Brooklyn Bridge which was way better.. if I did for some reason come back this is all I would order.   I was hoping to find a nice salad to order to go with the meal, but nothing really stood out as being all that tempting.. in fact aside from the pizza nothing really grabbed me.   The waitress asked if we wanted one or two boxes to pack up our pizza, and since we had over half of each left we asked for two. What we got were two tiny boxes and the pizza stacked up on each other.. not quite what I had in mind because it made it very soggy for heating up at home. They may as well have thrown it in a bag.. how frustrating.   I'm not exactly dying to come back.. Arizona has way better pizza joints around."}
{"text":"A really nice pizza spot in Old Town Scottsdale. We came here on our last night in AZ. The area around this spot is just nice and clean. Lot's of places to go to and a nice downtown feel to the entire location. We didn't have to wait at all to be seated and our waitress was fantastic. We ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and half chicken and garlic. We also got a house salad I also ordered a glass of chardonnay (it paired well). The pizza was really good! I tried both types that we ordered and it tasted nice and fresh with a lot of taste in them. The place is fantastically well maintained and the water was good too. I even had room for dessert and I ended up ordering a cannoli. The cannoli was mouth watering fantastic. It was so good I wanted to order another one! Overall, fantastic spot with a good ambiance, service and food!"}
{"text":"obvious go to. We felt the need to visit this place only days after getting back from NYC. the original is under the brooklyn bridge and we never ventured that way. as good as it is here, i cant imagine how fantastic it is in nyc with the water. completely reminiscent of the nyc style pies we had only days before from Lombardi's and John's Pizzeria... the first pizzeria in NY and the other on our pizza tour, respectively.   Outstanding. If setting reservations, call before 4pm. only knock of the star is the price for the pie. It seemed priced the same as i'd expect of the nyc city location despite being in az. Even the pie's we had at John's and Lombardi's, in East village and Little Italy in Manhattan were priced more competitively then this."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! We went on a Tuesday night around 6:30 pm and the place was Busy! Got a table quickly though. It happened to be Half-price wine night so we shared a carafe of moscato to go with our pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The crust is thin and chewy, the excellent sauce had a slightly sweet taste, the mushrooms were fresh (Not canned!), the mini pepperoni slices were plentiful, and it was topped with slices of fresh mozzarella. Heaven! The reason for the 4-star rating is twofold. 1) there is No handicapped parking. There is a parking lot across the 2-lane street, but the spots closest to the restaurant are reserved for motorcycles! Motorcycles! We were shocked! And - 2) our waitress seemed more interested in a couple at another table that everyone who worked there seemed to know. Regulars maybe. She started out good - attentive, friendly, helpful. But seemed to lose interest in us. At one point, she took our pizza to wrap the leftovers, then stopped by the couples' table again - which took her And our pizza in the opposite direction of where she would go to package the leftovers. So not cool! Still would return and loved the food. Be aware - it's a busy, Noisy place. Not great for talking to your dinner companion."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place in Vegas and lucky for us it is just down the street.  We do take out or family night or date night here.  The crust is the best- I usually don't eat the crust but do here.   I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"No Vegas trip can start or be complete without a stop at Grimaldi's for lunch. Haven't been to the locations on the strip, but this one is only small 10 minute detour off the 15 right before you enter the last vegas strip. Great service, best NY pizza I've had, fresh cold beer- tastiest Sam Adams Boston Lager I can remember having anywhere."}
{"text":"Great customer service and even better Pizza !  the service we received from our server Christian was awesome !  very professional and ultimate service . Our pizza was not up to the manager's liking and he returned to our table to explain that he was remaking the pizzas , which was great as we certainly wanted a great tasting and freshly made pizza. when the pizza's came , to our surprise , the cheese was a blend of cheeses which has a different taste and some of which we can not eat.   The Manager came over and totally took charge.  He remade the pizza without hesitation and offered to buy the pizza rather than charging us for it .  now thats a great recovery and a professional move to retain us as as patrons !  Thank You Manager and Christian for a great experience at Grimaldi's Scottsdale Quarter today !   Respectfully ,  Mr. Lopez"}
{"text":"Since it is hubby's birthday in a few days he received his annual coupon for a free large pizza. I still am amazed that you receive an entire large pizza for your birthday. I think it is awesome as so many restaurants simply give you a free dessert and neither one of us are really big dessert eater's. So we started off with their seasonal Strawberry Salad and it was scrumptious. The small size was the perfect size for the two of us to share and the ratio of ingredients was spot on. For our pizza we ordered our traditional White pizza and added Roma tomatoes, sweet red peppers, and ricotta cheese. This combination is phenomenal, especially when sprinkled with balsamic vinegar on top. Service was top-notch (as always) and the food was outstanding again!"}
{"text":"Amazing tasting pizza. Had extra sauce and cheese which we paid extra for but still seemed a dry but great flavor. enjoyed the thin crust.  I would recommend them to anyone."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant for a  pizza parlor. Nice and spacious. Very clean and well decorated. This can be a real good casual first date spot.  They play nice and slow oldies, nothing  crazy like rap music. You can actually have a nice conversation during dinner without screaming. Portions are huge and price is extremely reasonable for everything you get. Service is very very good. Everyone is professional and courteous. must try dessert trio for 10 bucks. Really good."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous pizza place. I would say it compares to any I have ever been to. The food was fast and the bill surprisingly low."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's brings New York Pizza to Las Vegas.  This is a good spot for a relatively cheaper lunch while in Vegas.  There seem to be plenty of seating as well as a bar.  No outdoor seating however.   Started with the spinach salad to get our veggies.  Nothing out of the ordinary here, but it really hit the spot.  Just the right amount of onion.  The pizza is thin crust cooked in coal oven.  Crust was nicely browned.  The sauce was neutral and nice.  Mozzarella and mushrooms completed the process.  This pizza hit the spot!  Service was grand.  Nice spot for a quick bite in Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go here after church. We haven't been back for a while due to change in schedules but whenever we have a chance to dine at Grimaldi's we are always up for it. We love everything on the menu.  It's simple yet satisfying. They have good wine choices too.  What I love about their pizza is that it has very thin crust and taste delicious. Nice atmosphere too! Never had a bad server, which is great."}
{"text":"I tried there new BBQ chicken pizza. Not a fan.  But still love there Pepperoni.  It's Authentic slice of heaven.  And I will continue to tell everyone and there mom to go there. One of my favorite pizza places in town."}
{"text":"Love the food but not this location. Had an issue that management would not investigate even at the corporate level."}
{"text":"Recommended but far from impressed. We are Grimaldis faithful. Our visit the the Old Town Scottsdale location left us questioning everything about Grimaldis. Normally we eat at the North Scottsdale location. Knowing that all the restaurants are family owned and the fact that they brag about the fact that they have special only for Grimaldis flour and sauce & that they get fresh produce delivered daily, our pizza was pretty bland. The sauce had no flavor at all. NONE!  A can of ragu would have had zestier flavors.   I'm hoping we just happened to catch these guys on a bad day. Maybe???  Nonetheless, we will go back sometime again. We will have to try out this location one more time before striking it off our list. The DC Ranch location is our normal Grimaldis spot.   The Old Town location is great.  It's a block south of Indian School on N. Scottsdale Rd. They have a large indoor dining room with an open view of the guys tossing the dough in front of the big coal fired oven. If the weather is nice, treat yourself to the cute outdoor patio. They have several private party dining rooms at this location.   I love their flair for being an old school pizza parlor. The red and white checkered table clothes rock!  My kids got a huge kick out of their sinks with the built-in Dyson air dryer!  Cool dad. The kids love that they get a small piece of raw pizza dough to play with while awaiting our food to arrive.   Be sure to try their salads. They are really well put together and very tasty!"}
{"text":"YUM!!!!!  This was actually my 2nd time having their pizza, but the first time It was brought to me.  This time I went to DC Ranch Market Street to watch my friend's band Rock Lobster play.  We sat on the patio at Grimaldis so we could still watch the band.  Chandler, he was our server/bartender.  We had such good conversation with him.  He made us both feel like we were appreciated for being there and gave us the perfect amount of attention to make us feel special.  He was an amazing multi-tasker, he was able to hold up conversation with us, continuously pour drinks, enter orders in, give us amazing service, and get our food to us lightening fast even though they were slammed for the nights event.  This location is super far from my home, but because of Chandler, we would easily go back to this location when we want Grimaldis.  Now for the food... We got a small pepperoni, which is not small.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the pizza come out.  I was thinking personal pan pizza size for 9$.  NOPE it was the size of what I would think was a medium.  Grimaldis uses some of the most amazing and fresh tomato sauce that just explodes with flavor.  Their cheese tastes like it was made in their kitchen from scratch.  The little pepperonis are so think and full of intense flavor.  I savored the pizza with every bite.  I am a pizza lover and they get an A+ for sure.  I can't wait to go back and I recommend everyone check it out... really soon!"}
{"text":"Service is goodish Pizza was absolute trash Extremely soggy, and dripping water Everything slid off the pizza  And fucking hell, have you ever heard of salt or seasoning?"}
{"text":"We got the Don add bacon and black olives with a Caesar salad. It was delicious!! Like another reviewer said the crust is amazing and the perfect combo of crispy and chewy. The pizza cake out pretty quickly too. Pricing was fair. Service was amazing! The atmosphere was nice too!  We were able to watch the end of an NBA game while we waited on the bar TVs. The server was so sweet to our almost 2 year old who was way over being strapped in her high chair as we had just driven for 2 days to get to Vegas.  Our waitress brought pizza dough for her to play with which was a lot of fun!  The bathrooms were nice and clean too!  Definitely a recommendation for anyone in Vegas wanting phenomenal pizza!"}
{"text":"My 2nd favorite:  grilled chicken, sundried tomato, basil, and garlic.  The pizza was fantastic as always, but the toppings ($10+) seem a little pricey.  I guess it's true:  you pay for what you get :)  Delicious.  One can only dream about Grimaldi's opening in LA one day...."}
{"text":"I have herd great things about Grimaldi's and finally got a chance to try it. The server and staff were very friendly and polite they did a wonderful job. The white pizza was delicious, the pepperoni and mushroom pizza was not so great. The crust ended up all mushy from the grease on the pepperoni pizza which i cant stand. On the other hand the white pizza was perfect!     Grimaldi's has a nice dining room with a large opening in the building for fresh air and sunlight. The only down side to having this large opening, it lets in the flys. I had to swat away flys from our food several times during our meal which put a bit of a damper on the whole meal. Aside from the mushy crust on one pizza and the flys, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"WON'T EVER GO HERE AGAIN. Twice my wife and I went to eat here and we were seated and forgotten about. First time was seriously irritating, second time we got up and left after 8 minutes. Went across the street and ate BJ's then brought my receipt back and showed the manager were I spent my money that night. He was very apologetic and brought me I'm and gave us a gift certificate for a free meal for 2. We loved their pizza so after a few weeks we decided to try it again. Once again terrible slow service. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm with others. I don't get why people think this place is so good. I don't think the pizza tastes like real NYC pizza or good pizza in general. The crust is so crispy to the point of being burnt, not impressive. We ordered 4-5 flavors and the topping selection was good, but I just wasn't blown away. I love pizza and try lots of different places, but despite the hype this place doesn't rank very high among the other places I've tried.  I will say the place is cute and well laid out. It was hard to find but spacious and easy to accommodate a large group."}
{"text":"I give up.  This joint smells great from the street but The pizza tastes like shit. The waiter must have been having a sales contest as he kept pushing a 60 dollar bottle of wine.....to wash down this swill?  The red sauce has no flavor. The garlic will leave you reeking for hours. The salads are ok, nothing special. I guess, if you have kids and need to eat this is alright but not a destination by any stretch."}
{"text":"For the third time in three weeks I was told the ovens were being stoked. No pizza for an hour. This is crazy. Why don't they have two ovens. Hundreds of people were walking around looking for a bite to eat. The hostess told us the oven would be stoked in30 minutes. We sat down and ordered. When we questioned our server he said a minimum of one hour.  We never would have agreed to waiting an hour. Wake up hostess. ...bummer all around. Hey patsy, there are 5 movie theatres that let out at about 3-4 daily. If you want to make more dough buy another oven."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Always fresh. Perfect for our family Friday pizza movie night. Managers are fantastic. Our favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"Best thin crust Brooklyn pizza, bestus Calzone I ever had! I recommend this place to everyone, especially if you like a great salad & pizza"}
{"text":"My boyfriend had some sort of birthday coupon for this place, and we wanted pizza, so we tried it out. So delicious! We didn't finish the pizza, so we brought some home for the roommates. I think we got a custom pizza, but there are both traditional and non-traditional choices if you don't like to make stuff up. Also - try the blueberry cheesecake - so delicious and worth the calories! There's a nice patio for when the weather is nice, and you can people watch - always a bonus!"}
{"text":"We visited our friends in Goodyear and I was kind of psyched to revisit Taste of Italy 2 where we had pizza the last time. Our local friends wanted to take us to Grimaldi's instead, their favorite pizzeria about 20 minutes away. Being the Yelpcurious sort, I was game to try this much hyped place. The downside to a place that has been hyped is that one's expectations are higher.   We ordered:  * Mediterranean Salad - Tasted fresh and good, but the dressing wasn't very balanced. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=ARQro-dR-8Hd90yb1yUyAQ * Pizza half plain cheese, half with basil and tomatoes http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=SbHD7fVvL32LgaUIpCBq9Q * Pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and basil http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=wl7YMUaOquTxdYgR4SG6Hg * Louis Martini Cabernet - for our friend * Red Sangria - for our friend  Positives:  + I'm all about the thin crust. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=qf12YBWeKcLe2leFp09fPA + The sauce has a nice kick to it. + The fresh mozzarella tasted good. In fact, everything was very fresh. + They give kids pizza dough to play with while waiting for the food - fun! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/93FNDjCBsdbKkUoh3UVS4g?select=9ZRm5qrrVJIQDnohj1llDA  Negatives:  - There was a 45 minute wait - the price of popularity. - The service had chain feel to it that didn't rub me the right way. \"I'm (server's name), and I'm going to take care of you.\" It was friendly enough, but wasn't for me. - My friend's pizza didn't have enough basil, and she asked for more. Our server said she could bring more for $2. That was disappointing for a tiny dish of chopped basil, considering it was already a topping and our $75 bill.  Overall, I enjoyed the pizza and the kid-friendly atmosphere. It wasn't the best ever, but I'm a fan."}
{"text":"First time here. Loved the oven roasted pizza. Didn't care for the house salad too much, kind of bland. Other than that, all good including the summer sangria!"}
{"text":"This thin crust pizza reminds me of back home in Philly. The sauce is perfect. We add additional sauce to our pie to mimic our taste in pizza."}
{"text":"I enjoy thin crust pizza with fresh cheese and tasty sauce. This Pie has not disappointed me. It reminds me of back home in Philly. Good Job!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's was initially not part of my itinerary during my last Vegas trip but since I was at the Palazzo Shoppes at around lunch, I unexpectedly found the spot and decided to give it a try.  I've heard a great deal about Grimaldi's from Travel Channel and Food Network so I figured it would be worth a try.  By my waiter's recommendation, I ordered my personal sized pizza with Pepperoni, Sausage, and Mushrooms.  And here's my work of art: http://bit.ly/115EmrX It's gonna sound very cliche but here it goes:  This was one damn good pizza!  Probably one of the best I've ever eaten!  From the moment my waiter brought it to my table, I seriously got giddy.  The aroma coming from the fresh cut meats and cheese was very amazing!  The crust, while crispy, still had a nice soft chew to it and had a nice rustic flavor to it.  But we all know in the end it's all about the toppings.  You can tell by the pic that everything was cut fresh and handmade.  And when I took that first bite, I was in pizza bliss =)  Very delicious!!  It was really handcrafted with a lot of love.  I'm glad that I decided to deviate from my itinerary and stop over to Grimaldi's.  Now I understand what all the hype was all about!  One of the best pizzas ever!  I'm definitely coming back again for another delicious pizza pie!  Fuhgeddaboudit!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good.  The calzones are huge.  But the sauce is a bit tangy.  it reminds me of jarred tomato sauce where it is sweetened with high fructose corn syrup.  Now I am not saying that their sauce is sweetened with corn syrup, but it certainly tastes like it.  Usually pizza sauce, that isn't over cooked or sweetened, tastes like a juicy tomato with salt and other spices...it should NOT taste like ketchup (which is accepted to have sugar added to it.)   All ketchup has sugar in it - that is what makes it ketchup!  But when a pizza sauce has that tangy/sweet flavor it tells me that it is inferior.  The food needs a new sauce...if they did that - it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Yup, I am that typical American who loooves pizza and this place has got it going on. Located in the desirably fashionable Scottsdale, this is a pizza oasis for those of us to engorge on an American staple. As with any good pizza joint, there's always something unique that makes them stand out. I really enjoy a good brick-oven pizza but with amazingly fresh toppings and good sauce (it's allll about the sauce), this truly stood out as one of my best pizza experiences.   After an afternoon of shopping and the much need for a refuel on the belly, my friend and I stopped here for dinner. The decor is industrial with sharp lines yet has a comfy feel about it because it's in a nice open building and you can see them make 'n bake your pizza. Since we were starved we ordered the antipasto salad as an appetizer. It was a platter containing olives, salami, fresh mozzerella, tomoatoes, served alongside with some bread. A comforting dish that was elegant in display and hit the spot but not too much.   We went with the standard red sauce pizza and ordered ours with pepperoni, garlic, and basil...a personal favorite of mine. We even had the option to add the basil before or after the pizza was done. I liked that option, it makes it more unique to what you want as opposed to this is what the restaurant does. The sauce was absolutely delicious and full of flavor. It ranks in my top 5 pizzas of all time.   I definitely would recommend this place to anyone visiting or who lives in this area. Being a visitor, I was definitely impressed with the quality of food and service. If and when I ever come back to Phoenix, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Ive been here twice and both times I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. The service is excellent (my first time both our server and waiter offered to explain the menu fully) and the interior/decor is welcoming with a very neat style. Most importantly the food is terrific, the ricotta is nice and creamy and the pizza crust is a perfectly cooked thin crust. I've had a spinach and mushroom calzone as well as a white pizza with spinach, mushrooms, and Roma tomatoes and loved both. Also, despite not being a big fan of cheesecake, I tried a little of their strawberry cheesecake and it was quite tasty.   Grimaldis's is definitely a place that I recommend."}
{"text":"Went to Fashion Show Mall to shop for a daughter's birthday. My wife and I had been wanting to go to Grimaldi's so we gave them a try just after they opened at 11:00am.  She had a calzone, and was so full afterwards, she wanted a nap.  I ate a small personal size pizza, with pepperoni, sausage, green pepper and onions. The meal was great but the crust was a  little thin for my tastes.  The atmosphere was great. A quiet, almost calming place. One of the first songs was \"Hello Dolly\" by Louis Armstrong. Very nice change of pace.   The service was pretty standard.  Bottom line, if your shopping at the Fashion Show Mall, and want a bite to eat for lunch. I would like to hignly suggest giving Grimaldi's a try."}
{"text":"I have to start with a disclaimer: I am not a thin crust pizza kind of a guy, but Grimaldi's is doing a dang good job of making a convert out of me.   The crust is fantastic -- it's not that cheap crunchy garbage you get at the wanna-be NY pizzerias, this stuff is legit. It's thin, but somehow manages to maintain a soft, chewy texture that perfectly compliments their fresh ingredients and phenomenal cheeses.   They say the secret to the crust is in the water... which is why they hired a chemist to recreate NYC tap water for the Las Vegas stores. It sounds nuts... but it worked, so I'm not complaining.   The ambiance is great, very urban and trendy (according to my wife, I don't pay attention... I'm there for the food). It's nice enough to not feel tacky taking a date there, but casual enough that you can wander in whenever and pull up a chair at the bar to watch the game. We enjoyed watching the chefs toss the dough and laugh when the new guy struggled with it.   I've been to both the Eastern and Boca Locations and both are similarly excellent. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Normally I am not a pizza fan, which makes it hard when you date someone who loves pizza.  However, I will never turn down coming here! Pizza is always so good, I can't stop eating it. I love that they have pesto pizza, so nom! For awhile we were going once a week!  A lot of the time we get Joelle, she is a super friendly server. Another time a server remembered our exact order even though he only served us one time before a month prior! Amazing! One time though, we got a different server, and I am not kidding when I say she was on drugs, so I guess you could say service is hit or miss. I have also tried every salad and they're also very good.  Sangria is amazing there as well. They also said i could bring my fur baby on the patio, haven't done it yet, but thats a big plus in my eyes!"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Grimaldi's and everything about this place is absolutely outstanding! We ordered the Margherita pizza and it has to be one of the best I've tried in Vegas so far. The service, I have to say, was phenomenal. I don't remember our server's name but she was awesome for recommending popular items, having great social skills, being quick and attentive as well as being patient. Omg and the Oreo cheesecake was yummy! If you haven't checked this place out, you're completely missing out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here. From Ohio, pizza is diffrent then we have at home but still was very good. Thin crust with good flavor. Came for lunch but the small size of restaurant would be crowded at dinner. Must try if you like wood fired pizza they us coal but cooks the same. Service was good and friendly. Tried garlic bread with cheese was also good."}
{"text":"Went there about 3 times but the last time we went seemed like they are cutting back on hoppings. We ordered mushrooms, onions abs garlic. Barely any mushrooms were on the pizza, the garlic was MINCED. So basically it was an onion pizza with barely any sauce also. I can see why they charge for extra sauce."}
{"text":"I almost wet my pants with excitement after six days of stringent dieting... when finally my prescribed 'binge and eat whatever the heck you want' day came upon me. What better way to splurge on calorific goodness than with a thin crust NY style pizza!  A nice pizzeria... which, although lacking in that authentic original hole-in-the-wall Grimaldi ambience... is well worth a visit. The calzone was marvellous, as was the custom margarita with extra sauce and fresh tomatoes. Being all authentic and such... no chillies or hot sauce. Salivating already at the prospect of returning to this shrine of thin crustiness!"}
{"text":"Unpopular opinion:  I'm a big fan of New York pizza but this pizza was unimpressive. We got a 16 inch white garlic pizza with artichoke, chicken, tomato, and red peppers. It was bland. The artichoke was good though. And the crust was so thin that it got soggy. The pizza bent and all the toppings fell off. I expected more from a $28 pizza from a sit down restaurant. It was mediocre.  But the spinach salad was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing.  Some of the best pizza I have ever had.  Very different from Neapolitan style pizza like Novecento across the street and Settebello near Green Valley Ranch, both of which are excellent.  I would say that those are more traditional Italian style pizzas and this is more Americanized, sliced, lots of topping choices, but not at all greasy like chain pizza.  Just great flavor, great atmosphere, great service.  A little pricey, but I would pay for it once a week when craving pizza, so it must not be too much of a deterrent."}
{"text":"I used to live about a fifteen minute walk away from the famous Grimaldi's in Brooklyn Heights. It was a little bit of a tourist trap, because everyone knew about it thanks to TV shows, magazines and the \"Best Pizza In America\" award. I went 1 for 5 in my attempts to get in that line down under the Brooklyn Bridge, and the one time I did manage to make it early enough to secure a decent spot, the za was definitely worth the 40 minute wait.   With that in mind, I was pretty intrigued by the prospect of a Grimaldi's pizza without the 2 hour line at the original location. I think, however, that there are forces at work to keep me and a Grimaldi's pizza apart and they have followed me to Phoenix.  This place is f*cking hard to find without a GPS. It's hidden in a shopping plaza across from a movie theater with some of the most understated signage ever.  The service was pleasant enough, and attentive. The antipasti and drinks came to the table right away and I hoped within 15-20 mins our pizza would follow.  20 mins pass. 25. Then 30, then 35. Where the hell is the 'za? People who were seated after I was are being served tasty looking pizzas and I got nothin'.   I noticed that Honey Boo-Boo's family, who were seated a couple tables away from me about ten minutes after I arrived were enjoying a pie that was identical to what I ordered. Shortly after they begin devouring that first pizza, they are presented with another pizza, which is followed by some discussion with their server and what seems to be some sort of apology. As if they had been given the wrong pizza and had begun eating it anyhow.   Yeah, they were eating my pizza. The server had goofed something up, and within 2 minutes brought a pizza to my table that was not at all what I had ordered as if she had a clue.   I asked for my check. The server told me the manager was coming to my table but no one ever showed.  She boxed the pizza up for me (it was mushroom, onion and tomato, not pepperoni as I had ordered, and I'm sorry, but I think putting tomato slices on a pizza that already has tomato sauce is dumb and I am not down to become a vegetarian because you botched my order) and I never did receive a check for it but I did tip her what would have been 20% of the bill.  Poor handling of my case leads me to believe they're all new and learning how to work together, but I can't see coming back to this particular location. Maybe I'll try Scottsdale instead or go to Barro's.  BTW- when it comes to pizza in Brooklyn, it's Carmine's or Lucali hands down over Grimaldi's anyhow."}
{"text":"absolutely the best in town with great customer service by staff and check backs by the manager. if you didnt sign up on their web site, do it now. you will be rewarded with a free large one topping pizza on your birthday week.. \"your birthday, not all your dogs birthdays. this is the best of the stores in the phoenix area. i live in ahwatukee and, although la poloma shopping center location on ray and I-10 is closer, still feel this original location is the best. and it was highly recommended by jerry orbach of \"law and order\"."}
{"text":"Ordered: - 16\" white pizza with spinach, mushrooms and spicy chicken sausage  Review: I am so glad that my boyfriend and I tried this place. It was recommended to me by my coworkers and I thought it was just another build-your-own Blaze pizza type of place. The pizza was fresh, thin, and delicious. I like my pizza crispy, which was what made me like this place a little more than secret pizza.  Overall: There was no wait. Great food and atmosphere. Waiter was very nice. Leftover pizza still tastes as great  4.3/5"}
{"text":"Our family ordered 2 pizzas and 1 large personal salad. The large salad--ment for 1 person--actually served a family of 6. Wow! 2 pizzas and a salad filled a starving family! Great service. The servers were very pleasant. Pizaa toppings were delicious!"}
{"text":"Eh, I guess I don't have anything negative to say, however they didn't excite me. Pizza was bland and just \"ok\" definitely nothing special was good, I wouldn't complain there- however the food was really just eh. I would not make an effort to come back. Not when there are so many other amazing pizza places out here."}
{"text":"Expensive and a total burn. I ordered a large 5 topping pizza look at my pic and you will see what I got. A total burn the server avoided us at all costs the wife was tired I was done so we payed our bill and left thought my picture would say it all. We got a 10 dollar Bowl of lettuce, 2 drinks, and the 5 topping pizza bill was 60 dollars guess the casino is not the only place you get screwed"}
{"text":"Love this location - it's in an outdoor shopping area. So if there is a wait to be seated, you can stroll around the shops or stand by outdoor fireplaces. When I went here with my family this weekend, the restaurant estimated an hour wait, so we stood outside by the fireplaces. Grimaldi's even offered to text us when our table was ready, so we were free to stroll around outside without fear of losing our table.  Love the pizza! So delicious. Great cheese and sauce. Even though I'm not usually a huge fan of thin crust, this pizza makes up for it in great taste. You pay for each topping, so we've always stuck to about one or two toppings. One large pizza feeds two people (with maybe one or two pieces to take home as leftovers). Just tried the pepperoni topping for the first time, loved it! They are little bite-sized, thicker slices than your normal pepperoni. I usually get sliced roma tomatoes and sausage..yum!  Also love the experience of just being here. While you wait for your pizza you can sit and watch the chefs twirl the pizza dough. Charming decor of wine bottle light fixtures and checkered table clothes.  I've always had friendly servers the 4 or 5 times I've been here. Also I would recommend everyone to sign up for their email newsletters! You get a free large pizza on your birthday! SO worth it!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, good selection of beers. When it is nice outside they open up the patio and it is something that you should go out and eat on. 4 TV's that are in the bar area but you can also see them through the restaurant. Prices are reasonable, a good place to get some pizza"}
{"text":"Where should I start!?!   This place is pretty simple... Drinks...Salads...PIZZAS...Desserts!   The pizza here is just amazing! The crust is delicious...thin with a great crunchy crisp texture to it. A regular pie is enough for two people to share but delicious enough for a little Asian to force down happily.   Their salads are pretty great as well. Portions are very generous and the presentation is pleasing.   Price wise...a bit pricey for pizza, (especially if you are a person who likes to add a lot of toppings onto your pizza) but you'll be getting a quality pie.   Save room for dessert! Tiramisu get's a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Freekin awesome!!! We had the large pepperoni and a Erin and I shared a small Caesar salad. Completely satisfying, not too greasy like some New York style pizza. We will be back."}
{"text":"Our family always comes here and we never had a problem. This pizza is great, but after the service we received tonight grimaldi's lost our service. We came here in hopes of celebrating two birthdays. We came ready to eat and hoped it would be as good as every other time. We ordered and thought everyone's order was in, come to find out that's not what happen. When we notified our waiter of this we were told it was never put in and that it would be pushed to the front of the line. So we waited, waited, and waited. I counted 10 pizzas go out. For being told our order was pushed to the front of the line, then to wait 30 more minutes. By the time we got it, everyone was done eating for about 15 minutes. We were upset and not once did the manager come and try to reassure us that we were being taken care of. Good food, but terrible service."}
{"text":"Pizza was lacking the spices, flavor I need in a pizza. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Ricotta, tomatoes and ham? I was expecting some quality ingredients like cherry tomatoes and even pineapple. But the tomatoes were almost white and pizza just fell short.   Sangria wasn't my favorite. And they don't have ranch! Ugh!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come near Tempe, I always have to stop at Grimaldi's. Their pie is really THAT good. Their pizza is thin crust and the coal oven gives makes it crispy... if thats what you're into. The pizza is really good and worth a try.   *On a side note, the restaurant looks more upscale than your typical pizza place- and as such, I think you are paying for the ambiance. Don't go expecting a take out place, or bar style. They have table cloths and the waiters have those aprons that hang down to their ankles. Still good pizza all around."}
{"text":"This place is nice,  people are really nice and friendly. Our waiter had great customer service and made sure we were taken care of. Menu has only a few selections and pizza was ok for us. We are not fans of thin crust pizza but it was ok. Overall is a nice restaurant with friendly staff."}
{"text":"Our family went here on Saturday May 19th after my son's Pre-K graduation. We ordered a large spinach salad, traditional pizza, and white pizza with garlic. It was a good location at the Scottsdale Quarters. When we arrived, it wasn't too busy. We walked in, there was a couple ahead of us that the hostess was taking to their seats. The hostess then came to us and ask \"Can I help you?\" We were kinda taken back since we were expecting the question \"For how many?\" So my husband got offended and told her \"Yeah, we want a seat of course.\"  Okay, fast forward to the food...The spinach salad was delicious but was overloaded with gorgonzola cheese. The traditional pizza was for our boys and they liked it but to me it was just okay. The white pizza with garlic though was really really good. We added meatballs on half of the pizza and sun dried tomatoes on the other half. There's just something about the white pizza with garlic that made me hear angels sing! We didn't care much for desserts.   Just a reminder, you will only find pizzas and calzones here. There no pasta, steak, seafood, or bbq in this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. It took some time to come out, but the place was busy. You could see the oven from the table and it was never not popping out pizzas. We liked it so much that we will be going back to get some more."}
{"text":"Meatball pizza with ricotta and fresh basil on top after cooked. YUMMO! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came on a whim after our other beloved pizza place was under renovations. Our server was prompt and polite. Our pizza was delicious. We spent the same amount of money we usually do on a Friday night out. (2 drinks ea., salad & pizza.) I'm not sure what the other reviewers expect unless they usually go to Peter Piper. Great, lively atmosphere. Good food, good wine, good service. We'll be back. Note to manager:  Pointing the way to the ladies room is just fine. If I was 8, I may need to be walked there."}
{"text":"Exceptional italian food! Not to memtion it was my birthday and they gave me a free large pizza. It was delicious! I also had their greek salad and they do not skimp on the cheese, olives, red onion and dressing. They have a large selection of wines and other beverages. Whatever your taste buds desire they have it. Don't forget to check them out during happy hour $2.00 off glasses of wine and appetizer specials."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for lunch today. We received a lukewarm (I'll be with you guys in a minute) greeting from a server. Same server took us to our table, piss poor attitude. Our actual server provided the same lukewarm greeting. Note to restaurants: TRAIN your servers to not address guests as \"You Guys,\" especially when one of the guests is a lady. We ordered a pizza with tomatoes, mushrooms and sausage (sausage only on half). They messed up our first pizza and brought us out another. This restaurant is nothing like the namesake in Brooklyn. Decent food, bad service. I will not be going back here or any other Grimaldi's except the original in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"So nice to have such good service and great food with a smile.  Hats off to Monique for showing our Cali visitors that we have great pizza in Scottsdale. And for turning a grumpy husband into a happy guy !!   Keep working on getting pineapple as a menu item.   Great pizza and salads !"}
{"text":"More charming than expected.  After seeing their pizza prices (externally) I felt queasy about the potential value proposition. I mean, the large pizza is ~16 bucks and toppings start at another $2 and a lot are $4. There's no thick crust here and thin crust pizza doesn't go as far. I was a little scared, however someone else offered to pay and the best kind of overpriced pizza is the kind you don't pay for, so why not?  Firstly they offered my toddler pizza dough to play with. This is a surprisingly good and original call. Kept him distracted for like five minutes, which of course is equivalent to a normal human year in toddler attention span. The beer list is solid with several choices from Deschutes. Also they serve their Sam Adams in the perfect Pint glasses which is really impressive.   The salads are solid. No doubt about that and reasonably priced as well. The Pizza is extremely spectacular and seems authentic. I stopped thinking of it as overpriced. Then they informed me that didn't have ranch. What the eff country do they think they're in? Anyways... We got three people out of there eating well and drinking well (except for the Toddler, he's trying to cut down on his alcohol) for $51 bones. Not terrible at all.  There's a friendly charm to the place; there were lots of families, lots of bright happy windows and a neat outdoor seating area. Also many people inside were unusually good looking both from the staff and the clientele. One of the waitresses looks like what Megan Fox would look like if she was a pizza waitress. Same expression too. If they give a discount to good looking people I didn't get one, sadly. However good for them for keeping up their standards.  Will return: most likely to drink beer on the patio, but at least during the day to enjoy the glorious sunshine the place gets."}
{"text":"Pesto-mozza-garlic-erroni.  Highly recommend it.  For a couple bucks more, you can order the large (it might be called family size or something) and receive lots more delicious.  The pizza was...  delicious.  We expressed our desire for extra garlic, but our server thought we might be overwhelmed.  Ordinarily, I lean heavily on my server for suggestions and such, but garlic to me is something of what I might imagine meth is to other valley residents.  I just can't get enough.  So, though I was \"rescued\" from my own addictions, the pizza was absolutely delicious, especially eaten with an additional side of pesto.  Our server also brought us a side of red sauce (miscommunication), which was really, um, nothing to write home about.    We started with the antipasto salad, which wasn't a salad, and was actually just a plate with the various antipasto accouterments and no lettuce or anything.  This may very well be some kind of attempt at traditionalism, but frankly, I wanted a salad.    The Chianti recommended to us by our server was delicious.  He said it was fuller than what we had originally picked, and I like my red wine to sort of slap me across the face.  Overall, delicious.  No food coma, no grease regret.  I attribute that to the freshness of the ingredients, and the focus on delicious.  Molto bene."}
{"text":"After not being able to get a table in glendale, we accidentally stumbled upon the spot in Tempe. Our server was very personable and professional.  The salad & pizza were both great. Atmosphere was very intimate,  overall a fantastic time."}
{"text":"While the entire team is fantastic, our server, Emily, made todays visit great. We came in for our sons' birthday and it was very enjoyable. The food is always fresh and delicious. This was our third visit (first at this location) and we'll be back. Thank you."}
{"text":"The service was so-so.  There was also a hair found in my salad, but they replaced it right away.  They also took it off the bill.  The food is pretty good though plus hairs give food fiber.  I'm just kidding, but our group had three different types of large pizzas.  They were all nice, thin, and prepared very well in their brick oven.  The desserts were also really good.  The cannoli's and tiramisu prepared very well.  The prices are a bit on the steeper side for pizza.   Each topping was a minimum of $2 more.   So yeah, some cost even more than $2.  Nonetheless, the food was still good.  It's a nice place to go once in a while."}
{"text":"This place is a good place to go if you're staying at the Palazzo. The service is nice, nice atmosphere and reasonably priced for such generous portions."}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times and experienced a little longer wait for someone to even acknowledge us this time. Had a small Caesar salad and a large pizza to split for two people, salad was very good and the pizza was good! We do enjoy thin crust pizza and that is what they serve here.  The one thing we noticed that we were not too fond of is that they use raw sausage and handle all other pizza toppings with no gloves after handling raw meat.   Overall a good experience, we will come back but won't order the sausage!"}
{"text":"As close to Lombardi's (NYC) or Pepe's (CT) as you'll get here in AZ. All locations here are good (the one in Tucson is smaller and the wait is usually relatively short). Excellent quality, flavor and staff. They know what made Lombardi's and Pepe's successful and they've draw on that.  Yummmmn"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed! My pizza came out COLD, waiter never checked on us so I flagged down the manager who offered to make us  another pizza. I'm literally sitting watching the guy making pizzas throw my pizza together with a shitty attitude and slamming down the silver lid where the toppings are kept.  The manager was nice enough take both pizzas off the bill.  The manager and our waiter are the only reasons why they are getting 2 stars for doing the right thing.   I'm from NEW YORK,  and this isn't New York pizza even if they have locations there."}
{"text":"Great brick oven pizza. Also the appetizers, I recommend the anti pasta. Great desserts too.  Service is great and the price is normally what you'd pay for pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the business.... Never been disappointed or had a bad experience always coming here for pizza fix. When family and friends come into town always take them here"}
{"text":"Had a house salad, 16 pepperoni, sausage with extra sauce. All great. They charge for extra sauce which I do not like. But pizza is AWESOME and salad great"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I went to this locations. Once again, they mess up my pizza. EVERY time I order a white with garlic I add pepperoni and pizza sauce. Why is it, at this location only, do they out the sauce on top of the cheese? Then the guy wants to argue that's how Grimaldis does it. Well guess what, it's not it's only these people at this location who have no clue what they are doing. I have been to every Vegas location and the original in NYC. I am not stupid like he thinks. What a soggy mess, threw it in the trash. Waste of time and money. The manager was rude and has no service skills. I recommend you drive further to the strip or Henderson to get real service and pizza."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by Grimaldi's in the slightest, and I am a very forgiving and understanding customer.  The girl who served us seemed like she was ready to go home. She took our order, someone else brought the meal, and she checked on us once. Then my drink ran out and I found a bug in my food. So I'm peering around trying to get her attention unaware that she had already left and our server had changed. I suppose she forgot to mention that if we needed anything, we should ask someone else.  Moving on to the bug. I've worked at restaurants and know that these things happen.  Wouldn't have even caused a slight deduction if it were handled the way it should have been. I very quietly brought it to the attention of one of the hosts (since I couldn't find the disappearing waitress) The bartender seemed genuinely sorry. I couldn't eat the pizza anymore because all the spices looked like a butt of the fruitfly that I had just dug out of cheese pizza with my finger*ugh* The manager insisted the bug got there after he gave it to me and he \"knew\" that it wasn't baked in. He comped the pizza and took it away. I ordered a canoli since I was still hungry but really grossed out, and we each got a coffee with liqueur.   So we spent 30 dollars on a ruined dinner. We ordered our sodas to go with the pizza, we ordered the canoli to replace the pizza that I was starving for and didn't get to eat. I know how a good restaurant works, and A. you do not tell the customer that she was wrong and she did not just dig a bug from INSIDE of her food and B. You don't charge her for her drinks and replacement food (especially when it's a 4$ canoli). You charge for the booze if there was any (and there was)  So I'm home, an hour of my day is gone, and I'm still hungry. What I had of the food was good but I would eat dominos before paying for service that I don't receive."}
{"text":"I don't know what type of pizza this is NY, Authentic Italian etc. but my god was it good! Everything tasted so fresh! Fresh sauce, mozzarella, crust. Had the large Margarita pizza, small antipasto salad. The small salad was perfect for 2 & ended up bringing at least 1/2 the pizza home. So many great options for num-nums in Vegas, but this one so far is the best pizza I've tried & fairly priced! Large pizza, antipasto app. 2 cocktails & (split) dessert for $48 plus leftovers tomorrow! What are you waiting for gavone?!"}
{"text":"Great Dinner at Grimaldi's Jamie and Austin  T were awesome! Austin T needs to be a server ASAP! So personable.. fun.. and gave us the inside scoop on table 52!! Thanks for a great dinner"}
{"text":"Great environment, great pizza with thin crust and homestyle pizza sauce. It can be crowded at times, so it's best to make a reservation in advance especially on weekends. We love their margherita, it's simply one of the best pizzas I've had! We totally recommend Grimaldi's to pizza lovers."}
{"text":"Just returned from a trip to Palazzo in Vegas, so decided to try the newest Grimaldi's.The food is delicious, consistent, and large portions, even when ordering the small sizes. My husband is crazy about Grimaldi's, and was impressed by this location. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because service was slow, and the restaurant was not busy, but had lots of employees."}
{"text":"I'm hard to impress when it comes to pizza but this was the best meal I had in Vegas. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the waitress. We waited a good 15 minuets at the table before we even saw her. There were 3 other tables seated after us and their servers came over right away.  The food was great. Really good pizza and I love that the captured NYC style pizza. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"My rating is based on the dessert, because it's the most important meal of the day ;)  First the food info. I didn't have pizza, I had house salad (bland, not great), green olives (not pitted!!! My teeth would have appreciated a heads up), the bruschetta (I was about an hour late to the party and they were mush by then), the cheesecake (sweet heaven!), cannoli (I thought they were okay, but those with me were in love).   I have never been a cheesecake fan, but this place changed that :D It was soft & sweet and just amazing. I'm told that they change their cheesecake selection based on the seasons (that confused me because we only really have 2 in Az, lol). I can't wait for the strawberry cheesecake in the summer!!!  They have a small parking lot behind the pizzeria building, but there's plenty of street parking."}
{"text":"In Arizona this is one of the few places that has good New York style pizza. I ordered to go and didn't eat at the place and got a small pepperoni and onion red sauce pizza and an onion white garlic sauce pizza. Both were delicious but the white garlic pizza was better. It was quick to be made (20 min) and easy to pick up aside from one thing.., they have parking right outside of Scottsdale Quarter specifically for delivery and pick ups which is 15 min, this was blocked off by white cones and no one was parked there so parking absolutely was awful for pick up... This should really be fixed... Other than that great pizza"}
{"text":"OK picture this... 106 degrees outside in the shade in the middle of the AZ desert.  Some one had a fantastic idea, lets put a BRICK OVEN PIZZA shop here in Peoria!!  Awesome pizza.  I was looking for some good pie as I am missing the east coast.  I found this place in a nice upscale outdoor shopping plaza.  I walked in and was seated pretty much right away.  I ordered a soda and the large pie, (I had a feeling I would eat well in the hotel later, I was right).  I got pepperoni and mushroom.  The pizza came out about 20 min later and it was fantastic, the crust was thin and properly blackened from the brick oven, the sauce was proportioned well with crushed tomato and the mozzarella was applied in slices which was a nice touch.  I ate half and took the other half to go.  It was just as delicious later.  When I went in I did not know that this was a chain and was a pizza company started in NYC but has grown across the country.  I cannot wait to get home and try out the Tampa location!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe my eyes when I seen that Grimaldi's is in Vegas!  I had watched a show on the food network about the original in Brooklyn so we were starved and decided to go pronto.  Our waitress was great, she explained that all ingredients were flown in from NY to make their masterpiece.  The pizza is pricey, each topping is $2, but it's totally worth every penny.  We also shared a small salad, enough for three.  The decor is great, many pictures of Brooklyn.... BK is in tha house for sure!  I will be craving this pizza pie for many days to come, thin crust, coal oven baked deliciousness.  The house red is also really tasty.  Can't wait to go back, this will be a must do place from now on!"}
{"text":"Honestly came in here with no expectations and was blown away by how great the pizza is here! I had received a lot of recommendations (in particular, Greg Laurie raved about this place!) about this place and have driven by it countless times. I had family in town so we figured we would finally check it out! There was only one thing I was bummed about: why did I wait so long to go here?!! Pizza came out and on the first bite you could tell it was made to order. I looove pizza but am not usually a big fan of the crust but I would have to say that was one of my favorite parts of this pizza! You could tell it was housemade. Crust was great, sauce was great, and you could tell that the pizza was topped with quality ingredients. Our waitress was very attentive and able to answer all the questions we had since it was our first time there. Inside of the restaurant the decor was NYC themed and it wasn't too big inside. It was intimate and would make for a great date night spot. Overall, incredible pizza and great service makes for an excellent restaurant. I can't think of a single negative thing I could say.  Thanks, Grimaldis!"}
{"text":"So far, so good. Last week I signed up for Grimaldi's newsletter to receive a free 18\" one topping pizza on my birthday. Well, here I am (all by myself). No waiting because I sat in the bar area with tall stools. (No one else wanted to sit here).  My house salad has arrived. It looks so much better than the usual bowl of lettuce with one small tomato slice I get at most places. In fact, the bowl is so large that I know I'll have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. It comes with mushrooms, green olives, cherry tomatoes and peppers. Definitely NOT your average house salad. Me likey! :-)  I ordered the 18\" pizza with ground beef. It was good, but I prefer a thicker pizza crust. I also ordered a piece of butterscotch cheesecake. That was also good, but I would have preferred the peppermint cheesecake that they were out of. I crave white cheesecake with a flavored topping. This butterscotch cheesecake was butterscotch colored and flavored throughout. Not my favorite, I've decided it would have tasted better had it also been free for my birthday. ;-)  Thank you, Grimaldi's for my free birthday pizza. I'll be back next December."}
{"text":"Mediocre service offset by well priced food that is decent. Interesting decor and convent location"}
{"text":"I LOVE coming here. Their house and Caesar salads are scrumptious. Fabulous portions for the price. Great service. The hostess (young tall man) has an awesome personality! Very nice environment. I suggest dining inside because the tables outside are too crowded. Pizza is pretty pricy. :)"}
{"text":"Go here at least once a month. The pizza is always great, best in Vegas I've had since I moved here 10 years ago. If you're a fan of New York style thin crust pizza, this is your new go to."}
{"text":"We just arrived in Las Vegas and we were starving! I remember that there was a Grimaldi's close by and so we headed over. On a Saturday afternoon, I was surprised to see a fairly empty restaurant. We decided to sit at the patio - a big mistake because it was pretty hot outside, but oh well.  My fiancé and I ordered the small pizza (16 inches) with jalapenos, pepperoni, mushrooms, bacon, and green peppers. 20 minutes pass and we see a pizza heading our way. The waiter drops the pizza at our table and serves our first slice. My fiancé was so hungry that he starts taking bites. I was so hungry too that I take my first bite and I tasted something I didn't like. I study the pizza - it's olives! Ugh - olives. Then I scrutinize the pizza more and realized that this pizza is definitely not the pizza we ordered - not at all. It has olives, sausage, ricotta cheese.... We try to find our waiter and we can't find him anywhere.   We see the guy that refills drinks and we tell him that we have the wrong pizza. A waitress comes our way and nonchalantly apologizes, tells us that our pizza is still in the oven and that if we wanted to box this pizza up to take it home, we can since it was going in the trash. We accepted as we had family who would be glad to eat it.  Ten minutes or so later, our pizza, the \"real\" one comes out. It was amazing! I loved every bite of it. The pizza was pretty big - good for two, or three people.   Food = 4. Service = 2. Value = 3   Total Bill before Tip: $28.11"}
{"text":"I wish I could eat at Grimaldi's every night. But really, I have an addiction to both the pizza and the caesar salad (I don't usually like caesar salad so this is saying a lot). I like to add a few toppings to the pizza (jalapeños, ricotta cheese, onions, mushrooms) which makes the price go up a bit (this combination is so delicious it is worth it). Plus, I usually have leftovers for the next day- double bonus. The staff is super friendly and also very fast. I always look forward to the next time that I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Grimaldi's Pizza.  The Better Half and I stopped in here for dinner and we had a huge appetite.....which is dangerous in a Pizza joint for me.  I ordered: Caprese Salad - $7 Personal Sized Pizza ($9) with: Sundried Tomatoes - $4 Red Peppers - $4 Ricotta Cheese - $2 Mushrooms - $2 Jalapenos - $2 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=DZ7xu0LF2IIg2_dI1c_CrA  The Better Half ordered a personal sized Pizza ($9) with: Pepperoni - $2 Mushrooms - $2 Feta Cheese - $2 Basil - $2 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=1PaOTe8Ys9uJUP3u4DjHiQ  Yeah, all toppings are al la carte here....so it's not cheap.  The Pizza was awesome!  I enjoyed every bite.  The combination of the sweet taste of Sun Dried Tomatoes combined with the spicy kick of Jalapenos mixed in with Ricotta, Mushrooms, and Red Peppers hit the spot! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mz48xdVWcCu463U3Lm7lhA?select=l4mZAt7mXpslp4LqexFy5g  The Better Half enjoyed her Pizza too.  Since I'm on my no Meat diet, I took her word for it....as much as I was tempted to give it a try, I resisted....maybe next time.  To wash it down, she had 2 glasses of Brazin Zinfandel $8 ea, I had 2 O'douls $4 ea.  All in, the dinner was $72 before tip.  Overall, it was a nice dinner.  I finished my food, she took home 1/2 of her Pizza.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Ok, I was heading home after checking out another Pizzeria and decided today was Pizza day and stopped by here to give it a try.  I didn't expect to find a nice restaurant, but that's exactly what the place is like.  It's tucked between the Summerlin renowned Kona Grill & Gordon Biersch in the Boca Park Shopping Center.  This spot has failed numerous times over the past 5 years.....I hope these people make it.  Anyway, I sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon.  They don't serve Pizza by the slice here....so I had to go for a 12\" Personal Pizza.  Since I already had 3 slices from the other joint, I knew I had my work cut out for me despite the small size.  I decided on a Pepperoni & Jalapeno Pizza.....the bartender Aubrey or was it Audrie?....anyway, she said the Jalapenos kick your ass, so was I sure I wanted it......of course I do!  The restaurant has a cool & comfortable feel to it.  I'll have to bring the family back sometime soon.  After a few minutes my Pizza came out.  It was much larger than I expected.  The thin crust was cooked nice and cripsy....well done, just how I like it.  However, there is a lot of sauce on this Pizza.....more than I normally like, -2 in my book.    The flavor of the sauce overwhelms the Pizza, so it's hard to taste the other ingredients.  The Pepperoni is the tiny almost Slim Jim type and had good flavor to it....too bad it was drowned in sauce.  Aubrey/Audrie was right, the Jalapenos do pack a serious Punch.....I was sweating pretty good after a couple of slices, and no it wasn't from the 100 degree DRY Vegas heat....it was from the Jalapenos.....good thing Aubrey/Audrie kept my Blue Moon full.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and the Pizza.  Will I return?  Yes, I will bring the family with me next time and try a different pie."}
{"text":"Tell you what, I am a pizza fan! If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be pizza! We went there for a work lunch and prices are kinda high, and pizza was kinda of dry.  There are better places out there..."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Talk about authentic Brooklyn pizza it's so yummy (original restaurant was started in New York). Based on a friends suggestion we came over to the Venetian to eat here. We were greeted warmly and sat down. We were well attended to the whole time even though our waiter had just been sat at least a 15 top. The small salad was more than enough for two and the house vinaigrette is delicious. My boyfriend preferred the Caesar.  And the personal pizza hit the spot I got the garden freak minus the Roma tomatoes. If you're looking for a great pizza place this is the one."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, great service (thank you, Bryna) and a very nice outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"The pizza here was amazing!!!!  We also ordered the caesar salad, caprese salad.  The fresh mozzarella and the tomato sauce on the pizza were excellent and the thin crust was great too.  I enjoyed the shaved parmesan on the caesar salad.  I'm used to having caprese salads with balsamic glaze and pesto and Grimaldi's gave us a bottle of balsamic vinegar and olive oil and the salad did not have any pesto.  It was still good, but definitely missed the pesto and balsamic glaze.  The customer service was good and it wasn't busy so we were sat right away.  I would come back here again."}
{"text":"As a pizza freak, I love a good pie. I really look forward to my infrequent visits to this local hot spot. Bottom line, very thin crust, light on the sauce, a little over priced, but still very well worth the visit & the price. Without a doubt I highly recommend Grimaldi's. The pepperoni & kalmata olives large pizza is my absolute favorite. I have probably gotten 20 people hooked on their pizza & it's turned into a must go to lunch spot for my sales crew. The service is excellent & Vince & Rob do a super job with the staff. My wife though thinks it's highly overrated & would rather have Verrazano's or Villa. What does she know, she's from Missouri & grew up in Vegas."}
{"text":"Grimaldis is stepping up their game for sure! In my personal opinion, I think it's one of the best in Vegas.   Let's get straight to the point. First off drinks: Italian Margarita - by far my favorite drink. It's got amaretto mixed into this so a margarita with a sweet twist.  Paloma Italian - tequila and grapefruit - yum Bloody Mary - great but a strip of bacon would've been the perfect finishing touch  Mule - you can either get it with vodka or bourbon - the bourbon one is fantastic and they use a good quality ginger beer Wine- Grimaldis makes their own red wine and when paired with the pizza...oh boy!  Starters: Bruschetta Trio - Mushroom/red pepper, tomato and basil, roasted artichoke - loved them all, especially the roasted artichoke.   Mediterranean salad - kalamata olives was the star. Dressing made in house.  Kale chopped everything salad - kale is usually bitter but this was perfectly mixed with the lemon vinegarette  Spinach salad - delicious but not a fan of raw onions  Pizzas: Classic Margherita Pizza - I love that all the pizzas that were served came out steaming hot and all of them and a nice not so thick crunchy crust and the right amount of topping. This particular pizza was good but I'm a big meat eater Quattro Formaggi - aka white cheese pizza - get this if you're a cheese lover The Don - my favorite pizza - Italian sausage, meatballs and pepperoni Joe's special pizza - also one of my favorites. It's a custom pizza with spinach, kalamata olives and bacon!   Service was great and the server really knew the menu inside and out. So many options to choose from - I have to come back and try everything else."}
{"text":"The food is good,  as always.  The service was subpar. Our server was barely nice.  It seemed forced.  He did not check on us once after the pizza was brought to the table.  When he thought we were done,  he came to take the plates away.  We were not finished.  We were thirsty. He seemed irritated to bring us refills, but he did.  A little attention goes a long way towards a better tip."}
{"text":"Where do I start? How about with SURPRISING? I was reluctant to try this place because their online menu seemed so limited and, well, the pizza seemed a little too pricey. I was wrong on all accounts. The menu offered plenty of options. We settled on an 18 inch traditional pizza with meatballs, mushrooms, black olives and bell peppers.  It did not disappoint!!! The thin crust was delightful. The homemade sauce, divine.  Oh, and the meatballs are delicious! I wish that they offered spaghetti and meatballs but, remember, this is not an Italian place, it is a pizza place. Rather, it is THE pizza place. I cannot believe how amazing this pizza is!  We capped off dinner with a Dessert Trio and opted for three different types of cheesecake which I HAD to try after our host explained that they make it fresh daily and then touted that it could go toe to toe with any cheesecake in town. I LOVE me some good cheesecake and theirs is like a creamy piece of Heaven.   All of the staff that we encountered were great. Pleasant, knowledgeable, attentive and helpful! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I am not a pizza connoisseur but if I were I am sure this place would be at the top of the list. Their pizza is divine and I am not one to eat crust but here I do because it is not an overpowering clump of dough like in just about every other pizza joint that I have been to.  Delicious and not too pricey! The Margherita Pizza is to die for."}
{"text":"First time eating at Grimaldi's. This place takes you out of Arizona, love the design of the place. I ordered the strawberry spinach salad. 100% recommend it!  I also ordered GF pizza only comes in 1 size. Which is 12\" size. I would have liked it to come in a smaller size or more to offer for GF. My pizza was $15 alone for a lunch, it was tasty just pricy for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza while in Vegas. We sat at a table near the bar and experienced fantastic service from both, our server and the bartender. Food came out quick and hot and the beer was cold. The atmosphere is open with lots going on. We will make this on of our regular stops on our annual Vegas trips."}
{"text":"This is the second Grimaldi's pizza joint I have visited and it did not disappoint. We were in Phoenix and sat outside on a cool Saturday afternoon. Our server was Shayne and she was very attentive. The pizza was great and the beer was even better.. We'll check out Grimaldi's whenever we are visiting other parts of the US."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is an overall decent place for pizza. The service was spot on and the relative price of the pizza options are reasonable.   The pizza itself was fine. I wasn't blown away but I was pleased and full when I it was all said and done.  The location is also worth mentioning. The mall it's in has a casino just downstairs and a multitude of stores just a step away."}
{"text":"I walked in here the other night with a friend not knowing what expect.  My friend says to me, \"oh they have great pizza here.\"  Of course my friend has the taste buds of a dog, and dogs lick their own butts, so I took his comment with a pound of salt.  The hostess was super nice and eager to help.  Walked us to the bar, explained the menu, made a recommendation (pepperoni, tomatoes and garlic which we went with), and took our order.  I think if she could have helped us devour the pizza, she would have been right there with us.  Pizza came to about $24, and for a quality pizza I think $20ish...so slightly above what I was expecting.  Once I folded my slice in half (as you should) and put that first bite in my mouth, I knew instantly where every penny of that $24 went.  It went into that first bite and I still had the rest of that slice plus three more to look forward to.  I'm pretty blown away and really don't have much to nitpick here.  This is just a single experience, and a take-out one at that, so the five stars should be taken lightly.  There will definitely be a round two at this place."}
{"text":"Took my Fiancé there for her birthday pizza was so good service was great good wine Selection i cant wait to go back we had the Caesar salad and a werid combo pizza that we built Artichoke mushroom jalapenos and pepperoni Over red sauce such a perfect combo i wish i knew our server name but i had a great time"}
{"text":"Best margarita pizza and the don pizza! It's so juicy and delicious. The sauce is so tasty and delicious. It feels like you're drinking tomato juice/soup from the margarita pizza which is amazing! The slices are big and amazing, I can easily kill the small size. And it's only a couple more dollars for the medium and large, so I think it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and the pizza is so good. All the pizzas are so delicious. Every time I come to Arizona I always have to visit this place."}
{"text":"Love their pizza. This location is great and parking is adequate. Took a while to be seated and if you have to sit outside the water misters help with the heat. When we come visit relatives in AZ we always make a stop at Grimaldis for their delicious pizza. I don't know what it is but their pizza is always consistent and have never disappointed us."}
{"text":"Good pizza! Definitely New York style...I'm not a fan of thick crust by any means, so this place definitely fits my bill. It can get a little pricey for what you're getting when you start putting toppings on your pizza, which is why I am only giving it 4/5 stars. Otherwise I would give them a full house.   Their staff was very friendly and attentive! It seems more and more restaurant staff are overworked because they cut staff, but this restaurant had a perfect size staff who all were great to deal with!"}
{"text":"We stopped by late on Oct 15, 2016 after the Monster Energy Cup. Seated immediately. Ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom. It was FANTASTIC! My wife and I ate the whole thing!    Very nice atmosphere. Love the decorations and lighting.  The staff was friendly and attentive.   We'll be back next year!"}
{"text":"We have now visited Grimaldi's twice and both times the pizza was amazing!!! The sauce is delicious and instead of layered on the bottom it is sprinkled on the top. We also have gotten cheese cake for dessert and it was so good."}
{"text":"Horrible. After hearing so much about Grimaldis and the lack of good pizza on the west side of the Las Vegas valley I thought I'd give it a try since I live less than 2 miles away. While ordering I asked for a side of pizza sauce and they asked if I wanted to come in to pick it up or if I wanted curbside pickup. I asked for curbside. They said 20-25 minutes. I left right away and arrived there 10 mins. after placing my order.  I parked in front and after 5 mins of waiting I decided to go inside. To my surprise it was already at the bar waiting. If it was ready why didn't they check to see if I was there to give me my pizza? And after sitting at the bar for who knows how long the pizza was cold. I got home 24 mins. after ordering my pizza. If I had waited the time they told me I would have picked up an even harder, colder pizza. The sauce was refrigerator cold which was annoying. The pizza was paper plate thin and although I ordered extra cheese it barely had any. I had to reheat the pizza when I got home but even so it was horrible. For $25 the largest pizza they had was so thin that all 8 pieces barely filled my wife and I. Metro pizza is much better and half a pizza fills us both. Will never go there again"}
{"text":"We came in during the Super Bowl and wow the staff was still on their 'A' game. Thank you to the manger on duty Marla for running the floor while having the entire crowd singing with Beyonce!!! Pizza was done to perfection just as we would expect, even though the kitchen was cranking out all those to go orders. If you haven't come to the \"Quarter\" for Grimaldi's pizza...get in here!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was yummy! Service was quick. I wasn't sure when I took my fist bite if I'd like it because it had a really bad burnt flavor but it was just the black stuff that comes off the brick oven. We also ordered a pesto pizza that was good but heavy with the pesto & olive oil. I will eat here again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and pizza! Also love Peroni beer. Staff is always friendly. Love come here for our birthdays"}
{"text":"I love this place! And always have but now that they have a full bar it is even better! Prices might be higher then you want but hey if the food and drinks and service are great I'll pay for that!   My favorite cocktail so far is the lemon honey smash closely followed by the aperol fin spritz!  All $2 off during happy hour (3:30-6pm)   I love love love the ceaser salad and the white pizzas but honestly never had anything bad.   The bartender is always good company, Kurt, always so nice and very good at his job. I visit this location mostly because of him.  Their cheesecake is to die for! I always get one Togo!  Nice patio. Curbside pickup if you wish. (Ovens are off between 4 and 5 for cleaning.) still worth the wait!  The atmosphere is relaxing but I still feel like I am having a great time! God for parties!"}
{"text":"If we are ever in the mood for pizza Grimaldi's is always the first pizza place we think of going/ordering take out. The cesar salad is great and the pizza is delicious!! We usually get a large pepperoni and cheese but we have tried other flavors and they are all delicious. During the weekend we usually just get take out since the wait is usually long. We have and will definably be back for more. The only thing I would ask for is more options on desserts."}
{"text":"In my opinion the best pizza in town.  Great ingredients.  Service is always good.  A little pricey for pizza though.  I guess you get what you pay for, in a good way this time."}
{"text":"Good pizza. They jacked our order up and took 50 minutes to get our pizza but the manager waiver the charge and the pizza was free. Hard to be upset when they make it right. I'd recommend."}
{"text":"I'm always searching for the best pizza and I think I've found the best pizza I've ever had in Vegas. The interesting thing is that this place serves a NY style pizza and I haven't even had a pizza this good when I was in NY.   Their LOCATION is on the second floor above the casino of the Palazzo Hotel which is a prime location if you're staying on the strip and don't have a car.   As for the PIZZA, it's NY style thin crust pizza but wow, what a crust. Not too soggy, not too crispy but just right. The ingredients tasted fresh and it's not too greasy either. On top of everything, THE PRICE is awesome. My friend and I ordered an 18incher (we ate the whole thing)for less than 20 dollars.  With the extra toppings that we ordered it came to a little over 20 but that's still cheaper than Papa John's.   The ENVIRONMENT is pretty huge with a NY style of decor.  They have a standard bar and dine in area towards the back.   The SERVICE was good, however we did go at a pretty slow time. The pizza came out in a very reasonable time and our server was friendly.   Overall, I have to give them 5 stars because I think I will make it a tradition to eat here every time I come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.....I didn't care for the location but it is easy to get in and out, especially when located in a mall.   The pizza was delicious and 5-6 selections on salads.  Ordered the large and it easily fed 3-4.  We had sangrias which were delicious and not a bad wine selection.  All in all it was very good.  Our waitress was awesome and gave great recommendations."}
{"text":"This place has awesome pizza. That's all I can really say about that. It's awesome.  The place is priced pretty high though, but it is Scottsdale after all, and the mentality there is that it's acceptable to overcharge and have an attitude. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  It's also usually packed also, expect a bit of a wait. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  Oh, and the parking. It's Old Town Scottsdale, so naturally, parking is a NIGHTMARE, every lot is full, I think I had to park half a block away on a Saturday night. But that's OK, the food is awesome.  Honestly, I don't really remember if the service was any good. ... But that's OK, the food is awesome."}
{"text":"We often dine here and have always had a great experience.  The last time we were here, our order was incorrect and not only did they make us another pizza, but they also let us take home the incorrect one free of charge and they put it in a heater until we were ready to leave."}
{"text":"Honestly one of my favorite places to eat. The atmosphere is just as great as the food. The only downside is that the pizza does not taste as great when taken home in a box versus eating in the restaurant. It gets soggy pretty quickly. So I would recommend eating there if you like your crust crispy."}
{"text":"5+++++ stars for this restaurant. I felt like I was in New York all over again. Most delicious NY style pizza!!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza. Came here with a friend for dinner, we did half and half. Lovely vibe and friendly staff"}
{"text":"We couldn't leave without leaving a review. It was such a surprise to be seated so quickly and receive such excellent service.  Yadira made our experience totally enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a very reasonable price.  Good for a family dinner or date night.  I highly recommend the pesto or white pizza sauce.  It's like a traditional back east pizza."}
{"text":"The only place in town that satisfies a craving for great pizza is Grimaldis.  Just returned from another great meal at the Scottsdale Quarter location.  The pizza was cooked to perfection and our salad was great.  They have the best feta cheese.  In addition to the food, they have the best staff in town.  Brad and Marla do an outstanding job to provide excellent customer satisfaction.  Another great evening and we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"for a chain, this place is legit.  I ate 3 out of 4 nights I was in Vegas.  Pizza is consistent and very good.  the sauce and crust is on point."}
{"text":"The pizza here is way above par!  Wood fired pizza and it's very tasty.  Always packed and the pizza is very consistent.  If you dont like pizza, try this one.  Ruling."}
{"text":"We love to eat at Grimaldi whenever we are in town. I prefer this location over the one in Fashion Show Mall; the pizza is just better here. It also helps that it's open until 2:00 AM.   A favorite is the Don. I like to customize it because I don't eat meatballs. They won't let you substitute or do \"half & half.\" For that reason, I have to deduct a star. Seems like an establishment that caters to its customers would allow a minor substitution or half-and-half on a pizza. Perhaps that's just me.  Our pizza came out smoking hot and it was absolutely delicious. It was the perfect way to end a long drive into sin city. He also ordered a Caesar salad which was really good.  Service was friendly and efficient. No complaints there. Just wish they monitored the bathrooms more frequently. They were absolutely disgusting. That's unacceptable.  I love the pizza here, but I can only give them four stars because the bathroom was disgusting and I wish they would allow us to do half-and-half on our pizza or at least a minor substitution."}
{"text":"RIDICULOUS! Planned dinner here and unbeknownst to us they were 'stoking' their ovens and were unable to cook ANYTHING. Their staff had no idea when they sat us WITH menus and as a result our dinner plans were ruined,  unless we wanted to have salad for the next 45 minutes and blow off the rest of our plans. Explaining our frustration to the manager fell on deaf ears. He stated he didn't understand why we were so upset and that no other customers ever were upset about this. (While we were discussing, several other customers were seated with menus getting ready for the same rude suprise). He said this is just what they do from 4 to 5 everyday. When I suggested they put this on the door for folks to know, he said  it wouldn't make any difference, and I would still be in the same situation now, so what did it matter. (Kudos to my husband for not punching him in the face).  I explained to him that while people that work there are aware that nothing can be cooked from 4 to 5 that customers who aren't in the business may not be aware of that, and may not have the time to wait around. It's simply courteous to do so. This  seemed to be  a foreign concept to the manager  who said he had no plans of changing any process they have ,  was very rude and condescending ,  and didn't even seem to notice that the same thing was happening to several customers  sitting around us while we were speaking  being told they couldn't eat what they expected to come in to eat at that time either. He also didn't seem to be at all concerned that he'd lost  the business of customers  as a result  of his  attitude  and  inconsiderate approach to handling the situation. This restaurant projects itself as a high-end Eatery- they need a manager who can match that image. Will not be frequency again to this location and will alert everyone I know since he apparently has no plans to do so. Bottom line is Grimaldi's does not have any concern for schedules,  time or convenience of paying customers and we'll meet any voiced concern with condescension and rudeness.  On the flip side- Bucca de Beppos was willing to make me a calzone that's not even on the menu! And what delicious food, in and out quick and GREAT customer service. They are in the same plaza as Grimaldis...skip over to Bucca de Beppos instead for 100% great experience! Update: appears one of the waitresses left a nasty comment on this review.  Sealed the deal. Empowered women know their worth and demand the treatment they deserve"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and sweet service from Kimberly!   We had the caprese salad but the tomatoes were not ripe enough.  Basil was super crisp and fresh though.  Large pizza with pepperoni and mushroom was plenty and tasty!"}
{"text":"How? How? HOW do you make pizza taste that bland? It's astounding! I don't think I could bake a purer form of disappointment if I tried.  Even more surprising was the number of patrons that were there, and more surprising still I see signs announcing new locations. Jeez.  Too expensive and not yummy, move along."}
{"text":"my friend and i were expecting a lot from this place because we've eaten at the original location in brooklyn. the pizza was yummy! it seemed a little bit different from what we remember...not as light and airy as the pizza we had in brooklyn but still very good. i love the thin crust! you can honestly finish a whole small pizza without feeling like you need to be rolled out of the place. we also shared a small house salad which turned out to be more then enough food for two. great service. we had a cute waiter and he was funny. totally coming back here."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I am reading so many bad reviews about the service at Grimaldi's. I have never had bad service. It has always been stellar at the Rainbow location as well as Boca Park. Not to mention that the pizza is incredible...It isn't your typical New York pizza (not that I have any opposition to a good New York pie). It is brick oven fired...which gives it an incredibly crunchy crust without being dry like a cracker. They also have a decent wine list for a pizza joint, if you are into that sort of thing. My hubby and I usually get a pepperoni and mushroom(with fresh basil added after it is taken out of the oven). We always leave happy. Especially if we decide to order a half and half sangria (half red sangria, half white.) Delish."}
{"text":"Stopped by Grimaldis this past week for a drink with a friend. We both had a glass of wine each as we were killing time before our movie started. When we were finished the bartender took my card to process the payment; now I don't know what happened with the computer on Grimaldi's end but the comment the bartender says next was not necessary. He assumed I was trying to cheat them and that I had no money on my card as he says, 'I know what's going on here' and looks at me.   I was so shocked I looked back at him in disbelief as he asks me if he can run my card again. I say yes; still in shock, angry, and frustrated at this point, and again the card didn't work and the computer began to freeze all together.   The bartender then leaves with my card and doesn't tell me what's going on and proceeds to get another employee over to assist. They take a picture of my card for record and the other employee noticed the computer was frozen and they finally got it to work.   All in all everything from the ending was unprofessional and could've been handled so much better and differently. Not only was I embarrassed by the bartender but also treated so poorly by the staff. No apology was given. I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza we've had in a long time! We ordered a small pizza with meatballs, and the amount of food was perfect for the two of us. Cheesecake is a must if you have room for dessert :)"}
{"text":"I had heard many great things about this pizza so it was on a high pedestal for reference, and maybe because it was Father's Day they phoned it in, but I don't get to go out and spend $80 on dinner that often (food price only). I wanted to go to Pizzeria Bianco downtown but they are closed on Sunday's. Grimaldi's was stoking the fire, which takes about 45min, but we decided to wait. Ordered a house salad and a caprese salad. Also put an order in for 1sm (16\") regular sauce pizza w/pepperoni for the kids and 1sm white with 4 veggies on it. The price is per topping, even if it's only on half  of the pizza ($2-$4 each).   The house salad had a fly at the bottom, which looked like cracked pepper until my daughter almost ate it (the manager removed it from the bill). The service was terrible, the entire time. She ran behind me when we had outer mouths full and asked how we were doing without stopping. I had asked originally that I would want some wine but wanted to look over the menu, and all the menus were taken along with the glasses when I was in the bathroom. One busboy brought us new plates for the pizza and then another one came, stacked them up and took them away without asking. The waitress couldn't hear us over the din of an empty restaurant, so I felt like I was yelling and she said she didn't hear what I said when I didn't say anything. We were rushed, told not to get larges, which would have worked for us better because we like pizza leftovers and got none, there were no pre-built recommendations and everybody's meat and veggies are different from the next place. I had to cut the large pizza slices for my kids with the butter knife (hard to do and messy, the fork was sharper) because the waitress could not be tracked down. The mozzarella was good, but I've had better. The pizza was good, but I've had better in town. We got a booster seat only after we asked a manager. Sorry all the issues aren't in order, but I keep remembering all the stuff that went wrong while I'm typing and will remember a few more after I'm done. I was so fed up with the service that I didn't order any wine, I just wanted out of there, which took too long because our server was apparently swamped with the other tables.    For the price it wasn't worth it (I feel like deleting the review and repeating that statement for the entire length). My Father's Day dinner was a letdown. The pizza was just OK, the service was something out of the twilight zone.. I'm going somewhere else next time and not going to let people talk about it like it's the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"I was first drawn to the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn a few years ago and since then, I've been returning to a number of their franchises both in Nevada and Florida. Known for their coal-fired brick ovens, the pizzas are great, but nothing like the first time I stepped into their Brooklyn storefront. Maybe it was the New York water or being cooked in that original over 100-year-old brick oven, but it was just better.   Grimaldi's has since then franchised out and I'm not sure if they even own that location in Brooklyn anymore. The pizza recipe and flavor is probably diluted a bit, but I love that familiar chewy crust. The ingredients are fresh and it definitely compares to any $15 fancy pizza that you may find in a hipster metropolitan restaurant. Although I love the classic margherita, the white sauce with garlic is also a nice option."}
{"text":"The food is excellent here. We tried their BBQ chicken pizza (cilantro, red onions, grilled chicken and BBQ sauce) and Don Jon (full of meats- pepperoni, sausage) and their kale salad (lemon based vinaigrette).  Cocktails were delicious as well- the Limoncello Long Island and Strawberry Basil Martinis.   The service was okay. I have high standards because I used to own two restaurants. So if I come across great service, I am a great tipper. However, the service wasn't bad and it wasn't great. It was average- like he was going through the motions but didn't really care for our answers. I can feel the insincerity. We had to ask for slices of lemons three times before somebody other than our server, brought them out. We had a baby with us and asked for additional napkins. We asked three times before he finally brought them out. He seemed annoyed by our requests. They weren't difficult ones just standard ones. I didn't like it at all. He did check on us and ask how everything is but didn't seem to stay long enough to really hear our answers. Like I said, no sincerity.  Hence, three stars. Good food but when I dine in at a sit down restaurant the service is equally part of the restaurant as well and I take that into consideration when I write my reviews."}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G pizza  great staff, great wine selection. I highly recommend for everyone to try at any of their locations. my absolute favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"I've been to quite a few of the best pizza places here in Phoenix. So far Grimaldis is my favorite among all of them. They're pretty consistent, at least every time I go the pizza is great. Usually when I go I get a large pepperoni pizza so I don't spend much."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I was in the mood for thin crust and this place delivered. There was something about the dough that had a unique taste which was good. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"My husband swears this is the best pizza he has ever had. We had a pizza for lunch which we shared. The service was good. The manager stop by everyone's table to be sure everything was OK. They do give a veterans discount, but you do have to ask for it. When we are back next winter, We plan to stop here anytime we want to have pizza."}
{"text":"A crusty (no pun intended) New Yorker friend of mine has been raving about Grimaldi's pizza in Brooklyn, even in the face of a visit to renowned Phoenix pizza haven Pizzeria Bianco.  As luck would have it, we discovered Grimaldi's had opened a couple locations in the Phoenix area.  He was skeptical it could be as good, but after seeing that they imported the entire concept, including NY water for the dough, he gave it a try and eventuially convinced me to accompany him.  I have to admit, it was excellent.  The very hot, coal oven gave a creat cripiness to the bottom of the thin, NY-style crust.  We ordered two pizzas - one with meat, one with veggies, both were great.  I hate to play into a New Yorker's ego, but in this case, my friend was right, Grimaldi's was excellent."}
{"text":"I CAN'T WITH THIS PLACE   our server was SO BAD. like not regular bad, like SO SO SO BAD.  he brought out the wrong pizzas - TWICE - screwed up our bill - TWICE - was super slow - and still even after correcting him - we didn't get the pizza we wanted - we ended up just being like ok fine fine.   the manager came over and said she was gonna take money off our bill... she refunded $2.00 but then that didn't even make sense b/c we were charged for toppings we did not get.... skip this nightmare."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, even though the first time I came here it was a touch better.  The sangria was awesome as well.  The fam shared a large cheese, and I have no complaints!  Staff was nice too."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here the other night.  Grimaldi's in NYC is one of our favorite pizza joints of all time, so when we're in Vegas, we try to stop by to get a taste.  We've never been to this particular location before, but we wanted to get away from the strip.  (It was about a 15 minute drive from the strip.)  We strolled in at 10:30pm, and they were due to close at 11:00, but we were still welcomed with no fuss.  The place was pretty empty, though we saw several take out orders come and go.  Two of us shared a kale salad, a 12\" margherita pizza and a glass of wine, and it was perfect.  Salad was well dressed, pizza was served hot.  (The best thin crust around!)  Service was excellent, and the manager checked in on us too.  Funny story - when our pizza slices were being doled out by the server, my slice slid right off the spatula!  It started to fly towards the ground, and I caught it in the palm of my hand, mid air.  It was quite impressive, and we all cheered.  In hindsight, I should have let it splat; we probably would have gotten a free pizza out of it."}
{"text":"We love this place. It's our go to for great pizza, environment and family eating. The manager is a dream and the wait staff is amazing, friendly and responsive. Come on in !"}
{"text":"First time here with family and we loved it! Nice thin crusted pizza with high quality and generous amounts of toppings. On Tuesday's the wine is 50% off so that was a nice surprise. Our waitress was super attentive and cool, she gave our kids some pizza dough to play with while we waited for dinner, bonus points for that! Great ambiance and courteous staff. We will definitely return next time we're in AZ."}
{"text":"Awful pizza. Boring. Bland. Tasteless.  I didn't even finish it.  What's the deal with the all the good reviews for this chain? Doesn't make any sense to me.  The sauce is watery and acidic. The crust is tough and flavorless. And yet, the place was packed when I was there....really packed!!! Could be another sign of the apocalypse.  This \"coal-fired, brick-oven\" hustle is meaningless.  Doesn't make this much better than Papa John's. But costs twice as much. Not that I'm recommending Papa John's cuz I'm not. But I am saying there are many pizza choices in Las Vegas that are better than Grimaldis. Including the newly-opened Dom DeMarco's.  But for me, the little neighborhood joint on Twain called Sicili, will do just fine.  Don't waste your time on this place; leave it for the pizza muggles. (If you don't know what a 'pizza muggle' is, just read the other reviews.)"}
{"text":"I'm profoundly baffled by all the good reviews for Grimaldis.  The pizza isn't bad; okay,  it's edible...but just barely.  The real problem is that it's boring.   All the elements just don't harmonize.   The crust is overcooked. It's too hard, too crispy with no chewiness. I suggest that the Grimaldi clan go to Settebello in Green Valley and tast real Neapolitan pizza.  Crust should be chewy, not hard dammit! Take a trip to Napoli, the birthplace of pizza, if you don't believe me.  The toppings are not in synch with any of the other toppings. It's as if they were chosen on their own with no awareness of how they would ultimately work together.  And please!  This coal-fired nonsense, and New York water nonsense doesn''t mean anything, except as a marketing ploy to get gullible tourists to think they're eating something special.   If you want great pizza, go down the street to Sicili's Pizza on Twain. It's in a ghetto area, so I don't advise eating in, but as take-out or delivery, it's amazingly good. And at half the price!!!  But if you're a lazy tourist who doesn't want to leave the casino, then you're stuck with this mediocre pizza.  If this represents New York pizza, given the fame of Grimaldi's in New York, I've never been happier not to live in that overcrowded, smelly, cesspool."}
{"text":"Superb pizza and great passion fruit ice tea. Good price too! I loved the pesto red sauce and basil and tomato and mozzarella pizza I had. Great cannoli for desert as well as awesome cappuccino. Will go again!"}
{"text":"You get plenty of pizza for your money, but sometimes the taste and texture can be lacking. Got a large pepperoni and mushroom to go and when I opened it at home, it seemed like the sauce was contained to the middle. This might have been the reason the pizza was so greasy in that area. Towards the crust it was the perfect amount of crispness, but the middle was so soaked with sauce and grease it was hard to eat because it kept flopping down. Not really what I want when I'm buying this sort of style pizza. Maybe it was so greasy due to the size, but I'd have liked every bite to have that crispness.  On the plus side there's lots of pizza left over. On the downside, it's still soggy and greasy in the middle."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Grimaldi's today for lunch.  We decided to try this place one more time. Our last visit resulted in my sister biting into a large piece of coal and breaking her tooth. According to the manager this is common and they are supposed to check the pizza for coal before serving. My sister got the run around for awhile before she finally got her tooth looked at by a dentist. The manager wanted my sister to pay for everything and then Grimaldi's would reimburse. She finally was able to get the insurance information for billing, prior to her dentist appointment. This took several phone calls and a lot of frustration on her part.  Today we decided to check the pizza ourself for coal and sure enough my husband found two small pieces in his pizza slice. Our waitress started out waiting tables and ended up behind the bar serving drinks. We had to ask several other waitresses for another, beer, water, etc., because our waitress never came back to our table.  The service was horrible and the food was not worth the wait or the frustration of bad service!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was outstanding. We had eaten at the uncle's place (Julianna) in Brooklyn because we couldn't get into the original. This place did not disappoint. The pizzas are big and perfect. They are hand tossed and beautifully made.  What sold me immediately was Sean--the host. We were running late and called he reassured all of us our table was safe. He welcomed us like family and got us in quickly. Javier was our waiter and led is perfectly with suggestions.  We will be back. What a great experience."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. Decent beer selection. Good atmosphere.   We will return next time we are in Arizona"}
{"text":"not impressed. our waitress did the absolute bare minimum. my soda was completely flat, i had to swap it for an iced tea. we ordered the garden pizza and it had no flavor! our kids' pepperoni was way better. not worth the $50+ we paid. :/"}
{"text":"Really excellent NY style pizza in a family friendly environment (not Chuck e Cheese at all). Great outdoor space.  Slammed on the weekends"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has the best pizza! Just had the best Mediterranean Salad!! Thanks David, excellent customer service!! My order was perfect!"}
{"text":"I come here for drinks rather than a local watering hole has a nice relaxed atmosphere and the bartenders are always friendly and attentive. The happy hour consist of wine and sangria which are pretty good. I love how the bar opens up to the outside. The food here is good also, overall a nice little friendly place to grab a bite to eat and relax with some friends!"}
{"text":"So cute here!! The ambiance is quite romantic here and I love that they know what they do best and stick with it. There is a healthy wine list to choose from - love the decor and the outdoor seating. The pizza is delightful! I've never before seen my husband eat arugula - but they put it on a white pizza with prosciutto and he was all about it!  We'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"The very best pizza in the West Valley,  takes me back to New York City.   I always bring home a pizza for my freezer.   Their salads are bright and crisp.   Not to be missed."}
{"text":"Service was GREAT....place was really cute, didn't feel like we were in a mall at all. Pizza was just \"OK\".. it looked better than it tasted. It was a bit salty, crust was crisp...but the underside was soggy :(. You pay for toppings and ours had hardly any.. I was really hoping for a better pie :( I guess I would try it again, but that might not be for awhile."}
{"text":"Pizza was great service sucks so bad. Server only showed his face one time, the rest of the time I was asking the busser for everything else. Other waitresses don't smile hostess was frowning this place sucks. This place should have been called suicide Pizza.  The only thing that was alive was the pizza!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza I have ever had.  I am a thin crust person so Grimaldi's is perfect.  Salad was excellent as well."}
{"text":"We were very impressed...from the young man who was hosting and greeted us, to the amazing service (Brendan?) provided to our group of 12 (including challenging kids) on Sunday, to the friendly manager and perfectly executed food.  It is obvious that this location is very well run and that the team takes a great deal of pride in the experiences they provide their guests."}
{"text":"Have always been a fan of Grimaldi's in San Antonio. The pizza is so great and the ingredients taste so fresh. They have a great wine selection and the prices are pretty good!   The staff and waitress we had this time was so awesome and very attentive! At the end of our dinner we ordered a New York cheese cake and the manager came back and told us they were all out and instead she comped us a trio of cheesecakes. That was so unnecessary but was a great gesture and we really appreciated that. It was in all a great dinner and awesome costumer service!!!"}
{"text":"Have been 2 a couple of Grimaldi's here in Vegas and I have always enjoyed their food and wine selection. Usually get a large pizza or 2 and salads and the the caprese salad. Pizza is always fresh of course because its made to order Una brick oven pizza which gives it a nice crispiness to it. Ingredients are great as well as the choices. Love the flavor of the sauce and cheeses. The caprese salad isn't great though I wouldn't get it again. Love their salads especially their Greek! Love the wines there is a pretty good selection. Service is always friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice pizza joint. The pizza was in the top 2 or 3 in the city and the salads were very fresh and plentiful. The open kitchen and decor make it very comfortable and fun. We will definitely return for more."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious dinner. I didn't mind much because I love getting out for a while and people watching, but even with a reservation the wait was significantly longer than expected. Reservation for nine, weren't sat until close to 9:45. This was fine for us but would have been a headache if we'd had our young son with us instead of with a sitter. The customer service was amazing, and we could see the team running around like chickens with their heads cut off, doing everything they could to please everybody. Management ought to provide more staff for such a busy location."}
{"text":"Having lived in NYC for a few years, I know a little something about pizza.  I was so thrilled to see grimaldi's open in vegas.  It usually is the only reason why I would cross town to the eastside.  But now they have a summerlin location so it's easier to get my fav pizza in town."}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm a fan!  I have been meaning to try this spot for quite a while and finally made it in on a slow Sunday.  Since I was a newcomer, Erica behind the bar shared some background info on the restaurant, including the coal oven and the filtration process used so that the water for the dough is as close to New York water as you can get in AZ.  Maybe just a gimmick, but I admit, I was impressed.    I decided upon a small caesar salad and a personal white pizza with garlic.  Oh was I surprised when a huge salad arrived - more than enough for two people.  That is a small!?  Yep.  I already could see a to-go container in my future.  It was very good - crisp crutons and just enough dressing.  The pizza arrived quickly and was also very big - the menu states the personal pizzas are 12\", but it appeared larger to me - six slices of gooey, cheesy garlicy goodness atop a wonderfully crisp crust.    I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch, and had lots left over to take home.  It was probably a good thing that I was dining alone, because I am sure that I had major garlic breath after!"}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome and the service was awesome as well. We are from Arizona and we were in Las Vegas for a soccer tournament so we didn't know what to expect but this place was a great find. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I was starting to loose faith in Italian food in Vegas after some bad experiences, and I was soooo thrilled to find this one, by accident, actually. I definitely recommend the made-in-house fried mozzarella, it was the best I've ever tasted and I am very picky with my mozzarella sticks... My only complaint is that the marinara had green peppers in it and that's not one of my favorite flavors... The linguine with clams was to die for... The sauce was sooo yummy, perfect kick to it, not too spicy, very flavorful and lively. It was so good I drank it like a soup after I finished my perfectly cooked pasta! Craft beer on tap, delightful gelato... Everything made fresh to order in-house... It's like eating at a real Italian family's house! I'm in heaven and I'll be back"}
{"text":"I love the location and pizza!! Ingredients you can taste each n everyone of them!  Little pricy but great pizza   I would totally go"}
{"text":"Mmmmm...  garlic!  A recent Sunday afternoon found us wandering around the Scottsdale Quarter.  It was around 3pm, and many of the restaurants were in the lull between lunch and dinner - a great opportunity to try the newest Grimaldi's location without a crowd.    It is no secret that I am a fan of pizza.  While I am typically a 'pepperoni and mushroom' kind of girl, having visited the Grimaldi's DC Ranch location I knew exactly what to get - the White with Garlic pizza.  It is a simple sauceless combination of flavorful cheese and garlic.  Lots of garlic.  And that is a good thing.  We ordered the large, which proved to be much bigger than expected - it nearly covered the entire high-top bar table, making it interesting to juggle plates, pizza, wine (house Montepulciano) and water glasses.  Hey, there are worse problems to have!  I look forward to enjoying more of that coal-fired garlicy goodness soon!"}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever had in my life. Not an exaggeration. I had it last year in Vegas, and went back a few weeks ago just to see if my memory was correct. It was indeed.  My friend and went shopping the next day and came upon another Grimaldi's at the big mall nearby. So we had it yet again.  Yup 2 days in a row. That location wasn't quite as good as this one at the Palazzo, but still great. This location however is stellar on quality.  I can't disagree with someone on taste, since it's subjective- but to the people that say they've had better pizza...for the love of god tell me where that is. No words, just go. Oh, and don't go all fancy. Just the pepperoni. Keep it nice and pure."}
{"text":"I love their pizza...and the employees are awesome....but what's with the smell in this place?!? Sewage smell every time I walk in here. I try to deal with it because my wife really loves the food, as do I...but why can't they correct this problem? Been coming regularly for 6 months, and it always an issue. Am I the only one that notices this??? Would love it to get fixed!"}
{"text":"Last night I went to west side Grimaldi's for the first time.  I've been a fan of their pizza ever since it was introduced to me at work when we were filming TV shows near the eastside location.  I had been meaning to come by and show my support for the \"new\" Grimaldi's by my house for awhile.  We dined on the patio, and it was perfect weather to do so.  Yes, it's that one week in Vegas between hot summers and cold winters.  The service left something to be desired, and I was bummed that there weren't any appetizers on the menu like garlic knots (I swear there used to be, no?) -- but those are my only real complaints.  The pizza was great, and the ingredients were fresh as always.  I'm sure there was a price for the pizza, but I got lucky in that I won some Internet contest and received a $100 Grimaldi's gift card in the mail a month or so ago, so the only money that left my pocket was for a tip."}
{"text":"For a pizza joint, there's none better!  This is as close to Italian as I have found in Vegas.    The crust is on the thin side, with just the right amount of crunch.  The sauce isn't too sweet.  The selection of toppings are plentiful, without being obnoxious, and the service, for the most part has always been good, everybody has an off day.  The Boca Park location is my choice, dine alfresco, and enjoy the views."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times everywhere from lunch with co-works to kids and the husband on the weekend. They never disappoint and they give you a free pizza on your birthday. I never had pizza this good until I ate here. The only other place that I've had since then that compares is Dom Demarcos Pizzeria that a co-worker recommended we try. Overall I give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Usually when I dine in the place is great. I called in an order and not only was it completely incorrect but the girl who rung us up didn't seem to care. The manager saw us leave, obviously less than thrilled, and called 20 min later asking what the issue was. Too little, too late. Food was cold and wrong. 2 pizzas and a salad...$54. At the very least they could have gotten it warm."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for...grown-up pizza. lol!  I probably wouldn't bring the kids, but my husband and I love it for date nights. Amazing coal fired pizza, great salads, great wine!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. It was as good as everyone has been saying. We had a small pizza and a salad and it made a nice light meal for two. We sat on the patio and people watched. Meranda was a great server."}
{"text":"Took a while to get the pizza, they don't have breadsticks, the pizza was over cooked just a little bit, the service was pretty good as the employees were nice, way over priced for what you get!  4 sodas, a 12 inch cheese pizza, a 12 inch pizza with pepperoni on one half and a few meats on the other half and 1 cannoli was $48 without tip."}
{"text":"Stopped in here late after a show.   For 20.00 each we had 3 small pizzas with toppings, 2 soda's, a beer and a glass of wine!  And it was not crowded at all.   The line for the original is around the block in Brooklyn and we had wait but it was just as good.    and a 4.00 glass of wine??   Unheard of in Vegas!  Would go back but try some others out first.  NY is closer for me but i do like no wait!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza with flavor and nicely done crust. Sslad was a nice addition for all.  Definitely go there again"}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA IVE EVER ATE!! So fresh, the meats and cheeses are delish... This place is clean with good pizza omg Im in love... Me and my sister and her friend wen there for the first time last summer and we were blown away by the service and the food. I will be going here again! PIZZA LOVE"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time for my Birthday in April and fell in love with their pizza!!  Everyone was very friendly and very attentive. Drinks were always full and plates were never empty. We have been back a few times since and each time was a great as the last. Would definitely recommend. Also if you join their online 'club\" you get a FREE Pizza for your birthday!!  YES, FREE!!! I would place this definitely on our top 3 pizza list!!"}
{"text":"I will venture to call Grimaldi's a 'down-low' gem, though down-low is misleading. It is in the heart of Old Town, near Nello's and a cluster of other restaurants. However, I am inclined to dub it DL for the pure and simple reason that it never seems to be that crowded.   Considering its location, you would think pizza of this caliber would justifiably command a short wait at the bar or outside on almost any night, but it has just never come to that in my experiences here. It always has a handful of people splotched around the bar and dining room, but I have never once felt cramped or rushed in my times visiting.   I get the sensation that it just hasn't caught on yet, but that soon many of the Oregano's faithful will add it to their restaurant rotation, and before long it will be just as jumpin' as its neighbor."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Came here with my family for a birthday. The bread is good! The pizza was perfect.. pricey but worth it.. The staff were all very nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"Many thanks to GM Brian who donated cannoli's for our Senior ministry Christmas luncheon close to 200 senior citizens enjoyed the delicious dessert that capped a great meal. Brian is always professional, accommodating and very welcoming. Thank you Grimaldi's for having such a great managrt"}
{"text":"If you love pizza, you must come and try it here. Been here a few times and it never disappoints. You can pretty much get whatever you want on the pizza or try the menu. Whichever you choose you will end up with the freshest and best tasting pizza you've ever tried."}
{"text":"Besides the original location in Brooklyn, this is the Grimaldi's location that started the love affair for me.  I'll never forget driving down Scottsdale Road in May 2006, days after I moved into town from Washington, DC and I saw the Grimaldi's sign.  I thought, \"Could it be?  Could Grimaldi's from Brooklyn actually have opened up a new location?!?\"  Sure enough, I learned that they sold the recipe to a company that is opening up franchises (something like that) of the pizzeria.  I was thrilled!  Tasted it and was even more thrilled to see it tasted so similar to the Brooklyn location.    I have been to four locations around the Valley and each one makes excellent thin crust coal burning oven pizza.  Totally top notch!  Best pizza in AZ hands down!    My favorite Grimaldi's pizza: Large with pepperoni, sausage, and basil (baked in).  Can't go wrong.  Also, their \"small\" salads are big enough to share."}
{"text":"I am one of Grimaldi's biggest fans. I have loved the pizza at all of their other locations in Phoenix and Vegas, but the Scottsdale Quarter location has become the weakest link. The past few times I have gone the crust has been over cooked. I love crispy thin crust pizza, but this stuff is all dried out. Also, they skimp on the sauce so much! This has become some of the driest pizza I have experienced in a long time.  Please don't judge all other Grimaldi's only on this location. I think the Old Town and and DC Ranch locations are much better.  I'd like to give it 2.5 stars here, but I'll round up since I love the pizza at all of the other locations. I think I have noticed a decrease in the sauce at other locations as well lately, so I guess I have to start ordering extra sauce (which I never do and think is ridiculous)."}
{"text":"Great Spot to have Dinner with the Kids! Authentic East Coast Pies, reasonable prices, and great Customer service can't ask for much more!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, staff and service were also phenomenal. Our sever, Julissa was very professional and polite as was the manager who came up to us, Joann. Oh, and don't forget to get a slice of cheesecake before you go!"}
{"text":"Ive been remiss in posting updates: But, we have been to Grimaldi's at Park Central numerous times since my original post.  The pizza's are very good, and the ingredients are of good quality. The wine selection is nice. If you go during the spring, you are certain to see some type of celebrity. Also, be sure to sign up for the email's and your birthday to get a free pizza for your birthday.  If you are without children, I suggest you sit at the bar. Quick, and excellent service."}
{"text":"Grimaldis makes a nice thin crust pizza that can be as simple (my preference) or as piled high with toppings as you like . I am addicted to the Mediterranean salad . Delicious vinaigrette , ultra fresh greens , olives , feta and the best shredded mozzarella . They have monthly flavors of cheesecake which we pass on but they sure do look good ! The five star shining star is Lainie . She is a beautiful person and oh so friendly and fun . She makes it such a pleasure to go there . She always has a smile and truly goes out of her way . I enjoy extra mozzarella on my salad . When it wasn't added she immediately fixed it . She is truly a sweetheart and I hope the managers realize that and treat her like gold ."}
{"text":"Great wood fired pizza lots of toppings to choose from, good salads, and ice cold beer."}
{"text":"We ordered half white and half regular large pizza with mushrooms, ham, and sausage. I can't really see what all the hype is about with Grimaldi's. In my opinion, the pizzas were alright. Nothing that I would crave or go back to again. Service was great, though. But overall, just an overpriced pizza joint experience."}
{"text":"As much as I love their pizza, I'm very irritated with them today.  I visited the Gilbert location last Thursday for an early birthday dinner with my children.  I was informed that they were cleaning their ovens and it would be an hour and a half wait.  We did not want to wait that long so I thanked them and said we'd be back in a couple days.  We went back today, only this time we went for lunch so as to avoid the \"oven cleaning\" that apparently happens every day starting at 4:00 pm.  Today however, we were greeting by the hostess only to be told that they are closed to replace the oven.  Really???  I wasted my gas again for this?  You should have told me on Thursday that you were closing to replace the oven."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a wonderful place for a date.  I met him at the restaurant and was pleased to have access to plenty of parking. This made me a happy girl.   There was a table waiting for us (he scored points for getting there early) and our waitress came by almost instantaneously. A+ customer service!  The pizzas are made to order and you have your choice of toppings. No pre-made creations here--you are the creator! After much contemplation we opted for the traditional pizza with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  The crust was perfection, although they could've been more generous with the sauce.    There was a nice wine selection and the waitress gave a refreshingly honest opinion to help me decide. We could've easily split a salad, but we were daring and ordered two varieties--both were pleasers.    There's nothing like excellent pizza, good wine, and a crisp salad while enjoying the company.  What can I say?  He received the first kiss early in the evening."}
{"text":"AMMAAAAAZING pizza. Not thick, deep dish but thin, crispy wood fired pizza (my fave). We got the Greek salad to start which was fresh and delicious. Great wine menu. And we got the bruschetta pizza which was on special. It was basically their famous \"white\" pizza with Roma tomatoes and basil on top. It was so good 3 people killed a large! Service was good and I would definitely return here."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Authentic wood fired pizzas. Cooked fast, taste unlike any normal takeout pizza, unique toppings and a great ambiance at both north Scottsdale locations and old town. We love this place especially that it's super family friendly. Their cheese is NEXT LEVEL. I could just pick it right off the pizza. I love that they have all my favorite toppings and they are FRESH. You can just taste it. Definitely gonna cost you more than dominoes but you'll know why after the first bite. Pizzas are huge too. This is our Friday night go-to!  Family tip: if you go to the DC ranch location there's a playground out back for the kids!!!"}
{"text":"The best. You just walk into this place and you're so glad you did. Tastes as good as it smells. It gets busy here but it's worth the wait if you plan for it. I don't know what else to say? It's brick oven pizza. It's incredible. Also good Greek salads. Just go here."}
{"text":"We stopped in to try this place as a part of a great food tour with Destination Food Tours and tried both their cheese and pepperoni pizzas fresh, hot and crispy from the blazing  coal-fired brick ovens.  The super thin crust was so thin and crisp it was almost like a cracker and the sauce, cheese and topping were in great balance. It was very memorable and we will definitely have to stop back in next time we are back in the area.  A great italian pizza joint."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Grimaldi's so many times I cannot even keep count.  The food is always very good.  The service, however, can be hit or miss.  This review is regarding Grimaldi's overall.  This past month, Grimaldi's offered a promo on gift cards ($50 for a $100 gift card).  I purchased mine on September 13, 2016.  It is now October 3, 2016.  I still do not have my gift card.  My credit card was charged.  I've contacted Grimaldi's twice via phone and three times via email over the past 4 days and not a single call or email has been returned.  They do not answer their main corporate phone line and you can only leave a voicemail in the general mailbox.  I was charged $50 and, three weeks later, I have no gift card.  This is very poor business and even worse customer service.  I ordered this gift card as a GIFT to be given on October 6th (thinking I had plenty time and was planning ahead).  The worse part.....Grimaldi's corporate is based in Phoenix....and I live in Phoenix.  So, one would assume that I should have received this gift card in a timely fashion.  Do not support a business that neglects their customers.  Customer service is paramount, especially in the restaurant business.  Do not offer a promotion that you cannot support.  There are so many choices for high quality pizza (especially in Phoenix).  Go to La Grande Orange Pizzeria or somewhere else, where the customer is their top priority."}
{"text":"it's okay, nothing great. i did like their pizza sauce however. i think secret pizza is better. they use HORMEL's meat products, which was a huge turn off. pizza took quite some time to come out.  nothing much to be said about the service either."}
{"text":"Get the pesto pizza ....get a large ...even if you're solo trust me you'll smash it all!!  I get a dude if the red sauce for dipping ...they have two red sauces ...ask for the more runny one !!!!  So good!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was unique, not a standard mozzarella shred type pizza...which was really all I wanted, but it was good. The crust was a little under cooked. It took 45 minutes which was a problem since they told me 20 and I was running late already. They also charge per topping so my personal pizza was listed at $18 but ended up being $25. I would recommend this place if you want expensive, fancy pizza and you have no where to be. It's definitely not a place to just grab pizza quick while running around the strip."}
{"text":"Yum!! We went two days in a row.  Excellent salad and pizza and QUIET - a great change for Las Vegas.  Loved the food and wine.  It will be a regular stop for us in LV."}
{"text":"My first and last visit at this place. Read some of the reviews and I would say some of the 1 star reviews have similar complaints to mine. Staff here who greet you very snotty doesnt even smile but that is subjective if they like the customer. Waitress took our order in a hurry so appetizer was forgotten until we asked. Corz we were given excuses why it was forgotten. In fairness food is ok not great but ok. Owner or manager should read reviews to better the place or fire couple of people."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's makes a really nice NY-style pizza. The service was friendly and we enjoyed our two personal pies. However, I live in the Northeast and would rate Frank Pepe Pizza (of CT) higher than Grimaldi's when it comes to coal oven pizza. If you're in the Palazzo and want a delicious pizza that won't break the bank, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"By far one of the BEST pizza places i have ever had. Huge slices and the coal oven gives it a great flavor. They made a small mistake on our pizza but they were Super nice abt it, gave us free drinks and made a new one very quickly."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for a few days and we had a gift card for this place.  We are from Reno and love the Grimaldis in Sparks. Service was great and the pizza was perfect.  I spoke with the manager, Devon and complimented him on his staff and the consistency  of the food. The salads are the best and freshest.  Keep up the good work.  The beer is cold. Yes, highly recommend this Grimaldis"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service. This is a nice location that was pretty lively for a Wednesday night at 6pm. If you're a brick oven pizza lover, this is the place for you. I realized that I am a traditional NY kind of pie. I also ordered the calzone. It was small (yeah, right!?!) it could serve 3 people. That was pretty good!!!"}
{"text":"Just honest to goodness pie. The pepperoni is legit and not greasy. When I ask for well done I get well done and shockingly that is rare in the US. All the ingredients taste \"in house\" also rare. HUGE WINE SELECTION as well."}
{"text":"We stopped in today for a late lunch. We opted to sit outside since it was a fantastic fall day in Las Vegas. We ordered Caesar Salad and a cheese pizza. The salad was very tasty with healthy sized crouton and plenty of cheese. The dressing was not too \"fishy\", in fact, it was very good.   The pizza was cooked great and the crust was the thinnest I have ever had. The pizza was very authentic rustic Italian with lots of sauce and cheese blotted across the pizza.   My only complaint, if I was forced to complain, would be that they served Pepsi products instead of Diet Coke.   The staff was friendly and attentive. The food was good; a little pricey for pizza, but good. The best part was sitting outside and watching all the goofballs thinking they're special walking in and out of Kona Grill next door. Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Ottima pizza margherita con ottima pasta e cottura. Prezzi medio-alti."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's does it again !!! This will be my 3rd review of this magnificent restaurant. Our waiter was Brian. He was one of the best waiters I have ever encountered. He was personable, funny and just all around a great server. I tried the calzone for the first time, because I already know their pizza is awesome and so is the caesar salad. Not a fan of ricotta cheese but I really enjoyed this. We eat at this restaurant more than any place in town. It's also in  a great location, next to Harkins and lots of shopping. I do recommend this place. Thanks Grimaldi's, see you again very soon."}
{"text":"This place for pizza deserves more than 1 star for their food, but the service was the worst I've ever seen!!  So now I've upgraded it because the pizza is really good!  We had been here a yr earlier and the service was poor as well.  First, we got seated right away and the time was about 1:30 pm, so not too busy.  Then it took 20 minutes for a server to come and she had just happened to walk by as our table wasn't hers.   So we ordered right away.  Meanwhile another couple had just been seated and were going over the menu.  Well, their pizza came 10 minutes before ours did!  When we finally got our pizza and started eating, it took 15 minutes to get our servers attn to refill our drinks while she was busy filling others and chatting.  If the pizza wasn't so good...perfect ingredients, the thin crust almost perfect except soft in the middle, we'd be coming here more often!  I'll reevaluate later and give it more stars for their pizza...til then..."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent.  We had a quattro stagioni and a sausage, mushroom onion and they were both amazing.  Mozzarella is top notch, sauce and crust are both solid.  Service was great.  The starters are very lackluster however. The mozzarella in antipasto was cut super thick and is so milky fresh that it doesn't have much flavor.  The salami was also very very lightly seasoned.  The roasted red peppers were pretty good, but nothing to sing about. Skip the starters, stick with the pizza and you'll walk away a happy camper."}
{"text":"Have eaten here 3 times in the past month. 1 meatball and 1 margherita on all visits. Consistently delicious! Love the crust.The cannoli was ok - I wouldn't order again.  With best back again next visit"}
{"text":"Good quality pizza and even better customer service.  Kyle waited on us and was one of the most attentive and pleasant waiters I have been helped by in a long time.  The prices are a bit high or I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"A NYC establishment in Vegas? Sounds familiar. There have been lots of different well known restaurants from all over setting up shop in Vegas. It's like the trendy thing to do now. But anyways having eaten at the OG Grimaldis in New York, I didn't have high expectations that it would nearly as good. It was semi busy for dinner so we just got a large pie to go. They don't offer any of the normal combos like pepperoni or meat lovers or veggie. It's all customizable pizzas or al la carte with you choosing the size and whatever toppings you want. There were 4 of us and we got a large as it's only 2 bucks more than a medium. There were about 10 huge slices so I think it's perfect for a group of 5. We had regular pizza with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese (included) with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni (extra). They said about 15-20 minutes but I believe we waited more like half an hour. Lame, could've walked around more versus waiting in front. But the pizza was hot and delicious. The cheese tasted fresh and was super gooey and each slice had lots of each of the toppings. Again, not as good as what I remember from NY but it hit the spot and it wasn't super pricey - pretty much on spot with what I paid on the east coast."}
{"text":"People are funny when they say this place is real NY pizza from NY and that they ship the water here from NY.  I'm from NYC and you guys here are so gullible.  It may be different but its not the best pizza in the world or maybe it just taste better to you because of the name and they charge you so much for a pizza. I grew up in Brooklyn around the block from a pizza shop and have had may fair share of pizza all over NYC. They must be making the dough different here and the guy maintaining the coal oven and pizza isn't trained properly or oven isn't good.  You are supposed to have a slight smokey coal char flavor, not charred pizza. This style of pizza is only good straight out of oven and has a totally different taste and texture when you take it home to eat or reheat. Its best to eat it there if they get it correct but I have dinned there twice and both times it wasn't great. One time it was flabby and second time it was charred. Service was mediocre"}
{"text":"Saturday night out with the whole gang (five) is not always easy.  Decided to try old town. We were greeted by friendly faces and seated promptly despite the place looking full. Our server was all over it.  My wife and I were sipping drinks and the kids had their drinks within minutes. Food was great. We left happy with full bellies.   Easy dining experience   Definitely on the regular rotation."}
{"text":"Yeah I have written reviews about Grimaldi's...  still the best.  My favorite pizza of all time.  best antipasto (spell check maybe much?) I have ever had.  Love it. Love it. Love it."}
{"text":"Some times you go to a place and it is so awesome you have to find your computer and yelp about it right away. Well..  this is one of those times.  Went there today and had a pizza with sausage and onion.  the Mozarella is dynamic. The sauce is amazing and the crust (thin) was incindiary.  This may have been the the best pizza I have ever had.  I called my friend in jersey right after and told her.  I explained it may be blasphmeny but I think this may be better than any pizza I have had even in NJ.  She hung up on me.  Oh well.  She will be out to visit soon and I will get a chance to show her!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  From the moment we walked in the hostess was attentive and sweet. She was so worried about a child falling and making sure he was okay (talk about awareness of your surroundings) and then we got Caroline as our server. WHAT AN ANGEL.   The caprese salad: delicious  The pizza: THE BEST  the service: this is what brings people back, it was the best.   Shout out to Eric and the crew. You guys are doing customer service right."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, ordered a pepperoni, sausage, and mushroom pizza well done, was absolutely flavorful! Mmmm.... This white sangria also wasn't too far behind. Like the open atmosphere and patio seating."}
{"text":"Good food, good atmosphere. I will be coming here again. 4 stars only because my friends pizza came out 10 minutes after mine did.  Lunch was a great deal. $9.95 combo with salad and choice of pizza or calzone.  I will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Somebody said this was fine mozzarella used on their pizza. I say there is too much of it. I'm never going to remember their tomato-marinara sauce on their pies, because I don't think there was enough of that. The drink list is sub-standard, too. #crabbywhiteguy"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago I never been a fan of chain restaurants. Grimaldi's is the exception to the rule. This place has some of the BEST customer service I have ever experienced and the pizza tickles the taste buds in the most delectable of ways. If you are looking for a great pizza and a home town feel, look no further. The GM Mike was very warm and inviting. If you're looking for a great bartender make sure to see Lindsay and for a vivacious rad server, ask for Tommy. Some of the best staff in town."}
{"text":"COAL FIRED PIZZA!    Pizza that is coal fired is simply amazing!  Unfortunately air pollution laws in California prevent restaurants in California from having coal fired ovens.  The coal makes a total difference.  A nice thin crust that this crispy.  Sauce is great.  I recommend that you add fresh basil to your pizza.  Toppings are tasty and plenty.  I know this is a chain but I had to review it."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza anywhere around.  It is best as just a pepperoni.  The pizza is cooked in a coal oven.  The pepperoni, cheese and sauce are of top quality.  This is a world class pizza.  If you don't like Grimaldi's, you have bad taste or don't like good pizza.  If you are a pizza nut, this is where you belong.  If you are in Tucson and want the best deep dish in the state, go to Rocco's little Italy and get the kitchen sink with some ass burners (it is a hot bread stick, they have a sweet one too)."}
{"text":"I have never in my life had such a delicious pizza, we ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and the one with all kinds of cheeses. The crust was perfect and the sauce was amazing. We visit AZ 1-2x a year to visit friends and this will definitely be one of our new places to come everytime we come to visit. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive to us all!   You all should look into opening a location in Utah! I'd be first in line if you opened a store there!!!!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place.  Ate there 3 days ago and going again tonight with friends.  The good and Service is always good!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Great food, some nicer beers, and a good wine selection as well.  We ordered an antipasto, and a pizza, the food was all incredible, and the pizza was one of the best NY style pizza's I have had in the phoenix area."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's, I love your food, but your customer service is horrible, therefore I am forced to rate you as a 1. Let's take last night as an example. I went to pick up my large pizza and a salad. I saw my pizza come out, I saw two guys opening the box,  looking at the pizza and discussing something. One guys comes over to me, quickly opens the lid and says \"isthisok?\" (yup all in one word.) I said \"uhh yeah, I guess so\"... \"but wait it looks a little small to be a large.\" He says - oh yeah it's between a medium and a large, but we will give you your salad for free. So, if I would have said \"yes, it looks fine,\" they would have left me walk out of there with something less than what I paid for?! Plus now I have a pizza that will not fill up my family? When I ask for a new pizza he grudgingly says \"well its gonna take 20-25 minutes.\" So, I leave... with a small pizza and a crappy wilted salad... and don't expect anyone to hold the door for you either... they are all too busy gabbing around the guest kiosk.  Ps- this is the 2nd time my order was messed up and I must say even Domino's and Pizza Hut have never messed up my pizza size or toppings!"}
{"text":"My family in I LOVE Grimaldi's pizza! I have 2 young kids, so as you can imagine pizza and chicken fingers (nuggets) are a staple. But when it comes to my kids picking where they want to go for dinner. They will always say, \"Grimaldi's!\" At Grimaldi's instead of giving kids crayons and something to color in, they give them a little slice of dough to play with. I'm convinced my kids always pick Grimaldi's for the dough they get to play with, as much as they do the pizza. Speaking of the pizza... Then sliced meatballs as a topping are the BEST!! If you want to pizza you could easily drink a beer or have a glass of wife with, the Grimaldi's is the place. Best pizza in town! Brick oven for the win! Mic drop. :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The best pizza in the Las Vegas/Henderson area; I usually go for lunch and it's not too busy. Servers have been excellent, quality great, sometimes I have seen that toppings were a bit on the lite side but other than that never had any issues. The crust is killer!!! Nice and thin... Not greasy in the least. Their salads are fresh and tasty and well sized. On a busy night, and even at lunchtime occasionally, parking can be a bit nasty but if you order take-out, there is a front space reserved for take out orders. Plus, this place is worth circling the lot a couple times..."}
{"text":"Very, very good. We had a party of three and had no problem getting a table on a week night.  We asked our waiter what he recommended - The Don. So, we ordered a small spinach salad, a large The Don pizza, and a carafe of wine. Overall - fantastic!  The salad was delicious. It had plenty of crispy bacon and yummy Gorgonzola cheese. The Don was very good. With pepperoni, Italian sausage, and meatballs, it was a hearty thin crust pizza. Watch for rolling meatballs! The wine was one we knew - 19 Crimes. It is a delicious and smooth red blend. Top notch dinner!  Our waiter was pleasant and attentive. I observed all waitstaff hustling tables. The noise got louder as the place filled. Towards the end of dinner it was full and very loud! I thought this would make a good first date location, but not when busy.   Good: the large pizza is really large. The wine bottle chandeliers were fun!  Bad: noise level when the place is busy."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today.  Delicious pizza, simply made.  The red sangria was good.  The personal pizza definitely feeds two, so in my opinion this places is very reasonably priced.  Once I try the cheesecake, if it's as good as they say, I might change my review to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The pizza taste just like pizza in  New York .  It has a thin crust  and they cook it in the brick oven. The sauce is so full of flavor.  It is hard to find good pizza anywhere outside of New York but this is the best I have had so far.. Im craving it right know. I usually get the pepperoni or add hot peppers to it.."}
{"text":"Came here for the free birthday pizza,sat at the high top near the bar, was greeted by our server... and then we never saw her again.... I had to hunt down a server to ask on out pizza.  Food was real good though and the bartender and manager were nice. We would go again."}
{"text":"Usually love the pizza here but this time it seemed like the chefs were watching the world series instead of the pizza. There was very little toppings and we were overtaken by the tasted of burnt crust and dust. Hope to never get a pizza like that one again"}
{"text":"As far as pizza and deals go, this is some of the best i've ever seen.  it was so good that my friends and I went two days in a row.  They serve New York style pizzas, I think a large, which should fill up 2 people very comfortably if not 3, cost $16.  Most veggie toppings are $2 extra, some are $4.    We got a large pizza with mushrooms and onions, I had 2 and a half slices.  I was pretty full, but I would've eaten more just because it tasted so good.  The sauce was amazing, tangy and slightly sweet, crust was crunchy, and I could taste the toppings.  I've been to Vegas several 6 times in the past year and a half, and this is one of the best food deals I've come across.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Grimaldi's every time I've been in NYC, but never made the trek down to Brooklyn. I'm not sure how this compares to the original, but it's certainly one of the best pizza places now in Las Vegas. It's not the best or the cheapest pizzas I've ever eaten but it's probably one of the better pizzas I've eaten in Vegas (even sober, because yes, even cardboard, oily pizza tastes great at 4 am when you're drunk). It's on the expensive side and probably 50-70% more expensive than you should really be paying for pizza, but that's usually how it goes in Vegas.  I was sad that The Pizza Spot @ The Wynn closed, but this is way better and less greasy with a better selection of toppings. I've also eaten at the Secret Pizza spot (at the Cosmo), which is also good, especially if you only want a single slice, but it's definitely greasier and has limited toppings.  This is tucked away upstairs in the Palazzo and wasn't crowded at all when I came on a Sunday evening at 6 pm. I had a hard time deciding what to order as there were too many combinations of toppings to pick from (around 20: pepperoni, italian sausage, mushrooms, extra basil) and 3 different sauces - the traditional tomato sauce, white garlic sauce, or pesto. I asked the server what was popular or good, and he was not very helpful (telling me he disliked garlic and that I had to decide on my own).  The way they price the pizza and toppings is odd. The personal pizza, 12 inches, is $9 for the base (just dough, tomato and cheese), and the small pizza is 16 inches and $14, and the large is 18 inches and $16. I don't know why they don't have a medium size, or why they didn't just make a small, medium and large - probably so the people dining solo didn't feel awkward for ordering an entire \"small\" pizza for just themselves. If you want the white with garlic, add on $1 or $2 depending on the size of the pizza. The price of the toppings is odd, either $2 (mushrooms, garlic, olives, spinach, ham, extra cheese, extra basil, italian sausage, meatballs) or $4 (sausage, sun dried tomatoes). I don't know why extra basil is the same price as italian sausage, why garlic or jalapeños are $2 each, and why sun-dried tomatoes are $4. Just close your eyes, order and know that your bill (like everything else in Vegas) will be expensive.  I got the italian sausage and mushroom personal pizza. I could have done with just half the pizza, but ended up eating it all (I figured I already had done a number on my body in Vegas, so why not just continue the bad decisions). The crust was delicious and thin, and not burnt. The tomato sauce was the right amount and it was not overly cheesy (the cheese also seemed fresh and high-quality), nor did they skimp on the toppings. All in all, once I started eating, I couldn't stop - it was delicious.  It wasn't the fastest pizza - from the time I ordered to when I got the pizza, it was probably 30 min or so. It was on the expensive side ($17 for a small pizza), but not outrageously priced for Vegas, and it was one of the better pizzas I've had in Vegas. I'll definitely be back here next time I stay at Wynn or Encore and need some carbs to soak up the alcohol or a fairly-inexpensive casual meal. Come with at least 2 people so you don't have to eat an entire pizza by yourself.  You can also order pizza and pick it up, which is a nice option if you are too hungover to leave your room and have a nice friend who will come pick it up for you."}
{"text":"Great service tonight. We had a Cesar salad and pizza tonight!  The taste of the sauce and meat is what we liked and it made our taste buds water! Lots of eyes candy!"}
{"text":"Omfg this pizza was good. New York style. Thin crust, delicious toppings and very easy on the wallet compared to other eateries in Vegas. The pizzas are huge! Watermelon salad is refreshing. House chianti is amazing. If you're in Vegas and want good pizza this is the place."}
{"text":"yassss the pizza here is very tasty love the dough, the sauce, and the toppings i was recovering from a back injury and the pizza actually cheered me up so grimaldi's :)"}
{"text":"The Pizza is exactly I like it. If you like the New York style pizza this place is for you. I took the smallest \"don\" and even it is enough for two."}
{"text":"GOOD: + Smart hosts with good table distribution. The packed Friday evenings I've gone, there's never been more than a 20 minute wait to be seated. + Wide variety of pizzas. You get a lot more choice here than many other small family owned chains. + Nice atmosphere. From the woodtype stove to the NYC subway signs, red checkered table cloths, and wooden decor, it feels like a pizza shop. + The pizza tastes fantastic.  MEH: - The pizza took about 30 minutes to get to us. Other authentic, personal pizzerias (Settebello's, Balboa), took about half that much time.  TLDR: The pizza is competitively priced for its quality and the staff makes the dining experience smooth. Sometimes it takes a while to get the pizza to you."}
{"text":"Our waitress was too busy with 3 tables and a large group. She forgot to put one of our orders in, which was disappointing for our kids. The pizza was good. Would not come back to this location, too busy if you are looking for good service."}
{"text":"I used to love Grimaldi's pizza, but my last experience was shockingly bad. The pizza I was served was lacking any real flavor and just bland at best. Plus, they stopped serving Tabasco sauce. It's a pizza place, how do you not carry Tabasco???"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. The crust and sauce are delicious. Loved the fresh mozzarella. Service was great. The manager even offered to serve our pizza. I heated up a slice the next day on the stove and it was still great."}
{"text":"Not great. The pizza was okay and the service was terrible. The waitress tried to be polite to make up for it but it didn't justify the incredibly long wait for everything. They were NOT super busy and we waited over 30 minutes for our one small pizza we ordered. We sat and watched guests who arrived 15 minutes later than us receive their food before us. It took so long for the waitress to take the check after we put our card with it that I had to get up and ask another employee to run our card. It wasn't until then that our waitress decided to end her personal conversation and do her job."}
{"text":"Once we went to Grimaldi's in Hoboken, NJ and weren't all that impressed.  Yet the first time we ate at this Grimaldi's, we were blown away!    Upon entering, you are enveloped by the aroma of pizza baking in a coal-fired oven.  This is swoon-inducing---and I mean that in a good way.  The smell almost has you believing that you are in a pizza joint with a coal-fired oven in the Northeast.  When ordering pizza baked in a coal-fired oven, I like to get a plain cheese pizza.  IMO, this is the best way to fully taste the sauce, cheese and crust without anything else get in the way.    There's nothing like a thin crust pizza from a coal-fired oven with that char on the crust.  The crust has just the right balance of crispy and soft.  The sauce is well flavored with proper proportions of basil and oregano.  The amount of cheese is just right.  I love to savor each and every bite.  There is more to this Grimaldi's than the one under the Brooklyn Bridge.  This one has other items in addition to the pizza.  We like their antipasto.  It has sliced mozzarella which is fresh and creamy, black and green olives (the black ones are pitted, the green ones have pits in them),  roasted red pepper slices which are bursting with flavor, and a good, flavorful salami.  Everytime we're in AZ, it is so worth it to us to deal with the heavy traffic in Old Town Scottsdale to dine at Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. Not quite NYC good. But for Vegas, it was real good. It's located in the Palazzo, which was nice and convenient for us.  I really want to give it 4 stars for the pizza. The service was slow. Our waiter never came to check on us until after the pizza arrived. It took long too, which was surprising considering how empty it was.  In addition to subpar service, the bathroom was a hot mess. They need to keep it clean. It's in a fancy hotel and should not look like it belongs in the streets of Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Been to the NY location and this one stacks up fairly well. Pizza and service were fantastic! Went here with a group of friends who had never been to NY and they said this was the best pizza they ever had. It was pretty darn close."}
{"text":"Located inside the Fashion Show mall.  If you open something up in a location like the Fashion Show mall you better be prepared to dish out the goods.  Both locals and tourists come and go so your product will either keep you in business or drive you out.  But Grimaldi's Pizza is darn good.    I was with a friend and when she smelled pizza in the air she all of a sudden wanted to sit down and eat.  There's another pizza place here, California Pizza Kitchen, which is good as well.  But we've never had Grimaldi's before so we decided to sit down here and try it out.  So come to find out we'll be dining a New York pizza.  I've had a Chicago pizza so I was curious to see how it competes with a New York style pizza.    We shared a small white w/garlic pizza ($16) and added mushrooms ($2), pepperoni ($2), and artichoke hearts ($4).  A $25 pizza split between two people is not bad at all if you're saving money for shopping.  There had to be at least 20 toppings so have your go with it.  Secret to a good pizza however is the sauce and cooking method.  The sauce was delicious and the coal burning method (love wood burning as well) worked perfectly.  Our pizza was delicious, I just don't know what makes this a New York pizza.  Service was good but it took so long for our pizza to come out and it wasn't even busy inside.  Our quick dine wasn't so quick.  Do come and have a pizza!"}
{"text":"These folks ARE as good as it gets. I may have to return just to visit them. Food cherry on the sundae"}
{"text":"It was a while since I went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria so forgive me if this review is a bit late.  The O.G. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is located in NYC, and is legendary in those parts as being one of the best places to get a slice.  In fact, the one time I was in NYC and had plans to eat there, the line was out the door.  Needless to say we missed the boat on that one.    But luckily, even though it's not location #1 there's a Grimaldi's here in good old Las Vegas.  NY pizza?  Made in coal burning brick oven?  There's nothing like it.  Definitely a step above your chains like the Hut, Dom's, or Papa's.  No offense against Chicago, but I love a slice of NY pie.  No deep dish here at Grimaldi's, just yummy thin crust!  Crisp, a nice burnt edge, clean and tasty.  I could eat an entire pie by myself if given the opportunity.  Grimaldi's has a great menu, somewhat typical of what you would find in a pizza joint.  But simplified.  No chicken fingers or intricate pasta dishes here.  Just pizza, calzones, and salads on the main menu.  And I like it!  Simple is good, as long as you do it right.  The wifey and I shared a date night out and had a great meal.  We started with the Grimaldi's House salad - romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, and mixed with the house vinaigrette.  Good starter - fresh, light, and flavorful with a good kick from the vinaigrette.    For our pizza, we went for a large Grimaldi's seasonal special - The Buffalo Chicken.  It was a pie topped with grilled chicken breast, Buffalo sauce, mozzarella cheese, and bleu chesse crumbles.  Cooked till the crust and top was a golden bubby brown this pizza was pretty scrumptious.  Cheesy and melty, with a spicy punch, and a healthy crunch.  Not bad for a non-traditional pizza.  Next time though I think I might stick with something more Italian, maybe a straight up cheese, or a Margheria with cheese, fresh tomato, and basil.    Pizzas range from $12 - $16 for an entire pie, with toppings coming in at an additional cost each.  Specialty pies will cost in the $20 - $22 range since they come with a range of toppings included.  Calzones come in around the $10 - $18 range depending on what size you get.  Salads are a good deal coming in small or large sizes at prices from $9 - $11.  You can get away with a decent meal for around $40 after tax and tip.  OK for a date night.  Grimaldi's even does pizzas to go, and they come in a fancy box!  So in case you don't want to stay, feel free to call in an order, pick up, and go.  Pizza Pizza!  Wait...wrong chain."}
{"text":"I've had mostly good experiences here. 8 times out of ten, things are perfect.  But there are those couple occasions where the pizza is a bit too \"charred tasting\" or not quite right.  Now, I absolutely appreciate the management taking a proactive role in correcting things, but , the time from correction to my mouth seems to take too long.  I really hate to give them 4 stars, because when it's right, the place deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Rita was an excellent waitress. She was extremely friendly and helped with explaining the menu since it was our first visit. The pizza was outstanding! The staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This location has great food. Really enjoyed the caprese salad. The pizzas were really good too! The drinks were my favorite part though and the bartenders were amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is over-rated!  Took my family and out of town guest here and were totally disappointed in the food and service. They placed us in a small room with two large parties and we couldn't here ourselves think!  The waitress didn't help us much in deciding what to put on our pizza. Talked really fast and would run off. The menu stinks.  They should have some pizzas to choose from then to have us waste our time trying to decide which ingredients would be good together.    The pizza was just OK...I've had better at Peter Piper's and at half the cost!  Also, we didn't want any meat on our pizza since I'm vegetarian, but there were pieces of sausage on it.  That makes you wonder about how sanitary their kitchen is.  I decided to take my time to email through their website to tell them about our experience and got an email saying they would be in touch shortly...well it's been over a week and no apology, NOTHING. This place knows nothing about service. Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"A repeat restaurant for our family.  Everyone loves it and whenever the grandkids really want to have pizza, they want Grimaldis.  This time, we enjoyed the pesto thin crust and a simple pepperoni pie.  both were scruptous and we even spoiled the little munchkins with the sampler desert (canoli, tiramisu, cheesecake) but the pizza is the reason we will return often.  Service was very attentive without being distractive.  Only comment on this visit was the (new?) manager at the hostess desk who, after hearing our request for a table to seat 4, never looked up and acknowledged us again.  The seating hostess arrived and promptly re-effected the good service we were used to."}
{"text":"My parents and I love this place. We go here whenever we have a craving for pizza we come here. My dad and I love the Pesto Pizza with garlic and mushrooms. it's so yummy! everyone always looks over at us and wonders why our pizza is green and always asks us what it is. The employees are nice and I love the atmosphere when I eat outside, especially on a beautiful night! :)"}
{"text":"We walked in and sat down, looked at the menu and walked out.  The menu is very limited and for those people who do not like thin crust pizza, there are NO other options.  Not to mention the prices were ridiculous."}
{"text":"We love the pizza here and we come here all the time. It's a great place to get a salad, nice pizza, and some wine and I would most definitely recommend it. The service is generally pretty good and the ambiance is casual. It's a really nice place and we always look forward to coming here. On weekends it can have a pretty long wait so it's always helpful to make reservations."}
{"text":"Been to and have eaten Grimaldis pizza a few times and it is good. But not my style of pizza and a bit more expensive. I did have a fresh calzone last week that blew me away though. So simple.....dough, ricotta and mozzerella cheese. It was so good, i couldn't dip it in the sauce. It was memorable....  :)"}
{"text":"We met some friends here for lunch during the week.  The location is like a resort--just beautiful.  The pizza was amazing, and it was a relaxing setting to catch up with old friends.  And I was delighted to see they have some locations in Texas--hooray!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, no doubt. Caprese Salad was probably my favorite. For some reason, they wanted to keep me out of the main restaurant area, even though it was basically empty: \"Would you like to sit at the bar, the patio, out here in the hall\"... really weird, I know I need a haircut, but come on! A little expensive for a personal pizza ($15) but I'd do it again."}
{"text":"Great homemade pizza. The prices are fairly low and the food is highly competitive with the other pizza places. I can say that their pizza is exactly as shown on the menu, looks great the taste amazing. Highly recommended for anyone who looking for a different kind of pizza, a better one."}
{"text":"Seated fast, service was great, pizza was cooked just right, crust was great. Would defiantly recommend,, and you can't beat the price !"}
{"text":"This is a nice Italian/pizzeria. The service was very good and so was the food. This is a very large place with a wood burning pizza oven. We ordered a cheese pizza with extra sauce along with a Mediterranean salad. Both were very good. I would return."}
{"text":"I had some drinks & pizza here on 6/28/12.  I was here on a Thursday, and this place was PACKED & INSANE!  It was pretty much elbow-room only.  Not much privacy, and the atmosphere was very loud.    The service was excellent, but the food was VERY expensive for what you are getting.  Thin-crust pizza was tasty, but very well-done & crispy/crunchy.  Some may like it this well-done, and some may not.  The bathrooms are VERY small (single person - Lock door behind you).  This absolutely DOES NOT go with the capacity at which the restaurant was at.  Expect a wait if you have to pee.  I may or may not come back."}
{"text":"Great Spinach Salad, Ceasar Salad & pizza. Service was excellent as well. Waiter was helpful and very kind. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"So amazing! We stop here to eat everytime we are in Vegas. Always have amazing food. This time we had amazing food AND excellent service. Our waitress brought the kids raw pizza dough for the kids to play while the food arrived. She also helpled us figure out how to use UBER!"}
{"text":"Typically prefer to make pizza at home, but when we want to go out for pizza, this is the place we hit. I've been to NYC several times, and Grimaldi's in AZ is pretty close to the same quality you get in NYC. They never fail to hit the mark. Crust is very thin and crispy, and sauce and toppings they use don't make you feel heavy on the stomach after a few pieces!  There's usually a wait list during dinner on the weekends, so best to make a reservation beforehand if you prefer not to wait!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKED! I had the huge \"personal\" calzone for lunch. It was the best I have ever had. The ricotta cheese was perfect, nice and soft, as was the dough. I loved the thick-cut pepperoni and the red sauce was incredible.   You lose a star because you serve PEPSI! Why is Las Vegas such a Pepsi town? Pepsi is crap!!!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza place in Las Vegas! I love New York-style thin crust pizza and they dough, sauce and toppings are fantastic. I used to live in New York, and this quality of the pizzas here is definitely on par with the better NY places. It can get a bit pricey, especially when you start to load on toppings like I always do, but well worth it! I have been to this location multiple times and have always found the staff to be friendly and curteous. Better service than the location at Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Legit pizza with that brick oven taste! See if they have any specialty pizzas in season as you may get a white pizza from time to time.   Pricing is very fair and they have a nice patio and in door/outdoor bar area. Go in spring or summer to enjoy the breeze on the patio!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about grimaldis and went to this location after Christmas shopping.  It was pretty empty.  We were seated right away and had a male and female server who doubled as the hostess.   The menu is small, which I like. There are three pizzas to choose from in a large or small and then you can choose your own toppings.  My friend and I just ordered a mushroom pizza to split and a caprese salad.  The salad was good, but I can't imagine how you'd go wrong making that. They give you salt, oil, and balsamic on the side. It was a good portion and shareable at $8.   Our pizza was served shortly after.  The woman served our first slice and we ate the whole large between the two of us.  The crust is very thin, the cheese was very good, the mushrooms were fresh, and the sauce was just right.  It was a very good pizza. They found a very good recipe for their proportions and ratios of cheese versus sauce versus crust.  The only thing that didn't make this a 5 star review is that:  1. They never refilled our drinks until we asked when leaving. Sure he offered a to go cup, but it want busy because he had a bite of food from an off the clock employee's food while he was on the clock but that's beside the point. 2. A customer leaving broke a wine glass just by putting his jacket on. Although they handled the situation well to make the customer not feel at fault.. They said don't worry it happens all the time.. First they shouldn't keep wine glasses on the table no matter how nice it makes the table setting look since their tables are so close together. Second the staff said it happens all the time and not to worry. It just feels dangerous, uncomfortable for who ever did it, and could be avoided. I hope it doesn't happen all the time for safety reasons.    I'd return to try their special mozzarella and meats on a more adventurously topped pizza, but maybe not this location."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by when they first openned we wanted pizza and it was the first place we came across.  We feel in love with the place. the salads are big enough for 2 to 3 people and delicous. The pizza was strange looking only because I am use to pizza with cheese all over. this cheese is in spots and doesn't cover the whole pizza. Once you bite into the pizza you will melt. It is by far the best pizza we have had EVER!  There desserts are also spetacular. We have gone back many times and have had a very postive experieince. the only bad thing is they get extremely busy at dinner time up to and hour and half wait. It's well worth the wait. The best time to go is at lunch time there is never any waits."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is definitely one of my go-tos in the area. It falls into the \"night out\" category for me instead of the \"pizza to go\" category. The ambiance inside is nice and the service is pretty good, so you feel ok sitting in there and hanging out for a while with a couple beers and a pie, unlike, say, Giovanni's up the road.  Main point: I really like the pizza. Nice thin crust, so you don't feel like you're taking in 3000 calories (I'm not saying you're not....you may be...it just doesn't feel like it). The cheese is (I think) mozzarella, so it has a really good flavor that is different from your typical take out place. All the toppings are really good and seem pretty high quality. The side salads are also really good.  One star off for the high prices and (like others have noted) the fact that you can't order a specialty pizza. Instead, you have to get a large ($18 for cheese I think) and then add on your toppings at $2-4 each. If you get 4 or 5 toppings, you're looking at like $30+ for a pizza. But hey, that's another reason why I say this is a \"night out\" place and not a \"pizza to go\" place."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Phoenix. Low on the grease index which I prefer. Not loaded with cheese and good sauce"}
{"text":"Sat at curb-side to-go for over 20 minutes. No one came outside to even check or get our payment. When we finally went inside the bartender wasn't very friendly. Gave them 3 because the hostess was so sweet and held our door for us."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE the curbside pick up feature!! I always order the same thing from here, pepperoni pizza, Cesar salad, and seasonal cheesecake. This time it was the Butterscotch Toffee flavor! It was super tasty, with heath bar topping! I am a fan of Grimaldi's. If I am in the area and can drive over to pick up I am a happy girl! It is my favorite pizza in town!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!! Everything is made with fresh, top notch ingredients. The staff is very friendly, they definitely aim to please. We have had several different pizza combinations and also their calzones and have never been disappointed. I\"m not a cheesecake fan but they have a specialty cheesecake each month that has been nothing but pure delight every time I've tried it. If you want deep dish pizza this is not the spot for you. Thin crust is the only thing they serve here. Give them a shot. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, our server was very good. She explained everything about this place from history to how the pizza is made. Very sweet server we had. Food came out fast. Nothing to complain about only that its a little pricey... for a pizza. I loved the decor of the place. The wine bottles as chandler."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is the best pizza in AZ if you ask me. I LOVE thin crust & the flavor is just so amazing. We had never been to the Ray Rd location until now & it was just as good as the others. We had a birthday pizza - and added some toppings to it. Also, HH is good for drinks - they have great Italian wines. We also got the bruschetta for the first time & it was amazing."}
{"text":"LOVE Grimaldi's! We came for my boyfriend's birthday because when you sign up online for your bday you get a free large pizza, awesome perk! We got there around 6:30 on Friday night and they said the wait was 35 min so we sat at the bar and got a bottle of wine (Louis Martini cab) but the wait only ended up being like 15 min. We sat down in the dining room and its very loud in there, lots of families and kids, but no big deal. I just wouldn't recommend coming here for like a fancy date night. We started with the Mediterranean salad, a small is a perfect size for 2 or even 3 people, we didn't even finish it. Then we got a large pepperoni pizza and added meatballs. It was so delicious, & we ended up taking half home."}
{"text":"I'm really confused about the reviews below.  Grimaldi's is not necessarily deserving of the Worlds' Greatest Pizza Award; however, it's damn good pizza.  It's even better that in $$$cottsdale you can have a dinner for two with multiple glasses of wine for under  $40.  We ordered the simple pepperoni pie, and my hungry boyfriend an I did not leave a slice on the stone.  The inside is decked out with red and white checkered table cloths with an open kitchen to see the creation.  There is also an outdoor seating area that I unfortunately did not get to see but heard great things and plan to go back to experience.  Pizza is hard to screw up, but it's even harder to find delicious pizza.  I can't speak for the other items on the menu, but if you're looking for a cheap date night out pizza style, I recommend Grimaldi's, hands down."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is without a doubt a 5-star restaurant in my book. I am a loyal customer, and I rave over the pepperoni, ricotta & extra sauce - I encourage all rookies & pros to give it a whirl.  The ricotta is divine & truly takes it to the next level.  Not only does the food speak for itself, but the service is outstanding.  I am currently at this Grimaldi's location & the pizza didn't live up to the Grimaldi's expectation.  Without hesitation the manager has taken our pizza & made us a new one that surpasses the Grimaldi's status, all with a smile on his face.  Make sure Grimaldi's is part of on your regular stops in Old Town! You won't be disappointed when dining with the best pizza in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I recently had lunch with a friend here. She lives by another Grimaldi's and raves about the food, but that location is too far for a workday lunch...   We started with sangria. It was not premade as any good sangria is, so the flavors of the wine and fruit can blend. Speaking of fruit, that was lacking as well. I am used to sangria having pieces of fruit that one can eat, this just had sliced of orange and lemon that should have been used as garnish only.  We split a small caesar salad, the small was enough to feed two ladies that are trying to watch their figure (sorta!) but for heavy eaters it may not be enough to split.  Also split a small pizza, half white with no toppings and the other have red with mushrooms. The pizza was cooked perfectly, I love the thin and crispy crust. I really enjoyed the delicious garlic flavor of white side, which had the perfect amount of cheese. However, the other side did very little for me.. I just didn't care for the flavor of the red sauce.  I still would like to go back and give the pesto style pizza a try. Won't waste money or calories on the sangria. For the time being I can not justify anymore then a 3 star rating, but I won't be the least bit surprised if I find myself updating this review to add another star after another visit or two."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many many times since I moved to Las Vegas.  Hands-down this is my favorite pizza in town.  I always bring out-of-town guests here because I think the food is great and different from most pizza places.  This place is not close to where I live but I go out of my way to get pizza here and it's worth it.  Last night, the BF and I were meeting his aunt and uncle on that side of town, so I kindly offered to bring over some Grimaldi's. Yeah!  Pretty much always order the same thing, but last night I skipped the mediterannean sald I normally order and got two pizzas:  1. mush, meatball, kalmata olives 2. sundried tomatoes, pepperoni, kalmata olives  Seriously, if you like kalmata olives, make sure you get some on your pizza.  Before Grimaldi's I had never had them on a pizza.  Now I'm addicted.  I've tried the white pizza, but I'm not a fan of alfredo.  The pesto sauce is excellent, but I like red sauce on my pizzas.  I haven't even mentioned the staff.  Everyone is really cool and friendly.  I would probably still come here if the staff were a-holes, but fortunately, they're not!"}
{"text":"Terrible, and I mean terrible service, waiter took our order after Restaurant got packed!  Our food took 2 hours, and the waiter's excuse, just refill our drinks like 10 times!  Luckily food was very good, but seriously, not worth two hours!"}
{"text":"Still a classic been to the original in NY the one in the Woodlands in Texas and now Gilbert AZ. Just glad this is close by to have in the rotation."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had.  Love the crisp thin crust."}
{"text":"Finally figured out that the awesome bartender's name is Kurt!  Ordered a pizza to go and when we got there to pick it up the hostess forgot to put the order in.  We were totally content to sit at the bar for a glass of wine while we waited for our pizza, but Kurt's customer service went above and beyond.  He hooked us up with dessert and comped our pizza!  Totally unexpected and not necessary but this type of customer service is rare these days!  Love Grimaldi's even more now, especially with employees like Kurt who rock!"}
{"text":"If you're visiting Grimaldi's, you're most likely coming from some tasty thin crust pizza.  Time to give this location a shout out  Service:  Very friendly team members throughout my visits.  From the hostess to the server, this location has been consistently on point.  My servers have always been great with keeping the drinks fresh, getting the order correct and to the table quickly.  The manager stopped by our table twice to make sure our dining experience was going well.  I really appreciated the extra effort and attention.  Pizza: '12 regular with pepperoni and sausage is my go to and takes care of my pizza cravings when it pops up. Sauce is always rich but never overwhelming.  The thin crust is and the cheesey cheese  compliment each other well.  I've been to numerous Grimaldi's locations and I've always been happy that their high quality pizzas are consistent  When I'm feeling a little healthy af with my pizza outing, the salads have always been fresh.  This particular location can get busy quickly but they staff has always been on point with great service and turning covers over quickly without rushing patrons.  This is a great pizza spot when you're looking for casual pizza sit down night.  Keep up the great work Eastern Grimaldi's team!  Until next time.... =)"}
{"text":"So...this place came highly recommended by my restauranteur friend A.Minn. Wow. Big mistake. The servers here were outstanding. Personable and attentive. The pizzas? Oh boy the pizzas! They sucked. Plain and simple. Do you like soggy and disgusting crust? Well, we ordered a pizza with mushrooms and cheese with red sauce. The dough was so soggy and gross that we were gonna ask for the huge Asian pho spoons to spoon that gloop up. We also ordered a white pizza with artichokes and chicken. The chicken was dry and flavorless. The dough was not soggy like the other pizza. But it was equally as dry. So, I would say. This Vegas location was bad. Tasted like the first day of culinary school. Cafeteria spaghetti and meatballs."}
{"text":"Great place and wonderful service from Dayna.  My buddy Anthony from Daylight pool recommended this joint and it was pretty dang good"}
{"text":"Yummy food (we got pepperony/tomato/garlic pizza), nice servers and a lovely atmosphere. It was a little odd that we had to circle the restaurant to use the restroom, but that's not their fault. Spent $21 on a pizza we split between the two of us, and there would've been some left over... but we were hungry. I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here solo for lunch and was seated right away.  My server Kayleigh was great with suggestions.  Food came fast and the pizza was wonderful.  If I get back to Scottsdale I will be eating here again."}
{"text":"The pizza here was delicious!! Pluses are that the crust was perfectly crisp and the ingredients were fresh and you could taste it. Freshness does come at a cost though, and this place can hit you in the wallet if you let it."}
{"text":"Coming in here, immediately great service from the start.  their menu has it all with all the toppings you want.   Only thing i would say they need more selection on their appetizers. The main thing i loved about this place is how super kid friendly this place is.  My friend brought her 1 year old daughter to this place.  By the time we got to our table, they already had a high chair set up.  When they took our orders, they also where considerate about the little ones well being with giving her her own sealable cup AND to keep her busy they gave her her own dough in a pan to play with.  Seriously!  You can't get this anywhere. When our pizza arrived, the server served us pure slices into our plates, with all the condiments we wanted.  The desert selection was very good and tasty.  You can tell the cooks put alot of heart into their food. Overall great food, great environment, definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Friday night, and opted to sit at the bar instead of waiting 15 minutes for a table. The bartender was more than friendly and quick to take our order. The best part of the pizza was the brick-oven char on the bottom of the crust- mmmmmmm.   The menu was limited (pretty much just salads, pizza, and dessert), but that's all you really need at a pizza joint, right? The atmosphere was nice- looks like they were going for a more upscale atmosphere with the white linen napkins and small dining area. It all works together well and I enjoyed my dining experience, but not sure I loved it enough to head back here over my other favorite pizza places."}
{"text":"This place is literally just OK.  Service is just OK.  Pizza was just OK (needs more cheese for sure, and was a bit soggy).  I would rather just go to Brio around the corner.  Food there is much more flavorful."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, considering we are in Arizona.  By far one of the best pizza joints out here.  Food and atmosphere were great and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The food was delicious  the staff was great. Loved the decorc and music,  classy place."}
{"text":"The best margherita pizza I have ever eaten. I wish we had a Grimaldi's in Utah. There is nothing in Utah that even comes close to Grimaldi's. I've searched. They are great with kids, too. They give them some pizza dough to play with while we wait. I love, love, love Grimaldi's. Their ingredients are quality, which is important to me since I am semi-vegan. Theirs is the only cheese I'll eat."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is without a doubt my favorite pizza ever. I wish we had one in Utah. I've search for comparable pizza to no avail. I go to the AZ or Vegas locations whenever I can. I just get the cheese pizza, but it's more like margherita since it's made with fresh mozz slices. Love, love, love thin crust pizza. I went to Chicago and realized how much I dislike thick crust pizza (Lou Manalti's) and it further confirmed that there isn't a better pizza than Grimaldi's. I did eat at John's in NYC a few times when I was a teen, but I don't remember if I loved it or not."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has great pizza. It has great service.  Do the white garlic pizza with ricotta and meatballs. That's the ticket.  Also, we had, I believe her name was Karen, as her server. She was so sweet. Checked in consistently without being annoying. That's a big plus.   Definitely get some pizza here. It's worth it."}
{"text":"Very tasty thin crust pizza...I was actually a little surprised how good this was.  Our set of three guys got a sausage, pepperoni and mushroom large; it would have been too little food for three younger athletic types, but for three shlubs, it was perfect, in part because we ordered a tasty large caesar salad to go with it.  The toppings on the pizza were great; the pepperoni slices in particular were excellent.  Our server and a manager were around a few times in-between bringing the food/drinks to chat, which is always a nice touch for someone like myself who visits a new town and likes to chat up the locals.  The text message system was perfect for our wait time; we put in our name and were told it would be 45-50 minutes, so I cheated back to the HoJo on Indian School for a little while and when the text came in, hauled back to the restaurant to make our seating.  I'll be back the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"Way too expensive, the pizza is decent but hello, it is dough, sauce and cheese.. why the hell is it so expensive?? We ordered 2 pizza's and a salad with a few soda's and it was OUCH $80 before tipping!! The same pizza with less atmosphere at Bella would cost $40-$50..."}
{"text":"if you want the best new york/american pizza look no further! the toppings are amazing and the cheese is to die for....on the other hand, if you want the best \"italian\" pizza go to Settebello's"}
{"text":"I wish they had other options beside pizza and salads, but I guess that's what you can expect given their name. The pizza was great! The salad was pretty average...nothing too special. Our waiter was pretty funny and on top of it, which made the experience much more enjoyable. It's a little pricey for pizza, but we split everything so it made it more affordable."}
{"text":"I ordered online for pick up.  My two pizzas were handed to me, and without checking the boxes, I left.  When I got home, I opened the boxes to find my traditional cheese pizza with EXTRA cheese had hardly any cheese at all!  Also, the dough bubbles on the crust were burned BLACK.  I drove back and requested a new pizza.  The manager brought it out 15 minutes later, and that was it.  No consideration about driving back and forth for a pizza that should have been right the first time.  For what it's worth, the other pizza was fine.  I will not be returning, though.  For the money they're asking, customer service should be better."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza place I had in awhile salad was nice and fresh. For the pizza I went with the meatball and pepperoni pizza oh my God I destroyed the whole pizza When I visit Vegas again I will come back def"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in the area.  Traditional red or white pizzas are both excellent choices.  Salads are good too."}
{"text":"I have been to several of their locations in and out of Arizona.  One is as good as the next Grimaldi's.  They all take me back to my days in NYC!   A good place to go!  I have found they have good food and good service.  This seems to be consistent from visit to visit.    I would recommend that you give this place a try because I think you will enjoy it.  When you go in - tell them that Chris from Yelp recommended you go there.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but it might provide some interesting entertainment and a good laugh or two!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I know a lot of people now a days are against chains, but this is one you should definitly get behind.  Ive never had a bad experience here. The service is always fast, and nice.  The pizzas are great, and the cheesecakes, which change often, are oh so worth the bloated \"ate way too much\" feeling afterwards. My husband recommends the Heath bar one, while Im a cheesecake purist: classic w/ strawberries & chocolate drizzle.  They have a great beer selection and its a perfect place for a Sat. lunch between errands, or a dinner w/ friends."}
{"text":"Pizzas was great, but when I was done eating my salad I grabbed my plate and there was a huge piece of old pizza stuck to my plate. Like really very gross and the sad thing is the manager didn't offer anything strait garbage. Last time I come to this location?"}
{"text":"We love Grimaldi's located in Scottsdale Quarter. This location is usually pretty busy during the evenings on weekends, so you might want to make a reservation. Hint: sign up for their email club to receive a free pizza (up to an $18 value) for your birthday. We typically order their 18\" pizza with meatballs. The taste is amazing right out of the oven. However, their crust is quite hard and doesn't contain much flavor. I really enjoy their Oreo Cheesecake."}
{"text":"Always have a wonderful time here. Our server Erica was friendly and accommodating. Pizza is so delicious. Nice beer selection and good atmosphere. On a nice day like today, they have the bar open to the outside. They changed the station to the dbacks game on our request. Will be back. Best lunch in San tan."}
{"text":"Brian and his staff are hands down the BEST you can find anywhere! The food is always fresh, delicious, and served timely.  Everyone is polite, professional, and pleasant. The atmosphere is fun and upbeat like one would expect from a pizzeria. If your are looking for a 'go to' pizza place in N. Scottsdale, Brian and his staff will treat you right.  Lance & Sammi"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a pizza place that is far above average, then this is the place to go. The pizza crust is perfectly crispy with the right amount of sauce and toppings. The toppings won't fall all over the place either. There's something special about the sauce, too. Overall, this is the best pizza I've had, and I'd drive or fly to Vegas just to have it again! If you're in Vegas and craving pizza, definitely try Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"I usually contact the GM, or owner prior to writing a bad review... but they didn't answer when I called THREE TIMES SO HERE I GO!!!! So sad bkz I've been enjoying GRIMALDI's for years!!! Now that I live in Phoenix, I was super excited to know that we also have them here..... key word, WAS!!!! Stay away from the Peoria location, y'all!! The service was absolutely awful!!! We were not greeted with a smile let alone any kindness! We decided to eat at the bar, since the ProBowl game was on, and you usually get better service at the bar... right? SMFH,? we sit at the bar, waiting well over 6 mins before Angelica swiftly passes by to say \"I'll be w/you guys in a minute \" ummmm, who are you addressing!??? Then when she finally DOES come to us, she pisses me off by offering me a damn glass of Ghetto ass Moscato! There was a nice blonde couple sitting next to us, I didn't hear her offer HER any damn Moscato! I declined then asked her \"who in the Hell would drink a dessert wine with a Brooklyn style brick-oven pizza!?\" She apologized then said well a lot of people ask for it, me being a smart ass then replied, \" well maybe next time you wait for someone to ASK rather than offer that disgusting crap!\" I noticed it took unusually long for our pizzas to arrive, when they did... miss busy-body hadn't even set up the trays or anything and when I asked the guy that brought it out to do so, he gave more attitude than a queen on RuPaul's drag race!!!! the pizza was cold, and one of my $4 toppings were missing! Although it was cold, it was still good. I hate writing bad reviews, but the entire experience was horrible from the guys preparing the pizzas just an ear shot away from the bar having HIGHLY inappropriate conversations in addition to the fact that the service here was just dreadful!!!! Needless to say, I absolutely will NEVER be returning! Looks like I'll just be going home to LA when I need a GRIMALDI's fix!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are pretty patient people... but we were given a table on the patio around 9pm on Sunday.. We had to be sitting there for AT LEAST 15 minutes and no server in sight. No joke!! So we asked the table next to us if they had seen a server around, and they told us they were actually waiting for their check and had been waiting a while. Needless to say, we left before we were even greeted."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza around. Love how light the crust is and you can tell they only use fresh ingredients. Their salads and desserts are also delicious.  We've been coming here for years and the service has improved ten fold. Because it's such a popular restaurant, the wait can be very long but we always make a reservation or walk around and shop while we wait.   Overall, we will be life long customers. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Well thanks Grimaldi's you managed to screw up a quiet New Year's Eve dinner at home. We ordered take out at 5:45. They quoted 2 1/2 hours take our time. Ok no biggie. We showed up to pick it up at 8:15 and it was STONE COLD. Obviously had been sitting for quite a while. Also we ordered a kale salad with lemon dressing. Got home and found no dressing. So cold pizza and dry salad. Honestly you guys suck!!"}
{"text":"Great food wonderful staff always friendly. Fantastic service Rachel was the best fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Super delicious!!! The pizza and salads are so good. Great for kids too. They can be very busy on Friday and Saturday nights so if you don't have time to wait for a table to open up then definitely order out. It can be a little pricey for pizza but worth it if you are really looking for something good. I wouldn't even consider it New York style. It's just a really good brick oven pizza with that smokey taste to the crust yummm!"}
{"text":"You might note that my original review starts with a disclaimer about my lack of pizza experience. I've gained a little experience since then, but maybe this place has worsened a little too.  A year after my first visit, I returned to Grimaldi's for another birthday pizza. I ordered the same large pizza (red sauce) with meatballs. From the birthday coupon, I got $19 credit back for it again. I think prices have gone up though, with $16 for the base 18\" large pizza and $4 for the meatballs. I ended up having $1 worth of pizza to pay.  Let's cut to the chase. Despite being quite hungry (I'd arrived straight from work), I wasn't very impressed with what I tasted this time around. The pizza just seemed pretty bland. Maybe some of the acidic tomato notes stood out, but not the sliced meatballs, and definitely not the cheese. I tried all sorts of condiments on top, including parmesan, red pepper flakes, and pepper, but I just wasn't getting much help. The table didn't even have oregano (or garlic, as I now recall) as it did last year, but I don't know how much those would have helped even if they'd been available.  I should note that I ate some of the leftover pizza after taking it home and popping it in the oven, and that pizza stood out in terms of crispy crust and just having more of the flavors. Actually, it tasted hot, as opposed to the warm-ish pizza that our server was able to touch despite warning us of the temperature. I'm guessing that there was a delay at the restaurant from oven to table due to the hectic service during the already crowded dinner hours, and that lessened the experience.  I would have considered keeping my rating at four stars for the pizza, but I also tried a dessert trio ($10) with half-sized portions of the tiramisu, Oreo cheesecake, and seasonal pumpkin cheesecake. Perhaps the latter was the most flavorful of the bunch, but again, they all seemed a little too bland and fleeting in flavor. The number of superior versions of all of these desserts outweigh the misses, so I can only conclude that the desserts are below average. I'd rather have the tiramisu at Trattoria Nakamura-ya again, the pumpkin cheesecake from Lazy Dog, or pretty much any slice from Cheesecake Factory (a place that's not even top of the line, mind you).  I'll be back in a year, but I won't be too enthused. Furthermore, I'm not even going to consider returning until then. On top of having had good experiences at Flour & Barley (via a Yelp event) and Little Tony's, I know that I can customize a far more complex and delicious pizza at Blaze Pizza not too far down the street. I simply can't see the same luster in Grimaldi's as I did before."}
{"text":"Good tasting thin crust NY style pizza and very reasonably priced for Vegas.  When you just want good solid grub and you're hanging out at either the Palazzo or Venetian, this is the place to go.  Wish they sold pizza by the slice but since everything's made to order I understand that's not possible.  Not a big deal though, just order a personal and it's plenty enough for a single serving."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here. A small was big enough to feed 4 of us. We ordered a large mushroom pepperoni green pepper, and a small spinach arugula prosciutto and cheese with white sauce.  We started with a large Caesar salad. More than enough and we took nearly an entire pizza home! Courtyard is so pretty and the misters are a godsend in the summer heat. Next time we'll do smalls or personal size."}
{"text":"Great brick oven pizza. We look for places that use a long fermentation, and their pizza dough proofs for up to 2 days! The wine list was ample. The house salad was nice. Service was great! We'll be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I'm no pizza expert, but this place is a small slice of heaven!  Never been much of a pizza bloke as I felt being full by of average crusts and semi cold delivered pizza from the big boys of Pizza, Pizza Hut etc wasn't really healthy or satisfying.  Situated in Boca park next to Cheesecake Factory, Embers and Kona Grill. grimaldi's has a great layout with stool style seating, sit down dining area and a small patio area out the front to boot. The pizza is a Coal Brick oven style that unlike a lot of other places sets up for topping priority tasting dish.  Having been here a few times I've always found the Antipasti a great starter with a nice serving of bread with olive oil and vinegar.  Ordering a Sausage, Pepperoni, Ricotta cheese pizza, the medium size pizza was enough for 3 people easy. Presentation is always top notch and competes with most pizza joints locally.  The service here is prompt but also it can be sometimes a little wait to get a table as it's always fairly busy most day/nights of the week.   One of the only cons is even though they had high chairs for children, the menu didn't really have much flexibility for what the little ones can be served. I asked if they had a pasta dish that could be served in a smaller portion but the server pretty much nix anything that was asked.."}
{"text":"paper thin crust pizza! I recommend the white pizza and don't go overboard with the toppings, the garlic and cheese in the crust brings out a lot of flavor ,maybe just some onions mushroom and chicken (the way I like it) is the way to go!  woohooo!  * I start with the caprese salad, good enough for 2 people, luckily the bf doesn't like caprese so more for me!"}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. First time there with my mom and the server explained the whole menu. The pizza was delicious and you can customize it any way you want. We had the Don and customized it half pesto sauce and half white sauce. I enjoyed the pesto sauce more simply because the garlic in the white sauce was a bit too strong. Definitely recommending this place to my friends and will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This Grimaldi's is a good one. They are friendly, and usually don't have a long waiting time. I've been here snd can say I've tasted everything.  Different wine , gluten free, white sauce and red sauce. If I want pizza this is the place I go to. They don't have much variety but the chicken, beef meatballs will always get you thorough bad times. Trust me"}
{"text":"Good choice of ingredients, a bit out of a student budget, but it was WORTHY all the way. I was drooling with the flavors! Good environment and good service and good music (bistro style). I'm not much of a pizza eater, but this has a good place in my list! Forget about your papa dough or cheap Sunday pizzas...this is a real one!"}
{"text":"Great food, but I had a horrible experience with take out.  I submitted an online order on 3/3 for a pick up order on 3/4 at 540pm.  And it's 608pm and I am still waiting on my order.  In the mean time people calling in their orders today have gotten their pizza already."}
{"text":"I went to the Scottsdale location a while back and had one of the worst pizzas ever. I was reluctant to try Grimaldi's again but I'm glad I did. Maybe this location has better chefs?   The boyfriend and I went to satisfy our pizza cravings on a Saturday night. When we arrived we noticed there were several tables open on the patio. So when we walked in we asked the hostess to seat us out side. We were rudely told there no tables available. The other hostess even asked about a certain table and hostess number one told her it was reserved. Okay then. I understand if there aren't tables open but the condescending tone was not needed. So we sat inside.  The waitress was nice, luckily, and we ordered a caesar salad and a sausage and ricotta pizza. The salad was good, nothing exceptional but good. The pizza however was delicious. A million times better than in Scottsdale. The crust was nice and crispy, the sausage had good flavor and it had lots of big dollops of ricotta. I kept eating even when I was full because it was so tasty.   I would not hesitate to go back. Hopefully the hostess will be in a better mood next time."}
{"text":"Maybe I went on an off day but I was not impressed with this pizza.  But before I get into that, I was also not impressed with the service. Our waiter was just kinda weird. And not in a good way. Every time he came to our table he would stand there and wait for us to speak first which I found rather strange and off putting. He was the employee, shouldn't he have led the conversation? He literally stood by our table until I said \"well, I think we're ready to order.\" Weird. Whatever.  The boyfriend and I ordered a sausage and mushroom pizza. I was excited because I usually love hand-tossed brick oven pizza and I had read so many great reviews. Our pizza was lukewarm and the crust in the middle of the pizza was soggy. It was fine on the outer edges but what a way to start a slice - with a mouthful of soggy pizza goo. I thought it was pretty expensive as well.  So now all I think of when I think of Grimaldi's is a soggy pizza. Yuck. I don't think I'll be rushing back for more."}
{"text":"Best pizza in greater Phoenix area. Seriously.  Order a pepperoni pizza and melt away. Cheesecake wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Nice atmosphere even for kids. We had three kids with us and a baby. The host offered us some pizza dough for our young kids to play with after they got bored with their crayons! I appreciate that they accommodated to young children as it was dinner time and they were getting a bit on edge. It was happy hour when we went so $2 off all drinks. Nice wine and beer selection. The salads are big enough to accommodate to two people. Overall it was a nice place to enjoy with family. Would love to go back again."}
{"text":"Me and my wife for a dinner Sunday night  And the pizza was very very good !!! I liked it so much so I'll come with my family and friends next time"}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's!  This location in The Palazzo was pretty easy to find.  Service was excellent and of course the pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely one of our favorite eat out pizzeria.  Love the thin crust and finally figured out the best combo for us.   White pizza with garlic +pesto +chicken + bacon +sun dried tomatoes  Or regular pizza with pepperoni + meatballs (definite must) + Mushroom + basil."}
{"text":"Went in for some pizza after a long afternoon walking around the Vegas strip with the family.. Pizza was NY or Chicago good, thin crust!  Cooked just right!  Waiter was attentive.  Ordered large and small pie and large salad for table.  Everything was cooked just right.  Only downside was they only serve pizza, wanted pasta but not available.. If your looking for good pizza in Vegas this place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This pizza took me straight back to my childhood!!!    They serve traditional thin crust New York style pizza here, backed in a coal brick oven which gives it a nice smoky flavor.   Hands down, best pizza in Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"Waited over 30 minutes to be seated at a table that was empty the whole time we were waitinf. Pizza was okay, red sauce was watery, garlic sauce was great. Server was great. Cheesecake was AMAZING. Highly recommend. Bathrooms were not kept up on."}
{"text":"Crusto perfecto! Just like the one in Brooklyn. The Quattro Formaggi was excellent. Had a spinach salad. Ask for more gorgonzola for the salad -- they'll bring a lot!"}
{"text":"People go nuts over Grimaldi's, I'm not totally sold.  It's good but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for it.  It's NY style, brick oven pizza.  The pepperoni's are the little ones and they kind of skimp on toppings.  The salads are very good and a small is plenty of food for 2. The pizzas are massive, I would think 1 pizza could feed 4 pretty easily.  The prices aren't horrible either, I think a large 1 topping pizza is around $20, a small salad is $7. I've had the calzone as well and it was pretty rough.  I wouldn't stray from the pizza.  The service is always pretty good.  Grimaldi's doesn't have any major flaws, the reason it only gets 4 stars is due to the hype.  Many people go crazy for Grimaldi's,  most of my family included, I just don't get it. Anyway,   if you join their birthday club they give you a free pizza the week of your birthday, which is cool."}
{"text":"Today we wanted to grab some good pizza but it was all negative.   It took a super long time to get our order - then we got our pizza - it was burned.  The manager came out & had the nerve to question us after looking at the burned pizza.  Never returning!  Super bad experience."}
{"text":"Ok why do I need to go to Las Vegas ( actually Henderson) to get a good New York Pizza? Because there is NO Grimaldi's in Los Angeles! While Deep dish is my FAVORITE style, I do love me a good NYC pie and this is tops. The crust is just perfect, well done, not soggy, with a bit of char on the edges ( the way a good NY should be thanks to a coal oven) the sauce is very tasty, although I would have liked a tad more. You can get extra sauce for $2 which is kind of annoying, just put more sauce on please. My favorite little pepperonis that get all crispy at the edges.  We also ordered the antipasto salad and a house salad, that had an awesome mix of veg, and literally could have fed 8 ( there were 4 of us).  Alas, I have to go back to LA and not -so- great selection of New York style pies. 1 Star off for making me pay for xtra sauce otherwise outstanding!"}
{"text":"They accidentally ordered our pizza incorrectly, most likely related to husbands hard of hearing. We were apologized 3 times and given a free large pizza along with our free large pizza for my birthday.  I felt bad. They sure go out of their way and they do have really good pizza.  Service couldn't be any better."}
{"text":"Really great service!! Came here for my birthday (If you sign up for their emails they give you a free 16\" pizza on your birthday) and got a pizza with sun-dried tomatoes, strawberry Italian soda, Mediterranean salad, and cheesecake. The pizza was just a little burnt (for my taste) which is why I gave them a 4/5. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I tried Grimaldi's in NY and thought it was the best pizza ever!  So I was excited to hear that there are a few Grimaldi's locations in Vegas.  I do not have to fly across the country to get my Grimaldi fix.  This location in the mall is pretty cool.  If you sit at the bar, you will have a nice view of the fashion show when they raise the stage.    I think this Grimaldi's is similar but different from the NY locations.  It tasted similar, but it was missing the WOW factor.  I think when I had it in NY, they used better ingredients."}
{"text":"Very good coal-fired brick oven pizza.  But it taste better at the Grimaldi's in NY.  Maybe its the water."}
{"text":"The food was great, I loved both the pizza and salad we got. The server, however, (her name was Kathy) was not welcoming or friendly at all. She did not check up on us even though I saw she clearly checked on her other tables."}
{"text":"We liked the food here. When they brought our salad to the table with our pizza (we didn't mind) but they took it off our bill for the perceived inconvenience. We will give the NY location a visit."}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice crispy thin crust, great sauce best I have had since moving to the valley.  Service was also good will be back for more I highly recommend giving them a try."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza. Plain and simple, I have had none better. Grimaldi's in Old Town is almost exactly my envisionment of a perfect restaurant. To die for food, a romantic yet lively interior, a great jazzy soundtrack, dimmed but not too dark lighting, professional staff, varied drink list and wonderful outdoor seating. Geez, it's always such a treat to come here. Grab a bottle of wine and and a pesto pizza with ricotta and sausage and soak up the intoxicating atmosphere. Five big fat stars."}
{"text":"First time at Grimaldi's my wife had the calzone and she said it was fantastic. She loved it. I had a pizza. The first slice was awesome. After that my only complaint was the crust was very soggy. Other than that it was very good. Just the right amount of toppings. The staff was great, checking on you when needed but not bugging you. And the price was decent. Will go back."}
{"text":"On a fairly recent trip to New York, I opted to try out Lombardi's instead of Grimaldi's. And while I can't comment on whether the Las Vegas location is exactly the same as the one in New York, from what I can tell, I think Grimaldi's is much better than Lombardi's.  Now I'm a deep dish pizza kind of girl. Not that I hate thin crust, but I do not prefer it. Grimaldi's was still excellent in my eyes, and I would definitely come back given the option on a future Vegas trip. I really enjoyed the sausage as a topping, but I would stay away from the bacon, as it's a bit too salty.   Keep in mind when you come here that this is New York style pizza. It's thin crust, it's simple. I'm thinking that maybe some of the negative reviews here are grounded on unmatched expectations due to unfair or unrealistic standards.   Four girls split a large pizza and a large salad. Just the right amount of food.  Oh, keep in mind, if you want to do half-half on your pizza and have a certain topping on only half of your pizza, they will still charge you as if you had that topping on your ENTIRE pizza. In other words, if mushrooms cost \"X\" amount of dollars as a topping for your whole pizza, they will still charge you \"X\" amount of dollars to get mushrooms on only half your pizza. Kinda lame.  Inside decor was nice as well, with New York subway pictures and signs.  Located up on the second floor in the Grand Canal Shoppes! You might have to ask around for directions, since it wasn't on the maps yet when I was there."}
{"text":"Wow very disappointed nick was very rude and said about 3 words to us and asked me if I knew how a menu worked?!? NeVER COMING HERE AGAIN, the food was really good though we had the don and a piece of tiramisu"}
{"text":"A year and half after my original review, this place is still a consistent 5 star experience every time I go. I make sure to hit it up every time we're in Vegas, even if its just to grab a pizza for the road to eat later. I've also tried the Summerlin location once and it was just as good. I love this pizza every time I have it and I crave it when I'm in Cali and can't have it. I don't know what they do that makes it so good but I'm absolutely addicted!"}
{"text":"Try the caprese salad, so delicious! We also had the meat lovers pizza. The pizza was on a thin crust and you could taste all the ingredients which led to a light, refreshing lunch. They have 50% off wine glasses and bottles on Tuesdays. There house wine is delicious!   It's a nice clean restaurant and the staff is friendly. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"There must be something about the coal fired oven that gives the crust that amazing char and crispness that cannot be duplicated Unfortunately coal ovens are illegal in my hood, SoCal, so us Angelenos can never sample true East Coast style thin crust pizza. Fortunately, Vegas is only a short trip away, and Grimaldi's is the place to get your fix!   On our last trip to Vegas, I split a pie with my brother for lunch, sausage and mushroom. Toppings were good, but what I really dug was the cheese, slices of fresh mozzarella laid on top of the pie, comparable to Lombardi's in Manhattan. Sauce was good, and lastly, the crust had the authentic, coal fired char that makes the pie really stand out.   My favorite pizza in Sin City and I can honestly say that I've sampled nothing in California that quite matches up to Patsy's."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday lunch for a friend(only 4 or us in attendance) We all ordered the lunch special of a white pizza with side Cesar salad and an iced tea. My companions each received their lunches and then I was advised by our server he forgot to place my order and it would only be 3-5 minutes for my pizza. Normally the service is good, not today. When my pizza finally arrived, well after the rest of my party was finished eating, I asked for a to go box as our lunch hour is over. The waiter apologized and told me he was having it compt, I was appreciative of the gesture. Then my bill arrived and the only item compt was the pizza and I was charged separately for my tea and side salad. Now I did eat the salad and drink the tea but to be charged $7.08 for a side lunch salad and iced tea is ridiculous considering the lunch special for the pizza, side salad and drink for my companions was only $9.00. What a joke and I definitely will consider twice before eating at Gimaldi's Pizzeria again!"}
{"text":"Obviously THE GRIMALDI's pizza is phenomenal and this place doesn't disappoint. The authentic crust with a slightly sweet sauce is great. Full bar is offered."}
{"text":"I finally tried Grimaldi's Pizzeria and I am so glad that I did!  I have been hearing about this place for ages and have been wanting to try it for just as long.  And it was so yummy!  We popped in for lunch and were seated right away.  Our server came by and gave us the scoop on the different types of pizza and the ordering process.  We decided on what we wanted, which was our go to of pepperoni and mushrooms on the regular pizza.  We then sat and waited for our pizza to come out while smelling all of the pizzas around us.  We were salivating like rabid dogs just from the wonderful aromas drifting this way and that!  Nothing really smells better than fresh baked pizza in my book! Yummmm.  So when our beautiful pepperoni and mushroom pizza arrived, we attacked the pie like no one's business.  The first bite I took resulting in me seeing fireworks going off.  I totally had a party in my mouth.  All I can say about the flavor is AMAZING!  I was in love from the first bite.  By the time I had finished my lovely first slice, my hubby was on his 3rd piece.  I don't think he was taking time between bites to breathe or even chew.  He was in pizza ecstasy!  We are now Grimaldi's lovers!  It has been added to our list of regular pieces to visit.  They have an email club and if you plan on going, I would sign up for it.  They send decent coupons pretty regularly and even a free pizza for your birthday!  I had actually signed up for the email club before we went.  I love a good coupon!   If you haven't checked this place out, I highly recommend it.  I think you will be please!"}
{"text":"Food is always great.  The wood firing process can be rather inconvenient at times so make sure you know when that process occurs or expect to wait over an hour for food."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza I have ever had!  I absolutely HATE cold pizza (leftover pizza) and I ate two slices for breakfast after having 3 slices the night before! As far as staff, they are nothing to brag about, but the AMAZING quality of pizza overcomes the meh staff. I don't mind paying more for Grimaldis pizza because it is the only NY style pizza out there that is actually worth it.  My favorite toppings are their cute mini sized pepperoni and the artichoke hearts. Yum !"}
{"text":"Wow, without a doubt one of the best place for pizza in the world paired with great wine and also awesome service. With the brick oven that carrys the pizza through the cooking process and gives it that elegant flavor, you can not beat grimaldis pizzeria. My wife and I go to this pizzeria almost every friday to catch up with friends and have that great feeling of being home and also feeling like you are wanted. We plan to keep going to this place for years to come based off food and service."}
{"text":"went here for lunch with family. our server Jalani was great, frequently checked up on us, and I think it was the manager, she checked up on us as well....ordered a large pepperoni/sausage pizza, caprese salad, and a calzone...all were great tasting and I'll will be eating at this location more often.."}
{"text":"Great pizza, albeit a little overpriced.  They are a little stingy where they charge full price even if you get the toppings on half of the pizza.  Whatever, they make a damn good pizza. With that perfectly crisped thin crust and good portion of toppings.  The service is a little slow, and the pizza does a take a bit, but it is all worth it.  Also a good place to cougar watch, for some reason they love this place!"}
{"text":"Used to go to Grimaldi's in NY and Hoboken NJ, both are awesome. Went to this location and they definitely do not disappoint!"}
{"text":"It has been a few years since I last tried Grimaldi's. And this is a different location than the first one I tried. This one I noticed to be much snaller. But I knew the pizza to be great thun crust style and thought it would be good for my family to try.  There were 7 of us last night. We got to the restaurant at what seemed like a late hour to me. Apparently 7:00 PM isn't really that late and the restaurant was packed. It only aboutb5 minutes before we got a seat though. They were quick on that. Unfortunately we were put into a small side room crammed around two small tables. Lucky for us we are a close family and didn't mind the close quarters. Ut got a little stuffy in there onve we all had a few drinks in us and hot pizzas in front of us.  Speaking of pizza and drinks, the food was the easy part. A Grimaldi house salad, a Mediterranean salad, a large The Don Pizza (pepperoni, sausage and meatballs) and a large with sausage and mushrooms. The drinks were a little more challenging. What beers do we want? Which wine do we want? Too many options you know.  The salads were fine. A nice variety of ingredients and a nice vinaigrette. We could have used a bit more of the dressing and my aunt actually did order some more on the side. Salad is just filler any how. It was the pizza we were there for.   Half of us ate the one with mushrooms and sausage and we all shared the Don. Both were really good but I think we all preferred the Don. The meatballs on it were great. A good size with a fresh flavor. Both pizzas were a little soggy in the middle. Being such a thin crust it cannot hold up to the sauce too well. The edges, however, were superb. Crispy and slighlty charred. Most all of us ate the crust and there were a few in the group who don't normally do so. What does that tell you?  In the end, everyone was pleased with the choice which made me happy because this family has a tendency to be hypercritical of restaurants. We all enjoyed ourselves, pigged out on some quality pie and teased the waiter a bit. He was cool with it. He was even laughing when trying to take the order of the group next to us. His quality customer service was noteable as was the service of the lady who brought our food. She cleared the table for the salad bowls and served up a couple slices of pizza to get us started. Good job all around."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's came highly recommended to me by a friend I was dog sitting for. For the most part, I liked it. The dark furniture, the checker table cloths, the wine bottle chandeliers all provide for a nice, intimate atmoshpere. It would be a little classier with fewer windows and candle lit tables. I appreciate the black and white photos of NYC but the subway signs area bit campy. As for the food, I ordered a simple personal size pizza with meatballs and onions. It was delicious. Not as much cheese as would be on a pizza from other places I would order from. And the crust is much thinner than I typically like. It was good though. A perfect balance of crunch and chew. I had planned on bringing home half my pizza for later but the thinness of the crust did not fill me enough. That coupled with the deliciousness of it prevented me from saving any at all. I finished my pizza right there in the restaurant. I had to wait a long time as when I walked in they were just cleaning the ovens in preparation for the dinner rush. It was almost a boring wait. It would have seemed a long time were it not for the 1940's lounge tunes playing not so softly over head. I was singing right along to much of the music. That passed the time quite nicely."}
{"text":"Wife and I had the large Don with ricotta added. One of the best pizzas we've ever had. This is the first time at the Scottsdale restaurant. We had the same pizza in Las Vegas and it was delicious but Scottsdale nailed it."}
{"text":"While we were waiting for our table, I decided to go get a glass of wine by the bar. There was no bartender at the bar, but someone kept walking back there. 3 times they overlooked me waiting there until they finally asked if I needed something. I wasn't too happy about that since we were already made to wait for a table and there were TONS of open tables. They weren't that busy, so I was a little confused by all of this.   The food was fantastic as usual. I've been to almost every AZ Grimaldi's location at this point (even the original in Brooklyn!) and the pepperoni & jalapeño is just amazing. It's the only pizza I actually crave.   Luckily, our waiter had impeccable customer service skills, so it slightly made up for the initial bad service I received. Still..I had to take off a star for it."}
{"text":"100% my favorite place to get pizza in the Valley. I've been to the original in Brooklyn and it has nothing on the ones out here! Pepperoni and jalapeño is the way to go. Haven't ordered anything different in all the years I've eaten here. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had not been to a Grimaldi's in about five years prior to this visit. I knew that it was a rather pricey pizza restaurant but I was craving pizza and we were at San Tan Mall so I figured I would give it another try. I was with my sister and she did have her dog with her so we asked one of the manager's if we could sit outside on the patio with the dog. At first she said no but then she told us if we could find a seat near the edge of the railing and tie him up on the outside of the rail, we could eat on the patio. We did end up finding a perfect spot where we were able to tie him up and have him right next to us while sitting on the patio. It was really nice of her to let us do that and accommodate our needs with the dog. Good start.  We were pretty hungry last night and we both really wanted a starter of some kind, garlic bread, bruschetta, something like that... To our surprise Grimaldi's carries no form of appetizers other than salads. Salads are great and all but we just couldn't believe that they had no other kind of appetizer. When we asked our waitress if they had any sort of bread she  seemed almost irritated that we even asked. We decided that we would just end up ordering a starter caesar salad because really this was one of our only choices. We also ordered a large   pepperoni, onion and jalapeno pizza. The salad was okay. The caesar dressing was a little to bitter for me, a little too much vinegar for my tastes.  The pizza here for me is just okay. Some people really love Grimaldi's and to each their own, but it is just not the pizza of choice for me. The crust was a little over done which because of the coal brick oven gave it a slight burned taste. I did like the fresh mozzarella and that was probably the best part of the pizza but I found myself eating around other parts of the pizza just to get to the bits of cheese. I am just not a fan of Grimaldi's pizza and I won't find myself coming back here to pay $22 for a pizza I don't like. The service was pretty good. Our waitress was very attentive. I did get a slight sense of arrogance from her but overall she kept our drinks refilled and she did answer our questions even if she was a little snooty about it. I did give a three star because even though this is not the pizza for me, it is not bad pizza, just not my taste."}
{"text":"Awesome pie! The service was stellar, the ingredients were fresh and non-processed as well.  The manager Robert engaged in conversation with us and we are now loyal customers.  While a chain restaurant, they do things right."}
{"text":"Great pizza!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to Grimaldi's, which is directly across the street from our usual pizza place, BJ's. The decor is contemporary NY pizza parlor with a friendly host to hold the door open for you. I loved the half inside/half outside bar concept, but sadly with it being over 100 degrees at 8pm, I didnt think I could pass up the AC inside.   The staff were all friendly and you could even spot the managers on the floor (no they dont do table touches haha). The menu was so small its amazing, but if you want a good thin crust pizza, it serves it purpose. I was incredibly impressed with the flavor and size of it and would def. recommend it to all you thin crust lovers out there."}
{"text":"Great pizza, terrible takeout pickup process.  Picking up a pizza requires you to stand in the most awkward, high traffic area (end of the bar) in the restaurant.  My recent trip had 3 others in front of me trying to dodge staff and patrons just to pick up our orders.  Note to the Manager, make it a low customer effort process and have your Hosts take care of it for your patrons at the Host stand.  We're just as important as those who choose to dine in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Another wonderful meal.  Our waiter, Ulyssus, was appropriately attentive.  We were neither overwhelmed nor ignored. He is so concerned about our satisfaction and funny. As always the managers, Jeff and Derek were very aware of everything going on so our visit was easy peasy and DELICIOUS! The pizza is prepared wonderfully, the Ceaser salad great, the bruschetta delish.  Restaurant is always clean and staff friendly. Great patio with views.  Suggest you try it."}
{"text":"This place has never let me down.  Dine in or Pick up, you get great New York style thin crust.  Word from the wise, don't overload your pizza with toppings b/c it will start to detract from the pizza itself.  I suggest 3 items max.  I love the sweet red pepper, onion and garlic combo."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's pizza, but this review is based on the service of this particular restaurant.  We ordered a large pepperoni on Saturday night and was told it would be ready in 20 minutes and to meet them at the pickup location on the side of the building.  We arrived after 15 minutes and parked at the designated pick up location.  We sat there, and sat there, no one came out to greet us. We sat there for 15 minutes and finally someone came out to take our money.  This was not a big deal HOWEVER, the pizza was cold!    I don't understand how they could mess up this bad because they could clearly see our car in the pick up location and they were not busy inside.  The only explanation is that they are just not good at their jobs.  The owner of this place needs to restaff soon.  The Grimaldi's on Eastern has a staff that is crazy good.  This location's staff only tarnishes the Grimaldi's name."}
{"text":"Best pizza i think in vegas. Download the app postmates if you are a sloth and want this amazingness delivered to you. A little pricey but damnnnnn. This is some good pizza"}
{"text":"There is no better pizza on earth than Grimaldi's. I just wish there was one in Orange County California. Oh well, a good reason to revisit Vegas often."}
{"text":"Have only been here for lunch as I work around the corner and don't live too close. The pizza has been excellent every time as well as the service. If you like think crust not greasy pizza - give them a try."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY, the best pizza in southern Nevada! The pizza is always fresh, made fresh as ordered. The wait staff is very friendly and effecient!I never hesitate to take out of town visitors here for a great pie and a great evening!"}
{"text":"I've been to Grimaldi's many times at other locations around town so my review is on all the locations plus my recent visit to the fashion mall location. I had a large greek salad and a pepperoni pizza and it was simply amazing.   I love that they offer thin crust and that their prices are affordable and menu is simple. The service is always great and whatever location you choose is usually packed, which is great for business and it shows that Grimaldi's knows what they're doing.  I'd say out of all the pizza joints in town this would be my second favorite and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I give them a 3 being the food was the only thing that was good about our dinner here. Out server had no personality at all was dry and rude. Not to mention she wasn't attentive. We placed our order for drinks and food with our dry server and after that another server came and offered to take our order and I wish she would have been our server much more personality and very kind. Well we got our food rather quick brought by yet another server. At this point we still have not seen our actual server again. She quickly stopped by the table and said \"oh you got your food that was quick\" she then quickly walked off. Not noticing we both needed refills on our drinks my boyfriend went to the bar to get our drinks refilled. I would come back being the food is amazing. Atmosphere is ok but could use a little work on service. Maybe just by our server being the tables around us are were all getting well taken care of. Maybe an off night for her next time may be better. But I do reccomend the food. Maybe just do Togo.."}
{"text":"Mmmm... excellent! Thin crust and good-quality, fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. Actually, this was some of the best pizza I've had anywhere.. and I'm a New Yorker who's tried lots of pizza. The service was really good too. Can't remember our waiters name but he had a 'famous stars and stripes' tattoo on his forearm. Nice guy."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for a romantic date or a family outing. I took my in-laws here when they were in town from New Mexico, and they loved the pizza and the service. Cocktails are excellent.   Also, they have the second best cannoli that I've ever had. (The best one was from an Italian bakery in New York, so that is hard to beat.)"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 10 at 4pm. When we arrive they told us they had to shut off the ovens at 4 and our pizza would be done until 4:45pm..which is fine.. Then they said we would be kicked out at 5pm for another reservation. So we only had 15minutes to eat. Great costumer service.. Said no one ever."}
{"text":"Folks, I am Grimaldis most frequent customer. I don't go a week without it. My record is eating it four days straight. So I guess that says, I love this place? My only complaint is my AT&T service is occasionally poor. :P I even worked here for a day!  So, what about Grimaldis? Well, the pizza is amazing. The salads are amazing. The cheesecake is amazing. And if you like Calzones, I'm sure those are amazing as well. They also have wine if you are of age unlike me ;)  Here is one thing not to fall for if you are ordering for the first time and it is to go. Don't order a small if you want a small. Their small is actually a medium. You want a PERSONAL.   I get my pizza with salami and pepperoni, always. Those meats are a deadly combination for me. I like to add parmesan to the top, even though the cheese is delicious as is. Sometimes I even venture out a little more and add vinegar, which I think tastes delicious! Everything is great on the pizza. Only pizzeria bianco has topped it (but that one is 45 minutes farther away and requires a 2.5 hour wait at the least).   Keep in mind, Grimaldi's stokes their ovens from 4-5. No pizza for you then. Make sure to be careful late on Saturdays and Fridays, as they can get busy!  One more thing, the management of the place is great. They've taken the time to get to know me. The general manager of all the stores, Ken, has even sat down with me to discuss Macs before. Very personal company that has truly gotten to know their clientele.   KEEP IT UP GRIMALDIS!"}
{"text":"The crust is crisp, but soft in the middle with the perfect char from the coal oven. Great sauce. With a lot of  choices of toppings with a good wine selection. Service has always been good, but eating In the bar is a plus because the day bartender. Toni is great!! No doubt,  the best chain pizza restaurant! My personal favorite is sausage, mushroom, and onion with a nice sangiovese."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza! Thin crispy crust, lightly used but delicious sauce, chunks of cheese instead of shredded...even just the plain cheese is perfection! Also love mixing pesto and tomato sauces on a pizza. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This pizza was great.  Pizza sauce makes a good pizza and this was outstanding.  Great service.  Loved the \"chandelier\".  Great experience."}
{"text":"I'm sold...  I'm smitten...  I'm all in...  I'm coming back for more...  I'm blown away...  I'm debating a return for dinner tomorrow night.    Ambiance = B+ Atmosphere = A Bar/Beverages = A- Food = A+ Overall = A  Possibly the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have NO idea why this restaurant has been rated so highly. This weekend, before me and my friends senior winter formal, we decided to have dinner here before. LIttle did I know i was about to encounter the WORST customer service I've ever received in my entire life. We were a party of 16 and you would already expect a party of 16 to be a little loud. They had already placed us outside when we had requested inside but we understood due to the size of the party. As we are sitting there and everyone is arriving a party of two has already complained about our noise level. Not only was this party done eating but they had decided to stare us down. We had waved at her and she then decided to come over to our table and instigate a confrontation. Calling us children and that our money was irrelevant because it had come from our parents. The funny thing is that we all have jobs, college scholarships, and are legally adults. I have never seen an adult act so childish in my entire life. I was appalled. The manager had then asked us to leave because this women had decided to cause a scene. The irony of this actually makes me laugh. Anyways we also were told we had to pay for our meals as well. So as mature people would do, we complied. We then preceded to Sauce where the customer service was 100x better. Go figure. I will be speaking to someone higher up in this establishment and i will not be back until this manager has been fired. No guest should be treated this way. If you want italian food in Old Town, I highly recommend Buca Di Beppo. The customer service and food is better anyway. This establishment does not deserve any business until they learn how to treat guests properly."}
{"text":"They have great pizza...although sometimes they do burn the crust. Which ruins the flavor of the pizza. I love how you can get added mozzarella and their salads are tasty. If you do curb side pick up be prepared for them not to pay attention ti the fact you're outside waiting. Its faster to just go in and get it yourself. Not sure why they have curb side pickup if they dont pay attention to whos outside waiting. Overall its good here the salads are the main reason why I continue to eat here due to the fact there are places around that do have better pizza for better prices and other places have delivery this place doesnt."}
{"text":"What an unexpected surprise! We ordered a couple pizzas and a salad for dinner. The pizzas were cooked in a coal fired oven and were cooked perfectly. The crust was a nice level of light and crunchy. The sauce had a great tomato flavor and the real cheese blend was fresh and full of flavor, but it didn't have the heavy grease that you get from a lot of cheese blends. A few slices in and I was pleasantly full. I came back after the pizza to try the accompanying salad. The lettuce was crisp and fresh.  As far as New York style pizzas go, this was great. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! The service wasn't the best but hey, the pizza isn't as expensive so that balances it out. I like that they have beer options and wine. Salad was good and to my surprise they don't serve ranch? Maybe it's a bit to classy for ranch but other than that. Everything was good. Clean as well."}
{"text":"Great experience!  Our server, Shelly was awesome and really made sure we enjoyed our visit.  Great manager too!  She made sure everyone was taken of. The best pizza I've had since we moved here- great quality and nice atmosphere.  We will definitely return!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"The pizza here was far superior to the one at Enoteca Otto. We added our own toppings: pesto base, Italian sausage, mushrooms, olives, fresh tomatoes, & sweet peppers on thin yummy crust. It took time to prepare but was very much worth it, so delicious! We got thge large 18 inch for 4 of us which was more than plenty. We also had the Mediterranean Salad came in a largish bowl, it was so fresh, crispy and a very good size that you can easily split. For dessert we had the Baileys Irish cream cheesecake and Tiramisu, both were excellent. They made the cheesecake in house (!) and the Tiramisu they order. My mom hates cheesecake, but the Irish cream flavor made her love it. Honestly, one of the best freshest cheesecakes I've ever had. Service was also excellent. I would absolutely go again if this was in PDX. The atmosphere at the Palazzo was lovely, made to feel like you are in Italy. It was funny when the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit inside or out and my dad asked my mom for his jacket hahah. I mean, you are inside regardless but with that beautiful blue painted sky, it's easy to forget!"}
{"text":"Apparently my friends loved this place enough to want to go here AGAIN. We tried the pesto this time with the same toppings. It was less salty thus, I liked it a lot better!   We decided to order a half pesto/half white with garlic sauce to eat after the club. I wonder how well this pizza would taste 8 hours after ordering it because I remember the pizza being soggy when I ate it cold in NY. However this pizza held up. Definitely tasted better hot, but it actually held up pretty well eating it cold.  We also tried the Bailey cheesecake. It's an amazing dessert. Strongly recommend it if you have extra stomach space. It's still mostly cheesecake with a chocolate crust. It's lightly flavored with Bailey, awesome dessert."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Scottsdale, my husband and I were in the mood for anything but Mexican food as we had our fair share of Mexican cuisine our first few days in town. Hmmm... What should we have? What will hit the spot? Pizza, of course! Grimaldi's it is!  Grimaldi's is a casual pizzeria with a heavy Italian feel to it. Picture dark brick indoor walls, wine bottle chandeliers, red and white checkered tablecloths, and the amazing aroma coming from the coal-fired brick ovens. It was fairly crowded on the Saturday evening we dined here. Our server, though busy with several tables, kept our drinks full and a smile on her face the entire time.  Their menu consists of salads, pizzas, and calzones. My husband and I split a small caesar salad to start, and the small was still more than the two of us could finish. It was honestly one of the best caesars I'd ever had though. There is a bit of unexpected tanginess in the dressing that I simply loved. We then moved on to the main reason we were there... THE PIZZA!  They have an interesting way of ordering the pizzas. First you pick your size: 12, 16, or 18 inch. Then you pick your sauce: traditional tomato, pesto, or butter garlic. Finally, you pick your toppings. Each topping ranges in price from $2 - $4 and the price remains the same whether a topping is used for the entire pizza or only half. So if you're a deluxe pizza kind of person... you'll be paying for it. However, all ingredients are very fresh. They even make their mozzarella in-house and use their own secret recipe for the dough and sauces.   My husband and I went with a 16 inch, traditional sauce, half bacon (his) and half ricotta and black olive (hers). The crust was thin and crisp, the perfect amount of sauce was used, and the unique blend of melted ricotta blended with fresh slices of mozzarella and black olives was to die for. We both enjoyed our $8 worth of toppings very much!   Since Grimaldi's has many locations scattered throughout the U.S., I would definitely stop in again if I were near one. My only complaint is the a la carte pricing for each and every topping. The price can quickly escalate on your pizza if you're not careful, so choose wisely."}
{"text":"White pizza with extra garlic, pepperoni & mushroom Mmmmmmm. Not as scenic as the Brooklyn bridge location (you do get a cute fountain in front and there's outdoor patio seating), but it's soooo close to home! I don't have to fly to NYC to have Grimaldi's. And there's NO 1-hour wait outside (although I think the long wait and the crowded & tight dining area in NYC made the experience more authentic). My advice: eat there, don't take it to-go. The pizza tastes so much better fresh from the oven. I didn't try it at this location but the house red wine in NYC was deelish! don't forget XTRA GARLIC!"}
{"text":"Great service, nice hostess, nice level of music, but annoying fly.....gross. Fun that you can see the chef make the pizza and flip the dough. Great crust but I feel the sausage has too much cumin and the sauce is too sweet......just a personal preference. The Caesar salad had way too much dressing, the lettuce seemed a little wilted but the croutons were good."}
{"text":"I loveGrimaldis always get the  Large Peperoni and Mushroom have told many friends about it."}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first because I love the original.  However, it was delicious, and the service is great and prices reasonable.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Our family came after 10pm on a Sunday night.  The Margherita Pizza was delicious. It was the first thin pizza we had that was both crispy and chewy at the same time.  The Bruschetta Trio was good. The artichoke and tomato + basil were the best by far.  Strawberry lemonade was the BEST!"}
{"text":"A excellent pizza we found at Palazzo. We were starvin, and the pizza didn't disappointed us. We ordered the big one, which I think it's enough to two or three people. It was tasty and well prepared.  I just would do the border a little bit different. It was too crunch for me.   The service was fast, polite and formidable.   The restaurante was very clean, but don't expect anything luxurious in there, as any pizzaria should be."}
{"text":"Besides Dough Pizzeria in San Antonio, this is the best pizza I've had. Caesar salad was also really good - not drenched in dressing."}
{"text":"Staff was not very aware of their surroundings. Took them a while to get my order and take my card for the check.  Lets not lose sight of what is most important here.  The pizza is great. Cheese and sauce were very flavorful.  Pizza was perfectly cooked.  Imagine the first time you ate a slice of pizza. It is a very similar experience.  An explosion of the perfect flavorings, my mouth exploded.  4.4/5 stars. My brother says try extra sauce"}
{"text":"House red, large white pizza with garlic and impeccable service. Always consistent, Grimaldis is always a safe bet on cheat day!"}
{"text":"I LOVE that they offer a gluten free crust; unfortunately it suffers from the same challenges you find when you make one at home. They need to partially pre-bake the crust before they add the toppings to ensure that the crust gets really crispy. What we were served was a crust that was raw on top in the middle, with crispy edges and cheese that hadn't fully melted. Ambiance was nice and servers were pretty good, but I wouldn't make it a point to visit on my next spring training trip."}
{"text":"The best pizza that anyone can have in Vegas. The service was great too. This is located inside the Palazzo. They messed up our order and put toppings we did not ask for, but kindly made us another pizza free of charge and we kept both. It is a little pricey, but good to go with a group of friends and splitting the bill. Bring a jacket, it is alway so cold in there!"}
{"text":"Loved the white pizza. Great service. They let me sample the white Sangria before I made a choice of drink. They gave the kids pizza dough to play with."}
{"text":"Craving good pizza is a constant issue we have and Grimaldi's never fails to satisfy that void. We eschew the fancy toppings and always opt for the simply delicious Margherita Pizza. It is light, has a crunchy thin crust and just the right balance of sauce (Marzano Tomatoes), mozzarella cheese and basil. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Went there today and ordered a salad, a couple beers and 2 glasses of wine and a small dessert. Then built a 1/2 & 1/2 pizza with toppings. That's when the bill skyrocketed. The toppings doubled the price of the 16\" pizza. And like others said, hardly any toppings for the price. And you pay the same for toppings on 1/2 or whole pizza. Anyway $71+ later we were done. Pizza ok but not worth the price. Maybe go back if we get the free birthday pizza."}
{"text":"Very disappointed about how we were treated when we ate here the other night. We called ahead to let them know we had a party of 13 coming and they informed us that they don't take reservations, but if we get there before 5:30pm we should be fine. Okay. We head down and arrive at 5:30. As one of our party enters one of the hosts says, \"Oh you must be the party of 13.\" Yup, we have 13 and called ahead, but were told you don't hold tables. ANOTHER party of 13 enters right after us. They claim that they called ahead and were told a table would be prepared for them. The host staff then proceeded to seat the other party ahead of us! Really!?! We stood in front of the cold, crowded entrance for over a half hour waiting for our table.   I really don't feel this way often, but we were all disgusted with how we were treated. I talked to the manager afterward who seemed to me to be pretty disingenuous. Like, \"Yea, yea, that's terrible, we're so sorry. Wow, we feel so bad, is that all? Oh we'll discount your bill.\" She ended up taking $10 bucks off, which wasn't what we were looking for; but ended up being a slap in the face.   This review is intended to reflect this particular location. We love the food at Grimaldi's but will most likely drive across town to a different location in the future.   Easily the worst dining experience we've experienced this year."}
{"text":"Hands down this is one of the only places you can get the best quality pizza in Las Vegas. The pizza is literally to die for. It's kinda pricey but most definitely worth it. I highly suggest trying it. I've been going here for years. They're service is amazing and this restaurant has a very nice style to it making you enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"There's a location closer to my house, but I came here because I wanted to go to Fashion Square nearby. I got lucky and found parking right at the entrance during weekend lunchtime and I was seated next to the kitchen which was nice and cozy. My server, Caroline, was friendly and attentive as I ordered a 16\" traditional pizza with kalamata olives (note: these may and do contain pits). My pizza didn't take too long to arrive and the size of the slices were generous. I liked the thin crust and the bountiful toppings, they did not skimp on those olives.   I only ate 1.5 slices and packed the rest to go, since I had other places to be. It did take a while for my check to be taken and processed, but it was fine because I had a discount and I was able to leave a cash tip (a reason to always carry small bills!) I enjoyed the food and I would come back to try some more menu items."}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday Evening.  Wasn't too busy and was seated right away.  Female server was prompt and attentive but not overbearing or pushy like some places.  She took our order of a large sausage pizza.  Took about 15-20 minutes for the pizza to arrive.  Pizza was very good.  Some people are sadists and want their food piping hot when it's delivered so they can shovel it in right away and scald their mouths.  I, on the other hand, prefer my food to warm and hot but comfortably edible when it arrives.  Our pizza was brought to the table this way so that it was imediately edible, which was nice.  I do not like to have to sit and wait for 10 minutes for my food to cool down before eating.  As we finished our meal, I noticed the restaurant begin to fill up.  It was a nice family atmosphere.  Received our check in a timely manner and was processed in a timely manner as well.  We received drink refills as needed and did not have to wait very long for refills.  Overall, a good experience and great food.  Prices are reasonable; however, can get pricey depending on how many toppings you desire.  Parking could be an issue if it is busy.  The restaurant shares a parking are with a Hooter's restaurant that is about 4 spaces over.  The parking area is somewhat small for size of the business center as well as the types of businesses in the complex."}
{"text":"Upscale pizza place. Always delish and great atmosphere! The fresh basil on the pizza is one of my faves about the place.   We go regularly!"}
{"text":"I stopped here around 1:30 pm in a weekday  thinking pizza would be a quick 30 min lunch.  It took over an hour!  I had to go to the bar to get a refill on my drink because my waitress ignored my attempts to get her attention and never checked on me.  The food was nothing special and combined with the poor service causes me to give a poor rating.  I won't be back and can't recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Grimaldis is delish. I've never been disappointed or had a bad experience here. We come here a decent amount. It's great for a date night or to come with friends and it's a really great place to bring people when they come into town. It's a really classic feeling pizza place inside. The staff is always friendly and it is usually really crowded. They have private rooms for birthday parties, a patio, and two rooms of tables so it's pretty big. The Caesar salad is good to start with and then we usually go with our friends who know how to order the best pizza (extra sauce, ricotta and pepperoni  I think??). The ricotta is what really makes it tasty. They have a good wine selection and the house red wine is good. This is a good place for people of all ages too, we had some friends come into town with their baby and we were like where are we going to go in old town that's baby friendly? This worked out perfectly!"}
{"text":"Great pizza 95% of the time. Don't rush pizza! I've had a handful of overdone and 1 undercooked experience. But it's a nice place with great servers. Some of the bar staff and hostess station need to work on customer service but non the less a great family place. Nice location too btw!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick meal and open a lot later on weekdays than we thought so yay for that! Excellent service. Pepperoni is thick sliced and delicious. We also got a salad, small is perfect for 2 or even 3 people to share, but get the large if you want to have leftovers for lunch the next day! Sign up for the birthday thing, they reward your loyalty with a free large pie which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Had the Caprese Pizza. The freshness of the the ingredients was great. You can fold this pizza, New York style (said in my best New York Accent) Was a busy night so service was a little slow but was totally due to how busy it was. First time ,it was all in all good. Will be back to try much more."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm rating the Las Vegas location higher than the original Brooklyn one, but then again I'm all about good customer service. The pizza here was very nearly as delicious as it was in New York, the waiter who served it was quick and genial, and the restaurant itself was clean (though a bit kitschy in all its obvious New York decor). I would definitely come back during another Vegas trip."}
{"text":"What a difference- this Grimaldi is just across the street from the one  at the Palazzo/Venetian right in the Fashion Show Mall. As negative as my last review was for the one at the Palazzo - this one at the Fashion Show Mall is worth the extra way to walk over. Extremely friendly not pushy at all - just the way it should be. My server was Fernando- really nice - normal and just friendly. Food was outstanding.. very good - thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We went there on April 11th for an early dinner 5:30pm - the pizza is really good thin crust very tasty. However, our waitress Melanie was really pushy and actually annoying - she pushed us to order like crazy- trying to sell more even there was absolutely no need - I started laughing when she asked one in our group if he wants another beer - he had just done one sip out of his glass!?  She really made us feel very uncomfortable - there are other good pizza places around here.. I can spend $200 somewhere else - maybe they let us enjoy our orders a bit more. People are making a difference..!"}
{"text":"Excellent costumer service was told wait was going to be 25-30min wait, it was only about a 15min wait!..They honored my birthday coupon no hassle about it! And if course they pizza was on point!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE grimaldis pizza.. I've been going for years! ..but now I'm concerned about the cleaning procedures there. I witnessed an employee cleaning the pizza board on the trash. In plain view of the customers.. It was sickening. Cross contamination can make you very sick.. I did not want to review this but I feel like management or corp should be aware of this. My friend did call out the manager and address the issue. She apologized. But she was walking around the restaurant while this happened! Does she not see this? I  probably will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Easter sunday with the Family, the surroundings and ambiance was so casual. They also have classical music and jazzy tunes really do love the music choice. Our family ordered the Chefs choice half of the Brooklyn and the other half Don. The sausage here is what Im really a big fan off along with the sauce and very hearty roasted red peppers which make a great addition for your hungry taste buds. If you are ever in the Boca Park I suggest you stop by for a large pizza. Its a great time for the family and the Red Sangria is mouthwatering. Until next time!"}
{"text":"My first time at Grimaldi's was two weekends ago I believe. I was the third wheel to the couple that invited me along, but it worked out perfectly portion wise. They started off with the Caesar Salad (small) which looked pretty large to me.  I'm not a big fan of ordering salads since they don't do anything for me....just some greens tossed with sauce. They decided on ordering the Pesto Pizza with Onions, Sun Dried Tomatoes and Mushrooms. I'm not a big fan of onions, so I was picking them out. The pizza itself was a bit dry, but I think it was the Pesto. I didn't think there was anything spectacular or magical about the pizza, but I willing to go back and try the WHITE pizza which I think is more my style. Service was a bit slow, but overall its an ok pizza joint."}
{"text":"Born and raised in AZ, I've been to a lot of pizza places. I love trying out new pizza places and I'm thankful to live in Scottsdale, where my favorite pizza place lives. Grimaldi's is unlike any pizza I've ever had from anywhere in the valley. And yes, I've been to New York City and had their pizza. I'd pick Grimaldi's pizza over NYC pizza anyday. We've always had fantastic waiter's each time we go and I don't think we've ever had to wait. Parking in Old Town can be really bad at times, but we've never had to park far away either. It's always been a perfect experience. In comparison to say, Olive Garden, it's cheaper! I would recommend Grimaldi's to anyone in AZ, or visiting AZ. There are more locations in the valley and I haven't tried the others, but I'm guessing it's just as good. I haven't been hungry enough after chowing down on pizza to try any of the desserts, but one of these days I'm going to try their cannoli's.  This is spoken from someone who is 100% Italian. I'm choosing Patsy Grimaldi's for my Valentine's Day dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Exvellent service, ambience.  Classic gingham tablecloths - no frills pizza.  Makes a lot of Palazzo joynts look $teep and pretentious.  No kids menu but any easy to understand menu, simple pricing and very capable servers!! Open kitchen always a plus and some family salads w flavorful produce for four are $10-16!!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from Grimaldi's. I had never been. My oldest daughter wanted to take me out to lunch for my birthday so I said, \"Hey I've never been to Grimaldi's, I hear it's pretty good, let's try it\" We got a large pizza .. half with cheese and half without (she's vegan) and  we got 3 toppings we also shared a salad. The Sangria was excellent!! The gal who served us (we sat at the bar) was really attentive and helpful! It was an delicious enjoyable lunch. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Im definitely coming back:] Hit this place up last night and it was pretty busy, 30 min wait for patio seating, understandable since Boca Park is pretty busy friday nights, so we just ate inside. The staff was really friendly or should i say too friendly lol. I have two pictures attempting to take a picture of the pizza and my friend but i have a server hogging the camera instead haha. Good service though, It was our first time and our server explained the menu to us thoroughly.   Pizza was really good. If your into real pizza, not from pizza hut or domino's then this is the place to go. You basically order the base of your pizza and add toppings. We had basil leaves, ricotta cheese, mozarella cheese, and sun dried tomatoes on our pizza and it was yummy. I loved how the pizza was thin and crispy and wasnt drenched in oil, made my guilt go away for eating pizza late at night.   This place is definitely on my list for pizza.:]"}
{"text":"Not a puzza eater but will def come back. I love ny style pizza great place delicious food."}
{"text":"If we want to eat pizza, we always go to Grimaldi's Pizzeria. Honestly, their pizzas are the best you can get in the Phoenix area (at least to my opinion).  The crust is just phenomenal, I could just eat it by itself! It is a thin crust, so thick crust lovers out there, I'm not sure if this is your spot!  They have a nice selection of wine and beer, no hard liquor though (Not an issue for me.....). Their house wine is actually quite good (for $5..) The reason why I am not giving 5 starts is because of the service as well as the prices. The price of the pizzas can get high pretty fast, as each toppings is at least $2. The Personal Pizza is at $9 (which is just cheese and tomato sauce). I have never had an excellent service at Grimaldi's, especially when I am sitting at the bar. To be honest, as long as they keep serving me that pizza, I do not really care about the rest!"}
{"text":"I hate leaving anything but five star reviews. In fact- it seems to be the only reviews I ever post. But I felt I had to share my experience.   I had heard so many great things about Grimaldis, and I had been craving coal fired pizza for a while. We were anticipating this pie for quite some time, as we planned out a pizza night with our good friends a week prior to finally ordering.   I would like to disclose we did do take out. So that could very well be why our pie was unsatisfactory.  We ordered two large pizzas. One pepperoni and one veggie pizza. Our total was $50. This seemed on the higher side for two large pies, but we were okay with the price due to what we were anticipating. We picked up our two pizzas right on the estimated time, and brought it directly home. I live about five minutes away. We immediately served the pizza to our hungry pizza loving group to find that our pies were rather soggy. The outside of the crust (where you would hold the pizza) had a nice solid texture and char, but the rest of piece was Almost raw as you moved towards the middle of the slice. The dough underneath felt wet- If that makes sense? I couldn't even pick mine up because it had no form. In my past experiences with coal fired pizzas- I've never had one that was soggy. I was really sad because i was hoping for that crispy charred yet chewy crust. We kept in mind that this could have been because it was boxed to go- but I can't help but compare it to other pizzas I've ordered to go and did not have this same issue.  Also- our pies did not sit for long.   The pizzas were beautiful, and the size was nice.  It could have had an off night, but I don't think we will be ordering out from this spot again. Sad we had such mediocre pizzas.  Hope you all have better experiences!"}
{"text":"I'm no pizza expert but these folks know what they are doing.    Great thin crispy pizza, home made sauce, fresh toppings.  The staff was great.  We sat down and I immediately spilled a beer, they were great about it, moved us to another table, did not make a fuss, got me another beer and were kind in regards to my clumsiness.    I love the thin crust - the thinner the better.  It had a good texture and you can tell it's cooked in a REAL pizza oven.  I love that they care about their craft - it's a dying art...."}
{"text":"Ok...this place.  Wow! Loved everything about our visit.  Paolo was our server and was absolutely on top of everything even though it was a busy Saturday night.  And then there was the food...absolutely amazing!  We started with the bruschetta because we had it before and it was delicious.  Then, we went with The Don again and this time it was full of flavor.  It very well could be one of the best pizzas I've ever had...if not THE best.  I honestly have been thinking of that pizza since I left and can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this location while we happened to be on the \"west side\".  We were craving pizza for dinner, so we checked Yelp of course, and Grimaldi's did not disappoint.  I would have given five stars except for a couple of things that didn't quite make the visit perfect.  First off, we happened to arrive at a time when they were servicing their ovens, which was fine.  I get it.  Sometimes things have to be done to provide a good product.  However, when you say that the wait will be 45 minutes from when you order until you actually get the pizza, make sure it's 45 minutes or less.  Not an hour plus.  Luckily, knowing that the pizza would take awhile, we decided to order a Caesar salad and some bruschetta to enjoy while waiting and enjoy we did.  Both had so much flavor!  Absolutely delicious!  We couldn't wait to taste the pizza.  Instead of building our own, we decided to go with \"The Don\", which is topped with Italian sausage, meatballs, and pepperoni.  Sounds great, right?  Unfortunately, The Don didn't live up to his predecessors.  It was decent enough, but was really lacking in flavor.  I was expecting so much more.  All in all, this location is great.  Our server was excellent.  They have an extensive wine list.  The atmosphere is spot on and would be a great \"date night\" excursion before heading to see a movie. Wish I lived closer..."}
{"text":"Always fresh hot pizza.  We love this place.  Always our first choice.  Just the pepperoni and salad every time.  Great service."}
{"text":"Service excellent Mariah was awesome. Food was great! To bad the manager was into checking with his guest! He liked to hang put at the counter talking with cooks and service team. Didn't catch that the waitress dropped something on floor and didn't wash her hands - right in front of him. He was more in the way, standing in the pickup area - not expediting! Food is pricey but it is good! It's rich man's pizza."}
{"text":"There are two things one should not put up with. One of them is medicore, over priced Pizza.  This is a great place for a 21 year old guy to to take his 19 year old date, who he's trying to impress, by ordeing wine with Pizza, and letting her sneak sips of it.   Pizza is really hyped and not that good. Certainly, over priced. Long wait, and very arrogant staff.   Went with my then, Hipster Son, and his girl friend. They were impressed, I was not.  I ordered a Sausage Pizza, with double meat. Looks like they were running out of Sausage, and barely sprinkled the pizza. When I complained, the waiter just said, \"That's how it is\".   I would have been better off ordering a Pizza to go from Costco.   Never again!!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night and it was super busy. But the service was not bad for the amount of people that were in there. In addition to the sit down patrons, they also have a bunch of take out orders that they do. Our waitress was really cool there was an extra pizza that was sent back to the kitchen because it had olives on it and she gave it to us for free! I like olives.  Didn't have time to try the salad, but it loked good."}
{"text":"If you think this is \"NY style pizza\" , you're on drugs. In NYC there are about 3 chains exactly like Grimaldis, and the best of which is probably Patsys. I guess this place is OK as far as vegas standards are concerned, but if this is the best pizza you've ever had, i feel for you.   Do yourself a favor and drive down to Durango, right before the 215, and grab a pie from La Familia. Thank me later.   Side note: Went here about 3 months ago....service was terrible but the pizza was good."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into this place, it feels like you're in a pizza joint in NY. There's tons of pictures of NYC which gives it that authentic feel. The lights that they use are wine bottles handing from the ceiling and they look mighty nice. Now, lets get to the good stuff-the food. Their pizza is really good. The crust is amazing! We got a large pepperoni and mushroom pie. My kids really enjoyed the food and they're pretty picky eaters. Service was really good, I'm not sure what everyone else is talking about, but our waitress was very friendly and fast. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My family has always loved this placed but Thursday night kind of changed that.  Te service was great, our waitress was very sweet but something was different with the pizza. The sauce tasted different and very bitter and not much cheese at all. I know it is not the typical pizza with the cheese but there really was hardly any cheese on top. Our pizza also seemed to be burnt on the bottom as well. When we were leaving the hostess's didn't even acknowledge us. We could of ran our of there without paying lol."}
{"text":"I really, really want to like Grimaldi's more than I do right now but I can't. The pizza is good. Not the best you've had but it's certainly many levels above others. For the price I was expecting more."}
{"text":"I can't figure out why they have such high reviews. Especially after reading their reviews on their salads. My Mediterranean salad was awful! Lettuce was wilted, hardly any cheese and my tomatoes were mushy. Their dressing was full of raw onions. The antipasto appeared to be half of what it should be. Maybe they were hungry before they brought it out and ate some of it? The service was horrible.  And when we spoke to a manager they offered a $5 coupon for our next visit. Why would we go back? Definitely do not recommend."}
{"text":"It was good but not the best I had. Plus it took almost 1 hour to get our pizza. The place is super crowded and you get no room to stretch your arms. My pizza was a little soggy and salty. I think it's better to order to go I saw those pizzas coming out much faster."}
{"text":"I really loved this location, it was very nice inside, open and upbeat went on sunday night for my bday pizza and the food was so good and fresh it, had the Mediterranean salad and pepperoni pizza, wish i had some more right now lol.. it was very good, staff was great, can see them making the pizzas right there which was fun. Tirimisu is pretty good, the canoli we did not care for, I have had a couple canolis and liked them but the filling in this one was very thick custard corn starchy like to me, if they changed it to a light cream it would be great. Anyways we had a wonderful visit and a great server, will be going back soon"}
{"text":"It was good, but that's where it ends.  And no, I am not a New Yorker, and I don't think my pizza's s*** doesn't stink.  All I am saying is that it was good pizza and that is all I have to say.  I agree with a reviewer below ... the bathroom is terrible, and the service was ok.  Caesar salad was also ok, nothing spectacular.  I won't even mention what I want to say (which is that I can name a bunch of places back home that are better) because I will immediately get attacked by the zealots, but it's just my humble op.  :-)"}
{"text":"I was worried when I discovered that a New York landmark had sold out and decided to add locations outside NY, but happily this place has actually pulled off what I thought was impossible, bringing great NY pizza to Vegas. No doubt, this is some of the best pizza in town and that's pretty much what you're looking for in a pizza joint... Only complaints are that the restaurant can get crowded, and prices are a tad high (it is pizza after all). But these are just little things, if you are a pizza snob and haven't tried Grimaldi's yet make sure to put this place on your list."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a great place to go.  If your looking for a neighborhood pizzeria.  I live maybe 5 minute's from this place, and like every other place at Boca Park it has a fantastic patio experience.    The decor is really nice with the old wine bottles pretending to be chandeliers.  It's a lot bigger than would appear.  Me and the little sis had the usually sausage and mushroom and it was really good.  Seriously if your looking for a good pizza place with a good patio this is the place.  Plus after your meal you have a few places within walking distance to have a good time."}
{"text":"This was my last meal in Las Vegas after a very long three days for a trade show - and ya know what? It was delightful. I enjoyed the pizza very much. It's in a quiet little corner of the Venetian and while not the cheapest pizza I've ever had, they do a great job staying as close as they can to a New York style pie. If you want something quick and easy, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday and sat on the patio. Mostly leaving this review for ISABELLA because she was so sweet and gave us excellent service. We only ordered a pizza (but she did offer us salads of course) and had a birthday coupon and she was very nice and professional. It's always a plus with lunch to receive good service. And of course the pizza was as good as usual."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's pizza is probably one of the best pizzas I've eaten in awhile!  I love pigging out during vacation and luckily it was just my sister's birthday.  She had a coupon for a free pizza so we printed it out and presented it to them.  This was for one large pizza with one free topping!  Additional toppings range from $2-$5 depending on what you get.  We got pepperoni and mushrooms! yum!!  This large pizza is $16 and it is worth it, even if we didn't have a coupon.  I love thin pizzas so if you are not a fan and want more thickness, you may not like it.  They make these pizzas with fresh mozzarella cheese and you can see them make it through their glass windows. Andddd  i must say, this pizza was GINORMOUS!! We had to take 2 slices to go. We also ordered the Antipasto, which consisted of genoa salami, fresh mozzarella, oven-roasted sweet peppers, sicilian olives, and oven toasted crostini.  This was $9 for a regular size.  This was just an okay salad dish.  All this and only one basil leaf? :(  Overall, I love this place.  It is located in Venetian/Palazzo hotel.  Very nice decor and a great place for a date too!  I was so hungry later that night that I ate the leftovers...COLD and i must say, it was still delicious! Our server was super polite and very helpful too!  NOTE: -Sign up for email to get a free pizza on your birthday -MUST print out coupon and present (they do not take from phones)"}
{"text":"This place wasn't even going to get a rating.  It was busy on a Fri night around 7pm but the outside area had many a single table occupied with loads to spare.Quoted a 45 min wait.  Stood around a minute outside while thinking of another place to go when the , possibly on-duty manager, outside asked what was up , let her know and they said  to give them 10 mins to get the outside ready  which was much more agreeable. Things improved greatly after this.   Better pizza than average, same story with the salad and decent servings on the wine. Much better with children than expected.  Food is maybe 3 to 3.5* but the service made it feel like a 4* for the type of restaurant.  While unimaginative on the mushrooms, it's a source of amusement to see the care and attention that goes into making the base pie and then failing at the fungus stage ,with default 'shrooms was a wee bit sad. Not a great selection of beer, a bit better on the wine front but not by much.    Restrooms. You are kidding ? Yep there's 1 in the guys, 1 for the girls, and  not a lot of room to wait in. It's not the most toddler friendly set up."}
{"text":"We were seated fast, we had a very nice and attentive server named jake, drinks were served fast we ordered cheese pizza for daughter and the works pizza for me and hubs and a Caesar salad, shared a cannoli for dessert... everything was yummy and place is cute set up like New York I would return here again!!:)"}
{"text":"Came here on a commendation from a customer.  Well, again, they claim to be \"authentic\" Brooklyn style pie but I'd beg to differ.  Never had pie in Brooklyn where I needed a knife to get through the the crust...lol. It's a pretty thin, hard as cools - type of crust that gives you no chew whatsoever.  The over all flavor, not bad, but not worthy of a 4 or 5.    That said, I am a self-admitted pizza snob and can be quite critical. It's all to blame on where I grew up and the quality of pie I was surrounded by - obviously taken for granted for years until I moved to the southwest.    I'd recommend this place for a nice lunch as long as your expectations are in check.  We went to another pizza joint later the same day... That was memorable.  Read that review."}
{"text":"I was sick when I ate some take out pizza, but at that it was good.  I wish my taste buds where working better.  It was a solid pizza, no complaints."}
{"text":"Decent pizza.  Not the best in town, not the worst.  Don't go out of you way for it but if you're in the area and want a pie, you could do worse."}
{"text":"According to the hostess the ovens were \"running cold\" and the pizzas would take one hour,at least. The running \"cold\" explanation is totally ridiculous - both conceptually and practically. Hardly any people here and wait staff is just sitting around totally oblivious to the inconvenience this is causing."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now. When the place is packed and you eat in, the service can be pretty terrible. The pizza is decent. The ingredients are good quality so it makes for a good pizza. If the sauce wasn't so bland then I would have given it a 5 (despite the service) ordering for pick up works out great though. The sauce taste like it was just scooped out of a can of crushed tomatoes... BUT plain canned tomatoes can sometimes be better than some of the pizza sauces out there. I still think Settebello's is a better pizza."}
{"text":"I used to think this was the best place ever up until I showed up at 4 pm and the hostess told me there are no pizzas and they only serve salads. Very disappointed especially when I come to this place every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My wife and my daughter loved the pizza .. very thing crust. The small salads were huge . Very nice plate will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I called Halloween night, which also was Game 4 of the World Series with the Yankees so this place was busy.  I ordered 2 large pizzas to go and asked that they be \"uncut\" - this is for reheating purposes (it keeps cheese from spreading in your oven).  My husband went to pick them up and they sent him out with extras to apologize for cutting the pizzas.  Now that was really cool of them!  Thanks for the great pizza and happy memory."}
{"text":"This isn't our regular location (we live closer), but the weather was nice, so we dined al fresco, catching a small view of The Strip on an overcast day with minimal wind (that's rare).   The manager was very nice. Everyone working here was really nice, too. Our server was attentive and checked in on us a few times.   We had a small meatball pizza and a small ham calzone, which came with marinara sauce (we had leftovers). Our picky eater son loves the pizza, as a matter of fact, it is our family's favorite pizza! We never got the calzone before, but man, it was yummy- cooked perfectly, not mushy, not overfilled, just right. Why did we wait so long to try it? Because we love the meatball pizza! I'm almost forgetting to mention the pizza, what am I talking about? It's always good here!  Some years ago, I saw this place on Food Wars and instantly became a fan. We've been coming to Grimaldi's since our son was a baby, he's five years old. Oh, and our son stuck to the pizza, didn't even try the calzone. (True story, once we were stopping to purchase gift cards, our son insisted on getting pizza trying hard to yank me inside, but we had already eaten dinner.)  This is a pretty cool location. I know that there are others around the city, but our main one is at the Fashion Show Mall. Seems to be a busy location, as we came during the holidays to purchase the gift cards."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place from co-workers, seeing this place on the Travel Channel in Food Wars and other specialty food shows, and a couple months ago, finally got to try it.   The inside is very nice (not really what you'd expect in a pizza joint)- red/white checker topped tables, surrounded by framed pictures of New York City points of interest (bridge) and old-time celebs (Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin) on all the walls. There is a small bar. Also, there is seating al frasco, too. In one corner, there is a round table for a cozy get-together.  The service is pretty good- the staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is nice. It's a little small (but there is also seating at the Bar, and al fresco, too). The pizza is pretty good- thin crust, good sauce, good cheese. My husband & I shared a pie (had leftovers). I think, maybe, my husband (who is half Italian) thought it was good, but not spectacular. At the time, the baby wasn't eating too many solids, so we didn't share our meal with him. Funny story: the baby was having his bottle and he ended up falling asleep at the table, in the highchair.   About the Menu, choose the item and size- personal, small, large (pizza, calzone) and then select your toppings (which takes up half the menu- meats, veggies, extra sauce, basil, garlic, etc.). If you get any starters, it's several choices of salads. Also has desserts, cold drinks, and wine & beer.  I'm curious about the calzones. I could order it for pickup. I would definitely try this place again."}
{"text":"Pepperoni & Sausage pizza and a Sam Adams to wash it down with. Oh don't let me forget the Spinach salad. Everything was delicious! Service was very good too!"}
{"text":"It's very good pizza but coal fired is not really NY Style traditionally but that does not change the fact that the Pizza is good. Ordered the DON which is their meat pizza. Very good and nice thin crust. Caesar salad was decent. Reasonably priced for being inside the Palazzo. Limited wine selection but that is not their sweet spot anyways. Worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"I have celebrated multiple birthdays here and it's one of my favorites. I usually prefer a thicker crust to my pizza but this place is a delicious exception. The brick oven flavor is amazing and with all the topping available, there are really no bad choices. The only cavet I would have about the food is that it can take a long time to get the pizza to the table, but once you take a bit you will realize why.    The restaurant itself is smartly decorated but nothing flashy or distracting, your basic pizzeria stuff. While they do accommodate large groups, I would highly suggest making reservations, especially on the weekends. With a delicious place like this being located in Old Town, they are usually pretty busy. I have received nothing but the best service when I've eaten here so that never an issue. And as a heads up, if you have enough people, they will give you the private room in the back for your party. Convenient when it's your birthday and you want to pre game a bit before going out to the clubs haha.   If you're a pizza lover, like myself, check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"Got here at 6 pm. At 7:30 we still did not have our pizza. Asked for a garden salad with ranch dressing. Waitress said we don't have ranch. Thousand island? No?  French?  No. Italian? No, how about a nice red wine vinaigrette?  I don't like vinaigrettes. Sir, I'm sorry but all we offer are vinaigrettes. Ugh.  Plus we were seated outside and froze while waiting for our food to arrive. Pizza was marginal at best.  No plans to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. Crust is thin but has a good flavor, doesn't taste like a saltine cracker!!  We opted for the pesto on one of the pizzas and it was very tasty. My brother had the \"don\" and the meatballs were very fresh with a hint of fennel. Very impressive overall!  And I am a self proclaimed pizza guru!!!"}
{"text":"I have tried a couple of locations and this was my first visit to this one inside of the Pallazo.   Went a on a weeknight evening and we were promptly seated with a nice view of the Wynn.  Our server, Karen, was extremely courteous and attentive.   I love NY style pizza and I always go with this combination: white garlic pizza with ricotta and meatballs. It never dissapoints me.   Tip: you can sign up for their email offers and you get a free large pizza the week of your birthday."}
{"text":"I opened up the restaurant with the opening crew three years ago.  I started as a bartender there.  So Grimaldi's, to me, is more than just another pizza joint.    Grimaldi's is what true Italian cuisine is all about.  Stated simply, ingredients.  Use ingredients that are the best and in season in your region and you will have wonderful results.  Unfortunately, we are in the middle of the desert where nothing fun to eat grows.  Luckily, everyone ships to Vegas.    When something is so simple as dough, cheese and sauce, the ingredients have to be the best.  Grimaldi's has a supplier from Italy that imports their tomatoes for them; they even use bottled water to make their dough.  I would think that pizza made from Vegas water would have to be subpar.  We have the worst water I've tasted in the states.  Their toppings, ranging from the pepperoni to the Ricotta cheeses, are all superior to any I've tasted in town.     The artist who sculpts the pie also makes a huge difference.  The dough is hand tossed.  I loved watching the head pizza maker, at the time, dance the dough on his finger tips.  His pies were, by far, superior to pies made from some of the other pie makers.  The artist turns the pie while it's in the oven, moving it closer or further from the coals.  This helps to ensure a tasty crust.  There have been a few times when I've eaten there and the pie was delicious with a flaky crusty crust.  There have been other times when the pie was undercooked for my liking and not as crispy.  But, overall, an excellent pie with gourmet ingredients.  So Grimaldi's, to me, is a place of nostalgia and of mixed feelings of a different time in my life.  The little pizzeria, to me, is quintessential East Coast and Italy.  The former is where I grew up; the latter I dream of going.  I still love Grimaldi's to this day."}
{"text":"Other than a wobbly table, this place has great service, scrumptious pizza with best crispy crust ever and cheesecake to swoon over."}
{"text":"Not as great or as poor of a business establishment as I have read on yelp.  They definitely have tasty pies.  It's not the most conveniently prices items but hey it's not the most expensive either.  Secret pizza is still the place to go.  Yet, I'll still eat in Grimaldi's on ocassion."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite pizza joints. The food, service, ambiance are all 5 stars in my book!  Our go-to's: Caprese Salad and Margarita pizza with the basil added at the end and request for \"light cook\". The light cook makes for a softer & palatable crust. Since the crust is so thin, it tends to get hard or even burn a little during the cooking process so we always ask for \"light cook\".  The decor is pretty much New York themed. I like that they have Marilyn Monroe's photos and a few other things like the subway map, and various other b&w photos of NYC.   Don't forget to sign up for their mailing list, free pizza on your birthday!"}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious. We enjoyed a pizza which had an amazing crust. While the food was great, it was the service that was wonderful. The staff were so friendly and helpful. They made sure we had everything we needed for take out and thanked us for choosing their restaurant. I always appreciate great service."}
{"text":"One of my personal favorites in the Green Valley area, although they have a few locations around Nevada. Be prepared to wait on weekends and busy nights. But always a good pie and Peroni on tap.  Be aware you do pay a premium for a premium pizza. Nevertheless, it's worth the money. Perfect crust and an array of toppings like ricotta and artichoke. Fun place for a quick bite or a casual date night.   Oh and the antipasto is great!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has some good pizza dough and crust. I believe the first time, we got some type of fancy pizza, and it wasn't that great for some reason. I was advised that their regular pepperoni is good, so the next time around when we went back, we gave it a stab, and this simple Pepperoni with jalapeño pizza was much better.   I wish they put in a tad bit more tomato sauce in their pizza, but I definitely like the thickness of they crus (thin and crispy on the bottom). I've been here several times to dine-in, but the lats time when i got it to-go, the cheese on the pizza had hardened by he time I got home (10 minutes?). I'm not sure if the pizza was sitting out for 5 minutes before pick-up, but, it sorta ruined my experience. I tried heating it up in the microwave and it did not salvage the situation.   Hardened cheese on pizza is a no-go for me. I advise dine-in for their pizzas."}
{"text":"Pro: Pizza is delicious. Con: Pizza is expensive. I ain't gonna lie - I like my pizza fancy. Throw some artichokes, Kalamata olives, mushrooms, spinach, chicken, maybe even some bacon, and I'm in heaven. However, most pizza joints only offer the \"classics\". If you want a custom pizza, you've got to tack on $1-2 per item. That turns a moderately priced pizza into a $30+ monstrosity. We paid $32 for the pizza described above. My husband called and placed the order one night. I then drove to pick it up. The restaurant was packed and I had trouble finding the \"to-go\" area. Apparently, they have two entrances - which I was unaware of. The lesser known entrance is on the side, near the patio chairs. When you enter this way, you are at the to-go area. Since I came in the other door, I was able to view the entire restaurant. It was dimly lit, with classic red/white checkered table cloths. Customers seemed to be enjoying their pizzas and I was eager to take mine home. Once home, my husband and I dug into our expensive pizza. It was tasty and we ate the entire pizza. (It was a small...) While I did like the pizza, I can get the same pizza at other joints for less."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Ordered late at night for takeout back to our room. Great hostess and service. Had a meatball, sausage and pepperoni pizza. Waited at most 15 minutes and the pizza was hot and delicious. The one downside is they have no restaurants near where I live."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza!!  Thin crust, fresh toppings.  Delicious and delectable!!  My mouth waters just thinking about it!!  There is no Grimaldi's in Orange County, CA so I always have to get my fix when we go to Vegas.  This is the best.  A small pizza and  a salad is a sumptuous dinner!!  Service is great too.  Grimaldi's, please open a store in Orange County, CA!! :-)"}
{"text":"The husband and I stumbled onto Grimaldi's on our last trip to Vegas. It was so amazing that we ended up eating there twice during our trip (first at Fashion Show Mall, then at the Palazzo).   Grimaldi's has the best pizza I've ever eaten. The ingredients are top-notch. Fresh mozzarella, house-made sauce, delicious roasted red peppers. They make a decent ceasar salad as well (a small easily feeds 2 people, as an appetizer to a pizza). Great cannolis.   The location was super quiet when we were there (early dinnertime). At the back of the ultra-upscale Shops at the Palazzo, I'm guessing that this pizza joint isn't often busy. But the location is very nice and the restaurant's interior is new and casual, but still classy.  If you're in Vegas and looking for pizza, you MUST go to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"I don't know what I was eating before Grimaldi's, but it wasn't pizza. Hands-down, the best pizza of my life. In the Mid-West, we have a wide variety of pizza, from thin crust to thick, and even some deep-dish. But nothing compares to Grimaldi's brick-oven, thin crust, with fresh mozzarella and house-made sauce.   The husband and I were looking for some place to eat near the Fashion Show Mall, but we didn't want to eat in the food courts. Grimaldi's popped up on the Yelp app. The location is near the \"back\" of the mall (in relation to the Strip), but it's definitely worth the trek.  We ordered a ceasar salad (great salad, but not the best I've had) and a small pizza with pepperoni and red peppers. The peppers are amazing! We split a cannoli for dessert and it was one of the better cannolis I've ever had.   There is a fair selection of beers on tap and in bottles. Being from the Mid-West, there were plenty of West-Coast beer options that I'd never tried before.   Everything about Grimaldi's is awesome. Good salads, AMAZING pizza with quality ingredients, good beer selection, great desserts, classy but casual atmosphere, AND reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I don't know why other people are this place so high. I've eaten here twice and it's never great but never bad.   I ordered the small 16\" pepperoni pizza for $14... It said on the menu Hormel meat so I thought awesome I love Hormel pepperoni.  When the pizza came out... it came out nice and hot.  I asked for it well done so it was nice and crispy.    Negatives:   - The cheese they use looks weird and has an odd texture (in my opinion). - The pepperoni slices were too thick and no consistency in sizes and thickness... I don't like that.  Positives: - Good pizza.  Nothing spectacular - NOT Deep dish.   - Split between me and my hungry boyfriend... perfect size for 2  Mediterranean salad:  - Pretty fresh, some of the pieces of lettuce were wilted and red...  - split for 2 people is a good appetizer if you're not starving.  I would go back if nothing else appealed to me.  But definately not dying to go back."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch last week. I ordered take out though. The pizza was awesome. It was the first time I tried it and I was not let down. Its a very thin pizza but the crust is perfect. Very good. Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"We ordered take out and had extra sauce and ricotta cheese. Really good pizza! Also had cheesecake for dessert. Service was excellent and easy to park and pick up!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Completely obsessed. Me and my whole family. I suggest getting the antipasto, it is to die for. Forewarning the salads are huge."}
{"text":"Tonight was the worst dining experience we have ever had here at Grimaldi's. We were seated next to the rear door of the restaurant and the door opened & closed over 50 times from both adults & children going in and out, in and out, in and out... If they didn't leave the door propped open than they knocked for our daughter to open the door for them? Why is this even an option in a restaurant? The manager came over and asked if everything was okay and we told him that it wasn't and nothing was offered to us as compensation for our inconvenience?! The tables next to the door need to either be removed or the door should be used as only an \"emergency exit only.\" We have come to the DC Ranch location for years and after this evening's dining experience it's doubtful that we will ever be back there again. Very Sad..."}
{"text":"Very flavorful and delicious crisp NY style crust though a bit dry. Customer service was wonderful from the server to the manager."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Awesome Original Homemade Cheesecake!"}
{"text":"I first came to Grimaldi's on a third date, where I was an innocent victim, not realizing I walked into the crossfire of two boys and their pizza food fight.   One boy tried to hit the other boy with the pizza as it mistakenly came flying over to hit me in the arm.  Covered with sauce, their father came to my \"rescue\" with his filthy napkin and wiped my saucy arm.......clean???     Great start to a date hey!  haha    I loved the pizza so much this became one of my favorite places and favorite stories to tell.   The decor is always nice, the brick walls and wine bottle light fixtures are a great touch.  For the most part, Grimaldi's has been excellent at all of their locations.  For some reason, the Scottsdale Quarter location has been quite disappointing.  I usually order a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and extra basil and I love it!  However, it has been burnt the last few times and I don't mean a little burnt.  I mean where you bite into the pizza and it is really dry and crunchy kinda burnt.  Not sure if they have been overcooking the pizza or not putting enough sauce on it, but it has been exceptionally dry.    My favorite locations are Old Town Scottsdale and DC Ranch."}
{"text":"I love this place! The pizza is absolutely delicious and the service is usually quick. Definitely expect a wait for a table most nights, especially for a larger group. We love taking the kids here because they adore the cheese pizza (and so do I!) but also because they give the kids pizza dough to play with. My only complaint is that the patio only has highboy tables so we can never sit outside with the kids. Also - sign up for their emails so you get a free pizza around your birthday!"}
{"text":"Compared to some of the incredible local pizzerias we have in Phoenix, Grimaldi's doesn't even come close to showing off the potential of what good pizza can truly be. But, at the same time, in terms of chain pizza, I've found that Grimaldi's is one of the better options. I largely attribute this to their crust. Coal-brick does indeed give their crust a great flavor that you won't find at most places. Emphasizing this is very smart marketing on their part.  I'm not really a fan of \"build your own\" concepts and prefer places that have developed their own creations that you can experience by choice. Unfortunately, aside from a few rare exceptions, you're pretty much on your own at Grimaldi's. Be careful, because if you're the type who likes to dump a lot of crap onto your pizzas, your bill will quickly add up. I've jokingly said that someone should order every topping and create an 86 dollar large pizza just to see how god-awful it would truly be. Although I've found that keeping it simple with a basic pepperoni is all that's necessary.  Service is okay, but I always seem to recollect the time when I went here with a co-worker a few years ago. I asked the server what he would recommend for my pizza. He just looked at me like I asked him to recite all 44 U.S. presidents in chronological order. He had nothing! No suggestions and no guidance! He eventually shrugged and reluctantly stated, \"The chicken is pretty good, I guess...\" Seriously?      We had a terrible experience in Chandler, but that's a different story for a different day.    I'll gladly give them a solid four stars. Yes, there is better pizza available, but in terms of comparable \"chain pizza,\" it's probably one of your better options."}
{"text":"After our visit yesterday I am still disappointed!!  We have gone a few times in the past year and the service has been disappointing as well.   The pizza is offered without toppings and it's lacking in flavor.  One must use the Parmesan and pepper!  We ordered personal pizzas which are $12-14 alone and if you want any toppings they are 2-3 dollars each.  My moms personal pizza ended up to be $24.  Not a good value.  We've tried a few times and this will be our last visit.   Too bad because the location is nice.   We will visit one of the many other choices in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Grimaldi's and it was probably the best pizza we have had in a long time. The Caesar Salad was unbelievably good. We also had the Banana Cheesecake, OMG!!! It was the best cheesecake I've had in a long time. We definitely recommend this yummy place!"}
{"text":"BRYNA was wonderful, it was very busy especially on a Friday night. However there was a confusion with our orders and they made up for it with some free pizza. Can't complain about free anything.. and she was wonderful."}
{"text":"I heart this place!! I could pretty much eat pizza everyday, especially Grimaldi's!  My son received a free large pizza coupon via email so we ventured off to Boca Park.   After getting lost (Since we only moved here  months ago) we found this gem, its located in a great area and my son loved the fountain. We were greeted by 2 nice girls who seated us quickly. They gave my son a ball of dough and away he went throwing it in the air like the pizza makers. Our server was very nice and took our order, which only took about 10 minutes to get.  The pizza wasnt pipping hot, but luke warm, which was ok for my son but I wouldve rather it be warmer. I love the cheese on the pizza and the sausage was yummy. We added Parmesan cheese to the top, which made it suuuper yummy! Overall the whole experience was good, the pizza was good and the service was nice. We only ended up paying 2 dollars plus tip for a large 2 topping pizza (because of the bday coupon) so thats always a plus!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch with my good friend, Tim Engel at this restaurant. There was good food, good service, and great company.... but... do not go here if you expect WIFI. They have it, but do not give access to paying customers, even regular employees. it's only for management. I'll probably not return unless I'm in an isolationist mood."}
{"text":"Overall good dinner.  But nothing blew me away.  Pizza was good, cannoli was average, soda was watered down.  Server was great and I liked the atmosphere.  Price was good too."}
{"text":"We visit regularly and love the pizza! Service has always been great and the Oreo cheesecake is the best I've had!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would rate this as 3 1/2 stars (rounded down since it took forever for the bartender to give me the billfor my to-go order).  I was staying at The Palazzo, so I wanted to get something to eat within the hotel complex. I ended up getting a small pizza with sausage and mushrooms. I got te pizza to go, so it was not as ho when I finally ate it. It was pretty good, though, with a crisp crust (NY, not Neapolitan style). It was 14.00 for the pizza, plus 2.00 each for the toppings."}
{"text":"After trying the original in NY, and after so many outstanding brick oven pizzas back home, I would have to drop this one just a notch down---just something about mall restaurants.  Ordered the pan pizza size for the Margherita, while good, it was actually even better considering that the nice fella at the front gave me a $5 coupon, after coming back a few times.  Apparently, their brick ovens needed some more time to heat up.  Went to the bar on the right for takeout, pretty efficient, and fast, just 10 minutes.  Decor-wise, it does resemble a bit New York with the checkered red/white table cloths.  Located ground level across from Nordstrom's.  Just don't think it's worth the 30-min lineup, who knows, maybe because of the holiday season."}
{"text":"I'm so torn on this review...I like the pizza at Grimaldi's. It's not life changing good, but it's very good. I especially like their crust, you can tell they have good pizza ovens.  You walk in and you feel like you're in an old school Italian place...Pretty cool. Red checkered table cloths, Sinatra type music playing, you get the drift. Service is attentive and usually pretty quick. Even if the restaurant is busy they seem to staff it appropriately so your food won't take forever. The wait to get in can be really long, especially on weekends in the fall and winter (AKA tourist/snow bird season).  The thing that kills me about Grimaldi's is the price. It's expensive for what you get. The prices seem reasonable when you sit down, there are different price points for the different sauce options (red/white/pesto), and a large pizza is base priced at $18. Doesn't seem bad, but that's just for sauce and cheese. It's when you start adding toppings that your bill will skyrocket. For example: I came here a few weeks ago and we ordered a large pesto based with grilled chicken and artichokes on half (side note: If you order a topping only on half, they will still charge you the full price for that topping...Seems like price gouging to me, but whatever). This pizza ended up being $27+ tax and tip, and that was for two toppings. If any of you are interested in doing a supreme style pizza, be prepared to take out a loan to pay for it.   Overall the pizza, service and ambiance are good, though it's overpriced in my mind. Grimaldi's is still hands down the best pizza option in Old Town, and I will almost certainly be back at some point."}
{"text":"Limited review .. Have only done take out n have only ordered the pies ... The pizza has been consistent, flavorful, thin/crispy'ish, good dough n lil burnt bits that are consistent w the brick oven n relatively normal. Have to remove a star cause smtimes the staff is a lil slow motion :)"}
{"text":"OMG this pizza is to die for! Had an excellent server-- I think her name was Tracy. She was excellent! She told us a lot about Grimaldi's and how they really went out of their way to make sure that the pizza you get in Brooklyn is the identical pizza you get in Vegas (and soon LA... she said 5/2013). Everything was really delicious and hands down the best pizza I've ever had! We made our own Large with pepperoni, olives, sausage and extra cheese. SO GOOD. You've GOT TO TRY THIS PIZZA and get on their bday mailing list :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful ambiance.  The place was packed on a Monday evening."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at any other location, including the one closest to me in LA, but it now seems I eat there every time we come to Vegas.  I like the pizza here a lot, especially the chicken sausage - it's really good. Is it the best pizza I've had? No. But it's definitely really solid and its in my favorite hotel in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service by Mike! The pizzas were exceptional, the Chardonnay was incredible, and when we accidentally left our leftovers at the table, the manager came running after us when we were driving away. Thank you for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"We highly enjoy their caprese salad and the wood smoked pizza is delicious. Love that they have a patio to sit outside!"}
{"text":"Did I like this place? yes and no. I came here with my husband, three children, two sisters, a niece, a nephew, and two brothers-in-law. I thought the food was pretty good, except for the fact that there was clearly a cheese shortage. Ordering extra cheese wasn't enough. I suppose you would have to order extra, extra, extra cheese if you wanted to actually taste the cheese on your pizza. Oh well, the flavor was good. The white pizza with garlic and mushrooms was excellent. Wow, I would definitely order that again.   Here's the problem with the place - it was REALLY uncomfortable. First of all, when we arrived they made us stand at the front with a bunch of young children until every single person in our party arrived. That policy is extremely irritating for people with young children or elderly in the group. There really wasn't a good place to sit and wait, but we did our best crammed in by the front door. Once everyone arrived, they brought us to our table. That's when things got worse.   The table was REALLY bad. We were so crammed in that we could barely move. I dreaded each time that a child had to go to the bathroom, or that I had to stand up to do something. I must have banged into the people behind me ten times. I know that table hated me, but come on, I wear a size 4 -- I should be able to stand up to do something briefly and sit down without shoving my behind in anyone's face. That's not asking for too much room. To my dismay, most of the time I banged the chairs at adjacent tables, and found myself apologizing over and over throughout dinner. I was tempted to stand up and just move our entire table, but thought that would make a scene, so I didn't.   The food was pretty good. The atmosphere was terrible. I might come here again with just one friend, but I would be careful when agreeing to sit at a particular dining table. Decent food, but an uncomfortable dining experience."}
{"text":"5 stars ... Both service and the food was amazing ! Never ate here before and been hearing about it so we decided to go last minute at 10pm .. Was kinda skeptical coz they close at 11 .. Afraid that the service would be shitty coz we're the annoying guest that comes near closing .. but yet we still walk in .. Who eats pizza at 10pm on a Sunday ? Haha anyway .. We get seated and right away was greeted by our server Alex .. Told him we've never been here and he took the time to explain \"the works\" at Grimaldi's .. Very helpful ! We ordered Half white with sausage and ricotta and half pepperoni .. Pizza comes out and Alex apologizes because he messed up our order .. Before I could even respond he said he made a mistake and made a personal pepperoni fresh out to make up for it .. Score ! Two pizza's for the price of one ! Funny thing though out of all the Pizza's our favorite happened to be the *accidental haha .. Thanks Alex for messing up our order .. We found our new favorite combo .. We'll definitely be back at this location .. Even though they were closing we didn't feel rushed in fact they kept asking us how was everything and to take our time .. The hostess was very attentive too ! Sorry for the book but yes believe the hype .. Grimaldi's is a must try !"}
{"text":"Here in Scottsdale for spring training. This place recommended by the hotel concierges. The salad was HUGE and so tasty ! The pizza was delicious . We had the \"Don\". The crust was chewy , crispy and so good . Service was also very good ."}
{"text":"Located at the west side of the Boca Shopping center. My server, Keith says this restaurant is affiliated with the original Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge.  Italian Sausage and Mushroom pizza Setting is warm and inviting. Warning, the small pizza is a generous size (for an individual serving)"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, the best pizza ever! I always order a margherita pizza or \"the don\" with fresh garlic and fresh basil added. The crust is light and crispy and the sauce is very flavorful. The spinach and kale salads make a delicious accompaniment. If you join their online club, you get a free pizza on your birthday!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch there yesterday.  As far as pizza goes. I typically love there's however tried the white pizza yesterday & didn't love it (it was just OK).  But our waitress was great.  We had Katie & she was very personable, very on top of everything and we had a delightful new years eve late lunch out on the patio.  I will go back to this location over others solely based off of the great service we had."}
{"text":"This is a great family place! They give you a ball of dough to play with for the kids. I love the meatball and pesto pizza and the house wine is great to drink as well! If you go try to go before they change over to supper that is when the real deals happen!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but didnt amaze.  Not a fan of those some sauce here, some cheese there type pizzas... prefer a more even spread.  My biggest gripe was the rip off upcharge of toppings... $2-$5 per topping.  $2 to add onions to your pizza??  On a positive their cheesecake was really good and their desert and drink menu was pretty decently priced."}
{"text":"Pizza! Pizza! Pizza! I like the selection. Though it is not extensive, you can choose sauce pizzas or pesto pizzas. And pile as many toppings as you like.   We tried the pesto pizza with olives and mushrooms and boy was that delicious. After they sprinkled some garlic on topic I was in pizza bliss. The thin crust was delicious - definitely not cracker-like.  The salads are nothing special, but nothing completes a pizza meal than salad.   It was a slow morning, so service was awesome. I cant' vouch for busy nights."}
{"text":"We had a caprese salad and pepperoni and jalapeno pizza. All was good. We lost a little of the ambience when we were seated in \"patio\" which was a view of the strip mall. Still, food and service was good."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found in Vegas yet. I with that the crust was a touch thicker, but it's good. The calzones are pretty good to share as well. All in all, it's pretty darn solid stuff."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a coal fired pizza joint and all I can tell you is that coal fired pizza is now officially my favorite type of pizza!  I found it to be a little weird that they do not offer any specialty pizzas - you have to create your own with toppings sauces etc, but its kind of cool-  my fiance and I have made a different pizza every time we have been there.  They also have pesto sauce as an option for a sauce which is amazing.  I am not a super red sauce fan so it is nice to have another option when it comes to pizza sauce!  The pizza's are a little pricey but keep in mind a large pizza is only 2 dollars more then a medium pizza- so go for it and take the left overs home!"}
{"text":"Awesome pesto pizza!  Fresh brewed iced tea..  very quick service.  Dreya is very efficient and friendly.  Great old style pizza place. Classy"}
{"text":"Had a nice gift certificate for pizza, $50.00 which was great.   Decided to use it with guests so we ordered two  pizzas.    I am not a pizza snob, but these were way below my expectations for a $50.00 worth of pizza!!   The crust was not well done and the blackened part was quite bitter to taste.   The pizza sauce was so mediocre that I think Ragu had more taste.    All in all this was a disappointment to me and I'd really think twice about giving them $50.00 for two basic pizzas again.    The $8.99 pizza from the Bashas brick oven is far more tasty to me."}
{"text":"In the mood for pizza and they delivered bigly! ;-) Had been to the Grimaldi's in Chandler, but not the Peoria location. Pizza tasted the exact same and was given excellent customer service for my take out order. Will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"This is the second time we have sat with Brian and enjoyed every minute! He was very busy with several parties yet made it a point to have people bring what we needed. When he did make it to the table he recognized us from before even though it had been a while. Love servers like this. I work in the business and know what it takes to make customers happy. This is defiantly a server to keep! Thanks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Pro: Close enough to CES Venetian location. Hidden corner, GREAT pizza, good selection of wine. Their own bathroom. Fair price.  Con: So so staff (I think she is new)  Bathroom: Clean, not family friendly.  Came here on the 3rd day of CES - our group was whiny, tired, and downright pain in the ass to deal with... After googling for a decent food join that WAS NOT A BUFFET. Grimaldi's came up, and since we were right outside of their door, it was the best choice for us due to we are lazy bums that don't want to walk anymore.  Got two pies, can't remember what they were, but it did the job of keeping us from burning down crappy Chinese booths following the meal."}
{"text":"Where do I start?  Been there 2 times and both times were not good. First time we went was right after they first opened. There were 2 of us and we seated in a tiny table against a brick wall...not the most likeable spot. We waited quite a while for a waiter to come to our table. Funny, cause there were about 6 waiters and helpers standing on the side chatting and not helping anyone. Finally, a waiter came over and took out order: 2 ice teas and a medium pepperoni pizza...pretty simple.  We received the drinks right away and after a bit of a wait, we received a plain cheese pizza. We told the person who delivered the pizza (it wasn't the waiter) that it was the wrong one. He said he would find our waiter and take care of it...10min later...the manager happened to stop by and we told her what happened. She apologized and said she could make a new one, but it would take another 15-20 minutes more. We decided to just eat the pizza we had instead of waiting. She didn't even \"comp\" the pizza for the screw up.  We never saw our waiter until we got the bill, we had to ask another waiter to refill our drinks and get our waiter...HORRIBLE SERVICE.  The pizza was ok, but definitely not worth the $$.  NYPD, Streets of NY, or Barro's pizza was better.  I wrote an email to the manager after I got home about the lousy service.  Didn't hear back from her for 4 days and I get this \"canned\" response letter that they said to bring in a small group of friends and they would make sure it was better service...blah blah blah. Should have fixed the problem where we were there.  Decided to try it again (had a coupon): 2nd time was for takeout...another simple order: 2 topping large pizza. Ordered it over the phone, got there right it was supposed to be ready and waited 10 minutes for a manager to approve the coupon cause the waiter had to get manager approval.  Got home and the pizza was a greasy mess underneath...was real nasty. The grease was leaking through the box. The dough was soggy and not good. Called to speak to the manager, and was put on hold. After a while on hold, I gave up and wrote the manager an email about the problem...3 days later no response. Send the email the company president...no response for either. I guess they really don't care. ....they'll be out of business soon if they keep this up."}
{"text":"Arrived at the palazzo location and the waiter provided horrible service. The salad was good but the pizza took forever and the waiter was sad. Pizza was average and tasty. Had to ask for refill of iced tea and waiter left dishes on table. Sadly asked what i was drinking after asking. The waiter made up excuses but did apologize. Customers want prompt service a full beverage quality food and good service. These folks failed at the Palazzo location. Place seemed mismanaged."}
{"text":"Very good service! We had the antipasto for app. The mozzarella cheese was delicious. We had the 16\" inch with my favorite toppings, which included Italian sausage, pepperoni, green peppers and extra mozzarella cheese! Yummy! For dessert we had the blueberry cheesecake which was ok. Other than that everything else was good. Esp the service"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Great service. Went during their happy hour. Don't forget to get the cheesecake. Really creamy, really good."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but not worth the price.  Also, they do not have a kids menu, so if you want to order a pizza for your kid, you gotta pay full price for a small one that he will only eat a slice of.  If you have kids, then you know they are NOT going to want the kind of pizza you do, so don't give me that just share crap.  All in all an ok experience, and the pizza was decent, not as good as The Deli in Queen Creek (see my review for it) The service was great, but my only complaint is price and the kids menu thing.  Just 3 of us, pizza and salads was over 50 bucks .... FOR 3 people - one of which was a KID.......  I probably won't go back because there are more kid friendly places with better and cheaper pizza."}
{"text":"The place is full of picky people (from what I could hear by the customers around our table) and the pizza was nasty, dry, and very overpriced. My salad wasn't good and cost an arm and a leg. The place was clean I'll give it that, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Always great pizza especially the way they cook it in the wood fired oven! Great service and always nice."}
{"text":"I was grateful that the manager, Jose, was so accommodating for my business. Our employees love the pizza here."}
{"text":"Coming from someone who LOVES thick crust, I never thought I would enjoy this pizza but I wish I would have gave it a chance sooner!! I want all the money back that I ever gave to pizza hut, domino's, papa johns, ect. Because I feel cheated!! Let me just say that before i tried this place, I was very picky about my pizza toppings. Pepperoni only for me. Never liked mushrooms, never had meatballs or basil on my pizza. First time I tried all of these on a pizza was at Grimaldis & let me tell you it was the BEST pizza I ever had! Now guess what I order every time I come here?? Yep I'm pretty sure I'm addicted. Also had the Caesar salad which was very fresh & tasty. It is a MUST TRY! Best pizza you will get in Vegas. This place is now a regular for me. I dined in once, good service. Now I do take out for those \"stay in bed and get fat\" days. 5 stars !!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza chain restaurant located in the suburban area of Eastern Ave.  The restaurant decor looks like an old pizza parlor straight out of New York. The staff was very friendly and seated us immediately. Our waitress was very friendly and fast.  You can build your own pizza or order a specialty pizza. The pizza was out in less than 20 minutes. It was very good."}
{"text":"Love the pizza! Would have given more stars if my waitress Sarah weren't so bad. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"There pizza was great. The price point is good for the quality of the pizza.  Quality pizza 4stars.   Megan was our server and she made quite a few mistakes. There was plastic in our sauce (we did get that dish completely refunded without complaining to have the cost of the dish removed) and she had to be reminded to bring us several things. It certainly was not her day. She also tried to flirt with us several times to get more tips. Nice try.  Service 2 stars  I asked for extra olive oil to put on my pizza. They had extra containers on the side. I was very disappointed at the quality of the olive oil. It was probably the cheapest you can find. It was almost like oily water. They had good Parmesan on the side. Additional service 2 star   The lighting of the place was good after it turned dark. It became difficult to see my pizza. For some reason they don't have almost any lights where we sat. It was pretty close to the entrance.  Ambience and lighting 2stars  My advice: I didn't feel it was worth to eat at the place. Everything was pretty bad except the pizza. I ordered a margarita.  If I ever go back I'll order a pizza to bring home."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Grimaldi's location after hearing so much about the restaurant.  I would have provided more stars if the service didn't slow down drastically.  Everything was good until we took our order.  We waited forever for our salads...  then waited forever for our pizza.  The menu states that they have a water filtration system to make the pizza taste New York style.  I didn't taste anything different - just tasted like regular pizza to me.  We never received our bill and had to finally just give my credit card to the Server to ring through our bill.  I believe he may have just forgotten about us.  Disappointed considering that I had heard so much about this restaurant."}
{"text":"My godsister, a friend, and I stopped by Grimaldi's recently.  I'm from Texas, but my godsister is a local of Las Vegas.  She recommended the place, and, if you can't trust a local's recommendation, whose can you trust?  This is a great place to enjoy a tasty pizza cooked in a coal-fired oven.  Whether you are by yourself, on a date, or hosting a kids' pizza party (I was sitting next to all three!), Grimaldi's can handle it.  The service was pleasant, helpful, and really quick on the refills.  And the pizza came out really quickly.  I think we ordered, I went to wash my hands, sat back down, and BAM!  The pizza was there.  Or, at least, that's how I remember it.  The pizza hit the spot.  The crust was crisp and also soft.  The mozzarella came from balls as evidenced by the circular spots of cheese on the pizza.  And the sprigs of basil on the pizza added a pleasant note to the overall taste.  Great stop on my weekend trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and Cj in fact was just awesome! The pizza we picked up came our just as asked and expected."}
{"text":"What's the hype about? I've never asked a pizza place for salt before, but I did here because the pizza lacked flavor. I ordered a pizza with 3 toppings, one of which was baked basil. But they forgot the basil and brought me a bowl of basil. They kindly offered to remake the pizza, but we have a 1-year old. I don't necessarily have the luxury of waiting an additional 20 minutes so that they can get the order right. They so graciously gave us the bowl of basil free of charge. Good customer service would have knocked at least 50% of the cost of the pizza off since they screwed up. The servers were friendly, so there's that. But we wouldn't come back by our own choosing."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly environment! As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very nice lady, it was our first time coming there which we mentioned to them. She explained the history of Grimaldi's and told us she been eating here since we was young girl. The server explained the  whole menu and we were even given a free sample of the the caramel apple cheese cake, that was amazing! Okay the pizza was really good but I just didn't get that super wow that everyone made it to be. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Got the Brooklyn bridge cause I love sausages. Also ordered a large Caesar salad to share for 3 people but the salad was really big so a small order of salad would have been better for the 3 of us. Also ordered their red Sangria to go along with the pizza. They only serve wine and beers here. We dined outside cause it was nice weather. Pizza is very big and filling. Also ordered the trio dessert with cannoli, cheesecake, and tiramisu. Yum"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints. If you like thin crust NY style pie, then this is a must try. And, that is pretty much all they do, pizza, calzone and a few salads... So they do them well. Tip: don't let the word small on the salad menu fool you. A small salad can easily be split among 2 adults.  It's not a large place and it is very popular because it has great pizza, so there is almost always a wait at dinner time. The do have beer and a large wine selection, many available by the glass. Our service has always been amazing, even at the busiest dinner rush times."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, excellent thin crust pizzas! Ask for side of marinara sauce for extra dipping. Also loved the Caesar salad with chicken - very fresh.  Friendly and excellent service by Nate, Daniel, and Austin.  Nate gives great recommendations!"}
{"text":"We had a nice meal. My husband and I split a small pizza and a calzone.Being from the New Jersey area, we thought we'd never have a good pizza or calzone again. Portion's were good, actually more than we could eat. We brought half home along with a dessert trio of a cannoli, cheese cake and tiramasu. These portions however were small and expensive in my opinion. Pizza was thin crusted with a nice crush  Calzone was my favorite  I asked to have more ricotta then mozzarella ( I don't like to chew and chew mozzarella! Anyhoo. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"After searching around for a restaurant tonight, we decided to go to Grimaldi's.    All I can say is that it was the best choice for food the entire time I have been in Las Vegas this week.  I'm not a huge pizza eater, but this was the best pizza I have ever had.  The service (our server was Anthony) was excellent.  He is very knowledgeable on everything on the menu and was very attentive to our dining needs.  If you want great pizza, then Grimaldi's is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious, no doubt.  I loved that the pizzas were made with organic ingredients and made to order.  I had the chicken, spinach, ricotta, white pizza.  The greek salad was perfectly seasoned and tasty.  The server was also knowledgeable and friendly.  The only downfall...it was over $100 for pizza for a family of four.  We did have to wait for about 30 minutes for a table, but understandably it was a Friday night."}
{"text":"Heard about place from tv. We went to grimaldi's the first day we went to vegas. Was looking forward to it and was not dissappointed. At first we thought it was a fancy pizza place but once in there pricing was very good. We ordered a large and small pizza and a house salad. After eating this kind of pizza it will be very hard to eat anything other kind!!. It was soooo good. Even the salad was good; it had the freshest, crispiest lettuce i have had. The dressing on house salad was perfect!. Would definately eat here again and recommend to everyone!. The pizza was not overly sauced which made it great. The cheese and toppings were also very fresh. Again; 2 thumbs up for Grimaldi's Pizza"}
{"text":"Lived in NY/Brooklyn for almost a decade and the pizza here is the same as the one in Brooklyn.  Cleaner and more spacious.  No need to wait 1-2 hours (in Brooklyn)."}
{"text":"Great service, nice outdoor seating, open late.   The caesar salad was really good, but the pizza was just okay.   Based on yelp reviews I was expecting a really delicious NY style pizza but it wasn't that great...Ordered a small peperoni, jalapeno, mushroom pizza but the jalapenos weren't fresh, they were the pickled kind so that kinda sucked.   The small pizza and small salad is plenty for 2 people.  I recommend giving Grimaldi's a try, but I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Very good service. I thought I was in a family owned place, that's how nice everyone is there. The pizza is very good as well! They have a great email club, a free pizza on your birthday! Plus plenty of offers during the year as well. I should also mention that the leftover pizza is good the next day! So if you are in the area, stop in. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"I came to this place last Wednesday for dinner. Me and my friend have never been here before and we have heard good things about Grimaldi's, so, we decided to give it a try. We ordered the large pesto pizza with itallian sausage on one half of the pie. My friend had a water to drink and I tried the passion fruit iced tea.    Now the atmosphere is nice with the lighting a little on the darker side for a nice reaxing feel to it. Now I wasn't to keen on the drink I ordered so I just asked if I could switch it out with a Pepsi or Coke instead. That wasnt a problem. But while my friend and I were waiting for our pizza we were talking and trying to conversate. Unfortunately we were sat right next to the kitchen where they were making all the food, and as my friend was talking, I could barely hear her or make out was she was saying because of the banging noises and cooking that was going on right next to us. I'm sure any other table would have been fine, but because we were sitting adjacent to where the noise is, I was just annoyed a little bit about that.    When we did get our pizza though, it was definitely delectably delicious (LOL try saying that three times fast). It was a nice NY style thin crust pizza that me and my friend enjoyed very much. Is it the best pizza ever? Naw, not to me. The secret pizza place in the Cosmo is a better NY style pizza joint in vegas to me. But, I did enjoy Grimaldi's Pizza and I will definitely come back again. I had the Pesto so I'll try the White with garlic next time i come here.    The only other real minor complaint I had was that I never got a refill on my beverage. I left my glass at the end of the table so they could see that it was empty, and our waitress never noticed it until we were already done eating. And by that time, I didnt even want a refill anymore because that would be a waste of soda. I guess that's my biggest pet peeve when it comes to restaurants. You don't need to come by every 5 mins, but you should come by and check on the guests every so often to see if they need anything. Customer service is just as important, if not more important than the food the restaurant is serving."}
{"text":"Can you say Ricotta Cheese??  This place has put it on my list of items I must have on a pizza or else..haha.  Everytime I am in Las Vegas, I have to make a trip to this Brooklyn Original Pizza place.  It's a must eat.  I have to order the pizza with ricotta.  The thin crust with the cheese is a perfect pair.  I am ruined Grimauldi's-you have ruined me, for the good of course!"}
{"text":"I would like to give Grimaldi's higher praise, but it just wasn't as good as I had hoped.  I knew of their reputation long ago, since I occasionally have business in NYC, but never made it to the original restaurant.  Plus, you can find good pizza on pretty much any corner in the city, so there's no need to make a special trip.  The service here was lovely, but the food was so average that I don't really know what to say.  We had a salad, which was decent, and a cheese pizza that was also decent.  The coal oven does give it a unique flavor, but it wasn't my thing.  Again and again I say, Pino's is the best pizza in town, and everything else just disappoints me."}
{"text":"Man people talk too much. This restaurant is just damn good. They don't have chicken wings and mozzarella sticks. Just pizza and a few salads and they are all great  And I'm always satisfied with that"}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite food and Grimaldi's definitely hits the mark. My boyfriend and I just happened across this place as we were walking through the Venetian, and made it a point to come here based on the reputation of the New York location. Going in, I was a little confused about what to expect because the restaurant is set up to look like a casual, fast pizza place, but mixed with fine dining. For example, they had checkerboard/picnic blanket table cloths, but each table had a couple of wine glasses. I wasn't sure where on the scale of Little Caesars to artisan pizza this was going to fall.   Thankfully, there was no wait here, unlike what I've heard about the New York location. We were seated right away and the hostess was very accommodating when I asked to be seated at a table other than the one she initially pointed out. I really liked the table that we did sit at, because we could look out of the restaurant and see the crystal decorations of the Venetian.   Our server was with us right away as well and quickly brought out water with ice upon our request. He let us take our time to figure out what we wanted to eat, and even suggested a small salad while we decided.   We chose the Caesar Salad, and as our server suggested, it was more than enough for the two of us. It was also really tasty; I almost forgot to take a picture of it before it was all gone. The lettuce was fresh and the dressing was evenly tossed. The croutons were also really great, large pieces and very crunchy. The salad was topped off with fresh shaved parmesan and our server also helped us with some cracked pepper. Very good start to the meal.  The pizza menu does not have many preset combinations eg. veggie/meat lovers. Instead, they have a basic crust with sauce and cheese (prized on size)  and you can add on toppings for $2-$4 based on what they are. I believe the cost of the topping is regardless of size of the pizza you choose. The are based on \"premium\" vs \"regular\" topping eg. artichoke vs extra cheese. They also have an option of red or white sauce and a pesto option.  For our pizza, we knew we wanted Italian Sausage on there right away, but for the rest of the toppings, we were a bit more selective based on each others' preferences and the quickly increasing price. I consented to Pepperoni while my boyfriend allowed for the Fresh Sliced Roma Tomatoes. We also got the Fresh Baby Spinach, Fresh Garlic, and Extra Mozzarella Cheese. We ordered it all on a small size (16 inch) pizza, which was enough for the two of us.  It did take a while for the pizza to come out, but we enjoyed our time watching from the window. When the pizza arrived, I was so excited because it was bigger than I expected, and it also smelled and looked amazing. I consider myself to be a pizza genius now, because the combination of toppings we had picked out worked so awesome together. I know, it's just a basic meat pie, but I thought it was almost mind-blowing. The sausage was very traditional and tasty and complemented their famous sauce very well. I also loved the spinach on the pizza and wish there had been more. The garlic really made the dish for me, I really looked forward to the bites where I could see little clusters of garlic. Really, each bite was packed with flavor and I could not stop eating.   Even though I was completely stuffed after the pizza, I wanted to order the Tiramisu because my boyfriend had never had it before. While it was not the best tiramisu I have ever had, it was quality dessert and a very good first try for my boyfriend. We both enjoyed how creamy the mascarpone was and how moist the ladyfingers were.  The highlight of this experience was definitely the pizza (as it should be) and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. With the personalization of the pizzas, everyone can get something they love."}
{"text":"It turns out my previous review was a one-time disappointment - which is a relief since this is our absolute FAVORITE pizza place! We've been back many many times since and received the same incredible food and service (we lovvve the servers here) that originally made us fall in love with Grimaldi's. :-)  Food: The crust on their pizza = perfection! If you're a dipper like me - Grimaldi's doesn't have ranch dressing, but I've found their casear dressing works great as a dip for the pizza crust. We always get a small Caesar Salad as an appetizer. Their salad is simple yet delicious and the 'small' size will easily feed 2 - 3 people as a side dish.  In addition to food and service, we love the atmosphere here: dim lighting with wine-bottle chandeliers and cool decor on the inside, or on summer evenings when it's not too hot take advantage of the cute outdoor patio!"}
{"text":"I really was expecting for this Grimaldi's location to fall way short. I have high expectations when it comes to Grimaldi's pizza. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed though!   The staff was efficient, the ambiance was touristy but fun, the food was served quickly, and the prices were as expected. There isn't much fuss happening over the food here - just good pizza served quickly and hot. The caesar salad was good too!   I was surprised that this location was pretty dead every time we walked by. I hope it stays in business for a long time. Damn fine pizza on the Strip, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend. We were warmly greeted by the hostess and she asked if whether we would like to sit outside, bar, or somewhere inside. We at first wanted to sit outside in the patio but there weren't any available tables at the moment. Rather than waiting, we just sat inside, a two-top table across from the bar.  We split a small pizza and both ordered some peach iced tea. Half the pizza was pepperoni with jalepenos, the other half with sliced meatballs, ricotta and mushrooms. It arrived nice and hot. I loved the thin crust, it was perfectly foldable. The ricotta cheese was very flavorful and complemented the meatballs quite well. I would say that the pepperoni side was just average though. The server came by once in awhile to check on us and filled up our drinks.  What I liked best about this place was the noise level. Too often I go to a pizza place and I can hardly hear what anyone is saying. Here, we're sitting next to the bar (who had the TV on) and there were a steady stream of customers in the restaurant. Yet, we could still hear each other talk.  My dining companion wanted to get some dessert, their cheesecakes, after the pizza, however upon finishing the pizza the server came over and just plopped down the check. Did not even ask if we wanted dessert.  Overall, I would say that this is a nice place for a lunch meeting or date. Don't expect anything too fancy."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza only New York style but very flavorful atmosphere nice. Sangria was good great atmosphere to watch the game as well. Nice high end pizzeria will definitely come back when on vacation."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is due to their prices. I love their pizza and gladly pay what they ask for it but I believe it's a little overpriced for PIZZA! I do LOVE this place though. Reminds me of the pizza I grew up eating back home on the east coast. Perfectly controlled portions of crust, sauce, meat, basil, garlic and whatever else. Absolutly in my top 5 pizza spots in the country, at least that I've had so far. I also really like their flavors of cheesecake especially their seasonal and specialty cheesecakes. YUMMM!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza. It's nice that it's also open later than most places.   We ordered a margherita pizza and added sausage. The pizza crust was crispy and flaky. The toppings of basil and sausage was great. I only wish that they put more cheese.   The service we received was great as well. The host opened the door as we were walking up to the main doors and greeted us. The waitress was very friendly and chatted with us for a little bit while we waited for the pizza."}
{"text":"We drove 38 miles to meet our friends for dinner. They recommended this pizza restaurant. We ordered the House Salad without red peppers and onions. And we each ordered a personal pizza. The idea behind the way you order pizza is pretty smart for the business but not for your wallet. I ordered the pizza with the red sauce, Italian sausage, mushrooms and anchovies. The large house salad had the oil and vinegar dressing. It was just the right amount for four people. The pizza was tasty, but for $16, I thought it was a bit pricey. We split the bill which came to $60 per couple. The wives had a glass of wine and us guys had lemonade, four personal pizzas, 1 coffee and their peanut butter cup cheesecake, But HEY...we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Disappointed. We've been here before and it was fine. Today the pizza was wayyyy undercooked. It was like eating sauce and cheese on dough. Had to wait quite awhile for another. The waiter came over thinking we already got our new pizza. Nope. Still waiting. About 15 minutes later we had a pizza finally. And it was cooked!!  Pretty good but they still charged us full price for everything. Not worth it after the experience today. Maybe consider treating customers a little better???  Saying sorry for the wait?  Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza spot right in the Grand Canal Shops area.  Very little wait to sit for a party of 12.  They put a few tables together quickly and had the tables set up in no time!  Our waiter was cool, he was patient with us because we all couldn't decide what we wanted but he helped us along the way and maintained attentiveness.  We ordered 4 16\" pies and about 4 salads.  Everyone shared and it was definitely enough for us all.  The crust was light and crispy and tomato sauce nicely seasoned.  I always wondered about the ratio of how much tomato sauce to use on the crust.  Well, I'm not sure, but they had it down packed.  I had an all white pizza (my hubby ordered it) and a chicken, artichoke, and cheese one.  I loved how fresh the pizza were and loved the light crust!"}
{"text":"This place should have got a five and I wanted to give it one, but the service was not very good. Waiter was friendly, but it took about 20 minutes for drinks from the bar and even longer for food. If not for that the atmosphere and food was awesome! Great spot in the market place area too."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza in town! The cheese is amazing, and the pepperoni they use is fantastic!   The only reason I'd not rate then five stars is because the service is lackluster. I've never had particularly good service. It always seems to take long time to get our order in, or refills on drinks. It'd be something I could look past a little more, but it's a tad on the pricey side... The pizza is worth the price, but not the service."}
{"text":"I sure enjoyed my lunch at Grimaldi's yesterday! The pizza is so unique and my Greek salad was amazing. My server was the perfect amount of help without being intrusive. I tried the special and I would never experienced it without his encouragement. The make your own pizzas were my friend's choices and they each were delicious."}
{"text":"I love this pizza joint . Their pizza definitely has an east coast twist to it with the oven clay fire taste. The environment is clean, cute, and warm with nice brick decor. Our waitress was average but order was accurate. I definitely recommend trying their pizza if you are a pizza lover . A medium is plenty for 2."}
{"text":"This location is a disappointment time and time again.   In the three times I've visited in the past three months, each time my order has been incorrect - even after having the person taking my order repeat it back. In addition, i arrive within the suggested window (20 minutes) and my Pizza is dried out every time! I'm not sure why a thin crust place has a warmer - it's messing up the crust!   I would not recommend this location.   Three stars bc the pizza was edible, though I did not have more than one slice."}
{"text":"As this is one of my favorite meals in New York every time I visit, when I saw this on this side of the country (and just discovered another one opening in El Segundo later this year!!), I HAD to go. The waitress said that everything is the exact same as the one in Brooklyn, even down to the water they use for the dough.  So you customize your own pizza and can make it a personal size or share with others. For 2 ppl, the large (18\" for $16 + $2-4 per topping) is a pretty good size that gives you 6-8 slices. All I can say is GET THE RICOTTA CHEESE. Seriously.  The waitress also highly recommended the new amaretto cheesecake as well... good luck trying to save stomach room for that!  Thus my review of the original Brooklyn location holds the same for this location (except for the 45 min wait since this location is much bigger): http://www.yelp.com/biz/grimaldis-brooklyn#hrid:Q_ExojPX-KbgJvNS1Bnujw  1 Front St Brooklyn, NY 11201 (718) 858-4300  11/28/2009  \"The best New York pizza I've ever had! Being a California girl, I've still managed to make my way to Grimaldi's twice this year and even waited in the 45 minute long line to get into the door. The wait was definitely worth the fresh, doughy, thin crusted pizza with an array of toppings to delight your taste buds. I think the first time I went, we ordered mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, and ricotta on our pizza. The second time we ordered basil, sun dried tomatoes, and sausage. Both times the pizza wasn't too oily or too cheesy, and the chewy sun dried tomatoes gave the texture an extra kick. And despite my friends and I eating the entire large pizza, we still walked out without the bloated, heavy feeling. Excellent.\""}
{"text":"Service - second time at this location and the service was slow once again. As soon as we arrived they sat us immediately, but it took about 5-10 minutes before anyone could attend to us. We were looking around waiting for service when several employees passed by us without even acknowledging us. Clearly, we needed help. When our server finally approached us, he didn't even tell us his name (found out his name was Jeff, after looking at the check). Our salad came out quickly, but I was the only one at the table without silverware. It seemed that everything that we asked for took awhile. They didn't bring our drinks right away. I was halfway through my plate of salad when our drinks finally came out. Our whole table was done eating and our server didn't even come by to check on us. Had to wait longer for our check and our change. It wasn't even busy at all. If anything, the restaurant was already clearing out by this time. When we left, NONE of the employees bothered to greet us thank you or goodbye. Instead, I saw the employees chatting with each other.   Food - the food is great, but they should work on quicker and friendlier service. Oh and the tables are a little crammed."}
{"text":"Wow! This place has really great pizza, some of the best I have ever had honestly! I'm really excited that I found a great place in the area to get real New York style pizza. My grandfather from New York owned a pizza shop for years and taught me what real NY pizza is, and this is definitely it. I wish I could have taken him here, he would have loved it. We just had the cheese pizza, and it was absolutely delicious. Their peanut butter chocolate cheesecake is insane as well. So great. Thank you Grimaldi's, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty tasty. Seems more to be on the healthier side. A little pricey, but not too bad. Our waitress was very polite and we enjoyed her recommendations. Solid place for pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is one of my two favorite local pizza places. The service is always good and we've never had a problem getting a table despite being a busy place. The wait for food is never too long. This isn't something that applies to me at this point, but the restaurant is family friendly.  They are a little different than most pizza places because they don't have any suggested pizza combinations. All of the pizzas are create your own. You choose the size, base (red sauce, pesto, or garlic), and then the toppings. Each topping is an additional charge so this may not be the best place for someone that likes many toppings. I like the red sauce because it has a unique flavor that doesn't overpower the toppings. The standard amount of cheese is minimal which I like, but for someone that wants a really cheesy pizza you may want to choose extra cheese.   In addition to good pizza they also have some tasty salads like the spinach salad. The small is definitely enough for two people to share if you are also getting a pizza."}
{"text":"Great place to come for pizza, our favorite is coming and sitting at the bar. Quick service and get to enjoy the crowd. Tends to get very busy and the bar is a quick way to get seated. If you do yelp, you can also check in online and get on the wait list.   Sign up for the club and get a free pizza for your birthday! Great deal!"}
{"text":"They have some really good pizza here! We had the white pizza, which has some garlic and white sauce, really tasty. They don't have any garlic bread or French bread, which was a little disappointing. They also don't have happy hour, although some of their house wines are $4 a glass at all times.  Also, if you sign up for their birthday club you get a free large 1 topping ($18 value)!"}
{"text":"On our first day in Vegas, we arrived and we were starving! We have been to a Grimaldi's in Allen, TX a few times when we lived in McKinney so as soon as we saw one nearby we decided to head there. Just like the one in Allen! We started with the antipasto app which was delicious as always. The pizza (a personal for the two of us) with pepperoni was delightful too.  Nice thin, crispy crust, good tomato sauce, real non-processed mozzarella, yum!"}
{"text":"This is the best of the Grimaldi's chain by far. Doesn't say much considering I'd much prefer to go to Due Forni for the pizzas because of more exotic ingredients and toppings. I like simple a menu, but I would also like the restaurant to do all the thinking for me and tell me what they found to be the best pizzas. Otherwise, I'm a lamo and end up ordering pepperoni with cheese.  I'm not an executive chef, I didn't go to school for it, so a dining out experience can be missed out if you don't have an imagination like me.   The plus side is that the crust here is spectacular. We ordered a cheese-less pizza and the charcoal crust was delicious enough to carry the pizza.  The down side is that if you don't feel like eating pizza, then \"No food for you! Get out!\""}
{"text":"This branch must be the weakest branch from Grimaldi's. How do I know? I did Grimaldi's patented pizza pie test. So you should test it out for yourself and make the decision.   1. Hold your pizza pie up by the crust and it must lie perpendicular to you. The slice was slagging. Grade C- 2. Make sure the ingredients/ toppings remain on the pie. It started to droop off the dough within several seconds. Grade C-  3. When you bite into the pie, make sure there's a crunch. No crunch to be found. Grade D 4. With the bite, steam should be coming out of your mouth. Indeed it did A.   I'm sad to say, all the key components are there at Grimaldi Summerlin. I think it's all a matter of execution. Side note, the service is not the greatest from the host/bartender. We arrived to an empty dining area but the bartender and host simply chose to ignore us over their chit chat."}
{"text":"Great pizza with an excellent free birthday gift of a free pizza if you are in their email club. That was nice. Just had to pay for drinks and a salad for our meal yesterday!  Very nice-and their pizza is excellent!"}
{"text":"Great little outdoor courtyard to eat a good salad and pizza during the cool months."}
{"text":"Incredible New York Style pizza.  I have a preference for thin crust pizza and this was really good. I'm born and raised in Arizona so I am far from being a pizza aficionado, but this was really good. Had a taste of their seasonal blueberry cheesecake and thought it was also phenomenal."}
{"text":"Had a 20 mins wait time but was seated within 10 minutes. Then food was scrumptious and fresh. Service was awesome with our server checking and refilling our drinks quickly. Had a great time. Will go again. Their caesar salad is different than most places but it was really really good."}
{"text":"Nice little place with excellent pizza and a nice selection of draft beers.  We had the small cheese pizza and it was plenty for two.  Unbelievably good perfectly cooked crust, excellent sauce and just the right amount of cheese with a sprinkling of basil on top.  If you know good pizza...you'll know this is very, very good pizza!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and service.  Small pizza was huge, very filling for two.  Unique thin crust pizza with great toppings.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot. I love pizza! Great location too."}
{"text":"Always consistently fresh and good food. Servers are nice too."}
{"text":"The pizza is what always brings us back here. It is very good. The service is usually just alright, at best.   Tonight was one of the worst experiences we have had here. Our server was awful, and it began from the start. We asked for the dough for our daughter to play with, and for a carafe of wine, neither of which we received until asking about 3 times for them. We asked her to box the last couple of slices we had, and started to worry after about 10 mins of time passing and still not having the box. We asked her for it a few times, and finally she had to bring the manager over to tell us they had to make us another pizza because she didn't know what happened to ours. We didn't need a whole other pizza, just wanted to stop being lied to about what was going on (her response the couple times we asked was \"oh yeah, I'll be right back with the box\"). After speaking with the manager and her at the same time, she walked away from our table saying \"wow\" like it was our fault her service was terrible. She became much more \"friendly\" once she dropped off our check and ran the card. Funny how that works.   I do want to say that it was very nice for the manager to have another pizza made for us, and even took care of the dessert we ordered. We didn't expect or ask for any of it, but we did really appreciate that he was concerned about our experience."}
{"text":"Get here early or there will be a wait, outside, in the scorching Arizona heat. I really have to be honest and say this was not my favorite tasting pizza, to me the sauce was lacking flavor. But watch out when you order the \"small\" pizza, it is about the size of a car tire.  They gave our 1 year old some pizza dough to play with which I thought was the coolest idea I had ever seen for entertaining little kids.  The servers are experienced top notch professionals."}
{"text":"I was driving to Henderson to get Grimaldi's and now there is one on this side of town. Henderson is apparently another state to people in Las Vegas, it is unfathomable that one would ever go that far away for anything.  Well Grimaldi's is so good it was worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The best pizza In the west valley! Our family loves it here and our kids beg for Grimaldis all the time! Delicious Calzones, the best pizza .. And great friendly staff! Only shame is no location in surprise ;)"}
{"text":"I would recommend caprese salad, white garlic, meat balls & sausage pizza. Pizza oven closes between 4-5pm."}
{"text":"water shipped from back east makes this a crust worth the wait. order a big salad to share and have a \"tasty beverage\" ...or two! while you wait for it.  I don't care that this one's a chain. It's probably due to my very low standards for pizza in general. now, for sure, i'm not going to wait 5 hours at bianco's, and the 19 hour trip to naples isn't happening this week either, but goddam this is good pizza.  start with a nice big mediterranean or caesar salad to share, cover it with loosely and fresh ground pepper to get your cough going, and pick up a blue moon or peroni while you wait for the goods...  whether you like red with pepperoni (my favorite), or the white with garlic, pesto and veggies, it's just about the best you can get, and it's just consistent, through and through. meet that with ol' blue eyes serenading you under those cool and characteristic overhead lighting and paneling, you can't go wrong.  --love the lightness of the pizza overall. sample lots of different ones from your group! --awesome for your office staff lunch. just call ahead to reserve their back room. MMmmm! pizza to share all around, with pitchers of tasty beverages following. PASS THE PEPPERS AND PARMESAN! nice! --host/hostess even opens the door as you arrive! service! --consistent and very professional service standard. friendly, excited and helpful staff all around. never had a problem, and i'm one snarky bastard!  # pass on the sangria. even at half-off during happy hour, it's too juicy for my Manhattan-loving (read:burned-off-taste-buds) palatte.  # they do have a tendency to cram your party into a table smaller than is comfortable. just express your discomfort and get a new table. done! # as mentioned in other reviews, this location has burned some pizzas for me, but it is rare. SEND IT BACK...they're happy to make it again if not to your liking."}
{"text":"Never coming back. Came here one day when we were roaming around the mall and they told us they didn't serve pizza until 5pm, but that they'd write our names down and to come back in 40 mins. We did. They acted like they had never seen us before and said \"oh we can take your name down, it's a 30 minute wait.\"   No, no thanks. I've had better pizza and service..."}
{"text":"I was surprised there were so few reviews for this location.  I have to admit that I traveled from LA just to try this pizza and it was worth it.  The quality of the pizza was great and the price wasn't bad either.  I tried the cannoli for dessert and it was addicting.  I will definitely put this on my to do list for my next Vegas trip.  The only reason I deducted one star was for the service.  It was just OK.  There was no one else there because we were there so late and the bartender kept cleaning his glasses instead of refilling ours.  He came around eventually, but just took a little too long considering we were the only ones  at the place.  I think next time we'll get the pizza to go and eat it in the hotel.  Side note: we also tried Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan and I enjoyed the atmosphere there, but I still think that Grimaldi's pizza is a better tasting and better quality pizza."}
{"text":"I want pizza. No, none of that gross delivery junk. REAL pizza.  Here is where you come for some of that fabled real pizza with great customer service. I recently had a dinner here with a close friend and we split a white pizza with italian sausage, ricotta, and spinach which was incredible. Our server took great care of us and was never intruding and didn't rush us out. This would be a great spot for a date!"}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it. My favorite regular crust pizza in the Valley. I love the woodfire taste, ricotta cheese sundried tomatoe combo.   The lights in this Grimaldis are awesome - all wine bottles hanging from the ceiling.   Price is a bit much for regular take out - but when I am in the mood for a wood fired pizza, this is my go to in the valley"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good although I got 1/2 jalapeño, and it was pickled jalapeño out of a jar.  Not fresh. Service average.  Atmosphere was nice. But, be warned of the tricky pricing. Each extra topping is $2-$4 whether it's on 1/2 the pizza or the entire pizza.  A pizza with 1/2 pepperoni and mushroom, and 1/2 sausage and onion is a 4 topping pizza.  We thought the bill had a mistake and when we inquired about it, the waitress was well rehearsed in her answer.  Must get asked frequently.  And she pointed out \"it says so right in the menu.\" Too many pizza choices in Phx to eat at a place with some canned ingredients and a bit of an extra ingredient scam going. Save money and grab a Dominos."}
{"text":"Very excellent customer service from ANA staff are very friendly and polite . Pizza was good but the next day had an upset stomach."}
{"text":"The Price is good portions are great for sharing. I liked the idea of the pizza cooking style and it tasted good but I enjoy more flavor like garlic and Italian session.  The house salad was really good the only thing I wish it had was cheese.  I held a after graduation dinner here everyone but my husband and were in love with the pizza We both just wanted more flavor ."}
{"text":"Was watching football & decided a pizza was in order, checked yelp & it lead us here in the Palazzo.  It was a great experience over all just not the best pizza I have had but very good."}
{"text":"My first slice of pizza in NYC was at the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. I was never really a pizza person before (don't judge too hard please - having grown up in LA, all the pizza was kinda subpar), but one bite of Grimaldi's had me spiraling down a pizza rabbit-hole of obsession. I was HOOKED and I had Grimaldi's to thank. Since my first pie at Grimaldi's many many years ago, I've taken all my friends who visited NY to Grimaldi's for that quintessential NYC pizza heaven.   And I was super stoked to find the Grimaldi's in Las Vegas. The hype and expectation were so real and so high - and I'm so happy to report that Grimaldi's in LV did not disappoint.   Crust = perfect achievement of thin and substantive. And supposedly the Grimaldi's kitchen takes its dough so seriously that it hires chemists to replicate the water pH and chemical balance of NYC so that the same water is used in their dough everywhere!  Sauce = ugh. so goooooooooood. Sweet and savory, without being overly empowering of either.   CHEESE = fresh. SO FRESH and that mozzarella was so melt-in-your-mouth that I'm still singing about it!  Between the two of us, the personal pizza (12'') was plenty! Plus we got a little greedy and ordered the Caprese Salad as an appetizer.   **DO NOT GET THE CAPRESE SALAD - the tomatoes tasted old and bland. The cheese was good, but the tomatoes were such a letdown, and I'm just relieved that the tomatoes in the pizza were bursting with flavor.   GET THE PIZZA. Forget the other stuff on the menu. The pizza is where the taste & the money's at!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, and I have to say that the pizza was amazing! I'm definitely coming back before I leave to Oahu"}
{"text":"Love this location. Staff is friendly and service never disappoints. Sat at the bar on a busy Friday night had attentive service and food was phenomenal as usual."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Chicago deep dish pizza over the years. Even been to the original Uno in Chicago so have at least SOME street cred imho. Was in Las Vegas for business and wanted to get some of nature's perfect food. Came across Grimaldi's and gave it a try. Wasn't expecting much given its Vegas and I had the WORST FISH AND CHIPS EVER that afternoon. Having assumed mediocrity I was pleasantly surprised and have to admit it might be the BEST pizza I've EVER had with outstanding service in the bar area (at ground level). Nicely done! So be warned.....Once I take my (as yet undetermined) future conceptual company public and make zillions of $$ I will be buying this outfit for my own personal gastronomical  gratification."}
{"text":"Me and my wife from Kentucky happened upon this location while exploring this side of Vegas. As soon as we entered, we were greeted in a most friendly way. The manager {David} and the door host greeted us with a huge smile and a warm welcome. Pizza is one of our favorites and we have sampled many around the USA over the years. I must admit, there was not slice left in the pan! The pizza was thin tossed with a crispy crunch. Nicely burnt edges.  Cheesy and loaded with tiny pepperoni's!  We were very pleased and our bellies were full when we left for our hotel. A great deal for the price, great service and atmosphere! We will be back when we visit Grimaldi's in Vegas again! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza you will ever experience in Las Vegas. Two locations on the strip, but this is my favorite spot. Hot fresh made to order brick oven thin crust pizza with fresh mozzarella and all the topping that you want. You will not be disappointed! A must stop while in Vegas"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's where have you been all our life?  Great thin crust pizza.  We ate here twice while in vegas, great service and even better pizza!"}
{"text":"small pizza was like a medium at other places. it was divided into 6 slices evenly.   the pizza crust was delicious - thin and lightly burnt - just the way i like it!!   got the pepperoni and mushroom toppings - i like the pepperoni, it was different and tasted really good.   the pizza had the perfect amount of sauce, service was good. I like the atmosphere of there restaurant and that you can see two pizza guys tossing the pizza dough - that was amusing to watch.  next time, i'll ask for extra basil!"}
{"text":"I'm not a New Yorker, i have never had NYC style pizza.  I have a Brooklyn born Doctor friend who tells me that there isn't such a thing as New York style Pizza, it's just the ONLY Pizza....so New Yorkers don't hate because i'm ignorant on true NY pizza.  Started the night with Antipasto...waitress reminded me that it doesn't come with lettuce....funniest thing ever heard, but then again not many people grow up in an area with such a large italian population like Chicago.  Alright the pizza was good, the dough was tastey (would order a little extra done to get it like some of the Naples pizza i've had) perfect salt and consistancy.  Sauce...what sauce, it was lost in the bake, so i would order x-tra sauce.  We ordered a 16\" Roasted Red Pepper and Onion...again sauce was absent, peppers were really good quality and onions were nice a carmelized from the heat, mozzarella was perfect amount and quality....HOWEVER, it missed something, asked for a 50 cent cup of chopped basil and added it on with some olive oil and parmigiano and voila!  it took an okay pizza and made it FANTASTIC.  I grew up on pizza from Chicago, i'm talking thin crust party pizza not deep dish (since most people assume Chicago = DD, and i'm not a huge fan of DD) and had pizza from Ragusa to Milano in italy and I make my own pizzas form scratch.  This pizza was good, worth going and will do it again....am i blown away?  Not terribly...did like that the ingredients were as fresh as possible...Basil i ordered tasted like i picked it from my garden.  So i give it a 3.5 because it won't ever leave me with ever having a craving for it....just if i'm in the neighborhood and feel like pizza i'll stop in, but i won't jump in my car during a monsoon to go get some."}
{"text":"I am not really a pizza fan, or really of Italian food in general.  However, my bf is part Italian and from the East Coast, so sometimes his tastes win.   For some reason, tonight I wanted to try Grimaldi's (mostly because I read on here their cheesecake was really good, and I wanted cheesecake!) so we braved the horrible parking lot and went in.  It was a Friday night, and for some reason the Hooters next door is always slammed, leaving no parking spots.  I am glad I dragged my bf out of the house, because we were so impressed!  The decor was nice, and gave lots of historic NYC pictures to look at while eating, and I loved the wine glass chandeliers.  But the food was the star tonight. It could have been a hovel, and I still would have given it 5 stars. We started with a small ceasar salad to share, and I almost ate the fork trying to eat it as fast as I could. The dressing we was perfect for me.   I wanted a white pizza with artichokes and chicken, but the bf wanted sausage - only sausage.  But I added mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes, just because I could.  I am glad I did!  The sun-dried tomatoes were sweet, and the sausage a bit salty and spicy and the mushrooms were full of flavor. Each bite was full of different flavors, which I loved and part of why I normally dislike pizza - as it's normally all just one flavor.    As for the crust - I actually ate it!  I don't eat crust on bread, pizza, most pies...etc - and I still ate this crust.  It was that good! When it came to dessert, even though they had cannoli's, I knew I was getting cheesecake.  I was thinking about Strawberry cheesecake all night, but our waiter said to get the Oreo cheesecake.  I took his recommendation, holding him responsible if it sucked.  He was right!  It was great!  My boyfriend got the cannoli, and while it was great - we agreed my cheesecake was better! I feel stupid I never knew there were two other locations, and I could have discovered this earlier!"}
{"text":"Always love the pizza and the salad combo...plus NEW YORK CITY representing!! Cant go wrong when NYC is in LV..."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend in Phoenix and after researching pizza places on yelp we found this place. We really enjoyed the ambience. I love the music that they were playing in the background and the lighting in the restaurant was awesome. Now, let's get to the pizza. OMG!!!!! Completely delicious! We all loved the thin crust. It was so fresh too! We had side salads which we really should not have gotten because we were kind of full by the time we got to the pizza. But overall I highly recommend trying this place and if I'm ever back in Phoenix I will definitely go here again"}
{"text":"I've been here two or three times ever since moving to AZ. It's a great place to take your family since the pizzas are huge! Always very good quality food and customer service."}
{"text":"Lived in Brooklyn for 3 years and loved Grimaldi's -- this location is just as good as the real thing."}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza. Incredible service. Ask for Rachel. Works hard. Great suggestions for food and wine. Very personable. Loves her job. Food was hot. Fresh. Delicious. Come here every spring training. Don't fret over the wait. Have a fresh beer or glass of wine while you wait, the food is worth."}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza joint!! Our go to pizza is the pepperoni and sausage with pesto and red sauce."}
{"text":"MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PIZZA. Hands down. I am not much of a marinara fan so I LOOOOOOOOVE the White Pizza w/ Pepperoni! MM MMMM MMMMM We live right next to San Tan so we come to this one frequently and also do take out. I have been to the one's in Scottsdale and Ocotillo also and they are just as delish. On a weekend night there will be probably about a 30 minute wait so get ready for it. But they are always very nice and welcoming. I LOVE this pizza. I cant say it enough. I have never had a better pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and even better staff. Ate here twice last week it was so good. Pizzas are incredible.    I will definitely be going back on the next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"There are many choices in the Las Vegas area to eat and celebrate special occasions. My sons graduation party today , felt like we were home. Great food, service.. thanks so much for giving my sailor a great bon voyage!! See you again soon..."}
{"text":"Coal oven pizza? Not sure if I was environmentally friendly tonight but at least I had a good meal!  Weather permitting, dine outside on the patio. It's new construction so there's room to add a bit more character but as-is with the beautiful towering trees and rows of lights overhead, the patio is a pleasant retreat.   The pizza is delicious. Fresh vegetables, crisp crust and well-seasoned sauce. They offer a decent wine selection as well as a refreshing passion fruit ice tea.   Service is friendly and the atmosphere is casual.   Save room for dessert because Sugar Bowl is across the street."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with co-worker who has eaten here before. This was my first visit. Located in a new upscale part of Scottsdale close to the airport. It's all about the pizza. They have a limited menu of non pizza Italian selections and quite a nice wine list. I had a marguerita pizza. Loved it. The crust was perfect. Obviously the owners are from New York. Decor is all New York, and they pipe Frank Sinatra music all day. Check it out."}
{"text":"Although I have only eaten at Patsy Grimaldi's one time and it was good, my review is about the bartender and their overall service.  I came in to the restaurant on Saturday afternoon after spending most of the day at the Culinary Festival.  For some reason, we had a craving for pizza after eating a slice from Spinatti's at the festival.  Seemed like a good idea at the time.  When we came in to Grimaldi's, we were informed of a 20 minute wait for a table and instead decided to grab the four available seats at the bar.  We were in a good mood and definately had a few drinks during the festival and were enjoying the time with some friends.  The bartender seemed to be in a sour mood (maybe from people before us) and immediately said \"I am not serving you any drinks\" before we even asked for anything.  He then proceeded to accuse us of being obnoxious and loud and walked away without even asking for our order.  I found this one of the worst experiences of my entire life in a restaurant and will never step foot into Grimaldi's again.  We filed a complaint with the manager and went on our way to Malee's where they were happy to serve us food and drinks and had a much better time.  Patsy Grimaldi's should do a much better job in training their staff in courtesy and customer service."}
{"text":"I have been eating pizza for a fairly long time. I make my own pizza dough and use fresh toppings. So what I am saying is, I know food. You didn't want a review from a pizza hut expert, did you? Anyway, I have had two pizzas from here (same vacation!) and they were both excellent.  The Brooklyn Bridge is an awesome pizza. I never thought of putting ricotta on a pizza before. Also almost nobody make a proper caprese salad any more. It was served to me, the proper way. No dried oregano, no balsamic drizzle, just cheese, tomato and fresh basil leaf.  If you haven't tried pizza here, don't be discouraged that it is a \"chain\", you'd just be doing yourself a disservice."}
{"text":"I'm the daughter of a coal miner, I felt obligated to check this place out. The wait was long (45 mins) and the bar was a little slow when we wanted drinks to keep us held over until we got seated.. But one we got food, the pizza was impressive. Good crust, not too greasy cheese (though I did wish there was more), and our food server was very friendly and attentive. If you're sick of delivery pizza and are looking for a unique pizza place, go here. You get to see the pizza being made behind the counters and as expected, the place smalls amazing. This isn't a fast in and out place to eat, so don't come in a hurry if you want to make a movie that starts in a half hour - it's the sort of place where you don't mind hanging out for bit.  I should note - I actually found a piece of coal in my pizza.. It was pretty identifiable, but a little bit of a surprise. Apparently it's a normal thing from the cooking process.. Just keep an eye out."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is casual with a laid back vibe and great music. Take your friends for a good time!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend  this place to everyone !! The pizza was Amazing !!  The customer service  the salad  really nice people. The manager had given us a free pizza on top of the pizza we already had ( we took it home ) because our pizza had a couple of holes in it  ( parts of the dough had holes in it )  the place was beautiful inside and overall exceptional service !! Thank you !!"}
{"text":"I got to say this is a great go-to spot for pizza! I absolutely love the food and service here. First off for the kids, instead of giving those papers and crayons, they get pizza dough to stretch and play with. I don't remember if they gave a kids menu, but I believe they don't have any kids menus. Now, the pizza. The pizza were absolutely amazing with a nice crisp to it. Also, you have to try the calzones! I just love the New York theme to the restaurant. I have to mention the service too! All the people there seem very nice and attentive. If your ever staying at the Suncoast hotel or just have extra time and craving some pizza, come check out this spot!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza on my side of town! The place is so clean and the pizza is so bomb broskiiiii!! Amazing staff as well."}
{"text":"Love when i get to try something in Vegas that's off the strip.   Local Friends took us to have lunch here on our last visit.  Great choice, pizza was perfect!!!  Definitely returning when i'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Wow! What delicious, cheesy, flavorful pizza. I kept hearing about Grimaldi's and finally had to give it a try.   Build your own pizza is always the best way to go. Pick your favorite toppings to make what is to you the perfect pizza. Go on Tuesdays, wine is half off. You may not think pizza and wine go together but if you are a wine lover like I am, a white wine pairs perfectly. I wouldn't even mind red.  It's a breath of fresh air to have high expectations of a restaurant and not be disappointed. Pizza is definitely on point here and I'm very picky with my pizzas! I've been back a few times to the other locations (there's one on Eastern and another on Rainbow) and hope to be back again soon."}
{"text":"We went to this location after visiting the other one on the Strip and this one just wasn't as nice or friendly. There was a long wait and it was very crowded. The pizza was still excellent, but the vibe wasn't as nice. It was noisy and the service was lackluster. It was a hassle to use a coupon we had here too.   If you're craving NY pizza, this isn't a bad option (as the pizza is still fantastic), but do check out the newer location (that's not in a mall). It has more intimacy and atmosphere. The staff was friendlier and it had a cooler vibe. This one definitely feels like you're in a mall and you can see the mall traffic walking by.   Sign up for their email club, and you get a free pizza on your birthday!"}
{"text":"There's two locations on the Strip in Vegas; this one is much more intimate. We were there in August 2012 and that time, it had only been opened a few weeks. It was quiet and the staff was incredibly attentive. We took a seat out front which was nice and had a view of the bar.  Their pizzas are absolutely amazing. They make sure to make them as close to the original in Brooklyn as possible. They built the same type of oven and even ship in NYC water for authenticity. Duly noticed! I haven't been to the Brooklyn version, but this was fantastic and the best I may have ever had outside of NY.   Also, sign up for their email club, they'll give you a free pizza on your birthday! I got mine because I was in Vegas for mine! So awesome!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Met a family member who was in town on a recent Saturday night at Patsy Grimaldi's.  I had been excited about trying this place for quite awhile, and had heard many good things.  Too make a long story short...it was ok.  I won't be rushing back anytime...  There were seven of us, and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes for a table at 530.  Once we were seated the service was okay, definitely not fast, but not really slow.  The wife and I split a caesar salad and a basil/garlic pizza.  The caesar got poor reviews from both of us.  The pizza was just ok.  It did get better as I ate more, but it wasn't super, nor was it horrible.  Maybe slightly better than average.    Another drawback is that it was quite loud.  We were probably 75% of the way through the meal before I was able to identify that they were playing music in the restaurant, and that the music was Christmas Carols.  They did seem to have the ability to accommodate large parties, so that is nice, and they were showing a couple football games in the bar.  I guess I'd go back, but there are plenty other pizza places I like better or would like to try."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza. We happily returned to Grimaldis and enjoyed their delicious oven fired pizza, just love the crust!  We each ordered our favorite. Mgr Mike has super customer service skills  and makes sure his customers are satisfied.   A minor glitch was not getting our salad. When I tried to order the house salad, the server told me that Grimaldis had NO house salad.  Luckily I came up with the correct name which was Grimaldis garden salad, I think... after all that, the server forgot to order it!  Wed at 6 pm was a busy time at Grimaldis. We'll arrive earlier next time to avoid the crowd. Love Grimaldi's wonderful pizza and will be back another time!"}
{"text":"Ordered this to be delivered, it was right up there as one of the worst Pizza's I have ever eaten. There was no crust, which can be a good thin but this crust was like it wasn't baked. The toppings were swimming and I mean swimming in sauce on the top and the cheese was under the sauce and toppings. It looked like an Italian pasta dish without the pasta. Tried it the next day and had to take a spatula to scrape it out of the box, it had adhered to the cardboard, but thought Oh well if I heated it up maybe it would be better as a left over. Wrong. It really was worse. No thanks, Domino's would have been much better and saved me alot of bucks"}
{"text":"I came to this Grimaldi's for a lunch meeting with a client. She picked the place and I delivered my manager so the meal would be free-99.   I have eaten at Grimaldi's in the past at Boca Park and I really, really enjoyed it. There were a few kinks to my experience at this one on Rainbow that has me kind of weary of trying it again.  When we first entered there was an odd smell to the air, kind of like there might be an open sewer line somewhere, but also a possibility of leakage somewhere in the restaurant due to recent rains. Either way - no good.  We were escorted to our table and ordered waters with lemon and the Caprese Salad to start. Tomatoes were incredibly fresh and meaty, paired with big chunks of mozz and fragrant basil. Drizzled with olive oil, this was a nice starter.  Our pizza: We ordered the white pizza, with extra cheese, spicy sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Maybe this is where we went wrong -- to me the combo was a bit too much.   The crust was thin and crispy, but really chewy, more chewy than I would like. Hard to pull away from with just your teeth and/or hands, and hard to cut with a fork and knife. I was grinding my knife down into it and making those scratchy sounds against my plate.  The place is cute, but I thought the wall decor was kind of tacky, it also is very vacant-looking so there isn't a really nice \"homey\" feel to it you might expect at a pizza joint.  Overall - this place is far from where I live, so I would not go out of my way to come here. I am not saying I will never have Grimaldi's again, but this experience was only okay."}
{"text":"Mama mia...   I like pizza, I eat a lot of it. Am I the only one? Didn't think so.   Stopped by this Grimaldi's right around lunch time after my friends and I had tuckered ourselves out shopping for Christmas goodies around Boca Park. We were very hungry with visions of pizzas dancing in our heads as wen entered the rustic-looking establishment. It is not huge, nor is it small. The wooden tables and wooden decor all around make a nice, cozy feeling. I caught a glimpse of the lighting above, which are wine bottle hung from the ceiling - loved it!  As for the menu, it's straight up simple here so don't come looking for anything other than pizza, salad, or a calzone. There were no appetizers on the menu, to which I was slightly disappointed. This may be different at dinner, but I can't be sure.  Everything here is pretty much build your own pizza, which I think is pretty cool. We started with the white garlic pizza (large), added grilled chicken, fresh Roma tomatoes, fresh basil, and for a nice spicy kick - jalapenos. Often times I think fresh tomatoes on pizzas make them soggy and gross, but luckily this one did not.  The pizza came out relatively fast; it is a nice, crispy, thin pizza, with a bubbly, brown, crunchy crust. I am not a pizza-connoisseur so I am not sure what \"style\" this may be, but I enjoyed it. I think we got just the right amount of toppings, anymore and the poor pizza would not have withheld them.  My suggestions: come if you want PIZZA, straight up, nothing else. Build your own and experiment with toppings. BUT - do not go crazy, I'd say, 3 *maybe* 4 toppings at the most and make sure you're putting stuff on there that makes sense.  Overall I was pleased, between the three of us we got an amazing pizza, plenty of toppings, and splitting the bill we each owed UNDER $10. Yes. That's a damn good deal. Of course, remember, there were three of us splitting a large, so prices may vary! I will definitely come back here to try some more styles and toppings."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great pizza and don't want to spend $15-$20 for an individual pie for one, this is the place for you.  We ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza. It had eight large slices.  It had the perfect crust and it tasted awesome.  Pizza oven looks identical to the one they have in Brooklyn and tons more seating so you don't have to wait in long lines like in Brooklyn.  Great find at the Canal Shoppes."}
{"text":"I only came here because I tried the original Grimaldi's location in Brooklyn, NY. (see review)  Since I cannot afford to fly to NY at a whim, Vegas is a little closer to home. Although, Grimaldi's isn't exactly in Vegas but it is worth the drive when visiting.  The biggest advantage to visiting the Vegas location versus Brooklyn is space.  This restaurant is much larger and therefore, no wait time.  The downside is slow service once seated.  You also do not have that 'authentic' down-home feel like the Grimaldi's in BK.  The ambiance is like any other pizza joint, nothing special and nothing unique.  There's nothing like the original but the white pie here was still pretty damn good.  Don't forget to add sun-dried tomatoes.  And if you have room left, try the cannoli.   Some people like fast food for the 'cheap' deals so if you prefer to stick to the dollar menus or have Domino's just to save a few bucks then keep it moving.  Grimaldi's isn't your cheap or even average-priced pizza.  It is worth the extra $ so treat yourself sometime!  4 STARS for this location 5 STARS for the original location - must try but beware of the long line!"}
{"text":"Was at the mall doing some browsing and stumbled across this place.. I live some good pizza and being from out of town sometimes it's hard.. let's just say I was not disappointed. . Got a large pepperoni and mushroom to share between me and a buddy and let's just say nothing was left and we were eyeballing the other pizza on the table. I love Brick oven pizza and fresh mozzarella yummmmmy.. will definitely stop by on my next trip to LV"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. In short. Ok so let's expand on this, anyone who knows grimaldis knows that it is yummy however if you love food then you understand that eating out is more than just food. The ambiance, drinks and location also add to the delicious experience. We sat at the bar and absolutely loved the bartender. Sadly a couple of days later his name slips my mind but he was the greatest. We were there on a Tuesday night for the Thew Tasting half off wines. Absolutely a great night to go. Enjoy the food, half off wine and great bartender."}
{"text":"I ordered a large Margarita pizza and picked it up. I only live 2 miles away from here. When I got home, the pizza was slightly warm. The ingredients were fresh but not many on the pizza itself, hardly any sauce, cheese or tomatoes. The crust was like a cracker, dry and when you bit into it, it broke apart. Weird. The place looks nice, although there were not many people in there. I know it has great reviews and maybe I just hit it wrong, or maybe had I eaten it there, it would have been better. Time to find a better pizzeria. In Las Vegas....that won't be difficult."}
{"text":"The antipasto salad was a perfect starter to share with the group as it also comes with slices of bread.  For the entree I ordered a regular (red sauce) personal pizza with Italian sausage and sun dried tomatoes and it was more than enough portion for a big eater like myself.  Pizza here is NY style so each bite was juicy with no drip and with just enough crust not trying your mouth out.  My friends had also ordered the white with garlic pizza which was good too and not dry at all which I had expected given there is no red sauce and is substituted with extra cheese.  Overall I liked the regular pizza better.  For dessert I ordered a slice of their homemade NY cheesecake and wow it was amazing.  You can tell it was homemade and fresh right away, no questions asked.  I think next time I'll ask for more raspberry sauce drizzle because it was just too good."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the pizza here.  Lovely, crispy coal oven, crust and good flavor.  We got simple pepperoni and cheese and it was good enough that between 2 of us we at a whole large in one sitting.  I should really be embarrassed but I'm not.  I also had a greek salad and the ingredients were fresh so I enjoyed it as well.  Our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"My husband is a total pizza snob and he loves this place! If he could eat here every week or more, he would. We've never had anything we didn't love. The staff are also super friendly and they care about serving the customer."}
{"text":"Vegetarian pizza was amazing! Kids had the meat lovers......excellent taste. Terrific service. Kids loved being kept busy with pizza dough."}
{"text":"Today pretty much everything was perfect.  Catherine was our server and she was incredibly friendly, attentive, personable.  When I asked for a lot of ice in my water, she gave me a lot of ice and refilled my water several times as I was super thirsty.  During our 15 minute wait to be seated, my son asked for water and they got him a nice ice filled glass of water while we waited, which was great.  The wait wasn't too long.  We got seated in the corner near the bar area and that helped cut down on the noise, but it was still loud in the restaurant.    We had a free pizza birthday coupon for a large 1 item topping that we got for free, but we added additional toppings and ordered a large antipasto plate, which we all totally love to get every time and gobbled it up quickly.  It consisted of roasted red pepper, mozzarella, basil, salami, bread, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and 2 types of olives.  My husband and daughter are the only ones that like the olives, but we love everything else.  We got a large bacon, olive, and pepperoni pizza (love the tiny pepperoni) and it's delicious as always.  After we got served our slices, we all like to put the flaked red pepper on our pizza.  I put some and then my husband started to shake the container over his slice as normal and the top came off pouring out the contents of all the red pepper.    We couldn't brush the pepper off and Catherine replaced that slice with a personal pizza instead.  We enjoyed our time there.  All the food came really fast, but not so fast we couldn't enjoy the food.  Catherine was excellent and probably the best server I've ever had at Grimaldi's.  We gave her a really nice tip and appreciated her great attitude."}
{"text":"Second trip in two days for this Amazing Brooklyn Pizza.   We highly recommend the pizza as it is Awesome!!!  The staff is super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Good pizza!  Hubs and I opted to get personal sizes so that we could each have what we wanted.  I loaded up my pizza with all kinds of goodies.  The biggest thing, I would say, is that you pay for every topping and this can get pricey.  We ended up paying almost $80 for 2 personal pizzas, 2 salads, 1 tea and 1 cocktail.  If it weren't for that, they would have earned an extra star."}
{"text":"This location should receive 5 stars for the food and none for the service.  So I compromised.  We arrived at 415pm on a Saturday and we were informed by the Host as he drank a soda with the straw in his mouth \"we are stoking, are you familiar with this\".  No, this was the first time we've been here.  Still with the straw in his mouth, \"we have to change the coals out and re-start the fire and this process takes about an hour\".  Ok, we will order an appetizer and wait.  He then said, it will be just a moment while we get your table ready.  I looked around and there were only 3 tables occupied.  About 15 minutes later, he directs us to a table right near where we were standing.  The server took our drink order and offered to go ahead and place the order so we were first in line when the oven was ready.  We ordered a couple appetizers and placed the order.  The small salad was enough for 3 people and the large antipata was enough for 5.  They were wonderful!  We ordered 2 large pizzas & a large calzone- All were excellent!  The meatball pizza was amazing!  The calzone was stuffed full and did not disappoint.  The price was a little high.  Not happy that you have to pay $4-$6 for each additional topping.  When we were ready to go, the server was nowhere in sight.  We finally waived down a Manager and he took our card.  Only then did the Server appear and drop off our bill and say, \"thank you so much for stopping in\".  Again, the food was fantastic, but the service was bad.  And why they would change the coals at dinner time on a Saturday, I'm not sure.  I would go back again.  But I would order ahead and make sure to avoid the \"stoking\" hours."}
{"text":"Service was good, we got greeted as soon as we walked in, they offered dough for our daughter to play with and, sat us down promtly.. Waitress came right over to take our drink orders, then came back with drinks and took our food order. Service was good, but the pizza came out a little extra crispy.. other than that it was very good and service was good."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my mom, our server was Ashley. And she is absolutely amazing. Pizza is always great, and the salad was so good!! Great for a lunch spot"}
{"text":"I can't say I found anything I disliked about the place. Maybe the prices, but that's probably just because I'm predominantly cheap lol. For a date night, however, it wasn't bad.   The food was fantastic. We got one of their specialty pizzas The Don (which is just a fancier name for meat lovers) and the server recommended wine pairing that went well with it. I stopped regretting not getting a beer by the end of the evening.   I'll be back. I love pizza (and hate my overall health, apparently). Good stuff!"}
{"text":"While visiting the Chandler area, I decided to check out Grimaldi's off Ray Road. Holy Cow! I ordered the Pesto Pizza with chicken and garlic (recommended by our fabulous waitress, Jess), and the White Sangria. The ambiance, the food, and the friendly service is enough to make me a repeat customer. Just two weeks later, I strolled in again with my date, and Jess remembered us from the first time. I like Grimaldi's because it's genuine. You DO get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I have always loved Grimaldis pizza. Their pepperoni is one of my favorites and my family really likes the white pizza with sausage and onions. Their crust tastes so good and is the right texture. Their Mediterranean salad was good, but kinda sour. Service was nice."}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's on Sunday.  Had a reservation for 1PM.  Best to call ahead and find out when the ovens are ready.  This is a great restaurant.  Wonderful service.  We ordered the large pizza with pepperoni, sausage, onions, peppers and mushrooms. We had the house salad and a glass of wine.  Everything was wonderful!  Cannot wait to go back there. Make a reservation because they were very busy yesterday!  The cheesecake was to die for."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Las Vegas I eat here at least once. This trip, I ate there twice. I like the ambience of the restaurant. It has a NYC state of mine atmosphere. Tonight, we were searching for another place to have dinner that was Italian. But ended back here again. And the music playing and the awesome pizza \"The Don\" just made it a very nice evening. The pizza's are really tastie. I love that they are thin. The staff is always very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever eaten.  Really wanted to eat there twice on my trip to Vegas but never made it back.  I visit Vegas twice a year and make it a point to eat here.  The service was excellent.  I probably won't waste my time on a salad again and just eat more pizza!  There was nothing wrong with it just that it was nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"You can have white sauce with garlic, pesto or traditional. We ordered the traditional 12\" pizza with spinach, mushroom, pepperoni and spicy chicken sausage. It was a perfect thin crust with the perfect crunchy. Every bite was filled with flavor. The spicy chicken sausage really stood out!  Customer service was alright. The time it took to pay could have been quicker. The ambiance was casual and extremely loud with everyone trying to talk over each other. Overall, we enjoyed our food and would definitely come back to try their special pizzas."}
{"text":"The pizza here is good; but I think the type of pizza that is served here doesn't taste as good as a take out order. I think it would be 5 star-worthy excellent as something you eat directly out of the oven at the restaurant. I guess this type of pizza doesn't hold its taste in a carry out box for a long time. Don't get me wrong, it's good; but I'm guessing it'll be a lot better if you eat it at the restaurant. Maybe it's because the crust is so thin, it doesn't maintain the heat (and presumably its taste) as long as some of the thicker type of pizzas."}
{"text":"Really good service. Good Pizza, fresh toppings!  We never have dessert but we were talked into it. Had the caramel apple cheese cake. It was really good and a big enough for both of us to share."}
{"text":"First off the pizza is pretty decent and our server was fine. The salad was good, but the bruschetta was nothing more than dry toast with toppings. That's it for the niceties. This will be the last time I ever set foot in this restaurant. We have had nothing but issues the last few times we have gone here and the only reason we go is our son's birthday and it's where he wants. No more. The issues all stem from extremely awful management IMO. We have gone twice,at 2 different times, to only be told after being sat that there are no pizzas available (oven restocking). Thought we timed it well the second time since it was a different time of day, thought wrong I guess. All with the most recent screw up, they forgot an ordered pizza, the third time in a row BTW, and behaved as if it was our doing they didn't cook it. Look I get it that mistakes happen but own up to it please. The manager handled the entire situation as if \"oh well we forgot your pizza and you'll just wait the extra time while the rest of your party finishes eating\". Yes she eventually comped it, as she should, but only after I commented. My favorite part, after the pizza finally arrives the manager comes by and asks \"how's the pizza\", you mean besides 30 minutes late and after everyone else is finished eating??"}
{"text":"7131 W. Ray Road Chandler, AZ 85226   We arrived at Grimaldi's at 6:00 and were seated immediately. It was the birthday of one of our party and he had a coupon for $20 off for his birthday.   Drinks were served in a timely manner. For soft drinks they serve Pepsi products. The also serve iced tea as well as passion fruit iced tea. Our birthday boy had a Green Apple Sangria ($8). I personally did not care for it, but he seemed to enjoy it.  Two of our party ordered salads. The small Caesar salad ($8) was nicely done, but the Caprese ($9) left items to be desired. The tomato would not be ripe for another week or two, and the balsamic vinegar was a cheap knockoff.  On to the pizza's. The birthday boy ordered an 18\" buffalo chicken pizza ($25). Testing a piece of the chicken, I found it to be dry and very vinegary. The buffalo sauce was there, but not in any quantity nor very spicy. The garden salad (veggie pizza) in 18\" was adequate ($24). For myself I ordered the 12\" white garlic pizza with mushrooms ($15). I found the cheese to be quite hard and the pizza seemed devoid of sauce.  Unfortunately, as a former New Yorker who has eaten at the original Grimaldi's this establishment just does not measure up to the original standards.   While the place was clean and service was fair, the pizza's just aren't that good. Never before in my life have I spent $88 for pizza for 4 adults and a child. Add in a tip and you are easily over $100.  2 stars"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years since we decided to check it out after visiting Cafe Rio next door. Immediately fell in love with the place and their pizza. Simple menu, relaxed atmosphere, and always super friendly staff. We keep it simple, large pie with ricotta and sautéed pepperoni. They are consistent in quality and overall presentation. Highly recommend it for visitors and locals. Only downside is that I can't go back to crappy pizza anymore. Not like pizza hut and dominos were very good to begin with."}
{"text":"Just delicious!!!  The perfect pizza (they make their own mozzarella) and amazing staff.  Super friendly with a great sense of humor (especially after midnight!)."}
{"text":"After a terrific Yelp event at a Grimaldi's nowhere near where I live, I thought it was time to visit the one in Boca Park, close to home.  It's been open for a long time, but it was new for me.  I had sampled their private label red wine, Mille Gradi, at the event.  It's a red, which I don't drink.  But I loved it so much that I was looking forward to ordering it.  That is, until I saw the price.  I don't usually get wine that's $10 a glass (how un-Yelpy of me, I know), but threw all resolve to the wind and treated myself.  Some of the wines are reasonably priced, but more aren't.  Case in point: Sangria straight out of a bottle is $11.  I think not.  At most other places it's cheaper than all other wines, even when homemade.  I've just looked at their menu online and find that the wine prices listed are completely outdated, some as much as $3 a glass less than what you're charged at the restaurant.  This is all too common, and really pisses me off.  If I had checked it out before we went, I'd have been a bit riled.  I don't like sticker shock.  I don't think it's deliberate, just laziness, or they don't want to pay someone to update it.  I appreciate a pizza place whose decor is more like a nice restaurant than a pizza take-out.  It's pretty, warm, big but cozy, with great lighting and atmosphere.  We shared a small Mediterranean salad, and that size was actually pretty big, more than enough for the two of us to have a substantial portion. I forgot to ask for the dressing on the side, and was happy that the salad wasn't drowning in it - it had just the right amount, though some people might have to ask for more.  We got a large pizza, with green pepper, baby spinach, and sliced Roma tomatoes.  Spinach, what spinach??  You can buy a bag of baby spinach for $2 bucks and wallpaper at least 10 pizzas with it.  On our pizza, no slice had more than one leaf, a few of those were burned beyond recognition, and too many had none at all.  I'm not one to shut up and eat, so I brought it to the attention of the waitress.  The manager came over, too, and they offered to remake the whole pizza.  To their credit, and our surprise, they didn't take the first pizza and throw it out, but asked us if we wanted to take it home, along with the leftover new pizza.   I did enjoy the final pizza, though the (red) sauce is a bit light.  I prefer chunky tomatoes and a heavier sauce.  But I did like the crust, because it was crisp and not salty.  The service was excellent, and the manager, David, was extremely friendly and chatty, which we like.  Maybe it was his NY accent, though he's from upstate, but not too far upstate :)  I wish that Grimaldi's wasn't so pricey, because it will impact future visits.  We'll definitely return, but not as often as we might like."}
{"text":"Most people including myself like the pizza. Thin and crunchy on the edges with their house made mozzarella cheese. The cheesecake is also pretty good."}
{"text":"Great pizza and Mediterranean salad. Don't order too many toppings because the crust doesn't cook as well."}
{"text":"I came here for one of my birthday celebrations. If you sign up for their newsletter you get a free one topping pizza. Who can live with one topping? I can't so we added the jalapenos, and onions with the free sausage topping.The pizza was delicious! We also ordered the Caesar Salad which is really fresh.  I saw no limp Romaine lettuce leaves in there . They don't have garlic bread but you can order a side of bread if you want it with your salad. The bread comes out nice and warm! We ended our meal with some slices of cheesecake. The cheesecakes flavors change according to season. I chose one that had chocolate and caramel...can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Went to check out this place one night for dinner with my cousin after seeing an ad in one of the local newspapers and being from New York we had to see for ourselves if this place even compared to Lombardi's or the Original Grimaldi's in NYC. First the menu is simple in the good way, salads, pizzas, calzones, strombolis, and desserts and thats about it. Everything is fresh and made to order. We ordered a large (18\") pizza with sausage, meatballs and roasted garlic. I though the pizza was excellent and had plenty of flavor and very filling. My cousin thought it could be crisper but just ask your waiter to cook it a little longer for that extra crunch or if you have to many toppings can make it soggy. Maybe the coal oven need to be seasoned more. The decor seems to be standard New York with black and white pictures of famous locals like the Brooklyn bridge Empire State bldg. etc... This place is new to Vegas but old school when it comes to pizza. Not as good as Lombardi's in NYC but it the best out here!"}
{"text":"Always a great Tuesday night stop. Half price wine and get the pizza with rocatta cheese and it will be the bomb."}
{"text":"We've been to Grimaldi's a few times in the passes and have been pleased. Love a coal fired pizza! This visit was based on location and needing to get back to a meeting at the Wynn next door. The experience was typical, food was as good as usual. What made it stand out was their extensive wine list. The waiter did a good job of describing g the list and his favorites and recommendation. Sadly, none of us took him up on it - but he did have a terrific selling tactic!"}
{"text":"Grimaldies takes too long with the orders to go I've waited 30 min when I called about 1h before that to make the order"}
{"text":"closest thing to back home pizza as you can get.  I really enjoy it here.  one thing we didn't know about was that from 4-445 each day (so they say) is that they clean the ovens to prepare for the dinner crowd.  however, they stay open... so what happened for us was that we got in at 345 and sat down and they told us that the ovens will be cleaned during the next hour so no pizza, just apps, salads, and the bar pretty much.  It WAS an inconvenience, since it's not really located in a mall that you can walk around in, but since you're already there, we figured we might as well wait.  we ended up ordering dessert first to get a head start.  it took awhile, but eventually the pizzas came out and they are always so good.  thin and crispy - they way we like it.  we will be back, just not around those times."}
{"text":"Basic pizzeria. Nothing really stood out here. Soda was flat and so is the pizza. Food was good, but not great. Service was good, but again, not great. A little over priced in my opinion for the food. Tables were definitely crowded. We order a large pizza - $18 with pepperoni -  $2 and sun dried tomatoes -  $4. Total came to $26 and some change. Frankly, Dominoes is better."}
{"text":"It must be the NY water because for some reason, the pizza here tastes better than anywhere else I've had. I have eaten here twice already and both times, the food and service have been great. On both times, we custom-made our own pizzas. You can opt for half toppings as well in case you plan to share with other people. A large pizza is enough to feed a party of 4. I have had the caprese salad both time with fresh, bright red tomatos and delicious mozzarella cheese. The spinach salad was also good when I tried it my recent visit.   I have not had to wait for a table as of yet. Their desserts I have heard many good things about but have not tried. The pizza and salad makes me full enough. The restaurant is located inside Palazzo by the shoppes. Will see me dining here more often"}
{"text":"I crave their crispy, thin crust pizza! It always tastes fresh, including the mozz! Today, the waitress remembered our order and didn't wait to bring us our drinks when she saw us come in! Nice!"}
{"text":"I really love Grimaldi's! This particular visit, I had the small caesar salad, which could definitely feed two people! We also got a large pepperoni pizza which came out nice and hot! It was huge for us two and just ended up taking the rest home. Overall, it was an amazing dinner.   NOTE: On busy days, parking is a little tough and I had to park a little away from the restaurant on the street, which wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"The food is consistent, the staff is always pleasant and the price is really good. If you're in the area I would definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Having been to the NYC Grimaldi's on several occasion, I visited the Palazzo location with low expectations. To my surprise, it was awesome and make no  mistake, this was a tough crowd! Group of 10, many of which were native Sicilians living in Yonkers. Five pizza and a couple of antipasto and although the last pizza took a while, they pulled it off with respect. Well played."}
{"text":"Mmmm, its just a perfect pizza every single time! I'm not a pizza crust eater but this is just amazing! The sauce the cheese, the pepperoni, the meatball...and the craziest part is I don't need ranch because the flavors are amazing ya just don't need it, its no wonder why they don't sell it!"}
{"text":"Always consistently decent food and wine. They have a pretty good selection of wine by the glass at a reasonable price. I usually go with a red..... I always get the Caesar Salad and it is a perfect size to share. Dressing is really good and they aren't stingy with the fresh shaved parmesan. The White Pizza with Garlic is my favorite. I always add basil cooked into the pizza and on occasion add meatball.  The crust is a thin crispy crust, very tasty, but I don't like to load it up with too many toppings. I like a thicker crust to help handle the weight of lots of stuff on my pizza. That is one of the main downfalls of this place........ A somewhat limited menu. You are getting salad and thin crust pizza.  Period."}
{"text":"Overpriced bread with a dearth of toppings combined with a frumpy and frugly manager named Lauren makes the old town Scottsdale location a 1 star experience.    If I could give Lauren minus 4 stars I would!   After 20+ pizzas, let me share my experiences - this is simply another overpriced \"chain\" restaurant:  First the toppings: ... If you want anything besides carbs and bread this isn't your place.   Second the service: ...The entire staff acts as if they are doing you a favor taking your order or bringing your food.  It is not unusual to order a pizza \"to go\" and walk in to find no one at the bar.  This would be OK sans the fact that the hostess, manager and other wait staff look at you and then proceed to stand around and pick their nose until whomever has the bar comes back from their conversation with their co-workers or whatever they are doing NOT behind the bar. This typically involves checking their cell phone in the area between the bar and dining room near the patio door where I am going to guess there are no video cameras.   Third the pizza: ... All the people \"raving\" about this place are the same people spending 12 hours a day on facebook... the same people who need to be part of the \"in\" crowd.  I call them sheep or sheeple.... Sbarros at the mall has better pizza. PizzaME! has better pizza. Even the chipotle of pizza (mypie) has significantly better pizza.  There is nothing special about thin bread with a tiny amount of sauce and tiny pepperoni's.  I guess you'll  \"rave\" about toppings when you only get 3 per slice if you are an idiot.    I am sure it is a great business because their portion allocation is absurd. You mean you want cheese AND toppings AND sauce on your pizza. What do you think this is a pizza place ??    Now for Ms. Lauren: Dear Lauren.  Thank you for taking the time to \"educate me\" on exactly how much ricotta cheese should be on my pizza.  If you had anything more than a moderate education, you would have looked up my phone number and seen that I've ordered the exact same pie no less than 12+ times in the past year!   Yes I can clearly see half of the pizza has a tiny crumble of ricotta cheese. I'll post the photo here for your boss to see.  FYI Lauren, my vision is perfect. Its actually 20/15 (better than 20/20) and I have the cognitive powers to recognize when someone in the kitchen messed up.  I totally appreciate calling in my order and then waiting 8 minutes for you to arrive with my extra topping to lecture me about your staff's problem....  as if I somehow called the order in because I wanted to wait 20 minutes to pickup a \"to go\" order and listen to your frugly, frumpy attitude at 2:30 in the afternoon when you don't even have 4 tables occupied.  It's a fun waste of my time telling me how the pizza is correct when I am the person buying and eating it.  I've only talked to 3 other managers who have all said it's not problem if you need more cheese.  I guess they are all wrong and so I am... You are right Lauren.  Go ahead and threaten to \"charge me extra\" next time.  That just ensures there will be no next time and maybe management will fire your frumpy butt and hire back more attractive and sociable managers who don't argue with customers over 30cents in toppings....  Did I mention the furgly and frumpy?  When you get fired please go start a restaurant chain called \"frugly and frumpies\".  I hereby grant you the trademark to the name. I am sure you'll fill the house with your awesome persona.    Then when people order, you can threaten them with extra charges as if you are doing them a favor after they have signed the check.  Brilliant idea.  You'll go far in life.  And hopefully that is far away from Scottsdale."}
{"text":"White pizza with garlic.......I add basil... Yum!!! Soooo good... Thin crust... fresh ingredients! The perfect lunch!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pizza places in town . . . Look out for a long wait on weekend evenings however lunch time usually has a quick turn around.  White pizza with tomatoes, mozzarella and basil is my favorite.  Request they add the basil at the end of firing or it is a bit crispy and unenjoyable to my liking."}
{"text":"I'm usually against going to chain restaurants while in Vegas, but I'll gladly make an exception for Grimaldi's. They use Brooklyn water for their pizza dough and it will change your life.  The ingredients are top notch. My regular order is a pepperoni/garlic/ricotta pizza with a root beer."}
{"text":"What an impeccable dining experience my family had on a whim.  We just got to LV from LA and asked a local at the first exit in Vegas what's good around for Pizza.  We were pointed a couple miles off I-15 to this gem.  They do it up in a coal-brick fired oven.  Very good pie on a crispy thin crust.  Pepperoni's, cheese, and sauce were all very fresh.  The service was the best I have ever had from any restaurant including any 4-5 star expensive \"Morton's\" type places.  Restaurant was full but they managed to set up a table for our tired fam of four within 5 minutes.  Food and drink were quick.  They checked in on us a couple of times including management.  Just simply a perfect dining experience that I don't think I could re-create.  We felt like high rollers in a suburban area of Vegas.  Incredible!"}
{"text":"Our fave! We used to eat here all the time when we lived in Glendale. We moved to Flagstaff 4 years ago, but every time we are in the area we HAVE to come here.  We get the meatball or pepperoni, and a house salad.  Great service. Amazing pizza. This might be the only thing I would transplant from PHX to Flagstaff."}
{"text":"Super good fresh hot thin crust pizza. Order the house salad nice tangy vinaigrette. Get the Don pizza plenty meat but the Brooklyn bridge is the one. Friendly service and one supah cool bartender."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat the other day. Restaurant is set in Boca Park of Summerlin. When I walked in, I immediately noticed the place was packed and buzzing with energy. Our hostess was friendly, and walked me over to my group that was already seated. We ordered a small pizza, and it was PLENTY for three people. The pizza was fantastic! Although the price was a little high for my wallet, I would definitely return to try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Just had a nice large pizza with pepperoni, sausage and shrooms.  Awesome!  i love the thin crust style and the perfectly melted cheese.  Great service, great atmosphere and as mentioned... GREAT pizza!  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Came here for a team luncheon. They were great in accommodating 24 people. Brady our server was awesome. Pizza was delicious! Thin crust! Very very tasty! Cesar salad was great! I'm going to make sure I come back before I go back home!"}
{"text":"Flew out here from New York for my daughter's graduation from ASU.  Of course we had to stop here for pizza and hosted 8 people.  Everything was great, The Don, The Brooklyn Bridge and even the vegetable pizza was awesome.  The cheese cake was great as well.  My only issue was the coffee sucked. I'll be back though and will still recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have only ever had this as a late night pizza and this was my first time having it fresh. What delicious pizza with great flavors.  We were here for a small babyshower and the staff was great and patient with us. We had apps of spinach artichoke dip, bruschetta and antipasta. The dip was to die for...I could have gone swimming in it.  Then they brought out salads (house and ceasar) and a ton of different varieties of pizza. All were fantastic but I really loved the cheese- I know that sounds boring but when its good its good.  I don't know why we don't order this pizza more often but I need to start getting it or going to the restaurant once in a while."}
{"text":"It's all about New York style pizza. Deep dish is so overrated. For me, pizza is all about the crust and Grimaldi's did a great job of baking the pizza to the right crispiness. Out of the many things we ordered, my favorite was the Mushroom Chicken. The sauce had a great flavor and the cheese was so fresh it made me want to punch babies. The white sauce pizza was good but it didn't have enough flavor for me. I still ate a bunch of slices though. Our server was really nice and attentive. Good food, good service, good times."}
{"text":"Great New York feel. Service was great. Just pizzas and Salads. Salad was very fresh, large Pizza was huge and fed my family of 4 with some leftover to take back to hotel for a snack later.  Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the doors (which were opened for us), the aroma hits your nose and it's wonderful. Walk by the open kitchen and it smells even better.   We decided to order their special for the month, a bruschetta pizza. It was a thin crust pizza with just enough cheese, basil, and tomatoes on it. Our waiter recommended drizzling some oil and vinegar on it to enhance the flavors. It really did. The pizza tasted exactly like bruschetta and it was scrumptious."}
{"text":"Very subpar service but delicious pizza.      The food is tasty but each time we've eaten here (5 times) we've been amazed at how difficult it is to get a soda refill. It may seem like a small thing but I've never experienced it at another restaurant in Las Vegas like at Grimaldi's on Eastern. Three different servers and each one let our two drinks sit empty for 15-20 minutes before refilling. On our last visit we got our sodas filled when we sat and weren't offered refills until we were brought the check 45 minutes later.     I understand they are busy, and deservingly so, but the place isn't huge and we sat in plain sight; they walked by our table at least half a dozen times.   Three stars may seem harsh because the pizza is great and the staff is friendly, but the soda thing is an issue that's happened too many times in a row to ignore."}
{"text":"let me just start off by saying this was my first visit after living in Vegas for 11 years.   YUMMMMM.  We typically don't go out for pizza often (we make our own) but I had received a free 16in one topping pizza coupon for my birthday so why not.  We arrived a little before 5pm on a Friday.  They informed us that the ovens had just been something (not sure what they called it but I took it as cleaned and heating back up) but wait time for pizzas to come out was minimal.  They brought out the first pizza but apologized and said another was in the oven because the one they brought out was a little darker than they liked but we could enjoy it and a better one would be on the way (it really wasn't burnt people).  We take a bite and after bite #2, I told E I would NEVER pay $20 for this.  They're insane.  He continued to eat.  I said ehhh no flavor.  This isn't good.  So I patiently waited for the second one to come out.  They again apologized and I dove in.  One bite.......HOLY COW!  I looked at E and said you've gotta try it.  He said how different can it be?  I'm full.  I said just take a bite of mine.  He ended up eating 2 more slices lol.  We will definitely splurge on ourselves for this delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Service is awesome!!  The Summer Sangria is on point!!  Oh, and the pizza is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza with ham, mushrooms, and olives to share between 2 adults and a 3 year old.... it was gone within minutes.  It was so tasty!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to find good pizza since I moved to Vegas 6 months ago. I still haven't found it. The sauce was ok, otherwise the pie that I ordered with meatball toppings was burnt and bland. It wasn't even edible, so I definitely would not recommend it or go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza place ever!! Italian waiter, Tommy was great! House wine was sufficient and very good! Arrive around 5pm. For minimal wait time!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my birthday pizza! Hadn't been here in awhile, sure was a great family birthday dinner! The house red wine was pretty good, shared a 1/2 carafe. Cant go wrong here for tasty pizza, but FYI  there was a dying bug trapped in my wine glass  but my husband wouldn't let me say a word. He switched my glass for his, what a guy!  Still my favorite pizza place:)"}
{"text":"Had take out for Mothers Day. Subpar at best... I've dined in several times and it's been great. Will never do take out again. 80 bucks down the drain."}
{"text":"Came here with a date.  His choice, and glad he picked it.   It was a tad noisy for trying to get to know you without kinda yelling at your date across the table....Hope I didn't spit food on him. If I came with friends, the noise level would have been fine.   I arrived early, so I sat at the bar and talked to the coolest bartender, Andrea.  She was the kind of person you just get drawn in and want to chit chat with all night.  She picked out a great glass of red wine for me too!  When we say at our table, our waitress came around all bubbly and full of personality. I think her name was Kimberly.   We got the Caprese Salad to start and then tried the Diavolo pizza as our meal. Both were very delicious!!!    The pizza was that good thin crust with lots of toppings and a great tasting crust. Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is always good. But I am very disappointed in this location.  We arrived early before the rush, ordered a personal pan pizza and a salad and an hour later still no pizza or salad. When I say we got there before the rush was right, and now everyone that came in after us was already eating their pizzas... We asked the server what was up and he came back and told us that it would be another 12 or more minutes, we asked for the manager and she pretty much scoffed at us and made all kinds of excuses.  Unacceptable.  I have eaten at Grimaldi's several times and have NEVER had this kind of treatment.  The manager comped our pizza and gave us a $5.00 off coupon for next time, I will be hesitant to go back.  Obviously, the waiter didn't put our order in at all.  And when the pizza did finally arrive, it was a large, not a personal pizza size, so obviously they screwed up.  UGH!  So very disappointed."}
{"text":"My family's favorite pizza place. This location especially has wonderful service- very personable! Love the pizza too, not too heavy. We come here as a family whenever we can! Casual social and great for families or dates"}
{"text":"The service is always great! Hostesses, Waiters, waitresses, and managers are very attentive.  The pizza is the BEST! Every time I eat here I have to tell my family it reminds me of the pizza in Italy.  We probably dine here every other week or more, the pizza is consistently done well. I really like the thin crunchy crust, light tomato sauce, high quality cheeses and meat toppings. We always get a salad or two, all the salads are delicious especially the Caesar.  The house red wine is a great value and a great accompaniment to pizza.  The cannoli and tiramisu are simple but some of the best!"}
{"text":"Small pizza is good for 4 adults. Very reasonable price especially inside Palazzo Hotel. Came here after New Year's Eve party, 1:30am. They closed at 2am by the way. The server looks very tired but he still gave us good service. The Pepperoni Pizza was delicious, NY style, very thin and juicy. The sangria was very good and fruity flavor."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is my favorite pizza. The only California outpost is in El Segundo. So since we are in Vegas we just had to come back.   I love everything about their pizzas. The key thing is not overdoing it but having the right balance of crust to ingredients. These are thin crust pizzas New York style, their crust is absolutely to die for. We ordered two pizzas, a Marguerite and a bacon, olive, and artichoke white pizza.   Five stars."}
{"text":"Delicious, New York-style pizza at Fashion Show mall or Palazzo.  So, so good!  The bread is a thin, crunchy crust, but not too crunchy that you hurt the inside of your mouth.  Just fantastic!  You build your own pizzas.  The white sauce is a bit too creamy, and was ordered with a calzone, so I don't recommend that.  I had a ricotta, pepperoni, artichoke hearts, and mushroom pizza on marinara sauce and it was delicious.  They also have house bread (though it's not advertised).  Apparently they have an amazing pumpkin cheesecake during the Fall but I was too stuffed from the pizza to try... but you should!!!"}
{"text":"It was fabulous!!! My first time at a Grimaldis. I had a calzone with sweet red peppers. Perfection. The crust was not all thick and doughy, it was light, buttered, and filling was just the right amount. My friend had personal pizza, it was also mighty tasty! (We shared) our waiter Nick was also very good. We sat \"outside\""}
{"text":"It was okay. It didn't live up to the hype. I can name two or three pizza places off the top of my head in my hometown of Provo, Utah that are better. And it's not like Provo is known for it's Pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was good.  I loved the crust.  However the Caesar salad sucked.  The croutons were soft and there wasn't enough dressing.  The beer selection was just OK.  So sorry, one star lost."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's, always have and always will. If you sign up for their email newsletter, they send you a coupon for a free 18\" one-topping pizza for your birthday! My friend and I went in and ordered a caesar salad to start, a meatball pizza and a carafe of wine. Everything was delicious. The only complaint was the service was lacking. Our server never checked on us once while we were eating. Other than that, great experience!"}
{"text":"Two words: Ricotta cheese  Yes, it costs extra for all the things I like on my pizza, and I was shocked when I ordered a large and a personal pizza one night and the total was $45, but it just tastes so good. The personal pizza is definitely big enough for 2 people to enjoy.   My recommendations: - Pizza with Ricotta Cheese, Sausage and Jalapenos.  - Pizza with Ricotta Cheese, Chicken, Sun-dried Tomatoes, Basil  I don't live in Arizona, but I make a point of stopping here every time I visit. Supposedly one is opening up in Manhattan Beach, CA and I couldn't be more excited about it!"}
{"text":"Ate  there last night. Soggy crust ;(very little sausage or cheese ;( and basically worse than  frozen pizza in my opinion!!  And 100$ for 4 of us;(.  Go to Pizza Hut or call dominoes!"}
{"text":"I never fail to have good service at this place. Food is always brought in a timely manner and they have a great staff who provide great service. The management at this place is also outstanding. Count on me to always come in! My favorite pizza ever!"}
{"text":"Website lists 12\" small cheese pizza at $10.       I went to pick it up and was charged $16.44..............WHAT???? Will never go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered 1 half and half pizza that consist of half \"brooklyn pizza\" and half \"the don pizza\". However, we end up paying close to $40 for this ONE pizza. Apparently they charge the toppings for whole pizza even though each topping is only on half the pizza. This is ridiculous, and the food was not even that good."}
{"text":"They now have a limited bar which is a little disappointing. I'm not a huge beer or wine drinker so that's not exciting for me. They do have a few special drinks that involve wine but that's about it. Hey the seasonal strawberry cheesecake was good."}
{"text":"I usually stay away from chain-store pizza (Pizza Hut, Domino's, etc.), because that stuff's just not tasty.  So, I guess I have a high standard for pizza, because I was not impressed by Grimaldi's.  I mean, it was fine, but it wasn't especially flavorful or fresh.  My friends, for some reason, thought it was the best pizza they've ever had.  I guess I'm just not a big pizza person"}
{"text":"Great spot. Great with our kids and grandkids. The Don's pizza is FAB!! Salads are yum-o and huge! Great value. Our server Brett J was the best!!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the Grimaldi locations around Vegas but this one definitely has to be the nicest. It has a beautiful view of the strip on one side and elegant chandlers from the hotel on the other.  The service here was also great. Our waitress was super helpful and friendly. She recommended her favorite dishes and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal.  Now for the best part, naturally, the food. We started with the antipasto which was pretty good. My favorite part of it was the fresh mozzarella. For the pizza we decided to go with meatballs, sun dried tomatoes, onions, and garlic. The small size was just the right size for the two of us and we even had leftovers. Delicious! I highly recommend getting the meatballs on anything, they were the best part."}
{"text":"I looooove their pizza! Being from the Midwest I feel like pizza just tastes different out here, but this place is one of the fine gems I've learned to love. The best part is how many combinations you can chose to go with. You never have to have the same pizza twice.  My boyfriend and I came here recently got a small which was plenty enough to share. We started with the caprese for an appetizer which was so so but for the pizza we went with meatballs, artichoke, mushrooms, basil, garlic and sundries tomatoes. Ah-mazing! The best part is the crust being crispy throughout the whole pizza. I cannot stand soggy pizza so it's definitely a plus for me.   If you're looking for good, quality pizza look no further!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I came here for our weekly daddy daughter date and we left thoroughly impressed. The food was as advertised, but the service was AMAZING! This weekend we'll be back with the entire family. :-)"}
{"text":"Great service! They even give children a little bit of dough and a pizza pan to play with!  2 small pizzas and a large salad was more than enough for 4 people and a toddler. Get the white pizza with sausage (not your average sausage!) Also, the the pepperoni is very thick and authentic and the red sauce has chunks of chopped garlic.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"We used to go here regularly when we lived in Vegas. Great East coast coal fired pizza. NY style. Thin crust with tasty burnt edges. Little tiny pepperonis. Great location in Boca Park with nice other shops nearby. Top pizza in Summerlin area."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for pizza in Vegas!  I honestly have no complaints about this place. Seating was quick on a weeknight since there was no wait.  My family and I shared a Margarita Pizza and loved it! The crust wasn't too doughy like those at places like Pizza Hut/Dominos/etc. It was crispy, light, and tasty! The marinara sauce they use for their pizza isn't too overwhelming which made the pizza so easy to eat without getting tired of the taste.   They also had a strawberry puree drink that I'd recommend as well if you're planning to order a drink.  Definitely stopping by the next time I come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza. Very much like NY style. I only tried the pizza on this visit but will be back to sample other menue items."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my boyfriend for the first time. I always wanted to go eat there because I am a pizza lover! The setting is very fitting and had a nice vibe to the place loved the decor. Our waitress was nice and always checked on us. We ordered a small spinach salad and the 16\" Don pizza. I loved the salad, it was just enough for the two of us and the dressing was just right not too much and not too little best salad ever thanks to the waitress who said we should try it and it was her favorite! The pizza was really good but when it finally came to our table I didn't get to eat a lot because my appetite was gone, after we finished our salad we waited about 20-30 mins for our pizza. Plus I'm the type of person that eats ranch with their pizza so when I asked for a side dip of ranch our waitress said they don't have ranch but that they get a lot of requests for it. If a lot of people are requesting a certain item I think the restaurant should provide it. So overall a very good restaurant service and food, it was a busy night but next time I think I'd have to eat my salad slow and prepare my own ranch to dip m pizza in."}
{"text":"So we love this place, we love the food and man I have to say the wait it worth it. We had a seat next to the kitchen area, and the guy who made the dough was SUPER talented and he very well entertained us. The fast way of him dancing the pizza dough around was majestic .... once our pizza arrived, as always it made our date go to this place and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced for what you get. At $2 per topping I expected it to be awesome, but it wasn't even as good as Pizza Hut. Drinks were OK; The lemon drop was good, although the waiter spilled it on two people I was with. The soho shandy was just gross, it sounded really good on the menu but what I got tasted like I was getting my teeth cleaned."}
{"text":"The pizza here is the only thing I like from here but man oh man are they good. Make your own pizza and pick some random things to throw together (just not too many) and it'll still taste good. I ended up here for dinner 2 nights in a row because the people I went with the first night wanted it again a 2nd time! I wasn't impressed with how crowded the area was, but I got over that once I had myself some pizza.  Mmm pizza."}
{"text":"Only 5 stars??  That's crap.  I wish they had a 10 stars because Grimadi's would easily get that.  Some may not agree with me and there was a point in my life when I thought differently.  A few years ago I had dinner at the Chandler location for the first time.  Yeah it was good, but it was your normal fancy pizza that I figured most trendy places are doing.  I don't know what changed from then until now.  I visited this location and we had a party of about eight people.  We all showed up and went to our table. Ordered drinks and quickly ordered the pizzas.  My girlfriend ordered us a pesto pizza with olives and mushrooms.  Others ordered various ones and when they brought them out, we went to town.  For years I've been a pizza lover and some of my favorite pizza places are even on here, but I gotta say that Grimaldi's is now my favorite pizza place I have ever been to.  I took a bite of that pesto pizza and almost fell off my chair.  I couldn't believe how good it was.  People make jokes at me sometimes because I get rediculous when it comes to good food.  Well, its because I love dining out and when the food and service is great, I get a little extra excited.  I also tried some of their sausage with cheese and couldn't seem to say no to more.  Quick note about their pizza.. it is THIN crust pizza.  Think Oregano's and NYPD Pizza had a kid and that kid became President.  That's Grimaldi's (at least in my book).  I had 4.5 slices..  yea yeah yeah.. but it was soooo good.  I even told our server \"dude, this is the best pizza I have ever eaten.\"  he patted me on the back and said \"Awe yeah, that's what we love to hear.\"  I can't wait to go back here again.    Thank you for an awesome time Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"I recently lived in NY for 3 years so I have been dying for this style of pizza. It is the best. Grimaldi's was great...so close to what I am used to in NY. Honestly, it was close enough. Great pizza. I will definitely be going back next time (and every time) I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is known for their New York style thin crust pizzas made in a coal fired brick oven. This location in Scottsdale quarter has a beautiful decor those red checkered tablecloths have an old world pizzeria charm.  They have an elaborate selection of Red,white and Rose wines.The large 18\" pizza is $18 and you have to pay $2-$5 (depending on what you get) for every additional topping which i feel is a little steep. We ordered a half and half large pizza with various toppings like grilled chicken,mushrooms,black olives,green pepper,onions,sundried tomatoes,spicy chicken sausage and ricotta cheese.They do not have pineapples which is one of my favorite pizza toppings. The pizza itself was nice and service is good.They are pretty full all the time and parking can be a problem.  I had a Rose wine which tasted fine (i'm no wine connoisseur).The Calzones here are pretty famous but i was too stuffed to try any.They also have a dessert trio for $10 which is so delish (choose any three options from cheesecakes,cannolis and tiramisu).If anything i recommend saving some room for dessert.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places ever! Grimaldis always has my heart . I usually always get the pesto pizza and add toppings such as kalamata olives, ricotta, and onion. Their red sauce pizza is amazing too. And they make it fresh every time using a brick oven."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's pizza! My go to place whenever I am craving delicious NY style pizza. Oven coal baked to perfection. I have been here enough times and with every visit, the food and service has been on point. Great salads, full bar, and their tiramisu is simply delicious!"}
{"text":"This is arguably some of the best pizza I've had! The biggest point is that it is consistently good. My kids love it! We used to go to the Old Town Scottsdale location, but this location is just as good. It does get very busy starting around 5pm, so just prepare for that. But their pizza and house red wine are awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Great service! Came out in a proper amount of time. Seated right away. Beautiful decor. Coming from Chicago, I have been spoiled as far as pizza goes and this is my new favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh...it's nice to be back!  We hadn't been here in a while, and had actually forgotten what delicious pizza tastes like.  I love their menu, simple and to the point...salads, pizzas and calzones.  We started off with a small caesar salad, which could feed 3-4 people.  It was tangy and fresh tasting, with crunchy croutons.  We couldn't stop eating it.  But, then our pizza arrived...a large with ricotta, fresh sliced tomatoes and half meatball...mouth-watering!  I've never been a big fan of overly sauced pizza, and this always has just the right amount on it.  The crust is the perfect vehicle for their fresh ingredients.  My husband finished off his slices, and I took home half of mine (to be enjoyed later).  The staff was very nice, but the food was \"MWAAAH\"!!  We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We have gone to two Grimaldi's locations.  This location is closer to where we live than the Old Town Scottsdale location and easier to access due to a better parking situation.  We usually start with the small Antipasto (it helps keep the kids busy while we wait for our pizza).  My favorite part of the Antipasto is the red peppers, they are very flavorful and compliment the dish well.  We always order two pizzas, one small with cheese for the boys (there is no kids menu) and one large with half pepperoni, half garlic for my husband and I.  The quality of the pizza is always consistently great.  The garlic is not overpowering and is complimented well by the coal-fired flavor from the oven.  The pepperoni is very tasty and even a little on the spicy side.  The pizza is so fresh and delicious we have to persuade ourselves into saving some slices for the next day.  We love to have a cold slice for breakfast!  The only issue we have had at this location is plates with food residue.  We asked our server for two clean plates and one of them was dirty as well. He returned with another clean one and we had no other issues.  We only had an issue with the plates one time, so I would not say it is a chronic problem.  We always finish with a cannoli, they are too good to pass up!  They are filled with a rich cream with chocolate chips mixed in and sprinkled on top.  It is the perfect ending to a great meal!  Overall we always have a good experience when we go to Grimaldi's.  We have never had to wait for a table at this location, which is great when dining out with children!  I always recommend Grimaldi's to my co-workers and friends who are looking for great pizza.  On our last visit I got a free one topping large pizza for my birthday after I signed up for their mailing list! Great perk for a fan of Grimaldi's!  I would recommend giving them a shot if you appreciate a great slice!"}
{"text":"First time to this location.  We were sat quickly,  even on a busy Friday night when the dining room appeared  packed. Our server was friendly,  prompt, and efficient.  We ordered a 16\" white with garlic pizza topped with ricotta and it did not disappoint! My daughter and I absolutely loved it! I'm looking forward to my left overs for sure. At 19$ for a pizza, this was definitely a splurge for us.... but absolutely worth it! This would have been a 5 star visit if it weren't for all of the chaos in the location. I typically visit the Casa Paloma location, the layout  of that one allows  you to relax a bit more, seating here felt cramped and forced. I'll be back for the pizza, not the ambience."}
{"text":"The service at this place is always on point. I've ordered for large groups and they're always accommodating. Watch out for the cheesecake it's to die for...."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying, I loVVVe Grimaldi's . I have gone to every location in Vegas, multiple times. Some more than others. We Always get the same thing. Caesar salad & pepperoni pizza..not that adventurous but anyone who knows Grimaldi's, knows their menu is not huge. Totally ok as their items are  scrumptious, juicy & the Very \"Best of Lasvegas\". I have been here so many times Ive lost count.. if u want a great pizza in Vegas, find a Grimaldi's. I have 1 issue, which Im hoping will not become a regular one..I'm also in love with their Caesar salad & their perfectly baked browned croutons! With a small list of ingredients, 1 thing can throw the whole experience off in a salad &..it finally happened:(.. hoping the chef was just busy that day??? The croutons were pale, uncooked, flavorless & blaaa...aa..aaa.a:(..normally, they're fantastic! I spoke to the waitress & I could feel the reaction though her face didn't show it. She brought me more..but to no avail..the same lame, lifeless, bodi less crouton..:( U cant have a great Caesar salad without a great crouton..just my 2cents..Im hoping it was just busy that day..tho mid day on a week day.. the menu is small, so I hope I dont lose my loVe for their Caesar salad here.. keep the croutons in the oven longer, Pleeaaassee. \"Its in the details\", noT just the pizza.:) If u r looking for a stellar pizza joint, Grimaldi's is it.."}
{"text":"I love a good pizza and Grimaldis delivers.  The tomato sauce used for the pizza tastes homemade and the cheese used is real mozzarella instead of that shredded stuff most restaurants gets from the local restaurant depot.  I love a crisp crust with a slight chewiness.    The sausage and mushroom is best, the chicken pesto is good but I've had better."}
{"text":"Pizza cooked in a coal oven? I've heard of brick oven and wood fire, but coal? Ok I'll give it a shot.  WOW DELISH! Some of the best pizza I have EVER had! Who knew this fossil fuel could help produce heavenly bites of pizza?! I went at lunch time and was promptly sat at the bar. The place is a little small so I can imagine the wait time at peak hours can be long. The bartender was nice and since it was my first time, he explained the menu and how the pizza is made. I decided on a personal 12\" pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, and kalmata olives.  I waited about 20 minutes until the food arrived, which isn't bad for lunch. Yumm the smell of the pizza was divine! My first bite overtook my senses. Explosions of flavor all around my mouth, crunchy, gooey, saucy, melty goodness!! I quickly ate about 6 pieces in no time flat. I decided to take a breather before I was knocked into a pizza coma. As I was paying for my check, the two gentleman sitting next to me at the bar asked if they could have my 2 left over slices while they waited for their order......yes people the pizza is that good that strangers will ask for your leftovers!!  I have become a believer! Grimaldi's is hands down the best pizza I have ever had! This says a lot because I spent 6 months in Italy and thought nothing in the US would be able to compare, but I was wrong. Grimaldi's is the shizzz!"}
{"text":"There is one pizza here I love  - the white pizza with garlic, with 2 toppings - pesto and ricotta cheese! May sound like a strange combo but it is phenomenal! The antipasto salad is also good - with mozzarella, oven roasted sweet red peppers, Genoa salami, olives, and bread. What I think is weird about this place is they don't have garlic bread. They do have a nice selection of beer and wine. The price isn't that fantastic, and the crust is too done, but I will be going back for my favorite pizza!"}
{"text":"Easily some of the best pizza I have ever had! Love the thin crust reminds me of New York.  Its an absolute must try for those who appreciate substance over quantity."}
{"text":"My wife and I  split a personal pizza. Great pizza, and a super friendly staff. We had the Brooklyn bridge special. Fast service too."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's pizza= ultra thin =   ultra expensive = ultra lousey  the only place where I could eat a whole pie, because of its skimpiness  wow, please serve me more cracker w/ brushed on tomato and sprinkling of cheese  UNBELIEVABLE !!!!"}
{"text":"I went here the other night with a group of girlfriends since they do 1/2 price wine on Tuesday nights. A fantastic deal but alas, this past Tues. was the end of that promotion. Hopefully they bring it back in the future because without that, I am not sure I would visit again. I liked the decor and our service was great but nothing about the food really wowed me enough to make me want to come back.   We started with the caprese salad. The ingredients were very fresh but very basic. Beefsteak tomatoes and generic balsamic. Basically, it was ok but I could have made it just as good myself with ingredients from the grocery store. The pizza is billed as New York style but I don't agree since it was not soft enough to fold in half. It is more that crispy thin brick oven variety that has become so popular lately.... my husband refers to it as \"crunchy pizza\". And I know that the whole coal-fired thing is kind of their trademark but I did not enjoy the black carbon residue all over my fingers when I picked up a slice. Minus one star for that.   Overall the food was ok and our server was super nice. Very friendly but not overly intrusive. She did disappear after bringing us the bill but another server stepped in to take our cards. So they have good team work which is nice to see. I also liked the brick walls and wine bottle light fixtures; although it definitely feels like a chain they still aren't too boring about it. One thing I did not like was the seating. They only had a couple of booths along the walls and they were all full so we had to sit at a table in the center of the restaurant that was not nearly big enough to accommodate four people and a large pizza in the middle. The size of the tables and the rigid, armless chairs does not make you want to hang out and enjoy wine and conversation. Which is sad since they did have a solid list of lower to mid-range bottles at reasonable prices.  I think this would be a fine place to take a family out for dinner but not the best for a date night or girls night."}
{"text":"What an awful experience. Pizza was rather good however, the service at this place is abysmal. We thought that the menu was lacking in options and seemed rather limited. With the lack of options on the menu it's hard to feed picky children. You don't want to cater to them? well, we'll go somewhere else. However, that was the least of the issues with this disaster experience.   Anti-pasta as a starter was fresh and nice and we ordered the pizza it came out hot and tasted nice and fresh. I liked the pizza as I used to live in NY, but my wife didn't.   Service at the table was somewhat slow too. Forgot our bar order and then it took nearly 10 minutes to get it when we reminded the sever about it. I was nearly done eating when it arrived.   Server auto-check dropped with no offer of dessert. So my wife and the kids went across the way to Frost Ice Cream for dessert and I went to the bar to have a glass of wine and watch the game. I sat at the bar for seven minutes without being greeted and nearly walked out. The bartender in passing then said \"did you want to eat something?\" and I said no I had already eaten I want to have a glass of wine. She brought me the menu for food and beer but no wine list. I ended up sitting there another 12 MINUTES before she addressed me again saying \"you need something?\" REALLY, nearly 20 minutes at the bar empty handed and she wonders if I need something.    With that said, I had set our leftover pizza box on the bar when I sat down. While I was seated the bartender took it off the bar top and put it underneath the bar. I didn't think much of it as I suspected that she put it there for safekeeping and to free up bar space.   Anyhow, it took nearly 20 minutes from the time I sat down to the time I got a glass of wine which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous. In the time that my wife the kids were gone I probably would've had two glasses of wine and a Sambuca but I barely had time to finish the one glass. I went to tab out and this also took way too long as my wife and the kids stood behind me at the bar waiting for 10 minutes while I tabbed out. Once this painstaking process was finished she took the check presenter and walked away without comment or eye contact. I had to call her back and say, \"hey, can I have my pizza so we can go please?\" She then looked at me with the quizzical face and said, \"What pizza?\" I reminded her of my pizza she put under the bar and she returned, \"oh, I didn't know that was yours I threw it out.\" I looked at her and said, \"There was half of a large pizza in there.\" She looked at me with a blank stare and said, \"I can have you made a personal pizza and only take about 10 minutes?\" I said no that's not acceptable. First, I had a half large pizza in there and second, we have to go now because the kids have school in the morning.\" She said \"oh okay\" and then turns her back on us and goes to the register without further comment. Offering no further solution to the problem she created. I found that absolutely astonishing and insulting. To throw my pizza away and then give me a lame solution was stupid. (The pizza we ordered was like 25 or $28 and personal pizzas is like 10 bucks) To just turn your back on us and leave us standing there like Hobo Joe's was really incredible and surreal.  I'll never come back to this place. I dropped $125 in this pizza joint and left really pissed off.   Lastly, one of my employees had been dining with us and he was so upset he called the manager. The manager asked him for my name and address and said that he would contact me to discuss what had happened. Whatever, I didn't really care anymore and just simply won't ever go back. There's lot of places to spend money at. Like a week later I got a $25 gift card in the mail with absolutely no explanation, no letter, no contact name, and no verbiage whatsoever except my name scribbled on it - and they misspelled my friggin name as well.  All this really insulted me a 2nd time. Like throwing a gift card at me remedies that crappy experience. I threw their lame offering in the trash. Hope your happy with my $125.00 as you'll never see a cent out of us again."}
{"text":"The wait staff to the food was top notch. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in Arizona."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. I've been here too many times to count. The food and service is always exceeding expectations, never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Excellent mouthwatering coal-fired brick oven Pizza tucked inside the Palazzo/Venetian, friendly staff with fast service, if your hungry and are looking for decent pizza & a peaceful lunch to get away from the crowds of the Strip than I say this is definitely a stop for Pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is located in Boca Park near the Cheese Cake Factory. Parking is awful there when they are busy, but they do offer valet parking if you would rather not walk a half mile or drive around looking for a spot all day.  They have outside seating as well as seating inside. There is also a bar inside the restaurant. The staff is very friendly and we did not have to wait too long for our food.  As far as the pizza goes, it's not bad. It is definitely over priced. It is good thin crust pizza. I can't tell the difference between coal oven pizza and wood fire pizza, but they use a coal oven. It is definitely not NY pizza. I would compare it to pizza like you would get at Sammy's.  The salads were were plain and bland, just like most pizza places serve their salads.  Again. It is expensive for a pizza in this place. Each item is $2 or $3 extra, depending on the item. One pizza with a few items really adds up.  I would recommend trying it though if you have never been there. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I come to/order from every now and then and when I do I wonder why I don't come more often...  Honestly, I usually get takeout but the restaurant itself is very cool. There's an Italian/New York vibe to it. There's lots of seating and a nice patio. There's also a bar upfront. Any server/bartender/manager/etc who I've dealt with is always friendly.   The pizza is delicious! It's thin crust, which is what I like. The sauce & cheese is what's interesting. The pizza isn't real cheesy and it seems as if there's more sauce on it, which isn't how I would normally like it, but the sauce is SO GOOD and the cheese is just the right amount. Any topping that I've had has been delicious and fresh. I particularly like the artichoke.   A couple of other notes:  1) They do a FREE large pizza on your birthday when you're on there email list (actually, it doesn't have to be right on your birthday...there's a bit of a grace period). This is a great deal!  2) It's a really great place for events/parties. There's a a good sized room with it's own bar that can be reserved and there's a catering menu. I had my grad school graduation party here many years ago, and everything was great. Also, my family did a luncheon there couple years ago after my father's funeral and they were EXTREMELY accommodating. Obviously, this was something that had to be put together on very little notice and Grimaldi's was awesome about it. Luckily, since it was on a weekday they basically just gave us the room and just order what we wanted on site."}
{"text":"Always loved Grimaldi's. My daughter has a dairy allergy, so we ordered her a chicken salad and said not include the feta due to a dairy allergy. Got home with takeout and there was feta all over the salad. Disappointed that they did not take the allergy seriously and that the person picking up forgot to double check."}
{"text":"The cousin and I spent the day at the spa then stumbled, blissed out, in search of carbs. I can't imagine a better day... can you?   Across the way we found this pizza joint where they do NY Style pies and ordered a white pie with plenty of garlic. We added and it came with big chunks of bacon, black olives and artichokes-the small was PLENTY for two people with a slice left over so no need to spend more than that if you're just dining with a pal.   They had a peanut butter cup cheesecake on the menu that we just barely made it out alive without. We were so tempted but so full from the pizza. Next time, that cheesecake won't be so lucky.   They serve Diet Pepsi if you drink that junk- The cousin does much to my scolding and was delighted-as everywhere else we had been all weekend was Coke.   We sat at the bar which was chill and comfy and the place was totally dead between 3 and 5 when we were there in the off afternoon hours. A nice place with good eats to stop if you need a casual bite but don't want to eat and walk."}
{"text":"Not that impressive considering they've won awards left and right. I'm from Chicago and so it's going to be rather difficult to outdo some of the places in good old Chi-Town. Of course, I did consider that this was NY style-- which I do enjoy quite a bit, but the reality remains that we even have a NY style pizzeria in not-so-pizza friendly Sonoma County that beats this joint to a pulp (Mombo's). I will give credit where it's due and say that the crust was tasty and the sauce nice and tangy. In fact, the crust adopted some of the charcoal flavor from the brick ovens-- which was a nice surprise in terms of flavor. I'll add that they didn't look at us as if we were idiots when my vegan partner asked for \"no cheese\" and inquired if the sauce had chicken broth.  The service was great, though and I wouldn't object to going back if I had pizza on the brain and was back in Scottsdale. Surely there must be better, though!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza. Ordered a personal pan with mushrooms to go. Very convenient, fast, and efficient to-go service."}
{"text":"Great service! Two hostesses and the manager greeted me as soon as I walked in the door. I ordered online and it was so fast and easy!"}
{"text":"This was a sad experience... we came in to celebrate granddaughter's 5th grade graduation.  We went here a few years ago nice pizza but today's waitstaff- Austin was lacking... got here at 5 and the place was empty..  I ordered a large Antipasto plate and we had our drink orders... in the past they would bring pizza dough for the kids to play with- my 3  year old grandson and 11 granddaughter wanted dough... had to ask the waiter even though the table behind us with children around the same age got a platter full of dough silly thing to complain about but she is at that age that still wants to be include in the fun of playing.  By the time he got around to give ONE dough our pizza arrived!  Ugh total fail in entertaining a 3 Year old and totally excluding an 11 year old!   Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"We were first timers and had a blast and had outstanding service! Tricia and Andrea went above and beyond to make our visit exceptional! Tricia made great menu recommendations , and when sambooka was asked for she found it!  Tuesdays are half off wine bottles as well and we came on the right night! I came by with my birthday coupon for a free pizza and glad I made the stop ! See you next Tuesday Grimaldis !!"}
{"text":"Great and amazing pizza, the only complaint here is this day in age you figure a company would have a good beer selection."}
{"text":"I should start to lower my expectations when I try out new places. Recently I've been walking into over-hyped places only to get an average experience.  Its 4 pm on a Wednesday afternoon, and the place barely has 1-2 families eating there. That's ok, it must just be the time of day. I like the quiet, peaceful restaurants anyways. Cool decorations, a nice variety of seating, and dirty plates on the tables seemed to be the norm. My plate along with my significant other's plate had weird dirt, or ash from coal on it. Seriously? If I'm paying $15 for a 12\" pizza I'm hoping the plates I get are at least clean. Oh well, what can I expect, I'm in Scottsdale.  This is totally the \"trust-fund-pizza-place\". Pretty much every family dining here was sippin' on dat kriss. Ok, maybe not Hypnotik, but they were ALL drinking fine wine. I don't drink alcohol, but still, this place seemed a little too posh for me. I just wanted to see what the buzz was about.   We got half plain-red and half-'white' with garlic. The traditional pizza was pretty darn good, the sauce was probably some of the most perfect sauce I've had, and there was enough cheese on there, but not enough to make the pizza ridiculously oily. However, don't go in here thinking you're gonna get as much cheese as a Pizza Hut pizza. The white side was pretty good as well, the garlic taste was subtle despite the large amounts of minced garlic. The only downside is that the white pizza had way too much cheese in contrast to the other side, and thus it was a little bit too oily. To make things worse, the worst part about the pizza was that the crust was too crispy. Gourmet, wood-fire? That's cool and all, but no one likes an overdone crust that is essentially a cracker with (sauce and) melted cheese. This was sort of the deal breaker for me unfortunately. I thought the rest of the pizza was tasty, but I had a hard time understanding the rough crust.  Its funny because they had like 30 employees there when I went. It was rather annoying to see a bunch of employees joking around, walking around aimlessly, and needlessly destroying the atmosphere of a cool restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the pizza isn't spectacular, but it's a cool place to go for a business meeting or to treat your significant other. I wonder if my pizza is overpriced because the place is overstaffed?  If you have a trust fund this place will be your favorite place. If you don't, then you'll come here once and only once just to say you've been here. If you don't follow hype, then don't worry about making your way over ehre."}
{"text":"Ordered a small pepperoni, jalapeno and sausage pie with extra sauce to go. It was so so yum. Honestly words can't describe. Total and absolute must for that pizza craving or a tough day followed by relaxing in your room. Will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"This Grimaldis has definitely gone down the toilet.   I've been going since the day they opened.   Awful management. Worse waiters and dreadful quality of pizzas.   As Jack Nicholson says in Batman, This (restaurant) needs an enema."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's serves up thin crust pizza with fresh, flavorful ingredients.  A friend of ours reserved a room for a promotion party, and we came here in anticipation of tasty pizza.  The party started with some crisp salad with a bottle of vinaigrette and garlic bread. Then, came the parade of pizzas.  The whole entire table was filled with various types of pizza to satisfy even the pickiest eater.  The pizza had a very thin crust, layered with various fresh ingredients such as ricotta, mozzarella, sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms.  The pizza sauce was robust and more paste-like (To prevent the pizza from getting soggy I'd imagine).  My favorite of the plethora of pizzas I tried was a lovely ricotta mushroom pizza with fresh mozzarella.  The only slight negative was that it was very easy for the pizza to get cold since the pizzas were so thin, which thus turned the cheese a little rubbery as it got cold.   Service was excellent despite having a large number of people to serve.  Drinks were refilled fairly promptly, and pizzas were served promptly after everyone had arrived.  Since the pizza is thin, you can eat a ton of it before getting full.  I probably had twice the amount of pizza I normally would eat, both because of the tastiness of it and because of the actual pizza itself.    So, if you're in the area and craving pizza, Grimaldi's is an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"It was obvious 2 different people made our pizzas.. (the manager or hostess checked twice learning over to see if I had sausage on mine, there was so little in there in comparison to my daughters.. ) Took me 20 minutes to catch the manager/hostess she happened to be near us diming the lights. we were unable to get out waitresses attention whatsoever. She did come by immediately after the did was delivered to check. She was cheerful and nice, just never came back again. when we finally got the manager I told her I never got one refill of iced tea. We asking ed for boxes  to go frustrated at that point. She did ask to remake.. I was done by then.. Let me pay my check and leave. An attempt is made to get me to order dessert.. No thank you..My food to go please. $50 later for two people, one ice tea, 2 pizzas and a salad that I never got packed... She gave me 2 $5 of coupons to return... Bahhaha.... Nope! Passed them to my nephew at the next table. I'll stick with Nick & Bens Pizza! Far better, great price and fantastic service. On the way out I looked at the manager and said., \"By the way.. I never got my salad packed as asked\" (Was taking it home to enjoy with Ranch, dressing which is not an option at Grimaldis) Her comment \"It's no biggie\" ?!?! Hmmm, probably not the best thing to reply to a frustrated customer. I really expected better, beautiful atmosphere and restaurant. Pizza oven... They could be the place to enjoy often if not for the service. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped by here. One of the best pizzas I've had!   Although it was super packed, there was plenty of parking in the nearby lots. We also got seated right away. Service was also fast and friendly. Ambiance was cool but it was pretty loud.  The pizza was great! We had half a specialty pizza and half I created. I personally think the one I created was better lol   Highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Love Grimaldi's for pizza and salads in DC Ranch. The restaurant is open and airy, but also looks like a New York Pizzeria, and is right off the beautiful park there. You get to order custom combination toppings like sun dried tomato and pesto (my personal favorite) for their wood fired pizzas. The salads are really good too, especially the Mediterranean and Antipasti. Very attentive service and staff. All around good place for a family night out."}
{"text":"Thank you Costco for the gift cards. I LOVE Grimaldis. Great location for a restaurant. Not exactly my favorite layout for a restaurant, but when you taste the pizza you will not care. They have a bar that goes to outside and a patio which is nice. The servers have all always been really friendly. The service is always fast. They don't rather have a lot of choices for food here for people that may not like pizza, but as long as you do you are good to go. I usually will choose deep dish or Neapolitan pizza as my choices for go to pizza, but if you are feeling like NY style pizza it's either here or NYPD across the street. To me those are the best NY Style pizza places in AZ.  Grimaldis pizza really the best for this style. Every bite is so flavorful and addicting. It makes it difficult to stop eating it. It is a little pricey, but is completely worth it. I will continue to go back time and time again."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good, but I don't think I would name it the best. I went this evening (Friday night) and arrived slightly before the main dinner crowd. Quick seating and good service.   We had the small house salad, and it was good. Really, I don't like ordering or eating salad. Not my favorite thing. I always hear Pee Wee Herman in my head saying \"MMMM Salady\". But it was good as far as salads go.   We ordered the large pizza with mushroom and pepperoni. It's a thin crust pizza and was good for thin crust. Good tomato, basil and other herbs. The pizza itself was about $15. I thought the ingredients were maybe a touch pricey. Basically $2 per ingredient unless you ordered artichoke, red peppers or sun tried tomatoes - those were $4. The price could rise quickly depending on the toppings.   The flavor was good and I did put down 2 pieces, but the bottom was a bit too well done for me. The black bottom changed the overall flavor, but still good. I did enjoy the decor and small subway signs around the bar.  Comfortable atmosphere, good service and good pizza. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a really solid pizza place on the strip. It's not as convenient as some due to being located far in the Fashion Show mall, but it's worth it especially if you're already there shopping! We had the meatball and mozzarella pizza with ricotta added. It was fantastic! A large was more than enough for both of us. They also have a nice wine selection, and most wines are available in a decanter."}
{"text":"First time trying Grimaldi's, and it was phenomenal! DeVon was incredible!! One of the best servers we've ever had! Wonderful experience. The manager Gina Territo was also amazing & made us feel very welcomed. Definitely recommend it & try this location if it's your first time for a marvelous experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent atmosphere. Had the house salad (very tasty) and a pepperoni pizza with extra mozzarella. Sweet waitress was from Italy. Great meal; we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is so good. My favorite pizza is NY style: thin, crispy, and saucy. Grimaldi's does it right. Not only is the pizza great (and salads too!) but the staff is incredibly friendly. Went twice on our four day trip to Las Vegas and will most definitely frequent it again when we return to LV."}
{"text":"A bit in a corner in the palazzo but worth the walk.  Parking is super easy even for an out of towner  The small salads are good to share for two to three people.   We got 1 large mushroom ricotta. (Omg ricotta!!) and a medium pepperoni.  They use the small pepperoni that gets crunchy!! Heaven!! This fed all 5 of us.  It's so good we could have taken some home but kept eating Prices are fair and food comes quickly We were there at lunch on a Saturday so I can't say about speed at dinner.   But this place is a find for sure!"}
{"text":"Asked for ranch with my salad and waiter said they don't serve it and mentioned that he gets complaints about not having ranch all the time. Hello management: get ranch.  Overall the food was good but overpriced. But I guess people are willing to pay more for the atmosphere which fun and lively. I liked how you can view your pizza being made.  I'd go again though but I'll bring a bottle of ranch in my purse."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is the real deal.  My wife and I tried to go to the one in Brooklyn but got there too early and didn't want to wait so we weren't able to try it until we went to their restaurant in Vegas.  We had high expectations and it did not disappoint.  It is hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had.  I heard they have some locations in California that I'm going to try and the next time we go to Vegas, we are going back.  We are big fans of Grimaldi's and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ! Coal baked pizza has the perfect crust. Sauce to die for. Gramaldis is reminiscent of being back east."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Very, very thin crust. Probably the thinnest I've ever had, but I do like it that way. Service was fast, prompt and we were checked in on a lot. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza!  Even more so when its free!!    Just sign up for the Grimaldi's Newsletter.  Right before your birthday, you'll receive an email for a free large pizza!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The pizza is amazing and so is the staff. Great atmosphere with no crazy party boys and girls from the Strip. I missed the chance to go to Grimaldi's when I was in Brooklyn, but thank god I found it in Vegas. The pizza is simple and tasty. Our waiter, Alex, was fantastic as we chatted him up a bit about the city.   Our favorite: The pepperoni pizza with fresh tomatoes and mushrooms. Friggin' awesome. Not too greasy, not overly salty. The crust had a nice crunch but still foldable. The sauce was just right - it accentuated the ingredients but still had a nice flavor on its own.  Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible it's like eating card board with cheese sprinkled on it! The use more cheese on 1/4 of 1 ppiece of a Chicago deep dish pizza slice at Rossati's than 2 whole pizza at this joint. Thank Giardonna's is coming to the Strip!"}
{"text":"Gahhhhhhh Grimaldi's!  I printed out a birthday coupon for a free 18'' pizza and we went on a family dinner date. Awesome experience! Terrific, high-energy server who recommended the grilled chicken Caesar salad. Devoured appetizer. Our pizza of choice was the meatball cheese pizza and what an excellent choice! The meatballs alone were very flavorful and should be offered as an appetizer alone because they pair famously with the tomato sauce and cheese. Mmmmmmmm. Grimaldi's keeps it so simple and the menu reflects that, what they are best at is Pizza. Salads, bruschetta, cheese boards are all just a compliment of the amazing entree course."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a great option for thin crust-style pizza. It has a nice little outdoor area, and everything there is fresh, from the crust, to the sauce, to the cheese, and desserts. You can watch them make the pizzas inside the restaurant. The service is good, but this good food takes time! Don't go in a hurry, and don't get it to-go, because the crust will be soggy by the time it gets home."}
{"text":"We started with a small salad that was big enough to split between 3 adults and the vinegarate dressing was good. We ordered an 18 inch Don pizza and added onions. It was delicious! Great cheese, sauce and toppings and the best crust! Our waitress was nice and the restaurant is very nice and clean. We ended with a banana cream cheesecake and carmel coconut cheesecake, both were delicious! I live in Iowa but every time I visit AZ I always have to come here for pizza!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza joint.  I had the \"pizza of the month,\" which happened to be the BBQ chicken.  It was good, but I felt like it didn't really showcase the type of pizza that would benefit from the Grimaldi's style.  As we were leaving, I saw the pizza a couple had ordered - pepperoni with extra sauce - and it looked amazing.  I will definitely return and order a pizza that is a little less \"busy.\"  That way, I can really enjoy the buffalo mozzarella that they use."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's was alright. We ordered two large pizzas, a garden and a pepperoni, it was it $50. I didn't think that was a bad price until we took our pizza home and started eating. The crust is thin and burnt and the pizza is floppy. Definitely wasn't worth the price of $50. The pizza itself wasn't bad it was tasty but the quality just wasn't there. Just feel like if one large pizza is over $20 it should have the perfect thickness, doughynes and crunch."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite pizza restaurant in all of Phoenix and Yes I've eaten at Federal, Bianca's, Pomo and others across the city.  They are good no doubt but something special about Grimaldi's is their toppings.  In particular, their ricotta.  I have no idea how they do it, it's mesmerizing!  It's smooth, it has a sweet nutty flavor and it is perfect.  We've been multiple times with friends and have gotten them to catch the ricotta bug as well.  Last time in there our table ordered 4 pizzas All with added ricotta and when the manager helped deliver them he remarked on this must be the table that loves ricotta.  Yes we do!!  I'm addicted to their ricotta especially on the Don.  Bellissimo.     Their salads are great as well.  Have never had dessert but maybe someday I'll try (if I can add ricotta) :p"}
{"text":"If you want a great pizza this place is the best! Love everything about them. The salads are good too. Make sure to sign up for the birthday club, you'll get a free pizza for your birthday month each year! We look forward to it!"}
{"text":"This is really one of the best pizza chains in town! Their menu is pretty small and simple, but the few things they make are awesome!!! Their portions are pretty big, my bf and I usually share a small salad and a personal size pizza and it's more than enough! Their crust is soo good, they wood fire it and it's truly just perfect! Oh I forgot, the best part is their large selection of international beers!"}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience last night. Had made a reservation and was seated right away. Had a nice bottle of wine a great salad and a super pizza. Joined there birthday club and will be back."}
{"text":"Truly disappointing experience. Last Friday (September 15th) was my birthday. Several friends and coworkers (total it was 11 people) planned a dinner at Grimaldi's and a comedy show to follow. Thursday afternoon a coworker called to make reservations. The hostess told her that they couldn't take our reservation, but told her that since we were planning on an early dinner (5:30) we shouldn't have a problem finding seating. First red flag considering we've made multiple reservations in the past without a problem. What the hostess neglected to inform her of was that the manager only allows larger parties to sit together outside. Again in the past, we've never had to sit outside before due to our party size. Um what?! My coworker arrived first, asked to speak to a manager (who was extremely rude) who still refused to push tables together inside. It was 103° outside and we were refused seating accommodations in a then empty restaurant. The manager said that \"larger tables sit for too long\" and thus aren't allowed to sit inside the restaurant. My coworker then explained we had a 7:00 show to go to which would make his argument invalid and he still refused. For someone who is running a SERVICE business, he was certainly lacking in courtesy and accommodation. The only reason this review gets two stars is because of our amazing server (the bartender of the night-- I regret that I didn't get his name) who gladly let us take up three separate tables (because the manager again, rudely informed us that while we could all sit there were could not move the tables together despite his bartenders willingness) and because the food and wine was still great despite the bad taste the manager gave us."}
{"text":"Solid pies, my friends. The Brooklyn Bridge is my fave. Awesome patio, too.  Good beer selection, and if you're a wine novice they even upsell, er, suggest, favorable pairings. Go for it, wine and pizza is a good combo (or beer and pizza, or pizza and pizza)."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the Greek pizza, spinach and cheese all over YUM! Recently eaten at the New York original Grimaldi's and I want to say the food is the same here! Usually when eateries open from coast to coast somehow the ingredients change, not Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 24/100  One thing to love about Grimaldi's Pizzeria is their birthday special - a free large pizza with one free topping,  After hiking up at Red Rock last Sunday, a group of us came here famished and ready to indulge! First thing that caught my eyes were the wine bottle chandeliers, propped without their base, cap traded in for a light-bulb. They absolutely complimented the 'old town' feel of the restaurant.   We went on to order a large caesar's salad (dressing on the side), and a pizza (that came with mozarella), basil and italian sausage. Crust was thin and crispy and meat was juicy. Salad wasn't out of this world, but scrumptious nonetheless (especially after our hike!) What sparkled things (and eventually raised the rating to a 4 from what I believe should've been a 3.5) was the limited $5 Thin Mint Cookie Cheesecake made with girl scout cookies! Oh boy were they fine! Four of us shared it if I'm not mistaken, that cake slice was gone in less than minutes!  If you're up for a free pizza too, ask for an application card, fill it out and wait for their email offer a week before your birthday!"}
{"text":"I am always skeptical when it come to a franchise from the original restaurant. For example, Uno Pizza in Chicago is Awesome but the franchise ones do not even taste close to the original Unos. I have been the the Grimaldis Brooklyn Bridge location (the old original was in Manhattan) and waited the long line and the pizza was great. As a thin crust pizza fan, I can say this Grimaldis was excellent and damn close to the original in NY (maybe they just need the NYC water?). The pizza was probably the best I have had in a long time and I have eaten at a ton of local joints (FYI...I hate the chain pizza restaurants or take out). I recommend this place and get the homemade cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Yelped and reviewed before our Vegas trip ( we love pizza ), and cannot say enough about this incredible pizza...service...ATMOSPHERE! We will be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has a hilarious sense of humor when it comes to portion sizes - and I like it!   First of all, those salads are minimum two person salads unless that's all you are eating. My table was myself and six hungry guys and we got three salads - half of one was left when all was said and done. My favorite was the Caprese with fresh mozzarella.   You pick your own toppings so I made myself the equivalent of a margherita pizza. Scrumptiousssssssssnesss. The personal is definitely for at least 2 people (thus the humor of the portion sizes). All the toppings were fresh, the crust was thin and crunchy - basically a great pizza all around.   Service was great with our big, very undecided party - seriously, none of us could decide anything. Our server was very patient and helpful in narrowing our decisions.   Next time I'm here for work, I'm coming here for pizza!"}
{"text":"I cannot wait to go back to Vegas and eat this pizza again. It was nice as they were open later then other places so we could come here and eat. Its just so good I crave it which sucks because I don't even live in Vegas. Its almost worth the flight just to get the pizza!"}
{"text":"GET THE LARGE PEPPERONI & MUSHROOM WITH DOUBLE MOZZARELLA, you will want left-overs !   Tucked in between Kona Grill and Gordon Bierch is the pizzeria that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous and now you can experience EXCELLENT NY pizza here on the West Coast without waiting in a long ass line with tons of tourists on Old Fulton Street.  Just park in the strip mall and head towards the fountain and you will find one of the greatest pizzerias in Summerlin (the other one is Rocco's by Costco).  I'm born & raised NY and my taste buds have been in training all my life, I know Great Pizza.  This thin crust is cracker crisp and will stay perfectly horizontal even without folding.  Here is what separates the Grimaldi style from others:  1. They place fresh HANDMADE mozzarella slices (not shredded) on the crust FIRST 2. Sauce is drizzled on top after the toppings (white pizza does not even have sauce) 3. Oven temperature is HOTTER than hell which can soar up to 1200 degrees.  This coal oven brick pizza gives the crust that distinct charred flavor and crispiness.  Look under the crust and you will see the color that's different.   4. Pepperoni are little tiny salty slices which crisp up a bit.  SOOO GOOOD 5. When you have been in the pizza business this long, you know that there are key factors that people connotate with excellent pizza: New York style, NY water, sauce, cheese, oven temperature, etc.  Grimaldi re-creates the NY style of water by re-creating the exact mineral content of Brooklyn water to make sure the dough is just like NY.  The coal brick oven is a goldmine and permit nightmare in NYC.  It wasn't possible to install a coal brick oven in Manhattan where Grimaldi originally wanted to open his pizzeria, so he opened up in Brooklyn (coal ovens had to be grandfathered in from the building).  Under the bridge on Old Fulton Street is famous, but now with the latest lease controversy, there is the new location around the corner from the original.  Back in 1904 Lombardi opened a brick oven pizza in SOHO and you can also wait in line to compare.  In March 2012, Juliana's will be opening up in NY as another Grimaldi spin off."}
{"text":"Good pizza. I came with hubby for a quick bite. Their small was big and the salad was good. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"This was my first experience here.  We were seated inside and it was LOUD.  This made for a difficult time with my little girl.   The service was average and the food was over priced. That being said, their salads are pretty good and the pizza is also pretty good... not the best I've had but pretty good.  It does have a cool feel to the place if the sound was better managed but all in all I wasn't really impressed.   It was fun to get out though."}
{"text":"Pizza ok Servers dying grab my plate The second the last bite one in the mouth.  The place was empty so why the big rush?  I usually tip 25-30% so u blew by rushing my meal   Won't be back"}
{"text":"delicious pizza, the menu is big the service is good and the pizza is awesome. they have a great wine list, the pizza is a little on the pricey side but its worth it. the only problem is the location, its tucked in the corner of the plaza and on Eastern so its a pain to get in and out of."}
{"text":"Pizza and salad here are amazing!!  Usually always busy so make sure to use the app to schedule your coming ahead of time."}
{"text":"I still prefer deep dish pies, but Grimaldi's definitely makes it tough to hold steady on that position.  Best recommendation I can give you is that the day after pizza was almost as delicious as the day of pizza."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Nice patio and indoor seating. The waitress was very pleasant and thoroughly explained the menu. Ordered a small Caesar salad and it was more than enough to serve two. I would've added a bit more dressing and preferred buttered seasoned croutons instead the toasted bread cubes, but it was good. My friends pizza came out a good four minutes before my pizza arrived, even though we ordered at the same time and my pizza had less toppings. The pizzas were good, fresh ingredients. They only offer thin crust, which I prefer, but not for everyone. I liked the very fresh whole milk mozzarella, it melts so much better and adds that string cheesy pull. The personal size pizza that we ordered was more than enough for two to share. It's a cool place to hang out and good for a date night"}
{"text":"OMG - there pizza is sooo good! They have no pre-set pizza options, you completely choose the toppings yourself. A little on the pricey side but totally worth it. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They definitely continue the great tradition of a good thin crust pizza here. I am very sad that there aren't any in Cali!!   Ended up getting the Layer Cake Primitivo pairing. The sausage and the zin are lovely together. The wine wasn't too dry, and the pizza was crispy yet soft all at the same time. We also got the antipasto platter to start, which was a nice plate of meats and cheeses. The olives were *really* tart though, I usually love 'em but even I couldn't take the pucker.  Also did not get any bubbled up cheese/crust on our pie. Doesn't take anything away, but there's nothing like a huge bubble of cheese on your slice."}
{"text":"We've been going to this Grimaldis Restaurant pretty much since it first opened. If you enjoy thin crust coal brick oven pizza you will love this pizza.   The menu is pretty simple, they offer pizza and salad and a few basic appetizers, that's it. You really only have the option of ordering pizza here. Great for us, not the place to go if you are looking for anything else. They offer 3 sizes of pizza - personal (plenty for 2 adults), medium and large. The base prices are $14, $16, $18 and each topping that you add runs about $2 each. Three great things about this pizza - the crust, the sauce and the cheese. The cheese is excellent,fresh mozzarella is wonderful. I love coffee and the coffee is great here too.   They don't have a kids menu but Grimaldis is kid friendly. My kids love to go here specifically because they get to play with pizza dough while they are waiting for the food the come out. I have noticed that not all servers automatically bring this out but once we ask, they always do. The kids have a lot of fun with the dough!   Grimaldis is usually busy at peak times and there's usually a wait of 10-20 minutes.   Highly recommend Grimaldis."}
{"text":"Pizza was expensive, but delicious. We got meatball with extra mozzarella. The meatballs were plentiful, but not the best I ever had. Next time I'll try sausage instead. I ordered takeout, and honestly don't think I would eat in unless it was at the bar. The restaurant is small with a bunch of tables packed tightly together. I'm not really into eating closely with strangers. The bar looked promising enough to have a drink with a friend or dinner. I honestly would give them 3 1/2 stars, but that's not an option, so I round up to 4 because it definitely was not a 3....."}
{"text":"this review is just on the food because we go it to go. They have a drive-through door for to go orders. We had a white sauce pizza with mushrooms, sausage and bacon. My favorite pizza anywhere is the Margherita. I love the fresh basil and tomato. Will have to go back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza. Cant go wrong with any of the choices on the menu. Location is great too - in the Venetian.  Worth going back again."}
{"text":"This location has really good service and the pizza is amazing.  I love Grimaldi's pizza, it's delicious.  We've been going to this location for many years and it hasn't disappointed once.  We will definitely be going back again.  They have really good tiramisu too."}
{"text":"I love their pizza, the half white pizza with half pepperoni is my fav!  This has become my new favorite pizza place"}
{"text":"First experience at Grimaldi's and the waitress was terrible we were here for it seemed the whole night like a couple hours. The pizza was good. Thin crust style burnt crispy crust. If it were not for the service it was overall an ok experience. The pizza wasn't that that good and not good enough to make it worth my money to come back. I also didn't like that toppings were a la carte. The pizza is well overpriced with a large cheese being 16. Toppings being 2 to 4 per topping. So no for pizza instead of a fine dining 5 course meal and wine 5 hour dining definitely not worth my time. The only positive about the waitress was she filled my water. I'm done and out!"}
{"text":"The pizza is always good there. My second favorite pizza place in Arizona. I have been to multiple Grimaldi's here in Arizona and the food is consistently good at every location I have been to! I get the 16 inch pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and bacon! Sometimes I will get \"The Don\" if I want to change it up!"}
{"text":"Listen, this place could have the worst service, horrible atmosphere and ridiculous prices and I'd still come here. And the answers yes, there pizza is just that good. But here's the bonus; there's great service and a nice italian diner atmosphere. Located conveniently next to a Harkins Theatre it's a wonderful date location as well. As long as they don't tweak that wonderful pizza this Italian isn't going to change his opinion(Fact, it's a FACT that there pizza is delicious ;)"}
{"text":"Where I work, people have recommended Grimaldi's Pizza. Given the opportunity, I tried their relatively new Fashion Show Mall location during our staycation.   Grimaldi' s obviously has fans. At 2 p.m., there was a ten minute wait. And they are putting up a new Grimaldi's caddy corner across Las Vegas Boulevard in the Pallazo.   With a fashion show taking place, in the vicinity of Gramaldi's, the wait was not boring. When the tables are all occupied, they hand you a beeper resembling a pizza slice. When a table is available, it goes off.   I enjoyed my personal thin crusted pizza topped with mushrooms. It seemed to be the equivalent of four slices of standard pizza. The taste and quality are commendable.   The negative is they do not sell individual slices of thick crusted pizza. New York pizza that I grew up on.   The people that recommended Grimaldi's were right. I am a fan."}
{"text":"Last night, on my last review I shared my experience at a pizzeria that was ordinary at best. For this review I will leave Paris for Italy to share a pizzeria that makes me say, \"wow!\" Being this is the Las Vegas Strip, the distance from Paris to Italy is less than a mile.       Grimaldi's is a pizzeria chain that started in New York City. There original location is off Fulton Street under the Brooklyn Bridge (this place fits would fit in at NY-NY). Grimaldi's became so popular that it spread to different parts of the country. There are a few locations in Las Vegas. The neat thing about Grimaldi's is that their two locations on the Las Vegas Strip (the other one is in Fashion Show) are identical to the off-strip locations. Disparate from certain restaurants, Grimaldi's has stayed off the price - gouging bandwagon. Another neat thing is that I personally visited the original location. Well kind of. On the way to Atlantic City, my friend pulled up to Grimaldi's and took out a pie that was delicious road food on the drive. A few other times, he'd take out Grimaldi's. The fact that he lived in the middle of Long Island, a landscape where the pizzeria is the equivalent of the poker lounge in Vegas, and stopped at Grimaldi's when he was in the City is evidence that Grimaldi's is first-rate pizzeria. From these experiences, I attest to the fact that Grimaldi's is legitimate New York pizza instead of a pizzeria pretending to be.      Practically across the continent and a long ride across Interstate 15 and 80 to the George Washington Bridge this Grimaldi's sits in the shadow of canals, gondola boats, and St. Mark's Square. Just like the Brooklyn Bridge, this makes for an exciting spot to enjoy New York pizza that melts in your mouth and not in your hands.      The restaurant itself is impressive. It is a large space on the upper floor of the Palazzo Shops a coin throw from the pedestrian bridge leading to the Wynn. The upscale environment is a relaxing location to bite into New York pizza while listening to a soundtrack including Frank Sinatra. The impressive dining space extends from a patio overlooking the Palazzo Shops to Las Vegas Boulevard. There are several tables with red and white table cloths plus a bar underneath the dimly lit pizzeria. Many of the tables offer a unique Vista of the colossal chandelier hanging from the Palazzo Shops ceiling forming a wall at the restaurant elevation. Talk about elegance. Now I will talk about the pizza.       I respect Grimaldi's for having the decency to pass over taking advantage of being on the Las Vegas Strip. The prices are commendable. A small New York pizza pie featuring the coal oven cooked thin crust, melting mozzarella cheese, and out of this world Grimaldi's sauce is $9 before toppings. The menu offers a sundry of toppings including meatballs, pepperoni, bacon, and other choices. I cherish my pizza pie with mushrooms. The mushrooms, in similar style to numerous toppings adds $2 to the experience. And what an experience! Prior to the pizza pie, bread and butter is a tasty oman to meal ahead. With the pizza pie, I order a soda. After tip and tax, it comes out to less than $20 well spent.      At Grimaldi's, the staff is just like the pizza: pleasant. The servers have always been attentive and friendly. One of the servers I had for a few visits was extraordinary friendly. I remember asking him if they are opening anymore Grimaldi's. He enthusiastically said that they want to build one in northwest Las Vegas. That was a couple of years ago and has yet to happen. What does happen is that you feel appreciated here.      This review is a word picture that tells a true story that there is usually a Happy Ending dining at the Palazzo Grimaldi's. This positive word picture is one of the positive Grimaldi's accolades. The Food Network rated it as one of the five best pizzerias in the United States. Ziglats rated it as the best pizzeria in New York City. I will finish painting this word picture by saying that I recommend Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"In the shadow of Boca Park, I enjoyed the Grimaldi's personal pizza as much as I enjoyed eating it in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge (not the one in front of New York-New York). Grimaldi's is not brick oven pizza. It is COAL BRICK OVEN PIZZA that is DELICIOUS.      This Grimaldi's looks similar to the majority of their restaurants that I have had the pleasure to dine in. Before we walked in the door, the hostess welcomed us. She seated us in the middle. To the back was the open kitchen where they made the coal brick oven pizza. To the right was a hall with the restrooms.  To the left was a bar. Throughout the restaurant were pictures of New York. Above was soft lighting which made for a relaxing supper.    I ordered a personal pizza ($9). When you dine with other people, the personal pizza is the way to go. It is thin crusted with a portion that will fill you up, and your company will not be thinking badly of you for taking one slice too many. If I had been more hungry I would of paid more for a mushroom topping. The bottomless cola had zero flatness issues. The dinner was supposed to come with house bread. They forgot about it, which is not the end of the world.    With Grimaldi's major growth, it is easy to return to a Grimaldi's. To me this is a good thing."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Grimaldi's. When I lived in Long Island, NY we'd make a stop off at the original New York City location in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge when we drove into New Jersey. After Grimaldi's  followed me to Las Vegas, I have been reliving the pizza that has been part of my New York heritage. Today, when we stumbled upon the Scottsdale Square location, the decision was made where we were eating.     Our first impression was that the service was good. Approaching Grimaldi's, the hostess opened the door and gave us a friendly welcome. Throughout the meal the waiter was courteous and on top of cola refills.    A 3,000 mile distance from the original New York City Grimaldi's has had relatively zero impact on the taste of the thin crusted pizza at this location. Grimaldi's is doing a commendable job passing their recipe to locations that have spread from New York City toward the West Coast.     The price is fair. I ordered a personal pizza with mushrooms that included house bread and bottomless soda. With a tip, it came to $17.     Grimaldi's is an example of a restaurant that has grown from one location into a national chain without sacrificing the quality of the original location that made them popular. And so, I also bestow this Grimaldi's with a four star rating."}
{"text":"This place does some real business, but even coming over on a Saturday night at about 6 during Spring Training, the wait was only about 25 minutes.  I call that quite acceptable.  The decor is what one might call \"pizza place.\"  It looks like a pizza place and it smells like a pizza place.    Pizza is just about all Grimaldi's does.  The menu is pretty bare bones.  They have a few blank pizzas (red sauce, garlic sauce, etc) and several toppings ranging from $2 to $4 a piece.  There are no premade pizzas, so you have to design your own, and if you're wanting a behemoth 5 topping pizza, your bill will add up quickly.  We had sausage, sweet peppers, and mushrooms, and it was an excellent combination.  The sweet peppers are almost meaty in texture.  The pizza is very lightly sauced and comes thin crust only.  They also have a few salads, served family style.  We just had a small house salad between the two of us starving fatties, and it was a good portion, especially for only $5.  Pretty standard stuff, but a nice way to start the meal nonetheless.  The service was very good the whole night.  The waitress took ownership of the place, which I always like (\"You've never been here before?  Great.  I have three basic types of pizza... I have all these toppings,\" etc).  We had a really cool table right next to the kitchen so I got to see a lot of pizzas being made, and I have to say, people really friggin like pepperoni.  Branch out and try something new!  The pizza was good, but the thin crust got soggy as it sat, and it didn't absolutely blow me away.  That and the limited menu, which I didn't personally mind but I would warn people about, knock it down a star.  But I'd still recommend the place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints! I love that they have patio seating available. I always start off with bruschetta trio with tomato & basil, artichoke, and olive medley. You get two of each flavor! They have five different salads but they do go a little light on the dressing, so I always get an extra side. I like that they have both small and large salads for all of them. As for pizza my go to is the white garlic. One of my favorite things about Grimaldi's is the $6 TIRAMISU!!!!! I totally recommend checking this place out if you are in the mood for some real NY style pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and house salad.  Small house salad is big enough for 3 or 4 people to share.  We ate here twice in Vegas, both times at the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Excellent dining choice. Love that they text you a link to the wait list so if you're walking about, you can check in on your place on the list. We were a larger party of 8 and they did a great job seating and serving us. The pizza was AMAZING. And the salads are HUGE! A small easily fed 2-3 and the large was enough for 4-5. Lovely family meal."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. There is just something about the tasty pepperonis they have on their pizzas that are just out of this world! Love it and love coming here. They are a tad on the expensive side but i will always come back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I think they have one of the best pepperoni pizza around. Very flavorful and spot on great pizza!"}
{"text":"Ok I know I need to lose weight but I didn't pick where we held the event this week. My good friend Chris Lutter selected the location because he has done several events at Grimaldis and it's always good. I don't usually eat before a presentation but I was last on the agenda so I sat at a small table in the back and before you know it there is a large super thin and crispy pizza sitting right in front of me. The smell was just too much! What's a fat man to do? When I picked up my first piece by the end crust it never drooped down. The crispiest pizza ever.  It brought back food memory's from my pizza I had in Florence Italy. If you want extraordinary pizza seek this place out because it's worth the trip. Even from California! I don't know about any of their other food but the Pizza is absolutely the best. I nearly ate the whole thing before my presentation. I could hardly move but it was worth every bite!!! Check out Grimaldis it's the very best. Thanks Lutter!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Best pizza you can get. Crust is not too thick. Reminds me of NY!  House chianti is a good price. Fun to go before the movies. My daughter took us for the first time in Nevada. Glad there is one here."}
{"text":"Great pizza, good bears on tap. This has been my best good experience on the strip this trip to Vegas. Grimaldi' S was well above average food, and great service just one slightly cleaner restroom from 5 star. I would definitely recommend them for pizza on the strip."}
{"text":"Yummy!   I love NY style pizza. I love Costco pizza. I love deep dish pizza. I just love pizza in general, and I was craving it. This was just great timing, since it was on the way back to the car.  Got a large pesto pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. So delicious! It fed three people comfortably, but I think we should've ordered a large salad to split as well. Portions are HUGE. If you really wanted, the small salad is big enough to be a meal in itself. I just wanted more pizza since it was so delicious my stomach didn't know if it was full or not.   Service is a little on the slow side, but I notice that they make each pizza to order, so most of the wait time is definitely because of cooking. You will never see your order sitting on the counter."}
{"text":"There is NOTHING about this place that I didn't LOVE. Really I don't want to eat pizza anywhere else again.  Our waitress recommended and incredible wine- that of course I can't remember the name of. A red blend- Tamas maybe?  She also recommended the pizza we ordered. Red sauce, italian sausage, ricotta cheese & roasted red bell peppers. Heaven, no kidding.  And to think that I have never had a glassy of wine with my pizze before- my life was changed FOREVER!.  We started with the antipasto- while simple was divine, perfect combo of all things delicious!  Random fact: in the kitchen they have a chemist come in and match the pH and mineral content of the water to the water in new york- so that the food they make tasted the same. Who knew?  Finished off the meal with a slice of Bailey's and Cream cheesecake (also made fresh in the Grimaldi's kitchen).... to die for.  Thanks for changing my life :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Customer service was outstanding. Danika was fabulous. She stayed patient when we took forever to make up our minds. The product was worth the money and the value of the food was amazing as well."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Scottsdale, solid everytime. A bigger draft beer list gets it a five star, thats just me being a beer snob, they do well for a pizza place to have so many."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Grimaldi's since I moved here two years ago, but just finally got to check it out this week when I was doing a little shopping in Fashion Show Mall.  As a big fan of New York style pizza, I was super excited to try the place that everyone has told me is a \"must have.\"  ....\"Must have forgotten the flavor\" is more like it.  We ordered a pie with spicy chicken sausage, black olives, and mushrooms, and a Mediterranean salad with grilled chicken.  The pizza was insanely bland.  The sauce was really lacking in flavor, spice, and salt and moreover, the whole thing just kind of tasted like bread, to be honest.  Here's what they did RIGHT: the crust (although the flavor was just okay) was the PERFECT amount of crunchy.   It was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and had the structural integrity to hold up the toppings.  The spicy chicken sausage and my salad were both good, but it didn't compensate for the overall lack of flavor in the pizza.  My advice?  Go to Secret Pizza in the Cosmo.  Best NY style pizza in Vegas, without a doubt."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  The bottom of our pizza was very black. First time going there. Grew up having NYC pizza and my parents owned a very popular italian restaurant in vegas. I know my pizza"}
{"text":"Great pizza (for a New York style) and great service.  The prices were also very reasonable.  Definitely somewhere to try if you are wanting to eat pizza while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is ok.  They do nickel and dime you like crazy.  Seems very calculated to drive up the bill. 1 large pizza (no toppings) and calzone was $47. We asked for extra sauce. $2 for each Dixie cup size container, which they fill only half full."}
{"text":"How hard is it to mark your hours to indicate you shut down your pizza oven for two hours?  Open from 11-til midnight... (Except when we shut down the ovens in the afternoon) Thanks for wasting my time I wasted an afternoon walking the strip to come here"}
{"text":"I hate that when I visit Scottsdale, I have two pizza places I HAVE to go to in a mile radius - Oregano's and here  I went to the original in Brooklyn, and I must say I am very impressed with how similar the pizza is in AZ and Brooklyn - you wouldn't expect a chain to expand that far west and retain its qualities.   Great pizza, great salad, awesome restaurant - see you in March!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good.... but hello Cheesecake. Just the plain cheesecake is so delish! I never order desserts but swear I could never go there and not order the cheesecake at the end... It is the best!"}
{"text":"I've been to the original and this is not the same-but close enough to warrant 4 stars in the middle of the nonsense of Las Vegas.  Service is less pretentious than most places on The Strip.  Salad was good and the wine very inexpensive.  Would I go back?  Tonight."}
{"text":"I work for Pandora and my boss ordered 3 pies today for our store.  When I went to pick them up I spoke to Toni the manager who did not have our order.  I told her what my boss ordered and Toni explained to me that the bartender who took the order did not place it correctly and the pizzas were sold to other customers.  She then told me she would make them on the house and deliver them to my store.  Toni was gracious and apologetic and the pizza was well worth the wait.  She is all that a manager should be: she explained what happened and made sure to follow up with her staff and to get my order perfect and timely.  My boss and I are both very impressed with Toni and her management skills.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"first impressions were definitely cool, calm and collective. good vibes and a great atmosphere.  the pinot noir wine was very smooth bodied and full flavored. visiting from Sierra Vista I never heard of this place. Pizza is great! I recommend all to try it."}
{"text":"Make sure to add salt to your pizza, sounds crazy, but it needs it trust me! Andrea the bar tender is awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love this little pizza joint they have a wood burning oven and the pizza is cooked perfectly crunchy crust with cheese and tomatoes and basil is very good and the price was even better $10 for pizza and a soda and a salad delicious"}
{"text":"What can I say about Grimaldi's, but great pizza and good wine! I get the usual, which is the name we keep trying to get them to put on the menu (only because it's what I get every time). It's simple and delicious! Oh yeah... It's a regular cheese pizza with tomato sauce AND pesto sauce. If you are looking for a tasty, old fashioned slice, it's the way to go. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I came here with a huge party of about 20 and was seated outside. It was a nice and warm night too, which was great.   We ordered several salads which were good. But the pizzas were the best. The pizzas were not too thin and was so flavorful. I loved the crispiness of the crust as well."}
{"text":"First time trying grimaldis. I did a take out order and ordered am 18 inch brooklyn bridge pizza with green peppers. The brooklyn bridge has creamy ricotta, sweet red peppers and italian sausage. I added the green peppers.  The crust was thin which i loved. The pizza overall was delicious. The ricotta on the pizza made it so much more tastier. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I are pizza lovers, and we have different pizza restaurants depending on the kind of pizza mood we are in. Seriously, we're into pizza.   We go to Grimaldi's when we want a traditional pie. Every time we've come here, we've had a great meal. We usually get a salad, wine, and then split a large pizza. I am not ashamed to say that the two of us polish off the entire thing. The wine list isn't anything to write home about, but wine isn't the reason we come, anyway.   We prefer to sit in one of the booths in the front of the restaurant, facing the bar, because it feels more intimate there than in the larger dining area, which is usually crowded.   We've always had attentive and helpful servers, and we love the decor inside. It just feels like a neighborhood pizza joint.  We usually come for lunch on the weekends, and we've never had to wait for a table--however, it gets super-crowded for dinner on Friday nights, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizza is mouthwatering and amazing. I was very pleased with the exceptional table service by the wait staff. They would go above and beyond and even opened and closed the door when I stepped outside for a quick call.  If you want a delicious pizza, don't forget to add fresh basil. Makes a world of difference. Basil up your pizza no matter what combination of toppings you choose..."}
{"text":"I consider myself a bit of a pizza snob. I've had a lot of pizza over the years and have become very biased. When I first visited Grimaldi's I read the reviews here on Yelp and I'm like yeah, right, whatever. This review covers 3 visits. And all 3 experiences were consistent in being excellent each time. Service is impeccable. The decor is nice. But who cares about that. They have a coal fired oven, and they dang sure know how to use it. Each pizza I've had came out with these little faint, whispery smoke trails on the crust from that oven, and that crust was so good I didn't leave any of it behind. Not once. The toppings are fresh, flavorful, and good. When the pizzas came out they looked like works of art, literally the visual appeal and then the aroma delights the senses. But a couple of bites in and you will understand...  Pricey? You bet. Worth it? In my opinion absolutely yes. Will I go back? Without a doubt. Is it the best pizza in Las Vegas? Settebello gives them competition, and I've got more exploring to do but so far from what I've found Grimaldi's is going to be hard to beat. It's worth the time to seek this place out. Don't let the upscale strip mall location scare off you out of towners.this is worthy of taking a cab ride off the strip to check out. 5 Stars...Earned and given without any hesitation."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had. Period.  Here is a suggestion. Order the 12 inch pizza. I had 4 toppings and every bite had a crispy bottom."}
{"text":"Although, Grimaldi's clearly does not need my review, they are gonna get it anyway!   We were vacationing in Fountain Hills with another family and my friend (from New Jersey) really wanted to try and find some authentic NY pizza. My husband requires the \"slice must fold in half to eat it\" model - we were told to go to Grimaldi's.   9 of us descended on the DC Ranch outpost on a Saturday night without a reservation (No, we are not crazy...close though) - we were seated on the heated back patio in under 30mins. Little did we know that Heaven awaited is after we ordered!!   We ordered 3 large pies - Traditional cheese, Sausage and Mushroom, and a White pie with the garlic olive oil base. OMFG!! This is simply, hands down, the BEST PIZZA I have ever eaten. The 3 pies, 3 family size salads were gone in under 10mins. The 5 teenagers were trying to convince is to order a couple more to take back to the house.   Can I also mention that the tab for dinner, with beverages (beer and wine for the 4 adults, sodas for the kids), salads and 3 large pizza's was just over $100 - for 9 people!!!  I am planning our next vacation just so we can get back here and get more goodness!!!"}
{"text":"I love the Boca Park location.  We always get a great server who's friendly and attentive: we don't sit with dirty plates in front of us or empty drinks, etc. I love the food.  The pepperoni pizza is my favorite, and the white pizza with garlic is good too. When I'm craving a tasty salad, this is one of the first places I think of.  My favorite is the Mediterranean with extra feta. Their cheesecake is also suuuuuuuper good.  They have seasonal flavors and plain and it's so delicious.  This location is right next door to a Cheesecake Factory and I'd pick Grimaldi's first any day. It's made on site and it's never frozen.  Prices are really reasonable for the quality of service and food that you're getting. I've always had a good experience with Grimaldi's, whether I've dined in or called in an order and picked it up."}
{"text":"Excellent tasting pizza. Big 18 inch large pie. Crust was perfect. Also ordered large salad, which fed family of 4 with left over portions. Ordered as takeout. Picked up at bar. Bartenders were friendly and very polite. Price extremely reasonable given this place is in the palazzo, amidst expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"We have dined at Grimaldi's twice before and were always impressed by the toppings, but also disappointed with the crust.  This time we chose the chose the white pizza with garlic and added fresh tomatoes.  They got it right this time."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 and wanted a low key place for dinner on 12/22.  I came earlier and made reservations for 6pm.  It was pretty empty.  Service was good.  But the pizzas do take some time (so you can't really be in a rush).   Pluses Salad was good (kale and ceasar) and were a good portion The white pizza was a hit with the kids.  The Biggest one is a good size, but the crust is thin so the kids ate a lot and we had to order more. the kids enjoyed playing with the dough in the beginning.  Kept them entertained for a bit.  Bad Did take a while to get the xtra pizza out  Great place for a casual meal.  I would opt to order and eat in the room next time."}
{"text":"Did a phone order - pepperoni pizza. It was really good! Very unique with the fresh mozzerella. The crust is thin and tasty. What was really cool is they brought it out to the car, we didn't have to go in! Service was good and friendly. Will definately be back to try a sit down meal."}
{"text":"I have been a Grimaldi's fan since I discovered it in Dallas a few years ago.  Especially love this location.  Friendly staff and managers!  Pizza is not your norm.  Very tasty.  The Cesar salad is the best."}
{"text":"Chicago style deep dish Looking for something that would not break the wallet and still have taste.  Prepare to wait awhile because its made from scratch.  Love the venue as you can watch the \"tourists & others\" walk by.  It's in the middle of the little shops so you can do some window shopping while you wait. Yes I will go back to this one.    In talking to our Lyft driver we agreed the Vegas has really declined in quality of food.  Since the tourist will come and go they can charge what they want and dish out so-so quality food.  You don't like it you're not coming back for awhile - so they don't care."}
{"text":"Okay Grimaldi's is officially open as of 7/11.  This is actually my 1st time. First good sign, they have one local beer on tap, Devil's Ale from Santan Brewing, my first choice would be Hop Knot from 4 peaks but this is not a bad choice. I ordered the white with sausage.  I am a big fan of white pizza and this one did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Very good extra thin crust pizza, nice assortment of toppings generously applied.  Service was pleasant, beer was cold.  Didn't try the calzones that some others did not like.  I willl definitely go back."}
{"text":"We love coming here for a quick pizza dinner when we first arrive in Vegas! It is a chain, but we don't have one nearby and this place has the best gourmet pizza ever! Their prices are even pretty good considering it's Vegas. I took off one star because the service is sloooow and not very friendly. Good thing the food is worth it, otherwise I would advise going elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to a Grimaldi's for the first time with my boyfriend yesterday and we chose this location! It was pretty late when we went, and business was relatively dead at the time. We were greeted by Lindsey who happened to be our server too. Very friendly staff all around! Especially Lindsey, who really made our visit there very memorable. She was helpful, describing many of the menu options with great, concise detail. She was very patient with our inexperienced selves haha!   We went basic and ordered a 12\" classic pizza with two toppings (italian sausage and spinach). It was quite filling for the both of us! They're NY-styled pizza was great! Not too crunchy and not too thin. Sauce was good and so were the toppings on it; an overall good combination in my opinion. Oh I almost forgot to mention, the food runner was friendly too! He helped served our slices!  Overall great dining experience! And not too bad for 2 people and spending under $20. If it weren't for Lindsey's great hospitality, the experience would have been average. I look forward to eating at this Grimaldi's someday again!"}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza here. The portions are big and the service is pretty consistent. I always order the pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni is extra flavorful and it shrinks up into cute little meat goodness in the high heat ovens. Atmosphere is brick style and cozy. Casual and usually busy. You can order for pick up though. Great for sit down with friends and family. My go to spot for fancy pepperoni pizzas."}
{"text":"Pet friendly.. even to our Great Dane! Food is quick, staff is very accommodating!  Pleasant experience all around!"}
{"text":"Server was nice and knowledgeable regarding the menu and the company. It's nice nowadays to see an employee take pride in their job. We ordered a beer and wine and small Cesear salad to start. The croutons were amazing! We also ordered a small pizza with pepperoni, onions, peppers, and sausage. Small is perfect amount to share. You pay per topping, but it's a thin crust NY style pizza. You don't need too many toppings. We were fatty's and also got the blueberry cheesecake...great!!  Only downfall is this place is in the mall, but I imagine it works best for their business that caters to tourists."}
{"text":"You can't argue with a restaurant that hired individuals to imitate the water in Brooklyn, NY to ensure their pizza remained as consistent as possible! Fresh dough creating the perfect thin-crust vehicle for fresh toppings that are always chewy and delicious. Housemade mozzarella! Everything about their pizzas are just amazing! I also enjoy watching them create the pizzas as well.  I love their white (garlic) sauce pizzas and I'll top it with chicken, Italian sausage, artichoke, tomatoes, mushrooms, ricotta, and fresh basil (or some combination of these ingredients). Oh, all of it is delicious. I'll even do a plain red pizza with ricotta. It's just SO GOOD. Oh, and their calzones are also great. I love that they offer shakers with dried oregano and fine garlic powder too!  The red checkered tablecloths, recycled glass bottle light fixtures, and NY paraphernalia create such a cool atmosphere for this Brooklyn staple. Perfect for a family night out, a date, or lunch with friends. Casual and classy at the same time.  Oh, and if you sign up for their e-mails, you'll get a FREE one-topping large pizza ($18 value) for your birthday!!"}
{"text":"On a resent trip to Scottsdale I had a craving for pizza; a quick Yelp search showed Gimaldi's Coal Fired Bick Oven Pizza only a few blocks away. It was 104 degrees, but it was a dry heat, so off I went.   I'm glad I did, it seems Gimaldi's of NY is opening a few franchises across the country. Anyway it was a Sunday evening about 5:00 PM and there was plenty of open seating. I was seated and after a quick look at the menu I ordered a 18\" cheese. A bit much for 1 person but I was starving and wanted a couple slices left over for a late night snack. BTW the 18\" turned out to be the perfect size for its intended use.  The secret to great pizza is the crust with requires heat, very high heat. Coal ovens produce very high heat. My pizza arrived in short order, thin crust with a nice char, lightly sauced, fresh mozzarella and fresh basil. It looked and smelled great, it tasted equally good. The fresh mozzarella and basil was a welcome change from the usual. The sauce tasted fresh and light. Very close to pizza perfection. If you like pizza with a lot of sauce and loaded with toppings I would recommend that you go somewhere else, pizza like this only get ruined loaded down. At $16 it may seem a bit pricy but for this kind of quality I find it very reasonable.   Service was very good, and décor was \"tendy\" NY. They also have a nice wine list.  Gimaldi's served me one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time. So if in Old Town Scottsdale and in the need of pizza Gimaldi's is the only choice in my book, enjoy."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. Today is Saturday so it was busy. I ordered a large Don to go. It was wonderful. I was nervous about ordering from a location in the Quarter on a busy Saturday night but it was a success. The staff was friendly and the pizza was delicious. I will be back if I need a pizza and I am in the area."}
{"text":"Best pizza place I've EVER been to in Las Vegas!!! Ever!!! Being a native New Yorker, this is the closest thing you will get to east coast pizza as it gets!! It tastes incredible, and never disappoints. I would highly recommend signing up for the birthday rewards program, where you get a free 1-topping pizza (I think). I will admit, it's a little expensive compared other places, but honestly, it's worth it."}
{"text":"ALMOST as good as the Brooklyn version!! Mental note to self: Do not order the white pizza! Stick with the red!!!  The white was delicious but definitely lacking the tang of the red sauce. Everytime we visit, we forget that we love the red and always deviate and want to \"try\" the white... only to have deja vu!  Service is friendly; pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"First timer here. Food was really good, however when I asked the waiter what the most popular pizzas were he named two. When I asked my gf which one she preferred, the waiter offered to do half and half, which I agreed. When I received the bill he charged me an additional $10 in toppings for the half pizza, even though I was already charged the full price for the more expensive pizza. Had he notified me of this I wouldn't have wasted my money"}
{"text":"Always the best pizza!  Also love their house salad. We have gone there for years and will keep going as long as their pizza stays great."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza!!  We went on a Tuesday for lunch and they had a great lunch special - $5 off a $15 dollar pizza.  Really good service too!!"}
{"text":"Arrived a 4 pm to be informed they weren't making Pizza currently. They were cleaning their oven and would be another \"maybe 45 mins\".   A pizza place that shuts down their ovens in the middle of the day and can't make any pizza.  Hmmmm"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas!!  I always get a large pepperoni and sausage pizza here.  I normally order pepperoni and mushroom at other places, but the mushroom makes the pizza a little soggy here.  Regardless, the pepperoni and sausage combination is excellent for me.  The mozarella cheese is unlike any other compared to the pizza places around here.  Plus, the pepperoni is fantastic, the right combination of spices and the tasty sausage complements it very well.  The thin crust is cooked perfectly, as it is not too crispy and not toooo limp and soggy.  As noted, I always get a large and eat the left overs the next morning or lunch.  It does not lose its taste.  I share the mediterranean salad with my wife.  The portions are huge, so we order a small.  The service is excellent here, but does get busy around 6-730pm during the weekends.  So, you might expect some wait time during those hours.  Great place to go if you have kids.  The waiter sometimes give kids pizza dough to play with.  Whenever I have visitors from out of town and want to experience something new, but don't want to go to the Strip, this place is one of my first suggestions, when they are in the mood for Italian/American.  The pizza is a little pricey if you compare it to pizza chains, but this place is well worth it.  The great taste and service is consistent, which keeps me coming back.  If you join their email list, they send you great deals, such as getting a free large pizza (dine-in) during your birthday week..."}
{"text":"OK, the jury is finally in. Grimaldi's is my favorite pizza in Las Vegas!  I've lived here for nearly five years, and I've tried all of what are purportedly the best pizza joints in town. I realize that pizza is a very personal taste, but for mine - it's Grimaldi's. I've never had a bad pizza there.   I tend to change up what  pizza I order. Recently, I had their special white pizza. I don't remember the exact name of it, though I do recall that it had arugula and prosciutto. OMG - it was DELICIOUS. I think any pizza you order at Grimaldi's would be wonderful, but this is my favorite so far.  If you like Caesar salad, theirs is way above the normal pizza restaurant quality. The small size is more than enough for two!  Service has always been good, the wine list is decent for a pizza place, and the food has never missed. If you haven't tried Grimaldi's, do yourself a favor and check them out. I don't think you'll regret it!! Not the cheapest place in town, but if it's quality you seek, Grimaldi's has it!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while. We used to love this place but today it taste no different than Fired Pie but twice the cost. It also didn't help that the one hostess didn't seem like she wanted to be here today. Two stars bc waitress was nice and bruschetta was good."}
{"text":"My party of 4 ordered two 16\" pizzas: - pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, and spinach (yum) - sun-dried tomatoe, onion, and mushroom (even more yum)  This is the best pizza I have ever had, but I have never been to Chicago or New York or anywhere else that's known for pizza. But the cheese on these pizzas was super good and much better than the regular shredded cheese that is usually on pizza!!! Also I love thin crust!!   Decor was cool because there were lights inside of beer bottles! I found that pretty unique ..   Minus a star because the pizza was expensive and the service was extremely slow.. I think my party looked really young (newly turned 21 peeps!) and the restaurant people thought we were kids who wouldn't tip well so they served everyone else before us :-("}
{"text":"I'm not from New York, so I can't speak about authenticity, but I am pizza lover, so that I can talk about. Their crust is very thin and crispy, and was delicious. They have a variety of toppings, so we built our own (onion, garlic, spinach, jalapeno and Italian sausage). The toppings were OK, but the sauce and crust are what makes it. Our large 18\" came out to @ $30, which is a bit pricey, but not having many chances to eat pizza of this quality in HI, it was definitely worth it. I would definitely come back if I didn't have to fly 6 hours to do it."}
{"text":"Awesome service and incredible food! Love their outdoor patio and proximity to the DC Ranch park. Ordered the Don pizza and caesar salad. Great great great!"}
{"text":"I've been to a couple other Girmaldi's in AZ and this one seems to have the nicest outdoor seating. Even though it still faces the parking lot there are trees and the nice Rolex street clock. My dining partner and I came for Tax Day Pizza Special $10.40 for a 16in. pizza... sweet deal. We sat outside. Our service was a bit spotty, took awhile for our server to come over.  We ordered 2 16in. pizza, mine cheese and the other pepperoni. The restaurant was not busy at the least but still the pizzas took awhile to come out. When they did they were delicious, perfectly cooked, lots of pepperoni on the pepperoni pizza. Honestly Grimaldi's is one of my favorite places.  Atmosphere: nicer outdoor seating than the other 2 locations I've been at. Service: OK, a little spotty with wait time. Food: Love it!"}
{"text":"When we come here it's always for lunch. Good service and consistent pizza. This time we sat at the bar. Ashlea our bartender/server was great!  We had our regular Large Pepperoni and a couple of ice cold beers  Good service, good pizza and ice cold beers... what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"We went to Grimaldi's last night on our way home from Scottsdale.  There was no wait for a table.  We ordered the pizza with red sauce, with fresh garlic and cheese.  The pizza was fabulous; as good as the best NYC pizza (and I've had a LOT of that).    The only reason I didn't  give it 4 stars is because I'd like to see soup or a few appetizers offered.  When I asked about bread, the waitress offered to bring some Italian bread, along with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I'd prefer something a little more substantial to soak up the beer, but the bread was good and served its purpose."}
{"text":"Our food sucked and so did the service.  Pizza had almost no cheese and was slightly burned.  Salad was all lettuce with hardly any onions and other veggies.  Waitress could have cared less that our food was crap."}
{"text":"First off I gave this a 4 because of the food, It's just thin brick oven pizza at best.  The service and atmosphere here inside the Palazzo is very good.  I was with two other friends on my trip here, we all ordered individual pizzas.  My pizza came out with an imperfection in the pizza and was told I got another pizza to go for FREE! I thought what am I going to do with this pizza?  One of my other friend's also got a free pizza because theirs was too burnt.  So 2 free pies to go on my last night there. Note it was about 10pm or so and I was leaving in the morning, kind of a waste of pizza.  Saw a lot of pies going out that night for free, must have been those young guys making them!  My one friend got the small 500ml water which was purified from somewhere. Not as good as the cosmo water!  Try this place out if you like flat pizza and free pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Vegas. Very good brick oven new york style pizza."}
{"text":"Sehr gute Pizza zum selbst zusammenstellen.  16\" war für eine Einzelperson allerdings zu viel, 12\" hätten gereicht :-)"}
{"text":"I love Grimaldis. Very good pizza each and every time. I can never turn down a suggestion for Grimaldis! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Pizza everything.  Simple ingredients executed to perfection.  One of my favorite pizza places in AZ.  if your looking for great tasting NY style thin crust look no further.   Pepperoni, sun dried tomatoes, and basil pizza is so good.  Love the brick oven flavor.   Being able to watch them make your pizza just adds to the experience.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Bad experience all around. We decided on Grimaldi's for Mother's day. Our service was iffy at best, but hell, we were excited for the pizza and calzone's. The pizza was adequate and nothing special. All the cheese shakers on the table had spoiled cheese, so that was no good. Also, they put the basil on before they cooked the pizza. That's a no no. In a 700 degree oven it comes out burnt. Did I mention the area we were sitting in had at least 5 flies fying around the whole time? The calzone's looked great, but there was something off. Each person who tasted the 4 calzone's said something was off. The texture was all wrong, the sausage that we asked for was ground up like ground beef and had no taste. Needless to say, except for the kids who enjoyed playing with dough, everyone at our table said they won't be back. Being from Brooklyn and knowing the kind of food Grimaldi's is capable of, we were very disapointed."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Grimaldi's and I thought it was just okay. I went to see what all the hype was about from my friends and after eating the food there I just thought it was okay. Nothing that I ordered which was large pepperoni and spicy chicken sausage pizza with Cesar salad and a bottle of wine wow'ed me. I am from Chicago and for this to be Chicago pizza I was definitely disappointed. But on he other hand their customer service was very lovely."}
{"text":"Being from New York (albeit, never having eaten at the original Grimaldi's), I was a little skeptical about how it would be in Vegas, but it did not disappoint. The pizza was delicious and hot. We went with the classic margarita without the fresh tomatoes on top and it was mouth watering. Perfect ratio of cheese to sauce. We also tried a Greek-type salad, which was very good and fresh. Lettuce was extremely crispy! Great option, especially if you're dining with kids."}
{"text":"Food is great, the owner is an awesome guy. The guys in the kitchen are a bit slow in getting the food out and joke around a little too much with eachother, part from that The pizza is the best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here low on cash (I'm not quite sure how I ended up in Scottsdale with that attitude), so I scanned the menu for the best bang for my buck. I ended up ordering a calzone with jalapeños and grilled chicken. Best. Decision. Ever.  The waitress came out with a huge calzone stuffed to the seams with cheese, peppers, and chicken, accompanied by three pizzas that my party ordered for themselves. The dough was crispy without being too hard, and the filling had the perfect ratio of ingredients. It was big enough that I had to concede defeat and accept taking home part of it as leftovers.   As an added plus, our waitress was a lot of fun to talk to; even though it was pretty busy, she still made enough time to have conversations with us when she would come over. Definitely a thumbs up from me!"}
{"text":"Regular retail price $31. Paid $11. Joined the Grimaldi's email club and they sent me a coupon for a free pizza up to $20 on my birthday. It said one topping but they let us pay the difference for The Don. The atmosphere on the patio is much more calm than eating inside with all the family noise. The staff is friendly and attentive. The only thing I would change is that some of the tables outside needed to have used napkins removed, but we were there near closing so I'm sure it got taken care of at the end of the night."}
{"text":"What!?? No ranch!??? Are you kidding me? I know it sounds dumb but seriously the fact that they don't serve ranch just to prove a point is ridiculous, snobby and rude. Even my boyfriend was half tempted to run over to Barro's Pizza and buy a couple side ranches to bring back. Lol I asked the manager why they didn't have ranch and he said it's because the owners feel that pizza shouldn't be eaten with ranch. Well good for you owners, glad you have a stick up your bum and don't want to let your customers enjoy food the way they want it. Yes I'm making a stink over ranch and I'm fine with it. You should be able to eat food the way you'd like. Stop dictating my taste buds! Why have salt and pepper shakers? Why have oregano, red pepper flakes or parmesan cheese? Why not just change the menu and have one pizza, only made one way? Why have choices at all? Okay now that I'm done ranting I will say the pizza was excellent. It was. I will admit it. But I still want my ranch damn it! Ranch would have made it even better. Hm! Oh..and while the pizza was really good it's waaaaay over priced. It's pizza guys, pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is another spot in our rotation for Pizza Fridays at work. My first experience with Grimaldi's was at the location in Old Town. I thought it was just mediocre. But the more I go, the more that it grows on me.   It's a very thin crust style pizza which I guess right there is probably why I'm not a huge fan. But the cheese to sauce ratio is pretty bad. There's very little sauce and frankly not a whole lot of cheese either. I do love their pepperoni and my coworkers all love it too so that's what we usually get. The pepperoni is supper greasy though, but what else can you expect? I wouldn't come here if you're trying to be health conscious.   The prices also aren't very budget friendly. A personal pizza is $9 but then you have to pay an additional $2 for toppings! What a rip off. You can get a much better pizza at Spinato's and it'll cost you a whole lot less. We try to get larges so that we can share and cut down on costs because they always tell us that if we do personal pizzas they'll come out at different times and makes it sound like such a hassle. This never seems to be a problem at the place I mentioned earlier. A large pizza has 8 slices. We can usually eat 2-3 slices per person depending on how hungry we are.   The service is usually pretty good/competent and the staff is friendly and will greet you at the door. It's never busy during lunch so it's pretty quick for a sit down place. I noticed that they have a small private party room too which could be good for a small party. I'll never say no to Grimaldi's but it's definitely not my pick if I want some pizza."}
{"text":"Very good thin crust pizza. The personal size will allow you to take half home with you, so portions are generous depending on your appetite. I was disappointed that they do not have wifi."}
{"text":"I went here the other night and loved it. Pizza was very good quality with great taste, and the atmosphere is excellent. I'd give it 5 stars but saying this is the BEST pizza place is a bold statement. This was excellent though in every way."}
{"text":"I LOVE Grimaldi's!  Since I moved to Scottsdale, I've been looking for great pizza place and I'm super picky about my pizza, haha.  But one drunk evening, my friends and I stumbled in for some pizza.  I remember thinking it was the greatest thing in the world.  I worried that it might not be as great sober, but I was wrong! It's so delicious and perfect every time! I was recently calling in a takeout order and this fabulous employee Dominic recommended the pesto pizza with tomato and the spicy chicken sausage.  OMG! I will be ordering this every time. So good! This is by far our favorite pizza! Even when my family came to visit, they loved it too!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out the famous Grimaldi's and I was a bit disappointed.  The pizza was ok, but not as good as I was expecting.  The crust was good but the pizza was nearly missing an important ingredient.....tomato sauce.  I loved the thin crust, but it's a lot easier to make the crust thin and crispy when there is practically no sauce."}
{"text":"My 12 year old daughter and I really love Grimaldi's. Even after trying the other usual Phoenix contenders, this one remains our favorite. The savory sauce and melted balls of fresh mozzarella cheese are the best. Our regular go-to order is a Caesar salad and \"red sauce with Italian sausage\" pizza.  Recently, I came in for my birthday with their birthday deal. If you sign up to be on their email list, you can get a free 1 item large pizza! Best birthday deal. Ever. Our waiter that night, AJ, was so friendly. He genuinely seemed happy and excited that it was my birthday! Thanks, AJ & Grimaldi's, for making my birthday awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my second, and last trip to Grimaldi's. It's easy to overlook things when you get a good meal, when the food is bad the rest of the experience is bad too. Walking in the door the kitchen looks like a high school cafeteria prep station. Kids slapping one item on pizza dough and sliding it to the next \"child chef\" on the assembly line. The pizza is expensive. The dough ranges from $12-18 and the toppings are $2-5 each. We ordered ham and fresh tomatoes. The ham was cubed chunks of cooked ham like you might expect in an omelet, not on a pizza. The tomatoes we over ripe and wilted Romas that had been in a hot kitchen far to long. I guarantee you would be much happier with a Pizza Hut takeout and a bottle of gas station wine than you will be paying over $20 for a cafeteria quality pie.  The place is noisy and crowded and the two birthday parties with a dozen girls running around the tables with junk from their loot bags did not add to the experience.  There are so many better strip mall pizza places that don't cost near as much that deliver far better quality than Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Shelly was fantastic. I brought my grandma with me and she took care of all her needs. This is the first time we had Shelly and we will be back and ask for her.  I also appreciated how the waiters had their own order book personalized. It is a great tool for employee morale and an awesome conversation piece."}
{"text":"I was in town for a wedding, staying with friends...They are big time pizza lovers (aren't we all though) and recommended this place as their favorite piza. As Grimaldi's is right next to Hooters (we were looking for wings and pizza type of thing) we popped by Hooters..got our wing on...and then walked the 40 feet to Grimaldis... It looked like pretty typical pizzeria decor...but with a full bar (and some good Sonoma wines as well)...Ordered up some pizzas..We got an XL sausage, pepp, garlic... It was some of the better thin crust pizza I'd had!  Never tried a coal fired place...I always ask for crispy crust, but for some reason I didn't this time as I've heard coal fired pizza pie is crispier than most due to oven temp...Well it was crispy, and totally delicious!   The very professional and courteous waitress brings our pie out and instantly (before the pie hit the table mind you) offered up her apologies saying that this particular pie wasn't up to their standards at Grimaldis..but she brought it anyway as she knew we were hungry (despite my 5 wings and cold beers ala Hooters).  She went on to explain that they noticed there was a hole in the pizza, and that a whole new pizza was being prepped right then..No one at the table even had a chance to notice the hole..and they already were replacing it!  We all ate our fill, and then voila...a fresh, delicious pizza hit the table.  We had 1/2 of a pizza for snacks on the long drive home to Sonoma county!!   Not only was it completely great pizza...the staff and management exhibited the highest level of professionalism, courtesy, and commitment to offering up only a superior product...In an area filled with all manner of culinary delights..from ridiculously expensive, to $10 buffets...well, this place earned my business EVERY time I get to Vegas...Eat here for great pie, great service, and great memories! Kudos to Grimaldis on Rainbow for making my trip!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally gave this place a shot and I'm so glad we did!  Excellent service (our waiter was Elmer. He was awesome)  Excellent food  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This pizza is simply amazing. I have never been disappointed eating here. I always order Pepporoni, jalipenios, (baked in), fresh mushrooms and inion.  Also in my opinion the Ceaser Saled is the best in town. They have an outdoor patio so it's nice to eat ou there when weather is good.   Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's the ambiance or the lack of excitement that removed a star. We've been to the one under the Brooklyn bridge where we waited 2 hours to get a seat, in the hot July heat at the concrete jungle that is New York. Coming here, the place wasn't packed. It took awhile to walk around and try to find it in the Palazzo when the Palazzo isn't typically a place we would stop in for.   We got seated on the deck area facing the hallways. We watched a guy passed out and security trying to get him to move. He was clearly intoxicated and on a few other stuff. It was amusing to watch while we wait for our pizza.   We shared an extra large pizza with basil, their buffalo mozzarella and some pepperonis. It was delicious but I guess the fact that it wasn't in NY had something to do with it to deflate my excitement a bit. The waitress had a strong italian accent that really appealed to my father-in-law (who is Italian).   We've been dying to try this place in Vegas so craving fulfilled!"}
{"text":"Great New York style pizza! They have a really tasty dough recipe (well seasoned), and an excellent selection of toppings. I also tried the calzone- I would definitely get this again. The ricotta cheese was delicious and the size- wow! I couldn't finish the personal size. Everything is made fresh to order. The Caesar salad was also excellent- the dressing tasted fresh made, topped with high quality Parmesan."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is NY-style national pizza franchise that in my humble opinion should already inhabit every major US city.  Unfortunately they have not spread into my now-home state of Washington but the day they do I will be an immediate patron.  The only reason I can imagine how this particular location has been rated under 4 stars is that some people must not like incredible pizza or somehow had a very unusual bad experience due to astral conjunctions or recent brain trauma.  I LOVE PIZZA.  And I have NEVER had a better pizza than a Grimaldi's.  Their concept is simple:  pick a pizza type (there are 3: red, white, pesto), then pick your toppings (there are many).  And I guarantee you that if you are not satisfied, one of the excellent managers (the chief being Ahn, one of my favorite restaurant managers of all time) will address your concerns and respond accordingly.  The staff is always friendly, knowledgable, and prompt.  Now can we get back to the food?  If you like power-spicy-loaded pizzas, try this one.  Red sauce, Italian sausage, onion, green pepper, jalepeno.  If you absolutely need another topping, go pepperoni or maybe a fave veggie depending on your temperament.  And I guarantee (again) that the house carries at least one wine that will pair very nicely with your pie selection.  Grimaldi's management goes out of their way to train even the least wine-knowledgable servers (some are under 21) how to advise on wine pairing selections.  With the above-mentioned pizza I recommend a strong red in the cabernet to zinfandel range.  Their white wine selection is equally diverse, and there are always 6-7 solid taps for the beer enthusiast.  Now about the Happy Hour.  It does not exist BUT DO NOT FRET.  The house red and white are both priced at $4, ALL DAY, ALL WEEK.  Beers are also reasonably priced.  Last I was there, liquor was not an option.  Please do not skip on this incredible pie for that reason; this is a mistake.  This is the best pizza in Arizona.  Want a salad?  No problem.  There are numerous delicious options.  Want dessert?  I have one word for you:  Tiramisu.  Cheesecakes also rarely disappoint.  Even if this Tempe location is too far for you to drive, there are 5 other Phoenix locations that carry the same incredible quality.  Caveat:  You usually cannot get a pizza between 4pm and 5pm because they must re-stoke the coal ovens.  This is a fact that has miffed a few customers over the years but is a necessary fact of coal-oven pizza making.  Trust me, it is worth the wait.  4.7 stars!  Best bartender:  Ellie, assuming she still works there.  Rock N Roll baby"}
{"text":"What a fantastic brick oven pizza! My husband and I stopped in for lunch on a whim and were pleasantly surprised. The ambience is friendly and relaxing. Very clean with friendly service. We received our pizza and I was in heaven... The cheese alone.... Mmmmmmm yummy!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza from Grimaldi's. My first visit was in the fashion show mall and it was delish. I proceeded to order from the Eastern location and the pizza didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in New York about a month ago and tried several pizza places while we were there. In comparison to New York pizza, this Grimaldi's location was pretty good. We just ordered one pepperoni pizza and that was plenty to feed four of us. I was really a fan of the sauce in the pizza. I'm a sucker for good pizza sauce. Our waitress was very attentive and our drinks were all refilled multiple times , she came by often to ask how we were doing and how the food was. My only question is if you're going to give bread with balsamic vinegar and olive oil to all tables why not have a little bowl dish for it? We had to either just put it on a flat plate or straight on the bread. Didn't work out too well. Maybe that's just me who thinks that is annoying but other than that I enjoyed the pizza and out service."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great.    Pro's Pizza had a great, bubbly crust Ingredients were fresh Service was good Great wine selection, tons of affordable botles   Con's The menu has no pizza suggestions, (margarita, meat lover whatever) just cheese and then you choose your toppings and pay for each. That makes for a pricey pizza ahould you order a lot of toppings.   Red checkered tablecloths and big band music reminded me to much of Oregano's.   Overall it was a decent experience, but with so many pizza places in the valley I'm not sure I'd  go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! I've tried many kinds of pizza from east coast to west coast. This place is hands down the best. Caesar salad is great! For pizza, get the white garlic with mushroom, sausage and pepperoni. 3 toppings are enough for pizza. All the ingredients are fresh. I even tired Grimaldi's in Texas and wherever city you go for Grimaldi's, it always taste the same."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Desserts always a thumbs up! Pizza wise loved it! Tried the pepperoni w sausage and the 4 cheese pizza! Plenty of cheese and sausage !  I'll be back w the rest of the pizza lovers!   Salads always plenty & hearty w the tomatoes & onions.  Will try something else on the menu next time around! Great place for family dinners & there wasn't a long wait."}
{"text":"Okay, I SO don't get people's obsession with Grimaldi's.  This is the second time I've tried is (I thought the first time I didn't like it was because I just ordered the wrong thing), but this latest trip confirmed my dislike. And I know what it is. The cheese. Oh no, not the cheese!!!! Yes, the cheese. It tastes fake. Seriously. And when it melts it makes the pizza look like plastic. In fact, it kind of tastes like plastic, too. I liked the thin crust and the sauce, but the cheese is awful. The house salad was lacking in color and freshness, too.   Oh, and our server? I hope she was having a bad day because she had the snootiest attitude I think I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"The one star is for service which was excellent.  It's not their fault that this pizza is nothing more than a slab of cardboard with a paltry dab of sauce and suggestion of cheese.  Flavorless and overpriced.  What a racket."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzerias In town, defiantly one of my top choices when going out for pizza. Service is always great, waiters and waitresses are always at the top of there game. Great atmosphere and the place is always clean, which is very important to me.  Highly recommend, trust me I'm from New York I know what good food is all about."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza as usual. Incredibly loud, as usual. Inside dining is just amazingly loud, kids yelling at the top of their lungs w parents unaware and disrespectful of diners around them. Our server apologized and said others were leaving because of it, but this isn't the first time. It's just not the place for anyone that doesn't want to yell at each other over a 30\" wide table."}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as I originally thought. I tried a few other sit-in pizza places in the area and realized that I was rather unimpressed here. Tomatoes or something on the pizza ended up making me sick the next day.   Still +1 stars for the good service though."}
{"text":"If you're familiar w/ the original in Brooklyn, this is the same place. We've eaten at the Brooklyn location near the bridge and this, to my surprise, tasted exactly the same. The Margareta (standard pizza there) w/ Xtra Basil is what we had. We also had the Spinach salad. Both were HUGE and fantastic. The small pizza is 16\". Looked like a large. The Spinach salad was fresh and fantastic. This was the cheapest and most filling meal we had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow this pizza is tasty.  We celebrated with a bunch of people and our waitress was fast and attentive.  The pizza is probably one of my favorites in the valley.   The cheese was high quality and there were toppings aplenty.  It wasn't too greasy; it was just right.  I deducted one star for the limited menu.  I wish they served wings and other typical items found at most pizza joints.  This place is definitely worth it if you love good pizza."}
{"text":"We went here tonight at 4 pm after seeing a movie. They sat us and there was only one other table seated. The other table had a pizza they where eating. When our server came up to us he said they just started stoking the oven and there would not be pizza available for an hour!! Really??  All you have on your menu is salad and pizza!  If you need to stoke the oven close the place for an hour to get ready for dinner service. Most places start happy hour at 3 or 4 so Grimaldi's should be ready for the dinner crowd by 4!!! We went to Sauce instead and had an awesome experience!!"}
{"text":"First time here and absolutely love it! Pizza is very good. Tried it with Pepperoni, Mushroom and Spinach. Really Delicious food. Love the ambiance, cool wine bottle chandelier. Very quick service, food was cooked fast and very nice servers."}
{"text":"Amazing food and fresh vegetables!! Pizza is amazing!! Ordered anchovies pizza with black olivea!!"}
{"text":"Grimmaldi's has some of the best pizza in the phoenix area. The service is always super friendly and timely. They don't skip a beat!"}
{"text":"best pizza i ever tasted...AMAZING.....and i just got the pepperoni.....i wish i would've put more on it.............really goood"}
{"text":"I just want to give a big thanks to our incredible waitperson Colton!!!! Made our great pizza and salad even better!"}
{"text":"What's all of the hype? There is better pizza in town like everywhere. Napolis, Sammy's, Angelina's, Rocco's NY PIzza, etc. etc."}
{"text":"2 stars for service. 5 stars for how they address mistakes. 3 stars for the pizza.   My elite friends wanted to try this right before we left Vegas. I had been to the one in NYC, and supposedly they use NYC water here. I was willing to give it a shot. I still dream about NYC pizza 4 years after my visit there (I couldn't eat California pizza for 6 months afterward; it just made me angry) so I'm a little skeptical of anything this far from the east coast.   It's a small restaurant inside of a mall, and gets crowded quickly. We were a party of 7. You can see the fashion shows from the restaurant.  We ordered a large white pizza, a large pesto, and a large meat pizza, along with a large Caesar salad. The salad was perfect. Not for the health-conscious with the amount of dressing used, but perfect. The they started bringing us small pizzas. We told the server that we had ordered 3 larges, and since the pizzas took so long to make, the manager told us to go ahead and keep them on the house and they would bring out the larges. The 3 large pizzas were more than enough alone to feed our table, so we had sooooo much extra pizza. They also accidentally brought an extra large meat pizza, but told us to keep that one as well!  I wish the rest of our visit was just as great. Before and after the pizzas were dropped off, we were completely ignored. I had to ask three times for another beer because it was forgotten, there were empty water glasses, etc. Maybe they could somehow tell I had too much beer over the weekend and didn't need anymore, but still!  The pizza was good, but didn't blow me away like the NYC version had. They did a great job on the crispy crust. The pesto was my favorite, the white pizza was too garlickly, and none of them seemed cheesy enough. It didn't have that life-changing, holy-crap-I-am-moving-to-NY like other pizzas I've had, but it was still good.   Could have been a 5-star experience if the pizza and service were a little better! I enjoyed Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan much more."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza pies!!! If you can't have it in New York and your in Las Vegas definitely go here for pizza. The pizza is so delicious.  They use Buratta cheese and the crust is perfect.  The toppings are not an over kill.  Just great pizza.  However this location is in the mall but why not.  It's Vegas."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!  One of my favorite.  If you make it to NY then go to the original spot.  Pizza pie that is moist but with a medium crust cooked perfectly.  You can make your own combination style. Please do the fresh garlic with meatballs and pepperoni.  White garlic pizza iS what it's all about. It's freakin good stuff.  Of course pairing it with a nice red vino and your set.  Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza (we had pepperoni, Italian sausage w/extra mozzarella); fresh ingredients and good quality meats. Only negative was we arrived during a shift change and ended up having to wait 45 minutes for our food to come out...at least it was hot."}
{"text":"Let me not over exaggerate now...Grimaldi's Pizzeria is abruptly becoming my favorite pizza in the CITY! I've been here twice, first time no review, second I have to. The 16' classic with pep, bacon, and Italian sausage is amazing! Everything I want in a pie and this was it. The crust, perfect balance of crispyness to bendable for folding. Also, not to thick and I wouldn't call it thin. Just the right amount of sauce and ingredients that taste great and full of flavor. The cheese, and I don't care much about cheese is also freaking perfect because it's not too much but it's there and it's good. I forgot we also had a Caesar salad, can't complain here very fresh. To top off the great food, our server was perfect! If you like pizza, brick oven pizza to be exact...you need to try Grimaldi's at Park West!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like the pizza here, but was disappointed. The pizza came out slightly cold and with extremely thick, chewy cheese. The rest of the ingredients were good, but I could not get past the hard, thick, chewy cheese. I actually had to pick off the cheese and eat just the rest of the pizza. I order the white pizza without tomato sauce."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Grimaldi's and I loved it!  There were three of us and I really wanted a calzone while they wanted pizza.  So I got a small calzone and they got a small pizza and we shared a salad.  I think it was the house salad, so good!  I LOVED the calzone.  The only thing to be careful of is that if you want to have the pizza split with different toppings on the two sides they charge you for one of the pizzas and then for the other side they charge you for each individual topping, which are like $2 each.  So not worth it and they don't make that super clear.  Otherwise our waiter was great and we loved the food!"}
{"text":"The only problem with this place is that it is a 5 1/2 hour plane ride away.  The brick oven pizza is incredible. We got pepperoni and meatball toppings. The sauce is really good.    I need to copy their sauce and dough recipe for home use :)."}
{"text":"Always a crowded house when I come here.  I have order pizza here a few times and have been pleased.  Lots of good toppings to choose from but I'm more of a veggie pizza person.  The pizza was nice and neat.  I appreciate a sense of symmetry in the placing of my pizza toppings.  Not only does it show that the chef takes a bit of pride in their work but it also insures that I can taste the toppings better with every bite.  I am normally not a crust person, but I can finish this one.  Good sized pizzas too.    So far my take out experiences here have been good ones.  I'll let you know how it goes whenever I go back to dine in."}
{"text":"Kind of a bummer, to be honest. When in Vegas, I love to visit the Grimaldi's at the Palazzo - its pizza is just amazing and the prices are reasonable. So when I saw that there was a Grimaldi's in Scottsdale a few blocks from my hotel, I had to check it out.  And so that's what I did a few days ago. I walked up to the bar, grabbed a stool, and placed my order: a 12\" traditional pizza with pepperoni, onions, jalapenos, and mushrooms.   When the pie arrived it looks good, but then I starting eating it and the disappointment only grew. For starters, the cheese had a slightly funky taste that I don't recall from my meals at their Vegas location. And secondly, the crust didn't seem to have the char that I'm accustomed to. Each slice was quite floppy, a bit soggy, and the dough seemed less cooked than I'd like, especially towards the middle.   So overall, I was disappointed in the food. And while the bartender was friendly and I liked the ambiance, I can't give this place more than 3 stars. Ugh.  Hugs, C"}
{"text":"Went to have dinner at Grimaldi's Pizzeria in the Grand Canal Shoppes with my family. And was looking forward to some fantastic pizza! At first i thought it was going to be a great experience, ambiance is pretty nice. Then our server completely forgot about us after taking our order! He brought our paid bottle of water, but we also asked for regular water also, as we had been outside in 95-100 degree weather for a couple of hours, and were super thirsty! Then he completely forgot about us, till we asked for the bill. Another food runner brought us our water and refilled our glasses, brought us our food, asked if we were ok. I wished I could have given him my tip instead of the actual server! Pizza was fine. But I'd dare to say it wasn't even as good as JJ Dolan's back at home, in Honolulu!! Maybe the service influenced how much I enjoyed my meal?? Service is important!"}
{"text":"Great pizzas and good selection of beer. I always try to eat here while staying at Venetian."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic NY style pizza, this is the place to be.  It's in the middle of the Fashion Show mall on the first floor right in front of the catwalk, across from the Apple store. They provide both indoor and \"patio\" style seating facing the mall. The restaurant itself has a lot of NY decor including pictures and signs.  The servers are very attentive and the food comes out pretty quick. It's perfect to come and eat on ur own too since they do offer personal size pizzas and bar seating. I am a small girl, so i wasn't able to finish the personal pizza, so maybe a man  would be satisfied with a personal.   I would reccomend asking for extra sauce, just because i felt the pizza was a little dry with the normal amount of sauce it came with."}
{"text":"Great first visit, Peroni on tab and great pizza. Second time there was no peroni on tab (run out) and the first pizza took a long time to come out and it was cold. Second pizza came out burnt and had pastry bubbles all over.  Got in comped so that's why the four and no less. Everyone has a bad day so look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I want to love this pizza, I really do. The pizza looks and smells good, but the taste just does not match the presentation. It's a mediocre pizza disguised as a delicious pizza. I can't quite pinpoint what was wrong with the pizza either. The sauce? The cheese? The toppings? The crust? Its a mystery that I will not attempt to answer again. Surprisingly enough, even though the pizza was a huge disappointment they make a mean calzone at Grimaldi's. Also, I love the decor they have with makeshift lanterns made out of empty wine bottles. With so many pizza places strewn about the valley there are better options than Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Fantastic food - great calzone and piping hot fresh pizza plus an awesome spinach salad with ice cold spinach"}
{"text":"This Vegas location tastes better than the actual Grimaldi's in NY. No wait too!! It's the best \"cheap\" food you'll get in Vegas.  5+++++++++ stars"}
{"text":"Our company ordered delivery pizza here, they were talking it up.  The food here is pricey. Our pizza had very very flat crust, sparse cheese and very greasy, i will not order here on my own. It is supposed to be italian inspired, meh. Gross over priced greasy crap."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon lunch at great location. Ate inside in bar and they changed the channel so we could watch NFL Playoffs. Food was great and my Kale salad was the bomb with lots of chicken and fresh artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, Cucumbers and crispy lettuce.  Pizza looked good but my buddies ate that.  Good service and s always filled ice tea with ice!"}
{"text":"Location is fantastic. Right near the entrance of Palazzo. Came here late night for dinner. We had the quattro fromaggio and it was good. The base was not too thick and kind of an authentic naan pizza which we love. I found the crust to be too hard and taste was OK for me. Have to try the other pizzas some other time to get an idea on the flavors."}
{"text":"If you like genuine NY brick oven pizza made with fresh mozzarella,tasty tomato sauce and quality meats, this is da place! Choice of freshly made crusts..thick or thin..both are great. I'm fourth generation off the boat  Italian and fussy about my pizza and this really hits the spot. A large pizza with toppings is a reasonable under $20.00. Mangia!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Grimaldi's Las Vegas. I love New York pizza and a coal oven is a big reason. We loved the salad for 4. It was just the right amount of dressing and good stuff. The antipasto platter was very good too. As for the pizza...while it's not real New York it was as close as I've had anywhere outside of NY. The sausage was fantastic and the bubbly, charred crust was one of the highlights. Love that stuff. They also made an Italian Margarita that was delicious and not too sweet. We got there a bit before 5 and had to wait for our pizza because they don't start the oven until 5. But that was a great move because we got a nice table in the patio area. At 5 when the ovens fired up the crowd rolled in quickly. The great salad, antipasto and Margaritas made the wait for the ovens a breeze."}
{"text":"Pizza is my thing and this pizza is decent. Not the best but pretty a-okay. Ordered the personal pepperoni pizza with extra cheese. Was in a rush so got seated at the bar for faster service. Pizza came out 20 mins after I placed order. Service was very good and the decor is nice and comfortable. Prices are ver affordable. Not a bad place to come for a quick and very affordable bite at dinner time."}
{"text":"Best pizza around!! The coal brick oven makes the crust perfectly toasted not burnt! Best flavors, variety of the freshest toppings.  huge selection of wine and beers on tap. My favorite white wine Equilibrium. The best seasonal cheesecake, we all have a secret love hate relationship with Girl Scout cookies so you must try the Samoa cookie cheesecake. My favorite Friday night spot, or occasional Wednesday night at the bar after work no matter that time of day in the week they always treat me like I'm VIP. Shout outs to my favorite people. Ken is an amazing manager. I watch him go around to all the tables and making sure everyone is enjoying their meals, if you can remember my name let alone my go to meal that's impressive! Grimaldis has such a great atmosphere all the employees have such fun attitudes and are really knowledgeable about the menu. Nick usually works behind the bar but does a little of everything he has been with Grimaldis for years but he is the single hardest working guy in the biz! Love getting to come in and chat it up with him. Danny and John are my go to boys. If I don't get to sit in their section I'll wait!! Thank you for such an enjoyable meal!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to enjoy a day out shopping and were in need of some lunch.  This location had literally just opened for the day so we were able to walk right in.  We were seated promptly as there was only one other table seated at the time.  Our waiter came to grab our drink order.  We ordered two diet pepsis and the waiter literally walked to the bar, and walked back with drinks which ended up being iced tea for both.  He walked away before we could say anything.  We flagged him down and told him about the mix up.  He apologized and switched the drinks out.  When I looked at my glass there was dried what appeared to be lettuce on the side of my glass.  Within 10 minutes of being here we were already on strike two.  We finally ordered our food. Make sure things are clean before opening for the day.  If one of the first glasses that go out for the day is dirty it makes me wonder how dirty the place actually is."}
{"text":"By far the BEST pizza I've had in Las Vegas!!  My parents are on a cross county road trip, and by time they got to Vegas, they had been missing some good pizza. A friend of mine in Phoenix said that she ate at a Grimaldi's and it was the first real East Coast pizza she's had in the 2 years she has been there, so we decided to check this places out. We realized that this is an offshoot of the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and in Hoboken that we had eaten at many times so I was pumped.    Grimaldi's did not disappoint at all and totally lived up to my high expectations. The three of us split a delicious antipasto platter with mozzarella, salami, olives, bread, and peppers. I would totally get it again. Then we split a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza and it was amazing. The toppings were fresh and delicious, the crust was perfect, and the seasoning was just right. They do put parmesan on the pizza, and thankfully we asked them not to since my dad hates it, and they were very accommodating.   The service was friendly, at just the right pace, and the atmosphere was great. I loved the patio seating as well. Without a doubt I will be back again."}
{"text":"LOVE the pizza...We have been here for the 3rd time and I always order order the personal pizza:  Artichokes, garlic, mushrooms and ricotta cheese. Hubby:  pepperoni, sausage, olives, mushrooms, pepper flakes liberally sprinkled... Pretty restaurant and the waitress was very nice.  I wish I remembered her name.  We always take leftover pizza home as it takes so good the next day too! They will be opening up a new on on Rainbow off of 215."}
{"text":"I got my Birthday free large pizza. We ordered grilled chicken pesto pizza.  It was delicious.  Omg idk how they do it, but they have the best pizza ever....my fave pizza place.   so yummy.  Thank you Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"I love this place! My wife and I had our first date here when we met in June of 2013 and we've been coming here ever since. We come in every Monday or Tuesday and sit in the corner of the bar and get our usual...the Quattro Formaggi, with pizza sauce and precooked pepperoni...literally the greatest pizza ever created and I owe my knowledge of it to the bartender Kurt!  Kurt and Vince always take great care of us and we will continue to be regulars as long as we're living in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Consistently great food and service! Patio seating is great when the weather is good. Caesar salad is delicious! Pizza always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I came in here for the first time with my mom and wasn't very impressed. There was lots of empty tables when we came in, and yet had to wait 20 or something minutes. When seated, we ordered half an hour later a specialty pizza. We got the pizza and it tasted so bad, we couldn't finish our first slice. They used way to much salt and I almost choked because of the taste. I brought this up to the attention of our server and she took the pizza away and alerted the manager. We re-ordered and got a plain pizza, just with cheese and onions. It tasted slightly better, but not to the point of amazing. The pizza wasn't very tasty or had a \"wow\" factor. We didn't finish that one either.   Just your average pizza place, there's nothing great about this place.   Kudos to the manager and my server though! Both were amazing.  5 Stars for customer service  2 Stars for food"}
{"text":"Bomb bomb bomb...so bomb.  This is the best spot for pizza that i have been to in Las Vegas. Possibly even the best spot I've been to ever.   We ordered the Don pizza. The marinara had the freshest tasting herbs The brick oven baked crust was perfectly crunchy. The toppings were heavily  placed on the pizza. Quality mozzarella cheese covered any void area of the pizza.   We also ordered a caesar salad. It was delicious as well.   Might just have to stay closer to Palazzo next time in Vegas. For added convenience of ordering this amazing pizza!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I can have pizza minus the airfare to NY! The cheese is a tad bit saltier than the usual pizza chains, but that's what mozzarella really taste like kids! I'm so glad I can have NY pizza again."}
{"text":"I grew up in NYC. I am still getting over the shock that there is more than one Grimaldi's... And that the other ones are in places like Arizona and Texas.   It is not as good as NY but this may be the best NY style pizza I've had outside of NYC.  Which is not to say that it was fantastic pizza. The sauce and cheese are top notch. Simply fantastic. But the crust is what failed me. Not enough salt and too tough.  But hey- you can't make amazing NY pizza outside NY.   It puts places like Flour+Water and Delfina to shame. The pizza is just as good, if not better, and Grimaldi's is far less pretentious!  I wish this was in SF or at least the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in Las Vegas! My favorite location(and I've been to everyone in LV) is Eastern, especially because of Andrea. She's excellent at making sure you are taken care of, and always happy! Thank you Grimaldi's & team"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is GREAT pizza! This is by far my favorite pizza hands down!! I love to fold it in half and go for it! However my family does prefer thin crust pizza. If you are a Chicago style pizza lover, this may not be the pizza for you.  We always get our pizza with pepperoni, garlic and onions and then ask for it  well done. We usually order one to eat there and one to take home, because it's just as good, if not better leftover the next day!  The outside patio seating is great for the kids and so is the pizza dough that they bring out for them to play with.  We have done many family birthdays here with quite a few people, and every time, even though they don't always have a lot of floor space for all of the people that we bring in, they are always accommodating. (The Eastern and Serene location has a separate room for larger parties, which is easier. )   Despite another review below,  your pizza does include cheese in the base price. They only charge for cheese if you are ordering extra cheese. Also, ricotta cheese is not the standard cheese that your pizza comes with, that is an extra topping that you can order. They use fresh mozzarella on their pizzas. So I think it's kind of funny that this reviewer felt their intelligence was being insulted about having to pay for cheese, when in fact they had it all wrong to begin with!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and very good service. We came in on a busy night. We were really impressed with the way the host staff had set low expectations forecasting a 30 minute wait, and we were seated in 10 minutes.   The pizza came out perfect....again, in 15 minutes when we were expecting a 30 minute timeframe.   Pizza ingredients are robust and high quality, and they don't go chintzy with the amount of toppings."}
{"text":"The limoncello margarita was incredible! I'm going to try to make my own very soon, because it was so refreshing. The Greek salad was real good too and the small size is enough for two people to share."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Kinda pricy for pizza but we expected it given the location. We got half pepperoni and half ham/fresh tomatoes along with a garden salad.   The garden salad fed 4 easily. I really enjoyed the cruft and the meat toppings were really good. It appeared they had alternate and sauce choices, but we just went old fashioned.  The pizza was very good- especially the crust.   Service was very friendly and natural. The niceness seemed natural and not forced for a tip. Atmosphere was also great and, in an area that doesn't necessarily seem to welcoming for children, we appreciated their attentiveness towards ours."}
{"text":"Still the best pizza in town.  If we need a splurge meal, it is tops on our list."}
{"text":"OK, so I was talking up Grimaldi's given I visited the one under the Brooklyn Bridge last summer and was blown away by their pizza. A buddy of mine from back east (Philly) was visiting and I told him that there's a Grimaldi's off Eastern and 215 in Las Vegas. We visited the place last night around 5:30PM.  We ordered an 18\" light sauce pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni and mushrooms. We waited 15 minutes and the pie appeared. We were starving so we dug in. My bud says...\"so where's the extra chesse\"? and he was right. Not only was there NO extra cheese, there practically NO cheese on the pizza. I called over our waitress she brought over the order slip and sure enough she ordered extra cheese/light sauce.   English must be a second language for the oven/kitchen staff. Our waitress sent over the Manager and he apologized and said ....\"don't worry, I'll take care of this\" while holding the bill. We said great! We tipped our waitress and started to walk out when the Manager said...oh, wait guys, you still have to pay for half of the pie.  Will somebody PLEASE tell this guy when you say....\"I'm gonna take care of this (bill)\" it means the whole bill ......not HALF.  We did get a $5 voucher for a future visit and so I will return and hope for a better outcome.  July 3rd UPDATE!!! Visited the Grimaldi's on Rampart; tried to use the $5 voucher, and.......wait for it.......the voucher date expired three months ago. Yup, the manager gave us an expired voucher. All in all I'm gonna pass on any Grimaldi's Pizza in Las Vegas and wait until I get back to Brooklyn."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food! The Caldone's are the best! Bruschetta was fantastic. So fresh! My only complaint is that while we were waiting for our outdoor table they gave our table to someone else, but they more than made up for it by getting us seated quickly and brought us the bruschetta quickly. The Caldone is made fresh so it took a little longer, but was worth the wait. The Pesto pizza was just perfect too. Love this place. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We visited Las Vegas in August and happened into Grimaldi's for the first time.  We were impressed with everything!  The food and service were the best we've had in Las Vegas in a long time (in a casual setting).  The staff was genuinely welcoming and engaged, and the general manager, Fred, even came over to our table when we had a question with the wine.  The pizza and salads were so good that we ate at the restaurant a second time before we left town.  We really appreciated having a good meal late -- many of the nice restaurants don't serve after 11 pm on the weekends, and we didn't even pop in until about that time.  This restaurant is on our short list for next time we visit Vegas in October.  Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza. Manager Marla(?) was making sure the customers were well taken off."}
{"text":"Third time here the food is amazing but the customer service is very poor. First entered the door and the hostess looks at me and waits for me to say what I needed. I said two with no greeting and says right this way. The staff seems unfriendly and the server never makes conversation at all. As for the server lets just say that the dead has a better personality. We all know the servers work hard for their tip but unfortunately the servers has no personality to even remotely get a tip. So in other words here's a tip loosen up because you are make the customers uncomfortable. The staff in Summerlin is nothing compared to this type of service provided. Servers are snobbish to the bussers. Management should really improve this type of environment."}
{"text":"I'm a Pizza Nazi. There are very few pizza places I actually approve of. Give me real NY pizza or give me death.  Can I tell you how happy it makes me to live 5 minutes from Grimaldi's? This is real NY pizza cooked in a coal fire oven. What more can you ask for?  But there's more. Great atmosphere, excellent service, decent wine. And it's inexpensive. Oh, and don't miss the frozen custard place right next door for dessert."}
{"text":"We love this place. The general manager is the nicest man. Pizza is fantastic. I also love the Caprese salad. Everything is made to order and very fresh."}
{"text":"Excellent food but they are unorganized when it comes to providing their food in an efficient manner. Was quoted to pick up a pizza in 20 mins and it wasn't ready until 50 mins (30 mins after the time quoted). I dont mind waiting 50 mins for excellent food but I'd rather be prepared for it when they tell me to arrive 20 mins after I placed an order."}
{"text":"When I visited the Brooklyn location, I though it was the best pizza I've ever had--light, crispy, burn marks on the edges, thin disks of mozzerella. Simple oil and tomato sauce allows the quality ingredients to show through. I cannot tell the difference at the Henderson location.  The vibe outside on the patio is sublime--sitting in the western sun, eating authentic NYC pizza, drinking a Peroni pitcher and watching my beloved Redskins on a flat screen. Heaven on earth!  I tell all my friends visiting from LA that this is a \"must do\" in Vegas."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. The taste, the crust the ambiance you simply can't go wrong. This is on par or better than the one in NY. If your looking for authentic NY Pizza you need to stop by. We had the amazing meatlovers and it wasnt greasy and the crust was perfect. The bottles of wine are a reasonable price as well."}
{"text":"If you looking for excellent NYC style pizza and large amazing salads, this is the place!  The pizza comes in 3 sizes. There was 2 of us and we ordered the largest one and split it, and had 2 slices left over. But we were really hungry! The large can definitely feed 3 people!  The salads come in small or large. We ordered a small caesar salad which was enough for the 2 of us to share. The leaves were crisp and the dressing was awesome..not overflooding the salad.. it was just right!   We chose the Margherita pizza (requested it well done) which comes with basil and tomato, mozzarella cheese and excellent tomato sauce and we added 3 toppings to it...spinach, mushrooms and roasted red peppers, and all I can say is we can't wait to go back to that place again for the same pizza."}
{"text":"Good foods, yummy. But server is not caring. She brought spoon with salad.. and the place wasn't busy I think had 4 tables with us."}
{"text":"Love this place. Some of the best pizza in Vegas.  Was surprised good pizza is hard to find in Vegas. They use water similar to NY water to make the crust, makes a big difference.  They also offer gluten free pizza in a 12 in pie.  I had the sausage and green peppers with extra mozzarella and it was yummy. Gluten free crust sucks, let's not kid, but if you have a good topping, it makes it tolerable. They have one of my favorite GF pizzas. Wife had a salami and black olive regular pizza with extra mozzarella and it was yummy. Salami is not on the list of toppings but they will put on the pizza if you ask.  Started with a small house salad, and it's enough for 2 to share. Comes with a mild house dressing, roasted red peppers and the usual salad things. Overall a nice meal, good service and highly recommended"}
{"text":"We loved our dining experience at Grimaldi's I had heard good things about this establishment from fellow yelpers and number it's friends so I was very excited, especially since we were craving pizza and opted for somewhere different... Parking might be a hassle however we were able to find a small spot in the back lot... Located to the west of the building... Glad my car is small because the parking spaces are very tight and close... Entrance to Grimaldi's is on the Scottsdale road side and one you walk in the hosts are to your right... It was a fairly crowded spot for a Friday evening but we were seated in a matter of seconds... A nice little table was open adjacent to the kitchen... It certainly added to the experience as we were able to see what went on behind the glass... It was exciting to see the dough being made, the dough being tossed, and the dough being covered in Uber deliciousness...   Our server Chelsea was fabulous... She asked if we had dined at Grimaldi's before and when we informed her that we hadn't, she informed us on the history, the favorites, and the wine list... She seemed to have several tables to cover in her section but she was always there to refill our drinks and helped us when we needed something  We started off with the house salad and they were excellent... The vinaigrette dressing was divine... As for our pizza... We split a large one in half and it was the perfect amount for 2 people... On one half we had just cheese  And on the other we had pepperoni Both were amazing and we loved the thin crust, succulent sauce, and the fresh toppings...   The entire ambience of the restaurant was fun and really added into our great experience... From the red checkered table covers to the sounds of the working kitchen... Grimaldi's is a hit in our books!"}
{"text":"So it's Easter Sunday, and we've been to a play in Cave Creek.  We stop at Grimaldi's.  The waitress has a very canned spiel--immediately asks us where we are from.  When we say local, she says, oh, so you havent 'ventured out' to Grimaldi's before.  Wow.  Like an overpriced pizza chain is so exotic. Then she said it was real Italian pizza! We had a Don pizza--toppings ok, but the crust was gummy and cardboardy and all the toppings fell off if you used a knife and fork, which I did since the pieces were twice normal size.  We had a trio of cheesecakes for dessert, which according to the waitress were made that day.  Average.  Better pizza lots of other places, and the pizza in Italy is not so gummy.  Once was enough."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and it was delish, the spinach salad was so fresh and great dressing and my hubby loved the pizza, nice thin crust not greasy. Service was spot on also. YUM YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I really liked pizza, but since I've done reviews of around 10 pizza places, apparently I do. This one (and its branches at other locations) is the best in the Valley; maybe the best one I've ever visited.  Grimaldi's pizza is fresh, crispy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The crusts are all thin, and the sauce is rich but not too sweet. I believe all the ingredients are home-made (I've been told that's true of the pepperoni and cheese too, but even if it's not, the quality is outstanding). They cook the pizzas in a wood oven, and they will get spots of char black on them, but even those are delicious.  My favorite is the pepperoni. They add the sauce on top of the cheese, but it's not too wet -- you could lift a whole slice without it drooping. I've had and enjoyed the sausage, but here the pepperoni is king.  Grimaldi's also has several salads, built in generous portions. Two adults can share a small salad and still have room for pizza. The Mediterranean salad is outstanding, with black olives, tomatoes, and feta in a creamy vinaigrette dressing. I also like the Caprese, but don't get it often since Brak would rather have something with lettuce and not so many tomatoes. The house salad is also good, but doesn't beat the other two.  Plan for a wait at this location, unless you arrive at an odd hour. They can accommodate groups, but you'll have to call ahead. It's not uncommon for us to have to wait 30 or more minutes for a table for two even on a week night, but it's worth the wait, and there is plenty to walk around and see on the side streets.  Parking is plentiful in the lot south of Dillards. The bathrooms are clean, there is outdoor seating if you want it, and overall Grimaldi's is a great experience."}
{"text":"Oh Grimaldi's you never disappoint do you.    This was my first visit to the Grimaldi's located in DC Ranch.  I didn't expect anything different from this location.  The pizza was superb and the service was great.  Our waiter was almost too attentive to our needs at times, but I'm not sure if that's a bad thing.  The pizza came out very quickly within 10 minutes of placing the order.  Pepperoni and Jalapeno all the way all day everyday!  The location was a bit of a ghost town though.  There were a lot of \"available for lease\" buildings all over the place.  I'm not sure what happened, but it's a shame, because the location is great and has the potential."}
{"text":"Once again Grimaldi's never disappoints me.  I always order the pepperoni and jalapeno and it's delicious every time.  The location is great and the service was great.  Everything was right on time and the pizza was fresh and hot out of the oven."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Gilbert, AZ by far!  I go here at least once a week to get my fix.  I don't know if it's the coal or the sauce, but everything comes together for a fantastic tasting pie.  I've been to the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn me I'd rather have it here in AZ than there.  Pepperoni and jalapeño is the way to go.  It never fails me and I love it every time I order it. Staff is great and atmosphere is also good."}
{"text":"All the pizzas I have had there were delicious.  They are all \"build your own\".  I really wish they had at least a few pre-built options to choose from for those days where I don't feel like being a chef.  -1 star for their sangrias.  Had a red and a white one.  Neither was very good."}
{"text":"O.k., it's in a mall and pizza was not the greatest in the world, but this place exceeded my expectations.  FIrst, service was great.  Went there with 4 kids, and very friendly and competent waiter brought them small rounds of dough with a pizza pan.  What a great, simple idea.  The dough occupied all children (ages 3-9) the entire meal.  THey made fake pies, desserts, etc.  Next, I could not choose between two white wines and waiter described them like he knew them and then offered me a taste of each. Wow.  Again, very simple and inexpensive for the restaurant, but meant so much to me.  They won me over at this point.  Again, when I was thinking of a red wine to have with pizza, he gave me a taste of a delicious blend from Paso Robles.  Pizzas were good.  We had two, both with red sauce.  One with sausage, the other with meatballs, ricotta and garlic on half, the other half being olives and mushrooms.  Tasty and fresh.  Sauce is a little sweet and not herbified with oregano or thyme.  People can endlessly argue about pizza styles, sauce, etc., and I am one them, and, I can say a sweeter sauce is usually not my style, but I found the sauce pretty good.  The crust was a littler thicker then I expected, but was cooked until dark and crispy.  Overall a B+ pizza.  The garden salad was $5 and was fresh and big enough for me and my two kids.  I did not eat dessert, but friends said cheesecake very good.  This is a solid place with great customer service."}
{"text":"I am kinda torn on the pizza I recently got here, there were both high points and low points.  On one hand, I got a really flavorful sausage pizza. I could taste each of the four components of my pizza. The sausage was moist and not greasy with good seasoning. The cheese wasn't just plain mozzarella, it had some extra herbs or seasonings, it had a interesting mellow flavor with a little \"extra\". The sauce was wasn't acidic but still had a good taste of tomatoe. The crust was thin with a good chew, it had the perfect thickness.  On the other hand, it wasn't that filling. For being a large pizza, it was less filling than the Naples style pizza that I have tried, which tend to be meant for one person.   I also got a canoli. The pastry part was fried too hard. The cream was on point, it was creamy without being overly sweet.  I'll come here again, even though the price point to \"getting full\" ratio is a little off here. Also since I took the pizza to-go and didn't get to taste it right out the oven."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Grimaldi's. I was looking forward to trying you!! I think that Grimaldi's is a solid pizza joint if you are someone that is into the thin crust. I love doughy chewy pizza crust so I was a little caught off guard by the crispy crust.   I found that the food here is really good but the service is really lacking, hence my three star review. I was found numerous times in my dining experience with empty water and beer and wine glasses that were waiting to be refilled.   ***Do NOT come here after 3:45pm-4:30pm or you won't be able to get any pizza!! I guess at this time, all Grimaldi's locations shut down the pizza oven to work some magic with the coals and what not."}
{"text":"Horrible experience first time at this location and the fire alarm went off and they couldn't figure out how turn it off and if was annoying"}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff. Got seated and the server came and said its take out only. UNPROFESSIONAL  Dont seat your guest and then say its take out only."}
{"text":"We've been going to Grimaldi's for many years. Love their pizza, but the last 2 times  the pizza has been soggy. Not sure what happened to cause this. The first time it happended we thought it was just a fluke but this time it happened again.  We would've sent it back but figured it wasn't worth the hassle. We ended up with a horrible waiter. Started out having to wait    about 10 mins. to place our drink order. After we got our drinks we placed our order for a Caesar salad. Waiter asked if we'd like fresh ground cracked pepper, we said yes, we waited and waited, he never came back. Not the end of the world but it is nice to have with your salad. The Caesar salad was delicious as always, nice crisp romaine lettuce with a wonderful dressing, shaved Parmesan cheese, and croutons. The waiter finally returned and we gave him our pizza order.  Pizza was delivered to the table, we weren't given new plates for the pizza. Had to use the ones from the Caesar salad. Pizza was disappointing, soggy crust again. The server never came back to see how our pizza was or we would've sent it back. He was actually nowhere to be found.  Obviously they are having issues with their pizza crust because a table near us sent theirs back because of the crust being too soggy. Not sure what's going on.  We won't be going back. It's too bad because this was our favorite pizza spot."}
{"text":"Food is always great. We usually get take out. This is my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas. A little pricier then most but the food is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's and met the owner once. He's a super nice guy and local to Phoenix.  The calzones are amazing and customized."}
{"text":"Wow cool place!  Indoor/outdoor setting.  Great wine, great pizza.  I've had this bookmarked for a while now and I'm glad I stopped by"}
{"text":"I looove Grimaldis. It's the best pizza in Scottsdale (IMO).  The only drawback is the costly toppings-- if you want a well-adorned pizza, be prepared to see the bill rack up quick!!  The salads are awesome with the perfect amount of dressing, the crust and pizza sauce is spot on! Not to mention their AMAZING Birthday deal--free pizza with 1 topping for your birthday! They don't even care much about the expiration date as long as it's within the month (they barely even check).  Service is awesome and I love the location. No reason not to stop by every time I'm back at home! YUM!"}
{"text":"My friends were eating here before we'd planned to meet, and since they weren't finished when I arrived, I pulled up a chair & ordered a sangria. It had such a wonderful, sweet flavor, with lots of fruit - like dessert! So much so that my friend ordered a sangria for herself after tasting mine.  Their server took my order almost immediately, brought me a water, and even asked if my drink would be on the table's check or if I'd like my own. We were ready to go before we'd finished our sangrias, so our server offered to put them in to-go cups - oh, how I love Vegas. For the next hour or so, as I finished my drink, other people at our convention kept asking me where they could get such a fruit-filled sangria... It still looked fabulous in a plastic cup!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Grimaldi's in Old Town, which is also really good. We stopped in here on a Saturday afternoon; I was in a bit of a rush-I had a spa appointment, so we really didn't have the time to sit and wait a long time. We sat outside with our daughter-the patio is nice. It's on a corner, so you have some mountain views. The service was very slow-I don't know that it's a negative here. It's great for chatting, and just hanging out, which seems like all the groups on the patio had the time to do. I was in kind of a rush, so..ugh, I wish it had been a tad faster. Food was great..we had a small half chicken and half regular pizza. It was really good and large enough for the 3 of us to share. We'll definitely go back when we have more time to relax and enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"Another visit and this place never disappoints.   Love their pizza and we had the blueberry cheesecake tonight and it was amazing.   Thank you."}
{"text":"This is the first time Ive been here. We loved it!! The pizza was excellent with fresh ingredients. The personal size calzone was ginormous! It literally fed the 4 of us, we could not even finish half the pizza. The caesar salad with chicken is very good too. Our server was very attentive. We will definitely go back here when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"Always count on Grimaldis for the best pie in town. Fresh pizza cold beer and top shelf antipasto  Trust me you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"How about teaching your cooks to 1) clean the oven properly 2) don't burn the pizza. I understand it's a coal burning oven but dry and burnt on the bottom is not how this pizza is supposed to be. I should have uploaded a picture but I'd rather just say F**K this place."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and our Server Lindsay was awesome , smiling and made us feel at home. She had to serve us outside but did it with a smile!!!!! You guys are lucky to have her.   Thanks for the great food. !"}
{"text":"I'm a pizza freak first of all and wood fired pizza from here is the best!  The only complaint is no ranch dressing :/"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise so close to home. The service was outstanding, the pizza was superb. The crust wad a perfect texture topped with freshness. I can't wait to try more items. I highly recomend."}
{"text":"First, let me say we've been eating at Grimaldi's for years.   I've avoided writing a review the past few times we've been even though it's been marginal because I figured \"everyone has a bad night.\" Well, our experience this afternoon was so awful, that I can't refrain from writing this review.  The hostesses are so snotty that we've commented about it the past several times.  Where to begin?  We arrived at 3 pm thinking we would have an early dinner before the ovens close for cleaning between 3:30 and 5:00 pm (per the hostess when I called).  Upon arriving, the hostesses were not just unfriendly but downright rude.  I said we needed a table for 5 and she was visibly irritated.  Her words \"oh my god, there are just so many big parties coming in at once.\"  First of all, it's not my problem that several \"big\" parties came in around the time we did.  Also, is 5 people really a \"big\" party?  Having 5 people always seems problematic at this particular Grimaldis which is why we've tried on several occasions to make a reservation up to a week in advance and have been told every time that they are full for reservations.     After a less than warm reception, the wait was as predicted and we were seated.  The waitress was friendly and our drink orders taken.  Once food orders were taken, salad plates were brought to our table.  Mine came with a long thick black hair on it  (I'm blonde) .  I told our waitress at which time it was replaced without any comment or apology.  Our pizza was great, but as is usual at Grimaldis. It was brought out by someone who was not our server.  We would have liked to order another beer, as ours were empty, but we didn't see our server until we were just finishing our pizza.  She did ask us at that time if we'd like desert and another beer, but by that time we were done with our pizza and beer and cheesecake....no thanks.  We waited for 15 minutes for the slice of cheesecake which was good.    On our way out the door we passed the hostess station where 4 employees were gathered talking and laughing and not one of the even looked up or said anything to us.    I have to say that overall, the food is good, but the service is hit or miss, and the hostesses are just snotty and unfriendly.  We eat here at least 2-3 times a month and our bill is always over $100, so this is not a cheep dinner and the service used to be friendlier.  I'm wondering if the manager has any clue how people are greeted and treated by these young ladies.  They are the fist and last impression the customer has when dining at Grimaldis.  Maybe management doesn't think it matters because the restaurant is always packed, but in the future we will either drive to the Scottsdale Grimaldis or look for a different pizza place we can call our favorite.y"}
{"text":"This place has the full package! The best pizza in Vegas (Roccos is up there too)  and service! When it comes to pizza, I stick with the basics cheese or pepperoni (the way it was intended).  We come here many times and will continue."}
{"text":"How Lucky Can One Guy Be....I Kissed Her and She Kissed Me...Like the Fella Once Said...Ain't That a Kick in the Head...  2,500 miles away from the original location under the Brooklyn Bridge and I walk in to Dean Martin singing with the smells of pizza cooking.  That's Vegas baby.  Truth is, nothing can replicate the smell of walking into the original Grimaldi's.  There it almost knocks you down, and I'm not kidding.  Perhaps it's that you have to wait outside in line to get a seat, weather be damned.  You earn your pizza there.  But here on a Saturday night at 7 pm we walked right in.  More proof that people have to get away from the strip to enjoy some great food.  I love that they kept the pizza prep area the same as the original Grimaldi's - a square work area with a coal brick oven taking up the back wall.  Open to the restaurant so you can sit there and watch them put on a little show and fantasize if that that's your pizza they are working on or not.  They start with hand tossing the dough here, which is becoming a lost art, because I'm seeing more and more press machines being used for dough.  Then some of their signature tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella.  The fresh mozzarella is the key here.  It's slices rather than shredded.  I noted in my review at the original Grimaldi's that they deal the mozzarella like playing cards all over the pizza.  Well even though it's Vegas and that analogy works better here, they were a lot slower and each slice was more carefully placed on the pie.  I guess in New York they've made so many pizza's that those guys can make 'em in their sleep.  This location is fairly new, so you can't expect them to be working at that speed yet.  We ordered a pie with a whole lot of toppings and each was excellent except the shredded fresh basil.  Unfortunately they put the basil on when they are cooking the pie and the result was burnt leaves on the pizza.  So if you are going to order basil, make sure you ask for it to be added after the pie is cooked.  The pepperoni had a nice spice to it.  The meatballs were sliced real thin and had so much flavor.  The sausage was crumbled, and while I prefer sliced sausage on my NY pie, this is good stuff and you won't be disappointed.  The onions and mushrooms were sliced thin enough to totally cook on the pie.  The roasted red peppers were a little different than the original Grimaldi's, they were chopped up into smaller pieces, which I think was a good thing.  That way you got a little taste of the marinated red peppers in each bite.  Now the problem with getting a lot of toppings here is you really pay for it.  Toppings are $2 each with a few being $4.  We had $18 in toppings!!!.  Oh well, we're on vacation, but if you eat here regularly you might have to make choices of what you want on your pie.  I remember the same thing happened in New York, I got the bill for 2 and it was like $50.  For pizza.  LOL But so good!  The only thing I didn't think was quite as good as the Original Grimaldi's was the dough.  I don't know what it is, but once you stop using that New York drinking water for your dough, it's never the same.  But we ain't in New York, and this is still a 5 star pie."}
{"text":"If you can't beat 'em join 'em.  Grimaldi's has been kicking the pepperoni out of all the strip fancy shmancy pizza places since they opened in Vegas a few years ago.  From it's original location under the Brooklyn Bridge (which I've been to), this New Yorker ain't gonna take no guff from some high end mega resort.  They are running the show and this isn't a diluted Grimaldi's Pizza, it's the real deal.    Located in the Shoppes at the Palazzo, now you don't have to venture off the strip for a Grimaldi's pizza (if you don't want to).  Prices actually seemed to be pretty close to other Grimaldi's locations.  Not to say this is a cheap pie, you get what you pay for and adding toppings gets expensive quick.  Problem is they are all so good, it's hard to not add them.  Went with Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, Mushroom, Onion, Roasted Sweet Red Peppers, and fresh Basil.  My biggest complaint with Grimaldi's has always been the basil.  It just gets charred up in the coal fired oven and you lose the flavor of it as it's replaced with a burnt taste.  Lombardi's Pizza in New York adds the basil after the pie is cooked, so this time I had Grimaldi's do that and I liked it a lot better.  Perhaps there was too much basil on the pie and it would have been better shredded a little finer, but it still was a nice topping, and I recommend you order it that way.  Also don't dismiss the meatballs as a topping, they are really good and have lots of flavor.  The pepperoni and sausage provided some spice.  The cheese is fresh mozzarella and very rich.  I can assure you this will be one of the best pies you've had.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=XqdLYxc2ln60eNNNZ4NOmw#XqdLYxc2ln60eNNNZ4NOmw  We also were very happy with our Caesar Salad.  Nothing super special, but tasty.  It's easy to go meal after meal in Vegas realizing you haven't eaten anything green in a while.  We ordered the large and it was plenty enough for 4 adults to share.  Considering how good their dough is, I'm very interested in trying a calzone on another trip.  Saw a few people eating them and they looked to be a good size.  If you are staying at the Palazzo, Grimaldi's will be hard to avoid since you will keep getting wafts of pizza in the hallways and elevators as people get it to go and head up to their rooms."}
{"text":"We have one in Clearwater, so I was happy to see this chain out here in Vegas too!    The scent alone is like perfume from the heavens, heady with tomato and garlic, it draws you in.  And when the food is placed before you, you see that it's all fresh prepared, that the Mozz cheese is both decadent and delicate, that it's not something you've ever tasted before.   The crust is light, thin enough to hold everything in, but not thick enough to get in the way. Not too crispy either, it was -just- right.   I am a serious fan of Grimaldi's Pizza!"}
{"text":"Ate here before a movie the other night with my hubby & daughter. We've been here numerous times before and are always pleased! If you call in advance, they take reservations for larger groups and are very accommodating. Caprese salad is awesome! And what to say about their amazing pizza .... I have cravings for their delicious crust often. Although the crust is thin, it will fill you up perfectly. Oreo cheesecake is phenomenal. Beer selection is great which is very important to me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in Scottsdale/Phoenix Metro.  We usually get the traditional thin crust pizza with sliced meatballs, roasted red peppers, and fresh basil.  Delicious!  And we always start with a Caesar salad, also delicious.  The service is almost always very good.  The white pizza, which has extra cheese and lots of garlic instead of red sauce, can be nice for a change."}
{"text":"Wow. I expected so much better from this NY staple.  Ordered a small Pepperoni/Jalapeno/Garlic extra crispy. What came out was a soggy mess which I force-fed myself like a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay.  What part of extra crispy did homeboy didn't understand? They use fresh mozarella chunks which hold a lot of water and the jalapenos weren't dried out enough is my guess.  This place makes Pizza Hut look like Gary Danko's.  I won't bother ever going here again.   2 stars only because our server was cool."}
{"text":"This pizza is excellent. I've been here a couple of times and have never been disappointed. They have an assortment of pizzas, calzones, and salads. I've never tried their calzones but every time I come here I just happen to sit next to someone who orders one so I get a glimpse from the corner of my eye and they look pretty good. As far as the service, waiters/waitresses are prompt and attentive. Never have any issues! Only giving 4 stars because I wish they offered more on the menu. Maybe bread or breadsticks and some pasta."}
{"text":"Sat on the counter and order an individual marguerita pizza, with extra ricotta. The pizza is spectacular, soooooo thin and light, I devoured the whole thing and did not feel like I ate a ton. Cheese was so perfect portioned and the ricotta added an extra level of richness and creaminess to every bite. Service is extremely friendly and attentive. This place makes for a really great meal for an unbeatable price for Vegas standards. Def worth the try!"}
{"text":"This place was good. I got the calzone in small with garlic, pepperoni, sausage and mozarella cheese. Others in my group got personal sized pizzas and said they enjoyed this location better to the New York and Manhattan beach one."}
{"text":"Pizza was very Neapolitan: non-oily, thin and tasty. Crust was nice, but too oil-less for my taste.  Weren't greeted by hostess. Tables are too tiny, too many tables and customers. Waiters weren't very caring and kept arrogant look on. Also, no goodbye notice from hostesses.  Atmosphere would've been nice if not too crowded tables. Cacophony of people at the tables talking made impossible for music be heard. It was nice that there were no TVs at the seating area, don't remember the bar."}
{"text":"Terrific pizza place located right in the heart of Old Scottsdale. Quality customer service and a really good product. Varied menu, pizza along with their Italian dishes. Elected to go with pizza after a long day of spring training baseball, glad that I did. Had a tasty kake salad for a starter, then dig into a sausage and basil traditional pizza that was exceptional. Perfectly cooked, served hot, with a pizza stand for easy access and also keeps room on the table. They have both inside and outside seating, and I enjoyed sitting outside and people watching! Server Kris was outstanding! Plenty of street parking. Will absolutely return."}
{"text":"This is by far the most bland pizza I have ever had. The red sauce tastes like they forgot to season it, the crust is flavorless too. The pizza oven must be filthy as well because the bottom of the pizza had bits of black crunchy residue, big enough to get caught in my teeth and to stain our 2yr olds plate with black grease. Our 7 and 10 yr old that love all pizza ate only 1/2 a piece and declined more.   Their menu is so slim it makes you wonder why they don't literally have anything besides pizza and salad, no appetizers at all. My other issue is that if you choose 1/2 a pizza with toppings you still get charged for toppings for a whole pizza. Insane! 2 small pizzas and 3 drinks cost over $50, WOW!  If you are in the mood for pizza skip this place and head up the street to Oreganos for their thin bistro pizza or even over to NYPD down the street for thicker styled pizza. Both places have way more flavorful pizza than this place and appetizers to boot."}
{"text":"We were at Fashion Show mall and looking for a place to eat.  We were thinking about CPK, but there was a 15 minutes wait.   I saw a lot of tables open, not sure why they couldn't sit us.  Probably because certain sections aren't open.  We walked around while we wait and saw this Pizzeria.  There wasn't a wait.  We were seated right away.    We ordered two single pizzas.  Margherita 12\" and Quattro Formaggi 12\".  We love them both.  I preferred the Margherita and my husband liked the Quattro Formaggi better.  Worked out for us.  A single 12\" is a good amount, we both were super stuffed and didn't want to take the slices togo, so we forces it down.  LOL  There was one incident that happened that I wish there was a way our server should have dealt with this issue.  We were seated about 15-20 minutes before these two couple who were seated right next to us in the front patio area.  The couple was in their 50-60s(not good looking at all), super PDA type of couple, touching and making out at the table at 2 PM.  The lady kept saying to her guy why are you sitting so far away about 10 times until she decided to move her seat over to sit next to him.  Which her seat was touching our table and she kept shaking our table since she can't sit still.  From the way she's sitting, it's a fire hazard for me since there isn't a path for me to walk out of the restaurant if something happened.  The server should had moved them or asked the lady to move her seat back where it belong.  My husband and I were super uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Placed a really large order that contained 2 gluten free pizzas with no cheese. The 2 gluten free pizzas were wrong they did have cheese on them. So then we had to wait for them to make 2 new pizzas and the other pizzas got cold and were only credited for one of the pizzas on their mistake. FYI-if you're looking for a good gluten free crust this is not it-its not good and wayyyy overpriced."}
{"text":"The pesto pizza is delish. Fresh ingredients.  One of my fav pizza places ever."}
{"text":"Well, as predicted, we didn't stay at the Palazzo but we ate here 3 times. Good food and atmosphere.  When I'm at home and cooking in my pizza oven, Grimaldi's is my comparison pizza for taste.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner Grimaldi's thin crust coal brick oven pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"I did a build my own with tons of veggies. Crust & sauce were PERFECT.   Not much else to say. It's a straightforward, unfooled around with Pizza joint."}
{"text":"Love Grimaldi's! Awesome pizza, wonderful service, good drinks and fair prices. Highly recommend if you're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Both my daughters love this place so I finally tried it! The pizza was really good, not my favorite but good. The salad is good but when they charge you extra to put salami on it, they should put salami! 6 little slivers is not worth the uncharge. The pizza is what you come for though and we had pepperoni and sausage and it was cheesy and greasy and exactly what you want from New York style pizza. Service was good, relaxed nice atmosphere, and yummy garlic powder to add to the pizza! Glad I finally tried it, I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Had a pepperoni pizza and my wife had a margarita calzone (not on the menu).   Both agreed they were the best we have ever had. Be prepared for a ton of food. Personal pizzas are 12'' which is 6 full size slices.   Waitress Samantha was awesome and service was quick. Only complaint we have is the fact there are none where we live! Can't wait to get this pizza again."}
{"text":"This is more like a 3.5* rating for food when compared with the Brooklyn Grimaldi's but the excellent service made me bump it up to 4. Went here for dinner on a recent trip to las vegas. This is located in the Venetian hotel, but is on the second floor (I think), and we took a while to find it. Better to ask for directions rather than roam around trying to find it yourself.   It is decorated a little differently from the NYC locations, but it has the traditional feel of an italian pizzeria. They also have sort of an outside seating as well, which gives a pseudo-patio feeling. They have some ny based props like subway signs hanging around, and is brightly lit. The place is reasonably large, but generally is pretty crowded. We saw a lot of families dining there.  It took us 20 minutes to be seated after getting there at 7 on a Saturday night, pretty reasonably for a weekend dinner. Once seated, service was prompt and attentive. Our server was very jolly and friendly. He made good conversation and suggestions.   We got a bottle of wine to share, and all the different bruschetta to start off. I really liked the mushroom one, but all of them were great. We got three different pizzas to share, one pepperoni, one chicken, and one vegetarian. All of them were really good, but again, not as good as its original locations.  The pizzas are huge. The smallest personal one can easily be shared by two, unless you've not eaten the entire day. The large pizzas are more suited for 5 people. We had to box much of our pizzas, which were useful the next morning.  The prices are very reasonable, and of excellent value here. Since portions are large, it's great to share.  Definitely recommend this to everyone for some great pizza and good atmosphere for dinner, if you want to avoid the fancy restaurants and bars, or are with family. It's not an intimate or classy place, but again, it's just an informal pizzeria."}
{"text":"WAY overrated.  Bland bland bland.  Asked for extra cheese and I couldn't tell the difference.  Servers are pre-programmed with no real zeal for the function.  Yes the crust was thin, but it was too \"crunchy\" aka overdone.  Don't understand the hype.  This was the Palazzo location."}
{"text":"Service 5 Food 4 Cleanliness 5 Atmosphere 4 Value 3  Pros: Friendly Staff Quality Pizza  Cons: Wait No Reservations Pricey  Been trying to go here for a long time but the fact that you can't make reservations and the wait time on weekends is usually insane has kept me away. Got here 7:30 Sunday and got seated right away. Went with some friends who had been here before so trusted their suggestions.   Don't overload your pizza here there is no need. Pick 2 things and let the ingredients do their thing.  My brain didn't process until just now how pricey this actually was. A large pizza, shared large salad, two waters, two sodas $43 whoa?!? But whatever good food is what it is.   Onto The Food!  White Pizza: We went with Italian sausage and roasted red peppers. Liked the sausage, was sliced whole verses crumbled. Mass amounts of garlic on this pizza which I'm fine with. Donno how I would feel about taking a date here. One thing I didn't like was the garlic was the jarred variety, you can tell by the slight vinegary flavor. The mozzarella was a dry variety but kept the pizza from getting soggy, points for that. Olive oil was smokey, nutty, strong and EVO I'm sure. The roasted red peppers were light and very sweet.   Mediterranean Salad: Yep.. this was a salad :p Nothing super special but it did the job."}
{"text":"A while ago my friends and I stopped by here for the very first time and I can't recall what we ordered but it was a thin crust pizza. The crust was crispy but not hard to where it tasted like cardboard. The ingredients tasted fresh and the pizza itself had tons of flavor! I loved it!   A week later, another girlfriend of mine and I wanted to go somewhere to eat. Me being a pizza freak, I suggested pizza as told her that she had to try this place.  We got there and were seated. As I am sitting I look down at my empty plate and THERE WAS A FREAKING DEAD CRICKET ON IT!!! I was astonished! So we get up to leave; On our way out, we told someone and they said they'd seat us elsewhere! Uhhhh no thank you, you can eat your own insect pizza!  No apology, no nothing!!"}
{"text":"great pizza. great service. worth driving from los angeles for!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Fantastic service! My new favorite Las Vegas food spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza - I've eaten at the real deal in New York and from what I remember the Vegas outpost is nearly spot on. Good wine, fresh salad, and delicious pizza with a very reasonable price tag. Definitely worth a stop on the strip."}
{"text":"i was super excited to see that grimaldi's had opened up in vegas and today i finally got a chance to check it out.   between two people we shared one large pizza. our waitress recommended that we get a small pizza and a salad but we came for pizza and only that.   our pizza was half garlic and half mushrooms + meatball. our pizza came out and it was warm but not piping hot. this was the first thing i noticed. second thing i noticed was the garlic pieces were chopped a little bigger than i wanted. in NY the garlic is finely chopped. but it was still really good. the other half was good but i preferred my half better. the crust was very good. thin and crispy but not like a cracker.   after seeing reviews for the second location on eastern i will check it out and compare the two.   will i be back? yep. but if the other location is better i think it will be worth the drive.   PS. my friend who got the leftovers said it was much better hot and toasted at home. :)"}
{"text":"I went here Aug 13th for my 5oth birthday. I had to get a gluten free pizza for my daughter she love it said it was very good.Nick was our server he did a good job. but I ask for water besides my drink and did not give me a water. But i wills till give it 5 stars. Food was great.I did not have to wait to sit for a sat night that was great."}
{"text":"The garlic white pizza here is amazing!!! Love it!!!   I work close by and always have to order this when I work really late. They have great customer service and takeout is always ready in no longer than 25 minutes! Always order the large garlic white pizza with some pepperoni on there.  Highly recommend! Don't try any other pizza places! This place and Secret Pizza at Cosmo are the BEST!"}
{"text":"Best service and seriously the BEST pizza I've had in years! I highly recommend the white pizza!"}
{"text":"Fabulous thin crust pizza with high quality authentic Italian ingredients.  If you like sauce made with San Marzano tomatoes this place is for you.  Excellent service, salads, pizza and drinks.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had, especially if you like thin crust. Three stars is simply for the price. This place is a budget breaker for sure. $25+ for a pizza... And that's just for pepperoni. They unfortunately charge more per topping. And they don't do by-the-slice, just FYI. I always make the joke that I can only go to this place when my parents are paying... Except its not really a joke. It's definitely worth breaking the budget every once in a while for this pizza."}
{"text":"If you read any of my other reviews, you will notice I frequent NY a lot.  This is the closest thing in Vegas you are going to find to NY pizza.  Henderson locals argue over Settebello and Grimaldi's for top pizza.   Settebello is very unique and great too.  It's not Grimaldi's, which is very similar to Lombardi's in NY.  Grimaldi's is in NY too.  They've come close to maintaining the NY quality 3,000 miles away.  It's not NY but its as close as you will get in Southern Nevada."}
{"text":"For me, Grimaldi's was good. I had a lot of people talk it up so I had really high expectations for my first visit. I enjoyed the food we had but it wasn't (to me) all the hype I was expecting.   The location is really nice and fancy. It's a more formal dining experience. All the staff were nice and service was good.   The menu is pretty much just appetizers, pizza, and calzones. The base price is not bad at about $12 for a standard pizza or calzone. What gets you is the toppings, which average about $4-5 for the common toppings. Getting chicken, pesto, and extra mozzarella costed me about as much as the calzone itself. And at the price for each, I thought it would be a little more fully loaded and packed.   The portions for the calzones were HUGE definitely anything bigger than the 12\" is made to share! The flavors were good but not as bold as I expected. The pizza looked delicious but I thought also lacked boldness. A lot of people love this place, so it May just be my taste preference.   We ordered drinks before. The wine was tasty and we also got a cocktail (all cocktails were $11.) I thought this was a bit on the higher end for the amount received, but the drinks were good.   Overall, the location was fancy and enjoyable. Service was quick and pleasant. The food was good, but I don't think it lived up to the hype and the price. Drinks followed the same as the food, I thought a bit too expensive. I'd recommend it to others, but not as a usual stop."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. The waiter was very attentive. The pizza was delicious but could of used a tiny more spice. I'm used to saltier. I will definitely be back. I love the woodfired pizzas."}
{"text":"Unbelievable..  dining room with people eating pizza inside at half capacity, and the hostess states .... I'm sorry the pizza oven is stoking right now it will be a hour or more for a pizza. I've eaten at other locations and the pizza was delicious. Unfortunately I will have to say customer service is not this location strong suit."}
{"text":"Delicious white sangria & pesto pizza! Quite a few wines to choose from.. & you could build your own pizza. Kinda loud in there, but it was busy! Quick & good service tho :)"}
{"text":"I have experienced many pizzas in my lifetime! East cost pizzas, west coast pizzas, expensive pizza places, deep dish pizzas, fast food pizzas and NOTHING COMPARES to Grimaldi's! Yes it's a major chain pizza company but there is a reason I keep coming back!  Whenever I go, I order the same thing! A large pizza with spicy chicken sausage and ricotta cheese! Those are THEEEE ONLY toppings you need and it'll change your life! Sure pepperonis are good, or meatballs, whatever, the spicy chicken sausage add so much flavor and the ricotta cheese freakin melts in your mouth and fuses with the pizza so well! I don't order anything else and WILL NOT order anything else!   Like I've said before, I've tried deep dish pizzas in Chicago, I've had really authentic pizzas at expensive places such as Pizzaria Bianco in downtown Phoenix, but I feel like it doesn't compare to the pizza that I order at Grimaldis and it's definitely worth the price.   Here are some tips for when you order your pizza  1) get balsamic vinegar and olive oil - I use this to dip my pizza crust in when I'm done with the pizza. It's super good 2) ask for Parmesan cheese, oregano, pepper flakes, garlic powder. Along with the balsamic vinegar and olive oil, you can have some real fun making your pizza a little bit more crazy!  3) spicy chicken sausage and ricotta cheese are the only toppings you need to get! That is all"}
{"text":"Love the size of the pizza, ask the hostess how big it is before you order. The personal size is huge enough to feed two."}
{"text":"Yes I liked it. Despite my apprehension with the idea that an institution such as Grimaldi's is now a chain, with locations over five or six states, I still like it. It is not as good as some other pizzas. THe one I took out was a little dry and cold, the flavor was still there. I don't like the small pepperoni. There should have been more cheese, but in the end it was a good pie. I will say, Ashley P did make a valid point in saying the cheese was plastic. This was not the creamy whole milk mozzarella that makes NYC pies so good. They either don't use a whole milk, or they use so little that it dries up and you lose the taste. On any real good, authentic NYC pie, the cheese is creamy, not dry. It was dry here, maybe its the lack of humidity in the desert. Don't bother with ordering a salad, the dressing is not home made, its standard restaurant bottle. I would never wait in line for this pizza, like I would at Bianco. They really need to sell slices."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! My hubby and I found this place just by chance and we love it here. We probably dine here about every other week. the pizza is delicious. They have thin crust and the toppings are fresh and made to order. On Tuesdays they have half off all wine bottles!   The service is excellent . I especially like the fact that I don't have to open that hot door handle , because they open the door for you!   Order the white pizza, its great!"}
{"text":"After doing tons of Yelp searching a group of friends and I decided to try out Grimaldi's for our monthly ladies dinner. I was really looking forward to it since the reviews were so good. First impression wasn't great, our server was probably one of the rudest servers I've ever had. She had a terrible attitude and seemed to overall hate her job. We were all really polite to her so I'm not really sure why she was so grouchy. On to the food, it was OKAY. Most definitely not anywhere near the best pizza I've ever had but maybe a slight improvement over dominos or Pizza Hut. It was essentially tasteless. There was little seasoning and almost no flavor. I think if I had a slice of cheese instead of the supreme I ordered it would have been even worse, the toppings definitely masked the blandness. Lastly it was super expensive. For any good topping add on its an additional $2-$7. Overall the service was bad and the pizza was mediocre."}
{"text":"I love eating at Grimaldi's but only give this location 3 stars as they did not offer a lunch menu. I was eating alone, but could only order a pizza and salad that both were clearly meant to be shared between two people. It was such a waste of food and money!"}
{"text":"Quite decent pizza ... we had classic tomato/mozz/sausage/mushroom & ricotta ... nice crisp crust and good flavor, even at a table with +1 checkered tablecloth at -1 fake outdoors in a -1 LV mall with horrible canned music.  We recovered with +1 some proscecco and beer.  Good, maybe VERY good, but not earth-shattering, but got us in the mood for Gondolas :)"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is a Brooklyn treasure. It is nice to be able to get Brooklyn pizza out west. If you are in Las Vegas, I highly recommend visiting Grimaldi's. We had the Grimaldi's salad. A large can be shared with 4 people. We ordered a large cheese pizza and a large The Don. Which is a meat lovers pizza with sausage, meatballs & pepperoni. Delicious. The waiter and bus staff were helpful, friendly and extremely efficient. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I finally got to experience the Grimaldi.  I made it an absolute stop when I was up in NYC last year, but the lines there were ridonkulous and I had to forgo that experience.  But when I found that there was one here, I had to come. And they simulate the exact same settings found in NYC. The pH of the water is balanced to the same standards in NYC. The brick oven is also set at 800 degrees and of course the ingredients are comparable found there.  But this time around, there was no line...granted it was 1am on a random Sunday night, and there were just a few people at the bar and the dining area, and I was hungry so I had to get me some of this fine pizza.  Screw the personal size 12\" pizza. I went for their \"small\" which is 16\". And within 30 minutes I had no problem eating the whole thing. The whole thing...and all by myself.  It was that good. I'm glad I got to experience it. And of course I would do this again. They have a wine list. You can choose to eat out in the patio, at the bar or in their pretty big dining area."}
{"text":"Very good pizza"}
{"text":"THIS is what passes for gourmet pizza in Glendale? I think not. You're kidding me. Grimaldi's is a sweet looking place in the desolate Park West. The decorations are great, and there is plenty of Sinatra playing to further the illusion of class, but once you sit down and look at the menu, the disappointment starts flying at you.  Appetizers? I think not, unless you're feeling like salad. There is salad, pizza, and wine. Also, a full bar, with beer. Not that having a simple menu is bad, it's just that when pizza is all you make, I expect mind blowing pizza. This falls flat on all levels.  The crust I'll admit was decent. Just the right amount of flavor and charring. You're getting that right. But the tomato sauce? Nothing special. Do they buy it from Safeway? The cheese? Just alright for a gourmet pizza, and certainly not enough of it. As far as toppings go, I don't like the idea of needing to order extra cheese just to have my pizza covered. Also, I feel every gourmet pizza joint of this magnitude should have proscuitto as an option. 'Ham' just isn't cutting it.  Don't fret, the white pizza was okay. It used just the right amount of garlic, and had a fair balance. It was a bit on the bland side, and I would definitely have olives on that if I ever came back.  But please, Grimaldi's, spare us all your pretentiousness. No matter how many decorations (your plastic hostesses included) you put up, or how much backstory you have about NYC, you define mediocre. Don't offer me some BS wine pairing with your pizza, the only pairing it deserves is a mug of Budweiser and a Yankee's game. It's just not quality stuff. Some poor chump is going to waste $40 on a pizza and some $5 BevMo wine thinking he's dining on something amazing. Meanwhile, I'll be enjoying my meal at a place like Piazza Al Forno. Take notes."}
{"text":"Seems to be dirty Every. Single. Time. The table cloths are always nasty, the mirrors behind the booths in the bar have disgusting smeared handprints, our silverware had dried food on it. Food is always top notch and service is hot or Miss but the manager never cares a bit about our feedback on cleanliness and I'm just done with this location. I'd rather drive to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I can see why some people give Grimaldi's five stars -- their execution is consistently perfect.  If you like the modern style of New York pizza, made with fresh mozzarella, you will enjoy your pie.  Period.  End of story.  Well, not quite.  Here are some issues:  1.  The salads are large but uninspired.  Fresh, but just the usual ingredients. 2.  The crust is thin and crispy -- if you like bready crusts, go somewhere else. 3.  Here, the pizza is about the cheese, but the red sauce could be a bit better and more abundant. 4.  It gets crowded easily -- you may have to wait.  This are really just minor things, but they add up.  Grimaldi's is a good pizzeria, but it is just a pizzeria after all.  By the way, they have another place in northern Scottsdale.  In my opinion, this location is better.  The pizzas up north have been soggy the two times I ate there.  Hint:  I think the milder toppings are better here because the crust and cheese are the stars.  Spicy pepperoni only detracts.  You might like tomato and basil.-"}
{"text":"Staff is not friendly at all.. all the way from hostess, bar and server.. heard great things before coming here but big disappointment.. not kids friendly as staff was cursing loudly..   Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here. My favorite is thin crust pepperoni, and Grimaldis is done to perfection.  The sauces are excellent. Caesar salad also good. Good place if you or family wants delicious pizza."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and gotten take out once.  The pizza which is NY style thin crust cooked in a coal fired oven is just the right thickness with some chewiness and good bite.  I would definitely recommend the white pie, which is much harder to find well done out here in AZ (outside of Bianco of course, or at least that is what I heard: I just am not willing to invest several hours of waiting just to get a pizza...).  White pie with sausage and fresh tomatoes definitely hits the spot at Grimaldi's: I've gotten more toppings in the past, but more than 2 or maybe 3 toppings overwhelms the crust.  The one thing I don't recommend here is the cannoli; the filling had a good consistency, but the shell was way too hard and their was an odd aftertaste present.  With how sensitive the crust is, this was not a very good bet for take out as with the thin crust, by the time you get it home it has already pretty much fully cooled."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday for lunch with the family, Sesame Street Live was on right out front. Only had to wait a few minutes for a table. Service was a little slow for how many tables are actually in the place. Food was amazing of course, we have been to 2 other locations, got a custom pizza. Friendly staff, very accommodating. Will always recommend!"}
{"text":"The server Anna was wonderful; sparkling personality!   Unfortunately,  it was overshadowed by the sloppy pizza and indifferent attitude of the pizza server.  We ordered a half and half.  One of my favorite toppings was not available (pineapple ).  Toppings ordered on one side wound up on the other half.  Every single slice.  If there was a food allergy, one of us would have been in trouble.   The crust was partially burnt on the edges.  We've had better pizza at a different restaurant,  and considering this was the specialty the pizza was overall  disappointing.   The manager was apologetic about the sloppiness and offered to make an individual pizza so ingredients wouldn't \"hop around\", but by then we were ready to leave.  Quite simply,  if you can't handle half and half on one without it being a sloppy mess then don't offer that option.  The indifferent attitude of the pizza server added to the annoyance.  Again, if the ingredients \"hop around\" it's because the pizza is being thrown together and not given adequate  care during the preparation!   The manager did discount the bill for the unwanted portion."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my brother for his b-day. We ordered a large pizza with pepperoni and meatballs on it and he ordered a peroni. Peroni is a light beer that tastes kinda of like a mix between a Stella and a Heineken. Now for the pizza. It was very tasty and I love how the crust was thin. It wasn't soggy at all but a little greasy because of the pepperoni. I love how they don't put the whole meatballs on the pizza but rather cut it into thin slices. This was my brothers first time eating here and he really enjoyed it. Also Our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza was boomb. Anchovies all day, my friends...  Keep it as plain as possible for full-flavor appreciation. The crust is thinner, so more toppings means more silverware usage. Booze flows like faucets and the people are really friendly.  Get some."}
{"text":"This is not really New York style pizza but it is from New York and I would call it more of the Connecticutt style pizza similar to Pepes.  I have never had Grimaldi's in New York, but I have had about ever other New York style pizza.  Nevertheless, coal fired ovens in Nevada?  Great pizza with great flavor.  The people here are really nice.  Their only weakness in my opinion is that they have Pepsi, but that is a matter of taste and Pelligrino works fine when I am there.   Great flavors, crust is crisp but thinner than a New York style.  This is the best pizza in Las Vegas, the staff is very attentive and the ingredients are superb.  A few noisy kids do come through but it is worth the frustration."}
{"text":"Meh. We were disappointed in Grimaldi's South Tempe location near Ahwatukee. The environment is fun and has great energy so a lot of potential. Their pizza crust, gluten free and regular is too hard. There are no pasta options. It is fairly expensive and we were unfortunately underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has the best Pizza in Vegas, no doubt.  I've been told by both family and friends that I needed to give this place a try, and I was not disappointed.  The thin crust hits the spot and surprisingly does something that seemingly no other pizza place in town attempts - the New York pizza.  The large pizza and a large salad is enough to feed 3 hungry men, so don't feel like you have to buy a ton of food. The environment is nice, but therein lies the rub with Grimaldi's.  With the nice environment comes the vibe of \"upscale\" eatery, along with the high price tag.  Which brings me to my 3-star review.  I don't care how good pizza is, it's pizza.  There's no reason that a person should spend $25 on a pizza (plus tip). So yes, I finally found a place in Vegas with good New York style pizza, but unfortunately, the pizza is too expensive to enjoy frequently enough to really care. Our final price came to about $40 with a large salad, large pizza, and two soft drinks, just to give you an idea.  It's a good pizza, and definitely worth a try, but the prices on the menu are outrageous."}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza restaurant in Scottsdale. Thin crispy crust, cooked in a coal fired oven. Small salad is enough for 4 people to share. We had the large \"Don\" pizza. (Meat lovers) and it was great. Good value and good service."}
{"text":"This week. Skimpy toppings and unbelievable pricing.  25-35 for a large pizza if you get a cpl toppings.  Very good tasting and flavor but add a salad and a drink and you are at 50 bucks for a pizza meal. No real entertainment value, boring. Maybe one TV at he bar  Unless you wanna blow 100 on a family night out for pizza...   PS Bashas has a similar oven and prepare a delicious  pizza for under 10.00!!. Tons of toppings pick it up piping hot save 90 for another day"}
{"text":"If you want pizza as good as just about any pie from the big apple, come here!   Pizza is crispy and sauces are tasty and well seasoned.  The white pizza is one of my favorites, real crispy and with a nice coal inspired char!  Be sure to get a Caeser salad as well, one of the best in the area."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza but found plastic in the Caesar salad and manager didn't care. Great service from waitress. Won't be going back. Not worth it"}
{"text":"So, the food was good.  They have a gluten free pizza crust, but don't order it if you are really intolerant.  It gets cross contaminated in the pizza oven.  Kind of pointless.  But everyone else in my party liked the pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has a prime location and a simple menu consisting of mostly pizza, salads, and drinks. I have been here several times and have been the recipient of take out as well, but sadly I have never understood all love this place gets. The pizza is mediocre and pricey, the salads are decent but nothing to write home about, and the drinks are just drinks. There are tons of other great places in Scottsdale to go for pizza and drinks. With that being said if you are in the area and craving pizza Grimaldi's will do just fine."}
{"text":"My family really loves Grimaldi's. The pizza is so delicious, very unlike the chain pizza restaurants in the area. The crust is so thin and crispy, the sauce has a very distinctly tomato flavor, not too seasoned or herb-y, and the cheese is so perfectly melty. It's not cheap, but it won't break the bank if you don't go crazy with toppings. The service has always been fabulous, just don't go at 4 pm! They clean out the ovens and you could wait up to an hour if you order after they start. Anyway, it's a great place in a great location. We will continue to go there when we crave REAL pizza."}
{"text":"I am starting to become disenfranchised with this location.  1.5 hour waits for a pie to go, last time it was soggy, when I asked for crisp...  I asked the kind woman why so long for take out last time and she said that they can't put a take away order in front of someone that is at the restaurant or waiting there...take away orders are the least important...\"would you want to wait longer because of a to go order\"?? That is a horrible thing to say to a customer....  I have always been a HUGE fan of Grimaldi's but the last 3 visits here are really making it hard...especially given that there are a lot of really good pizza joints in the east valley now...."}
{"text":"This place serves good food.  We ordered the pepperoni with extra sauce and the mediterranean salad. Delicious. Down side was it was cold by the time we got home. I know it would have been better had we ate it fresh out of the oven. Ah well. Live and learn. I know better for next time. Gotta say the salad was neck and neck with the pizza, which is rare. I'd definitely go back. I'm not going to say it was the best pizza ever but it was good."}
{"text":"If you were to ask me \"Ben, why would you eat pizza when you're in Las Vegas?\"   I'd say: \"Because my buddies were hungry and didn't wanna go to CPK!!!!\"   With that said, the service is slow. The pizzas are cooked in a coal-fired brick oven. If you are looking to do an individual portion, you will spend a lot of money. Come with a few friends and split a large pizza.  Salads are huge. I swear I saw them bring a fishbowl sized salad out. That was the small. Apparently, the fishtank sized one came after."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Service is also great. Our waitress, Tammy, was very kind and patient with our party."}
{"text":"Sadly this was not a completed experience which sucks cause A . I was super hungry and B. The menu looked pretty good and C. The signs all said they came recommended by TV.. So the hostess was really friendly, inside the mall they had an indoor and outdoor area .. We waited about five minutes and I had  been seated in an outdoor table for two .My Mom and I waited for Meagan .. Our waitress for over ten minutes with not so much as a \"sorry for delay I'll be with you shortly \" finally when the group of Italian people at the bar added yet another person to their group of standing people with backpacks we decided to walk out . It truly is a very bad experience when you get better service at Auntie Anne's ... After which I went back and spoke with the hostess to confirm my waitress assignment since I never did meet her and made a huge point to write this review because she truly let me down in many many ways but mostly in the area of not having my time valued . I've been eating lots of places lately and I'm back logged on reviews but this couldn't wait because it was kind of insulting not being helped however I've gotten to the point where I'm not going to give my business or money to a place who clearly could careless if I come or go ... The menu does look decent and while waiting the food looked good .. Hopefully I will give this place a go sometime but for now this was a huge wait of 15-20 minutes of my time on a Friday afternoon ."}
{"text":"I got my birthday pizza from there yesterday and it was spectacular! No need to go to places that say \"New York Pizza\" or inauthentic pizza chain restaurants. I had great service, loved every bite of my pizza and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good service and great pizza. The small salads are BIG and can definitely be split by 2 or 3 people. The Mediterranean Salad dressing was a bit to acidic. The Kale dressing was better. Pizza was delicious."}
{"text":"Great place. Good pizza. Nice thin and crispy crust. Toppings are fresh. Service is incredible, everyone seems to help out as a team. Kurt the Bartender is fun and knowledgeable.  The Blueberry Cobbler Cheesecake is delicious."}
{"text":"I never had any coal brick oven pizza until I went here. We had the peporoni and sausage, mainly meet, but it was good.  I wish though I like the crust more though it was a little dry.  But the cheese was great.  Everything was great :)"}
{"text":"This pizza is pretty delicious!  I'd gone here a few years back and thought it was good.  My wife and I decided to go hear with a couple friends the other day and had a good time.  The pizza was very good as was the house salad.  My wife is preganant and after eating here had a craving for more.  Yesterday she had me order out the same exact pizza and salad we had on Saturday night.  Just as good.  Two times in 3 days and the food was great both times."}
{"text":"We came in tonight to use a free birthday pizza coupon (which is an amazing deal- a large pizza for free?!). The weather was nice so we sat in a corner on the patio. The fountain right in front is great and kept my 3-year old interested while we waited. We got a half cheese, half pepperoni pizza. It really was quite delicious. I usually prefer thick crust (I'm a big fan of bread), but this thin crust was great and I would definitely come back for more. We also ordered the dessert trio with the cannoli, tiramisu and New York cheesecake. The cannoli was delicious. I've never had tiramisu before, so nothing to compare it to, but it was good. The cheesecake wasn't what I expected; it was a lot lighter and fluffier than what I've normally had. It also came with a raspberry sauce, I believe, which I didn't care for. But I didn't come here for the cheesecake. Overall, the experience was great, the pizza was delicious, and i would absolutely return."}
{"text":"This is a nice clean place to eat pizza and the service was very good but the pizza was just ok.I ordered as usual at all pizza places I go to rate here on YELP, A \"thin crust to the edge with pepperoni and fresh garlic\" Well The dough lacked flavor but was cooked pretty nice. The sauce was ok but just \"OK\". The cheese lacked flavor but was OK. And I ordered extra fresh garlic which they billed me twice for and was not fresh and there was not much there. I liked that they had a nice selection of beers on tap and some decent wine also. My mission was simple: to find the best NY thin crust pizza in Las Vegas and other places while I travel. I live in Vegas. So everytime I hear about a pizza joint that has good pie I write it down and try it out. I always order the pizza the same way and I never buy the pizza by the slice. This time this place set me back $45. I have still yet to find a better NY pizza than one made by Brian at NY PIZZA AND PASTA at Jones and Sahara. \" Thin crust all the way to the edge with Fresh garlic and pepperoni\"."}
{"text":"Feeling a bit under the weather from Friday night, Grimaldi's Pizzeria hit the spot. Our waitress was extremely nice and tried to make conversation with us, but we weren't exactly in the mood to socialize since we were hungry and hungover. The only downside to this place is the amount of time it takes for the pizza to bake. I wish there was a little something for us to munch on while we waited. Nonetheless, we ended up taking our pizza to-go. Ordering over the phone is a must since I really hate waiting. And it opens til 2am. Perfect to call & pick up after a night at the club."}
{"text":"Great table and bar service ! (Shout out to Sabrina and Mike). Our server was very accommodating and sweet. The manger also is very attentive.  Probably not the best place to go when you're trying to lay off the cheese BUT they will accommodate it! We asked for half-no cheese, traditional pizza and it was a no-brainer for them.   Pictured: 12\" TRADITIONAL PIZZA w/ ARTICHOKE, BLACK OLIVE, ITALIAN SAUSAGE, and MUSHROOMS ;  MEDITERRANEAN SALAD; LIMONCELLO MARGARITA.  Great for lunch. The salad was very refreshing. Try the margarita!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's red sauce calzone's and pizza are great!... but, I will never order white sauce pizza from you guys again; it's not the same anymore. I came about 3 months ago and I had a pizza with white sauce and it was great, but I don't know what happened this time.... :(  Not a great way to start my Vegas trip  -_-\""}
{"text":"You know, the sign of really good pizza is how long the leftovers last in your frig.  For me, a Grimaldi's sausage and pepperoni has never last more than twelve hours.  I know.  It stinks.  I keep promising myself as the server is boxing up the remains of our dinner, I'll have this for lunch tomorrow, it will be so good.  These leftovers never make it to lunch the next day.  Sometimes I wake up at two a.m..  There will be that familiar craving - ok, I'll just go grab one slice, and leave the rest for lunch.  Back to bed.  Up again at five a.m.  Time to get ready for work.  man, I'm hungry.  Scarf.  No more lunch pizza.  Make bologna sandwich for lunch.  Service has always been spot-on, I can honestly say I have never had bad service at this store, and I've been going for years.  My Peroni is always refilled, the food is always perfectly done, and the once or twice a mistake was made, the Manager caught it and brought us a free pie before we even knew there was a problem.  What?  MORE pizza?  Yeah, I\"m gonna refuse that.  Great pies, great service, nice ambiance, especially with the courtyard patio.  Prices are compatible with other \"high-end\" pizza places, but the value is greater."}
{"text":"Good pizza, with quality ingredients. It is perhaps better than average, but $2-3/topping(even onions) gets overpriced fast."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and salad. I've never had a pizza I haven't liked. The kale salad is to die for. The service has always been amazing too. Once your pizza is gone make sure you try their cheesecake. It melts in your mouth and is full of flavor.   Well tonight we were completely let down. We have always had amazing service but tonight not so much. Our waitress Bailey had our table plus two more. We had our pizza on our table before she was even sat the next two tables. While we were there she may have checked on us once with out us getting her attention. We went to her for out dessert and refills. The manager brought us over a box as well as our dessert when he asked how our meal was. We had to ask for our check and ask to pay our check!!!!!!!!  Seriously?  Our food however was amazing like always.  The butterscotch toffee cheesecake was delicious.   Never had service this poor here before. Bailey needs to learn how to be a server because handling 3 tables that were staggered should not warrant poor service."}
{"text":"Not as good as what I remember from my times eating it in Brooklyn, but it serves its purpose. Ultra thin crust. Probably what I like about this pizza it looks like a lot of food but it doesn't make you feel heavy after.  Wait staff is friendly. Pizza took longer than expected--I would think it would come out in less than 10 mins."}
{"text":"Hmmm...not sure what all the fuss is about.  Long waits for super oily bruschetta appetizer and pizza, overcompensating with mile high toppings instead of cooking it correctly and using flavors.  Cocktails were terrible!   I've never seen a martini come without olives and have the waitress be surprised we wanted olives....waitstaff seemed overwhelmed even though it wasn't that busy.   Nice to sit outside, people watch and have a glass of wine or beer. Would not partake in the overpriced, oily food or cocktails again."}
{"text":"Walked in at lunch time on a Saturday and was told the Pizza ovens were off but they'd be glad to get us something else. A pizzeria that doesn't serve pizza on a Saturday at lunch? No thank you."}
{"text":"In reading up on this place prior to going, I read that they actually hired a scientist that analyzed the water and they now make their pizzas with the same type of water as in Brooklyn.  And then we are talking to the young lady that seated us and she tells me that they change the coal in the oven twice a day.   How much more authentic and how much more can you care about your customers than that?  Absolutely outstanding place.  Loved their location (Palazzo Shoppes, LV Blvd. entrance), decor (light fixtures made from wine bottles), ambience, service and, most of all, their pizza. You walk in, are pleasantly welcomed and taken down a long hallway, passing smaller tables of patrons, to the main dining area. Ordered a small pizza with ricotta, sun-dried tomatoes and artichokes.  SOOO good!!  In fact, I love this place so much more than the Brooklyn location, though there is something to be said for standing on the sidewalk waiting to get in at the original.  And I thought the pizza was just better. Mabel was just a very pleasant, smiling and attentive waitress and was very patient with my wife's undecisiveness.  You can actually stand there and watch them make the pizza and shove it into the brick oven with their long pizza paddles, all burned and crusted.  Quite cool.  We also ordered a small dinner salad (that wasn't so small) with a dressing that was excellent.  We topped it all off with a superb Tiramisu.  Dang, that thing was good!  The only other pizza that I believe we like just as much or more is from Bottega Louie in downtown Los Angeles.  Either way, you can't go wrong.  If there was only one thing I didn't care for, was the price of the toppings. Four bucks each to add the artichokes and sun-dried tomatoes.  BTW, they didn't take reservations for only two, so they told us to just walk right up and check in.  We got there around 6:30pm, perfect timing.  I shall be back.  Vegas, baby!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza crust is really good but I'm just not a big fan of the red sauce.  All their toppings are really yummy.. but I just feel like the marinara is what makes a pizza.  I love love love garlic but the sauce is so garlicy that its bitter.  It's a great place for a big party, if your coming on a Friday night be prepared to wait 45 mins."}
{"text":"Holy smokes what a welcome! Thanks to Mariana for getting our visit started off right. She opened the door for us and began to ask us the usual questions \"how are you doing tonight?\" And \"have you dined with us before?\". When I said we haven't been there before, she quickly became interested and gave us some great recommendations as well as explaining that its a build your own pizza type place.  When Joanna (our waitress) took over, we were ready to order since Mariana familiarized us so well. We decided on a traditional antipasto that had the best mozzarella and delicious peppers. Then went for the small (which is huge) pesto pizza, that comes with the mozzarella. We then decided to add artichokes, mushrooms, pepperoni, and half traditional sauce since my friend doesn't like pesto. The pizza was made quickly in a cool coal oven and had an overload of garlic (just the way I like it). It truly was absolutely delicious and everyone was so pleasant. Thank you for treating us well!"}
{"text":"I came here while I was visiting my family.  And although I am a vegan, pizza is one of my favorite foods and I am very picky about it.  Here is the low down  Pizza: Very good, the personal size was sized just right, not teeny tiny and not a small size pizza in disguise.  The crust was thing and crispy and tasty, the sauce was fairly good and the topping selection was great.  I had no cheese with sun dried tomato, kalamata olives and artichokes.  The downside was each topping costs 2-4 $ extra, which is quite a lot I think.  However, they did give you a good amount of topping which is important since I don't have cheese.  I would order it again  Service:  The service was good, the waitress was chatty, which was slightly annoying, but she was nice and had good intentions.    Downside:  The iced tea was tasty but $$$, I think it was like 4 or 5$ for one drink my oh my that's crazy pricey.  Since there were four of us we spent over 20 dollars on non alcoholic beverages  Overall:  I would come back, I just would stick to water."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you get the feeling of walking into a NY pizzaria. The service, the pizza, & the build you own thin crust pizza was awesome!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza. Best in vegas yet!!!! I'm Italian from Brooklyn NY and it takes a lot to please me with pizza :)"}
{"text":"This place is really popular and loved for a reason. It's consistently good and relatively unique. The restaurant is clean inside and the staff is nice and friendly. It's a great sit-down semi-upscale pizza restaurant. There's really nothing standard or conventional about the food here except that the pizzas are round and they are made of cheese, sauce, and bread.   I'm not as much of a fan of this place as most people seem to be, but I can't deny that it's delicious. It just barely gets a 4/5."}
{"text":"All I must say is how I yearn for this pizza now. Now I've ate many of New York style pizzas. And I prefer NYC pizza over Chicago, Neapolitan, etc.   But Grimaldi's Pizza left such an impact on my taste buds. It was a combination of the fresh sauce, fresh ricotta, tomato and basil. The sauce especially... It wasn't heavy and pasty, it was fresh, tomato-ie and light. The coal fired pie was thin but cooked to perfection. But the sauce! It totally made the pizza. The only drawback was my wife and I ordered a small to share... And I wanted more   Please come to the San Gabriel Valley- Ca!"}
{"text":"Came to the Henderson location tonight for Sunday night dinner. Our waitress Amanda went above and beyond to help us. It was our first time eating at this restaurant. She went over a little history of the restaurant. Took our drink order. Offered advice on appetizers. Gave suggestions on pizza offered dessert. We couldn't help but say yes to everything. She continued to check up on us the entire visit. Great experience!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places in the Valley.  It can be a bit expensive but their pizza is consistently good.  I always order the sausage and pepperoni pizza.  Most places around here only have the sliced sausage, but Grimaldi's has crumbled sausage that I really like.  The pepperoni is miniature sized and is very good.  You can taste a little of the coal flavor on the crust and that makes it unique.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. Try sausage, bacon, garlic and mushroom. Mm.   Salads are good, but they should have a single serving option.   Good bar."}
{"text":"We typically love this location. Their food is always good; however, they have a manager, or GM as he likes to act like, that is very typical for our area. Young, insecure and THE boss in charge!  Conner has a knack for arrogance that can quickly put a damper on an evening."}
{"text":"We heard that this place was good, and decided to sign up for the twenty minute wait. Which ended up being over forty.  When we finally were seated, the waitress, came over and wanted to start a conversation about where we variously were from, and our reasons for visiting Vegas. We  just wanted to eat.  The waitress appeared offended that we weren't enchanted by her (Southern?) hospitality; and her response to our request for expedience, was to bray information regarding our food options, at high speed and volume   Braying at an almost painful level seemed to be her preferred manner of communication. I think that speaking at the same speed as the pe xqople who read the legal copy at the end of commercials was her special gift to us only.  The food was mediocre and not particularly memorable.  I found a foreign object (different ingredient) in my food, and when I pointed it out, the waitress told me that all the topping ingredients are in the kitchen, so sometimes they get mixed in accidentally.  Incorrect response. \"Oh, sorry\" would have been so much better.  I don't enjoy being patronised, and it becomes more annoying when the person taking the high ground has an inability to sense how to behave in varying situations.  This place doesn't get my customary second visit because I never want to encounter this awful woman again."}
{"text":"Good pizza and salad. Went there and had the Cesar and house salad. The house salad had a little too much vinegar for me but my wife enjoyed it. The Cesar was really good. We had the white pizza with sausage, meatballs, and pepperoni. It was really good. The crust wasn't too thick and not too thin. It was just right but a little greasy.  The ceiling was rustic and the light were made out of wine bottles. I thought that was pretty cool. Service was really good and everyone was very friendly. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and a great place to stop when in the area - where I live we have no Grimaldi's locations nearby.  As always the basic Margherita pizza was outstanding in its simplicity.  Nice and thin and not terribly filling - but you will have enough.  Finding the place can be a challenge because it is located on a faux-city-downtown shopping mall.  So you should follow your phone map app closely to locate Grimaldi's. Parking is available out front but is usually taken, so you most likely will have to park around the block in a larger lot.  Not too far of a walk, though."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, thin crust and quality ingredients, service was attentive and the space nicely cliché.  Downtown old Scottsdale pretty close to everything, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I always come here with my boyfriends family, I would've never tried this place if it wasn't for them! I'm not a big fan of pizza but after I ate here im in love, I love how thin the pizzas are here !!!!! And the cheese is so good!"}
{"text":"After my airbrush tan upstairs at Bronze Beauty of Las Vegas, I was hungry and picked up a large tomato and basil pizza. It was incredible. Best pizza in town by far!"}
{"text":"After my airbrush tan at Bronze Beauty of Las Vegas, I was hungry so I picked up a pizza and piece of cheesecake from Grimaldi's. I ordered a large tomato and basil pizza and it was cooked to perfection. This is the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"The pizza here is so good! The crust is my fav! It's hard to find really good thincrust pizza and that's what they have! The atmosphere is also nice, I don't mind coming in and picking up my take out order!"}
{"text":"The food is always great and have been coming for 12 years. The service at this location needs to improve. The past two times here I've had to wait an excessive amount of time to order, get drinks and food"}
{"text":"I didn't really think the pizza here was worth the price. It's a bit expensive for a sum number of slices. The service wasn't as great and the lighting is a bit too dark for my liking."}
{"text":"Super delicious!! First we walked in and sat right away which was excellent since we had just got off our flight and were ready to eat. Our server was Victor and he was great! Very prompt, brought us a menu right away, and we were able to decide what we wanted right away. We ordered a large pizza with mushroom, meatball and bacon. The starter large pizza was $18 and each topping was extra. There were tons of toppings anywhere between $2-$4. We were served our pizza within about 10 minutes which is fast for cooked to order. A large pizza was quite a bit for two people but we managed to eat all but two pieces which we took out for later. We also each got a soda and with tax it totalled up to $34.00 which is really great for two super stuffed people who won't need to eat again for hours."}
{"text":"My family loves pizza, o.k., I love pizza. Who doesn't love pizza? Grimaldi's delivers some of the best pizza in Phoenix!  Whenever we visit Grimaldi's Pizzeria, we order the ricotta and meatball pizza, slightly under cooked, we prefer it that way. Each and every time we get that pizza, we're always walking away happy and satisfied.  We also usually get the Cesar salad, ask for extra dressing, they usually don't add enough dressing.  If you're bringing your kids, don't ask for ranch, they don't serve it in their restaurant. What's up with kids, pizza and ranch?  Anyways, Grimaldi's is top notch. Awesome pizza.  Parking in this location is pretty tough so make sure to drop someone off to get a table while you park the car."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Grimaldi's!!  We have never had to wait to be seated. The salad is fresh and the pizza great. We came here to eat because of these attributes, but today the pizza crust was hard and it wasn't that warm. It tore up my husbands mouth. We mentioned his to our server Cody T and he said he would speak with his manager. I don't think I that happened because the manger her is very attentive and he did not come to our table at all. No discount on our check either. Hmm ?"}
{"text":"By far my favorite pizza place in town. Very very good!! And the Caesar salad is great as well! The only thing I've ever eaten that was not great was the calzone and each item added was 3.00 each on top of the regular price for a small which was 16.00. So I ended up paying about 26.00 for 1 calzone and it tasted terrible. Lesson learned! Only pizza and salad from now on which are both Great!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal pizza! Me and my kids got there pretty late, and even thought we were practically the only people in the restaurant, the waitress treated us with the upper most customer service and politeness. She eve went above and beyond to change the UFC fight that was on so my toddlers wouldn't have to watch it. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is consistently good!  Pizza and salads are amazing!  Great crust.  Italian food is really good.  Great menu for everyone.  Nice wine and beer list.  A little pricier for a pizza but worth it!  Clean space with good service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Planned a surprise going party for my husband here and they went above and beyond. Absolutely LOVE this location and their professionalism and willingness to go above and beyond. Tipped the waitress extra for helping so much with our large group and she thanked me for my generosity which surprised me. Truly top notch."}
{"text":"Super cute place. Walked in to small tables with red checkered table cloths and wine glasses. Lots of NY signs and decor everywhere.. Soooo Lady and The Tramp(but with no pasta). Enjoyed a ceasar salad and caprese salad. Both salads were fresh and tasty. Pizza was great with the thin crust. We watched the pizza makers from our table make the pizzas which was fun. I ordered a side of their marinara sauce for the crust and it was delicious. I was watching other tables and saw people getting bread, we were never offered any but apparently it is free.. Tried some sangria and it was good. Tried the canolli with some cappuccino to end the meal and it was amazing . The canolli had small choc chips with it and my husband and I were playing food hockey on who got to eat the last bite.   I wish this place had some other dishes like pasta... I was disappointed with the selection. Obviously it is a pizza place but I like to have some other options as well. I also didn't like how they charged such high prices for each topping. I like a lot of toppings so my large pizza was super expensive!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!  Loved everything about this restaurant....fantastic service, great food, good atmosphere.  We ordered the Mediterranean salad and pepperoni/ sausage pizza....shared between three adults and it seemed to be the perfect amount.  Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"First place my friends and I tried when we got here. Fantastic service and the food was hot and tasty. Love the salad, veggie pizza and the white pizza.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out Grimaldis for the first time a month ago and just had to come back! Andrea behind the bar made us feel like we were family. Her wine recommendations in addition to her knowledge about the menu made our experience very enjoyable. When we went back in tonight to sit at the bar we got the same attentive service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Not much to say other than the fact that this is probably the best pizza in town.  Thin NY style crust is the way to go and great toppings to choose from.  Never lets me down order-wise and service is always highly friendly and attentive. You never catch a waiter on a bad day.  Try the seasonal cheesecakes. They're out of this world awesome."}
{"text":"We really had a tough time deciding whether to give this two or three stars. We thought two was too cruel, but the food just wasn't above average enough to merit three stars. Unfortunately, two-and-a-half stars wasn't an option on Yelp.   We recently moved to Vegas/Henderson. After all the buzz we'd heard and great reviews we'd read, we finally decided to give Grimaldi's (9595 S Eastern) a try for our first Vegas-area pizza experience. We were very disappointed.   This was probably the first pizza we'd ever ordered where we didn't take the leftovers home. We ate half a large between us, and had them toss the rest.   We noticed all the waitstaff were overselling the pizza and telling everyone who came in that it was the best pizza in town. In our humble opinion, the pizza should speak for itself. Sorry, but if this is the \"best pizza in town,\" then this town must have the worst pizza in the world.   The worst part was the crust. It was like a bland water cracker with black burned marks on the edges. It was dry, crispy, and flavorless. The pizza was kind of like a Carr's Table Wafer with a few toppings on it. In fact the pizza was so dry that The Mrs. ordered an extra side of marinara in an attempt to make it more palatable. Unfortunately this pizza was beyond hope. Even with the extra mozzarella The Mrs. had ordered, there still was barely enough cheese.   It was so thin that the waiter didn't even need a potholder to carry the pizza out. Two minutes after it hit the table it was cold. Perhaps if there had been some pizza and toppings it would have stayed warm longer.   We also noticed pictures of New York City all over the walls. Calling it a \"New York\" style or \"East Coast\" style pizza doesn't make it good. Maybe it was modeled after a really bad New York pizza. I'm from the East Coast (Boston), and have been to New York many times. There are a lot of different kinds of pizza available on the East Coast. My favorites were ooey, gooey, and had a flavorful chewy crust. Whether the crust is thick or thin, it's the texture that makes the difference. This Grimaldi's pizza crust had no texture or chewiness. It tasted as plain as a burnt cracker. The skimpy cheese and sauce didn't help either.   Others may differ, but personally I do not like black burnt portions on my pizza. Even the best pizza can get burned spots. I don't know if this happens from the oven being too hot or from an improper mixture in the crust. I've experienced this on many different pizzas and I'm just not a fan of it. Some people don't seem to mind it, and even the best pizza can occasionally suffer a burned spot and still be good, so I've come to accept it. It's still a negative for me, although not a deal-breaker. If that was the only issue with the Grimaldi's pizza, I wouldn't give it such a low rating. In this case, the black spots on the crust edges were just insult added to injury.   Perhaps this would be good for someone who likes dry pizza. This was about the driest pizza we've ever eaten. Sorry, but we just don't like dry pizza.   On the plus side, the waitstaff was very nice. Also, our small side salad was huge and delicious. They also had a pretty nice wine selection."}
{"text":"I've been here quiet a few times. I like the pizza a lot. This review is more about the service.   We went last Friday night and it was busy but not insanity. We walked up the hostess and she didn't say anything just waited for us to tell her our information. I let it go and told her party of two and our name. She says \"ok\". Since it was busy I have to ask her how long the wait is. Annoying. Isn't this your job? Give a good first impression, speak, give the customer a heads up on wait etc.   We get to our table 20 minutes later and take our seats. This was a special night out for my hubby and I and I had brought a gift and card. We ordered appetizers- the antipasto- which by the way is TERRIBLE! I could open up Safeway french bread, deli meat and tasteless mozzarella at home. Spare me the $9.  After we order I give my husband his card and gift and a waitress, who wasn't even ours by the way, comes over WHILE he's opening it and asks \"what'd you get?\" And hovers. So rude and none of her business. I was pretty annoyed and in hind sight I wish I would have spoke to the manager.   I'll go back because I love the pizza but maybe next time I'll do take out."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the manager... He greeted my girlfriend with \"what can I do for you\".?  Clearly when you enter a restaurant you are not there to get your tires rotated... Also there was a long wait and there is absolutely no seating for the people that are waiting.. We wanted to walk around the shopping area while we waited but they have no pager system or text alert to let us know that our table was ready.   Food was good,  staff other then the manager was nice. A little pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  Not really worth the $26. Ordered a large Mediterranean salad as an appetizer, which was good.  It just came out 5 minutes before the pizza.  Soda was flat.  Service sucked.  Left a tip for the sake of the bussers. 90% sure I will not be back."}
{"text":"Me and a friend ate here yesterday with a coupon I had for a free 18 inch birthday pizza. The pizza was amazing. The service was quick and I was impressed that the manager came and spoke with every table making sure everything was okay. The drinks were strong and reasonably priced. Excellent service for sure."}
{"text":"The food and service were both fine. Problem?  Cockroaches!  We sat outside on the patio and there were many dead roaches laying around and live ones crawling up the leg of my friend. This is unacceptable, and Grimaldis needs to have a standing treatment program. Don't wait for the roaches to appear. Also, sweep the floor before opening so customers don't need to see all the dead ones while enjoying their meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an excellent veggie pizza a few nights ago at the fashion mall Vegas location.  It was just right with all the veggies and not too salty. Service was spotty.  Would recommend this pizza chain for excellent pies and price was reasonable. Try it!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends and the pizza was pretty good. The ricotta cheese and tomato toppings were fresh and clean and very tasty. However, what I remember is a peachy-vanilla-martini which definitely got me a little tipsy, even before I finished it! But I'm also a lightweight.   The atmosphere was pretty casual and very well-lit. I loved their ceiling-high windows. Their service was attentive and pretty quick. 4 stars."}
{"text":"My wedding reception was flawless!!  The Grimaldi's staff were amazing!  They made our night happen!!  Food was wonderful! Corrine and Emmie thank you foe makomg this happen!! Intimate and elegant the way we wanted our night to be!!"}
{"text":"I'm not one who eats pizza often but when I do, I want to ensure that it's going to be fabulous!  I just moved to Scottsdale from San Diego and I was craving some pizza today.  It's also a lazy day with it being a holiday weekend, so I wanted something delivered as well.  I love white pizza and I love pesto pizza, so I turned to Yelp to see what I could find.  I was happy when I stumbled across Grimaldi's site and found both options that I liked.  From looking at the images, the bread looked thin and tasty and both pizzas looked good.  I then turned to Doordash in, hopes that they even that out here and was happy to see that they did and that they picked up from here!    If I had to pick between the 2 pizzas, it would definitely be pesto.  When I placed my order I took a shot at asking for half of each type that I liked...why not, it was worth a shot!  The one thing I don't like is burned bread, I know some people love that about pizza but I don't.  I checked to have it lightly cooked and then made a note to not have it burned.  45 mins later, a fabulous thin crust pizza that was half pesto and half Quattro formagio arrived at my door!  It tasted absolutely fabulous :).  I can't speak for the actual location as I had it delivered, but the food gets my vote!  Prices are also reasonable, I paid $11 for a 12\" which didn't have any meat.  For me I could easily share that with another girl, which makes the price even better.  I've also just moved to AZ from CA, so everything here is cheaper!  In addition, they have several other different pizza flavors, starters, salads, desserts and a very extensive beverage list!"}
{"text":"People that know me know that I am really not a huge fan of pizza so, I went to Grimaldi's not expecting much because it is always the same. Wow I was wrong here. Great thin crispy but not too crunchy crunch with great wood fired taste. Very good."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is thin crust, coal fired brick oven pizza. It's very evenly cooked, with no cold, thick, soft, or soggy spots. There can be a long wait from time to time; we were seated after 30 minutes and warned that pizzas were a further 45 minutes behind. So we take the time to order appetizers. We have tried two of theirs, the antipasto and the caprese. Both have been very good with EXCELLENT fresh mozzarella.   I'm almost a fan (4-star) except the price is too steep in my opinion. I really dislike the pricing structure for toppings at Grimaldis. $2 for any size, half or whole, and you can't even pay $2 and get two 1/2 toppings like most pizza places. As a result, my wife and I have to pay $4 on top of an already slightly overpriced pizza, which results in a very overpriced pizza.  Oh and what's up with only one bathroom each for men and women? A restaurant seating 200 people really needs more toilets. And the way they're tucked into a corner of the restaurant, it's even awkward trying to wait your turn."}
{"text":"We enjoy this pizza tremendously... Great pizza and salads.  The service was great. We keep returning...very friendly"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas!!! We love Grimaldi's. We usually order pepperoni pizza and a Mediterranean salad. It is thin crunchy crust. The closet to NY pizza outside of NY. They also give the kids some dough to play with while waiting for the food.  Only complaint is 2 times we ended up leaving bc they were cleaning the oven and it would be 30 mins before they can put the pizza in the oven. Both times was right after we picked up the kids from school. So I guess they do it around 3:30."}
{"text":"Came this time for lunch, a make up session for a bad experience last time we were there for dinner. The manager sent me a giftcard for 25$ so it was a good faith gesture.  Today we had large pepperoni with bacon pizza, lg antipasto appetizer. Server was on point today and everything was good.  Will definitely return.  Thanks to Lisa the manager for being respectful and so nice"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, you can get creative and have half the pizza one way and the other totally different and that includes the sauces.  Great place for large groups, plenty of seating.  Also if you love desert you have to try the new york cheesecake and my favorite the tiramisu.  Its hard to find a place that makes a truly good tiramisu but Grimaldi's has mastered it!  Don't leave without trying it.  They are a little high priced on the pizza's but definitely worth going."}
{"text":"I am not the biggest fan of pizza but decided to try it . The pizza was okay but I would prefer BJs"}
{"text":"As suspected, my next visit was absolutely fantastic. Great pizza, cooked perfectly after the stoking. Had the Long Island Limonchello Martini and it was incredibly tasty. Redemption!"}
{"text":"This location is the reason I now frequent Grimaldi's Pizzeria when I'm around one.  A customer was dining on a take-out pizza in the food court.  It looked so much better than anything available in the food court.  I asked where it was from, tried Grimaldi's for myself, and have been going back ever since.  Be sure to join their e-club for special offers."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's pizza is awesome.  No doubt the best \"chain\" pizza I've had.  The balance of cheese, toppings, and crust is perfect.  No issues whatsoever.    The Caesar salad was also very good, and larger than I thought it would be.  Pricing is good for the quality of the food served but not dirt-cheap.  The service was top-notch as well (but admittedly was a weekday at opening and not busy).  Overall, a great experience and highly recommended to other pizza lovers."}
{"text":"I love this place but tonight the service was horrible and the wait time was ridiculous. Finally seated when 1/2 the place was empty. Took 20 minutes just to get bread for table."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good! Price is very reasonable. We were dressed up for a Halloween party and no one would serve us at the Wynn where we were staying! We were starving! We were so happy to be seated! Excellent service! The staff is phenomenal! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Yum! My favorite pizza place in Vegas! My fiancé and I usually get salad to start and share a pizza. We like ricotta meatballs and jalapeños on our pizza! It's so good! Good beer selection and service is friendly and attentive. Very relaxed environment."}
{"text":"First let me say the hostess was very accommodating and our waitress was equally accommodating and nice. We had 2 16\" pizzas and 3 drinks from the bar. But, honestly this was the worst pizza I've had in a long time. The pie itself was burnt on the bottom and very chewy. The toppings were sparse also. For a $100.00 bill l definitely expected better. I would recommend Domino's thin crust over this eatery. So very disappointed. Don't waste your time and money here."}
{"text":"The pizza crust was perfectly thin. Ricotta cheese, olives, meatballs n a Caesar salad so good!!! Worth the calories!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good service and always have the best pizza .. Every time I crave pizza I love coming here..  The staff are friendly and I never had a bad experience here yet.. If you enjoy spinatos you'll enjoy the food here as well"}
{"text":"It's always hard to write a long review about a food place. Grimaldi's is the best, every time I've stayed at the palazzo my family and I eat here at least once, the food is always fresh, this time I had a salad and the Don pizza everything was fresh and flavorful. Everyone left happy and full, the staff is friendly, prompt, kept the drinks full and was on top of things. Thank you! Keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"For what you're paying, there are much better options. Find some family owned Italian restaurant instead of paying a premium for the corporate branded Grimaldis. It's not that the food is _bad_. It just... isn't particularly good.  My one big gripe: the raw garlic. The past three times I've been there I've found bits of garlic in my food that aren't cooked and have a very harsh, bitter flavor. That really ruined the experience there for me and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love love the brooklyn bridge pizza! I like to customize mine with extra mozzarella and ricotta and add meatballs!"}
{"text":"Fashion Show Mall location. The food was good and priced well. You pay per topping on the pizza and the toppings are different prices. Pesto pizza with artichokes,  red peppers, olives,  and sliced meatballs. Would be a 4 Star but the service wasn't good. We did a lot of waiting around for our server."}
{"text":"Ricotta, extra mozzarella, pepperoni and Italian sausage make the best pie. Kim is a great personality."}
{"text":"I've heard and read the hype over the place and finally got a chance to give it a try.  I consider myself an experienced pizza eater and attended with my resident pizza expert.  We were both in agreement that this pizza was did not live up to the hype. All the toppings were bland.  I don't know how you can rob bacon of its flavor but they managed to achieve this task here.  A large pepperoni, mushroom, bacon and half Italian sausage pizza was ordered and was just largely disappointing.  The artisan crust on a New York style pizza just doesn't work for me.    Now any red blooded American knows that ranch is mandatory with pizza.  Not hidden valley bottled ranch but a creamy delicious fresh made ranch more than complements a slice... It completes it.  So as we dined on America's birthday we requested ranch and were denied!  They do not have ranch because the executive chef does not approve of low brow ranch.  After this statement was made the server proceeded to bring out a shaker of, fresh out of the powdered bottle, of Parmesan cheese.  Ranch isn't acceptable but this is?    I will not be returning.  If you're looking for pizza In Vegas go to Secret Pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is absolutely one of my favorite pizza places in the country. I first had Grimaldi's at their location in Brooklyn at the advice of a friend. I waited in the hour and a half line outside the Brooklyn location because I heard it was so good and I'm glad I did. Everything about this pizza is amazing. Their sauce is what makes the pizza. Their crust is also very good. The Vegas location was a just as good as the Brooklyn location and you didn't have to wait the hour and a half. Definitely check out Grimaldi's if you want a good pie."}
{"text":"There aren't enough stars available to rate Grimaldi's!! My husband went there while on business in Vegas and took me back this past weekend. I was blown away with the service, the pizza and the environment. We got there around 430 on a Saturday and it was perfect timing because about 15 minutes later it was packed. We had extra mozz, pepperoni and sausage on our pizza. We got the small and finished it. It's not heavy so it was perfect. Use the garlic powder!! Two thumbs up! Love it! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Very limited options on menu, pizza was really expensive for the quality. Wasn't greeted had to sit myself at the bar of which a manager commented harshly for doing so to a staff member. Menu was not explained to me or the process of making the pizza as other person\"s that walked in were. Won't be back to this place or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza but this hit the spot. You add your own toppings and the \"small\" is more than enough for two or three people."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizzas ever. As anyone from a pizza city knows, they gotta get the whole thing right. Grimaldi's crust is perfect, the tomato sauce has just the right flavor, and the toppings are top notch. You can smell this place the moment you enter the Palazzo building or turn the corner from the shops, and I'm very happy to say it's as good as it smells, maybe even better. Never have to wait to be seated, with fast and friendly service. We always have to hit Grimaldi's when in Vegas, and it's ruined us for any other pizza. Go, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Service: We had a great server. Wish I knew her name. We came from California and met a friend here. I ordered a large garden pizza with artichoke hearts and a personal peperoni pizza for 4 adults and 2 kids.   I asked our server for a glass of water and an iced tea for my friend who was on his way to join us. They offer 2 different iced teas here. Since I hadn't seen my friend for more the 10 years, I had no idea which one he would want. As soon as my friend arrived, she delivered a nice tall ice water and asked my buddy which ice tea he wanted.   I had my wife, my father, and my 2 kids plus my long lost buddy with us.  Our server was so cool she didn't \"offer\" to top off my son's soda until my wife asked for one.  It wasn't because of lack of service, she (or the business) doesn't give the kid the choice, or suggestion, of a refill; the parent has to instigate the request. What a great idea! Thank you for that.  We loved the location and ambiance. We happened to be there during a downtown President's Day celebration. Wish we had more time to spend there.  My wife loved the wine bottle lamps even though she is a beer drinker, not wine. We also like watching the cooks throw pizza dough in the air.  Food: really liked the thin crust. I liked the garden pizza and my dad liked the peperoni. My kids favor Little Cezars (ah so much to learn, so much to experience). That being said, the boys asked our server for some raw dough and, low and behold, almost instantly, 2 thick pieces of dough were delivered on a pizza pan in the shape of pizza slices.  Loved the place. Would have liked to have had more time there. Not their fault but ours. Well done guys.  Price:  Price matched the service, food and location.  I would love to return and try some of their calzones."}
{"text":"Good crust and toppings. Love a brick fired pie!!! They don't deliver but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with my BF and his friend.   We shared:  Antipasto plate ($12)- salami, olives, fresh mozzarella, roasted garlic red peppers, bread.  Pretty good, but antipasto is pretty standard.   Pizza with mushrooms and meatball (lrg- $14, + 4 for toppings) - the meatball was more thin sliced onto the za than mini rounds I was expecting. It was pretty good thin crust for a chain. It was crispy with good char on the bottom, but a bit chewy and the sauce was good. Apparently they recreate the conditions of the Brooklyn water to get the crust right. The only drawback is the large size- it means I need to plan for friends to come along if I want some Grimaldi's.  Our server was friendly, personable and attentive. Our server asked if we want a bit of greens to go with it (doesn't come with it and no charge for some if you want it) and brought that out with some vinaigrette and that did help the antipasto be better. Our drinks were kept up on and we were checked on throughout.   It was my first time at a Grimaldi's and I think I like this. There's one closer to our house so I think I'm gonna head to that one."}
{"text":"Our very first night and not only did Anthony make us a fan with his super customer service and kid glove kindness in walking us thru the Grimaldi way, the pizza, wine and desert were superior to anything we've expierenced before.  After a wonderful meal and expierence, Gino, the manager came over to our table to thank and talk to us and encouraged us to come back again which we certainly will.  All the rave reviews we've heard over the past several years before trying you, did not do you justice.  Thank you for making us raving fans."}
{"text":"The BF and I came after a beer festival and needed something comforting to sop up the boozing.   We ordered a small caesar salad to start. I normally don't go for a caesar salad except when there is a possibility to have it with anchovies. Squeeze a little lemon on the anchovies, some crunchy romaine with creamy dressing is my idea of a comfort salad. I'm \"weird\", but you do know that is what a legit caesar dressing is made of.   We got a thin crust mushroom pizza and the crust was pretty crispy and light throughout.   Service at this location was friendly, funny, and attentive on drinks and checking if we need anything.   For a chain pizza, I think Grimaldi's is pretty good and has been solid every location I've been to."}
{"text":"Can I say YUM???  This was the cheapest and the best meal I had in Las Vegas.     Grimaldi's features pizza and salads.   I got a large pepperoni pizza.  It was enough for my husband and I to eat the entire thing (we were starving though).   If you weren't that hungry you'd have a couple of slices for leftovers the next day.   The crust is to die for.   Crispy, thin, and oven baked.    The cheese and sauce is on key.     Caesar salad was good but I wish I would have tried the Mediterranean.  The dressing was missing a key ingredient (anchovies).       Never ending refills on the soda.   We had a very nice waitress and busboy who checked in on us often but not so much that it was annoying.   It was nice to encounter employees who are happy at their jobs.     We also sat outside and it was very clean and inviting.     Total bill was less than 35 dollars for two people.     We are customers for life!"}
{"text":"This place was good but not the best in my opinion.  Very nice decor and friendly staff.  And the pizza was good with fresh ingredients.   But it was super pricey for pizza and for a sit down restaurant the menu was SUPER limited. They have pizza and 6 salad options... that's it! No appetizers and no other entrees.  For the prices they charge there are other pizza places I would rather go instead"}
{"text":"There are a lot of pizza places, but I really enjoy Grimaldi's.  Thin crust pizza is my favorite and this place has it.  About once a month I'll suddenly get a craving for this pizza!  I think I'd have to say this is my favorite pizza joint in Las Vegas.   Their house salad is tasty - a small is good enough for two people.  You get to choose your toppings and type of pizza.  I like to go for the normal red sauced pizza with sausage and mushrooms. I normally don't even like sausage on my pizza's but for some reason, it's really good here!  A medium pizza is probably good for two people, but we always get a large and finish it all.  Can't get enough!  Their sauce is boss and I love that they give you garlic powder on the side.  The pizza is normally never soggy (I've only had that happen to me once).  It still didn't deter me away from this place.   I have to admit that the pizza here is slightly expensive - I wish each additional topping wasn't so much.  Be sure to sign up for the mailing list and you'll get a free pizza pie on your birthday and also some 5 dollar off coupons once in awhile."}
{"text":"YUM Pizza!! Real Pizza lovers would adore Grimaldi's! i've been to the one in New York and I have to say about this one comes pretty close.  It just tastes a wee bit different! Just be careful because toppings range in price $2-4 and are extra!! So don't try and break your bank with all those toppings, unless you have lots of $$$ (unlike me)   The large size is big with huge slices; it's a nice treat to share and split the bill between friends ;)   Also, their cheesecakes are the best in town! Butterscotch and Oreo are the bomb!!   Lastly, it wasn't very crowded at night and the service is top notch So if you're looking for a real pie, then Grimaldi's is your spot."}
{"text":"Great Thin crust pizza. Easy Pick-up!! Seasonal specials are really good also. Must get desserts!!"}
{"text":"We probably frequent this place once a week. It's seriously THE BEST pizza in Las Vegas hands down. My man is from NY, and is VERY picky. Something about the hard water here makes the pizza crust tough, and in NY they have soft water? ANYWAYS, he loves it, so I guess that means they are doing something right.  Service is great! The manager has stopped by a few times to ask us how everything is. The menu is simple, we always get a Large Sausage/Mushroom. The pizza sauce is tangy, and flavorful! They use fresh mozzarella instead of processed. You can tell their ingredients are high quality. We have also tried their Small House Salad - totally big enough for 2 people to share - it's fresh, and crisp, and exactly what a salad should be. Also try their Antipasto plate, it's amazing as well.  Can't say enough good things - maybe that's why it's our weekly pizza stop :)"}
{"text":"I like pizza...and Grimaldi's was delicious. I have gone on two different occasions and both times the food was consistently good. The salads are good- not too much dressing, but coated well. The pizza was great both times. The first time I went I had a cheese with tomatoes and mushrooms and red sauce; it hit the spot. The second time we had white with ricotta and tomatoes, and I must say I was disappointed I didn't get to eat the leftovers. To finish the second meal we split a slice of reeses peanut butter cheesecake and sipped some frangelico. It was a delicious combination."}
{"text":"We're from Chicago so let's just say my husband's expectation for his pie is always up there. So it took us quite a while to find a place here in Vegas that satisfies our craving for a great pizza pie. This place delivers! We've been here a few times and each time ordered a meat lovers pizza and their signature salad.  Salad- just a salad, nothing special. Pizza- Delivered!!! Thin to perfection. Has a nice crisp and the brick oven taste you just can't beat. Love the fresh tomatoes and mozzarella chunks. Only thing I wish is that they expand their menu to more than Pizza, salad greens and Calzones. But even with a limited menu, we'll keep coming back for those Pizzas."}
{"text":"Food is good,  but the menu is limited. Their cleaning practices are poor, they brush crumbs off the table on to the floor and chairs, the bothersome part is they don't brush the crumbs off the chairs.  Our waitress was nice but didn't do a very good job. After ordering 1 pizza she immediately put her note pad away,  my friend had to tell her we weren't done ordering. My 2 other companions also wanted salads. She also grabbed a glass before asking if we wanted more and when we didn't, put the glass back down.  I've never had a server do these things.   Very disappointed, especially since they are so pricey. Over $50 for 1 pizza and 2 small salads."}
{"text":"THE BEST PIZZA EVER- I love the thin and very fresh sauce and toppings- Great Service and atmosphere- Have you ever OD'd on a place you liked too much???"}
{"text":"I've been here several times but only on my recent visit have I discovered I like Grimaldis less that I thought I did. I enjoy the thin crisp crust but I hate the fact they charge for every topping. Pizza starts at $14 for small and ranges up to $18 for large. Then add your toppings. Only cheese comes.m every additional topping is an added fee. Most of the time I'm here with a few gal pals so the bill is so cheap for the three of us because we divide the bill three or four ways. The last visit the pizza was so dry. Needed more sauce and cheese. Had we added more it would have been a $30 pie. Which is too pricey in my opinion for some almost burnt pizza. All the other visits have been pretty decent so I will give the benefit of the doubt. The salads here are always fresh and tasty. My favorites are the Mediterranean and the Caesar. With plenty of pizza options in Vegas if we continue to get dry burnt pizza, Grimaldis will no longer be an option."}
{"text":"This chain makes cRaZy good pizza pie yo!  This particular location is great, clean, well managed, with wonderful servers who are very helpful and accommodating but they don't 'hover'.  We were lucky enough to get seated in the little private area out of the noise and nobody else was seated in the rooms with us.  Very nice!  The main dining room does get loud so if you like it quiet, ask for this room.  The Pizza?  Oh yeah, the pizza.  Freakin' GOOD.  Especially if you like that thin crust.  We all ordered our own (yes, way too much food) but it was nice to customize exactly what I wanted and not have to share my precious bounty.  I don't ever do deserts.  But our waiter talked us into ordering an Oreo Cheesecake.  I wasn't going to even have a bite but I did out of curiosity and Whoa Doctor!!!  ... that bad boy is GOOD!  cRaZy GOOD!  Don't hesitate to give this chain restaurant a chance.  We were pleasently surprised!!!"}
{"text":"This is great pizza. I love the mozzarella they use-it's the best,all others are only pretenders. It's obvious they use good ingredients. I wish it were more comfortable to eat in,like with booths,but overall it's a great place with great food. I didn't really like the calzone with ricotta as well as the pizzas-I'm just not a fan of the ricotta vs other cheese.The only thing I wish they would do is offer coupons so I would go more often. I asked them if they would take a coupon for the other grimaldi's and they snootily said they don't take coupons.  la di da-still good eats. A pizza is a bit pricier than some,but worth it."}
{"text":"The general manager reached out in a professional caring manner. Thank you for taking time out. The fix was better communication to provide the same great service that matches their great quality of food."}
{"text":"Tremendous thin crush pizza. Not to crunchy, not to doughy, just right. The atmosphere is causal, clean, and with lots of vigorous activity. Very good pizza!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't get it! Way over priced for just so-so burnt pizza while sitting on uncomfortable chairs, and people packed in like sardines, couldn't even hear yourself think.  The smell of the oven was nice though."}
{"text":"Our server Anthony earned this place it's four stars.  We had 2 birthday parties with a party of 12.  Not only did he check on us frequently but he also waited on 7 other tables.  He was more attentive than other servers at fine dining establishments.  If you're looking for a place that accommodates small to medium size parties, go to Grimaldi's on Eastern.  Make sure you ask for Anthony."}
{"text":"Going to make this short and sweet like my review of Grimaldi's at Palazzo.... get a meatball, pepperoni and ricotta pie. You won't be disappointed. Ceasar salad is simple and just right.  Definitely one of the better options at the Fashion Show Mall. Service was good and food was on point with other locations."}
{"text":"Get a pie (pizza) with meatball, pepperoni and ricotta. It's awesome. The antipasto was great as well. Friendly staff and nice location inside the Palazzo.  No major complaints here."}
{"text":"I have been to this Grimaldi's before and always enjoy. The pizza is great, the wine is dry and he staff usually friendly and helpful. I have ordered take out and sat in. I also have my go too of pepperoni pizza and a glass of red wine.  They have some outdoor seating which is probably a plus for the cooler evenings!"}
{"text":"Everyone has different tastes in pizza. Being second visit. First visit had the margarita pizza and enjoyed it a lot. This visit had the Brooklyn bridge. Not so much. Sausage was sparse and very small. Ricotta cheese was way over the top. Brought over half home. Maybe the wife will consume. Would return but order different choice."}
{"text":"Been a regular patron for many years. Originally from Dallas, we have a couple in the metro-area. So I was elated when I found out they have some in the Valley. Always a good experience and the pizza is great. I usually get a white pizza, ricotta cheese, Italian sausage, and basil after the pizza has been cooked. The cannoli...delicious. Been here a couple times during happy hour and I must admit: I go in with the intention of just drinking a glass of wine and dipping out. 100% of the time I end up drinking more and inhale a pizza. No shame."}
{"text":"The pizza and service was really good. We got a small red sauce with pepperoni and mushrooms."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite spot.. pizza was on point, good service and super friendly! The last two times we went to dine in we have had major #pizzafail. So our recent visit we go order our food get an appetizer, salad and two pizzas. Our appetizer comes out no problem but then we see our pizza coming out YAY it gets set down and we notice the main ingredient on our order missing: pepperoni! The server comes over acts like it's totally our fault then says we will make a new one. Awesome!! BUT salad never comes out either... we wait a little longer and still no sight of salad so we finally ask and she's like oh I forget because I put it in fridge. Ok cool so bring it out no biggie. Finally get the correct pizza but took so long we had to box it up and go because kids were getting tired. Server hands us bill and does not take care of anything not the pizza that they got wrong... they didn't take off the salad that never came until we asked.. no apology for what happened. We never got one refill on our drinks either. Now looking back our server had a big area to cover and it felt like they were understaffed. So I do give sympathy for that situation BUT we just feel like the amazing quality and happy vibes we got from this place is gone. Sadly we may have to find a new weekly pizza joint."}
{"text":"Keeping this Review Short, Sweet and to the Point:  This is the Best NY style Pizza I have ever had...in Las Vegas."}

{"text":"We had a taste for some good New York style pizza and heard a Grimaldi's opened recently out east of us at the furthest reaches of the realm...San Tan Village in Gilbert.  I knew from Yelp reviews of other Grimaldi's that we needed to check them out for ourselves as they are reputed to be the real deal.  We started with a small mediterranean salad ($7) and a Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat.  I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the small salad.  It was more than enough for the 3 of us to share.  It had fresh, crisp greens and a good amount of yummy feta, olives, red onion slices and ripe tomatoes.  The sunset wheat ale was tasty but wouldn't be my first choice.  For my taste it was too fruity with a hint of clover or something.  And then the pizza arrived.  Magnifico!  A thin yet supportive and crunchy crust with a nice tomato sauce and delicious slices of mozzarella!  We each devoured 2 slices, saving room for dessert.  For dessert we shared a cannoli.  We asked before ordering the cannoli if it was made with custard or was it made the right way.  The proper response?  \"The right way.\"  Yummy and rich enough that you have to share.  The service from our server Kyle was outstanding and one of the managers, Darren also made sure we were receiving excellent treatment.  All in all, an excellent experience and we'll be back.  They take reservations for parties of 5 or more if you call before 4."}
{"text":"I work in the area, heard so much about grimaldi's from fellow yelpers....  I decided to stop in for lunch...  I ordered the personal/small cheese pizza...  Looked really good when it first came out....  Its cooked in a coal fired oven creates a lot of heat and cooks the pizza rather quickly...  I felt this pizza was decent,, looked much better than it tasted..  The sauce and cheese were very good, with me its all about the dough.  I was satisfied with my lunch, ate 2 slices and gave away the rest at the office...  In my opinion, this place serves decent pizza, my taste buds must be different than other reviews that loved this joint..  Try it if you want, i have had better and wont be back ...  Hope this yelps..."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, it was fairly busy and I really do wish the restaurant was bigger to accommodate more people. After a 20 min wait we were seated. Our waiter was amazing, super friendly and funny. The pizza here is always delicious and their cheesecake  is also great!"}
{"text":"Karen was our server tonight and she was on point with everything. The pizza was awesome and celebration for GEORGE's 21st birthday continued."}
{"text":"Tuesday 1040 pizza special. $10.40 for a large cheese. Too busy guys. 3 things you need to run a restraunt. People, food and equipment. Oven couldn't keep up. Our pizza was raw on the bottom, also thought the dough mixer couldn't keep up. It's called green dough. Not enough time to proof. Whoever came up with this promo should be fired. We will be back."}
{"text":"As usual, the best pizza in town. 3 of us swallowed up 2 18inch pizzas , and a salad. Nadia, our waitress was excellent and smokin'. 50 bucks, no big deal."}
{"text":"This is just personal preference but I don't like the big open seating arrangement of this restaurant. There are a bunch of tables in the middle of the restaurant and I like sitting in booths with at least a little bit of privacy for conversation. The wait staff was young and very nice and I was offered for samples of 2 wines before I ordered which I appreciated. The sauvignon blanc blend was delicious and I will definitely order it again. We ordered the chicken pesto pizza with spinach and tomato. The pizza and the crust was perfect, but the chicken was on the rubbery/bland side so for this reason I would order something different on the next visit. I definitely prefer this place over Oregano's - but I do consider it a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing amazing. .. food and service. Fresh ingredients . Highly recommend this to the locals. I happen to be just visiting a friend and he recommended we come here and boy am I glad."}
{"text":"Finally decide to check out Grimaldi's after walking by many times.  The pizza itself we would give four stars; decent thin crust with good spices and flavoring. However, for value I would give it one star.  Pizzas are overpriced to begin with, and then their policy to charge the same price for toppings whether they are for half or whole pizzas was ridiculous. We paid $8 extra for a half pepperoni half chicken pizza.  It is clear they care more about gouging customers then treating them fairly.  With all the pizza places out there, we definitely won't be returning to Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I can only speak to my experiences here, and for the most part, they have been great.  It appears many of the low-star reviews have to do with service and the price of the food.  Like I said, I've never had bad or particularly slow service here.  The ONE time, we had a party of 20 on a busy night when the rest of the restaurant was full too.  Was it slow getting the food?  Yes, but we totally expected that.  As to price, all I can say is, for the quality of the pizza, it's not bad.  I might, MIGHT, give this place 5-stars if they lowered their prices but as it stands it's still a very good pizza.  It's not a New York slice, so despite the name, don't expect that.  It's not the same as the original Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, so don't expect that either.  But you get a solid thin crust pizza that holds up to being held in the hand (as opposed to flopping over immediately and losing all your toppings.)  The ingredients are very good quality and the flavors are balanced well for a pizza, veering towards a little salty, which is fine.  It's a pizza.  I particularly like their sauce.  They don't over do it on the cheese (which has nice drag) and the crust has a nice chew.  Little blisters on the crust and the smoky bottom point to a well seasoned oven and a pretty darn good crust.  Possibly a little stingy on the toppings, but I get it.  They have a business to run.  And the pizza still tastes great, so there.  4-star pizza joint, not a 5 though.  My New York wife also heartily approves.  And she's had it all."}
{"text":"What a crust!    OK so it's from a small chain pizzeria.  But hey, this is Vegas, this is the Strip.  They are going to copy the NY original like no other place else can.  Classic 1200 degree coal burning ovens, formulated water with identical pH and mineral content of NYC water (not sure if this is a good thing).  All leads to what is undoubtedly one of the best NYC style pizza crust.  It's blistered,  well seasoned, just the right thinness with the perfect chew, with the perfect hint of smoky bitterness.    Dirt cheap for the Strip.  $9 for a personal 12\" red sauce pie $10 for a garlic white sauce or pesto.  Add $2 per topping including some great spiced meatballs, sweet Italian Sausage (American style), tender oven roasted peppers and milky mozzarella.  Mild intensity to any of the sauces to let the toppings show through.  Calzones are excellent.  Same great dough as the pies, same great filling in a hand held pouch.  True NYC pizzeria feel with the manager, hostess, and bartenders loudly shooting the breeze right at the door (when it's not too busy).    A well chosen  selection of wines focusing on Italy, most offered by the glass or half carafe (500ml or 2/3 of a whole bottle).  Reasonable prices.  Half off all wines on Tuesdays.  A welcome, affordable addition to the Palazzo."}
{"text":"I've taken away a star because, although I still love the pizza, the service is ALWAYS subpar.  For instance, tonight we sat for fifteen minutes before the waitress realized that she forgot about us.  Then, once the pizza came, we weren't checked on once... my glass remained empty for the entirety of the dinner.  When we asked for the check, the waitress looked at us with this confused look.  Apparently she thought we already paid... turns out, she charged someone else's card for our pizza.  It was a MESS.  It's always like this.  We've had several meals comped for bad service over the last couple of years.  In fact, I can't actually say that I remember EVER having exceptional service here.  Step it up, Grimaldi's!  I love you, but you gotta earn that fifth star!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a pie as soon as I read that they had a coal oven.   The pizza had a  perfect thin crust and incredible tasting sauce.  I would tweak it with a little more olive oil and more sauce but that would be a 6 star rating.  Maybe they would tweak it for me if I ask? The service was very good and my daughter loved the cannoli.  I ate to much for dessert but next time I will save some room to try the cheese cake to see how New York it is.  Nice pictures of Brooklyn and the Rat Pack.  The lights would be better off as Chianti bottles."}
{"text":"Staff was nice. Bottom of pizza tasted like charcoal. Other than that not bad for the family."}
{"text":"In the world of pizza, Grimaldi's is an institution.  They have over 100 years of coal fired brick oven pizza making traditions. It is a truly authentic pizza. The coal fire bakes a crisp crust that you can't replicate in an oven.  The fresh ingredients and high quality cheese are the best.    It's my favorite pizza outside of NYC.  I suggest the white pie with grilled chicken and fresh tomatoes and a traditional pie with your favorite toppings.  Add a caesar salad for good measure.  Service is good and the atmosphere is fantastic.  The staff and crowd has a good vibe full of happy energy.   I break my gluten free diet for this place."}
{"text":"I like the Grimaldi's on Rainbow Blvd. better and would only go to the Palazzo location if I was staying there.   After 4 visits I can say the pizza crust is consistently mushy in the center and doesn't deliver the crisp first bite that makes me think the oven is not seasoned properly.   Service is fine and the ingredients are just as tasty as the other locations.  The dining room layout is a little odd because of the long corridor before the main dining room."}
{"text":"Nearly every review boasts about the pizza and the crust, so naturally we expected Grimaldi's to live up to the hype. We were unequivocally let down.  I'm not one to normally give one star reviews, but in every aspect the food was was disappointing and the service was fake-friendly and slightly cold. For the price of the food and the ambiance of the restaurant, the menu lacked diversity and our pizza definitely lacked flavor, was not crispy, was very heavy, and most of the toppings were bland.  To start, you choose what type and size of pizza you prefer. Then you add what we thought were pretty high priced toppings, which are priced the same regardless of whether they whole or half-pizza toppings. Honestly, it didn't seem fair to pay anywhere between $3 and $5 for a single topping, despite the pizza size, but we did it anyway because we didn't want a pizza with only one or two toppings.  The pizza kitchen and oven are in the dining room, so the food preparation can be seen; including flying dough and oven operation. Pizzas were constantly leaving the kitchen and ours soon ensued. I will give them credit for the size of the pizzas; the small is huge, leaving me to wondering how enormous the large must be.  Anyway, the onto the pizza itself. It's great that they make their own mozzarella in house, but the cheese was extremely rubbery and made for a experience full of gnawing and attempts at getting a clean bite. Even with a fork and knife, the cheese and crust were difficult to get through. The chicken seemed packaged and possibly previously frozen and the rest of the toppings were mediocre at best.  The crust, which we had such high hopes for based on the reviews, was the exact opposite of what a thin crust should have been. The crust lacked rigidity and crisp, couldn't hold up its own toppings, and was fairly dense. After my first slice, I took another and merely ate about half the toppings (aside from the chicken), left the thick crust underneath, and snacked on the crispy outer edge of the slice.  All in all we were disappointed in the service and really let down with the food. After the pizza was brought to our table, our waitress very quickly checked on our meal and I don't think showed up again until it was time for the check. The prices are high, but I guess the portions are large enough to share with several people. We were glad we had a coupon, but we will be trying a different shop on our next pizza outing."}
{"text":"I just spent 2 hours at this place for an expensive pizza. We were jammed like sardines in a corner, I asked for another table, there was plenty of space but was told NO. So instead of enjoying a night out with a group it just turned into an thoroughly uncomfortable, mediocre meal with poor service. The good thing is it was my first time and also my last time."}
{"text":"This is a great place for quality NY style thin crust pizza!!!! They use fresh ingredients, handmade mozzarella, 'secret recipe' dough and pizza sauce. They keep it simple and it works great for them!!!  I usually come in during happy hour and sit at the bar. The wait time for pizza is not bad approx. 20 minutes on a crowded night. The service is outstanding I've never had a bad moment. Especially when Andrea is around, she's super cool and friendly."}
{"text":"With so many Pizza options in Las Vegas Grimaldi's is always a great choice. We had a large pie with meatballs and it was cooked perfectly and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Love this place! I came her with two other friends for the first time and we loved it!! I can't tell you what we ordered because being outnumbered two guys to one girl I had no say, so the boys customized and added the works! which was ok because I'm not picky at all! I can tell you we did order a pizza and some sort of calzone, and that Lindsay, our server from Chicago, was an absolute sweet heart and was so patient, and friendly with both my knuckle headed friends!!   The pizza though was delicious!! Half of our pizza was some sort of BBQ chicken while the other half was some sort of meat lovers. Again, I don't know what they ordered  but it was amazing!! The calzone too was great, it had slight hints of jalapeño which gave it some nice heat which paired nicely with all of the ricotta cheese inside! It was amazing! And can I just add that they also play FRANK SINATRA!! totally awesome!! Our Server was wonderful, the ambience is comfortable, the food is amazing and we had a great time!!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend are here at least once a week. Probably the best pizzeria you can go eat in NEVADA.  I love the atmosphere you could dine inside and outside patio. Located in a perfect spot in summerlin. IF There's a issue with your pizza they WILL remake it immediately. They Strive on providing best customer service. The waiters are awesome, pizza tastes good, it is pricey but. It's definitely worth it. Everyone must try Grimaldi's once-in-a-lifetime. The toppings actually tasted fresh & cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"My boyfriend mentioned this was one the best pizzas he's had in New York though lol we decided to try it out. The lovely upbeat host sat us right away. The server came in we ordered right away we were super hungry lol food arrived decent time. Not to mention I Hate trying new things. Well.... holy shit hands down best pizza ever !!!!!!!!! Ps. If you subscribe for their emails you will get 5$ off and free pizza on your birthday!!     One more thing just know that customers see everything. While we waited for our pizza mostly all servers were just chillen sitting down all gathered around where they cook the pizza talking to the cooks seemed like they were just not even on the clock ! Anyway. Just a little FYI. Looks wrong."}
{"text":"I originally ate at their Brooklyn location about 7 years ago & since learning that there was one in the Palazzo, I've been frequenting this one every couple years when I get the chance. This past weekend I tried placing a to go order and it was super sweet and simple and the pizzas were just as amazing as dine-in. I was in and out in no time and I raced to my room a few hotels down to devour them with my roommates. Always reliable for a good pizza on the strip!"}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door. The sever was at the bar was very friendly and the pizza was delicious. Tastes amazing."}
{"text":"It was good but I like Dominos equally! I came in late and they obviously weren't happy about that"}
{"text":"Brian is the best bartender/waiter and ensures you have the best food!! their pizzas beat everybody else's"}
{"text":"I can't remember ever having a better pizza experience. I'm an east coast NY/NJ guy used to great pizza. The ingredients in these pies are so fresh the pizza just sings! Pepperoni and garlic my personal fave."}
{"text":"we love grimaldis since new york. the crust is beautifully thin and chewy. this round, i ordered anchovies on the pizza and it added a nice touch to the flavor. decor wise, its the nicest decor. and plenty of tables. love their take our servie as well. stay at the palazzo hotel and you can just go downstairs to eat pizza."}
{"text":"To someone not knowing better, the crowd would indicate that this place is out of this world.  Maybe in a place short on options for pizza, it is.  Since I hail from a town full of Italian immigrants with more great pizza joints than there are gas stations, I wasn't blown away.    So, here's how it went.  There was to be a wait for our table so we made our way up to the bar and ordered a round of drink.  All were served up in a tall glass, but were overly watered down.  The bartender was efficient and attentive, though.    Soon our table became available and we were seating smack in the middle of the main walkway with servers navigating around us all evening.    The menu quickly narrows your options.  No, don't flip it over!  That really is all there is to choose from. Pizza, calzones and a few salads.  Although, there ARE numerous pizza toppings to tack on to your thin crust coal fired oven pizza.     We ordered the caprese salad which was plenty enough to share.  The antipasto is strictly some meats  and cheese laid on the plate with a small assortment of olives and some roasted red peppers.  This is fine, if you're expecting it.    Two personal size pizzas is plenty for four hungry women.  I most enjoyed the ricotta, fresh tomato and pesto combo myself.  Yet, then again, those are three of my favorites.  So pick three of your favorites (or more) and you're likely to come up with a pizza that isn't bad.  The dough isn't memorable and the bottom seemed a tad ashy.    The dessert menu follows suit with the dinner menu adhering to few options including a variety of cheesecakes, a cannoli and tiramisu.  I opted for the plain cheesecake, which was pretty darn good.  It was not overly dense nor was it whipped into a airy substance.   Service isn't stellar, the pizzas are generously sized.  Just add good company!"}
{"text":"February 2018.  Lunch was super!  We had pizza and salad with Pellegrino to drink.  Our server was extremely attentive to our every need.  This restaurant has seating inside and outside the restaurant.  We choose to sit outside.  The music can still be heard and the tables are comfortable.  We will be back next year!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I come here for the service and the food. Not to mention this place is in a great location!!!! Waiters are awesome every time I come in !"}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided to try a new place and boy we were not disappointed. We went in wanting pasta and noticed that they only have pizza and salads but wow, I can see why! They have the best tasting pizza that I have ever had and their spinach salad was awesome! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 67/100  I went here a few nights ago with a few friends to redeem the free birthday pizza which is actually, getting $19 off your choice of pizza and additional charge for additional toppings. Which isn't a bad deal.   We sat closest to the kitchen so we had a great view of the pizza making process. I'm always fascinated to see how things are made, especially pizza!   We had the kale salad and a large pizza with little slices of pepperoni, sausage, and ricotta.  For me, the kale salad was okay. It was a mix of curly kale, romaine, drenched in a lemon vinaigrette & a few slices of lemon. I don't like too much dressing on my salad.   My friends seem to like it. It just depends on your eating habits. I tend to enjoy healthier salads. I liked the option to drizzle fresh squeezed lemon.   I expected the pizza to be better, because I hear people raving about it all the time. I didn't like the crust. The pizza toppings were great, and they gave a great amount of toppings. But the slices were too big and too heavy to fold & hold and it made the crust soggy, so I used a fork and knife. Bummed because I prefer to hold my pizza while I eat it. While eating the last couple slices the dough was hard to chew so I ended up just eating the toppings.   I loved the black and white photos on the wall, the ambiance, and bottle light fixtures. Server was fast and checked in with us every so often.   My expectations weren't high for this place because it's a chain but I thought it would be better than what I experienced. Willing to give it another chance but with other pizza places on my to-try list it will be a while before I come back to this place."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday. First time here not bad. Showed up at 4, I wouldn't recommend that. They clean the coal brick ovens between 4-5, so we hung out drinking for an hour. Overall pizza was ok. Next time maybe we try a different one other than the typical red sauce. Salad was good too!"}
{"text":"Love the environment. Great waiter Nick. Super friendly, infectious smile!"}
{"text":"ZERO stars if available on YELP.  DO not GO here!!!! Beware of the crooked take out pick up at Bar and count all of your items. They short ordered me a 12 buck salad that I was charged for.  To top it off, the damn plain cheese pizza tasted like it was made of a piece of the top cover of the box with a bit of cheese and literally no flavors or sauce.  WORST than elementary school cafeteria lunch.  Maybe it was good they cheated me out of my salad...if it tasted anything like the pizza, then better we didn't have it.  Let's count the days they will remain at this location. DONT be foolish to even walk by this place and consider it. They make DOMINOS taste like Spagos."}
{"text":"Incredible NY style, thin crust pizza.... we got ours with pepperoni, sausage, garlic and mushrooms - perfection.  My fiancé and I shared a small pizza, and though I have a huge appetite, we still had left overs.  I love this location.  It's further from the strip, which is great actually.  There isn't a chaotic loud feel to it. Parking is easy.  It would be a nice place for a date.  Cool, classy atmosphere, but not stuffy.  Our server was very helpful, the manager the best."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had in a very long time. I usually think pizzas are overpriced and overrated, but this pizza is worth it. We ordered spicy chicken sausage and green peppers as toppings -- it really was amazing.   The service is a little slow and with no good reason (it wasn't busy). But it is open late and is worth the wait. Fate."}
{"text":"I know I'm hard on pizzerias. I'm gonna preface my review by saying this; Grimaldi's is... different. I don't mean it's a bad place; it's actually a really good pizzeria. It's just coal fire pizza. That's not something I'm particularly accustomed to. It is however not a bad approach. I'll always be a diehard brick oven proponent. To a pizza maker/connoisseur, it's more drastic than a Pepsi vs. Coke argument. It's more like Charcoal vs. Gas grills, American vs Foreign cars, Macs vs. PCs, or Revolvers vs. Semi-Auto pistols. It's just a fundamentally different approach. But I can actually appreciate it for what it is.   The decor is nice and classy for a pizzeria. Like a more upscale old school NY pizza joint. The quality of ingredients are high. I order different things now and then. I really like the meatball and ricotta toppings. Being coal oven pizza, you still get a pretty crispy pie. Sometimes, the crust is too crispy though, even for me. And since this is all the nature of the beast with coal ovens, the toppings aren't always piping hot. But it all has a really good flavor to it. And the service is outstanding. If you sit at the bar you might have Audrey serving you. She's a good friend, and she's pretty awesome. Tell her I sent you, if she's there when you go. The manager is pretty cool too! I would definitely recommend giving this place a try, if you have any interest in pizza whatsoever. If you are diehard like me, and from back east... you may be more critical. Just look at it as something a little different and appreciate it for what it is. You might actually love it. I've put it in my pizza rotation, and I think that says a lot. Oh and by the way, they unfortunately don't deliver."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is one of the best places to get your thin crust pizza fix. We love the pepperoni & cheese pizza. And we love that the kids get to have dough to play with.  We walked in and did not have to wait on Monday night always a clean restaurant always courteous customer service and just a great place to hang out. Come and check it out!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I have ever ate. Service was great as well."}
{"text":"The pizzas were not as good as usual. They had barely any toppings for the $44 for the 2 larges we ordered. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pretty Cool place to be. Family oriented, date night or just to hangout with company or by yourself. The small salads are really for 2 people or a dinner by yourself. House salad great, so is the spinach salad. We had the Pesto Pizza build your own, it was spectacular!!  Vince the manager was awesome and so was the bartender! Check it out, it's worth it! Prices are great!"}
{"text":"Actually kind of surprised this place has such good reviews. It seemed average to me, the staff though is AMAZING, they're super nice and I totally felt welcome like a friend. The outside patio area is so cute, very close together so it's almost like you don't want to have a conversation because of easy eavesdropping...   I was shocked everything was so \"fancy\" on the menu for the quality which seemed normal to me and for the price and I'm from Scottsdale. It's not an \"I just want pizza\" place, seems like an acquired taste to be honest. The sauce is so super super thin, I had to ask myself several times if there was any sauce. I also asked for garlic and stared at my pizza trying to find it. The crust is like paper, I don't even know... don't get the appeal. I mean I love thin crust but this was crazy.   I also ordered my large pizza with pepperoni and meatball, the pizza was warm but the meatballs were cold, not sure how that happens... to make a long story short my friend and I had only eaten that (and drank water) thus far that day and we both got diarrhea... a few times with aching stomachs. YES, I just said that. No idea what that was about, but it seemed like food poisoning. I got very nauseated myself as well."}
{"text":"GRIMALDI's PIZZERIA has a lot going for them with tools and technique at the top of the list. to my sensibilities, a coal fired oven really produces the perfect crust and, at least in my experience, GRIMALID's consistantly does it well.  but the quality of their toppings is really no different than the national chains that dispatch pimple-faced kids to your doorstep when you're too tired to drag your ass to a \"real\" restaurant and that's kind of disappointing.  and i can't say i'm wild about their sauce either. theirs is raw (and \"lightly drizzled\" over the other toppings so the crust stays crispy) and i'm partial to a long-simmered version -- i enjoy the additional depth of flavor.  so, the quest for the perfect pizza goes on ..."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if our pizza was made incorrectly, or if since the last time we've had it the recipe has changed but we spent $20 on a pizza the other night and it didn't taste the same, didn't taste good. No one enjoyed it at all and we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"AMAZING coal brick oven pizza !! Don't live far from here so when my boyfriend and I feel like eating something good this is our GO TO!!! I hear this is as close as New York pizza as you can get. You walk right in and see the hard working pizza flipping chefs at work through their see through glass. Also try their amazing wine bar or sit outside to enjoy the weather. We order take out and we dine in. There are times when they stoke (clean) their oven so they don't take orders at the time so they usually ask you too wait an hour or so. All the times we have dined in the food has been delicious and their Cesar salad is DA BOMB  the waiters there are very helpful and very kind. We had asked for a pepperoni pizza and we never got them. I brought it to my waiters attention and he came back with a BOWL of pepperoni. I WAS IN LOVE! Pepperonis are my favorite  and did I forget to mention their Antipasto ??? Comes with salami, peppers, DELISIOUS fresh mozerlla, olives, and slices of bread. Must try and MUST VISIT. I hope this reviewed helped. Enjoy"}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Grimaldi's and it was a great experience! The two of us ordered a large pizza and wine. I love thin crust pizza so I was really happy with our order.   It was obvious that the pizza and toppings were fresh. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We bring out of towners here to show off having good pizza in AZ. We celebrate birthdays here. Great place, good beer."}
{"text":"THEE best pizza in Vegas!! Ny style thin crust is my fav. Ordered the 4cheese pizza with garlic and mushrooms. Can't go wrong with any toppings. 5 stars every time I eat there."}
{"text":"I didn't know that Grimaldi's was known for its thin crust pizza when I chose it; I picked it because it was close to our hotel and had high ratings from a fair number of reviews. My husband and I just arrived and were tired and hungry so this seemed easy.  I was relieved that there was no wait for two people. The restaurant on a Sunday evening around 8 was bustling but not too crowded. We were seated promptly on their little \"patio.\"   To start, we ordered a 1/2 carafe of one of the Sangiovese wines and a Mediterranean salad. We asked for the large, but the waitress helpfully told us that a small salad was enough for two people so we got that, then placed an order for a personal size Margherita pizza.   Wine- it was okay. I'm not a connoisseur by any means but I've had wines that I prefer to this one. Still, it did the trick after a long day of driving! $18 for the half carafe, which was about two and half glasses. Since one glass was $7, I'm not entirely sure how good a deal that was.  Mediterranean salad- ~$6. romaine lettuce, kalamata olives, feta cheese, tomato, cucumber, and red onion with some type of vinaigrette on top. The small was sufficient although we probably could have finished a large. This was average; the dressing was kind of bland, the lettuce not great and the pieces of feta were pretty small.   Margherita pizza- $12. I enjoyed the pizza overall; both the sauce and crust were well seasoned. The thin crust was nice except that it unevenly cooked. One side was burned while the other side was almost underdone. So...points off for that.   The service was excellent. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. I didn't regret choosing Grimaldi's but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my to eat there again."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has one of the best perks for your birthday!  If you are on the email list, you will get an email a little before your birthday, which can be used before or after within a few days! It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza!   This essentially gets you a large one topping, or a large white with garlic, and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!  I enjoy Grimaldi's charcoal style ovens, which add a nice flavor to the super thin crust and toppings. The pepperoni and sausage combo was a bit on the greasy end, but a little grease is a good thing!  The white pizza is amazing, with chunks of garlic hiding in there!  Service was pretty slow during lunchtime at the bar.  They only had one server for the entire bar area, AND she had tables in the dining area.  Not a huge deal to me since I wasn't in a hurry that day, but keep it in mind in case this wasn't an \"off\" day for them.  I'll be back at some point, but for sure next year for my birthday!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has one of the best perks for your birthday!  If you are on the email list, you will get an email a little before your birthday, which can be used before or after within a few days! It is essentially an $18 coupon for a large pizza!   This essentially gets you a large one topping, or a large white with garlic, and you pay for additional toppings or anything else above and beyond!

{"text":"The pizza is incredible especially the pesto based! I built my own and had Sausage, onions ( grilled prior) jalapeños and fresh basil! Sooo good! I sat at bar and Kurt the bartender never steared me wrong! Had the dessert trio as well! Incredible! Oreo cheesecake was my fave. Very popular for takeout too.  Great outdoor patio and bar."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went on a date here a while back and it was nothing short of perfect. We sat on the back patio and had pizza & wine--both were fabulous. The waitress was really sweet, and the place surprisingly had a lot of ambiance. Grimaldi's really makes you feel like you're somewhere other than Old Town.  Overall, I would recommend this place to almost anyone."}
{"text":"Impressive every time  Have been back a few times since my last review.  Visited yesterday and all is still excellent.  Pizzas remain incredibly yummy, service is fast and kind, and it's an excellent choice when you have kids.  The dough they give younglings to play with keeps them occupied and is a winner of an idea.  We had one boo-boo where the server mixed up my little girl's order.  The manager immediately came out, apologized, and said it was on them.  An occasional error happens and I told him that was nice to offer, but not necessary.    TIP: We ordered a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Cheesecake to share for dessert-- makes you want to say Hallelujah after each bite.    The bill came and both my daughter's meal and the dessert were credited back.  I made it up on the tip side, but it was a forthright gesture that the place wants to nail the dining experience every time.  NICE!"}
{"text":"Great pizza + Pretty good service + Bad table  I'm an admitted fan of Grimaldi's.  They have the best white pizza with garlic I've ever had, even better with some Italian sausage added.  This location is in the DC Ranch area with a number of good eateries. We were there for some family photos as it's a five spot for many photographers.  We planned on dinner afterward.  The restaurant arrangement is more close and intimate than the Peoria location. The waitress was very nice, albeit slow and leaving us stranded for drink refills.  Food was excellent and on target with the Grimaldi menu-- excellent pizza and the seasonal cheesecake is always a hit.  One knock on the experience was our table was near the rear door.  A family with lots of kids was using it as an exit to play in the park area nearby.  In and out.  In and out.  After about 30 minutes, the temperature had dropped to the low-60s, making our little ones (and food) cold. The waitress didn't notice or help and I had to talk to one of the parents to see if the group of kids could traverse less often and be gentler with the door since it was two feet from our baby's high chair.  As long as you don't get that table and you get a person who checks on you, I'm sure this Grimaldi's will be great.  I'm giving them three stars instead of two on faith since we usually have great experiences at the chain."}
{"text":"Good pizza with less wait  My wife and I are big fans of Grimaldi's.  Best white pizza we've ever had, especially when you add sausage and tomatoes.    We stopped in at the Kierland store due to the wait at all the other restaurants being much longer.  Had some extra time after a movie and we didn't anticipate waits of 30 minutes to two hours for a table for two at the other spots.  No problem at Grimaldi's, where we took a seat at the bar.  Service was good and pizza was fine.  However, my wife and I both commented that the pizza was not as flavorful than we are used to at the Westgate location.  Could be we just got an off day.  Still, it's hard to give a four-star rating when it's inconsistent with what we are accustomed to... We eat at Grimaldi's about twice a month.  I'll give them another try at some point to see if we can increase the score."}
{"text":"I would give a better star rating if anyone at the table liked anything entirely but the food got a neutral pass by all.   Paper thin meatballs??!! What is a flat meatball?!! Sounds defective to me. Pizza was too thin and expensive, I understand the concept of thin pizza just don't charge loaded deep dish prices please!  It is clean and a lot of people did seem to like the place, but it didn't fly for us. Canned mushrooms at extra cost? Canned?! The Stromboli had almost nothing in it. Service was not over the top, you may have to wait just to get seated here. The parking lot can fill up quickly too as there are a lot of little places in this section.  The main thing here were the prices, much too high for the amount of food. Everything seems to have an upcharge. It is good just not the best. In our opinion we expected more NYC kick.. but nope,  we got more of a tourist trap Vegas... :(  Enough people seem to like it so give it a shot and make your own decision."}
{"text":"Great pizza  Great service! I love how I can get unlimited root beer to go with my mozzarella ! It's rare come across a Grimaldi's other than NYC. I was overjoyed to see two in Vegas."}
{"text":"I want to give 5* but the last few times we have gone! the pizza is too floppy. Maybe some new hires need retraining? I love the pizza (pepperoni & ricotta) and the wine. We go weekly, so I'm hoping they get the cooking time/temp issue resolved."}
{"text":"My husband, visiting daughter, and I stopped in for pizza after shopping at San Tan Village on Saturday night Sept 3. Everyone was warm and welcoming, which sadly is often not the case for the over age 50 crowd. Service was great and so was the large mushroom pizza. The house white wine, pinot grigio, was good and reasonably priced for a generous half carafe. Ended up purchasing a $100 Gift Card which came with a $20 Bonus Card during a Customer Appreciation promo."}
{"text":"Saw cooks touching face, touching toppings with no gloves,servers touching straws with hands. Touching lemons with hands.  Pizza was great, but, you lose your appetite when you watch cooks"}
{"text":"My husband and I were wandering around Palazzo's shopping area looking for somewhere not too expensive to eat for lunch. Grimaldi's was hidden in a back corner and we almost missed it but the pizza smelled really good and I'm glad we stopped! We split a Caesar salad and a small pizza and it was plenty! The service was very attentive for any restaurant let alone a mall restaurant and faster than I expected for pizza. The salad was dressed perfectly. Honestly: it was awesome! After 2 days in Vegas it was exactly what I needed. Green, big, lemony, lots of parmesan, and crunchy. The pizza was made exactly how we ordered it. We loved the thin, chewy crust. I don't feel like it was burned at all. It held the toppings well. Fresh mushrooms, salty kalamata olives, spicy pepperoni, fresh-tasting cheese, sauce that wasn't from a can, and subtle Italian spices makes for a perfect pizza in my opinion. If we stay in the northern Strip area again next time we come I plan on eating here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza. Caesar salad also good. I was impressed how easily they dealt with our party of 18+, with the food coming out quickly and no problems splitting the check."}
{"text":"I'm happy to over pay for great pizza if the service is prompt and the glasses of beer are big.  I had The Don pizza and it was very good.  Sadly, the service was slow in a less than half full restaurant, the beer glasses were tiny and 1/3 was foam.  I would have been better off going to Domino's and stopping at 7-11 for beer."}
{"text":"the service was disgusting. the waitress was a smart ass (which my family usually is) but she was outright rude, she walked away every time my father spoke specifically, and treated us with disrespect when she spoke back. I wouldn't go back just because of her."}
{"text":"Rude staff and crappy soggy pizza. Save your money and go somewhere where the people are more considerate."}
{"text":"Ah, eating here made me reminiscent of NYC.   I remember going to Grimaldi's the first time and loved it! If you want true thin crust NYC pizza, you can definitely get it at Grimaldi's!  The restaurant is located in the Palazzo among the flashy stores and this establishment itself is nice and has patio seating.  They're also open til 2AM which is a plus!   The menu is typical Grimaldi's pizza or salad.  Pizza selections include a regular pizza, pizza with pesto, white pizza with garlic or a calzone.  There's a variety of toppings you can select from including sun dried tomatoes, artichokes, italian sausage, ham and sweet red peppers just to name a few.  We opted for the small white pizza with garlic, italian sausage, kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes. This was delicious and the small comes with big slices! I think there were six slices total.  They were generous with the toppings as well. We both loved the olives (and yay we didn't get any pits!).    Our server was great, very energetic and enthusiastic.  Food came out fairly quick (granted it was later in the evening 11PMish).  Love Grimaldi's and was happy to get a taste of NYC on the west!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Grimaldi's when I had it in Vegas, so when I saw one in Scottsdale, I had to get me some.  I called to order take out for lunch on a Friday and I was on hold for awhile before anyone took my order.  But once I ordered, it was only going to take 25-30 min for my food to be ready.  The restaurant is easy to spot in old town.  I arrived on time and was told to pick up my order at the bar.  There was only one person working, so I had to wait to pay.  My order wasn't ready either, so I had to wait some more.  The pizza sadly wasn't as good as I remembered.  I ordered two personal 12\" pizzas, one with pepperoni ($12) and another with meatball and ricotta ($15).  For such a basic like pepperoni, it was just okay.  They also skimped on the toppings on the meatball pizza and it was sloppily put together.     Maybe dining in the restaurant makes a difference, but I wouldn't do take out again.  Their pizza is not cheap and I was expecting more from them."}
{"text":"If you love a good thin crusted NY style pizza, you have to come here when you're in Vegas.  Between 5 people, we ordered 2 large pizzas and a large salad.  It was plenty to share amongst us.  We even had a couple slices leftover to take for late night munchies.  Their Caesar Salad ($10/ large) is one of the best I've had. The greens were fresh, crisp and not drenched in dressing. The croutons were crunchy, but not too hard.  A good choice for a starter.  The Brooklyn Bridge ($24/ large) pizza is a must get.  It's a traditional pizza with red peppers, sausage and most importantly... ricotta cheese!  The ricotta adds a rich creaminess to the pizza that is drool worthy.  Our second pizza was a simple meatball and pepperoni, but it had really good flavor.  These people know how to do pizza.  Their  crust to sauce to toppings ratio is on point.  You can taste the quality and the prices are not bad. This is becoming one of my go-to places in Vegas."}
{"text":"For such a thin pizza, it's really overpriced. I ordered extra cheese as a topping, and it was barely any cheese on the pizza.  The pizza is much different from what I am usually used to.   They have only a few items to choose from on the menu, like salad and pizza choices only.   If it gets cold it pretty much has to be thrown out because it gets really hard even when heated up.   Great thing about this place is that they use a coal oven. That's really good, it always makes pizza better.   The pizza was decent, but just not my type."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on our visit to Vegas. We definitely was not disappointed. We have ate at the Grimaldis under the brooklyn bridge and this was certainly comparable to that. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and the antipasto. They were both delicious. The service was great and best of all there was no wait. Will definitely come back the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Ever!  Okay..probably not..but it's damn good! Fresh pizza made to order with whatever toppings you wants. I dont know if its the dough, the sauce or the incredible toppings but the combination of it all works! And works well! I'm glad it didnt take me too long after moving to vegas to find this place!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.   This place is the best pizza I have found in Las Vegas so far.   Tried other yelp recommended places and they fell short.   Great thin crust and salads are fresh.   The price is not cheap but not expensive either, one note is expect to wait if you come for dinner and come after 5:30.   Worth the wait in my opinion though."}
{"text":"How are there not more 5's!??!  Best pizza that has EVER EVER EVER touched my lips! Try pepperoni and ricotta as toppings and you won't regret it.  My boyfriend loves it now.  My last trip to NYC included a visit to the original in Brooklyn.  That was a lot of fun, but I'll say the version in PHX is even better!   People like to have rehearsal dinners or even weddings here.  Cute place.  Good first date.   GO."}
{"text":"if you like thin crust pizza this is the place to go to...but be prepared to spend some extra bucks when dining here..also I recommend ordering the biggest pizza if you come here in a group because the toppings are the same price whether you order a small or large..(I think that's how they get you) but still this place is one of my favorite eats"}
{"text":"Let me start by disclosing that  I am NOT a fan of pizza. When I came here for a family function in their private room I was secretly hoping they would have salad. I was not disappointed. Everything on the buffet was good, from the salads to the pesto penne and penne vodka. When I went back for more penne vodka, all of the food had been devoured so we ordered a few pizzas. The pizza was good, although it wasn't the best pizza I've had. I prefer a thinner crust and more salt. I did like that it was not too heavy on tomato sauce and it was not greasy.  Now, the desserts were awesome. The tiramisu was delicious and the cannoli were so good I had three of them.  The place was pretty lively and if I lived in Phoenix I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great ! It's right at ParkWest shopping center & near the movie theater for any date night-- Good any day of the week except Friday - it's super busy!"}
{"text":"Poor service. I came I  was asked to come back in 45 minutes and said no problem I will. Came back and was told it was a 45 minute wait. Spoke with the manager who said they could seat us in about 20 minutes (as she had open tables behind us.) NEVER TAKE HUNGRY CHILDREN HERE or expect to be treated well."}
{"text":"The white pizza was a waste of money. Service was excellent. Don't order the white pizza though...  I have been in before and had the regular pizza and it was good."}
{"text":"Meal #5 of 2017 Las Vegas Trip  I have been to the Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and love it, and was pleasantly surprised when I went to this location at The Palazzo. I was worried it would be food court garbage like (I assume) Di Fara's (at Caesars Palace) is. Pretty much the opposite of food court garbage, this place is sit down and actually has a nicer ambiance than the original, though I still missed the original Grimaldi's collection of signed photos of dubious \"celebrities\" over the years.  Also, just like our trip to the Brooklyn mothership, my daughter was a big cranky pants and wanted to go to the bathroom just as the pizza arrived.   Skip the trio of bruschettas. They were really in need of olive oil, a spread, or some kind of sauce because they were so dry the ingredients just fell off. The mushrooms with garlic had way too much raw garlic. The artichokes were okay as were the tomatoes with parmesan. All I could think of was the bruschetta I make is better.  The pizza was the star of the show. It was Uh. Maze. Ing. They use fresh mozz, and the tomato sauce is nicely sweet.

{"text":"Located in a cute little open-air shopping district, it has a comfortable ambience. The menu is super simple - salad, pizza, dessert, beverages. We had pizza & tried a couple different salads, both of which were not disappointing. If you love pizza & can appreciate just a salad & drink on the side ..this might be a place for you. We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I was invited back by the General Manager Steve Dettman. He apologized for the experience. Even in a busy evening dinner service, everything was good. Salad fresh. Pizza delivered after a reasonable time after salad. Drinks constantly refilled. And desert excellent. The staff was attentive. Past problems were corrected. Thank you Steve."}
{"text":"Food still good. Service tonight not so great. Only 5 tables full in the restaurant and our server couldn't manage to ask if I wanted a refill on my beer or water. My wife's soda sat empty. Jason (our waiter) did not seem to care to be attentive. There was a table the manager was talking to and he seemed to want to be more present there. On a busy night I get it. Not tonight. Once again though food was great."}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza on earth. Cocktails are not bad either, it's very hard to mess up pizza but it's even harder to make it into something more than just a pie. When you order a pizza from here you know you are getting something special. I also found it interesting that every Grimaldi's brick oven is made of bricks that are shipped over from Italy, its really a great place to grab lunch!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!  Our server Samara was lovely, and our pizza came out perfectly cooked in under 20 minutes. We ordered a double cheese and pepperoni and it did not disappoint. We could eat here every day!!"}
{"text":"If you're staying at the Palazzo, a late night to-go order of Grimaldi's is a must. They close at 2am though, so get it before it's too late. I cannot tell you how many people stopped me on my way back to the room demanding to know where I got the delicious-smelling pizza and if it's too late to get one themselves. Alas poor sirs and madams,YES it was too late for them because Grimaldi's had just closed.  Don't make the same mistake and consider making the long trek down to Secret Pizza at the Cosmo in desperate pizza envy. Call in your Grimaldi's order because it takes 20 minutes to bake in their brick oven.   The thin new-york style crust is just chewy and crispy enough. The toppings are fresh & delicious. The service was friendly and fast. I can't make a single complaint.  Comparison to the original Grimaldi's in NY: It doesn't quite live up to the high standards of the original but still delicious nevertheless. If you go with realistic expectations, you won't be disappointed.  Large pizza = $16 Each topping = +$2 Special toppings = +$4 (i.e. artichokes)  Total for a sausage, mushroom & onion pizza: ~$23 (including tax)"}
{"text":"The pizza here is not the best i have had but it is always a safe zone when I am craving pizza. I am basic when it comes to pizza so pepperoni  mushroom and sausage is the way to go for me. It enables me to enjoy the cheese and pizza sauce. Grimaldi perfected the cheese and pizza sauce in my opinion because it is very flavorful and tastes fresh. The pizza is also just as good if not better when eating the next day as left overs!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing! their tomato base sauce that the put on their pizza is very flavorful and on point. the ingredients are fresh and the pizza is still good even the next day. My only complaint about their pizza is that i wish it could be cooked a little longer so that the pizza isn't so flimsy and breaks apart so easily so usually when i order i make sure to tell them that. The price is reasonable for a delicious fresh tasting pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent brickoven pizza!. The sauce is delicious and the ingredients are very flavorful. The best thing about the pizza is that none of the ingredients overpower the others. Not too much cheese or sauce and plenty of toppings.   I work close to the one in El Segundo but never went. Now that I've gone, i'll be visiting the one near by more often."}
{"text":"Although the pizza was decent it isn't anything to wrote home about.  I would have rated it with more stars but for the price you pay for a pie I think 2 stars is about right.  You can definitely find a similar pizza here in town for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Not far from the taste of the original at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge. With a more roomy dining area. Finding better pizza in this state?? Fuhgettaboutit!"}
{"text":"This location was busy on our visit, and the pizza was five stars. The most attentive service was received from the older gentleman bartender. The overall customer service level is ok. They serve the least popular brands of beer and soda (Miller and Pepsi)."}
{"text":"3 stars for the atmosphere, but the pizza is not anything to rave about...its bland at best. The salad though, is to die for. It is very uniquely their's for sure! But their supposed to be known for their pizza's? If you not too crazy about a really good pizza, you can come here just for the experience, I guess!"}
{"text":"THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  I took my wife and son here yesterday and we will never come back here again!!  We sat at our table for 20 minutes and were completely ignored the entire time.  They were not busy, servers were talking and laughing with the hostesses and cook staff.  I even made eye contact with several servers and were not even asked for our drink order.  Puzzled as to why this was happening, my wife and I looked around the restaurant to see if we are missing something.  It took one glance to realize what was really going on, we were the only Hispanics in the restaurant.  Furious about this, we decided to leave.  As we were leaving, there were some servers talking and laughing with the cook staff and a server talking and joking with the three hostesses there.  My wife let them know how horrible the service is there, and right when that happened, one of the servers with a faux-hawk and beard came rushing up to us to ask if we've been helped.  I had made eye contact with him several times as he was hanging out talking and laughing with the cook staff and other servers, so it is beyond me as to why he waited until we were leaving to ask if we had been helped.  It is a shame that we still have establishments where racism and discrimination is acceptable."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's pizza, it is absolutely freaking delicious. My personal recommendation would be their white pizza and add some vegetables, but literally every pizza I have had here is amazing. They also have an alright selection of beers, and the place looks good inside. Now the downside is the service at the Scottsdale location is awful, I mean just awful. Last time I came here it seemed like they were beyond slow and everyone had an attitude and like they were doing me a favor by seating me and getting me food. Also it can get quite pricey, I mean its like $15-30 per pizza depending on what you order. I will stick with the location at Scottsdale Quarter as the service seems much better."}
{"text":"Great pizza, we got a free large pizza for my birthday. First time at this place and we loved it. Really nice atmosphere in the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Awesome place to get delicious pizza.  The best point is that you can customized your own pizza!!  The menu price is reasonable and the restaurant is very clean   However, the service is relatively slow.  I came for lunch during a slow day, there's not many customers. But the service is terribly slow. For this reason, a 4-stars is fair."}
{"text":"A salad had to do some heavy lifting to earn that fourth star because the pizza at Grimaldi's does not knocka my socksa off. However, the za is not greasy or heavy, and I think the sauce is solid. When it all comes together, it's a nice pie. Plus, the restaurant is nice, and they do have a fabulous patio.   My minor complaints: The crust is a bit too crispy. The cheese is not provocative. The cost is pretty pricey, which usually leads to me deciding to go with a one topping pie - never mind blowing. Plus, I find it odd that they don't have specialty pies where you can realize some savings by getting a crazy combo they've dreamed up. Is that amateur of me?  The star for me, however, is the salad. Even a house salad manages to impress with super fresh ingredients and large serving portion. I guess what I am saying is go for the za stay for the green."}
{"text":"The highlight of Grimaldi's: from my experience, they always have snazzy patios. This location is no exception. They have a half-indoor, half-outdoor bar that offers a great vista of the TV. It was the perfect spot for catching the Olympics. And, our bartender, Kurt, was a super nice fella. Plus, Tuesday nights are half-price wine, so I had a delicious red blend for $3.50/glass! On pure barability (just made up a word), this is an A+ hang.   The small house salad is enough for two if you're getting pizza, and it is simple, fresh and topped with a nice, tart dressing.   But the pizza on this night was not on. The toppings were definitely fresh, but they don't come cheap. For a large pizza with two toppings, it is at least $20. For me, that leaves me expecting a nice, gourmet pizza experience. The crust was neither tasty nor a texture hit; it was just chewy, and we weren't compelled to eat the entire crust.  The sauce was the highlight. That, and the pizza is definitely not greasy."}
{"text":"I had an odd experience at Grimaldi's. I have never had a meal start at one star level and then gradually slip into another star dimension. If I had taken one, hot bite and jumped on here to write a review, I would probably have given the pie a solid 4 stars, but that is not what happened. The pizza slowly became a hot, or rather cold, mess.   The place is cute with old wine bottle chandeliers. The bottoms are cut out, and the bulbs are contained within the bottle. They are clustered around the ceiling and are quite fascinating. It took a minute for our server to show up and greet us, and for some reason, on Saturday evening I was being a stickler for service, so that bothered me a bit. It is quite possible that the brightness of the wine bottle chandeliers made me hypersensitive. The bar area might be more comfortable.  We ordered a small salad and a large pizza with onion, garlic and jalapeno. Based on that scent profile, it is pretty obvious that I already have a man. The small salad was a huge and a good value at $5. The dressing wasn't a standout; it lacked that vinegary punch! Then the pie arrived. As I have been at other local pie joints, I was underwhelmed by the volume of toppings. I might start showing up with my own. Just start pulling baggies of onions and mushrooms at of my purse. Anyways, the first slice of the pizza was great. The sauce is a little sweet, and the crust was a tad crispy, but still with a good chew. No burnt edges, which meant I ate all of the crust. However, as the pizza started to get cold, the crust became stale.   Perhaps it is yeast or oil deprivation. The pizza was the least greasy pizza I have had in quite some time, but I would trade in a stale pizza for a big ol' greasy pizza any day of the week. Maybe we went on a weak dough day, so I am up for a revisit, but for now it is a 3.44 star deal, which sadly requires rounding down."}
{"text":"Less than average pizza pie here....no taste in the crust and hardly the pizza itself. Honestly, I could have made a better pizza at home. I will not return."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend at the Trump Hotel in Vegas across the street from the Fashion Show Mall. While in the mall I noticed Grimaldi's Pizzeria. A sign in front said it was voted best pizza by the Food Network. Not sure if that's true, but that's what it said.   I couldn't wait to try it out, so I ordered a pizza to take back to the hotel room. Boy, was I underwelmed. Not even close to the best pizza I ever had. I think I should stay open-minded about this and maybe visit another location. But at this point, it wouldn't even make my top twenty list. I do have to say the service was good. The bartender who took my order was very busy, but still took the time to walk back to the kitchen to check on my order."}
{"text":"Walking around ye ole town and being that's it's mt first time here, I was hard up to find a good meal being that ask the bars and restaurants are packed to the gills with spring training fever.  Behold I spot a coal fired oven pizza place that's a 4 star from the universal code breaker that is Yelp.  Packed bar.. not one seat open. But behold, thou art a lone deucer table. \"hi.. table for one please\".... the hostess, who was snipishly looking at me wirh her pair of cohorts on either side murmured.. \"the wait will be about....\"; then she thought twice and reassessed the situation and sat me right away at the deucer.  I have high hopes for my personal sausage & pepperoni..  Ok.... So being from the northeast, I have yet to find decent pizza west of the Mississippi.. and when I noticed the 4 star pizza place w/ reviews like \"best pizza in AZ\" I was hopeful to break the almighty pizza mold.. Nope nill negative. While it was tasty, west coast just doesn't compare to east coast pizza. I give the food a 7.25/10.  While the pizza was decent, the service was snippishly adequate. While the waitress apologized for giving me a small rather then a personal and apologized and adjusted the bill."}
{"text":"Last night was our first time ever trying Grimaldi's. We had to wait about 25mins since we had large party. After being seated we were thanked for waiting. The service was very well & the pizza was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly & funny he liked my sons red hair since his was red too. We will totally be coming back for more pizza & there salads were also good too"}
{"text":"This is the second grimaldis I've been to (the first was in NY) and I was just as happy with this one and the original! The pizza was bigger than expected and delicious! The waiters were good, although he came off as a little lazy since he refused to help us split the check since we had a huge party (15 people) but whatever we ended up using a $50 Amex giftcard that palazzo gave us and splitting the check evenly. Overall a good experience if you're staying in the palazzo or venetian! Viva Las Vegas :')"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza is the marguerite. So most of this review is geared toward that. The crust was good. The service was Good.  The salad was great. The pizza sauce ruined the entire pizza. It tasted like pasta sauce. Those who know this pizza know the sauce needs to be full of tomatoes and herbs. The sauce was gross. And no fresh tomatoes were on it."}
{"text":"The pizza here is so good!!!  Especially after drinking...  I ate 3 slices very quickly without chewing.  I tried the meat pizza (sausage, peperoni, etc) and the veggie pizza which had a ton of veggies and garlic on it.  Minutes later after I finished eating, I went to lay down on the bed at the hotel.  I started to develop a massive headache and felt really sick.  Next thing you know, my body couldn't hold the food down.  I didn't have food poisoning or anything, but just found out I cannot eat garlic ever again after being hungover.  The ride home to Cali from Vegas was so bad, I felt bad for my friends in the same car as me.  That's another story for the books..."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite pizza in Las Vegas, hands-down, despite the fact that it is a bit more expensive than I'd usually prefer for a pizza place.    Crispy thin crust, the sauce is flavourful but there's not too much of it -- no soggy pizza for me!  They have a wide array of toppings -- I usually go for ricotta which is to die for, fresh garlic, fresh sliced tomato and basil (the tomato and basil's best when it goes on after it's cooked).  Yes, their italian sausage, pepperoni, roasted peppers and sundried tomatoes are awesome but I like to keep it simple.  They've got a nice wine list -- whether you want something pricey or just the house red you'll be happy.  Also, if you're a fan of caesar salad, make sure you try theirs.  It's not dripping with dressing like you'll find at a lot of places!  The downsides... It's a small restaurant and can get very cramped so if you're coming with a big group, anyone with mobility issues or small children I would highly recommend not coming at peak dinner time.  Also, there is one waitress there who is just unpleasant.  All the rest of the staff are wonderful from the bartenders to the hostesses up to management... I don't know what her problem is but every single time I've been there she's made it clear that she does NOT want to be there.  But overall, all of the pluses make up for one bad apple in the bunch."}
{"text":"Great hospitality by the staff. Perla (host) was very nice attentive and polite. I went with my kids and she noticed they were a bit fuzzy. She brought over some dough for them to play and coloring paper with crayons. The server was very nice as well and the food was great."}
{"text":"Tried the Summerlin location.  Too expensive for pizza.   You have to pay for toppings.  Veggie toppings $4.00 and $3.00 for meat toppings. My husband I don't like the same toppings so we tried to order 1/2 on one side and 1/2 on other side.  They charge full price still for each topping even if only on 1/2 the pizza..  Pizza looked large but not filling due to the thin crust.  A small with two toppings will set you back $16.00 bucks.  Was shopping at Fashion Show mall with friends and they wanted to try this place.  4 calzone's and 4 sodas later set us back $91.00 without tip.  Ouch.  Could have gone upstairs to the food court and had the same items and payed 1/3 what we payed for this tasteless calzone."}
{"text":"OH GOD!  The Savior of Scottsdale!  After eating at several places in Scottsdale which were all below average in my opinion (but all had good yelp reviews, mind you), this place saved the day on my last day there.  Grimaldi's definitely came through with a delicious NY Style Thin crust.    We had a white pizza with garlic and added italian sausage, artichoke hearts and mushrooms and it was made to perfection.  The best pizza I've had in a long time!  This place is getting my 5 star seal of approval to help bump it up above the other places that had an overall 4 star rating and were crap!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food and fair prices. I was surprised that they have a location in El Segundo in California. Top quality ingredients and fast service. I would recommend to anyone hungry for pizza, salads and deserts."}
{"text":"Good food and service. We had the Brooklyn Bridge pizza and it was delicious! One note, don't order their bloody mary's, just go for beer and wine. The bloody mary's are from a mix and they don't even have Tobasco to spice it up!"}
{"text":"Love love love.. Their pizza is great.. Perfectly Thin crust.. Well made.. My whole family loves their pizza too.. Location is great inside boca park, very convenient. If the weather is nice, sit in the patio overlooking boca park.. If they reduce their price a little I would go much more often! :)"}
{"text":"I like this place. We went for dinner on a Saturday at 6pm (I have a hard time with the idea of dinner before 8, but I was tired and starving), and it was already full. However, we were offered a seat at the bar with no wait, so we took it. I was excited about the Peroni on tap. They have a small but great selection of tap beers, including Papago's Orange Cream. We got the traditional red sauce with Italian sausage and mushrooms, which was excellent."}
{"text":"Hosted a baby shower here, it was cozy and quaint as we were set up in a private room for a more intimate setting. It was perfect for all of us as we were separate and could have a conversation and celebrate. Our server was great, very attentive even tho we all were scurrying in and out at different times. I got the small spinach salad but nothing was small about it. It was great, comes with bacon, cheese, (lots of onions so keep that in mind if you don't like raw onions), and did I mention bacon! We also got a few pizzas, one being pepperoni and ricotta. It was also delicious and had just the right amount of pepperoni and ricotta in each bite. They pleased us and we are very happy we chose this location."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Ok service. I felt like I was in a nice restaurant that didn't have any servers. It took forever for someone to come to us so we could order. Once we did order, no one ever checked on us if we needed refills or anything else. The food was absolutely amazing; so good! The service was pretty blah. I would probably not go back to this location and try a different location for better service. The Don pizza is to die for! Excellent!!!"}
{"text":"This first experience has been fantastic. My brother received a FREE large one-topping pizza for his bday. Be sure to come at 4:45 for your pizza from a freshly stoked oven. Perfectly cooked with fresh mozzarella and delicious sauce. The Caesar and caprese salads were a great starter. We'll be returning for the great pie! Don't forget the tiramisu."}
{"text":"Very tasty if you like thin crust. We got the original cheese - the ingredients are very fresh. Going to try the original location in NYC this summer to compare :)"}
{"text":"Went to their location at the palazzo. The salads were amazing. I had the kale chopped and also tried the Caesar and house chopped salad from my friends. Very big portion for a small salad, can feed 2. The pizza was amazing. Great crust, smoky and delicious. The pepperoni they use is the old fashioned artisanal and elevates the pizza to new heights. We Will be back."}
{"text":"The Pizza was excellent: thin crust, coal or wood fired oven, fresh ingredients.  I wasn't expecting it to be great, but it was really good.  The atmosphere is nice too."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. Robin and other servers took great care of us. She allowed my son to sit at a table where he could see the oven and watch pizzas being made. She also gave him a small dough to play with.  The chief showed us how he practice dough making. Pizza and Kale salad were great. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Another great experience!!!!! Extremely loud kitchen today, but all good. Tarah took good care of us...."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's was one of our stops on the Old Town Scottsdale lunch food tour.  They served us a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza and both were very tasty.  The crust is thin with good flavor.  Really fresh cheese.  Service was really good.  Since we were on the tour we didn't pay so not sure what the prices are like.  Quite a few people in the restaurant when we were there and everything looked good.  They actually have a restaurant in Denver (didn't know!) on 16th Street Mall, so will have to check it out."}
{"text":"Great salad, the pizza was just okay for me. The service was excellent though."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab pizza in Vegas! The atmosphere is great, the service is amazing and the pizza is to die for. The pizza is crispy and is always baked fresh! The pizza's are definitely big enough to share."}
{"text":"I decided to dine here for my birthday dinner. I don't like crowds  so I typically dine at restaurants on off peak hours. However, when we arrived they were stoking their ovens. I then called to place pick up order and was told it would be 7:15 even though the ovens were done at 5:15. And was also told that i had to understand other people in the restaurant and other to go orders. I guess my trip to this location is not as valuable as others considering we were already turned away."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have trouble deciding where we want pizza from when picking between this place and Settebello! Honestly if it was just about pizza I'd say Settebello has the edge , but it's not a huge edge!!  As for Grimaldi's, here's how I see it:  Pros: *Cool vibe with a nice patio! Feels much more fun to dine here than Settebello. *Various sizes of pizza! I have issues at Settebello because the only size they serve is just a tad too big for me.... then I overeat because I can't leave the last piece on my plate etc...or then I waste some... I prefer to order a slighly larger pie at Grimaldi's and split it! Much more cost effective and no wasted pizza and overeating. *better drink menu *They spread the cheese out! No huge globs of cheese.. the yummy cheese is spread out perfectly.  Cons: *Crust is slightly better at Settebello's *Ummm salame... can't find that here! In general I think toppings are a little better over at Settebello, but not by much.   Honestly we alternate between the two places depending on our mood. They are both awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre pizza w disappointing service. Our booth seats had leftover food bits from the las seating and glasses were quite dirty. Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"Welcome to Las Vegas, the land that time forgot or would like to. You're gonna need a breather from the progressive Hold'em tables, or flingin' quarters at the pole dancers, and you'll need to break bread somewhere. Why not break pizza dough?   As you know pizza opinions are highly subjective. Ask 20 people, \"Where's the best pie?\" and you will get 22 different answers. In Vegas maybe 35 answers.   This gilded pazzo palace of pizza in the Palazzo may be your answer. It's a perfect place to unstrap your 3 belly packs, both fanny packs, your selfie stick, bandolero of iPhones and garage door openers, your Blue Teeth, your own teeth and enjoy a house made pizza as big as a roulette wheel.   The Vibe: Its red checkered table cloths and a coal fired oven in a meager attempt to add some charm to a town that's charm lite. Who goes there? Anyone who's rapidly disposed of their disposable income at the Black Jack Tables before cocktail time.   The Staff: I want what our server took before his shift to make him so energetic and bubbly as Champagne. He was a cross between a UNLV Cheerleader and a long haul trucker takin' West Coast Turnarounds. You know the guy that makes coffee nervous? Our guy made that guy nervous. However, he was as good natured as a Lab Puppy and twice as friendly.   The Bar Program: Traditional B & W. A few drafts and a few wines and a full  bar if that's required. The house pushes the house Meritage. Mille Gradi (Sangiovese, Syrah, and Merlot. (Ask for the S and M at your own risk). Grimaldi's makes this stuff in Italy at least until there is a Trump tariff on it. Some said it was one click from salad dressing, some said it was was blended with sour dough starter, but for me it went down and stayed there. It is a very reasonable $35 per bottle and actually fine for your pizza.   The Chow: The Bruschetta Trio was a MEH-rinated Mushroom and Roasted Red Pepper version, next, a Jarred Artichoke with Olive Medley (courtesy of Kirkland), and finally, a classic sleepy Tomato and Basil (both out of season).   The Grimaldi's House Salad was everything that didn't get tossed onto a Garden Pizza the night before with a simple vinaigrette. Order this so you can look your internist in the eye and say you had something green with your Death Row meal.   The Caesar Salad on the other hand was manageable. The Romaine was fresh and not refreshed. The dressing was decent, but the croutons were only suitable as a bar nibble in a sleazoid Strip Club pandering to Army recruits.   The Pizza is what you came for, right? Order a few 23 inchers. What you order in Vegas may go home with you.   The Don (a meat lovers) was the pick of the litter. A crisp outer crust that drops off sharply as you close in on the center. It came with the troika of Meatballs, Pepperoni, and Sausage, house made Tomato Sauce, Mozzarell, and Parm from the green can. (God forgive them). Seeing as you have to call Uber to take you from your room to the reception desk in this hotel complex, it is convenient. Is it Mozza? No suh! Pizza Bianca? Nein, danke. But this pizza was the best of the bunch offered here.      Then there was the MEH-garita Pizza. This was Restaurant Supply Cheese on a cracker. Even though it was as big as an XL Whoopie Cushion, there weren't a whole lota whoopie with this one. Grab the waiter when he flies by and ask for three orders of Bacon and try it again.   The Pesto Special Order was scrambled. They pushed everything off the counter onto the next crust on the assembly line, fired it and delivered it. It was not what was requested, but we flexed and accepted it as is. The Pesto was more paste, oh, how can you muck that up? It's mindlessly easy to make. The Chewing Gum Chicken on top of it will give you something to do for hours. The rest of the mess was recycled Bruschetta. Forgettable.   In the end, Grimaldi's was a split decision between Grim and Aldi."}
{"text":"The food is usually very good. The hostesses lately have been very rude and our last visit may have been enough to not return. We had a pair of exchanges while waiting for a table that had our party discussing leaving after 26 minutes (when we were \"quoted 30-40 minutes\") and after 45 minutes (when the hostesses refused to answer how long into the wait we were).  After being seated our server flatly refused to put an order in of cheese on top of bread, which included us asking if they could just take cheese and put it on the bread before they warm the bread and her saying, \"we don't have cheese.\"  Other sparkles of the attentive service received are the expeditor trying to hand a hot plate to a toddler, getting our order wrong and failing with refills.   While the service is not typically this bad the rudeness from the hostesses is typical.  Such a shame because the food is usually so good."}
{"text":"I was more impressed with the restaurant itself rather than the pizza. This would be a great little place to have a romantic night out or dinner with a group friends. I love how creative they got with the decor in this place :D The service was more than exceptional.   As for the pizza, I think it was pretty decent quality, the pizza I ate this particular night was thin crust, sausage, and ricotta cheese. It was \"A-Ok\"- I wasn't jumping up and down about it but it wasn't bad at all. I didn't like how cold it got in a matter of minutes though. I also tried the red sangria- which was also just \"A-OK\" I've had better.   I will definitely give this place another try sometime and my hope is to get something around 5 star value! :D"}
{"text":"I reserved the semi private dining area for about 30 people for my daughter's high school graduation. Thank you Manager Mike Devine for making this a memorable experience. Mike was easy to work with and gave me good suggestions We had two servers in the room that were both wonderful. They kept our drinks filled and were at our tables constantly making sure everything was perfect the pizzas were great the salads were great and everybody had a great time thanks not only to the food but also to the service.  I would definitely go back and  also recommend to anyone  when needing a place for a  larger party"}
{"text":"My initial experience with Grimaldi's in Brooklyn was better but that was due to what I ordered not and not anything I can hold Grimaldi's accountable for.  I tried the Brooklyn Bridge pizza but was not a fan of the ricotta cheese.  Definitely is an acquired taste and will not order again.  I love the texture and crust of the pizza but the tartness of the ricotta cheese dulled the flavor of the italian sausage.  That being said the salad was loaded with delicious veggies and the dressing was light and flavorful.  The staff and servers were very accommodating and polite."}
{"text":"Let's just say this is \"not what it could be.\" The ambiance is nice, and the basic concept of a simple menu is refreshing, but it just felt sort of average. Also, for a restaurant that brags to have hot ovens, meaning it shouldn't take longer than 5 minutes to cook at the most, it took them 15 minutes to bring me my pizza. It also was sort of average pizza. This wasn't Neopolitan style, it wasn't deep dish or New York, it was just sort of basic. It certainly didn't feel fresh. Admittedly I think Neopolitan pizza is the best kind of pizza, and this just fell short for me."}
{"text":"Exceptional pizza, wth crust that's thinner than traditional NY style pizza.  The only thing that precludes me from giving them five stars is their corkage fee; it's not that it's too high, they simply refuse to allow you to bring in your own wine - you've got to buy theirs"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's was an excellent experience.  We took a large group of us (about 12 people) down for a team dinner and were quickly seated at our reserved table.  The impeccable service, good pizza and overall ambiance were very \"pizza shop\".  The overall location is not over the top, however it really exceeded expectations and the pizza was"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town. Love the history of Grimaldi's too... I visit about every six-months.  The upscale atmosphere is appropriate for a date night. They have a nice bar in front to keep you busy until your table is ready. The pizza is perfection with the coal-fired taste making it extra special. The cheese, sauce, and dough is all top notch! The salads are also well done.  Great place to bring out-of-towners who love pizza and want to check out old town."}
{"text":"I personally don't get the hype associated with this place. It's not as good as everyone makes it. I have tried to like this place, as I've visited three times hoping to join the others, but every time they have failed to impress. I love a good sauce, and this sauce is bland, no real flavor. I love pizza, especially wood fired, but Grimaldis is truly nothing but a trendy over hyped pizza joint."}
{"text":"Hubby & I LOVE LOVE LOVE this pizza hands down!  All day long!  It's our favorite pizza place!  We always take friends/relatives who's never been here.  (Any Grimaldi's in Vegas).  After dining, they all become fans, they  it too!  Always good/speedy service, nice atmosphere, friendly servers.  Our favorite is the thin crust pepperoni, sausage & mushroom pizza- delish!  We love the salad too, it's always fresh & super cold!  Also, if u  sign up for their email, they will give u a free large pizza  on our bday"}
{"text":"walked over there for dinner saturday night and they were closed!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza in phoenix. The pesto is the way to go. It is always busy and always worth the wait. Moving here from Chicago I was afraid I'd never find good pizza again. While I prefer deep dish, this is the best thin crust I have ever eaten. Dig in...and get the Peroni on draft its tasty."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA IN LAS VEGAS! I love how it's so authentic. Every single bite is enjoyable. Their salads are good and pretty simple. I usually order for take-out so I can pig out while watching Grey's Anatomy :) But it's also a great place to go for a casual date or family dinner. Affordable prices and friendly people. Can't go wrong at Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Yum. Thin, crispy crust - pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, onion, well done extra cheese. The best thing I have popped into this piehole in a while. Visited twice during our recent stay in Scottsdale, arriving around 5PM each time. Immediately sat, great service from Dallas, our waiter. Tried the house salad (ok, I didn't care for the roasted red peppers on it, kinda plain otherwise). But we tried the spinach the next time and even Mr. Muscle loved it. An 18\" pie is around $16 and then you add most ingredients at $2 a pop. So our average pie was $24 with leftovers for later. Pizza is solid, delicious. Nothing is overwhelming, this pie tends to be subtle on different levels. Not loaded down with ingredients (read kinda thin on pepperoni and sausage), frankly, I don't think the crust could stand up to it. But each bite is wonderful when its piping hot. Gotta love a place that just sells pizza - don't walk in here thinking there is any pasta!"}
{"text":"I am a fan!  My dearest and I went last night - he is borderline diabetic so doesn't eat pizza very often.  But, he had a need for za so we went to Grimaldi's.  We had been there once before many year ago with a larger party but this was just the two of us.  Red and white checkered tablecloths - I looked around for LADY or a TRAMP but none in sight.  We got there early and were lucky to score a high top table as the place was filled otherwise.  Our waitress was so good.  Personable, knowledgeable about the menu and much more importantly, friendly.    I ordered the house pinot  for $4.00.  WOW.  Generous pour and a really nice pinot.  OK so my dearest went with a Miller Lite.............  There are three basic choices for the pizza.   Regular, tomato based sauce (sure it was San Marzano's), white sauce and pesto.  We opted for the regular with meatball, onion, mushroom and green pepper on half for you know who!  Not me!  The atmosphere is fun - lively, kids doing their thing, and a great patio!  We waited awhile for our pizza but it was fun just date talking and people watching.   Several of the people around us ordered one of their salads.  They looked wonderful and the small one easily feeds 3 if not 4.    When our pizza came it was delicioso!  I am such a fan.  They only serve beer and wine but what's not to like with an excellent pino grig at $4 and Miller Lite ( oh yes they did have many other more palatable options).    I am looking forward to going back!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza. Pepperoni mushroom and sausage!! Yummmm. Our server Britt was so good and helpful. Loved this place. We will be back."}
{"text":"The waitress was exceedingly rude to my son and his boyfriend. At first I thought it might have been because she was having to stay late because of us coming in, but she was very nice to me and the other customers I watched her attend to. She just threw the pizza on the table and didn't say anything and then snatched the check faster than anyone I've ever seen. I also kept looking over and noticing her glaring at the two and giving them dirty looks. This is completely unprofessional. I came for pizza, not homophobic waitresses. Also the pizza was burnt."}
{"text":"I was here with two friends on a Thursday around 5 pm. Plenty of open seats then but filled in pretty full by the time we left. Our server, Hohn, was friendly and punctual without being overbearing and the manager filtered around to tables and was also friendly. The pizza was good and the personal size is plenty large enough for one and the \"small\" would likely be fine for two people.  A decent selection of draft beers though not an extensive non-pizza menu but he pizza is probably why you want to come here anyway.  I'd definitely come back if I'm in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"I like NY style pizza and this was tops. Real mozzarella and sauce. I heard they opened one in Katy. I may have to make a trip to the burbs."}
{"text":"This Pizza is one of the BEST I ever had. Extremely tasty. Very Italian. Owner told me they even make there own fresh mozz cheese. Good Service & Nice Atmosphere. Definitely going back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"You can get a variety of great pizza in Vegas but this place has got to be one of them! It's located in the Palazzo near all the fancy shops. The restaurant itself lives up the standard of fancy Vegas. We were seated on the outside front of the restaurant. We got The Don, which had italian sausage on it. We also got a veggie pizza (forgot the name). What really stood out was the thin crust and amazing cheese. I could just taste the quality of the cheese. Love it when you bite into it and it stretches out until it breaks...mmmmm. The crust was thin but not soggy created the perfect base for our pizza.  We had leftovers and ate it on the car ride back to LA....it was still delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is tasty just disappointed that i paid for extra cheese and there wasnt even enough cheese to cover all the sauce. It was very sparse. Would order again just dont want to have to spend an extra $4 for a normal amount of cheese."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Henderson.  It gets a little pricey when you want to add additional toppings to your pizza, but it's usually worth it (especially the meatballs).  Always sprinkle on some garlic powder and oregano to add the essential flavors and you're all set.  And you get a free pizza on your birthday!  Thanks again, Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Had my reveal here this evening and Shelly was our waitress. There were 28 of us and she was awesome! Never became overwhelmed, was always on top of it and it was just her.  Would completely recommend having a larger group here. We started with Mediterranean salads and Caesars.  Shortly after we finished the salads, the pizzas came out. All pizzas were exactly the way I ordered them. Everything was delicious.  Definitely have another family party here. Thank you Shelly so much!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great as is the service. Only complaint is that the charge for extra toppings is too high. They charge the same amount for extra toppings no matter the size you get or if you only want the topping on one half of the pizza. Oreo cheesecake is great."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza in town.They always have great service and the pizza is consistantly amazing..been going here for 5 years!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious! Without question the best \"New York\" style pizza joint in AZ, IMO. They accommodate orders, especially if you want one half different than the other. Cheesecake desserts are awesome. Oreo cheesecake is my favorite. The only reason I didn't rate a 5 is because when I went in a while ago at around 2-3pm, they told me they wouldn't be ready for another 1-2 hours due to cleaning the oven."}
{"text":"Great pizza! We always have enjoyed sitting at the bar more than the tables, specifically the little 4 seater bar outside the front. That way, if a fashion show starts while you are eating, you get to watch the whole thing from a great vantage point!   This place is perfect for a mid-shopping lunch / beer stop."}
{"text":"This place has really great pizza and the service is top notch.  I really do not eat pizza much anymore because most pizza places, the pizza is too greasy and too doughy.  The only pizza I really like anymore are the wood fired oven thin crust pizza.  Unfortunately the only places that makes it like that are usually high end Italian restaurants, but then it becomes an event.    Grimaldi's is the best of both worlds, they have excellent coal fired thin crust pizza and do not overload it with toppings that makes it all greasy.  It also feels like an old fashion pizza joint, where I feel I can go in for a quick bite to eat.  The service was excellent and they even brought out some pizza dough for my daughter to play with.  She really had a ball with the pizza dough, which really made my day."}
{"text":"I've heard about Grimaldi's in NY, so was surprised that they had locations in LV. Meatball Pizza with Ricotta and garlic...really awesome. Great crust, I loved it. I did take it to go but we devoured the pizza before hitting the town. The guy behind the bar was really cool too, talking about the pizza and filters and the other location, etc.   Definitely get more next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"So we tried the Monday $10 cheese special. Should have saved the $10 and had anything else to eat. I know this is supposed to be thin brick oven NY style, but if I wanted to eat chewy burnt cardboard I would have. The pizza was so burnt and chewy our teeth and mouth were sore after a few pieces. There was hardly any sauce on the crust. The mozzarella pieces were so rubbery they peeled right off. You needed a knife to cut it since it hurt our teeth to chew it. We live around the corner, and the pizza was lukewarm once it got home. We eat a lot of cheese pizza throughout this town, and this was definitely one of the worse. So many other options around town that I would skip this one. Incredibly disappointed to say the least.  The pizza didn't fill anyone up, and ended up making snacks afterwards."}
{"text":"Ordered the large  pesto with pepperoni and onions.  Very well may have been the best pizza i have ever eaten.  Was busy in there but pizza only took like 8 mins to get served. Big wine selection altho the carafe was barely enough for two."}
{"text":"Grimalid's is a great place for pizza! My office dines here every so often, and it's always a great experience. Normally one of the gals sets a reservation since when we go, there's normally ~10 of us, so we're put in one of the private rooms close to the bar. That makes it much more enjoyable so we can chat and not worry about being loud around others [since I've accepted that reality about us]. Our arrival times are a bit spread out, and when I have arrived there is a waiter right behind me, ready to take my drink order.   The appetizers are amazing. Definitely go for the Caprese and Antipasto - everything appears & tastes fresh! I normally do not eat tomatoes, but theirs with the mozzarella & balsamic is tasty. It's a great tongue teaser for their pizzas. I love love love thin crust, and Grimaldi's hits it out of the park! Slices are a little big, but so worth the calories. Favorites? Always the classic pepperoni, meatball, or veggie. Our group normally orders a few different varieties."}
{"text":"Dear GOD!!  Best pizza ever!    Great wine. Acceptable service. (Little slow, but nice). We had the antipasto which was really good and just had pepperoni pizza (they charge about $2 per topping. Only downside). Let me just say that as simple as a one topping pizza is, it was exemplary!  Downside: entrance too small to stand. Crowded. Upside: got us in fast. Downside: waitress took too long for everything!"}
{"text":"For a place that wasn't half full, it took around 5 minutes to get seated. The pizza was mediocre; not the best we've had from other grimaldis. They were in a hurry to get our orders, but pizza took about 45 minutes. Didn't check on us until half hour later... Our glasses have been empty for awhile. Overall... Not that great."}
{"text":"Brick oven deliciousness! The pizza at Grimaldis is not just large in size it is also full of flavor...and always wanting more. Thin crust Delicious dough and sauce is authentic so full of gourmet flavor... and I love they use fresh motzzarella...the toppings are also far from skimpy. A+ for authenticity and originality with a very common product. I am always craving their pizza.   The restaurant is cozy and romantic, they have a full bar and TV to keep up with the sports/news, nice brick and classy dining.   Highly recommended if you want a thin crust, brick oven authentic pizza, little taste of Italy...mmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor that is chic and at the same time very welcoming. Gorgeous pizza and wine. And great taste and thoughtfulness displayed by the staff. Definitely a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"Came in on super bowl sunday, there was a mistake w/ the order and Jose and his staff offered to fix the situation. When I think most pizza places would rather pass along the error to the customer, Jose offered a quick fix during one of the busiest times of the year.  I'm from out of state, but I'll always remember their customer services, if/when I come back, I'll certainly return my business here."}
{"text":"Vacationing here in Vegas. I just have to say Grimaldi's has the best thin crust pizza ever. We ordered a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The crust was crunchy and the pizza was cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best cheese pizza I've ever had in my life. Decent caesar salad and tiramisu."}
{"text":"There isn't much to be said about this particular location except that I really liked it. I stopped by here at around 5 pm on a Sunday and ordered a cheese pizza with mushrooms, basil and anchovies (not my ideal toppings but I went along with it). The pizza turned out to be delicious; the ambience was great and it wasn't too noisy.   I don't care what anyone says, Grimaldi pizza is great!"}
{"text":"The service is good but the food is not great. The pizza was soggy and had very little toppings, looked and tasted like cheese pizza. We requested that they should add more toppings, so they added little bit more topping on the existing pizza which ended up tasting terrible!! The manager spoke to us and advised us that we should have ordered double topping. A large pizza and with three toppings cost $22  to $25 (the food is not cheap)  There are so many good pizza restaurants in the valley who serve tasty pizza's and do not skimp on toppings.  I have no plans to visit this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"Items Selected: Large Pizza - Half Traditional / Half White with Garlic and Artichoke Hearts Dessert Trio - Sampler of Cannoli, Tiramisu, Bailey's Irish Cream Cheesecake  Vowing to use every free offering and comp sent to me for my Birthday it was finally on Saturday that I decided to venture into Grimaldi's Coal Oven Pizzeria at The Palazzo, and sporting a coupon that affords one free Large Pizza with one topping (up to $18) it was only after a bizarre incident at the front desk that I found seating in the restaurant's main room, a request specifically made in order to watch the pizza makers at work without being exposed to the two-tops dotting the shopping mall's faux-patio.  Having more than once been steered away from the Brooklyn Bridge original by New Yorkers whose palates I trust, it was just after 3:00 that I arrived at Grimaldi's front stand and first refusing a seat at the bar, then basically having to demand to not be seated out front despite the restaurant only being 1/8 full, it was at a small table of my choosing that I finally relaxed, a young woman named Angie who preferred to call me \"buddy\" throughout the stay providing obligatory service, though often letting me see the bottom of my water glass.  Undoubtedly pegging me a tourist, and likely also put-off by the coupon which must be presented prior to placing an order, suffice it to say that my small table was low-priority compared to those drinking wine and ordering appetizers around me, but amused enough bby action in the kitchen and Martin, Sinatra, etc soundtrack above it really wasn't too much a bother, the fifteen minute prep-time for my pie whizzing past and the resultant cracker-crisp disk landing before me with cheese still bubbling and crust lightly charred.  Obviously not the artisan pies offered by Neapolitan spots in town, but at the same time using quality ingredients including whole milk Mozzarella and their own signature sauces brought in direct from New York it should come as no surprise that the coal-oven crust is where Grimaldi's makes its mark, and with good blister, great chew, and just enough thickness to hold up to toppings without being sloppy the flavor profile of both halves was good, if not great - the red sauce trending a bit too sweet for my palate while the white was nicely tinged with garlic, the artichoke hearts a bit overpriced at $4 however, and in desperate need of salt or some marinade.  Boxing up two red slices, as well as two slices of white, and later donating them to a trio of guys with a sign indicating \"anything helps\" en route to Caesars', it seemed only fair to give desserts a try considering the complimentary pie, and with the fresh-piped cannoli far out-showing the soggy slop served at celebrated Carlo's Bakery just a few steps away it is unfortunate that neither the cocoa-heavy tiramisu or overly-sweetened cheesecake could ascend to such heights, the $10 trio a good enough deal for scaled down portions, though if left to do it again I'd simply invest the $4.50 in the plate of two-cannolis, and save the rest for somewhere else.  Better than many local purveyors of the \"New York Slice,\" and served up in splashy environs that clearly cost the restaurant high rent, there are simply far better places for pizza in Sin City than Grimaldi's - several even under the same roof."}
{"text":"Legitimate NYC pizza.    Even the workers have a Brooklyn accent, AND they flip their pizzas in front of you...Old school.    Ordered a large white pie with artichoke hearts, pepperoni, ricotta cheese and mushrooms.  Freakin amazing.  Everything from the crust to the toppings was delicious.    Had their seasonal blueberry cobbler cheesecake, best cheesecake I have EVER had in my life, which is a tie for first with Harriet's in Los Angeles.  Cheesecake factory needs to step it up if you ask me.    Will definitely be frequenting this spot."}
{"text":"Where's the sauce. All you hear about is Grimaldi's famous suuuace. But when the pizza comes there isn't any.  Not great for kids and its a fricken pizza joint. Server could care less. Worth the trip...no way. Go get pizza at the place in the promenade at the quad. It's far superior."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a handful of times and have nothing short of excellence pizza . Be sure to sign up for their birthday program to get a free pizza every year."}
{"text":"Me and my husband pass by this restaurant all the time when we visit the palazzo. We finally got to try a small pizza with ricotta cheese, mushroom, and Italian sausage. The thin crust was crunchy but you can still taste the dough. Sauce was not greasy and salty, it makes the pizza a little watery but overall was great. You can really taste the flavor of the pizza. If you want to relax and stay in your room. Just call and order for take out like we did :), you will enjoy it for sure."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite pizza I have had in Arizona. The big chunks of cheese and the perfectly sized and seasoned pepperoni have such an amazing flavor on the thin crust pizza. We get the large pizza and have plenty to eat for lunch the next day. The menu is reasonably priced.  I went overseas for a month and this was the first place I ate when I returned home.  The staff is always warm and welcoming. They usually have a sports game on the tv's which is a bonus for my husband. If you sign up for their email club, they send you a certificate for a free large cheese pizza for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Taste's like authentic NY pizza with that crispy yummy crust.  Loved the fresh mozzarella.  I've never had a pizza with that type of Mozz.  We got the large pie with pepperoni, garlic and mushrooms.  It was delicious!  Had some the next day and it was still very tasty.  A great place to eat pizza in vegas."}
{"text":"I must say, this location is the best I have been too. We walked in when they were cleaning the ovens so we had to wait about 15 min to eat but it was worth it. We had a couple of coupons and the server honored both when he could have done just 1. Our drinks were always full and the food and cheesecake were great."}
{"text":"This was a great dining experience! My girlfriend got a small BBQ chicken pizza and I had a calzone. The food was great and our waiter was very attentive. We mentioned we were new to the area and he was able to go above and beyond as far as recommending places to check out, where to rent, etc. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The pizza style reminds me of my recent trip to Copenhagen, Denmark. Freshly prepared and cooked to deliciousness. We tried the popular The Brooklyn Bridge and The Don. Great choices! The large (consisting of eight slices  = $25). Great pizza and our server Ashley was very attentive and knowledgeable. Will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the pizza and walked it back to my room. It took about 20 minutes for the pizza to be ready which was quick considering how busy it was. The prices were fair for Vegas food, but the red sauce wasn't as hearty as I like it. However I am not a big fan of New York style pizza.   The next time I am in Vegas I will have to try it in the restaurant and update my review."}
{"text":"I am giving Grimaldi's Pizzeria a 4 just because I had one not-so-tiny bad experience there, otherwise, it would get 5 stars from me. First time trying it was over a year ago and it was delicious. I would come back all the time and referred quite a few customers there. I still go about once a week, or every other week. My first bad experience was several weeks ago when I ordered a sliced tomato and mushroom pizza. I was enjoying and was half way finished when I took a bite in something very chewy. It was pepperoni. Now this wouldn't be a big deal at all if eating meat was not against my beliefs. It really surprised me because I had been there so many times and this one time, out of all the pizzas, and all the people who do eat meat, this happens to me. Weird. I complained and the manager came out to apologize and that was it. She just apologized and stood there. It took her a few minutes to offer not charging us for the pizza. It was very awkward. Other that that one bad experience, I still come back. Always. The quality of the pizza sauce is GREAT and everything else is great as well. This pizza is made in the brick oven so it will not be your usual pizza you order from Dominos or Pizza Hut. If you are used to thick, greasy, nasty, low quality pizza, this place is NOT for you."}
{"text":"Chicken ceaser salad to start, a small shares enough for two. Medium thin crust pizza just the way you want it! Half chicken and pesto, half pepperoni... with a bottle of Riesling to boot!   Great place for a casual date. Great jazz tunes while you watch your pie dough being tossed and slid into the brick oven. Well, unless you are sitting on the patio! Tables are not too close to one another so it's a great space for sliding your chair back to relax and leave some intimacy for a date.  Staff checks in on your table throughout your visit just enough to not be annoying or leave you low on wine!   Thanks Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"Years ago my wife drove with her friend from San Diego just to eat Grimaldi's Pizza. Afterwards they drove directly back to San Diego. We are going here for dinner tonight and can't wait!"}
{"text":"Good flavor, good service, long wait and under done pepperonis. Gotta go to Grimaldis in Brooklyn to compare the two. Nothing special."}
{"text":"My first time here. Also my last. Food was mediocre at best. Toppings on My daughter's pizza (she ordered ham) was pretty much nonexistent.  When we asked about it the server sent over the manager.   The GM came over to see \"what the problem was\" ...he was a condescending jerk!  He said to us \"there's no reason to stress\". [We weren't stressing]. He told us we were wrong and there was enough ham on the pizza (basically one small square per slice). He LAUGHED at me & belittled me when I told him \"I know a little about pizza- I work for a pizza place\". He was a complete ass. Then walked over to the hostess stand and whispered & laughed.   Horrible experience.  #grimaldis"}
{"text":"Date of restaurant visit: 03/21/2014  Grimaldi's is one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area.  I always hook up with my Scottsdale friends when I'm in town and we like to eat there.  The pizza crust is thin and crispy, the way I like it.  We usually get 2 or 3 large pizzas and a house salad.  The classic pizza with red sauce, mozzarella and basil is $16.  You can add any type of topping for an extra price.  For example, Italian sausage is $2.  The food is always very good.  The service staff is excellent.  If you go at prime time for dinner, expect a 20-30 minute wait."}
{"text":"I had learned about Grimaldi's on some food tv or travel channel show. Figuring I may never get to NYC and having learned that they have locations in Vegas I decided my next trip to Vegas I would come here.   The pizza here is pretty awesome. I love thin crust pizza and Grimaldi's does it well. I can imagine that the pizza at the original location in Brooklyn must be incredible. So why the 4 stars?? well, I still think the pizza at Village Pizzaria in Larchmont Village in Los Angeles does it better. But by no means is there anything wrong with the pizza here. By far this is probably the best pizza in Vegas. And the service was great. Got a really sweet and cute waitress who made me feel welcome."}
{"text":"I must of passed this place dozens of time on eastern in Henderson without any thought of going in. Then I heard their history of coal burning in New York so I had to try it. My brother and I went there for a large pie and cold drafts, also the person who told me the history. The place was busy at 5:30 pm they keep the menu simple to order we ordered a large with half jalapeño and pepperoni, I love the crust and the sauce too. It was delicious and had that traditional NY coal oven taste, I'm from New York but now a local, so yes I was impressed and heard they have a place in the fashion square mall a mile from my house! So when in the mall I won't just pass it by anymore I'll stop in for sure"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. You have to get \"The Don\" from this place (sub spicy chicken sausage), it is to die for. My wife got the gluten free pesto, add grilled chicken...you could not tell it was any different. If I ever get pizza again in this city....I'm coming here."}
{"text":"We had the Grimaldis house salad, bruschetta and large sausage pizza. Tastes just like real NY street pizza from places like Ray's in the city. Sauce and crust make the pie."}
{"text":"Rude staff, no split topping and no ranch. The owners may be from New York but their store is in the west. Get with the times!!!"}
{"text":"Craving a delicious artisan pizza, and bummed to discover that Bianco's is closed on Sundays, we were determined to track down the next best thing. My boyfriend's brother, ball player a.k.a. the king of twitter, does what he knows best and asks his 80,000 followers where to eat. After more than enough responses, Grimaldi's is the clear winner, especially after I make him throw in the \"gourmet, wood-fire\", etc words.  Honestly, some of the best pizza I've had in my life if not EVER. Amazing, thin, bubbly crust is topped with whatever you please and cooked to perfection in a brick-coal oven. We went with the whole family and Grimaldi's managed to wow all of us which is hard to do with such a diversely opinionated bunch as ours. My favorite was the one I picked out of course: a tomato sauce pie with pepperoni, mushroom, artichoke hearts, and ricotta. So good, I will be racing to go back there next time I'm in Scottsdale, I can't wait!"}
{"text":"We had a lg pesto pizza with grilled chicken and artichoke hearts for 35.   - FANTASTIC service! I was amazed with the waiter's knowledge about the pizza. Being a first timer, Ken introduced us the way of Grimaldis. Attentative to every detail, he explained how their pizza is different and also gave good recommendations. I didn't even have to ask for a refill.  - Pizza was delightful. The water is the difference! lol. Right pH makes the dough crispy and light. Served hot and fresh to us, the waiter even placed the first slice on our plate. Fancy. - Toppings add up. $5 grilled chicken and $4 artichoke hearts. Hits hard for students. haha.  - Free magnets! 1/2 off wine on Tuesday."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate couple birthdays in the family and we had a large and demanding party with little children. We were promptly seated and well takes care of the entire time. Our waiter kept up with every little request and constantly made sure we were taken care of. The food was amazing and we finished every last bite! We enjoyed our night and received 5 star service!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite grimaldis. It's spacious, clean, and the manager really knows how to do business right. There's area in the front you can wait in, which you can't do very easily at the others. When the staff messed u and send our order to another table- the manager came right over, was super accommodating, and made us feel good about our dining experience. I will make the drive to return here again- in my opinion, it's worth it. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This place offer very high quality NY style pizza.  The crust is top notch with a good balance of crisp and chew.  The crust is somewhat thin and does not hold up to over topping the pie.  As a result I recommend keeping it simple.  Given the very high quality ingredients one does not need to overload the topping for a great pie."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pizza.  It's a thin crispy crust with the right amount of pull and chew.  Neopolitan-esque.  Not at all greasy with good ingredients.  It's thin so it doesn't hold up well to heavier toppings... so keep it simple.  Not place to go out of your way for... but good if you're in the neighborhood and looking for decent pie."}
{"text":"So, this is the spot if you're into authentic Italian pizza!  It was VERY tasty . . . you can really tell that it's fired in a brick oven!  I like the choice on toppings, although it can get pricey at a couple bucks each.  The size of the food is enormous!  I had an individual pizza and could only eat 2 pieces.  I also had a small caesar salad and it was most certainly enough for 2 to 3 people.  The waitstaff was on top of things, the bartender very kind and the hostess a little sweetheart.    Only 2 complaints . . . first off, NO drink specials at all.  Happy hour doesn't exist here but I guess it doesn't have to.  Secondly, if you like to dip your pie in ranch, this is not the place.  Wonderfully authentic food, but not so good for those like myself who like to soak crust in delicious creamy goodness.  You know, a truly good ranch is one of the reasons I love specific pizza places . . . sorry if that's \"white trash\" to those foodies out there.  All in all though, I liked this place and I'll definitely return when I want upscale pizza!  :-)"}
{"text":"Very small but yummy. Large party was accommodated very well. The menu was straighforward and I like that you create your own. I got a personal pizza which served two (12 inches). We got the white garlic pizza with ricotta, artichokes, and grilled chicken. I wish they had spinach. It was great though. Will probably be back if I need a pizza fix when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a must stop and eat place if you are in Vegas. They have the best pizza I have ever had. Make sure to get ricotta cheese on your pizza. You can thank me later. if you saved room for dessert, make sure to get a cannoli. The filling is the sweet nectar from the gods that you have heard about."}
{"text":"Great pizza: just like NY pizza.  Best pizza in Las Vegas.  best spinach salad I've ever had at a restaurant.  Great service. Tom is a great waiter and Mark's a great manager.  And great value. Especially for the strip.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great margarita pizza! Nice place to grab lunch with a big group. Tastes very similar to the famous lombardis in NYC."}
{"text":"Been here many times however food quality has declined over past few months. Was looking forward to dinner here but got seriously disappointed. Caesar salad was just plain, and pizza gets cold too fast. Asked for extra cheese and got less...told the manager who merely tried to explain their process and that there really was extra cheese and quickly ran off saying that we wouldn't be charged for the extra cheese. Didn't even try to listen to feedback, and was an unpleasant dining experience. Definitely not worth spending over $30 to dine out...money better spent on fast food pizza. Diane was a very personable and great server but the poor food quality is not there anymore.  Wouldn't even return for a free pizza."}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST pizza ever!!! you must get it with ricotta. If you've never had pizza with ricotta on it, it sounds strange...but It is life changing! Every time we have family or friends come in to town we take them, and they fall in love too!! This review is making me hungry for their bomb pizza!!"}
{"text":"My family loves Grimaldi's pizza. Mostly we just get one pie with cheese and another with pepperoni and sausage. I try to keep the number of toppings to a minimum to prevent the crust from taking on moisture and ruining the experience.  I haven't been to this location in quite some time, but I remember it being above average with respect to food and service quality. During this visit, that memory was confirmed. The crust on both pizzas were almost cracker-like in its crispness, and the toppings tasted very fresh. The manager came by to check on us and make sure everything was to our liking.  My wife said the diet Pepsi tasted like bug spray, but that's pretty much how I think it tastes anyway, so... they must have gotten it right ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to several Grimaldi's Pizzarias around Phoenix and I think they're pretty consistent. Consistently good, that is.   The parking at this location is a little more of a challenge than the others since it is right in downtown Scottsdale, but it is very convenient if you're already in downtown and walking around.   As with the other locations, there is a little bar up front and a main dining area behind that with a view of the pizza oven (okay, it is more like the \"view\" that will bump up your apartment or hotel rate, but you can see the people making the pizzas)  We were seated almost immediately, which I would expect for 3:45pm on a weekday -- our eating schedule had gotten messed up due to travel, which benefitted us here: no wait! We were greeted by Cassandra and our drink order was taken and filled quickly, despite what seemed like a skeleton crew and a fairly full dining room. We placed our pizza order after deciding that we would order extra so that we could have leftovers for lunch the next day and then relaxed while the order was prepared. During that time, the sodas were kept full and we had a side order of bread (skipping breakfast AND lunch... and then running 12 miles can leave you pretty hungry!)  The first pizza arrived a few minutes before the second one (yah, we were ALL hungry!) and we dug into it immediately. Perfectly hot and fresh -- it was topped with red sauce and cheese. If you haven't been here before, I highly recommend starting with that since the minimal toppings allow the crust to crisp up nicely. Our second pie had sausage and pepperoni on it and was likewise very tasty.  Tip: Ask for some oregano and garlic powder if you like those things. They can enhance your experience if you like a little extra flavor.  The check was delivered and processed quickly and efficiently, and I am looking forward to eating leftovers today for lunch. We had 4 people (2 adults and 2 kids), ordered a large and a small pizza and have about 1/2 pizza leftover for today."}
{"text":"== BEGIN UPDATE Have you ever been to a pizza place where they bring the hot pizza out and apologize, saying it didn't come out as large as they had hoped... *so they are making you another one* ?  I have. The large pizza we ordered here on our last visit was *maybe* just a bit smaller than normal, so they brought us *another* small pizza to make up for it. Wow! I don't even know what to say except that someone in management is ON IT. Thank you Grimaldi's! In addition to fantastic pizza, the service here is amazing. They are still deserving of my 5 stars! == END UPDATE  Our family enjoys Grimaldi's pizza. We are fans of the thin, crispy crust. I am someone who loves a bunch of \"stuff\" on my pizza, but I always recommend that you keep the toppings to a minimum here. Any extra toppings contribute extra moisture that makes the crust less crisp. Sure, it cooks up nice, but by the time it gets to your table, it just won't be the same if it has a bunch of meats and veggies piled on top.    Speaking of which, \"to go\"?  No way!  Put that crispy crust in a box and it steams away to sogginess. Just don't do it. Note that the charge for toppings is the same regardless of whether you want them on the whole pizza or half, so try and control yourself. Better yet, just get sauce and cheese for your first visit. :)  The sauce is nice and flavorful, although some of us like to add a bit of oregano.  The Caesar salad is good -- and a small will feed 2-3 people easily as a starter, maybe even 4."}
{"text":"heard so many great things about this place.  had to try. after the 1st taste I was hooked and we've been coming here ever since.  we love the meatball, with fresh garlic and ricotta.  house made.  it's creamy with a hint of sweetness, it's like no other.  sometimes the crust gets a little darker than I like in spots, but that's the magic of their brick oven.  the crisp, on the outside, chewy on the inside, amazing for such a thin crust.   can't compare it to settebellos, 2 totally different pizzas.  both amazing.    2 cons: pricey and long waits.     good thing the pizza is so darn good."}
{"text":"I have been going here for about 3 years regularly. I have never once had an bad experience. The the staff is amazing, friendly and responsive. The management at this particular Grimaldis drives epic levels of quality, integrity and outstanding hospitality I haven't seen elsewhere. The pizza is GREAT, fresh ingredients, amazing sauce and a wide array of toppings.   The salad here is the eighth wonder of the world. Salad easily in my mind can not be perfect consistency,  so I can forgive an occasional bit of brown or wilt.  This NEVER happens here and I eat here like three times a week. The salad is SO FRESH!!! I am grateful this place exists."}
{"text":"I admit that my rating miiiiight be inflated because we ate here after a loooong day in Sedona and a rather big hike and I was ravenous!  My parents love this place, and I will never say no to pizza. I love that it is thin crust. Love. And they have a really nice selection of kinds of pizza. You can get a normal red sauce pizza, a pesto based pizza and a white pizza. Pesto and white styles?! You really ARE speaking my pizza language! Luckily we are a sharing type of group. Because my sister wanted a pesto base, my boyfriend wanted a white pizza, and I wanted both! The table ordered three pizzas total, and they came out pretty quickly considering the place was also fairly busy! We ordered what we did, thinking we would bring leftovers back to the hotel with us....but suddenly....ALL the pizza was gone and in our bellies. Like, almost immediately. So much for leftovers! Ha! We did order some desserts to bring back with us. I got the tiramisu, and it was delicious. Yum!  Service was...fine. We had to remind our server about our to-go desserts when she returned with our paid bill and wished us a good evening. They did come after that. Overall service got the job done, nothing to write home about.  I like thin crust pizza and I like tiramisu. I liked my visit here. You won't be missing out terribly if you don't go here, but you won't regret going here if you want so pizza!"}
{"text":"Came here on Valentines with a group of 5. I'm from Orange County, California and found this place on Yelp. In my opinion the mouth water pictures on Yelp do the food justice. The pizza is delicious. We ordered 2 large pizza, antipasto, and 4 desserts. I do wish that they had pizzas already put together instead of 100% having to build them. It makes a supreme quite pricey, but still good. Where they are loosing 1 star for me is really the service of the managers. We were served one pizza and 20 minutes later, after the first one was done the second one came out even though they were ordered at the same time. The manager brought the clearly burnt pizza to us. He explained that it was burnt and offered to make us a new one, he was very polite. We declined and said it was fine, we would just eat it that way as we had already waited and didnt want to wait any longer. After a few sentences back and forth and him being more than apologetic, he told us he would, \"figure something out.\" We all took it as give us some kinda discount. Five minutes later another manager is hanging out around our table clearly looking at our food, but didn't say a word. When we all looked at him he said \"looks perfect to me.\" We all just looked at each other mystified. When the bill came nothing was taken off or discounted. Don't say you're going to do something and not! That was quiet annoying, but we will still be back. The waitress was pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night for a beer before watching Jurassic World on opening night. The place was pretty empty considering they were getting ready to close. We decided to come back and try pizza in the near future because it smelled so good. The server was chill, got us our beers, and wasn't pesty. I enjoyed the ambiance, and what appeared to be glass bottle lighting. The bathrooms were also clean."}
{"text":"we have gone twice recently. average wait about 15 min. food was awesome and we had good service both times. will go back soon."}
{"text":"I'm going to preface this review by saying that I'm from Chicago and am very particular about pizza as a whole.  I went here for a family function.  Didn't get to see the inside of the restaurant, as we were all seated out in the breezeway.  Servers were very nice and tolerant of our party of 25 or so.    My wife and I got a 1/2 carafe of red sangria- it was okay for the price (probably not worth $14 in retrospect).  We got an individual cheeze pizza and a small Caesar salad to split between us- it was a good portion for us.  Other people got \"small\" pizzas, and they were pretty big.  The pizza itself was really, really good.  Thin crust, crispy crust, light ricotta-style cheese on top.  More towards the flatbread end of the pizza spectrum, but it was very, very good pizza.  I'd definitely eat here again.  A little on the pricey side, but not terrible."}
{"text":"Awesome New York style pizza. Service was good. That's pretty much all I have to say! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hot fresh quick and very nice to just sit outside, drink a little wine and relax at the en of the day. Good wine selection. Plenty of topping options. Can't beat a brick oven pizza."}
{"text":"This place was a great choice. The pizza was amazing and piping hot. They have a really good beer and wine selection. We can't wait to try this place again."}
{"text":"The pizza is great here, my family and I have been here more times than I can count but tonight we walked out because of the terrible service.  We were promptly seated and the place was not really busy with plenty of staff.  We waited more than 10 minutes without anyone coming to our table, really disappointed because we love this place."}
{"text":"We shared a large pepperoni, and it was SO good.  Thin style crust, amazing mozzarella, tangy sauce, slight taste of basil. Perfect ratio of everything.  Cute place inside too.  Such good pizza!"}
{"text":"For those who have spent time in CA like me their thin crust NY is very similar to Amicis, and that's a good thing.  It has that style and that level of quality, at a reduced price.  The personal is $9 plus toppings which is a deal in comparison.  Service was some of the best I've encountered, even in cities where service is king like Vegas and Orlando. Its not truly a unique NY pizza joint but I can see that conisistency and quality will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I had a  birthday coupon for a free large pizza which is certainly a very wonderful and generous birthday offering from the fine folks at Grimaldi's Pizza!  So, a big thank you to them for a very nice treat!  The free pizza came with one topping, and I chose the basic pepperoni topping.    The restaurant is located in Boca Park which is an upscale shopping area with  various stores and restaurants.  The lot filled up fast on a weekend with nice weather, so it may not always be easy to find a parking spot. This area is quite popular!    There's a very pretty fountain in the front with outdoor patio seating which is great during nice weather.  The interior is somewhat dimly lit, but that's actually relaxing on hot Vegas days.  The decor is well designed  and there's tables along with  a few booths tucked here and there.    The pizza is thin crust,  I tend to be more of a thick crust person, however, their thin crust was nicely executed, with just enough crunch but not tough or chewy.  I expected it to have a bit more oven/smokey/coal baked flavor, so that was a little disappointing, although not a huge drawback. The sauce was okay - every now and then, the sauce tasted somewhat like meat sauce that you'd put  on spaghetti rather than typical  pizza sauce, but nevertheless was good.  As some people have pointed out, the cheese has a habit of coming off with the bite rather than sticking to the crust.  Again, not a huge drawback, just a tad annoying.  Let's put it this way:  I've had better pizza and I've also had a lot worse, so Grimaldi's certainly provides a pizza that's worth checking out.  I also ordered one of their in-house cannolli.  As seems to be the case with cannolli, most of it isn't very memorable, with a filling that didn't stand out with any particular flavor.  It contains mini chocolate chips which are tasty, and that's mainly what you taste with this cannolli.  I won't hold that against them, though, because as I say, most cannolli for some reason seems to be run of the mill.  My recommendation  would be to  try a different dessert,  such as  one of their seasonal cheesecakes or their tiramisu.   They also serve wine and beer, although I didn't try any of those offerings.  Service was outstanding, professional, friendly and helpful.  FIVE STAR on that!    I was very  happy to have had the opportunity to try this Grimaldi's and if/when I make the trek  here for a second try, I would be more adventurous with the pizza toppings, as per some of the suggestions of other posters.  Bottom line:  if you're looking for a visually pleasing, nicely upscale area to have a pizza located in Boca Park  with friends and family, this spot would certainly be one to consider and check out!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large mushroom pizza over the phone.  Order taker repeated it back.  20 minutes to pick up.  I arrived to a completely full parking lot, some would say is a good sign. At the end of the bar is where you pick up the take out orders.  I received prompt attention and noticed the pizza in the box was a small.  The bartender offered to throw in a drink to make it up, or make a new pizza.  I let it go, the small was big enough.  Got it home. Wow! a crispy, cracker-like crust.  Slices of excellent mozzarella left no greasy pools.  The tomato sauce was properly applied.  A bit extra basil made this a terrific mushroom pizza.  I will go here again, for sure.  Probably for lunch, when I hope it won't be so crowded."}
{"text":"This pizza is great. Went in for a carry out order they where so friendly can't wait to go back so I can stay and have a meal inside."}
{"text":"Coal brick oven pizza!!  Supposedly that's one of the best ways to bake pizza.  And Grimaldi's punch line is \"the pizza that made the Brooklyn Bridge famous\".  Anyways, this place was recommended by one of the managers working at the Venetian.  It HAD to be good.  So they have personal, medium, and large; we opted for the large at ($18).  You select your toppings starting at ($2) each; we chose the fresh garlic and Italian sausage.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#STZXp7K9wnVPNTo4mWOYFw This is probably one of the few times I've had NY style crust, and WHOA it tastes so delicious, especially when it's hot and the handmade (!) mozzarella is so melty, creamy, and cheesy.  There were nice, soft tomato chunks in the pizza sauce.    I'd recommend trying their salads, we ordered the large Caesar salad ($9) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#x8UalMguK50OYQZmSPWA4A to munch on while the pizza was baking.  I don't know how they make salads so good, because the lettuce was cut into SMALL bite-sized pieces, dewy but not too wet, and the caesar dressing was perfectly spicy and peppery.  Topped with fresh parmesan cheese... YEAH A VERY GOOD SALAD.    The decor is beautiful in here.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?userid=4MHFQcFfHzVe4ISx3lvHlw#nKsnllmo62-w6zwkqh4Jow Bottomless wine bottles with tiny lights in them are configured in a chandelier arrangement on the ceiling.  Their \"patio\" area opens into the mall area, and sort of in a corner location so I'd recommend sitting in the regular dining area (which is more beautiful).  But the patio does open right into the bar area.  Quick, attentive service.  No problem at all."}
{"text":"Oh happy accident! I was tired and resigned to eating another Greek salad when my band of weary travelers wanted pizza near our hotel.  As I looked at the menu I discovered they had gluten-free, which is typically a pre made frozen crust.  Not at Grimaldi's!  It was the best pizza I've ever eaten (pesto, mozzarella, spinach, onions, and bacon) So good, the wheat eaters in my group tried it and suddenly-no leftovers for me   I just hope the one in my home state is as good"}
{"text":"Food was delicious,  the wait, not so much. And you need more patio heaters to seat people outside,  that's an easy fix. A little annoyed that  I paid more in toppings than I did for one of the pizzas. Normally that would be ok I guess, but there the should be a decent amount of those toppings. And a charge for extra sauce, really?  I just asked how the sauce was, because I like it a bit more saucy. I get up-sells but you gotta be more upfront about these things.   Lots of good pizza out there for less. May or not not try it again."}
{"text":"We loveeee Grimaldi's !! I am gluten free and they have delicious gluten free crust. The service is always on point.   We also had the Mediterranean salad and its huge! Definitely enough for a family of 4 to share.   Don't forget the cannoli's ... Some of my fave I've had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Scottsdale, it's actually really good you should try it at least once. Order it for pickup"}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza and a large calzone. The calzone was enormous. The crust on the pizza was pretty awesome but everything else, including the calzone was only ok. Definitely not bad but nothing to really get excited about either. The young lady who took the order and greeted us was very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust pizza, but man the mileu is not the same.  It is not NYC unfortunately.     But it was a very very great treat to have when you are not in NYC.  Wished they built a place like this in the bay area."}
{"text":"Since moving to vegas last year my wife and I have found this place. If you like new york style pizza you will love this place. So good. Seriously. I swear they have crack in their sauce, it's addicting.  Last time we went my wife got the kale salad, dang good. We like the straight pepperoni the best. Margherita was decent. Canollis are amazing, just not big enough."}
{"text":"5+++++ stars!  Went here tonight because we received a coupon from them for hubby's birthday - a free large pizza with one topping.    The pizza was amazing, as always.  The sauce is so flavorful and delicious.  I even love it as it starts getting cold - it really \"pops\" when it's cold and I'm not a cold pizza kinda gal.  We ordered the NY style cheesecake for dessert (see photo) and our waiter, Alec, told us that our bill was taken care of.  We weren't sure we heard him right - I mean, we had a coupon for free pizza but we did get iced teas and cheesecake.  We thought that was SO nice!    Terrific service and incredible pizza, as always.  It just keeps getting better and better!"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza here, as always.  The sauce and cheese are so fresh and delicious!  And the service is always friendly and professional.  I honestly could eat Grimaldi's multiple times a week and never get tired of it!  This particular location was very slow on a weekday afternoon for lunch.  We waited a pretty long time for our large regular pie.    Also, the parking situation was a NIGHTMARE.  Seriously, my husband spent half his lunch break looking for a spot.  I've never seen such a craptastic parking lot.     If you sign up for Grimaldi's club thing, you'll get a $5 coupon emailed to you and a coupon for a free large pie on your birthday.  One of the best rewards programs for a restaurant that I know of.  I'll use my birthday coupon at a different location, though, because this place is way too much of a headache at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Service at this location is as top notch as the others!  We always get friendly and attentive servers and, last night, the manager came over to ask us how everything was.  That was a nice touch.   The pizza here is as fresh and delicious as the other Grimaldi's locations I've been to.  The sauce and fresh cheese is such a delight.    I love this location because you can look out onto the Encore and Wynn and, at nighttime, it's a really beautiful sight.  I just love those tall buildings with their sparkly signs!  The wine bottle chandeliers are really cool, too.  The restaurant is very clean and decor is simple and inspiring for a NY'er with touches of NY all around (subway signs, photos of NY landmarks - Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty, Coney Island, etc).    This is such a taste of home but with a more \"upscale\" feel than some of the other locations.    Deliciousness and pure fulfillment, as always."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. The Scottsdale Quarter location has fantastic service- very personable!  Really enjoy their pizza. Our family gets the cheese with meatball and the white garlic. Big fan of the thin crust pizza.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ate a lot of pizza during my recent trip to Vegas...I had Secret pizza, Lasagna pizza, and then on my last day I grabbed some Grimaldi's pizza.  I love pizza, whether it be chicago style or new york style. I ordered a large garlic chicken pizza from here right before I left Vegas.  Like typical NY style, its thin and crispy. It tasted very fresh and you can tell its not just any other place. I liked it a lot. You can choose traditnal style (red sauce), white sauce, and pesto.   For sure a place to check out for some good old NY style pizza!"}
{"text":"A great place to have an oven-baked, thin crust pizza! A very simple and straight-forward menu presents you with basic sauces and sizes and then you can pile on the ingredients as you wish. A large pizza withe 2-3 toppings will run you about $20 and it is worth it.  I normally enjoy a large pizza with pesto sauce and add mushrooms and ham or bacon. The smokey flavor of the crust and the ham, married with the richness of the pesto make this pizza my favorite every time I visit. The staff is very friendly, but if you have the opportunity to be helped by Javier, he will make sure you are well taken care of-- he is AWESOME.  Lastly, make sure you sign up for their email club and receive a FREE PIZZA on your bday!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is yummy and just fan-fricken-tastic!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza only wish mine had a lil more cheese on it. Helpful Polite Staff. Nice selection of domestic micro brews."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  We like to go around 8pm or later on a Tuesday night because it is less noisy and a lot more relaxing when there are fewer people in the place.  Normally I would take advantage of an outdoor patio when the weather is nice however, the ambiance is amazing so we like to sit inside and enjoy our meal.   We ordered cheese with fresh Roma tomatoes,  kalamata olives, and fresh basil with the red sauce.  YUM!!  We love the thin crust and the sauce is amazing.  The service was outstanding and always is.  A must try for those of you that haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Good thin crust NY style pizza.  I ate the margarita pizza, cheese pizza, and meatball.  Meatball pizza was the best, but others were good too.  I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Pizza is super. You can order any way you want. My husband and I share a large with different toppings on both sides and the price is reasonable. We have left overs for the next day. Crust is great and the pizzas are always cooked just right. This can get crowded sometimes, so take-out is a good option. (And you can do that and sit in the nearby park to eat if desired.) Also, pizza can take a while, so we order quickly when we sit down. Menu is limited - don't go if your looking to get something other than pizza. Also, the drink menu is slim, but they have the basics (beer, wine and a few other things) available. 5-stars because the pizza is sooo good!"}
{"text":"They claim to have reverse engineered the Bronx water. It's been a while since I've been to NY, so can't compare it. It is very good pizza though. I remember NY pizza being floppy. The pizza here is super crispy with a bit of char from their oven. This adds a smokiness that I like on my pizza. We had the white pizza (if you love garlic or hate vampires, this is the one for you). We also had the pesto pizza, I liked this way more then I was expecting. I don't know if they offer this pesto in pasta, but I would imagine it would be awesome. We also ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza. I'm a fan of fennel, and their italian sausage has a distinct fennel flavor. The tomato sauce is sweet. Over all it's slightly salty... which by the way, it's the best pizza to match up with beer."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing as well as their Caesar salad and cheesecake. Also always have great service. I have eaten here a few times but I normally pick up the food to-go."}
{"text":"By far some of the best Pizza I've had with the perfect crust, amazing sauce and fresh toppings.  Me and my wife try to get here often.  Restaurant has the Italian pizzeria atmosphere with seating inside and outside.  Impressive wine selection and full bar.  My favorite Pizza is the pepperoni, sausage, tomatoes, and basil.  A true religious dining experience that leaves you anticipating your next visit!  Not too expensive and the atmosphere is very nice.  They're also next to this beautiful restaurant/shopping area with a number of restaurants and shops.  To top it off they have a wonderful walking park where you can walk after dinner complete with a covered bridge.  Would make a great romantic evening if you want to impress your date or significant other!"}
{"text":"Atomosphere, service, and food were awesome!  I was pleasantly surprised and sad I hadn't tried Grimaldis until now"}
{"text":"The pie was good but not as good as I remembered in ny, the sausage was delicious and the crust was pretty thin and chewy.  My husband said that it was disappointing because you can get it almost anywhere.  True it has become a chain like pizza place.  The Cesar salad was average nothing I would order again.  We will try those guys pies the next time."}
{"text":"Smelled pretty good she you walk in, we got the pepperoni sausage and jalapeño yummy for sure.  Also got the pepperoni and mush room.  I can not remember the one jn ny but it was pretty yummy yum yum if you like gun pizza"}
{"text":"Ok, so I seem to agree with everyone here from the 5 stars to the 1 star. The pizza is simply fantastic. I understand they use a filtering system for their water which explains the delightful crust. The mozzarella is top notch,  they use quality pepperoni and other meats.   Like some of the others here though, I have experienced downright shoddy service. The management is lackadaisical to the point where I took the time to write the corporate office. To be blunt \"he just doesn't give a damn\". That is too bad because the place is just screaming to be a success. I know that I have avoided this place, just based on the management alone. We have a wood fired pizza joint (Sal's Tuscan grill) nearby which has really good pizza as well and when I am peeved at Grimaldi's, I go there instead.  It isn't as  good as Grimaldi's but customer service counts for something. GET OVER YOURSELF and treat your customers with some respect."}
{"text":"Omg!!!  \"To die for\"   The \"BEST\" pizza we've ever had!  Toppings are a little expensive but it's well worth it.  The restaurant is small but very clean and the service is awesome.   Pizza comes out fast and hot and the taste is sooo amazingly good and fresh.  You have got to go try it you will not regret it."}
{"text":"In two trips thus far to Las Vegas, during which I can say I have not had a single bad meal, this place stands out as probably the best yet. Some of the best pizza I've had anywhere. The caprese is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Went there on my birthday Oct 27 with my wife and daughter and used my free large pizza birthday coupon.  I've been here several times and every time has been great.  I always get the pepperoni and sausage and sometimes we have red pepper on it.  Sometimes we get a salad which is always good, Greek or antipasto.   The location and ambience are great.  Nice looking authentic checkered table cloths with cherry wood thru out and u can view the pizza cooks in action."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Double pepperoni with a Mediterranean salad. Don't try to order ranch to dip it in they may give you attitude. They slice their own pepperoni which makes for different sizes and chunks. Make sure you sign up for their birthday club you will receive a free one topping pizza on your birthday! Waiters and waitresses are hit and miss! Any pizza other than pepperoni is no good so I don't venture out of my comfort zone"}
{"text":"Horrible service as soon as you walk in... no one is at reception....  chaos.... people are walking in and are being seated before us.... wtf???  Names and party size are not being taken....other staff see a waiting room full of people... but no one acknowledges us...very disappointed Grimaldi's.... used to be our favorite spot."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad. Got a birthday coupon for a large one topping pizza. Ordered a few beers and 2 salads on the side. Everything came out delicious and even had left overs. We were seated outside because they were full inside. Even with the heaters it was a bit cold. Other than that no complaints. Thanks"}
{"text":"I like the pizza, but am not in love with it. The thin crust is chewy and not cracker like, so that is a plus. The base pizzas are reasonable, but can be exorbitantly expensive with the addition of a few toppings. If you enjoy a basic pizza then Grimaldi's is fantastic choice. It is just difficult when they offer some amazing additional ingredients. The White Pizza with Garlic packs on the taste of garlic and that is always appreciated. Maybe not for the people I am with, but I am never too worried about them.  Working in the industry, I know that no server wants someone to come in and share a small pizza, but I was not hungry. I just came to keep my friend company and ended up snacking. Our waiter didn't seem too happy about this and focused more on other tables. It was fine, because he did refill my water once and that was enough to get me through the meal. Other than that, he was pleasant and prompt with getting what we needed.  The parking is always a mess in this complex. A Tuesday night and it was packed to capacity. There isn't any other parking options, so it will have to do."}
{"text":"A very good pizza sometimes comes at a price. After adding on all of their delicious toppings, the price can skyrocket. It does not devalue the appeal of Grimaldi's, but there are other great pizza joints that does not cost as much and produces a better pie.  I love the serious crunch of the crust. It is that couple of level before charred. The sometimes slight darkening on the edge is perfect. The toppings are generous for the price point. Every inch of the pie was covered in a bite of almost everything.   The service was perfect. Checked in to clear plates and see how we were doing without interrupting us."}
{"text":"I called on Monday to make a reservation for the following Sunday and was told they were booked. This is the third time I've attempted to make a reservation for a group and been denied service from them. I spoke to the manager Brian and he was rude and sarcastic. I made a complaint to the corporate website- no response. I have spoke to several people that have said they have had the same experience when trying to book a table for 10 or more people. One individual was told they do not want big parties as it \"Backs up service \" since they only have one oven. What a awful way to run a business. We will never attempt to go to your restaurant again. Unfortunately this was for my granddaughters birthday dinner so had to disappoint her. FYI: called last year for her birthday and got a reservation for 15 no problem!"}
{"text":"Ate here tonight, was sitting at the table next to another person who wrote a bad review.  The coals in their oven died out from over use, that's what happens when you are constantly moving pizzas in and out especially on a busy night.  The guys making the pizza's did a great job cranking out pies as fast as they could but you can only fit so many in the oven at 1 time.  The oven was not broken as another reviewer stated earlier.  She also stated that it took an hour for her two pizza's, funny, we ordered the same time as you, our pizza took 35 minutes and you received yours before we did.  I'm tired of people acting like it's the end of the world when your order takes a little longer than normal.  It's Friday night, the place is packed, you are there with friends and family, enjoy your time out together, or were you in a hurry to leave because your bratty son kept spilling his water and bumping into my wife's chair.  The server had informed us about the situation prior to our order just like she did to the other tables around us.  Pizza came out great as always and our server was very friendly and accommodating even when a 15 top of rowdy men were seated in her section.  For a corporate restaurant chain, the pizza is great.  1/2  carafe of wine and a large pizza our check was just over $30.  The location in DC ranch is beautiful, but you end up with snotty b!tches like the other reviewer tonight.  From what I recall she was in an 8 top with two children who couldn't stay in their seats, most of the time the entire party were on cell phones and nobody seemed to be conversing, I only saw 2 pizzas on your table along with 3 beers a salad and the rest glasses of water.  So as an 8 top, your check was probably around $60 which was  undoubtedly discounted after you made a scene complaining about how long it took.  I will definitely be back, the pizza is very good (much better than the Scottsdale quarter location), the staff is friendly, just sometimes the guests need to lighten up, if you wanted pizza in 30 minutes or less call dominoes."}
{"text":"Great pizza spot for late night eating, although it is off the beaten path past Canaletto's.  Unless you knew of this pizza joint you wouldn't venture to far away from the Casino area.  I have had their pizza in Brooklyn and surprisingly I liked the East Coast one better.  The traditional cheese pizza we had came with a burnt crust which was so hard you couldn't eat the ends and the garden salad was just okay.  Service was awesome and the waitress replenished out drinks frequently."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's, it's our go to pizza joint. We haven't been to this location in forever since they opened one up around the corner from our house but this was the first location in Vegas and the one that made me fall in love with their pizza. I still think this is the best Grimaldi's location in Vegas. It's small and the decor is casual but interesting. Staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I have been to Grimaldi's many, many, many times before and was so happy when this location opened, its right around the corner from home. We've been to the Summerlin location and they did a great job. We frequent the Eastern location and have never had a complaint, but the convenience of this location hits the spot. We got a large with extra cheese, meatball, and pepperoni...it was perfect. Service was great, I don't think many know about this location yet so it was pretty empty for a Saturday. The restaurant isn't as quaint as the Eastern location but there is alot more room to move. I think their gonna see our faces in their joint a lot."}
{"text":"I seriously don't see what pizza all these great reviews were eating. Very bland pizza and nothing like the Grimaldis in NY!"}
{"text":"We came here twice during our stay at the Palazzo and it did not disappoint. I love the crust and texture of the pizza. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Most over-hyped pizza in town.  Very crunchy, over-baked crust that was covered in black soot or some kind of crap that looked identical to black soot. Sauce that was too sweet and cheese that was M.I.A. Call me picky, but I like cheese on my pizza. Especially if I'm paying more than the price at any other pizza joint in town for it.  LGO pizza is far better. And it's also next door to the best effing gelato you'll ever have (Arlecchino).  Like my man Flavor Flave says--don't believe the hype.  Or, like I like to say--don't drink the kool-aid you effing moron."}
{"text":"Nice friendly service. Very tasty pizza. Thin crust full of flavor . Pepperoni pizza with a side of pesto, real good. Classic Cesar's salad was good tasty croutons. If your in Vegas you have to eat here!"}
{"text":"WONDERFUL!  Went for my birthday, the staff was great and very friendly.  The food AWSOME I joined their club and received a FREE pizza that was enough for the 4 of us.  The atmosphere was pleasant and great pictures of the Rat Pak.  We enjoyed ourselves, stop by when you are at the Palazzo."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and have never had a bad experience.  The pizza, while a bit pricey, never dissapoints. The salads are very tasty too."}
{"text":"My name is Tony, and I'm a Coalaholic.  Let me start by saying I grew up on Pizza Hut.  Not particularly by choice, but my mom worked there and irresponsibly (love ya mom!) brought home those lovely grease filled, cheese and meat covered circles of dough to my family nearly every other day.   Anytime I was hungry, Pizza Hut pizza was waiting for me in the fridge and I developed a dependency to my pan pizza friends.  Fast forward 20 something years and Pizza Hut was still my pie of choice over Dominos, Papa John's, etc.  I dug Metro Pizza, CPK, and others, but not until I had Grimaldi's did the wool finally get pulled from my eyes.  (begin food review)  OH THE CRUST!   I'd never had authentic NY pizza prior to Grimaldis (I'm sure there's some New Yorker reading this right now shaking their head due to their belief of what real NY Pizza is.   To them I say:  no one cares).   Once you go coal blackened, you never go back.   Every pizza I've had since has paled in comparison (here's looking at you Settebello).   I like every type of pizza you can get here.  The Regular with some Pepperoni is simple and delicious.  The White with Garlic and Anchovies.  The Pesto.  no, THE PESTO.  My absolute favorite.  Pesto with Pepperoni and Meatball with some jalapenos on the side.  Absolute perfection.   I typically eat the Eastern location which I find the most consistently good, though I did try the Fashion Show one a few nights ago and found it just as good on that one visit.  Ingredients tasted fresh, crust was that perfect nearly chewy texture.  Several calories were devoured that night.  One other shout out: the bartender that was working that night was fantastic.  I sat at the bar for about half an hour waiting for a friend and he made one of the best double jack and cokes I'd had in a while.  I had several throughout the night (note to reader: this may or may not have influenced my food review).   I dont remember his name, but the next time you're in the Fashion Show and need a buzz before you get lost in the 20 floors of Forever 21, swing by Grimaldis with $10.50."}
{"text":"Have been to the DC Ranch location a few times, and have had decent pizza, so after a little shopping at Kierland and in the Scottsdale Quarter, decided we felt like being bad and having some pizza.  *pm on a Saturday night and this place is still packed!  We get lucky and grab a bar table so we didn't have to wait 40 minutes.  We ordered a caesar salad, dressing is more of a vinaigrette style with a little lemon flavor and not creamy and sharp with parm and anchovy.  Pizza comes piping hot and cheesy with baby mini pepperonis and sausage.  Next time we will forgo the pepperoni as they were a bit on the greasy side.  ( as most are..) It's not as thin as a lavosh style pie, nor is it too bready like a NY style one, it's linda right in between.  The first couple bites need a fork and knife, and the rest can be eaten by hand (I fold lol) It's treasonably priced, and it's decent pizza.  The service is courteous, quick, and you are in and out pretty quickly.  The bar is open to the outside and there is a small outdoor patio as well.    There is a parking garage that has the quickest access on the East side of SQ it's the closest to Grimaldi's.  But really, it doesn't matter because it's a nice shopping center to walk around in, especially because there are way more shops open in it now."}
{"text":"We had seen the ad in The Palazzo that said this pizza had been voted best pizza by the Food Network a few years ago.  We decided to give it a try, OMG, it was a mouth watering experience!!  They are originally from Brooklyn and they make their own mozzarella, that is one of the best things about this pizza - top that with the best sauce and crust and making it in a coal brick oven - Grimaldi's has the best pizza either of us have ever had - HANDS DOWN!    We paired our pizza with a red blend wine.  We couldn't decide which one but I knew I wanted it to be from Italy to go with the whole Italiano theme.  We asked our server, Victor, he said both are good but his favorite was called \"Available\", one of the ones we had chosen...odd name but excellent choice!  He asked if we'd like to try both since we were ordering a bottle, he wanted us to try before we buy, what a nice option!    There was nothing about our pizza that could have made it any better than it was.  The mozzarella was a standout for me because I could tell it was fresh, the crust was thin and excellent and the sauce was so delicious.  Between the Italian ambiance, the pizza, the wine and our server, Victor, we both agreed that it was one of the best meals we have ever had in our 32 years together!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic pizza! The service is superb. I always enjoy myself every time I eat here."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Grimaldi's about 10 times, and the pizza is great every time!  The crust is crispy on the outside with just a bit of softness on the inside.  It is thin but not cracker-thin.  The coal oven giveS the pizza a nice smoky flavor.  The service is also friendly and expedient.    We have placed take-out orders a few times, and the order is always ready when they say it will be.  The employees are always courteous when taking my order on the phone.  The service is so good, I made sure to tell the manager the last time I was there.  He was also very gracious.  He makes the rounds every time I am there to talk to all the patrons.  I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"My husband begged me to come here so I finally agreed and I must say, it's pretty good. Maybe the top 5 pizza places I've been to. I hate that they don't have appetizers or many pizzas to choose from. It's a very simple menu with only pizza and salad."}
{"text":"Probably among the best thin crust I've ever had! n'uff said."}
{"text":"I lived In New York for 2 years and ate a ton of pizza and this was just as good.  I was skeptical at first but after eating pie with my buddies we were impressed.  I wanted to go another time before we left but ran out of time."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza someplace in the Venetian mall. The house salad is huge and filled with fresh vegetables and a tasty Italian dressing. The portions here are huge and two hungry people can easily split the small salad.  The pizza itself is the star, they use a coal fired oven which gives in a little bit of char and more crunch than many pizzas. The pizza has a sauce with a little bit of spice and doesn't need too much cheese. I had mushroom and black olives, the pizza was fresh, hot, and one of the best I've had. The 15 inch is plenty of food for two people. We had a salad and pizza and had about four slices left.   Service was very friendly and they did a good job giving this place the look and feel of a real NY pizzeria in the middle of a mall on the strip. This place is a must try for excellent pizza that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Pretty decent New York style pizza. In fact, possibly better than the \"original\" one in Brooklyn. Very relaxed dining atmosphere. Since we were recovering from the buffet earlier in the day, we opted for a margarita pizza and a large Mediterranean salad. They gave us two small Mediterranean salads instead, which I think was more than a large one.  Food was on point. Service was fast and friendly. Definitely wouldn't mind eating here again."}
{"text":"Came in on a hot night and grabbed a small pie with red sauce, pepperoni, sausage, sun-dried tomatoes, and mushrooms.  The thin crust was awesome and it was definitely a pretty big pizza for a small.  The only drawback is the price and the added extra cost for toppings ranging from $2-$5."}
{"text":"We ate at Grimaldi's three years ago and liked it so I was eager to return this past week when we were in Vegas again.  Unfortunately it was not as good as we remembered it and neither myself, my husband or my mother would return.  The pizza was just so-so, nothing special.  I love thin crust New York style pizza but the sauce was skimpy and overall, the pizza just didn't have enough flavor.  My husband is not very picky when it comes to pizza so I was surprised that he didn't like it either.  My mom got her own pizza and doesn't like a lot of sauce but commented that it appeared as though her pizza had no sauce.  Perhaps they were just having an \"off\" night as all restaurants do from time to time but we simply weren't impressed."}
{"text":"We arrived at Grimaldi's a little after 9:30pm (they're listed as open until 11pm).  Place was mostly empty, maybe 6-8 tables seated plus a patron or two at the bar.  We stood at the hostess stand for a couple minutes.  When the hostess? returned I asked for a table for 2.  She said it would be a few minutes.  That seemed odd... we were the only people waiting to be seated and there were many empty tables.  We gave her our name, anyway.  She walked away.  As we stood waiting we noticed the empty tables hadn't been cleared from the previous patrons, and it wasn't obvious anyone was bussing them.  Nonetheless, there were several employees basically standing around.  When the hostess didn't return in awhile, I started looking for her...  first she was taking pictures of a group at a table, then she was talking to another table, then she was talking to some other employees. But she was not clearing a table or, it appeared, trying to get someone else to clear a table.   We had been waiting for about 15-minutes at this point.  Eventually I caught her eye and she returned to the hostess stand and I asked what was taking so long.  She said she was sorry and offered us a table next to a loud boisterous group close to the hostess stand.  We asked for a table somewhere away from the noise. We were told it would be a few more minutes, and said she was sorry.  I again asked why this was taking so long, said she was sorry.  I said I noticed she had time to take pictures, she said they asked her to and she was sorry.  I said she had time to talk with others, she said she was sorry.  At that point I pretty sternly said \"stop saying you're sorry... sorry doesn't fix anything.\"  She said she was sorry.  We left and went to another restaurant where we waited about 5-minutes for a table which, coincidentally, it wasn't completely bussed... the hostess wiped it down, set it up and seated us.  Grimaldi's may/may not have excellent food... we'll never know since we won't be returning.  But they would do well to instill in their employees that being \"sorry\" doesn't fix a problem and it's never an excuse for poor service. Action fixes problems."}
{"text":"Average, if you ask me. I gave it a third try but it still fell flat. Their pizzas don't have much flavor at all. However, service and wine was decent."}
{"text":"I love this pizza! The flavor, the crust, the toppings, are all fresh and yummy. The Greek salad had such awesome flavor; my hubby actually loved it and he doesn't usually eat green food! Lol it was a bit pricey but I actually tried to buy all the items and make my own at home the other night and it was close to the same price for less food! Service is fabulous! Nya is our favorite. great at what she does, sweet, and fun. All around had a great time. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy Jesus, I have died and gone to heaven! This was the best pizza I have eaten outside of New York. We ordered the white pizza with pepperoni. Honestly, I could have eaten the large by myself, it was that good. Please, oh please, open one up in southern California!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldis is a nice pizza restaurant with amazing thin crust pizza. The pizza is thin, but not too thin where it's crunchy. They also have a variety of salads most standard. It's a very simple yet good menu. The New York cheesecake does not disappoint either. It's so rich and creamy and not overly sweet just perfect. The waitress was great also and made us feel right at home. Only reason for the 4 stars is it's very pricey. If you come here you will pay top dollar for these great pizzas. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"From what I understand, Grimaldi's is one of those New York pizza joints that's an insitution in the Big Apple, and a couple of those family members migrated to AZ and brought that kick-ass NY pizza with 'em. Even if that's not true, I don't care, because this is just really great pizza :)  The crust was thin and delicious. Our calzone was delightful. The antipasto plate was super. The service was great. ONLY issue is we got seated in the back area with all the large parties with screaming kids who kept running in and out of the back door we were seated next to...annoying beyond belief how parents let their brats run wild.   However, we'd be willing to come back. Every place deserves a second chance, and we'd come back just for the food. The other issue is easily rectified, and no doubt our next experience will be a 5-star one :)"}
{"text":"I've discovered that I am a FIEND for wood- or brick-fired oven pizza...just LOVE the thin, crispy, sometimes slighty charred crust that is created as a result of this process. And I have to credit my recent trip to Grimaldi's for this self revelation. Thank you!  We had a hankering for some pizza while on our trip to the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. Our aunt assured us that one of THE best places to nosh on some authentic, Brooklyn-based pizza was the original Grimaldi's location in DC Ranch (not the newer location).   Our hungry party of four arrived at Grimaldi's at 6:45pm on a lovely Saturday evening, and were informed it would be a half-hour wait, which to me was quite reasonable for a payday-weekend-Saturday night. After walking around DC Ranch for a bit to kill time, we got back and only had to wait about another 10 minutes (because we didn't want to sit at a high top table, which ended up being a bad call, but I'll get to that later), which was kinda torture because this place smells soooooo good and we were STARVING!  All told, the food was amazingly good with huge portions! Our small antipasto salad was great, as was our aunt/uncle's \"small\" mediterranean salad. The \"small\" pizza was delicious, as was the \"small\" calzone that Hubby and I split. I also enjoyed their passion fruit iced tea.  Two last things:  1. We got seated at a table in the back corner of the restaurant, which in itself wasn't bad, but it was right next to an exit door and very rude families with kids kept going in and out the damn door. Let's just say our aunt put a stop to that!  2. Our server Joe was excellent! Kept the drinks refilled and cleared the table in a very timely manner. He also commiserated with us having families with loud, uncontrolled kids being seated at the tables next to us. UGH!! That's where we should have taken that high-top table in the bar/adults only area at the front of the restaurant! Oh well, live and learn, right?!  I loved this place, and can't wait to go back and eat there when we visit our aunt/uncle again. :)"}
{"text":"This pizza is delicious. The service is good when I take it to go but not so good when we sat and ate there. The girl with the curly hair that sat us down was rude. I absolutely love their pepperoni."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place :) I always get the pepperoni pizza. Occasionally I will get the Greek salad or the antipasta :) Peroni is always a good addition to pizza, too.   The food is truly incredible. I could literally eat just the pepperoni. All of the ingredients are fresh.   Love the service and the atmosphere is amazing. Great entertainment for kids, too. You can watch the pizza guys spin dough in the air or can ask the server for a piece of dough to play with while waiting for the food :)   Great for family or for date night. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be silly, NY style pizza should be eaten as plain as possible for the 'experience', adding 10 different toppings won't make it taste better. We stopped by twice in our 4 days trip to try out all 3 basic flavors - white, white with garlic and pesto. They are all great, however, my favorite is probably white with garlic. If I were to add toppings, I think the choices would be extra basil on any of the three flavors or grilled chicken on garlic and that's it. Those would compliment the pies very well without overpowering.  Service was excellent.  Now, please open one in S.F. Bay Area."}
{"text":"If pizza, calzones or salad is what you are looking for, this is the place.  Thin crust that allows you to enjoy the cheese and toppings.  Personal salad could easily feed three if you are ordering a personal pizza along with it.  Sorry, we couldn't fit in dessert.  They do have a limited selection.  Staff was great, from the hostess, to the server, and anyone else who helped. .."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Took my Husband here for his Father's Day gift and I was so happy he enjoyed  the pizza. We ordered the pizza with the meatballs on it ( I forgot the name of it) and a small Strawberry spinach salad( had a lot of almonds tho, great if you're a fan of them). We definitely have a new pizza place just wish they sold bbq wings (hint hint)."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place of all time. The ricotta and pepperoni pizza NEVER disappoints. Even the times I've been here when they're really busy or service is maybe a little slow...I get my pizza and all is right with the world. Their Caesar salad is also always a good starter and their tiramisu or blueberry cheesecake (when in season) is the perfect ending. I can't say it enough....get ricotta and pepperoni on your pizza here. It's so sooo so good."}
{"text":"I am glad they opened this location - more convenient for us to get to when we are in town.  The pizza is really good and it's reasonably priced for the Strip.  We ordered a personal white pizza, half with sausage and mushroom and half with pepperoni and mushroom.  Such yummy greasy goodness!  Our server tried to get us to order their small sized pizza but we ended up going with the personal and it was more than enough for two people.  You get a total of four slices whether you get the personal or small; it's just that the slices are bigger if you get the small and of course more expensive.  They charge for each topping so it can get pretty costly depending on what you get.    We were pretty full from the pizza but we got cheesecake for dessert anyway :p  We were hoping to try their butterscotch toffee cheesecake but it wasn't available.  Instead, we got the peanut butter cup cheesecake which in my opinion wasn't anything to write home about.  Service was sloooow.  I believe it was just our server, but still, that aspect of our dinner could've been better.  I really enjoyed their pizza though and can't wait for the Palazzo location to open.  Will definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas :)  My go-to here is their personal white pizza with garlic, half with pepperoni and mushrooms and the other half with sausage and mushrooms.  The total comes out to $16.  Add a small Caesar salad ($7), and you've got quite a filling and decently-priced meal for two people.  On my last visit, three of us girls ordered a large pizza - it was too much food and we ended up with some leftovers.  The food here is very tasty, and service pretty good, but sometimes the crust is too burnt and the utensils/table not always the cleanest.  Hence, the four stars instead of five for Grimaldi's.  Still, it's one of my go-to spots in Vegas to grab a bite to eat and has been since it opened in the Shoppes at Palazzo."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza in chandler. Customer service is always # 1 hear , making sure everything is always good . We came in for lunch and was seated right away . The first pizza we ordered was a little over cooked , but they made another one and it was perfect . I will always go back . Thank you for the best customer service and great pizza."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place more but just can't give 4 stars...service was just ok.  Food was ok too...we ordered the chicken caesar salad and boy was it over dressed and salty! :( we also ordered the large garlic white with added pepperoni and mushrooms.  The pizza was def good but just wasn't a wow...bill was pretty steep for just pizza and salad (about $40 w/tip).  We wont be rushing back for more, but I'd go again if ever in the mood..."}
{"text":"Wow! We've eaten at the one on Eastern and almost used that experience to not try this location (on Rainbow). Glad we tried it because their service was awesome!!  Food was really good and better than the one on Eastern.  We had a large pepp/mushroom pizza and Caesars salad with chicken (light dressing).  Food was so good!!  I would def recommend this location! We will be back....the manager was so nice she checked in on us at least 3 times."}
{"text":"Fantastic thin crust pizzas with the best ingredients cooked in a coal fired oven. Service was friendly and efficient. Highly recommend this place. I kind of stuffed myself full of pizza slices- but hey I rarely get pizza so this was my treat and I won't be ashamed of myself f I break my scale tomorrow ah!"}
{"text":"This place was everything I was hoping it would be. I got the plain cheese pizza, because that's what you order to get a real feel for the taste of a pizza. It did not disappoint. The outside of the crust was nice and crispy, yet the inside remained delightfully chewy. Nicely seasoned sauce, had a slight sweetness to it. Absolutely phenomenal. Definitely lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"A good reminder of back home.  Pizza is pricey, but you get what you pay for and it is amazing."}
{"text":"Great thin crust brick oven pizza. We got a large house salad, a personal cheese pizza, and a large pizza with meatballs, Italian sausage, and artichoke hearts. Plenty of salad to go around. Hot pizza with fresh toppings.   Our party of 5 seated immediately at 7 on a Sunday night. Oven is in full view with pictures of many NYC landmarks on the wall. All food was served promptly without significant wait. But we were not given one refill throughout the entire meal. 4 out of 5 of us sat with empty glasses for about 20 minutes. We will continue to make our regular visits, just hope we don't crap out for the server again."}
{"text":"This place runs like a well oiled machine!  As soon as someone leaves, the table looks like a pit stop where everyone comes by cleans the table and set it up with the plates, napkins, and wine glasses.   As for the food.  There are no complaints, ordered a small white garlic crust pizza with meatballs and ricotta.  It was quick and delicious!  A must try!"}
{"text":"This was a memorable pizza, the best thin crust I've had.  I tend to lean more towards deep dish but I really liked this pizza."}
{"text":"The last several times we've had Grimaldi's we haven't been overly impressed with the pizza quality, lack of toppings, and the cost to value ratio just plain sucks. Last night we ordered 2 large 2 topping pizzas curb side for a measly $42.  After getting both pizzas home and opening the boxes we were presented with 2 pizzas that barely had enough mushrooms to even qualify as having them as a topping. Maybe if you combined the mushrooms from both of them you could've actually had enough for one. There was a decent amount of onions so no complaints there.  My wife and I can wolf down one of their pizzas with ease if that gives you any idea as to how filling they are, they aren't. The taste is good, the employees have always been friendly but the value is not there and in these times cost to value ratio matters a lot more than it used to."}
{"text":"This is the forth Grimaldi's that we have visited and the pizza is amazing. Be sure you give yourself the experience of eating one of their pies."}
{"text":"Some of the most amazing pizza I've ever had New York style cooking brick oven is incredible!    Be careful when ordering the small salad...It's enough for four"}
{"text":"We love Grimaldi's and look forward to it every time we are in AZ. It never disappoints."}
{"text":"First time here.This place is awesome!!! Cisco and Eric have great upbeat personal service. Fast service order came our perfect!!! They have great recommendations.. .see them you won't be let down."}
{"text":"Pretty good brick oven pizza. my boss and his wife go here every time they come to Arizona and brought me along this year(4/11). They accidentally burned one of the pizzas and it took quite some time before it came so they gave it to us no charge. thats good business. the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere is nice, though for some it might seem a little crowded.   definitely worth to check it out"}
{"text":"Just ok. Decent food and atmosphere. Staff could smile a little. The menu is VERY limited to salad and pizza only."}
{"text":"This place is broken. Were told there was a 30 min when we arrived. Waited 55 mins to be seated. Okay. Whatever. Sat down with my two sons who wanted pizza and were bravely enduring. Ordered immediately so we could get the pizza. Waitress told us it would take 45 minutes for our pizza. That's a long wait for pizza. But okay.  An hour and twenty minutes later we finally were served.    Offered to discount the pizza - not the point.   This is a pizza place. That's it. Period. Full stop. Taking orders for pizza and then bringing them to the table isn't one thing they do - it's their only thing.  Epic fail."}
{"text":"Great Pizza.  They filter their water in a way to make it taste like New York water.  This makes the pizza dough taste like pizza dough from Brooklyn.   Skip the anti pasto (olives are terribly salty and Salami is poor qualtiy)  and the caprese salad (tomatoes are nasty).  Focus on the Pizza"}
{"text":"I am extremely indecisive. Extremely when it comes to choosing a place to eat. So I left it up to my guy. He chose this place over Sushi. I wasn't in the mood for sushi so I played along. When I sat down and opened up the menu, it was extremely simple. I was shocked and almost got up and left. Why? Because I was craving more variety. My server came, she is from San Diego originally. She asked what we wanted to drink and I didn't want to waste her time. So I told her we may not eat here. I am still thinking. She gasped. Lol and said, \"Have you ever ate here before or had a Grimaldi's pizza?\" I was thinking... here we go, someone defending their place of work. What came out of her mouth I did not expect. She went to explain to me the dough is handmade and fresh daily. (Ok not impressive I thought) Then she went on to explain the importance of this place. She passionately told the story of how Grimaldi's hired a chemist to create a water system that makes exactly \"New York\" water. It's a $50,000 water system. She then went to explain the simplicity of the menu. It's authentic Italian pizzeria. She said they are so authentic down to their choices. She gave me her top three choices of salad. She sold me on her passion and knowledge of this place. I still didn't care for the simplicity of the menu... until I tasted my Mediterranean salad. YUM! It was simple. Full of flavor. I ordered the Garden pizza with sausage and pepperoni. (I love veggies) It was good. Our server asked us later how things tasted and I told her the truth about my pizza and I felt it was a little watery from the tomatoes. She didn't hesitate to say, \"Can I have them remake the pizza for you?\" I definitely declined because it was delicious just a little watery. But I knew why. Either way it was good. And there was no way I could have this remade. I was satisfied! I told her I would be doing desert. But gotten full and changed my mind. Due to my first time being there and my pizza not 100% (but 95%) to my liking... they comped me a cheesecake. TALK ABOUT INITIATIVE. Vince was the manager and he came out to greet us. I felt extremely special and I would like to thank the staff whom served us at Grimaldi's. As I will go back. What a warm wonderful place to bask in. All love tonight to a wonderful group of souls."}
{"text":"We showed up during a busy time and sat at the bar.  It looked like we had made mistake because the bartender was obviously more concerned with finishing his shift and getting out of there than greeting us.  Just as my wife and I were about to call it another female bartender showed up and saved the day.  She was very nice, helpful and though busy, she clearly understood how to keep everyone she was waiting on happy.  She had 4 or 5 tables on the patio and several guests at the bar.  She was also helping the wait staff with their drink orders.  They have a pretty good beer selection and best of all a very good wine selection.  We ordered a very nice bottle of wine that we had just had a few nights earlier at Fleming's and really enjoyed it.  The pizza was very good and we enjoyed an excellent salad as well.  Nice job!"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious freshly made pizzas.  They are very similar to the original Grimaldi's in the city.  They didn't seem to top the pizzas with EVOO as they do at their other establishments, but the pizza was still delicious"}
{"text":"FYI, I lived for PGP when I was studying at ACI in NYC. Cuz it's so YUM E! Couldn't believe when I lived at DCRanch, there was one right on Market Street. OK, so I haven't had the world famous, controversially long-lined, downtown Pizzeria Bianco yet. But, you know what? I don't think I need to. Cuz Patsy's my pizza passion. Thin crust, tangy sauce and simple and fresh toppings.The staff here is fantastic. Great bar to shoot a couple Patrons while waiting for your to go za. And to think you can get a meal at DCRanch for $15 and be drooling about the next day. Way cool!"}
{"text":"Every time  we come here they are soaking the oven and we can't order pizza. They told us it would over an hour and a half wait for pizza. Here's an idea - close after lunch and reopen for dinner when you can actually serve food."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good . My issue is that they are notoriously stingy when it comes to the toppings, I've asked the manager on numerous occasions to make sure every slice has the toppings and there are always a couple of slices with no toppings. Here is a slice with sausage, can you see any?"}
{"text":"Great food! Fast service! Keith JR. was one of the best servers I have ever had!! Eat here if you want a good time!!"}
{"text":"Pizza place, one thinks mmm good pizza, OK I love their salads! It was so yummie I want another one!  My girlfriend and I went here for a workday lunch. We shared a small salad which was plenty and a small pizza which was plenty.  Service was fast and friendly, we had leftovers, and the garlic on the pizza is no JOKE.  Think I had 3 pieces of gum after lunch.  I might've liked it better than Settebello, yep I said it."}
{"text":"I mean let's be honest IF you can put garlic on a pizza and no sauce and it's still damn good, you got something going for ya.  We went on our lunch break b/c I had to say hello to Mr. Kors.  We split a white pizza and split the salad and it was just right!  Service was fast and the food/drinks came right out. Bill was probably like $25 for the 2 of us."}
{"text":"The most delicious pizza I've ever tasted. And the place is kid friendly and the service is amazing. Definitely want to come back here again"}
{"text":"This place totally makes up for the other pizza place that unfortunately shares the same name as this place, but has absolutely no affiliation (thank goodness).  First off, I have to say that the two times I've been here, I haven't once paid for the actual pizza, because if you sign up your birthday, you're given a coupon by e-mail for a FREE PIZZA.  Extra toppings are extra charge, of course.  So  if you haven't tried this place yet and don't know whether you should spend your money, sign up to get a coupon on your birthday.  I'll definitely spend my money for a pizza even without a coupon.  The crust is thin and crispy, with just enough chew to it so it doesn't taste like a cracker with toppings.  The coal firing gives a wonderfully smokey flavor to the pizza, and leaves yummy bubbles in the crust.  So far we've done half pepperoni and half meatball.  Meatball you say?  I admit I've never had meatball on a pizza, so I couldn't help but picture golfball sized meatballs atop a thin slice harnessed in place with strings of mozzarella.  I know, I know..they Slice the meatballs, silly.  I'm normally not a big fan of pepperoni, but this stuff was surprizingly meaty, slightly spicey, and not too oily.  The meatballs though...the meatballs are my favorite.    Top everything off with great service (people that actually know their stuff), a fully stocked bar (with beer sporting the name of \"the Kilt Lifter\"), and nice cozy atmosphere.  I have been back, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza.  High quality, fresh ingredients.  Great value for the price."}
{"text":"This place is laughable, and I don't mean in a good way. This is the second trying I've tried to get pizza there but they shut their ovens down daily for an hour and a half or so and I seem to get them every time the ovens are shut down. I had called ahead of time to make sure I was in the window and they told me I wouldn't make it there in time to order so I tried to order a pizza ahead of time so it would be ready when I got there. They said they could only do that if I ordered it to go but I wanted to sit down in the restaurant and have a beer. They said that was not allowed.  Then she offered to put a manager on and I accepted. I waited on hold for a few minutes and finally had to hang up as I was driving. As far as I know, no manager came on and she just did that to get rid of me."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Grimaldi's pizza,  wow!    the pizza is excellent, crispy crust and genuine mozzarella cheese and sauce is tasty not salty.   We sat in the bar and it was a pretty relaxed atmosphere, and the bar is decorated in BK (Brooklyn subway signs),    The martini's are all new york themed, I had the Coney Island martini which consist of three olives cherry and chocolate vodka, chocolate liqueur, grenadine, dash of cream, and served in chocolate swirled glass.  Strong and sweet, kinda expensive @ $10.00 bucks, but since I am a light weight two of those would have made me tipsy, I only had one."}
{"text":"I'm originally from New York and honestly this pizza reminds me of home slices are cracker thin great flavor in the sauce  you can tell everything is very fresh been here plenty of times and the pizza only gets better and better"}
{"text":"$33 for a 16\" inch pizza that we did a half and half (they charge for EACH topping they consider \"extra\" on the second half), sorry but this is just plain wrong. If each pizza is $24 and you do a \"split\" the. what justifies up-charging $9! I can see maybe $2-3. It was also served at room temperature and the server only returned once after first bite, and never again until end of meal, so no refills on drinks if you wanted.   The 40 minute wait to be seated did not bug me, typical anywhere, it did take 30 minutes to get the pizza, which okay its brick oven, but what was mind boggling, was it was not piping hot pizza.   Emailed the manager for our experience and all we got was an \"sorry, we will use this for training purposes, and yes you were charged appropriately\".   It's a shame that the pizza was good and I would have gone back, I just think their pricing is unfair and that they offered nothing to even try to earn our business back, a medium pizza would not break the piggy bank to very disappointed."}
{"text":"Usually when we go to Vegas we go to Secret Pizza for our pizza. Since we were on the opposite side of the strip this time we decided to give Grimaldis a try.   Hella overrated. We ordered a White Pizza with pepperoni, ricotta, olives and bacon to go. Our pizza was soggy and the cheese was rubbery... Not gooey and delicious. I also noticed they use bigger pieces of bacon, almost like little strips... They were not crispy but chewy!   The pizza itself was hella greasy too. I could tell they use great and fresh ingredients but the textures and sogginess was killing me. The crust was great though, and the best part.  I don't know if it's because we got it to go or what but we are not wasting another meal here to find out. I am never cheating on Secret Pizza again!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! The pizza here is exactly how I like it, thin & crispy crust, with good quality ingredients! The salads are also very fresh and good and a small can feed 3-4 people easy! My hubby and I got a large pizza because it's only $2 more than the small and you get to take home leftovers :) The pizza is a bit on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for here! I just wish there was more of a selection on the menu. This place literally has 2 things (pizzas and salads)."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza.  Nice atmosphere, relaxed.  They focus on the pizza and get it right.  Coal fired ovens give great flavor.  I would try Otto's first but these guys are great for a lunch pizza or bigger groups.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This pizza is fine.  Sometimes, you just don't want to make pizza at home, or do delivery.  You just want to sit in a real, honest to goodness pizza joint that's not accompanied by an animatronic mouse singing outdated Barbra Streisand tunes from the 1980's.  But in seriousness, the pizzas are excellent, with a full range of toppings and sides, and it's easy to get enough for two people.  The service during my visit was excellent.  The server was very conscientious, making sure that my beer was poured properly without a foamy head.  It was just little touches that made the dining experience pleasurable.   Pricing was decent.  You pay for each topping separately, so a more ambitious pizza would become more costly.  But three toppings was a sweet spot.  Service was very fast for a weekend lunch, but nothing felt or tasted rushed.  I liked this place a lot in Dallas, so I am happy to see one here in town.  It's good pizza.  Very good pizza, and you get what you pay for.  I will definitely be coming back here for further 'za creations."}
{"text":"[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]  Don't believe the hype!!  I could possibly never be allowed back for Spring Training, for saying that, but I wish someone would have warned me! Why does everyone talk about this place? Seriously, after our meal we all agreed Round Table is much better...and cheaper!  We arrived promptly at 11AM when the doors opened, to a stunned hostess, who didn't quite ready to see customers even though the door read \"Open @ 11AM\". Sorry we are prompt, we had a lot to do that day...  After more than 5 people said this was the place to try, we sauntered over here. It was going to happen on our trip, no matter what. Entering the place, it's cute...at best. White and red checkered table cloths, a full bar, and a visible pizza making counter.  Our server was super sweet and very attentive, we were the only customers in there for about 30 minutes. I'm not sure how it would be if the place was packed, but lucky for us we didn't have to worry about it.  The menu is very limited. There are about 6 different salad options, but we all ordered the same one, the Caprese Salad. This salad was refreshing and well prepared. Huge slices of tomatoes and mozzarella, with basil leaves. The table comes adorned with oil and balsamic, so you can add as you please. This dish was on point and we all enjoyed this part of the meal.  Maybe this is how they do it East coast style, so we aren't too familiar, but you get three choices of pizza and a pay for each topping you add...can you say rip off?!? You can choose between 1) Regular (red sauce), 2) White & Garlic, or 3) Pesto. I believe there were four different sizes: personal, small, medium, and large. Then each topping was charged per item. This is a baller-on-a-budget nightmare!  If the taste even came close to matching the price, it would have been decent. But the pizza was lacking in all things flavor and texture. I ordered a personal White and Garlic with chicken. The crust was so thin, it was super crunchy for my liking. The cheese they use was really rubber, no stringy cheese. The chicken didn't really have any extra flavor, it did not seem processed, which was a nice added touch. The others made their own personal sized pizzas, but no one  was impressed.  The size of a personal is huge, if I remember correctly its about 6 huge slices...which most other places that would be a small pizza. So, for portion size they get a high five, but a huge pizza with uninspiring taste didn't bode well with us.  Finally able to try a cannoli, I ordered one for the table. Since I was devirginizing myself to this delicacy, I can't really comment too much on this. The Ricotta filling was good, the little chocolate chips were an added treat...but the pastry part was so hard, I could barely eat it with my fork. Like I said, I have no idea how this is supposed to look like, but it was too crunchy for my bones. I'll try it somewhere else, but I'm still on the fence.  The only reason I can see going here EVER, is the possibility of a Giants sighting. While we were there Jeremy Afeldt came in for lunch with a group, not my choice of sighting, but a Giant nonetheless :)  I heard B. Wilson goes to Oregano's (Pizza Bistro)...just sayin'..."}
{"text":"I am very picky about my pizza! Most are good while they are piping hot but once they cool down.. yuck! This pizza has got to be one of the best I've ever had. If you like a thinner crust you have to try this place! I don't know why more places don't offer ricotta as a pizza topping. It is amazing! It's somewhat the texture of goat cheese with out the funky after taste. White, red, pesto.. all of the combinations are delicious!"}
{"text":"Solid pizza and my favorite in Phoenix by a landslide.  Last night went for a work dinner and showed a few newbie Patsy eaters what real pizza should taste like.   We had two pies one pesto and one regular and both were simply amazing like always.  I recommend always adding sun dried tomatoes to a pie it really adds to the sauce.    This location is great as well especially now with the holiday season they have lights up everywhere and it's just a nice experience."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in AZ.  I got my usual sun dried tomato and cheese pizza.  As always it was great.  They cook your pizza in a brick oven with coal so you get a nice smoky flavor on the crust.  This place is amazing if you haven't been you gotta go."}
{"text":"Not quite Brooklyn Bridge, but definitely worth a visit.  Menu is expanded from original but not too much.  Crust is the key here, once again close but no cigar! What to order Do's Pepperoni Pizza-  spicy with curled edges! Extra Sauce - crushed tomatoes in Brooklyn Extra fresh basil - \"trust me Joshua you'll know!\"  Pesto Pizza - nice change  Calzone - red sauce with at least mushrooms  Dont's Just one topping... Don't over think it!  At Grimaldi's less is more.  Go single topping on pizzas...focus on the simplicity of the pie!  It's not Mozza not even Pitfire but it is still damn good!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped at this location yesterday for lunch. I ordered the Caprese salad, and he got a large White pizza, with half sausage. The salad, which was slices of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, was alright. The cheese was different from other mozzarella I've had; I don't know if it is because of the free range cows it is suppose to comes from, or if I am use to some other type. It was an alright salad, the tomatoes weren't very tasty, but hey, they're out of season now. The pizza wasn't great. It wasn't good either, it was just, well, there. Again, the cheese on it was different, it seriously looks like the vegan cheese from Pop Up Pizza, but it's not.  We had garlic and tomatoes on the whole pie, and it was meh. My boyfriend said the sausage was good, but it cost 3$ to add it to the pizza. He had wanted chicken at first, but then saw it was 5$! Every add on for pizza is 2-5! That's outrageous for the quality and quantity that you get!  I really don't know why people think this is the greatest pizza EVER, but maybe we need to go back and try one with sauce. Maybe that's the best part, I don't know, but I really didn't care for it. It was all very bland (you can't taste any garlic on the pizza, and the cheese leaves an aftertaste) and it gets pricey if you want add ons."}
{"text":"Wow. Are our kidding me. That was not pizza that was, hell I don't know what that was. In my neighborhood if you charged someone for that so called pizza you would have absolutely no business the next day. It was that bad."}
{"text":"Food was just ok not as good as all the hype. The service on Saturday Oct. 27th at around 4:00pm. After waiting for 15 min and still no drink we had to flag someone down to ask why and were told changing keg. When beer finely arrived was warm and smelled rotten. After taking our order we never saw the waiter again. Food was brought out by someone else and after waiting for 20 min after finishing our meal we had to ask someone to try and track down our waiter who I could see from our table B.S.ing with his buddy in the back room even after he was told we wanted our check he still stood talking with his buddy for another 5min until I got out of my chair and had to go to the back room to get my check.   I know things can happen and staff can get busy however after speaking with the manager she and both of the waiters laughed it off as on big deal. Food came slow service not at all and very pricey. I'll not be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza, although can be a little pricey.  We typically go and split a pizza and get our own toppings on each half.  A large pizza can easily get to $30 if you like a bunch of toppings.  However, the pizza is fabulous!!  and if you like Canoli's...  you won't be disappointed.  Currently Tuesday nights is offering a great special.  This would be the night to go if your iffy about giving Grimaldi's a try."}
{"text":"Okay, you can tell from my other reviews that I like Italian food.  I got a great salmon here once but I return for the pizza.  Crust is not quite New York thin but it's very good.  I have not found better YET!  Still looking for that \"Ray's Pizza\" experience in Las Vegas but haven't found it yet.  Good overall and take-out is nice and hot for the Pizzas."}
{"text":"We had ordered a white pizza and Mediterranean salid at the fashon show location.  On the white pizza we added additional mozzarella cheese. First the pizza maker forgot the added cheese so the addition was taken off our bill. The salid was excellent and was the best part of our dinning experience. Nancy asked for a berry sangria that had one strawberry sliced up and 6 blueberries. We were told that one strawberry was normal so we asked for an additional strawberry so we received one strawberry slice. Hum........cheap! The berry sangria was about 7 bucks. Don't throw away your hard earned money on this drink. So, we have been to this (Fashon show) location and to the Summerlin location. Summerlin is much better."}
{"text":"Had house salad which was a perfect blend of vegetables and dressing.  Very nice.   Had the Margarita pizza which was the best ever.  Sauce was awesome and generous.  Normally sauce is just color red with no taste. But here you can actually taste it. Had the cannoli for dessert which was very satisfying.  Had wine recommended by the server and it was awesome.  My new favorite Pizza place."}
{"text":"Been awhile since I've had a good NY style thin crust pizza.  Grimaldi's knows how to make a tasty one.  Haven't been to the original Brooklyn location but a friend of mine believes this location to be very close in taste and quality to the original.  Personal 12\" pies start at $9, but that's pretty much with nothing other than tomato sauce and cheese on it so you are going to have to shell out a little more for some extra toppings.  I decided to go with pepperoni, ricotta cheese, and garlic -- it was a fantastic and very delicious combo.  Also tried a slice from friends' \"white pizza with garlic\" and other toppings.  The white pizza does not include the sweet red tomato sauce as it would suggest.  The white pizza was good, but I would definitely say the regular pizzas that include the tomato sauce taste a little better and hit more on the savory and sweet parts of the palate.   I'm starting to salivate thinking about their pizza again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the pesto pizza!  LOVE!  I however was sitting in the Boca Park locations parking lot waiting for my friend and I was very very annoyed that one of their staff members pulled in the parking lot in a nice white jeep...threw a handicap pass on the mirror and jumped out and walked into work!  How lazy are you?  Not to mention YOURE NOT HANDICAPPED!  Save front spots for patrons.  Not to mention a HANDICAP spot!  Really!?  It's a rainy Wednesday morning at 9:45am. Save that handicap spot for a person who needs it!  Sorry I'm just so annoyed at that!  My mom can hardly walk with a double hip replacement ESP in this weather she is in awful pain...and a capable employee is gonna park there!  Ok that's my rant!"}
{"text":"Big disappointment! I had heard from friends that this location was not as good as the one on Eastern. How right they were, the pizza was pale and somewhat under done even though we asked for well done and crispy; with NONE of the charred irregular bubbles around the edge that is the hallmark of coal oven pie. Just a very average over-priced pizza. If you cannot get to the Eastern store, SKIP GRIMALDI'S!!!"}
{"text":"Let me first say I hate pizza! Well...not this pizza! I've never liked pizza and when ever people hear me say that they always look at me with the look you probably have on your face now. I heard you get a free pizza here on your birthday and thought well the hubs and kiddo can eat it and I'll get a salad or calzone or something.    We get there and it's such a cool aesthetic looking place. I like interesting places so ..check! The hostess greeted us and explained a little about how they do things and some back ground of the business which was really interesting.   We saw a pizza on the menu called the Don and I had to have it! It looked so yummy! So they bring this enormous pizza out and we ripped into it looked so good and it was! It was my birthday dinner and the best birthday dinner yet! So my best birthday dinner was a pizza ..go figure.    You have to check this place out! Then come back for your birthday! Go online and sign up. Easy peasy. Oh and try the Don!"}
{"text":"I know - a restaurant pizza chain, but after a decade of Chicago pizza, I know good pizza and the unique taste of the coal on the crispy crust, lightly oiled is unreal. Service is always the best at this location. I prefer to takeout, only because they play a lot of Sinatra and that genre - not my favorite - but it fits the vibe. I do red sauce, pepperoni, spicy chicken sausage, bacon, and onion. Not cheap but worth every dollar."}
{"text":"This was my favorite pizza in Las Vegas - where I lived for some time - but ultimately it's not that good. That pizza is often undercooked or overcooked ... especially considering you are able to order the cross a specific level of cooked (lightly cooked, crispy) you would think that they would be able to execute that order.  I will say that their Pizza is better than the little Margarita pizzas at Wolfgang Puck which were always inexplicably soggy."}
{"text":"We wanted to make sure they were not using partially hydrogenated oils, we called and they were not annoyed for us asking. It turns out they use olive oil! We ordered two large pepperoni pizza and it turned out they use those thicker tiny pepperoni's. They make for a better pizza!! They brought dough out for our kids which they enjoyed playing with. It was slow at the time but both managers including a different server hosted us and all made us feel welcomed. The food was great and it did not take us long to get them. The atmosphere was pretty cool, I thought their ceiling was neat!!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my cousins for the first time and then took my mom a week and half later.. This pizza place is delicious!! They serve nothing but pizza and salads.. Their meditarrian salad is so good!! I can't wait to eat here again.. Next time with my hubby.."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place.  Great house wines, great salads and delish pizza.  They give my little girl a little pizza dough to play with while we wait for our food.  The staff is very attentive and friendly, even when they are extremely busy.  The atmosphere is vibrant but homey at the same time."}
{"text":"Don't really get this place at all.  The pizza isn't that good...that's the bottom line.  I like thin crust pizza with a crispy crust.  Most of the pizza dough was soggy and oily...  I would prefer pieology/blaze over this place any day.  The toppings were okay, but really didn't stand out compared to any other pizza place.  We added spinach to our white pizza and you could barely tell if there was any spinach and the spinach you could find was almost black =(.  Also, we got two 18\" pizzas and they came out about 20 minutes apart....  The service was mediocre.  Upon arriving with a reservation, we were greeted with panic because clearly they were not prepared to seat us and had to find tables to squeeze our party in.  We also had 3 kids at our table and they did not offer us crayons/dough to entertain the kids.  Better pizza to be had for a lower price and quicker service at pieology/blaze.  The only reason I would come back here is the restaurant has better ambiance compared to the fast food pizza places."}
{"text":"this is the best pizzeria in town. hands down the dough the cheese the brick oven pizza!! amazing ambiance, service can sometimes be a little slow but still friendly staff."}
{"text":"Never had a problem here before until this visit. Ordered a mushroom anchovies personal for lunch and it came without the mushrooms. Had to send it back but they promised to make it quick for me. The pizza arrived in a quick fashion and was correct. kind of disappointed I had to eat after my friends got their pizza. However the pizza was really good and they had a special on the Oreo cheesecake for lunch. That was delicious. It was homemade also.  Overall happy with my visit. I would recommend this eatery to my friends."}
{"text":"Being Brooklyn born and having eaten at the original Grimaldi many times I'm going to say this location is quite close to the original in many ways.  Went for lunch with my wife Today and ordered a small house salad that could easily have been an appetizer for 3 people.  We also ordered a white pizza with prosciutto and arugal with shaved parmigiano.  We ordered it a little on the well done side and we're rewarded with a nice flavorful crispy pie.  Now here's the kicker.  When the manager (yes the manager not the waiter) delivered the pizza  he informed us that one of the slice had developed a hole in it during baking.  This was not a big deal for me sometimes the dough bubbles when you bake it and things happen.  What we didn't expect was for him to be apologizing profusely for the hole and informing us that he had ordered another of the same pizza personal size (which is 12 inches) to make up for the hole  This was so unexpected and they were so nice to do this that obviously a nice tip was left and the customer service over what for me was really a non issue definitely earned them  5 stars today."}
{"text":"I've been to the one at Brooklyn and the one at jersey. Unjust glad they have one near the west now. Service was great, pizza was awesome! Ambience was better than Brooklyn and New Jersey.. I'll be back! I'd go to Vegas just to eat here"}
{"text":"We were wandering around the Venetian/Palazzo complex looking for a place to grab dinner. There are a ton of good options, but we were looking for something quick and relatively cheap. We almost settled for the food court inside the Grand Canal Shoppes ($10 ish dollars per person), but luckily we opted for something better.   Grimaldi's is located near the Wynn pedestrian bridge entrance to the Palazzo. It's on the upper level with Palazzo's shopping area. We were quickly seated in the main dining room, which had an open look into the pizza kitchen where you can see the cooks baking your coal fired pizzas. We ordered a large pizza (18\" - 8 slices) with Italian sausage and mushrooms. The pizza was very tasty - I particularly liked the flavorful sausage and the red sauce.   The large size is $16, with each additional topping ranging from $2-$4. We got one pizza with two toppings to share so our total bill came out to be around $21 without tip, which is less than we would have paid at the food court!!! Moral of this story: skip the food court and get some real food in a nice relaxed atmosphere at Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"The best one outta all the locations in Vegas. Marla Gold the GM & her staff are amazing, and the pizza is always good. Every time I come in with my daughter they make us feel like family.  If you like thin crust pizza this is a pizzeria you gotta check out. Oh yeah... I almost forgot..... I hate cheese cake, never liked it since I was kid. They got me eating it here, and I will only eat it from here. It is Amazing!!!  Note there is a Cheesecake Factory next door. It doesn't even come close. Bomb pizza & cheese cake. Peep it here."}
{"text":"Okay, let's just get this out of the way right now - Grimaldi's is not New York style pizza. I know, Brooklyn Bridge, brick oven, yadda yadda.  But the style of pizza that they cook here is much closer in spirit to the artisan/VPN style pies than to the floppy, foldable slices that to me characterize New York pizza.  Until I discovered Settebello (and honestly, not until my second Settebello visit), I thought this was the best pizza that the Las Vegas valley had to offer.  Why? Ingredient quality.  One reason that Grimaldi's maintains as much share of my pizza eating as it does, in the face of Settebello's competition, is the fact that Settebello does not serve pepperoni, while the pepperoni you will find on a Grimaldi's pizza may well be the best damn pepperoni on earth. It's organic, and while I've never really a drinker of the organic Kool-Aid, when you taste this pepperoni, you'll wonder what the hell you've been eating all your life.  The sauce is basic, clean of flavor and just the right consistency. The crust is the best part of a Grimaldi's pizza, with that charcoal essence bringing out the flavor of the other ingredients, including fresh buffalo mozzarella that practically melts in your mouth.  Oh, and one last thing. The garlic powder that they offer as a seasoning isn't the granulated garlic that you typically find on grocery store shelves, it is a much finer grind, almost a real powder that actually seems to soak up the grease on top of a slice. I would love to know where I can get a bottle of this super-fine grind garlic. Anybody?"}
{"text":"I've eaten at three Grimaldi's locations and this one was by far the most disappointing experience, definitely a step below the Summerlin and Eastern locations.  The pizza was blander than anything I had eaten at the other locations - the cheese seemed tasteless and the crust lacked the charred skirt that gives the trademark smoky flavor to the pie. I don't know if they just had an off day or if they're doing something differently at this location, but whatever it is, it ain't working.  I actually left this Yelp review in my drafts folder for months and forgot how subpar this Grimaldi's location was. So I went back.  It still sucks.  Changed my original 3-star review to 2 because they still haven't gotten it right 6 months later."}
{"text":"Pizza was very good. Purchased a 16\" Pepperoni and a 18\" White with Ricotta, Spinach and Tomato. Would of liked a little more spinach but was made up in ricotta. The ricotta was spread across rather than plopped in spots. Very appreciated. Crust was not too thin, just right and toasted perfect. Was told 25-35 minutes and was ready in 20! Yay!"}
{"text":"ave you ever hung out with a group of friends and one of them starts off a conversation with,\" Hey have you ever been to (insert place here) \" and everyone in your group gets excited and its like a mini roaring of the crowd with everyone raving about it? I have been in that situation multiple times and the place they are talking about is Gramaldis and I am the guy that sits there with that awkward laugh basically saying,\" oh yeah, I know what you mean....\" When in all reality I had no clue.  Well guess what suckas, I have a clue now.    We decided to hit this location on a Sunday afternoon and grab what I have heard is the best pizza in town, I've heard that a lot and I'm not sure that I fully agree but it is definitely not due to a lack in quality or anything like that, it is just personal preference, I like thick pizza. Now lets be fair and look past the personal part of the review.  On to the pizza!!  The pizza for what it is advertised as is amazing, it is a very thin New York style pizza with fresh rounds of Mozzarella and whatever toppings you ask for. Not only is the pizza made with quality ingredients so are the salads. We ordered a salad to share and an antipasto appetizer and all of it was super fresh and crisp. I know that doesn't say too much when it comes to a salad and antipasto but trust me I have had mozzarella that was not so good before.   Since we know that the pizza and appetizers were correct and fresh the service would be the next item of conversation. The server was great, keeping our drinks full and making sure that we had everything we needed and basically handing us a slap on the hand when we asked for Ranch... That look of we don't have ranch here was priceless. I guess the thought of me defacing a true slice of New York Pizza would have put me on the goombas hit list.   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is a fan of thin New York Pizza, but it leaves me on the hunt for a great slice of Chicago style pizza."}
{"text":"It was OK. I didn't think it was anything special.  I'd had a pizza here about 5 years ago. My recollection was that it was a bit better than this time.  The crust was only so-so. It was a bit on the under-cooked side, but not too badly.  We had \"The Don.\" I like thinner pepperones so they can get crisp while baking. These were thick cut and very small. The sausage tasted very good. Ample mozzarella and flavorful sauce.  The dine-in experience was enjoyable.  The staff was friendly and the service was good enough."}
{"text":"Came here once again with the family and got 3 pizzas.  A large pepperoni and garlic, a personal tomato, mushroom and pepperoni, and a personal meatball and roasted red pepper.  The 3 pizzas were perfect for our group of 5.  None went to waste and we all left full.  My new favorite combo is the meatball and roasted red peppers.  Ive got it the last few times I have made it to a Grimaldis and its been amazing every single time.  They slice the meatballs real thin and then pile them on.  Its a great combo of flavors and I would recommend it if you haven't tried it before.  One of the managers there told us that they are looking into branching out into Southern California some time in the next few years.  I instantly got a boner!  I heard they couldn't have them out here because of the coal ovens and pollution or something to that effect.  The guy assured us that's not why and they really are looking to come out to CA sometime soon.  Cross the fingers....that would be A M A Z I N G!"}
{"text":"Still the greatest pizza out here in the West!  My wife and I got a small garden salad, and our usual.....a large pepperoni and garlic pizza.  She had a glass of their new Sangria and I had a Pepsi.  Total after tip was about $45.00.  Well worth it in my opinion.  Simply the best pizza you can get outside of NY...and even then, this will give any pizza joint in NY a run for its money."}
{"text":"So.....I have only had pizza once in the past 4 months and it was super crappy.  I needed to get some good pizza in my system asap.   Now that I live in Arizona, a Grimaldis is always close by.  Decided to come down to this one in Peoria (It's only about a 15 minute drive from my new house) for lunch.  I ordered a large cheese pizza and a Diet Pepsi.  I kept it simple today.  Pizza was as good as always.  Great thin/charred crust, fresh mozzarella, great sauce and a little basil.  It's a perfect pizza!  I ate 4 slices and brought the other half home for dinner.  Service was friendly and my waitress brought me another soda right when I was about done with my first...she was on point!  The manager came by to everybody's table and asked them how the food was too.  I will be back sooner than later.  This pizza today made my move to AZ worth it ;-).  I can't say enough good things about Grimaldis."}
{"text":"First of all.....Scottsdale is a little too \"hip\" for my liking.  All the buildings are the same color and its hard as fuck to find things.......so that brings me to this review......ordered 2 pizzas for pick up.  Get there and there are about 20 parking spaces which of course are all full and the only other option is valet.  F that I say.  Get out of the car and have my lady circle the area a few times while I go in and get the grub.  Right when I walked in there was a hostess talking to some other chick and she didnt even recognize or say hello to me for about a minute.  Thats BS.....at least acknowledge Im there and say Ill be with you in a minute or something....dont just keep talking and pretend Im not there...you know?  So finally I find out that you have to pick up your pizzas at the bar area.  I see a guy carrying pizzas so I get right behind him under the big sign that says \"to go orders\".  Well I stand there for a good 5 minutes without anyone saying shit.  The bartender seemed like a prick and even walked by me a few times and didnt say anything.  There was a lady who waltzed up next to me though and he asks her right away if she needs anything.  Doesnt even look or make eye contact with me but a lady rolls up there and hes helping her and making sure shes ok, while Ive been standing there for a good 5 minutes???. F that!  Piss poor customer service.  Finally some random bus boy asks me if I need anything and this other dude magically appears and asks me what I ordered.  Anyways.....1 Large pepperoni and garlic and 1 small pepperoni and roasted red peppers came out to freaking 41 bucks.  Paid my money and got the hell out of dodge.  The pizza is simply amazing and it gets 5 stars.  Just as good as the one I have been to in Vegas and this one was better then the OG one in Brooklyn too.  If you have one of these around in AZ, NV, TX or NY I would highly recommend it.  Some of the best pizza you will ever eat guaranteed!  3 stars becuase of the shitty ass location, $41 price tag and the \"too cool\" pricks that work there."}
{"text":"If you have read my other reviews, you know that I love Grimaldis and think its the best pizza anywhere outside of Totonnos in Brooklyn.  This Grimaldis was on par with all the others.  FLAT OUT AWESOME!  We got 2 pizzas.  A white with pepperoni on it and a regular one with meatballs and roasted red peppers.  Both pizzas were awesome.  I did notice the red sauce here was a little tiny bit more bland than other Grimaldis,  but it didn't hurt the pizza at all.  They slice meatballs really thin and pile them on.  The roasted red peppers are out of this world.  The white pizza has so much flavor with all the olive oil, garlic and cheese they put on.  Fantastic pizzas!  Our waiter was friendly and I give mad props to one of the bus boys that works there.  I forgot my hat and he came running out of the restaurant to give it to me.  Awesome service and awesome pizza=an easy 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizza is the best pizza in town. The staff there are always friendly and energetic.  It's always a pleasure walking into the restaurant as the hostesses are warm and polite.  The management team always walks around and ensures the food is up to par.  Brittany, Devon and Elmer, expect to see my family and I again.  You guys rock !!"}
{"text":"Is it as good as the one in NYC?   No.   The pizza's crust is just not crispy enough and it slightly a little too soggy (plus you don't have that NYC ambiance).   Nevertheless, it's a good pie and bring back memories.  Tip: Get half and half.   Typically most people go red but try out the white, it's just as good."}
{"text":"This place is the ny outpost of the famous Grimaldi Pizzeria which if you go to the original location, they say they're the first coal fired pizza.   The most popular pizzas are \"the don\" and \"brooklyn\".  Basically red sauce with sausage and pepperoni with the brooklyn to have some feta cheese.   You can get pizzas half and half.   I would suggest you get one side red and the other side white.  Price is a bit on the higher side but you're eating on the strip.  If you want cheaper, there is an outpost in east vegas.   Famous for: coal fired pizza."}
{"text":"Had a mushroom pepperoni pizza and a spinach salad.   Awesome crust sauce and cheese.  For Vegas this was a great value."}
{"text":"I am so happy to find a quality pizzeria in my area!   The quality of food here is top notch. The mozzarella they use is imported just for them, and it's amazing. And the rest of their ingredients are just as satisfying.  The servers are very attentive and will even serve you your pizza slices.   The ambiance is fun; very New York/Rat Pack, classy Italian-esque.  See you again soon, Grimaldi's!!!"}
{"text":"I really don't require a whole lot from a pizza (or a pizza joint, for that matter).   You don't have to hand build yourself a big old brick oven, grind your own semolina wheat into flour, milk your own cows for the milk for the mozzarella and press your own olives into super duper virgin olive oil, to impress me.  I don't need for to you to have been blessed by Oprah or Jerry or any of their friends.  All I need is a well-made and high quality pie, friendly and comfortable surroundings, a glass or two of a nice cab or syrah and friendly service and smiling faces!  That's really pretty simple (but then, I am a simple man with simple needs...almost humble, really...and noted far and wide for my humility and modesty...I guess I would say \"renowned\").  But enough about me...let's talk pies!  Grimaldi's has 'em and a ton of people seem to like 'em!  Rightly so...they are terrific!  The Beautiful Carin and I wandered down to Grimaldi's last evening for dinner...split a Caesar, had a pie and couple of glasses of syrah...sat in the back, near the kitchen and watched the chef's hand toss the pies and stoke the oven with coal...All dark wood, red accents and black and white checked table cloths...just the way a pizza joint should be!  Time to share our weeks with each other and decide how we want our weekend to look...a lovely Friday evening ritual...what a great meal and a great way to slide into the weekend!  Tasty pizza dough, savory sauce and any pretty much any combination of cheese/no-cheese and high quality toppings that you could want, all baked to blistery perfection in the non-homemade coal fired brick oven!  For those of us who don't always like to be told what to do...we get to customize our pizza (and the wait staff doesn't look at you like you just pooped in your chair for having the temerity to attempt to have a pizza pie the way you want it, instead of the way the pizza pooh-bah thinks you should have it)...that's right...have it any way you want!  And yes, they get busy at Grimaldi's and you might have to wait from time to time, but the pleasant people who work the front of the house go out of their way to make you feel welcome and wanted!  * They give you pizza shaped pagers to let you know when they are ready for you, rather than telling you that you have to come find them every hour to find out if you are going be able to eat; * There are tons of things to do nearby (within easy walking distance) if there is a bit of a wait, as well as a terrific and reasonably priced full bar to enhance your appetite; * They give you reasonably accurate estimates of the wait time, so you can decide what you would like to do (as opposed to telling you the wait is \"2 hours\" and then telling you 4 hours later that they have run out of everything and they are done for the night...too bad for you)  In other words, Grimaldi's operates as a good restaurant should, providing an excellent product and wonderful and friendly service at very reasonable price points!  I understand that one's taste in pizza is subjective and \"who's best\" is the subject of nearly endless and tedious debate...I mean really tedious...I'm not going be the one to broker peace in our time in the never ending Pizza Wars.  For me, Grimaldi's is a slice of contentment, satisfaction and relaxation...I don't care who wins the Pizza Wars, as long as I can get a Friday night pie every week or two at Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Grimaldi's before in my life. I will never be going again. My wife has Celiac disease, so she has to have gluten free pizza crust. They do have a gluten free crust but when you order a 3 topping pizza and it costs $24.00, you expect to get something larger than a 10\" personal pizza with hardly any of the toppings you requested. Let's talk about the toppings that the pizza comes with. The cheese and sauce may have been a total of 4oz and that is stretching it. The quality of crust was poor. It was a pickup order and the young lady that took the order hung up on me before I was finished. I was displeased from start to finish. I would suggest that if you eat gluten free pizza go anyplace else."}
{"text":"Dined here in the Palazzo location twice while attending a convention. One night I had kalamata olives, red and pesto sauce and the other time I had roasted red peppers and garlic. Love, love, love this pizza and Denise at the bar was great! I will be back next time in town..."}
{"text":"Had another great pizza here tonight. Can't wait to you guys get to Chicago! Great service too, Mike at the bar was great."}
{"text":"Man, after seeing all of these four and five star reviews, I feel like I must have really missed something.  I had heard of Grimaldi's and planned on trying them when I make it out to NY, but I was more than happy to check out their Palazzo location when our group of seven dropped in for lunch.  Legit NY pizza in Vegas?  Sure, why not?  Unlike a lot of pizza restaurants, Grimaldi's menu doesn't include any preset combinations or house specials (though they also offer salads and calzones).  Instead, you first choose the size and sauce base you want (regular, white with garlic, and pesto), then add on whatever toppings you like.  With two dozen to choose from (ranging from $2-$5 each), the possibilities are nearly endless!  After taking our server's recommendation for a small (it's perfect for two), my friend and I decided to share a Small White Pizza with Garlic ($16) and topped it with Italian Sausage (+$2), Mushrooms (+$2), and Green Peppers (+$2).  As far as taste goes, the pizza wasn't bad.  The toppings were decent and plentiful, and the white garlic sauce was solid.  Unfortunately though, I thought the crust/dough was disappointing.  While I liked how it was on the thin side, I wasn't a fan of the taste (somewhat bland) or the texture - neither doughy nor crispy and almost wafer like (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=qXMjD_wj8bWP8TVUdoUpcQ#KxHxBodbVP3RZ6GHtw2fAw).  In addition to our own, I also got to try a slice of my other friend's Personal Regular ($9) with Anchovies (+$2), Green Peppers (+$2), and Jalapeno (+$2).  The crust on his was slightly better, but the tomato sauce didn't do it for me (I generally prefer white sauce pizzas).  And while his mix of toppings may seem odd, they actually worked okay despite the anchovies being pretty salty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/grimaldis-pizzeria-las-vegas-4?select=qXMjD_wj8bWP8TVUdoUpcQ#79Jq5QbDxfeb3U5zJ8Gk9Q).  Even though the pizza didn't do it for me, I can sort of see why Grimaldi's is so highly received.  Given their reputation, the Yelp reviews, and the apparent superiority of their original locations, I'll give Grimaldi's another chance when I'm in NY.  With lower expectations, perhaps their Brooklyn bridge location will do the trick."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing I love the pepperoni it's so small and has just the best taste. Definitely a good place to go for some delish pizza and beer!"}
{"text":"Perfect simulated small pizzeria ambiance. Small gem found in the Fashion Show mall.   Nice if you want to get away from the strip traffic \"yes I know it's on the strip too\".   Pizza was perfect. Crust was the right density. Prices were fair. Didn't hit the wallet hard at all."}
{"text":"Maybe I just had high expectations walking in here, but I don't see myself being stoked to pay this much for a pizza if it's not absolutely wonderful, and unfortunately, this just wasn't.    The positives: *This is my favorite type of pizza.  Thin, crispy, not greasy, unprocessed cheese, fresh ingredients. *The patio area is lovely. *The passion fruit iced tea is top notch. *The meatball topping is very nice. *The cheesecake is delicious. *Portions are generous.  The negatives: *The antipasto didn't come with lettuce, so we got a house salad instead.  The house salad was large, but almost 90% lettuce.  Lame. *They don't serve ranch (I take this personally).  Not only do they not serve ranch, but when I asked for it while ordering the salad, our server didn't say anything about not having it.  I was pretty disappointed when the salad came with a big dish of \"vinaigrette\" on the side.  Vinaigrette = a monkey dish full of oil, with half a teaspoon of some murky purple crap at the bottom.  I couldn't mix the oil into the murky purple crap, or get the murky purple crap out past the oil.  It was disgusting.  If I had been told they didn't have ranch, I probably would have gotten a different salad, or none at all.  The only other dressing they had was Caesar, and I'm not a fan.  There are like 8 salads on the menu, what's with the crappy dressing selection?  :( *Pizza toppings are all sold separately from the pizza, and they cost $2-$5 each.  Adds up fast. *The crust stops tasting good as soon as the pizza cools down. *The sauce is a bit too sweet. *The service is a little weird.  The pizza came while I was working on the salad, and I told the server that I would use the same plate.  She then unceremoniously plopped a giant slice of pizza onto my plate (still half full of salad) while I was actively eating from it.  Wtf?  I think I'll stick to Metro."}
{"text":"Here's the deal! The food is very good here. I had the house salad and a regular cheese gluten free pizza.  I was charged extra for cheese and sauce? So a 12\" cheese pizza was over $20! Not sure if that is standard or if the waitress was just being difficult. We didn't even ask about it because we were just ready to get out of there after our experience.   So a restaurant can make it or break it depending on 2 things. Food and service.  Like I said, the food was great. Our waitress was HORRIBLE. She was so short with everyone at our table from the very beginning. We were there for a baseball party and we let her know right away that there would be a few different checks since there were several families there. I get it, not ideal but deal with it! I was a server and you just have to roll with it! If you don't like dealing with people, get another job.  She was completely unfriendly, short, snappy and there was a lot of eye-rolling. Everyone at our table noticed it and commented on it.  Not to mention, they seated us at a filthy table  with food all over the floor and we needed to ask for clean-up after we were seated.  The manager was standing around and never checked in on our group.  The experience could have been so much better.   Bottom line, the food is good but the service and management is poor. So if you don't mind getting service with an attitude and a hands-off manager, then go for it."}
{"text":"delicious pizza but inconsistent.  We frequent Grimaldi's often for eat in and carry out. Our favorite toppings are fresh garlic, ricotta, pepperoni, and Italian sausage. Most times everything is great. This last time there was an overload of sauce and a lack of cheese. Imagine just entire pieces striped an inch thick, the whole length with only sauce. The cheese adds the correct element of saltiness even it is not stretchy. When there's not enough (and an overload of sauce), the whole pizza is disappointing. Maybe they had a new chef because even the ricotta was just dumped on in huge chunks.  The server: She was pleasant but infrequently seen despite only having three tables.  The hostess: Was completely missing. We waited several minutes for someone to even say hi. The bar tender (why was he wearing purple?) sat us. Strange.  Hopefully this was just an off night for Grimaldi's because I'd hate if the service and pizza was going downhill. It's our favorite in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I lived in NYC for 10 years before moving out here.  The 3 restaurants I missed were Peter Luger's, Mamoun's Falafel and Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge.  Although this is the chain version..its as close as I can get to having it in Vegas which is fine with me.    I was kinda disappointed the 1st time I went since there wasn't enough cheese on it for me and the crust was kinda medium rare.  The 2nd time was much better and tasted a lot closer to the real deal.  I STRONGLY advise ordering extra cheese and extra basil on it.  Otherwise the pizza seems a bit flimsy to me."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's pizza!  If you like NY pizza, then you'll love it too.  Short of visiting NY, this is where I go when I'm really craving good NY style pizza.  It's got that perfect blend of crispy and soft thinness.    The only minor gripe I have is that I'm sometimes too lazy to pick topping combinations that would be interesting and great.  Plus the more toppings, the pricier your pie can get!  Sometimes I like it when they selections with pre-set topping combinations that I might not have thought of, but go really well together."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years! I can't get enough of this place! The food is always so fresh and the staff is always polite & attentive. Prices are reasonable and great place for kids who love pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing here! Great service from staff also. Love going here for date nights with the wife!"}
{"text":"Went back to Grimaldi's a second time, the pizza was fabulous, the bartender De'Von, was fabulous. I can see why this is such a hotspot. The manager, Vince, is there to greet you and make sure everything is just perfect. I love this place and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Awesome Caesar salad and thin crust pizza. Not quite in elite status but damn close. (Pizzeria Bianco #1)"}
{"text":"Decided on Grimaldis for my birthday dinner. I have been to the location on Eastern, but this was my first visit to the newish Palazzo location.  We decided on the large 18in pizza with chicken sausage and mushrooms. Then, ordered a carafe of their house red wine for $15. The wine was not very good on its own, but will likely pair nicely with the pizza.  When it arrived, the pizza looked really tasty and couldn't wait to take a bite. I was in pizza heaven with the first taste. The crust was thin and some what chewy. Then, the sweet and somewhat spicy sauce was added to the crust in mindful clusters, no haphazard slopping on of sauce here. The yummy mozzarella was applied in a similar manner. Lastly, the chicken sausage added a delicious meaty and spicy fennel note.  I was right, the marginal carafe wine really paired nicely with the pie by bringing out the spicy fennel and cutting through the cheesy mozzarella.  Grimaldi's, I must confess, your pizza, in my humble opinion, is easily the best in Las Vegas, possibly my favorite of all time. Can't wait for my next visit to pizza nirvana."}
{"text":"I searched Yelp to find the best pizza in the Las Vegas area and Grimaldi's came highhly recommended. I have to say after visiting the restaurant at the Rainbow Blvd location, I agree. I ordered for takeout from the bar but the bartender, Kurt, had such a winning personality that I stayed and ate my pizza at the bar with a couple of adult beverages.  The pizza is outstanding thin crust New York style. The toppings were excellent, the sauce was fantastic, sweet and savory at the same time and the price wasn't bad either. Despite being a little worried about their brick ovens being coal fired and what that might do to the crust, it makes the crust the best part of the pizza and the whole pie simply amazing.  It may not be the best pizza in the world, but it's easily the best I have had so far, anywhere, and I have eaten a lot of pizza. You are really missing out if you pass this place up."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 3 stars as an average.   I would give the food 4 stars. The pizza was above average. The ingredients are top notch quality, I would have liked a little more cheese though, it was great. Prices were average. The menu was limited though, if you are not in the mood for pizza, don't come here, not really any other options.   I would give the service 2 stars. Maybe. Our server didn't seem to want to be there, She took our order, someone else brought our food and refilled our tea, server didn't come back again until we were finished eating. We both had empty glasses and she never even offered a refill. Once she brought our check, it took her 10 minutes to come back and pick it up. BTW, she wasn't busy, we saw her standing around talking with the other servers.   Overall, we may return, the pizza was good but there are a ton of good pizza joints around town with way better service!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza - we tried the gluten free pizza as one of us had a gluten allergy. Crisp crust and pizza made to perfection. I'm not a big pizza fan, but this pizza was made to perfection. Service was absolutely fantastic, big shout out to Tommy, he really took care of us :) Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pies!!! I always end up here when i have that craving for some real NYC style pizza"}
{"text":"Love me some pizza!  :-)  My man loves the red sauce pizza but I especially crave the white garlic sauce!  This place always make me happy!  Staff is always friendly and eager to provide excellent service.  The manager, Athena -- she is FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Two thumbs up for Grimaldi's Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"I really love this place. The smell drives you in as soon as you enter. I love the layout too of this grimaldis because it has a bar on one side that has open seating to outside. On a nice day, all that fresh air and nice breeze comes in the restaurant and gives it a nice touch.  The staff here is really hit or miss, sometimes you get a very nice, friendly, animated server, and other times you get a slow one that doesn't really care you are there. My food has always come out right though, so I wouldn't say this is a turn off from the food, which is always on point.  The pizzas have always been delicious no matter what I order.  My favorite here is the pesto pizza with red sauce, or a white pizza with fresh Italian sausage. Every pizza and dish is made to order and you can watch since the kitchen is in the back, but open.  I have also had the homemade desserts here, my favorite being the AMAZING cheesecake, some are seasonal but they always have original NY style. I have had their ceaser and house salads, both of which are good to share as a starter I think, before a pizza (so I feel less guilty!) The beer selection is alright, this is no brewery, but they have blue moon and some Italian beers or wine to match with your pizza.  Overall I really just love the food in this place. I have been to them all over the valley and this is probably my favorite if not just for the pizza, the ambiance.  It is a nice dinner place for a date or special outing! I will definitely be back here for some more."}
{"text":"New york style pizza.  EVERY topping costs you $2 to $5.  Kind of expensive.  Lacking in cheese. Crust was good but honestly ate 2 slices and salad and I could have had more.  Service was great.  Not the best pizza I have had."}
{"text":"Best pizza! My favorite anywhere in USA.  Great service, friendly and have Tvs with sports at the bar. There is no better pizza!!!!!"}
{"text":"Always good here.  Today I got takeout, offered me an ice water while I waited and after ringing up my order took care of me on an ice tea to go.  Wouldn't take my money.   Great service here always!"}
{"text":"Might be the best pizza I've ever had. Great char crust from the coal oven and great flavor from that dough!!! Had the white pizza with onions and bacon.... So good!! Well poured drinks and great service. Will you please come to Chicago!???"}
{"text":"Really good pizza cooked in the wood oven. Had a regular pizza with sausage, peppers, and mushrooms that was on point. Second pizza with pesto, chicken, and tomatoes. The only negative was the chicken had no seasoning, and the pesto wasn't as tasty as Defalco's. The red sangria was also really good during a hot day. Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"The pizza is great here but I feel it is very expensive.  I am the type that loves lots of veggies on my pizza, and I can't get that at Grimaldi's unless I want to give up my first born to pay for it.  Otherwise, I would go here regularly.  My husband is a \"just pepperoni\" kind of guy and he loves this place, so we go here if he specifically requests it.  I prefer metro pizza (don't kill me)."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while because I live in Phoenix but now I remember why I love this place.  Pizza is nice and thin and crispy (be sure to tell them well done). Mushroom, garlic, ricotta and pepperoni.  First time doing extra sauce and it was great!"}
{"text":"Little overdue on my review for this awesome establishment. Was in town for baseball and called them the afternoon of St. Patty's day asking if they could accommodates party of 30. Yes, I now I was basically asking for a miracle! But guess what, not only did Jen (I believe that's who helped me) make it happen, our service was flat out awesome! Large group of hungry and thirsty adults and starving baseball players could make things challenging, however the staff knocked it out the park for us! I believe Blaine was our primary server, he did an amazing job. I didn't catch the name of the young lady that was helping him, but she worked her tail off too. Food was out of this world good! As I stated above, Service was light out! Hats off to the crew for getting it done for us! I would and absolutely will repeat when I'm back in Scottsdale AZ!"}
{"text":"Incredibly good calzones; friendly service, nice courtyard seating."}
{"text":"Old town Scottsdale's gem. Love this place.   After a night of consuming adult nerve rages at several establishments in old town Scottsdale. My girl and I were hankering for pizza. Well lookie lookie here...Grimaldi's.   We ordered a half pepperoni and half meatball pizza. So amazing!  Thin crust with chunks, not slices of pepperoni and half domes of meatballs. The sauce so flavorful. Couldn't help but dig in and chow down. Every bite so wonderful.   If you're in downtown Scottsdale you must go."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice and both times they used the excuse that they have to stoke the ovens and the pizza would take some time. However, our first visit we got our pizza within 15 minutes and the pizza was just ok, being from the NYC area and working in Chicago, I've had better. On our second visit, our pizza took over 45 minutes to get to us. While other customers arrived after us and left before us. It was terrible service.   Another reason I do not like this place is that all they have is pizza and it's not cheap, either."}
{"text":"Had great N.Y. style pizza at the Summerlin location.  Service was good and the pizza was better.   I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My mom and I tried Grimaldi's for the first time recently.  My mom had a personal size pepperoni pizza.  It was cooked well - nice and crisp crust, crisp pepperoni too.  Too much to eat in one sitting.  Had to take home the leftovers.  I had a calzone with olives and mushrooms.  It was also cooked well - nice a crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside.  I like that they use ricotta on the inside.  Good tomato sauce to dip.  Two issues - our waiter was also the bartender so he was not always good about coming and checking on us.  The manager had to pitch in a couple of times.  Also, the calzone came out almost 10 minutes after the pizza so I sat there and watched my mom eat for awhile.  I know calzones take longer to cook but we should have been warned about the wait.  Overall good food and I will try it again."}
{"text":"This was the most disappointing pizza - very sparse   Topping amounts , dry, and tasteless. I'll never order pizza here again."}
{"text":"Looking for the best thin crust pizza in town? Lucky for you I found it for you already! Grimaldi's is a MUST try. The food is always awesome and the atmosphere is great. They even have outdoor bar seating that overlooks the entire resturaunt. Very cool.  Positives: 1)Awesome Pizza 2)Amazing home-made cheesecake (2nd best I have found in town) 3) Great location and atmosphere 4)Wicked crust (chewy and cruchy and thin at the same time...awesome)  Bummers 1)It is kind of pricey. We got a large 3 topping pizza for $28 bucks. Its no pizzahut price, thats for sure! But you pay for what you get 2)Sometimes the hostesses can be a little standoff-ish but the bartenders and servers are always great!  Soooo, what's for dinner now yo...Pizza anyone??"}
{"text":"I was excited to try the famous NY brick oven pizza joint via their location in Scottsdale. We came on a Thursday nite, and didn't have to wait for a table. The pizza was HA-UGE in diameter. We ordered a small, and it was 16 inches!!! We didn't realize that their \"personal\" size pizza was 12\". That's double the size of a Pizza Hut personal pan pizza.  But anyway, the pizza was OK. It kinda fell short on taste...almost a bit bland. The thin crust didn't leave much to be desired, it sort of tasted cardboardy as time passed. I'm going to assume the pizza at their NY locations taste different because of the \"water\"....so for that fact alone, I'll leave the rest of my pizza adventures to be had in NY, and will get back to ya."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like pizza?  I had a lunch date with my niece and went to this location. Her and I are big pizza fans and Grimaldi's did not disappoint. We had the half peperoni and half sausage pizza. My niece did a happy dance with every bite and even asked when we were going to come back.  I even had to get a to go order for my hubby who loves Grimaldi's thin and crispy crust. I am a huge fan and will be coming back to this and any Grimaldi's location."}
{"text":"Date night was a success with Grimaldis pizza! We came here on a double date with my bro-in-law and ordered a variety of pizzas - meat pizza, veggie pizza, and a mix of both. The crust was perfectly cooked throughout and every flavor shined in each pizza.  The reason I am giving it four stars is because the Caprese Salad fell just flat. The tomatoes where soggy and the mozzarella cheese was very tough and not fresh. The only thing fresh in that dish was the basil which was very aromatic. We will definitely be coming back for the pizza experience only. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If brick oven pizza pies aren't one of the best things on earth then I don't know what is?! In the last few weeks I have finally discovered Grimaldi's pizza and have I been missing out! I'm usually a fan of trying new restaurants and hidden gems so unfortunately I have not tried the popular \"Brooklyn based pizzeria.\"  Although this is a chain, it is incredibly delicious and I'm sad it has taken this long for me to give it a try! When my husband and I are now craving pizza, we both already know we want to build our own at Grimaldi's!   We have been here twice and both times created our own pizza: red sauce, spicy chicken sausage, mushrooms, sweet red peppers and (the game changer) ricotta cheese! My mouth waters just thinking about the fresh slices. Overall, Grimaldi's is awesome and we are now definitely frequent flyers.   I only rated his location with four stars because the service was not as positive as I would have liked. I ordered a glass of wine but only received the mini carafe and had to eventually go to the bar to ask for a glass. I would have even ordered dessert had my waitress asked, but unfortunately she seemed a little tired. I'm sure this is a one time thing so I hope to be able to update/edit this last portion soon!"}
{"text":"The service is good at lunch and the service is good at dinner. The pizza is amazing! So many options to make a pie even if you're watching your diet. We go 2 or 3 Tuesdays a month and always try to sit outside at the bar. The patio is great! Another place I'd highly suggest!"}
{"text":"We love their pizza. Lots of different options and they are huge and the price is very reasonable. Nice thin crust. We have eaten at many of their locations and they are usually very crowded. The DC ranch location is full of kids. We prefer to grab it and eat it at home. Excellent pizza. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Sooooo good, the taste is very close to a New York slice.  They sent a chemist to NY to get their dough as close to the famous NY pizza as possible.  We most always get the mediterranean salad with a margarita pepperoni pizza. Oh soo tasty, I can devour one right about now, too bad I'm 3 hours away!"}

{"text":"Grimaldi's was exceptional pizza! We had the pepperoni and meatball original, a pepperoni calzone, and a small Caesar salad. The small salad, btw, was huge and easily accommodated the three of us.   Our server was very personable and helpful with ordering tips. At the end of the meal, when I was chatting with her, she informed us that Grimaldi's actually hired a chemist to augment Las Vegas water to the New York balance for the dough. All I can say is it was one of the top pizzas I have ever eaten! Wow!  So, we ordered a piece of Oreo cheesecake to go and just dug into it--got to say it was top notch, too!"}
{"text":"I was recommended Grimaldi's by my sister who used to frequent this restaurant when she was living in Vegas. Her first taste of this restaurant was in Brooklyn, the original location, and she's been hooked since.   For two we ordered a large white pizza and added pepperoni, Italian sausage, and mushrooms. I love NY style thin crust pizza. With the large pizza we had plenty to eat and had a few slices to take home. They have a bunch of beers on draft and a few bottled beers as well. Overall we had a great experience, I would love to grab some pizza from Grimaldi's again soon."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a great experience dining at Grimaldi's!  The atmosphere is perfect for dining in Old Town Scottsdale, the prices were reasonable, service was good, the salads were tasty, and the pizza was superb.  We only ordered a cheese pizza, but it was far better than most pizzas I have had.  The pizza has just the right amount of flavorful sauce and fresh cheese on a thin, crispy crust."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's has always been one of my fav pizza places in the Valley.  I love how each location installs a water softener/filter to get their water just the way it is at the NYC location for the best pizza dough.  My go to is their white pizza with Pesto.  I am also happy they have added the \"chef selections\" for pre-designed pizza ideas instead of having to make up your own.   The reason why I haven't give them 4 stars, and honestly its a little closer to 3.5 stars, is the price.  My pizza is relatively inexpensive but when the boy orders, I want to scream at him.  He adds all the toppings and the $9 personal pizza turns into a $20, 12\" pizza.  Even the chef selections are $$$ with most of them being $16-$18 for.  And we cant order a large and do half and half because toppings are the same price for a whole pizza or a half.    I understand with price comes quality but it makes it hard to come here often when the bill is always $40+ for 2 small pizzas.  I just need to leave the boy at home."}
{"text":"I have always liked Grimaldis pizza.  I went there tonight for pick up two pizzas and got there early - before they were even ready.   Grimaldis was busy but the bartender was attentive to me  and I got my pizza within 30 minutes of ordering.  Brought it back and began to eat it within 10 minutes from pick up.  The pizza was dry and cold.  Two 11 year old kids said they didn't like it.  It was worse than s frozen Geno's pizza.  I would rate it 3 out of 10.   I'm not sure I'll go back - I'll go to Rays, Spinatos, or Oreganos next time."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner last night with my mom and daughter. I had a coupon for a free large one topping pizza, this was sent to me because it's my birthday month. This place is good! We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and I love how the crust is thin but not crunchy and the cheese is creamy. Very good pizza, I usually only get the option of Peter piper since I have a 3 year old. As a starter my mother and I both had the Caesar salad, the dressing was very good and the lettuce and cheese on salad were very fresh. I will be going back here again, it's a lil pricey but I think it's worth it. Also here is a lil tip. From 4-5pm the restaurant redoes the coals in the brick oven, we got there at 430pm so we had to wait until 5pm for our pizza to be cooked, It wasn't too big of a deal but I don't suggest going in for a late lunch/early dinner if you're on a time constraint."}
{"text":"we drove to the highest rated pizza parlor in LV only to find out it did not have beer or wine. So we drove back and glad we did.  Closes late too.  Most of LV closes down at 9pm except for the strip."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally do a(nother) review update for an evening like Sunday night but after the last experience that forced me to walk out... I feel a strong need to share the outstanding service we received from Stanley.  I was seated before my friends arrived and didn't see a server for over five minutes. I had flashbacks to a few weeks ago and briefly considered sending a text to change our meeting place. A few minutes later, one of my friends arrived and I explained what I was thinking. As I was sharing my thoughts, Stanley arrived and introduced himself as our server.  I explained to him my experience for two reasons: (1) I never did hear about my inquiry after the last visit, I wanted someone in the place to acknowledge it; and (2) I didn't want a repeat and ruined meal. He made a point of not just nodding and smiling, but listening, asking questions, and assuring us that we would not have to worry tonight.  Stanley was fantastic! Special orders were accomodated, wine service was excellent, and his care for us (and, in fact, the other tables around us) was perfect. There was some slow going with the food from the kitchen, but we weren't about to shoot the messenger; he was communicative and helpful and jovial, taking the time to enjoy our company and make sure that we had an enjoyable experience with him. He wasn't just a server, he was a participant in our little dinner party and it made all the difference.  The food and ambiance are still (just) A-OK, 3 stars. Stanley's 5-star service is what makes me inclined to give this place 4 stars for this visit.   FYI to the winos: Bonus points for the wine list with a lot of  inexpensive yet drinkable wines - big fan! Bottles... yes, bottles, for $20? At a restaurant? Some are better than others, for sure, and they also carry a lot of variety all the way into the more expensive ranges... this was a nice discovery!   Possibility of return? I can definitely see it happening if this type of service continues!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. Knew they didn't allow dogs, but since we were at the mall, we're going to pop in and order a pizza for pickup then walk around the mall while we wait. Weren't even in the door before we were yelled at to leave because we had a dog. I understand health codes, but seriously?"}
{"text":"I'd forgotten how much I liked this place until I met a friend there on a recent Sunday.  I am a lover of thin crust pizza and theirs, while not as crispy as I usually prefer, is very, very good.  Perfect texture with just the right amount of saltiness.  The large pie is plenty for two people if you like to take a little extra home as I do.  Sauce is good, and the mozzarella is fabulous.  We dined at a high top table in the bar this time, and I prefer that to the dining room, but if you have a large group or family, the dining room has that bustling atmosphere that makes the place lively.  Great place for a date, a glass of wine with a friend, or a family outing."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself here!  This place had good pizza good wine and great cheese cake!  We tried one of each they had on hand that night!  An apple cinnamon, chocolate and oreo and I don't know that I could pick which one I preferred they were all amazing! The pizza crust was great and the toppings really interesting.  They didn't have pineapple which was weird but, everything else was great!  We had Wes as a server and he was very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list and he made the experience even better!  I would deffinately  reccomend this place to those visiting the Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Great food, lousy service. Went with my family for Christmas Eve and they were out of the first 3 bottles of wine we ordered. Server didn't come  back for our fourth attempt at a wine order til 15 minutes later. Not attentive, not apologetic. Kind of a let down on what should have been a nice evening."}
{"text":"Winning combination in traditional with peperoni, mushrooms and basil after cook. Then gently sprinkle some garlic powder and prepared to be satisfied.   As a child I could hardly eat two slices of pizza (weird kid, I know) and now I think about how Grimaldi's has changed me. Large...bring it on!  I particularly like this location because of the great service. There is nothing worse than seeing a useless manager or supervisor when your crew is busy and this store is anything but that. I commend the managers here for being so engaged and ensuring the customers are having a good experience. Anh, one of the managers, is particularly the one I see when I come. He's diligent to customers' needs and mindful of his team. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza hands down.  Crust is amazing and pretty light considering it's pizza.  We eat here everytime we are in Vegas.  Staff is very nice and they hustle to make sure you are happy.  Make sure you order enough, it's so easy to eat.  My 3 year old son can eat half a large by himself.  He's picky, and typically doesn't eat, that's how good it is."}
{"text":"I haven't had the pleasure of eating at Grimaldi's in New York City but now that I've tried the pizza, I'm hooked! Our group ordered a large pepperoni/mushroom/fresh basil and a personal white garlic pie with ricotta/spinach. Both pizzas were perfect with just the right amount of crispiness in the crust. The amount of food was just enough for a group of five. We also tried two types of dessert: tiramisu and caramel apple cheesecake. Both were surprisingly delicious (none of us realized Grimaldi's even served dessert). The tiramisu was light and fluffy while the cheesecake actually had real pieces of apple in it. If you're in Vegas and have a car, skip \"the Strip\" and come to Grimaldi's for some legit NY pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever.  Friendly service. No wait. Loved it. It's all about the location.  Just a place for pizza and time to relax."}
{"text":"I want to give 5 stars to the staff, I was in there when the MANDALAY BAY SHOOTING went down and the way they handled it was top notch. They attempted to make us feel comfy, cracked jokes to cheer us up, but I hardly touched my food because I lost my appetite worrying. The slices I had before the attack were delicious, and in the morning for breakfast they tasted just as good. Thank you for handling that situation the way you folks did, I'm prone to anxiety attacks, and you folks really helped me stay calm. The Palazzo is crazy impressive in all areas."}
{"text":"It's hands down the best pizza I have ever had!  And I am from NY where this place originated.  It's an easy 100%--The best tasting cheese, crust, sauce, meatballs in the right proportions, perfectly spun, non-greasy. Just a Perfect 10.  You feel good after eating it.  Don't get sucked into the mediocre 800 degree, blaze pizza, and the like hype.  I was barely able to digest my pizza at those joints and I would not go back even if someone paid me.  You compare the quality of the meats and vegetables and cheese and crust at  Grimaldi's to the dog food 800 degrees puts on their pie and let me know what you think.  ----  If you are alone they have a sports bar TV area you can feel comfortable sitting alone at the bar or a table near the bar.  They also have a table area if you are couple or grouped up.  Friendly Service here.  (Very unlike NYC)."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC I can't even explain in words how much I hate eating pizza around here. I had ok, decent pizza in the area but not anything to remember for a while and think to go back. We went to the pumpkin patch there with the kids and noticed the place. I was SOOO HAPPY when I looked the place up and it was indeed the same like the one in NY. We returned here for lunch and gosh was it amazing... my 1.5 year old had two slices by herself :)  It is the same taste like the NY Grimaldi - I used to go to the original one in soho all the time.  The cheesecake was delicious too. I'm happy and satisfied with the meal and I will definitely only get pizza from here going forward. Thank you, Grimaldi's!!"}
{"text":"A great New York coal oven pizza in Las Vegas! A very reasonably priced pizza for the excellent quality you get. Got a Caesar salad and pepperoni and meatball pizza both were very delicious.  Nice quiet and calm place for an afternoon lunch. I would recommend making a stop here if you're craving good coal oven pizza  Came here again and was excellent! Got salad, bruschetta, and pizza all were fab."}
{"text":"I felt like I was back in NYC-that's how good and authentic the pizza here is! If you're looking for a casual, very reasonably priced lunch on the strip in a spacious setting-this place is it! we ordered a large pizza to share with basil and their spicy chicken sausage. It was plenty of food and both toppings were delicious. The spicy chicken really had a kick so beware if you aren't a spice type of person!   The decorations are super cute: there are subway signs, a picture of the Brooklyn Bridge and the walls are brick. The table clothes are also your typical red and white checkered ones that you see in many New York pizzerias so it really does remind you of pizza joints back in the Big Apple. The service was super friendly.   I'm inspired now to try the real deal in Brooklyn! But it certainly seems like this location does a fantastic job."}
{"text":"Brought my laptop in sat down and hooked up to the wifi. What a cool place with the local vibe. Had a caesar salad and a beer. The food was good and the service was great. Big ups!!"}
{"text":"This place was way hyped up before I got there so I had high expectations.  We picked up 2 pizzas.  The place was real nice inside - nice enough for a date or something.  NExt time I would liek to stay and eat there instead of take-out... especially since the pizza can lose some of it's integrity in transit.  So we got the pepperoni pizza home.  It is a thin crust plenty of toppings.  This is way different than your average delivery pizza.  It was good.  Real mozzerella cheese and real pepperoni.  I really enjoyed this pizza.  Kind of an artisan pizza - I think these people are trying to make a good pizza.  Just a personal note, and I am objective in my reviews so this does not take down the rating - just a personal issue.  I do not like a pretensous type of pizza joint.  I want a regular type of place - nothing fancy.  Also, over $40 for 2 pizzas!!! Digity dang.   So this is a nice place - tony for a pizza joint... it serves real good pizza."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely incredible. We came here for the free birthday pizza and we were so impressed. We also ordered a Cesar salad and it as well was extremely good.   I LOVE pizza and this place was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. We only got pepperoni but it was huge for one thing, the cheese was great and everything about our experience was pleasant and delicious. Can't wait to go back for someone else's birthday!"}
{"text":"A great fresh thin crust  pizza place with nice bar and overall decor.  A must try for New York pie."}
{"text":"I visit the DC Ranch location quite often with a friend. We have always enjoyed their crispy thin crust pizza. All pizza's are made with fresh ingredients and it shows. Sadly, they have only one oven at this location and it's usually down between 3:30 pm and 4:45 PM. You can easily find a 90 min. wait for to go pizza's when they get busy. My only wish is for a 2nd oven at this popular location. I do really like their service and Pizza. Price is more than fair. Nice outside seating when the weather is nice"}
{"text":"Over the course of my Vegas trips with the No1DP I've seen people carrying pizza boxes from Grimaldi's. The No1DP, being a huge fan of NY-style pizza, never fails to get a slice every time he's in the area. It not only serves up a good slice but its location just outside the entrance to the Venetian|Palazzo complex is a short walk from the hotel the No1DP is staying (usually the Palazzo or Encore). I finally got a chance to eat here as an alternative to another nearby restaurant as I though this place would serve a no-frills yet delicious meal shortly before my flight.  CONCEPT: Grimaldi's Pizza is known for its signature coal-burning oven, specifically anthracite coal. It burns more cleanly than gas or wood and the oven reaches to 1200F. Supposedly the water system is specifically designed to emulate NY-style water that is used in making authentic NY-style pizza dough (thin and crispy).  VENUE: Grimaldi's is close to the entrance of the Venetian|Palazzo when coming from the bridge that connects the hotel complex with the Wynn/Encore. There was plenty of indoor seating on a Sunday night. They are not truly affiliated with the Palazzo so they cannot use resort credit/comps to pay for the bill.   SERVICE: Our service for the most part was attentive except at the end where she didn't catch that we wanted tiramisu to go.  We opted for the house salad with mozzarella addition (romaine lettuce, red onion, cherry tomatoes, oven roasted sweet red peppers, mushrooms, green olives, vinaigrette dressing, $6/small).  The bowl was generous with its non-lettuce toppings and certain veggies such as cherry tomatoes, red onion and olives tasted fresh. I think I got full quite quickly due to the veggies.  The No1DP is a traditionalist - he wants his pizza with tomato sauce (I gently suggested to try pesto or white pie with garlic to no avail) so we got the small pizza (16 inches - 6 slices, serves 2-3 people, $14). For toppings we got pepperoni ($3), sausage ($3), mushrooms ($2), green bell peppers ($2) and onions ($2). The crust was thin and crispy and the cheese oozed out of the slice. Pepperonis were small and crunchy, mushrooms were juicy and there was a good amount of onions. The big perk about these pies is that they are easily customizable to diner's preferences though there are certain pre-made pies available.  One big perk was that the No1DP and I technically paid with resort winnings. Were able to pay for this meal with our modest $58 we won from betting the outside track on roulette then converted it to cash. Thanks Palazzo.  This is our preferred pizza place on the Venetian|Palazzo side of the Strip (Secret Pizza at the Cosmo is our preferred pizza place on the other side as I see more than a handful of people carrying Secret Pizza boxes)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! I even liked the salad. There are so many pizza places, but I like variety and good quality toppings. Everything was fresh and hot! The food came out pretty quick as well. My little one enjoyed the pizza too. Great for families!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter, niece, and nephew here yesterday for an early dinner.  We were all starving and couldn't wait to eat.  The wait wasn't long at all but it was 6pm on a Wednesday.  The waitress was very kind and prompt with our drinks and salad.  But our pizza was another story. Other customers who arrived after us received theirs before us. After 45 minutes of waiting I asked the waitress for a discount because I felt they were taking too long.  10 minutes later the manager came out and apologized and told us the pizza was on them.  And shortly after that the pizza arrived. All the kids shouted FINALLY!!  Lol the waitress kept apologizing which I respected!  And the we all dug in. The pizza was delicious and the crust was amazing.  I would have given 5stars but the wait was reDICKulous   But over all we loved it and I wouldn't mind going back and trying it out again even though I feel like the price was a little bit too much per topping I feel like it was worth it."}
{"text":"Service was great pizza was great the downfall was that we forgot our left over pizza was about 5 slice of a 26 dollar pizza patron and I called back an hour later thinking they might of set it aside for a bit at least untill cl and the hostess said they for sure threw it away !! I myself work at a restaurant I'm a server and if one of my tables forgets their food I hold on to it for a couple hrs not just throw it away !!!!"}
{"text":"We are BIG Grimaldi's Fans! This place is as good as the others that we have enjoyed over the years.  The House Salad is awesome - split between two of us - it's plenty.  We've had every type of pizza available. The white sauce was terrific this time! We usually get the red.  And -- they have a GREAT wine list - especially for a pizza joint!  We are way too full to try dessert - but maybe another time!"}
{"text":"We got two large pizzas to-go to split between 7 girls. We ate the pizza for dinner and wanted to save some pizza for after the clubs. We called in our order for pick up.   Thin crust was bombbbb. Their ingredients were fresh, mainly their basil and their pepperoni and sausage were good too. Enjoyed the texture of the crust, yummzzzzzzz.  Best Idea Evaaa: Get a pizza to-go that night and leave it in your hotel room so you can come home from the clubs with the drunchies to bomb cold pizza."}
{"text":"The server was very accommodating but the food was not very good. Salad and pizza were palatable  but lacking in topping and flavors even with the table seasonings."}
{"text":"We've gone to Grimaldi's for my birthday for the past two years and don't plan to stop the tradition any time soon.  They start with a coupon for your birthday for a large pizza.  Then, even though the hostess had trouble making my reservation, the manager, Jeff, worked with me and went out of his way to make sure they could accommodate my large group.  The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing!  Grimaldi's is by far my favorite pizza in the valley! The prices aren't as bad as you'd expect for a restaurant in that area and for the quality."}
{"text":"A great NYC style pizzeria with a good Italian wine selection.  They feature a coal fired brick oven and a thin & crispy crust pizza amongst calzones & other entrees"}
{"text":"I can't believe that I have never reviewed this place considering how long I have been coming here.  Good solid pizza joint with great sides.  The Mediterranean salad here is massive, simple and tasty.   The service is always good and super friendly.  One of my top 5 pizza joints in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"TLDR: Like the food but not enough to put up with the service - the service was as bed as it gets.   Theres only a couple places in vegas i go to for pizza and grimaldis is one of them. I like the food and this has been my go to pizza place for a while. This review isn't about the food, its about the service at this particular location.  20 minutes for a waiter to visit our table. Had to ask the hostess twice for the server.  Server seemed stoned and didn't acknowledge his extreme tardiness. Had the impression that it was a joke to him to be bothered by us.  Server took our drink and meal order - and did nothing else for the entire meal. Wondered why we should be tipping somebody for doing the bare minimum of their job and not even doing that well.  Took 15 minutes for the bill to be collected and we had to flag down a random waiter who had to get the manager to run it. The manager was standing behind us (we were the closest table to the expediting window) and never offered to ask us if everything was ok.   Our waiter had only a couple other tables and we went at a non peak time (less than 1/3 of the tables were seated). The bar has been reduced to only beer and wine so our confusion exists as to what the heck somebody could be doing for all this other time. Also, they did not appear to be under staffed since several time we looked over at the bar and noticed 3-4 servers hanging out, talking, and not urgently taking care of their tables.   Will never be going to this location again. I could probably just as easily go to a gas station pizza hut and get better service if that's all i was looking for in a pizza joint. Looks like Duo Forni is my new go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"We live in DC Ranch and go there quite often. This visit was exceptional, we had a young lady named Sabrina for our server. We were having an OK day but when Sabrina came over she just lightened up our day. She was so full of energy and just so pleasant to speak with. She would constantly come over to see if we needed anything and timed everything perfect on a busy day from the Anti pasta with extra bread to the desert at the end. She did suggest the white pizza with extra garlic, delicious!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, Grimaldis, I love you so...BUT you really disappointed me today.  We were at the mall with our dog and read that that patio here is dog friendly. I walked in and told the hostess party for two and we have a dog.  She said NO PROBLEM... asked which patio we'd like then sat me and told me my partner could come in with the dog through the gate.  However, when they tried to enter the waitress insisted he sit out of the sidewalk next to patio on the other side of the fence.  We promptly left because the waitress wasn't even nice about it.   I totally get it, you don't allow dogs or have restrictions NO PROBLEM but tell me before you seat me, because I'm always very clear with the hostess that we have a dog with us So...dog friendly patio if you don't mind tying your dog to the fence and having him sit if foot traffic on the sidewalk.  Love the pizza here, didn't like the way we were treated today tho."}
{"text":"We were doing some shopping and decided to get a late lunch. I had the white pizza with tomatoes and the hubby had the red sauce with pepperoni. Both were delicious. I ordered the personal size and hubby had the small. I thought the personal pizza was pretty large and could not finish it. We split the butterscotch toffee cheesecake that was super yummy. The house Pinot Grigio was decent and only $4 a glass. The service was a tad slow but we liked not feeling rushed at the same time. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Not my favorite pizza picked up a couple of pizza's to go and they were mushy by the time we got home in 10 min."}
{"text":"Yum! Love the white pizza, pepperoni with basil and ricotta, and the sausage with roasted peppers. Fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I want to compliment the manager David for excellent customer service. I called in a Togo order and when I went to pick it up they realized the order was not put in to the kitchen.  David not only took care of the order, he also gave me a yummy slice of cheesecake to make up for the error.  I have to say Grimaldi's has always had great service, this  experience reinforces my decision to continue going back.  Thank you David!"}
{"text":"Never wait for a table, lines for a Fri/Sat Night are WAY too long, unless you go after 9PM.  Instead, why not just head up and sit at the \"bar.\"  Watch something on TV and shoot the breeze with THEE Best Bartender in Gilbert; Nicki!  This girl just never gets it wrong, great memory, and a pretty smile.  Whether you go there alone, or with a group of friends, Nicki will be there to make sure your needs are met.  Service up at the bar is fantastic, when Nicki is there.  OK, food wise, I do love their pizza, but I'm trying to shed a pound or two so I've gone the salad route, for now.  Just had their Spinach salad during Game 6 of the World Series, and even though Boston took it, it didn't make me chock on that Spinach;  Actually quite tasty.  That's right, I preferred to go to Grimaldi's for Game 6 than a noisy sports bar.  The place had a great crowd, but seats up around the bar were available.  It is my \"Go-To\" place when I'm home and I have nothing cooking in my kitchen, so I rate this place two thumbs up, and more, especially when Nicki is working bar. See you there!"}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had.  If you want tomato sauce on cardboard, this fills the bill.  The kale salad was great, but the pizza was really inedible.  We went there for the outdoor patio.  The nice setting didn't make up for pizza that should have been thrown out."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff... Let me rephrase, EXCEPTIONALLY WONDERFUL staff! Extremely courteous, attentive and we were left without want. The pizza was perfect, a nice balance with not overly soft crust but still having a great crispy end, not overly sauce heavy either. There was a nice moderate selection of wines too. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday right when they opened, not too busy just yet. We were lured in by the signs about being featured on TV and being famous. Ordered a small salad and split a personal pizza. We were full after that, but I could imagine two people could split the small pizza (just slightly larger than the personal) easily.   We customized our pizza with toppings so I can't comment on the pre made selections. Crust was thin. Sauce was good, maybe not salty enough for me. Cheese was super light. Some commented that this was bad, I didn't see it that way. I like light cheese.   The pizza was not life changing, but it was good. We would return!"}
{"text":"It's getting more expensive to get good quality pizza anymore, but this place is absolutely the best I've had and worth everything you spend! Grimaldi's works as a spot to bring a date, friends or family and anyone new to the joint will be extremely impressed with you for introducing them to the food. The staff at this location is especially friendly if they recognize you as a regular customer. No complaints here! I don't spend in the double digits for my own meal that often, so when I do I'd like it to be a place like this. There aren't too many locations around the country, so if you live near one or are traveling to the area, and are hungry for a high quality pie - I implore you to go!"}
{"text":"From here on out, this place is my go to place for pizza! You get to choose all the things you want on your pizza, and you can taste the freshness in every bite.  I came here for my birthday lunch with my love, I didn't let them know it's my birthday cuz IDK, really. Anyways, I got a chocolate cheese cake, and it was so good - especially since I've been craving it all week! The service was on point. I guess since we didn't come at a busy hour, our server was on top of his game. Lol  I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Decent pizza for those who like very thin, minimalist pizza.  Not being a New York pizza fanatic, I prefer more thick crust and cheese -- like Ray's in Manhattan.  The Greek salad was quite good and the price is OK too."}
{"text":"The worst pizza we ever had! Very dry crust, not fresh ingredients, bad cheese quality and it was over cooked. Salad was very soggy w old lettuce. Don't waste your money or time."}
{"text":"Always consistent and this location gets it right. Great service makes it  even better. Great pizza, good atmosphere and a good location."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to AZ, I dined at Grimaldi's Pizzeria in Scottsdale.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area.  My co-worker enjoyed her thin-crust pizza.  I ordered a calzone, which was delayed due to the kitchen making it with one of the ingredients wrong.  The manager brought out the errant calzone, explained the error and told me the correct calzone was already in the oven.  In the end, I had half of two calzone's and brought the other half of each back to the fridge in my hotel room.  They made it right, of course, not charging me for either!   Too bad I wasn't in town long enough to enjoy my leftovers.  The food was good, the atmosphere was fun and the service was great.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizzas in the Phoenix-area. Well... definitely my husbands. He LOVES, LOVES, LOVES Grimaldi's.   We always get the same pizza. Every.Single.Time.   Large pizza -- pepperoni, sausage, and red onion. (That way we can have leftovers the next day - - and I'm not a leftover person.)  SO good!  This location has more outdoor seating than the one in Chandler. Plus they have another side room/building that is great for private parties."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day and we had a great time! Great pizza, very nice server, and delicious coconut, caramel cheesecake! Would definitely recommend it and would come again!"}
{"text":"I LOVE GRIMALDI'S!! It is my favorite pizza restaurant hands down. I always go there and the quality is excellent EVERY TIME! I always order a pepperoni pizza with a caesar salad. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Two of us couples came here for dinner while we were in town for Spring Training.  It was busy, as we expected it to be so we grabbed a few drinks before we walked over.  They have a neat texting system to let you know when you've been called.   We were promptly seated in front of the kitchen - cool!  But it took a while for our server to come over and greet us, at which time we ordered drinks and (thankfully) put in our order for the antipasto (large).  The antipasto was ok, simple...the bread that it was served with could have been better.  But we were hungry and mowed right through it.  Unfortunately, that would be the last food we see in a LONG time. Should have packed a few snacks!  We waited...then waited some more...then waited...then we noticed a large party who was seated a good 30 minutes after us were chowing down on their multiple pizzas while we were still waiting on our two pizzas.    We tried to find our server but she was nowhere to be found.  When we finally got a hold of her, she offered us drink refills (which she forgot to bring) and inquired of our pizzas.  Then we waited.  And waited.  And finally the pizzas came, in quick succession.  They were good, flavorwise but we felt both were overcooked in that the crust almost lost all its chewiness.  Our first pizza was custom and had sausage, pepperoni and mushrooms.  The second one we got was The Don which I really enjoyed due to the meatballs.  We definitely felt like our order got lost but no one told us anything and so we were just glad to be (eventually) out of there.  I can't help but feel when you open so many locations of a venerated institution, sometimes your brand gets diluted and the quality/service suffers.  This was definitely our experience here tonight.  We don't need 1.5 hours to eat pizza and hopefully never will again."}
{"text":"My entire family and I love this place! The food and service is always good. We love the free pizza on our birthdays and I am IN LOVE with their Kale Chopped Salad (and I'm not even a big kale fan). Thank you for always being a great place to have a fun dinner with family and friends!"}
{"text":"JoeLLe is the nicest and most professional server I have come across in a long time in a city of hospitality that says a lot. She is funny and entertaining and can recommend anything good on the menu for your personal likings. Five star.   Chad"}
{"text":"We dined here on Saturday! This was first time and it was my birthday. The food and server were amazing and definitely would be back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered just a simple pepperoni and sausage pizza, has to be one of the best I have ever had. The interesting area to grab a good pizza. Grimaldi's has friendly staff that presents a good image for the restaurant."}
{"text":"(Review Originally Posted On: www.JerseyGirlinVegas.com )  My first ever encounter with Grimaldi's was on the second level of the Palazzo / Venetian Resort & Casino on the strip. My mother, sister and I stumbled upon it when we were shopping. The 3 of us split a small ceasar salad and a pepperoni pie! It was fantastic. So when I received an email for a free pizza on my birthday from Grimaldi's I was quick to jump on the chance to give them another try.  This time we visited their store in Henderson. It's located in a quiet shopping center just off the 215. We opted to sit outside at their bar. Although it was July and pretty warm, we stayed cool under their misting system.   They had a nice selection of beer, with the classics and a few micro brews. I went with a Sam Adam's Summer Ale, one of my favorites. We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza and while we were waiting we were entertained by the bartender. She was hysterical and provided us with exceptional service.  Just like my first trip to Grimaldi's at the Venetian/Palazzo, their pizza was exceptional! They are consistently good pizza that takes me back to the east coast.   If you want to score a free pizza, like I did this trip, be sure to sign up for their mailing list. As I mentioned in my Las Vegas Birthday Freebies post, they will email you a coupon for a free pizza for your Birthday!"}
{"text":"Got there friday 7 pm. We are surprised that we did not have to wait. First impression - good atmosphere - not fancy but attractive enough. Ordered large pizza and greek salad. Salad wad fresh but not very impressive. Pizza was excellent! Very yummy crispy crust!!! Buuuuut!!! We had to look for our server so loooooong to get our drinks refill. Our glasses were empty over 30 minutes. I guess - she was disappointed that we did not order wine?  Looking for a good pizza -reasonable price ( don't wanna drive too far) this is the place. (The service sucks but it is only one server- it is not fair to degrade a restaurant because of one very very very bad server )"}
{"text":"Rainbow Location - Husband and I went for dinner for the first time. The only items on the menu are pizza, salad, and alcohol. The pizza only comes in thin crust. Customers also have to pay for each topping including items such as basil. If you do a half and half pizza, you will be expected to pay double for each side of the pizza toppings. Also, the taste of the pizza is not all that for money spent."}
{"text":"I should probably own stock in grimaldis - thats how much I visit the place. Best pizza i've ever had in my life and seriously never had a bad pie.   Always make sure to bring my out of towners here and re-visitors always ask to come back.   I'm getting hungry just typing this review haha"}
{"text":"Came here the other day and had an awesome time! Not only was the food delicious but our server Taylor took such great care of us!!! She was attentive, friendly and informative! If you ever go here look for her and you'll definitely receive great service. Huge thanks too grimaldi's for the bomb pizza and amazing treatment.. will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"This place is decent, but it seems a bit overrated in my opinion.  The pizza is very thin crust- but not like Brooklyn style floppy greasy pizza.  More gourmet fancy style.  The service here was good, atmosphere was dark and intimate, and the prices are a bit high.  Overall, nothing specatacular in my opinion, but I'd eat here again if someone else really wanted to go."}
{"text":"Food is always HOT and FRESH! Service was average as the wireless seemed quite distracted. We had the bruschetta trio (artichoke hearts, olives and the last was tomato and basil). Kiddo got a large pizza one topping with his birthday sign up. Happy 17th birthday Brandon, and thank you Grimaldi's for helping us celebrate it."}
{"text":"So my brother is getting married and we had the rehearsal dinner here last night. It was so nice! I had no idea that they had a bunch of party rooms in the back of this restaurant. They're very cute. So the party went well and everyone who worked there was friendly and helpful. The food was good, especially the salads (caeser, house, and caprese) and the artichoke dip. Yum, I would go back to eat those again. The pizza was just ok, we had a bunch of different types, but I just didn't think they were anything too special. I thought the pepperonis tasted kind of weird, maybe just not what I was used to. The plain cheese pizza was really good, so I'd probably just go for that if I came back. Also, parking is a bit difficult in the area, they have a lot but it is really small. We had to park a few blocks away and walking in heels was not so pleasant. That's not really the restaurant's fault though, it's kind of the nature of the area."}
{"text":"Great pizza. It's affordable and delicious. The crust is utter perfection and I simply don't get people who choose Chicago pizza over NY pizza. I feel like eating this pizza would convert you. The only issue is that it's in the Palazzo and it felt tucked away (and not in a good way) past the casino and into their mall."}
{"text":"I can write reviews again!! Came here for my last day of work goodbye lunch and yummm. Only got the chicken pesto but it was delishh. Perfect amount of sauce, chicken and the crust was just right!  They also have a parking lot which is helpful in Old Town.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 1 pm, was seated immediately because it wasn't busy which was nice. Had to have the pizza fix because you know you gotta have pizza when going to watch NINJA TURTLES! .   I ordered a personal pizza which is a 12\" pie with 6 slices, good proportion. I had it topped with bacon and onion and their famous sauce is up to par. I'm used to Frank Pepe's in New Haven, CT which is voted Best Pizza in the nation and world renowned.    Grimaldis is definitely best in Las Vegas but doesn't compare to Pepe's.  But it's up there so it does deserve 4 stars, service was good and the atmosphere fits the style of the restaurant. The crust of the pizza is perfectly thin, and crunchy, love that. The pies came out in a reasonable fashion. The pizzas are priced pretty well, although I think they should have some signature pies. Definitely will be coming back. Always love a good pie. The white pizza with garlic is awesome as well. I recommend this place to anyone.   My favorite combo is bacon and onion , try it out."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and red sangria it was very good!  Loved the decor with old b/w pictures.  our waitress was super friendly and attentive.  Only downside was cheap  toilet paper in the women's restroom...too hard to enroll... comes out in little pieces, annoying"}
{"text":"Definitely NOT the original.   I went to the one in Brooklyn, better than the LV one. LV one too crispy. They also served another table our salad. Sauce was bland. I like the original better."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizza- It was probably the BEST pizza we've ever eaten! It was so good. Supposedly coming to Colorado sometime this year! So excited! We didn't eat the salad, or anything except for a pepperoni & italian sausage pizza. We got ricotta cheese on 1/2 of the pizza. (Which was amazing!)   We did research on Yelp before we chose where to go eat for pizza and so glad we went to Grimaldi's. Wonderful customer service also. Two managers came to see how we enjoyed our meal & the server was very helpful and knowledgable.   We sat next to where they made the pizzas, so we could see it all done before our eyes. Very nice to see how they cooked it and how precise they make each pizza. Can't wait to eat it again! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after I of course checked it out on Yelp. We enjoyed our lunch. I had pepperoni and mushroom while my husband had The Don. I highly recommend this wonder pizza place."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of pizza places in Vegas - and I won't sit here and claim this is the best of the best in town - but it certainly shares the top spot with one or two others.  Grimaldi's is absolutely delicious!!  First off - the crust.  It's that thin NY style, with a great char flavor - it combines crispy and chewy in just the right way.  Secondly - the cheese/sauce - thin slices of buffalo mozzarella, with a delicious tangy/sweet red sauce makes for a combo that provides enough flavor that you really don't need any additional toppings - that being said...the toppings are delicious too!  I would recommend this place to anyone in town!  One thing I would suggest is keep the additional toppings to a minimum - I never get more than two - because they start to take away from the amazing flavor the pizza already has.  My personal combos are Pepperoni/Mushroom and Kalamata Olive/Mushroom - yummmmm :)  Service has always been great - even during the busy times.  Enjoy!  Seriously...go. Now.  Do it."}
{"text":"Hosted my BFF's baby shower here.  They were great!  They took excellent care of our group.  Everyone loved it.    Their pizza and salad assortment is fantastic."}
{"text":"Came here again on a recent trip to Vegas and was able to order a pie that came very close to the one that I had in Brooklyn.  Get extra sauce, extra cheese, garlic and basil, but just make sure that you specify the basil be put on the pizza after it comes out of the oven.  Absolutely fantastic version of margherita pizza and it saves you a trip to NY."}
{"text":"Large pesto pizza with ricotta, sun dried tomatoes, and chicken is a great combo for pizza! The pizza here is really hit or miss and the misses are normally take out orders for us. Don't know why maybe it's best hot and right out of the oven but by the time we get home the pizza is meh. That's why I only give it 4 stars. I would give it 5 because when we do dine in the pizza is so great! The only other con I have to add is sometime the crust is a little bit too burnt for my liking. It has only happened once but when it does I hate spending 35 dollars on ONE pizza! Expensive for pizza but great dining experience."}
{"text":"omg this pizza is second to none. I enjoyed the Caesar salad as well, I love the ambiance this location has to offer. Please go to another locatiion so I can enjoy this one."}
{"text":"Today was my family's first time at Grimaldi's, even though we've heard so many times we needed to try it.   We were seated right away by a pleasant host who briefly explained the menu. We were then greeted by Lindsay, who explained the menu and specials more in depth.   Our two year old son was given some dough to play with and our order was taken. Lindsay even offered to water down our son's juice. That was cute. :)  We ordered a Caesar salad and the BBQ chicken pizza. Both were outstanding with my wife and I remarking how we wanted to order another because it was so good.   We will definitely be at Grimaldi's again. I also just want to remark that as I just watched the staff interact with us and other customers I was very impressed. There is a very kind, helpful and caring staff here. High marks for Lindsay!"}
{"text":"I had this pizza in Brooklyn and thought it was the BEST pizza I've ever tasted. So we had to try this spot when we were in town in Vegas. This is located at Palazzo on the second floor. There was NO wait when we went around 2pm for lunch on a Sunday. Lots of space with a bar. I couldn't bring my fat tuesday in but they were kind enough to store it in the fridge for me.   So we ordered a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. Very tasty and good upon the first bite! We asked for the garlic powder and added to our pizza which made it taste a little better, but the garlic powder wasn't as strong as what we had in NY. I have to agree that the pizza was delicious, but it wasn't as good as what we had in Brooklyn's for some reason. It took about 20minutes for the pizza to come out. We also ordered a personal size pizza with white sauce. I didn't taste it but my friends did and agreed it wasn't as good as the regular pizza.   The service was okay, the server could put a smile on his face at least. I heard the less toppings you put, the better. Don't overload your pizza! I recommend regular pizza with tomato sauce with basil. A side story: my bf left his credit card here but they were kind enough to keep it until we picked it up. Thanks! 4 stars for excellent pizza and no wait! I highly recommend this spot if you're craving NY style pizzas."}
{"text":"As far as pizza places go, Grimaldi's is the best you can get out of a chain of restaurants. I especially like this location because there is plenty of parking, unlike the location on Eastern.    The staff here are attentive and quick to fulfill needs, including letting the kiddos play with dough before the meal arrives. Your cups are always full, which is good.  I love the pizza crust here, because they get it right - no one wants soggy crust. My favorite pizza is the meatball and ricotta with fresh basil. I also like the Caprese salad they have here, as well as the bruschetta.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and loved it every time.  I moved to SoCal 5 years ago and I look forward to the occasional trip to Phoenix to come here!  Salad and Pie - you can't go wrong here.  Totally family friendly as well."}
{"text":"It's wrong of me to give this place 4 stars instead of 5. So let me make amends."}
{"text":"The pizza here is terrible and the staff was unbelievably, weirdly aloof and rude.  I'm not sure they even realize that they work in a restaurant, that we are your guests and are paying to have a good experience and have fun.  No wonder the place was empty.  Go back to New York and take your coal with you."}
{"text":"Had a craving for pizza so decided to go not too far to the house here. My fiancé and I sat at the bar outside and enjoyed a drink and good company by our bartender Kurt. He was very attentive and suggested different items on the menu. The small pizza we ordered looked like a large. So make sure you bring your appetite. We also had a small Caesar salad which was enough for the both of us. Food was great and so was service! Definitely suggest eating here."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it.  I didn't sit down at the place to eat, I called and picked up from the restaurant.  I got the House Salad and a large pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  Very enjoyed it. 5 stars because the dough and flavor definitely at the highest standards for Pizza.  Definitely will order again"}
{"text":"Love this place. I make it a point to stop here whenever I'm in Las Vegas.  Coal fire pizza is excellent, beer is ice cold and service is always great.  Try'\"the Don,\" my favorite!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We got the antipasto and bruschetta trio to start. Split a large The Don pizza. Everything tasted so good. Comes close to real New York pizza. I love the decor and music. Checkered table clothes giving that old school New York feel. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!!!! Great service and great food! Reasonable price compared with other local restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is my favorite place for pizza. The coal-fired brick oven makes a huge difference in the way the pizza tastes. Pizzas made at Grimaldi's are thin (my favorite kind) and they use large slices of mozzarella cheese, the best tasting pizza sauce (just the right amount of tomato, salt, and spices), and whatever toppings you prefer. I also order a delicious caesar salad with my meal every time. Every bite is like a piece of heaven in your mouth. Even pizza leftovers the next day taste awesome!   I fancy the bar layout because it has two sides, one inside and one outside for the patio. I had a house wine once, which was tasty. More recently, I order the Honeymoon beer draft, which I have yet to find elsewhere. Lots of drink selections are available, including some draft beers from local breweries.   The service here has been tremendous lately. I used to dislike the young and snotty hostesses, but I haven't seen them in months (hmm, i wonder why lol). The bartender was very friendly and social. She even let me try some draft beer from a local brewery.   Its about a 10 minute drive from my place, so I often go there more times than I should! They don't deliver, but take-out ordering is a painless procedure done at the cashier located at the bar. This place is hype-worthy. I've even gotten my g/f and parents hooked on Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for a work conference since Sunday and I've already been here twice! The pizza here is Uh-mazing!   We had a great server who very honest from the get-go, which I always appreciate! It was my husband and I the first night and he said most parties of two can share a small salad and small pizza - definitely true!   We ordered the Mediterranean small salad - super fresh and customized a small pizza with: artichoke hearts, jalapeños, black olives and bacon  Fyi - the toppings range from $2 - $3 each on top of the $14 price for a small pizza, but it was worth it!   Returned for salads at lunch yesterday and may hit this up once more for pizza before we leave tomorrow! Will definitely return whenever I'm in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"I've heard so many amazing things about Grimaldi's, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's good because ultimately the good word led me here, but it also gave me unrealistic expectations.   The salad options are delicious and generous, and so is the wood fired, thin crust pizza. We had the white pizza with spinach, a pepperoni, and a spicy chicken sausage. The white was creamy crunchy delicious, the pepperoni was solid, and the spicy chicken sausage lived up to it's name. It was all pretty darn tasty.   It is expensive compared to other local pizza joints, but the quality is there. The drinks are overpriced, but that isn't unusual. I suppose the problem is that I was told this would be the best pizza out there over and over again. I expected too much. Instead I got a pizza that can hang with the other great options in the area, in a cool environment, which was somehow both a win and a disappointment."}
{"text":"Before we even set foot in the restaurant, the hostess had already opened the door and greeted us with a smile. As soon as we were inside, another 2 staff members also greeted us while smiling.  Our server, Marilu, seemed to genuinely enjoy her job, and never stopped smiling and having a great disposition the entire time we were there. Her service was great as well. Our drinks were never less than half full before she would ask if we wanted more.  The food was absolutely amazing. There was a bit of sticker shock looking at the menu, for two pizzas, two sodas our bill was $50. Expensive? Perhaps. Was the Grimaldi's made mozzarella cheese, some of the best I have had? Oh yes. Everything about that pizza was great.   Watching the pizza makers toss and spin the dough, one handed even, until it was just right, then sliding it into a Pennsylvania coal fired pizza oven just lead to a mouth watering wait.  We will have to go back to try more of the toppings, and will likely only go to this location, as the service stood out. There are not many places in Las Vegas with anything approaching mediocre service. Grimaldi's staff was not just great in comparison, they were great on a totally different level."}
{"text":"Had an issue with a take-out order this evening concerning some confusion between the hostess and the take-out order desk. Had to leave without my order, but the manager call back shortly after and profusely apologize for the problem, and took care of it beyond what most restaurants will. Very satisfied with their customer service. And most importantly some of the best pizza in town."}
{"text":"Food: Small Caesar salad, Large Margherita Pizza with Italian sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives added. I really appreciated that our server suggested that we could make 1/4 of the pie pepperoni for our daughter. Super helpful! NY pizza was thin and tasty! Salad was very fresh and surprisingly big for a small.  Service: Friendly and attentive and appreciated the 1/4 pie tip!  Ambience: family friendly and very cute. NY decorated with chandeliers made from old wine bottles. Loved the open air bar that provided a nice breeze in the restaurant. Will be sure to try patio dining next time.  Location: Same plaza as Protein House and Cafe Rio on Eastern.  Will definitely be back and will try the NY cheesecake."}
{"text":"This is actually one of the few restaurants in Vegas that is not too far off of the original ones in NYC. The Service was good and the pizza was awesome and the price was very reasonable. I wait till our last day to come here. When i come back to Vegas this will be one of my 1st spots to visit."}
{"text":"We were in STV visiting family and decided to go out to dinner. After doing the usual Yelp routine and checking out the restaurants we decided on the one with the simplest menu (and a calzone sounded so great!) We came in with the two of us, my almost 2 year old in a stroller and 3 month old being worn by yours truly. Usually we get a dirty look coming in with kids at dinner time but the front desk girls were pretty friendly. I asked if we could have a table outside (obvs because I'm bringing kids lol) and she said it would be about 30 minutes. We walked around for about 20 came back and our table was ready! They gave my daughter pizza dough to play with (thank you!) And we got our drinks immediately. Server was prompt and really attentive without being annoying. I wish I could remember her name. We ordered a small calzone for hubs with sausage, pepperoni and jalapeño. (small will feed like 3 people no lie, so beware). I ordered a personal (feeds two) with chicken, spinach and pesto. They all come with ricotta and mozzarella built in. BEST CALZONES I'VE EVER HAD. Hands down. Caesar salad was great as well and their chocolate mint cheesecake was also really tasty, especially if you're a thin mint lover like us! Overall we left happy, full and with tons of leftovers! Definitely coming back next time we're out here."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious!! Same taste and quality as the other Grimaldi's I have been to before so you can know what to expect if you are a veteran. Grimaldi's is my absolute favorite pizza in the world. Thin crust, fresh ingredients, real mozzarella, mmmmmmmmmmmm.  I highly recommend - do it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! We go there all the time.. Had great service last night (12-22-17), our server Kendal Short was amazing!! We have always had a good experience with all of the servers, and the \"guy behind the bar\" is always great to talk to.."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I love Grimaldi's, and this is my 2nd favorite location in metro Phx, just behind the Chandler location.  The coal-fired, ultra-high-heat cooking method produces a pizza that's great in ways that are hard to describe, you just have to experience it firsthand.  Believe the hype - especially when it's coming from Brak - this is the real deal."}
{"text":"Will, Mgr, tried hard accommodate 15 of us; the hostesses persisted in not following his directions to seat us. It was 1 hr and 15 min before we were seated. The waitress was excellent. The free cheesecakes were delicious."}
{"text":"I've always driven by or walked by this place in the san tan mall and there is always a wait outside so you know this place must be good. So we decided to try it last night, it was a half hour wait but I didn't expect any different so we ran to one of the stores near by.  Once we got seated,  I was with 2 others so we shared the large house salad. It was a yummy salad, and I am a salad lover. The dressing was good and I was a fan. We also got a large (its big) mozzarella pizza with basil and fresh tomato. It was soo good. Its the thin crust pizza, and the crust is crispy and good also. My favorite dessert ever are canolis which they have here so we had to get one to share and it was delicious. So if your looking for a good pizza place, go here!!"}
{"text":"It was good pizza. Their menu is very small. I believe the experience would be better if they added more sides such as wings and such."}
{"text":"The service was great and I liked their pizza. I agree with my fellow yelpers, it is 4 stars and I think the reason is the \"high\" price compared to other pizzeria's.  I already ate at 3 location and they all where consistent regarding service and how the food is tasting. Their wines and sangria are also recommended. Overall it is a nice choice for a family dinner or a date night."}
{"text":"Pizza? Excellent. Service? Fine, right until the end . . .   PROS: we got 2 large pizzas. Crust was tasty and the toppings all had good flavor and a fresh quality. Large House Salad was nice, and easily satisfied 5 people. Wine list was decent and the prices were reasonable. Our server, David, was friendly and took good care of us.  CONS: why 1-star? The food, wine and server were good--no denying that. The problem? A group ostensibly had the patio area reserved. The roadblock?? Our party of 5. We were seated at 5:30 pm. By 7:30 pm, the large group AND several of the restaurant staff made it clear (verbally and non-verbally) we were in the way. To wit: one of the group's females (bleached blonde, oh so close to 50 and chubby) in the group pointing to our table and telling a nodding server, \"This needs to go.\" LoL! Was she a Real Housewife of Tempe??? The non-verbal? Restaurant staff placing a dozen extra chairs for the group just a few feet from our table. The final and best part? An employee (not our waiter) asking us if we needed anything else, and saying, \"Okay. You know it's a special thing to be able to eat on our patio.\" Really . . .? 4 of 5 of our party unanimously agreed his tone and body language was communicating, \"time for you to move on\".  I rant, but a fun and good meal was ruined. I complained to a manager. She was apologetic and even gave us a gift card, but the damage was done. We tipped David 20% for the service and food, but left w/ a very bad taste in our mouths. Caveat emptor. Our family will not be coming back.  RS"}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's pizza but I am over their slacadellic workers shipping out cold pizza pies.   If I take another cold pizza from this place back to my home I'm gonna have a fit.   I'm writing this a few days later then when I went because no one has taken it to call me back in regards to their mediocre customer service and food product.   Two large pizzas the girl says it will be 45 minutes. Ok well we watched the guy charge my card etc talk it up while our pizzas sat on the ledge next to him.   These kids have zero respect for people's time or their money. I pay for hot pizza not cold pizza sitting out way too long because the girl on the phone doesn't know time management mixed with current in house business.   Your pizzas are not cheap I'm insulted you even let that cold crap out the door"}
{"text":"We went here today for an early Saturday lunch.  Rachel was our server, she was very pleasant and professional.  She answered all our questions about the menu.  The manager, Vince, came by and made sure we were happy with our food.  And ah, the food.  Oh yes, the food!  We split a house salad (very fresh, the dressing is perfect) and a small Margarita pizza.  Oh yes, the pizza.  Oh my, the pizza!  It was excellent.  All around, the experience was so good we are going back very soon.  So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, clean restaurant. Pizza was average, service was barely acceptable. Maybe she was having a bad day.... I paid $56.00 for lunch (including a $10.00 tip) and I felt like I was an inconvenience to her."}
{"text":"Been here hundreds of times and never get tired of the amazing food! Special thanks to Paulo, he ways makes us feel welcome and offers the best service!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. By far best pizza in Vegas. Thia is old school New York pizza at its finest. Watching them prepare your pizza is like watching an artist paint a portrait. I like how they use are sausage and the crust is so light and airy. Super clean place. Will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"OK. So, this is the best pizza west of the Mississippi river. Thank you for opening a store in LA!!!!!! Its a 100 min drive to the LA location.  Its so good that my 4 daughters ask me to drive there a couple times a month!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!! Tim and Anna"}
{"text":"My husband, a friend, and myself decided to go to Grimaldi's last night. It was not my first go - round at this amazing pizzeria. I have a long history with Grimaldi's since they first came to Vegas. We usually pick up and take home.  I feel they can do no wrong. The service is stellar, the food is great, and the place is poppin'. It isn't a large location, so if they get busy you may have to wait. We were told there would be a 25 minute wait, which was fine with us. We went to the bar outside (it has one side outside and one side in). We ordered drinks from (I believe her name was) Shandra and her service was fast and super friendly. I also started with a small Mediterranean salad no onions (devil's food).  The oven they cook in is a coal brick oven. The pizza comes in different sizes small, medium, and large. You can get tomato sauce, white pizza, or pesto. We get the large white pizza with pepperoni and fresh tomato all the time. Last night we added ricotta cheese on half. The second pizza we got was a large white with meatball, fresh tomato, mushrooms, and added ricotta on half. Why half you ask? Well, I am not a fan of ricotta at all. BUT let me tell you, their ricotta is the exception to everything I know about ricotta cheese. It is smooth, creamy, and not gritty at all.  Of course it was delicious as always. The biggest downfall is you will pay $2-$4 per topping you get. We spent $100 with tip last night. It is expensive, but not a typical trip cost for my hubby and I. Normally it's around $25 plus tip for our regular. We didn't get dessert last night, but I have had their cheesecake. Holy moses it's delicious.   I cannot say enough about Grimaldi's. If you haven't been, you need to go. Like, now."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's! The staff and service goes above and beyond of what is expected! They are always busy but they don't let that slow them down!!! My pizza is always hot and fresh when it arrives at the table! If there is ever any issue they make sure that it is handled properly and in such a way that it seems as if nothing ever happened!! I have only had one incident and it was something that was out of their control! When you come ask for Sherri! She works Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 5pm-close! Seriously the best server they have here and super sweet!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Sat at the outside bar on a delightful Friday evening with beautiful weather.   Started with the chicken Caesar. Portion size was perfect and the flavor of the Caesar was on point.   Ordered a large pizza with garlic, spinach, green peppers and mushrooms. Great combination. Pizza was perfect. I really enjoyed it.   Had the $10 dessert trio which was also delish. Comes with 3 desserts of your choice. We chose Oreo cheesecake, cannoli and tiramisu. Paired off with a lovely glass of red.   Service was great, ambiance outside was relaxing and food was perfect.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Kicks the crap out of Pizzeria Bianco :)  My boyfriend and I go to this place at LEAST twice a month, sometimes more with his family in tow.  The pizza is always fresh with the perfect amount of coal-crispness to the crust and the cannolis are to DIE FOR. SERIOUSLY.  Highly reccommend :)"}
{"text":"We love coming here. House salad was great. Can't go wrong with any pizza. Kids love to play with the dough they give. The service is always good here. Fast and friendly staff make this place great!!!!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could say that the pizza at Grimaldi's lived up to the hype.  It isn't bad, it just isn't that good.  If it were more reasonably priced I'd go again, but for an average of $17 for a small pizza, it just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Perfect pizza, excellent service, fresh ingredients. This is the BEST location. Unfortunately there is sometimes a wait and it can be loud...but the food is great. Use the yelp app to see if there is a wait..."}
{"text":"WOW!!!! Okay, I am so not a pizza person. A slice a year will usually do me. Well while in Vegas my husband had a craving, I agreed and figured I would just get my usual salad. (I had the yummy spinach salad by the way) When the pizza came out it look so good and smelled irresistible. When I bit into the thin crispy crust, it was obvious unlike any pizza I had tasted before. The Coal Oven crust was crispy and charred, the toppings were plenty and fresh. And I loved the sauce on top so no chance of sogginess!! Our pie was topped with double sausage, artichoke hearts, ricotta cheese and mushroom. Writing this makes my mouth water. Well done Grimaldi's  We'll be back next time we're in town for sure :)"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and calzone.  We got a new server...2 days on the job...Casey....wow...now experience and she was absolutely amazing.  A great addition to a great local restaurant.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have a mixed heart about this place. Let's start with the good. The pizza is amazing.  Perfect crispy-chewy crust with just the right amount of char, a tomatoey sauce, fresh mozzarella, and quality toppings are perfectly balanced. Salads and desserts are also fresh and delicious. The not-so-good is this place isn't geared for the crowds they receive. A recent Saturday night was particularly bad. We were warned that it would take 45 minutes for the pizza to be done. It ended up taking an hour and 15 minutes. While this experience was worse than usual, it nonetheless is an example of their general problem.  They have only one pizza oven I can see and its capacity does not seem to be up to the rush.  If the management fixes this issue I'll bump my review up to a 5. Until then all I can recommend is carry-out."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Grimaldi's when I stayed in NY but sadly never got the chance to try it out. When I saw there was a location in LV, I knew I had to check it out!   First, the place is hard to find! It's all the way in the back corner of the Shops of the Palazzio. It's not a place you can stumble upon.. you have to go actively looking for it. We came for lunch on a Sunday and the place was empty. The atmosphere is great, space is ample and relatively clean-- great place for larger parties. The service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and very thorough when taking our order.   The pizza was ok, not as amazing as I expected it to be. The tomato sauce was watered down and the pizza crust was really soggy, making it really hard to eat. The calzones on the other hand were delicious-- stuffed with toppings w/ a side of marinara for dipping.   Not sure if I'll be back, as it's not in the most convent location and the pizza is eh ok. I'm a huge pizza nut though, so if I don't find a better pizza joint on the strip, I'll be more than willing to give Grimaldi's a second try."}
{"text":"The same quality pizza Grimaldis is famous for in Brooklyn.   This is the friendliest pizza restaurant you will ever find.  The thin crispy crust is something Grimaldis is famous for.  It is worth the trip round the world.  Las Vegas is really the restaurant capital of the world!"}
{"text":"Really stinks when you love a place and have to leave because every table that walked in after you finished before our pizza even came to the table. Not that the server wasn't aware as \"our pizza was the next out of the oven\" for the next fifteen minutes. I hate to say goodbye to an old friend, but waiting an hour at a table for pizza is redic.... Left hungry, empty handed and got a \"have a great evening\" as we left, priceless."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled upon this place while trying to find a quick bite before we left to the airport.  The food was great!  The pizza and salad we got was really delicious!  The staff was very friendly.  And I love all the New York decor that was all over the restaurant.  Pizza was very New York authentic!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The aroma of this place can be smelled from at least 50 feet away - and it is HEAVENLY. This restaurant definitely has the look and feel of authentic Italian cuisine. I only got the food to-go, but the service I did experience was great!   Although I'm not a huge fan of New York style pan pizza, the food was delicious! And I really liked how you're able to personalize any pizza you want. I got a pizza with half cheese, half Italian sausage and meatballs. Wasn't a big fan of the meatballs, but the sausage was great and the cheese was amazing! This is the place to go if you're looking for a pizza pie!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  Was in town on business and went here with a couple of coworkers.  We ended up getting two pizzas and salad.  I loved the meatlovers pizza, the crust was great and was filled with lots of toppings.  We also got a pesto artichoke pizza that was also great.  Overall if I were in the area again I would def check this spot out again."}
{"text":"So far my favorite pizzeria, their pizza is so delicious!  I love the thin crispy chewy crust.  My husband and I order a large pizza, half white and half regular with toppings.  Must get ricotta cheese as a topping, soooo good!  It can get a little pricey but we think it's so worth it.  I always take my friends and family who are visiting from out of town and they love it!"}
{"text":"You might think its just another pizza place...and it is, but its just a liitle better. Great spinach salad a d thin pizzam I had a merlot at lunch and my friend (?) Called me a wino. Well, Ethan took umbrage with that and told my friend. Later she made another comment which I didn't hear but Ethan did  He said, \"Well she's at it again!\" Ethan was my knight in shining armor.  He risked his tip for me. All was well and his tip didn't suffer. Thank you to Ethan and Grimaldi's for a grest lunch. Hic"}
{"text":"I would have to agree with my fellow loves ones this is one of the best pizza I have ever eaten. You know a pizza is really good when you're cravings for it seconds, minutes, hours, days after. OMG, I wish I can get a slice now.   A group of us were staying at Palazzo and one of the best thing about palazzo is being able to get our pizza and take it upstairs. Not just any pizza, one of the best pizza voted on food network. We ended up ordering two large pizza and a Caesar salad.   If you like thin crust pizza. This will be your heaven. The toppings and sauces and the way they cook it is like no other. It's just so delicious. I also love that they cut big slices cause one slice is like two slices. However, you can trick yourself that you have only eaten one slice and can go back for more. Love it.   The pizza we picked out had meatballs, pepperoni, pesto, and mushrooms. It was a wonderful combination. I would order it again.   This place is a for sure stop in Vegas. Luckily, we are allowed to eat anything and everything when we are on vacation. :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in the Valley. I've had several different combinations with ricotta and sausage being a few of my favorite toppings. Grimaldi's is always a hit amongst me & my co-workers for lunch. It can get pricey though when going in a large group. We often pay $15 each (incl tax & tip) for 2 slices each. It's so yummy though! Their tiramisu is also really good. I could do w/o their salads.. I have yet to try one that stands out.   And service is usually very good!"}
{"text":"I was surprised and delighted that Grimaldi's was so close to our hotel, The Trump. After our first night in Vegas, I woke up starving and frustrated, as our digs weren't super close to the strip and I wasn't trying to eat at the hotel in such a food-centered city. So after some quick Yelping, I found Grimaldi's, which I had previously heard about on some show on the Food Network, but didn't realize they had locations out West. We ordered a custom pizza and it came out solid, with crisp crust and just enough good quality, chewy mozzarella. Our salad was fresh, service professional, and the cheesecake was worth the calories. If you're looking for pizza and you're anywhere near Fashion Valley, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Pizza was great but service is terrible and management is a joke. Absolutely terrible experience."}
{"text":"It's really sad that this place has gone so down hill, the food is still decent I guess but everything else is pretty much garbage. It's even sad to see the manager in a green shirt and glasses is more worried about flirting and joking around than worrying about food getting ran or even a calzone or pizza getting cut correctly. I have been to the original in ny under the Brooklyn bridge and here since it opened and was just really let down. Restaurants always exist in a state of up and down, right now in my opinion they are down, seriously get sharper knifes at the tables too."}
{"text":"Best pizzeria in town. I've been here a couple times and never been disappointed. Their pizza is thin and crisp with the perfect amount of cheese and spices. You have the option to get a personal pizza or you can share a larger one. There are many topping choices at a reasonable price. The waiter will personally serve your first slice for you and offers crushed red pepper, parmesan, or oregano to top off your pizza."}
{"text":"Really good pizza! Very loud and crowded. Not a good place for a quiet romantic date. Salad and pizza are excellent. Service has always been nice!"}
{"text":"Better than most chain pizza. The ingredients are good and crust is good. We got a whiter with chicken and spinach and a red margarita.p. Both were above average, not cheap pizza. Place is fun for families Worth It  and won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While at Fashion Show Mall on a lunch date with my husband, we chose to dine at Grimaldi's over CPK. We ordered The Don pizza, and it was absolutely delicious. Additionally, Yadira was our server and she was so welcoming and attentive. When visiting Grimaldi's on S. Rainbow years ago, I remember they had no ranch dressing. I thought by now this would have changed but no bueno. This was actually why we were leaning more towards CPK, but decided to dine at Grimaldi's since it had been a while. As  a business decision, maybe this franchise would consider offering ranch since by now they have probably lost alot of revenue by not doing so. It was inconvenient to have to walk over to Johnny Rocket's for a side of ranch that so many like to eat with their pizza. Other than that, we had a great experience and we were highly satisfied with the pizza quality and service. Mr. Grimaldi, please introduce ranch dressing on your menu so we can visit you more often. I'm sure if you asked your employees how many customers ask for ranch, they will tell you a ton!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for 7pm. Pizza and salad. Got there at 650. Bartender didn't acknowledge me for 10 minutes. I got my food around 705 and the box was cold. Was very obvious the pizza was cold. Had to send it back. They rectified it but there are too many places to eat to justify coming back here."}
{"text":"The only edible pizza in Las Vegas.  I always mix the pesto sauce with the red sauce.  Also, eat in because the pizza cools very quickly.  I live around the corner and it's not good by the time I get home. Sometimes they serve my pizza cold, like it was sitting in the kitchen waiting for my server, but most of the time it's warm or hot.  Pretty pricey for pizza, but it's the best to choose from in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I got a free birthday pizza from them, so we tried Grimaldis for the first time. Our server was very friendly, and it is a very nice restaurant with a pleasant ambiance. The pizza was very, very good. Real New York-style thin crust. Our salad was not to our liking, but the overall experience and the pizza were great, and we will return."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza of life. That's it. If you want to eat real and good pizza just come here. I mean it's so simple yet so delicious! They have a way with each ingredient they use. First off the crust. It's thin and crisp but has a nice chew and good flavor. The cheese is fresh and milky. The pepperoni a are small but meaty and a little spicy. The meatballs are creamy with a subtle flavor. And the price!! The price is perfect. Not over or under priced. Seriously come here. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The pizza is exceptional here.  I had a chance to try the artichoke + chicken & pepperoni + sausage pizza, and both were exceptional (I'm not even a fan of pepperoni but they nailed it on this one).  The artichoke pizza is a must.  The prices are reasonable too.  Tips: -Open till 2AM. - You can order special sauce w/ your pizza but I wouldn't recommend it.  The sauce is a bit too sweet; it actually drowns out the flavor of your toppings and makes everything taste the same."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's pizza is solid.  There's quite a few of these locations in Vegas.  The food here is solid and comparable to the orginal location in NY which I've also had.  Antipasta - Appetizer - Average 3/5 -This wasn't that good.  Just cold cuts meats & veggies.  Don't order this.  The Don (Normal pizza, pepperoni, sausage, meatballs) - solid 4/5 -Solid.  I enjoyed the sauce and the meats.  Custom - White Garlic sauce, w/ Artichoke, Mushrooms, Chicken - solid 4/5 -The Garlic Sauce is solid.   Combined w/ the artichoke it's pretty tasty.  Chicken was a bit dry tho.  The Garden (Veggie Pizza) - Decent 3.5/5 The pizza was OK but it's just the other pizza's are 10x better.    TIPS -I recommend getting extra sauce"}
{"text":"When craving a pizza that is out of this world there is only one place in my book to visit and that is Grimaldi's. We have been to both the Old Town location and DC Ranch they are all fantastic.  Both places deliver on the pizza quality and the service has always been up to par, there is just nothing I would change so next time you are thinking about going out and getting a pizza then you must try Grimaldi's.....You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This is a no frills Italian restaurant that really has you smacking your lips!  Recommend the calzones.  Would have given four stars but the service was a little lacking."}
{"text":"BaaaaaM!! Upping to 5 stars. Sure, some of the best NY style pizza to be had anywhere, including NY where the original Grimaldis was born. But the service here is unparalleled, especially for a pizza joint. This time we had the immense pleasure of being helped by Joelle. She is definitely on it like Blue Bonnet. Patient in explaining the menu and pizza sauce variations etc. Also very efficient and fun loving too. I brought several family members here for my off to the airport meal, and we all had a blast with Joelle as our enabler. And this was on a random Monday lunch when you expect most restaurants to have their B team. I have a feeling they don't have a B team here.   Thanks again Grimaldis for another 5 star service experience."}
{"text":"This is pretty close to four stars. It's better than Spago, but I don't think it's 4. However, it's an absolute STEAL considering it's in Las Vegas. Three of their large pizzas, each with multiple toppings, only ran us about $70. That's crazy - it's a ton of food, fed 7 with some left over, and during the opening weekend of the NCAA tournament, it was a great way to lounge in the room and get fat while screaming at the television. Just too bad it's a bit of a walk from the Venetian and Venezia towers.  We had a pepperoni and mushroom, an Italian sausage and roasted red pepper, and a white pizza with pesto. All were good, with chewy crust and plentiful toppings. I liked their red sauce, and the white pizza was good, although heavy on the garlic. They did list garlic specifically, so I'm not blaming them, but it's not my thing, as you may or may not know.  So if you need a take out meal to eat in the room? This is great and almost thrifty option if you're staying in the Venetian/Palazzo."}
{"text":"A caesar salad and a veggie pizza did the trick for us. The pizza is probably different than what you are used to but I like a really thin crust. I think the trouble is they don't put enough sauce on it. That combined with a thin crust can make for a dry experience. it's on the spendy side of the pizza world that's for sure. I was coaxed into ordering a large by the server she said it's only two bucks more and you get 30% more pie. Well let's just say that is partially true."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on our most recent trip to Vegas. One word - delicious!  The dough is thin and crispy. The sauce was wonderful - tasted very fresh. They use fresh mozzarella on top of the pizza.  The pizza is reasonably priced. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive.  A great find! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place in The Venetian/Palazzo for some solid pizza. Having been to the OG Grimaldi's in Brooklyn a couple years ago, I have to say the Vegas location does a pretty good job at emulating some of NY's finest slices of pizza.   Our group of 6 came on a Saturday afternoon, and were seated right away. Damon was very friendly and suggested right off the bat that we get a small salad to share and The Don (the restaurant's must-have pizza). Damon says Grimaldi's LV is known for their salad and pizza, which they meticulously make to perfection. We ended up ordering a small spinach gorgonzola salad and large The Don and a large pizza with pesto, artichoke, and mushrooms on it. The salad was delicious and the small size was a perfect sample size for our group of 6. The pizzas came out in about 15-20 min. The Don impressed everyone, as the crust was baked to perfection and the toppings were amazing. I was so taken aback by the explosion of flavor in the italian sausage. I would put those bad boys in any Italian dish, whether it be pizza, pasta, or a sub, and call it a day. Our custom built pesto pizza was solid as well, but definitely not as memorable as The Don.  Overall, Grimaldi's LV on its own is a solid 4 star establishment. Of course, it doesn't compare to Brooklyn's flagship. But hey, at least you don't have to wait an hour in line just to get in in Vegas. Great food, great service, a bar and tv's, can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I really like this pizza joint. Great service and great pizza. I'll spare you the details, because Grimaldi's is reviewed to death, but this is one of my top spots in the whole valley.  http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/dining/articles/2009/08/18/20090818grimaldis.html  Cool article that goes to illustrate the lengths Grimaldi's goes to in order to make their pizza stand out from the pack."}
{"text":"Great spot.  The hostess was friendly and service was great.  We ordered a Caesar salad.  It was fresh, crisp and delicious.  We ordered 2 pizzas.  Both were delicious.  Crust was crispy, nice sauce and lots of toppings.  My kids were given pizza dough to play with and loved it."}
{"text":"We went to a Grimaldi's in Sparks, NV and loved it so when we saw this one in Scottsdale we were hoping that it was the same and it was!  Fantastic tasting sauce which makes every pizza so yummy! A small salad and personal pizza is plenty for two people. The servers were friendly too. Excellent place for large groups and the prices are very reasonable. Great find!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend, so I wanted to check it out.  First impression were not good since we had a table that didn't look clean.  It had pizza sauce on it.    We order the Kale Salad.  I can say, I not a big fan.  The sun dried tomatoes tastes like raisins.  The olive did add a very salty taste.  We had the garden pizza with sausage.  It was the worst pizza I have ever tastes.  Probably will not try this place again."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely amazed at how hard it is to find decent pizza in Arizona.  Why do most pizza slices have to be so thin????  This isn't just Grimaldi's, who have seem to perfected the art at making soggy extra thin pizza actually taste good, every place I've tried so far in Arizona can't seem to make pizza as well as anywhere else in the country!  Ugh.    Well despite it being a victim of feeding to the Arizonans who don't know what a good pizza tastes like, they were very efficient and friendly.  I give it four stars because it is an Arizona pizza joint, and no other pizza place in the state of Arizona knows how to make pizza.  I guess this is why Bianco's is so popular..."}
{"text":"This place is great. Old-school New Yorky decore and delicious pizza. Cool indoor/outdoor bar and seating.  The pizza is thin crust and not as cheesy or greasy as your typical pie. So, keep that in mind if that's what you like. In my opinion, this is just as tasty without being a gut-buster.  The menu is limited to pizza, calzones, apps/salads/sides, dessert and drinks so be prepared for that. As in, if you want pasta you're going to be disappointed as hell.  P.S. - Had the cheesecake the other day and it was money."}
{"text":"This place gets 5 star's just because the food was off the chains delicious.   Definitely one of the best slices on the west coast...Service was mediocre at best, not sure if our server was new or what. .nonetheless the quality of the pizza will make this a must visit whenever we're in town. . If you like beer you need to give the Broklyn lager a try..."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Saturday night. It was packed and the wait was about 45 minutes for a party of 6. We were seated outside and it was a warm night, so we didn't need heat lamps.  Once seated the service was sub par. For instance, our server took my tea for a refill and never brought it back. In addition, we ordered a bunch of personal pizzas and she said that their oven was small and suggested we get large pizzas half and half if we wanted our food in a reasonable time. We obliged and it still took over 30 minutes to get our food!Sounds like they need a bigger kitchen.  The pizza itself was decent, nothing special. We had some leftover and they wrapped it is tin foil and gave it to us, no box or anything! I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"Agh. Decent food. Salads are nothing to speak of. Service wasn't  that great when we went. The one in Fashion Show Mall is much better."}
{"text":"Ordered white pizza and a Mediterranean salad to share. The pizza was decent but definitely not the best white pizza that I've had. The salad was better than any other location I have been to.   The service was great. The reason for the three stars? We originally ordered water to drink. We had sat at the bar so it came out of the soda gun. I'm not sure if the lines are dirty or the gun itself needed to be cleaned but it was DISGUSTING. We both took one sip and I ordered Pellegrino right away. They might want to take a look at it. I live here. I drink the tap water here. This was something else."}
{"text":"Love this location ! Just celebrated my bday here last night. Chelsea the manager is a rockstar ! Her efficient, fun energy sets the pace for a great dining experience ! Will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"Delicious! The crust on the pizza is cooked to perfection of in the coal brick oven. I enjoyed sitting indoors to be able to watch the pizza making process. Great atmosphere and very reminiscent of NYC. I ordered a personal pizza with mushrooms. It was a bit overloaded with sauce but I think that's their style. I'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 430pm to be told they were cleaning their ovens and no pizza could be ordered.  WHY would a Pizzeria do this?! It wouldn't have been so bad if the host hadn't spoken to me so condescendingly.  Bummer, will update my rating if I ever give this place another try."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's last slice...4 people at the table...you ask yourself...do I really care about their friendship that much? would they get mad if I punch them ? Would it be too obvious if I accidentally lick it? did I brig my taser?? TOO LATE!! your 3 friends are already going \"sparta\" on each other for it. Yep..that good son..that good.  First lets start with the flavor. Le awesome. Mia mamma ..this pizza is packed of flavor. Delicious sauce, and toppings are generous  but not lacking of tastyness at all. Enough sauce to let you taste the other ingredients making it a whole different experience  The size..well..well..  if you are not that hungry you can use the x large pizza as a blanket, tent, parachute, or to cover a small garden. thing is massive. And its perfect for my appetite. even the \"small\" aint small. And the calzone you may ask? yes that one is the size of a whole island. Holy impressive sizes batman!  Now, if you (like me) have tried the grimaldins in NY , then you 'll say \"well its not the same\" DUH of course it isnt because all the other components that make food delicious (water, air, bacteria , etc) are not present as it is a different enviroment/city. However it is hands down the best pizza I tried in this desert.   to top this, there are days that they do 50 percent off bottles of wine (tuesdays I believe) . Get drunk get full get happy.. man I should be writing their slogan! . Be aware that they dont take reservations and this place can get packed  Hasta la pasta....(see what I did there?)"}
{"text":"Saleem and his trainee Alex so far has proven why Grimaldis is a must dine restaurant experience. Me and my wife got a pizza and appetizer. Both saleem and Alex knew what to recommend and it was amazing. They both put up a nice smile and very friendly attitude. I never had to ask to refill on water it is always topped off! Hands down the best experience please give saleem and Alex recognition as they deserve with the exceptional service they provided."}
{"text":"This is great pizza! The toppings are authentic and the crust is perfection.  Service is always A+  If you sign up online you'll receive a free large pizza  for your birthday!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, eveything tasted fresh and wood fired.  I will be back next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"In a city filled with name brand restaurants and chefs, the best food we had was also the cheapest - Grimaldi's. Excellent pizza, excellent service. Sometimes, chains are chains for a reason - because they've got something good and are smart enough to duplicate it over and over again."}
{"text":"Take out order took about 45 min for pick up which is fine for a Friday night, but when I got there the rest of the order (salad & desserts) weren't even ready. BUT! The salad and cheesecake was so bomb out of this word amazing it made up for the cold pizza.  Loving Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"As regular readers of my reviews both on here and my blog can tell you, there is nothing more that I hate than bad service.  Tonight, I visited this location as I have on many Mondays.  For the football season, they have had a 2 for 1 large 2 topping pizza special.  This is week 14 and I have been here for about half of the Mondays.  I have the same routine...we pick up our daughter from the bus stop and head to Grimaldi's.  Today, the server stated he did not know about the special and that he does not usually work on Monday.  I thought that was a bit strange, but just attributed that lack of knowledge about a special that has been in place for 3 1/2 months, was just poor communication.  He was friendly enough and said he would check with the manager.  No matter, I had called an hour before and made sure they were still running the special.  Soon a young blond woman approached the table and asked if we had a question.  We stated that we asked the server about the special and he didn't know about it.  She said that it was not available until 5:00.  I asked if we would be able to get it because we have many other times before and did not know about the time restriction.  She said that they should not have honored it in the past and did not offer to honor it this time.  It was 4:15 and we were told that it was going to be 30 minutes wait for them to stoke the oven, which we were willing to wait for.  We always order the same thing, a large salad, 2 large pizzas, 3 drinks and whatever cheesecake sounds good that day.  She was willing to let that business walk out the door, plus many other future visits over what...15 min?  It must be nice that business is so great that someone is willing to throw away business, not to mention tips for their servers.    I have been here at least 15-20 times and have sung their praises to many.  It ends now.  There are many other places to go.  Anyone need suggestions for other pizza joints, e-mail me."}
{"text":"The best pizza east of NJ. Fresh ingredients. Not greasy at all. The crust was very crispy. Delicious with a carafe of wine."}
{"text":"This is a cool pizza place.  In a great location and that's why we came here.   We ordered a Large Pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  It was covered with tons of cheese, and each slice was a tasty slab of thin crust goodness.  The Crust is not too much to brag about, the ingredients were decent but the house salad...umm much to say about it. because it was just that, bland.  Service was pretty good, our waitress handled the busy evening really well and she spoke about Grimaldi's like she knew her stuff.  I really liked the clear glass by the kitchen so you can watch them preparing an order.  There are quiet a few pizza places better than Grimaldi's but the atmosphere, service, and pizza are just fine.  We enjoyed our food and time here."}
{"text":"Came here for my big 21st birthday and I love it so much. We came on a Saturday so yes there was a wait time but when its busy and packed what do you expect? My girlfriend and I had 2 pizza's. The place is clean, and the music being played makes you feel like you're in Italy, and I had my first glass of red wine!!!! The pepperoni and the white large with mushrooms and grilled chicken. The only thing that ruined it was the lady sitting at a near table complaining that she waited so long to get her 15 top that she didn't call ahead and reserve for (yes I'm a waiter and host also)."}
{"text":"OH WHY, oh why, is SF pizza so crappy???   This place has 5+ branches in Vegas and none here. Sigh. While ridiculously overpriced and overhyped \"limited edition\" pizza dough thrives and sfists are ailing to spend $$$ on flour, yeast, and water... (you know what I'm referring to, don't even think that you don't, SF yelpers..) - this place is reasonably priced, friendly, and fun.   Upon a local's recommendation we ended up here well beyond the strip, and wow, parking right up front on a Monday night! Yay.   Thin crust w sweet and basil-y tomato sauce, we opted for ricotta, garlic and mushrooms. Insanely reasonably priced considering the size of the pie!  The waitstaff were friendly and one of the staff even let me borrow her lighter to light the bday candle since there were no matches to be found in the restaurant!!!    It was a small birthday celebration so we also shared a plate of mini cannoli. Yum. Perfectly sized for our already full tummies!   Please open one in SF, or even Berkeley, for that matter."}
{"text":"I went to Grimaldis again tonight to celebrate a 50th anniversary...the pizza is AMAZING...it's absolutely the best pizza I've ever eaten anywhere ever...New York brick oven just changes it all and the quality of the ingredients never disappoint. The Caprese salad is also delicious...GRIMALDIS Peoria Arizona has NEVER disappointed! Oh, and they feature local craft beers in season...the watermelon brew I had was Crazy good!"}
{"text":"We met up with friends that said \"You HAVE to try this place...you HAVE to try this place...you HAVE to try this place!\"  So we tried it, and it was just okay.  Service was great and the staff was very professional.  No high school kids here.  They know when to show and they know when to leave and they deal well with crowds and pressure.  Pizza, however, was nothing special. Coal-fired or not, it was just pizza.  I repeat.  NOTHING SPECIAL.  Not worth waiting 40 minutes to be seated for.  I like Barro's better.  House wine was cheap, though.  That's worth at least one more star."}
{"text":"It's really 4.5 stars, but I'll bump up a half for a couple of outstanding things.  Get to that later.  In the end, Grimaldi's is a legit pizzeria that does everything right.  Great atmosphere for a pizza joint, great service all-around (although it can sometimes be a bit slow), and the best made pizza I've yet found.    So let me explain the \"best made\" part a bit.  I can't quite say Grimaldi's pizzas are the best TASTING pizza I've had, although it is among them.  By \"best made\", I am talking about the parts that made the whole.  - Fresh toppings, including things like real basil leaves, real chopped garlic, etc. - Sauce that's not too much, not too little - (Outstanding #1) Real, white, sliced (not cut into little pieces) mozzarella cheese that eliminates much of the grease that you find at the typical NY pizza place (even in NYC) - (Outstanding #2) Perfectly made crust that is slightly crispy outside, perfectly chewy without being overly firm inside, and not too bready  From ingredients and execution standpoint this really is a 5-star pizza.  The sum of all it's parts, however, may fall a bit shy of that since I can't bring myself to truly give it a full 5-star taste.  No matter, it's still close to it.  Plus, their Caprese salad is the bomb!  Fresh tomatoes and thick mozzarella chunks, bedded by giant, whole leaves of basil.  Nyam, nyam, nyam!  Where do they get those giant basil leaves??  And then top it all off with a glass of Peroni.  In my 4 visits to Grimaldi's I've never been disappointed.  The only thing left to try is their calzone which, by the taste of their pizza crust, should be outstanding.  Table-for-1 Factor:  I typically see most pizza joints as ideal solo dining spots.  Grimaldi's may not exactly fit that bill, but they do have bar area where you can sit and nosh on your own.  I don't see why not."}
{"text":"I've been spoiled by the Brooklyn location. About a year ago, we made the walk across the Bridge from Manhattan over to Brooklyn and found ourselves waiting in line at Grimaldi's. When we finally started eating, the pizza was properly seasoned, and the crust actually had that charred and burnt flavor that made the place so famous.  When I heard that there were Grimaldi \"chains\" all over the place, I was immediately intrigued. The closest one was in Las Vegas. So on the next trip, we decided to check it out for lunch. It was about a 10 minute drive from the Strip, closer to Henderson. We found ourselves at some strip mall, which reminded me of Irvine.  When we settled in and stopped looking at all the black & white \"faux\" Brooklyn framed photos all over the walls, we decided on sharing a large pizza, half with sun dried tomatoes and mushrooms, and the other half with pepperoni. We also shared an antipasto salad, which was pretty good. Fresh slices of mozzarella, salami, salted olives, along with some toasted bread. It was nice way to start off the meal.  Unfortunately, the pizza was a bit of disappointment. Naturally, I had high expectations, having been to the Brooklyn location. The pizza overall tasted a bit bland, like it needed more seasoning in the crust. The crust didn't have that burnt-coal flavor either. But if you think about it, how could it? I was comparing it to the Brooklyn location, which the ovens have been burning since 1905. It makes a huge difference.  I even asked our waitress if it was true that they ship in water from NY. She flat out said no, but they do have a water filtration system using \"osmosis\" which replicates the NY water. Interesting, to say the least. I wouldn't say it made much of a difference anyway. Overall, it's still good pizza that I would rather have than something from Costco or Dominos or Pizza Hut. Prices are pretty high, however, but good for the occasional splurge. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is good when you're sober and AMAZING when you're drunk! A must try if you're staying at The Palazzo or The Venetian."}
{"text":"Yummy Caesar salad ! Place was packed. Our food took about 40 minutes to be put out. Prices affordable and meal is worth it."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's offers the charm of neighborhood dining. The staff is always welcoming, friendly and accommodating. Chilled Panna water and Manhattans with several maraschino cherries set the table. Dean Martin croons in the background.   I appreciate the access to indoor and outdoor seating. Indoors, the children enjoy watching pizza preparation as they peer through a window overlooking the chefs' kitchen. Outdoors, I don't fret about an accidentally spilled drink and mounds of fallen crumbs. Rather, our focus is on the breeze, a fountain, and at times live music (for example from a nearby restaurant on Cinco de Mayo).  Grimaldi's is prompt to provide crayon packs and kid fun activity menus. Another kid-friendly aspect is the mound of fresh, pliable pizza dough presented on a silver pizza tray to each child. This hands-on activity keeps everyone entertained.  The gluten-free pizza menu is a build your own product. I prefer the GF basil pesto pizza for $16, I too it with red onions and artichoke hearts. The fresh, crunchy Kale Chopped Salad I opt to omit the shaved parmesan ( although the salty taste adds flavor and gritty texture to those who can eat dairy). The Greek olives, sweet red onions, lemons are a blend of refreshing and tangy flavors. Check out the seasonal menu. We ordered an 18\" pizza with chicken BBQ.  Be patient with finding a parking spot. Valet is also an option.  Sorry i missed the photo opportunities to share. Life gets busy with kids."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I've ever tried. Absolutely amazing. Can't wait for the next Vegas trip when I can eat at this place again!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, white chicken and sliced tomatoes was great."}
{"text":"The pizza is mouth watering and  refreshing.  The service is 5 star and if it isn't right, they make it right and you are very pleased with your experience when you walk out the door."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to eat in Vegas for the price. The pizza is so good, the service is always amazing. They cater to large parties. I cant say enough. Every time we go to Vegas this is a must have. My entire family loves this place and everyone we have recommended to go here. Never a bad time, always THE BEST!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! 5stars for their pizzas.  3 star service.  Slow and forgettful...I don't think its the waiters fault...looked like they were understaffed today. Maybe bc od holiday season.  We got the white garlic 16''pizza with pepperoni,  italian sausage,  basil, tomatoes.  I shared with my husband...we both loved it and its plenty for two people to share.  Mediterranean salad was great too."}
{"text":"It's a small restaurant with a lot of style and character, but it looks out of place tucked into the stark white Fashion Show mall. I was with my parents and brothers, we decided pizza sounded good. The hostess sat us without a smile. We asked what beers that had on draught and without even answering she just pointed at the black book in the middle of the table that listed beers and specials and walked away.  We looked over the menu (our first time to Grimaldi's) and discovered that there's only pizza and salads. For a large pizza with no toppings it starts at $16, each topping is $2+. More expensive than I had anticipated, especially with picky little boys. We started discussing going somewhere more kid-friendly for my brothers. The server came up and you could see the disappointment of ending up with a family at her table. Fashion Show caters to tourists and people willing to drop a lot of dough, so she probably sized us up as cheap and not good tippers.  No smile. No greeting. We gave our drink orders at first, but her attitude really killed any desire for me to be there. I am a FOOD & BEVERAGE SUPERVISOR, all I deal with is customer service all day long. Her obvious disdain made me get up and ask her to cancel our drinks. She said, \"Oh.\" in the most lackluster way possible and walked away from us. That's it! I was personally insulted. I'm sorry my family didn't measure up to your expectations, but we were ready and willing to eat, drink, and tip well. Grimaldi's will not get my business again, not for high prices and poor service."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Fresh cheese!!!- Authentic.   The service was fast. The pizza couldn't have been anymore perfect. Real slices of fresh mozzarella cheese. Create your own pizza with so many toppings. The meatballs were the best."}
{"text":"The service was subpar. Splitting a check seemed to confusing for them. Pizza took a while to get ready.  Note: although on the menu it says 16 dollars per pizza it's EXCLUDING toppings. Toppings are minimum 2 dollars each. So the price spikes pretty fast. On the other hand a large pizza is enough to fill four people.   Some argue that this is the best pizza they've ever had. I'd vehemently disagree. They clearly need to step out of Italian restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's with a big group from work and everyone enjoyed the experience! We ended up ordering 3-4 pizzas and ended up with something everyone liked. The set up is ideal for big groups and we were able to score a table outside on the patio that worked out really well. Great wine and beer selection and there are a number of TVs for the avid sports fan. Grimaldi's is also not too expensive and definitely worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Fast, friendly service. Definitely a return spot for whenever I'm in the area. Being in a position to possibly relocate here it's places like this that make the decision a little easier."}
{"text":"I'm dropping five stars for Grimaldi's for the total experience. Not only is the pizza delicious, but the decor is fresh and modern with a warm and inviting feel. The kitchen is open air at one end of the main room, with plenty of seating, and a good sized full bar at the other end. The service is quick, with very friendly and accommodating staff. Now to the food and drink. I had the Santan Brew Devil's Ale because they were out of the IPA, but I was pleased to find that the Devil was still hoppy and a good pairing with pizza... flavorful but not too strong. The pizza... man oh man the pizza. Definitely the best thin crust I've ever had. The cooking technique gives it a very nice crispy outside but soft inside. The cheese is always fresh mozzarella and both the traditional red sauce and white garlic are great. All the ingredients are fresh and tasty and worth the money. My last visit left me wanting more sausage but that's a small discrepancy in a solid track record. At the very least give it a try and if it falls short it's all good... it's just pizza people.  Oh almost forgot, the Canoli are awesome! Maybe slightly overpriced for the size, but well made and decadent."}
{"text":"It was sunday and the husband wanted a pizza for the games. I guess I'm picky on my pizza because I am from NY...blah blah blah... you've heard the rant. Anyway, Girmaldi's is close by and I figured hey I remember the pizza's not being half bad I'll pick one up to go. First I had no idea if they did pizza to go, idk why I thought that I guess because I've always eaten there.   I called and said can I ask a silly question? Do you have pizza's togo? I felt so dumb, but the girl on the other line snickered  and said of course we do I get asked that a lot. I'm sure she was just trying to make me feel better. I ordered sausage, onion, mushroom, and peppers (my favorite combo). She said it would be 20 mins, I don't remember the exact total but I know it was under $25, not bad IMO.   I got it home and it was good it didn't get soggy or anything like I feared. My husband doesn't always want pizza but when he does now I have a go to place. Now if only they had wings! =D"}
{"text":"Pretty bland pizza. I ordered the 12 inch with mushroom. I had to add so much red pepper flakes to give it some taste, I'm shocked my mouth isn't on fire. Service?  What service. I should have went to Oregano's"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but the service tonight was not so great. Didn't even get someone to refill after 30min until they heard the last slurp of soda. First time here and even though food was good won't come back due to service."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good and the atmosphere was great for a casual dinner. The ingredients tasted really fresh and the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Last night we were \"those people\", walking in 30 minutes before they closed. Our waiter was very prompt and didn't act like us coming in so late was an issue at all. We ordered at large pizza with Roma tomatoes, garlic and spicy chicken sausage. It was so good! The pizza was perfectly cooked and the spicy chicken sausage had an amazing flavor to it. We ordered, ate and drank in about 20 minutes being courteous to them closing and had a great experience. I would go back for sure. It's a little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"So, We, as in my family of boys and I, really loved this place and enjoyed our dinner last night!  My oldest wanted pizza for dinner, I told my Husband the idea and he had heard of this place from a friend of ours who takes his family all the time. So that said a lot knowing the kind of nice places he enjoys going to.   We had high expectations because of the friend who referred us to check Grimaldi's on Northern out.  I liked that we were able to add ourselves to the wait list from the Yelp app, it even gave us a timeframe and sent me a text right after thanking us and asking that we check in upon arrival.  We got there and checked in, waited about 10 min for a table. They were busy (Friday night), Lots of big groups that night, some birthdays etc. Once we were seated our waitress was super nice and got us all drinks right away. Our boys, 4, 3 & 1 year olds loved getting the pizza dough to play with. Edible fun!  My husband ordered an IPA, and then had a Peroni, and I had a glass of their wine they created that pairs well with The Don pizza. Very good! This style of pizza is wood fired, definitely not your basic chain pizzas, more of an artisan kind of pizza. Crust is crispy, their sauce has great flavor, apparently they're known for their famous sauce.  Our boys ate nearly all of their cheese pizza, we ate all of The Don, well, I had two slices, my hubby ate the rest. That's a good sign. :) I also ordered the Ceasar salad, the small is big. Enough to share with 2-3 people.  We got some desserts to go, tiramisu, a couple canolis and a chocolate cheesecake. The family loved all the desserts. I'd say the tiramisu is one of the best I've had. Yum!  Overall, we loved this place, food was great, drinks were quick, filled and good, the atmosphere was relaxed and laid back but definitely had a nice family & enjoy yourself sort of feel with some big groups and college football playing on the tv's near the bar.  I think we've found a nice new spot for the fam. I'd also like to go back with just the Husband for a fun dinner at the bar. If you come here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is located in the middle of a mall, next to the Santa lane. I was having such a hard time giving them five stars! For the following reasons: #1: my husband and I went in and had to wait 8 minutes until we got seated. Cause the hostess wasn't around to seat us, while the other servers just kept passing by us & ignored us or even bothered asking us to be seated.  #2: the hostess decided to seat us next to the loudest area next to the kitchen, where all the noises the blaring, while there was another four top that was clear and empty, next to the entrance, with less noise. Later be known, she sat that table with 2 people at that 4 top. Hmmm how's that for my four stars?  Now let me get to the third and bold one... #3: their food is good, they missed a tiny portion of our order, but aside to that, our waitress decided to rush us while we're still eating and gave us our check by saying \"NO RUSH\" and even offered us to box my pizza to go, WHILE I was still eating. Is that even common??? Talk about being \"NO RUSH!!!\" What a fucking joke! #4: Well, I ended up eating one more slice, and husband paid the bill, and as we walked out, we discovered there was a bit of a line! Know what? If that was the case, they should've been a lot better in managing time, tables and food prep! Had they NOT made the mistake on my pizza, I would've gotten my meal done earlier than expected.  Food was good, service wasn't what I had expected! #crappyservice #failedservice #restaurantfailed"}
{"text":"How did this place get a 4 star rating?   We ordered a large pizza w/ pepperoni and mushrooms for pick up since we were too lazy to go to a restaurant. Upon first glance, the pizza looked extremely soggy for something that just came out of the oven a few minutes before. The smell of the pizza was very off putting as the cheese had a strange bitter aftertaste. The pepperoni looked and tasted like frozen pizza quality. I could barely muster in two slices before I called it quits. Everything just tasted like a mushy, soggy mess and almost uneatable. Pizza Hut would've been so much better...  This is NY style pizza gone wrong. Way wrong.   +1 for being located right downstairs from my hotel room"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and the pie here in Scottsdale comes pretty close to the quality I got back East.  The crust was perfectly thin and flavorful, not bland.  The sauce was fresh and sweet, but not too sweet.  The cheese was great as well. We had pepperoni, mushroom and onion (my go-to, baseline combo) and so far this is the best pizza I've eaten in the Valley (just got here in January, though, so I'm looking for more contenders!)."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza place! This is one of my boyfriends favorite places in Vegas and the reputation he set up for it was true. Great atmosphere (loved the hanging lights), good service, and the food I have tried there is all high quality. Recommend their meatball pizza, calzones, and house wine."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Reminds me a lot of ny pizza.  This is easily one of my favorite pizzerias in town.  The other place I usually go to is Metro Pizza on horizon ridge.  They offer the usual salads, cal-zones, pizzas.  I usually order one of their specialty pies.  The pizzas itself are a little pricy, but nothing too ridiculous."}
{"text":"Is this exactly what New York pizza is like? It's sort of close, but not exactly. Apparently, the secret to true NY pizza is in the water. Being that it's 2000 miles away, I don't expect them to import that here. However, this is still pretty good pizza. Been here twice, with the last one being a birthday offer for a free large pizza. All you have to do is sign up for their email subscription!   Anyway, the first time I was there, I ordered the pesto pizza with spinach and spicy chicken sausage and a NY style cheesecake. Pizza was cooked evenly, crust had a nice crispness to it, and it wasn't overly greased like you see with other pizza places. The spicy chicken sausage definitely had a nice kick to it! Cheesecake was pretty good too. Second time around, I had the regular pizza with sausage, peppers, and mushrooms. Again, this pizza was solid. Although you could tell it wasn't truly from New York, it's close enough that if I was in the mood for NY pizza, it would definitely do its job.  In most instances, I would give this place 4 stars, so why am I adding the 5th? They messed up my order and actually made the same pie twice. Instead of throwing it out, they actually gave it to me for free. SCORE! Free pizza that would probably last me 2 or 3 meals! Service was outstanding both times. Servers were very friendly, attentive, and outgoing. Ambience was very New York-ish too. Lots of pictures of NY on the walls with Frank Sinatra playing in the background."}
{"text":"If you are in a hurry, go somewhere else. I definitely understand that things get busy, and we got there right before the dinner rush. However, our pizza came out and the next one that was ordered in our group didn't come out until we were finished with our pizza. They also got the size of our pizza wrong, and told us they were adding a personal size to our order to make up for it.  THAT pizza didn't come out until the others in our group were done with THEIR pizza. Really unorganized, but they were very apologetic and offered free dessert.   Pizza was pretty good though- fresh mozzarella and their tomato sauce was yummy.   Also- no wifi available. They had it, but it was locked and only for their use. Seriously, it's nearly 2011. In the age of Yelp, and checking in via Foursquare and Facebook, it's just bad business to not have wifi available for your patrons. Even if you keep it locked but give a code so you're not sharing with the entire outside world.   I would go back, but it wouldn't be a first choice if I'm wanting pizza."}
{"text":"This time we brought 2 of our friends who have never been to Grimaldi's and they loved it! I had the Odell Amber that was on tap and it was delicious. Large Pepperoni, large Brooklyn, a large spinach salad and caprese salad with Salami was shared among the 4 of us. We ate everything except two pieces of pizza! See you next time Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"Best pizza!  We make our own: meatball, spinach, ricotta, and tomatoes!  Yummy!  The kids love it because they get their own dough and make pretend pizzas.  They have a great patio when the weather permits.  This is a staple in Henderson!"}
{"text":"Had such a pleasant experience at this Grimaldi's. My aunt and I were seated immediately and our waitress was such a doll, very attentive.   The pizza itself took a lot longer than it should have to come, i understand theyre busy but it was just out of my range of patience lol. It was also mediocre, not blown-away type of pizza.  This is a good restaurant to go to when you just cant pick where to go and can settle for less."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza fanatic and expert. I make my own homemade pizza from scratch.  This is New York thin crust at its finest. I love Johns in New York but I have to say this is better!  Come one come all."}
{"text":"Came in, sat down...lovely.  No happy hour...got up and left:)"}
{"text":"This is the place my son chose for his birthday dinner. We've been here before so knew what to expect. It was pretty packed on a Tuesday evening but we were seated right away. They have patio seating but we decided to sit inside. There was other tables celebrating birthdays as well, so understandably the noise level was high but tolerable.  We ordered a small kale salad. Small feeds about 2 people while large feeds about 4. Salad was fresh and had really good flavor. Loved that they added sun dried tomatoes and black olives with cucumbers. Very refreshing. We also ordered large margarita pizza and added few extra toppings. I believe it was $2 extra for each topping which was reasonable. I have to say, they have the best pizza crust. I usually don't eat pizza crust but I couldn't help eating everything here. Also, this is one of very few places where pizza isn't overly salty.  My son also wanted to try out the calzone and decided to get the personal size one. Don't let the name fool you. The personal size is big enough to feed two people. Needless to say, we had leftovers.  I always thought calzone was just pizza folded in half, but I was proven wrong. The crust tasted soft and chewy in the middle while it had a nice crunch on the outside. The filling was very moist and creamy from mozzarella and ricotta cheese. It was very good; I highly recommend it. Our waiter, Alex was amazing. He somehow always appeared when we needed something.  Overall, it was perfect birthday dinner for my son. We'll be back very soon."}
{"text":"Great crust with a sassy chewy center.  The coal fired oven definitely helps the flavor.  They coal flavor is subtle, which is better than other coal places that I have been to.  They are so hardcore that they have a special water filtration system that mimics the water profile from New York City.  Great service from our bartender / server Shombi.  Fast service with a warm smile"}
{"text":"Thank you for a great dining experience.  The crust was delicious and really makes the pizza stand out.  I look forward to the next visit here."}
{"text":"Good New York style thin crust pizza. They have really expanded in the last few years. Up to about 35 stores. Good pizza especially for Arizona."}
{"text":"Nom-nom-nom... Soooo good!   The ricotta cheese option makes this particular pizza stand out from others. They give the kids some dough to play with to pass the time, and there's an observation window in the back for them to watch the pizzas being made. Score!  The decor is pretty cool with wine bottles for pendant lights at the bar area and hanging from the ceilings. It's a very \"New York\" vibe with old signage from the original grimaldis.   I love eating outside, so it's a big draw to me when restaurants have that as an option.   I was not a fan, however, of their calzones. It was a huge crust filled mostly with air, and then some sauce and meet sat sadly at the bottom, like the last bit of water in the tub that didn't make it down yet. Oh well, just not for me."}
{"text":"I can't.  I've been here three times now and each pizza I had was not good.  This time around was such a disappointment, I had to yelp.    First off, the prices here are beyond ridiculous and I cannot justify the price because the pizzas are far from being tasty.  The menu is \"build your own\" and comes in three sizes- 12, 16, and 18 inches, and priced based on that along wit the bread/sauce (few bucks more if you opt for pesto or white pizza, etc.).  Then you tack on an extra $2-$4 for each additional topping you want.  Now that's a bit excessive to me, but I'll fork out the cash if the food is worth it.  I ordered a 16inch pizza topped with pesto, ricotta, anchovies, sun dried tomatoes, and jalapeño on 1/2 of the pizza.  The pizza came out sooooooo dry!  Barely any sauce, and the cheese they topped it off with (buffalo) was so hard and rubbery, it was inedible.  The anchovies had such an over powering taste of salt- had to pick them off.  I was expecting the ones soaked in vinegar, thinking it'd add a nice tangy taste.  The jalapeños were sliced so thick I had to pick those off too.  I love jalapeños on my pizza, but they've got to be sliced nice and thin in order for it to be good.  The waiter forgot to add the ricotta cheese so that was kinda lame.  The check came out to $30 for one pizza.  Such a waste of money.  Forced myself to eat it, but basically threw $4 worth of toppings out the window cause I picked them off my pizza.  Moreover, I had jalapeños put on 1/2 the pizza.  Why didn't I get charged 1/2 the price? Haha.  I'm open to ALL TYPES OF PIZZA: thin crust, thick crust, stuffed crust, deep dish, etc. etc., the pizza they serve here is thin crust, little sauce, extra dry, with sporadic pieces of rubbery cheese placed throughout.  The very basic foundation of a pizza does not meet my expectations here so I won't be back, there are other pizza places in LV I'd rather spend my money at."}
{"text":"We have had several great experiences here with Ashley a our server!  She is delightful and fun on top of having amazing wine (for my wife), amazing pizza!!!  Thanks for a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Pure unaltered, delicate, deliciousness.  I am a fan of this and wish I would come back more frequently. It is a create your own style and you are charged for each topping, so this could get a little pricey, but it is well worth it, more than you know!!   My favorites:  Caprese salad: perfect and simple. This restaurant does not try to reinvent the wheel on this dish.  Pizza: The standard thin crust that is perfectly baked in their coal ovens... get a piece with a pizza bubble on it!! I love the just-charred bits on here..  I usually get pesto with chicken. So light and flavorful. Its a carnival for your tastebuds, and texturebuds!  Dessert: Cheesecake and cannolis  I don't want to write too much on these dishes because they are what we have all had before, but Grimaldi's keeps it simple which makes there food SO GOOD. I am not an advocate for the \"true NY style pizza,\" and frankly, I don't believe in it, but this is the besssstt pizza:]"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is my favorite pizza, there's something about the crust and slight smokiness that make it special. I also love the pepperoni, it seems like it slightly thicker cut and that makes for a much meatier flavor. The lack of ranch doesn't bother me because the pizza itself has so much flavor."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go!  Typically lunch on a weekend, though I've been for some dinners too.  Pizza options are awesome, anything you could imagine.  Drinks from the bar are good and fast too.  Rarely have to wait at lunch, unless I want a specific table.  Service is friendly, fast, and competent.  Almost anything we've wanted special has been accommodated.  Salads are good too.  Pizza thin crust, baked hot and crispy.  I'll keep going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Fresh quality ingredients make all the difference.  My wife had a calzone with fresh mozzarella (not the shredded stuff) and pepperoni.  That mozzarella was the bomb!  The red sauce on the side was delicious too.  I had the Quattro Formaggi (four cheese, for you non-Italians) and it was amazing. I liked that it was just the cheese and was not diluted with any sauce.  It allowed the flavors of the cheese to blend together wonderfully.  I had a blackberry gimlet and my wife had a Limoncello Long Island Martini, both of which were very good. My gimlet has a nice smooth texture and her martini tasted just like a lemon drop.  I took away a star because I'm kinda cheep and didn't like that two drinks and two meals was $53 before tip, but that's the price you pay for quality.  Otherwise, this was a great choice for date night."}
{"text":"Their server was extremely rude and short with me when I came to pick up a to go order and the service took over an hour."}
{"text":"Great pizza with a fantastic desert and great service. My stomach couldn't be more happy. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to stop by for some quality food in Vegas. You have to get dessert or you are wrong."}
{"text":"good pizza, design your own, nice courtyard, helpful staff, good price  whats not to love ?"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  After doing some light shopping in the Park West area, my friend and I stopped into Grimaldi's Pizzeria for a quick bite.  The coal-brick oven was a pretty enticing feature and my friend and I ordered two personal pizzas.  The crust was thin, crispy, and had a good amount of char.  The tomato sauce also had decent flavor.  What I didn't enjoy was paying for each topping I wanted.  It can go from a $10 pizza up to a $20 pizza easily... and this is for a small 12\" pie!  We passed up on dessert and just headed over to the chocolate shop across the way.   Grimaldi's is a cute little restaurant with lots to offer.  It's a tasty pie but for the price, I rather eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Initial thoughts:   I was first told about this coal brick-oven pizzeria by a friend of mines. I do have the say the moment you walk into this restaurant it has a warm atmosphere. I was initially greeted by the hostess and brought over to a table. It had a large coal brick oven and they do change out the coals depending on the serving time between lunch and dinner. I made the mistake of going at around 4pm when they were switching the coals out. It has a nice bar that opens out to a patio area that is open during the warmer season. It has a good location but I had trouble finding it at first. I couldn't see a sign for it until I passed it.  Food:  I really really enjoyed their pizza. Whenever I go, I always get the meatball topping and it is superb. They take the homemade meatballs and slice them thin and place them as toppings. The crust is nice and thin and the freshness of their ingredients from the fresh mozzarella and their basil. The sauce is quite flavorful and tasty. I was talking to one of their managers and I explained this was my first time dining and he told me a little bit about where they come from. He explained to me that they balance their ph of the water to match it just like NYC. I was really impressed that they did that, as it shows a dedication to great pizza. They also serve white pizza if that is something you enjoy.   Service:  The waitress was very efficient. She took my drink order and asked if it was my first time dining. I can't remember her name but she was very friendly and knew the menu very well. I ordered my personal pizza and it only seemed like a couple of minutes and it came out warm, fresh and toasty. She did a wonderful job on asking about my food and making sure my drink was always full. Kudos to her.   Quality:  Fresh, fresh, and fresh. Their ingredients are not skimped on and you can taste the freshness in their produce and sauces. I don't think you will be disappointed.   Final thoughts:  Grimaldi's is definitely my choice for a sit down pizza joint. The freshness of their ingredients their warm and welcoming staff and their dedication to great pizza shows that their restaurant will be and continue to be successful and their patrons will spread the word and continue to come back. They obviously know what needs to be done to run a great restaurant. I know I will be coming back and I will bring my friends along as well."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Grimaldi's.  We came here for a work function, with lots of nibbles for all of course.  I'm normally not a thin pizza girl, but that's the only kind they'd gotten for the event.  It was actually pretty good.  Good enough I might think about ordering it if/when I go there again.  If it were more in the neighborhood for me I know I'd have made it back there by now!    The setting is casual, but nice enough you could bring a casual date here.  And unlike so many things on Scottsdale road, it's not overly pretentious and it's easy to find.  And the prices aren't over the top either.  We were there for happy hour/early dinner time on a Friday and there were TONS of available tables.  I'm shocked that this place isn't packed every night."}
{"text":"When I want pizza in the valley, this is what I want. The pepperoni at Grimaldi's is amazing. And I'm normally not a fan of it. Why white pizzas are great. Combine the two and I'm going to need to haul my butt to the gym because I'm downing half a pizza.  They have a decent selection of beer and wine. Maybe not as good as some places but not bad. And the seasonal cheesecakes are great. Assuming that were are ordering less than 1 pizza for every other person, then I usually have room for the cheesecake and never regret it. If you do overdo it at dinner... just do some jumping jacks and pack it down!  The staff is friendly and I've only ever had 1 issue with anyone here. Also don't forget to sign up on their website for a free pizza on your birthday."}
{"text":"First they were very busy,  but that doesn't excuse poor service.  Our waiter was also the Bartender.  He took great care of the people at the bar but continued to forgery about us.  Only refilled our drinks once after we finally got his attention after 20 minutes.  He walked past us multiple times workout even glancing at us. Then or order was wrong which they did correct the pizza without us mentioning it and the salad was corrected after my wife brought it to the attention of the manager who waited on us more than our actual waiter. Different might have been better experience.  The food did taste good.  Call me old fashion but if I am spending $70 plus on a meal,  I expect good service. I would not go back just because of the service."}
{"text":"After sobbing over the recently closed Ciao Ciao's, I was in need of another good pizza place. My friends suggested Grimaldi's, saying it might even beat my former pizza love, so I was game.   I wouldn't go as far as saying it beat Ciao Ciao's, but it was definitely good and we will be back.   We took our 15 mo. old with us for an early Sunday dinner. It was great to see so many other kids there and they even offer \"kid dough\"-- pizza dough for the them to play with at the table. We got a large pizza, half cheese and half pepperoni... the pizza was great. Awesome crust, delicious sauce and cheese... the only thing I will not be getting again was the pepperoni. It was the small slices like you'd find on a Red Barron frozen pizza and the flavor wasn't great. We picked it off and still managed to finish the whole pizza.   We will definitely be returning. Great family place. Quick service. Yummy food. You can't beat it! (Although, I will say... I still miss Ciao Ciao's.)"}
{"text":"After our favorite Pizza place closed, we are once again in search of the best pizza in Las Vegas.  Grimaldi's was recommended to us.   We ordered a medium barbecue chicken pizza and a medium pepperoni and red peppers!  Wow!  They are quite pricey for pizza.  The barbecue chicken was $23.00!  It was flavored okay, not much sauce and the chicken was mushy.  Toppings are $2-4 each.  Red peppers were $4.  The pepperoni pizza had nice flavor, but again sauce was sparse,  Restaurant was bright with a nice bar, but pizza was lackluster.   Service was mediocre.   We probably won't return at these prices, unless we are offered a deep discount.  bill was $54. For 2 medium pizzas, 1 soft drink and 1 beer. Disappointed....the search continues!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a looong time. Reminds me of the pizza I had in Italy. I've been craving it every day since. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Interesting service. Not sure if it is bad or just the staff. But the pizza is very good.  Sit at the bar for better service."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and service. It's a unique pizza coal ovens with unique taste. The ingredients are top class so are there pizzas. If you have time this is definitely a place you need to try."}
{"text":"Me and a friend stopped at this location for a Friday lunch after going to the movies.   The staff was friendly and not intrusive. The waitress did a good job of replenishing my soda.  As for the food: I couldn't even tell I was eating a sausage calzone. Very light on the toppings. My friend's calzone had to be returned to the kitchen for reheating; the middle was cold. Unfortunately there really wasn't anything that made the food stand out.   Desserts were okay too. We both had cheesecake and it was no different than cheesecake from a supplier that any restaurant would serve.   Comparing the price with the food quality and uniqueness, I'm not sure if I would return here."}
{"text":"This place is really good. One the pizza flavor is way different than any pizza in Vegas, also they have amazing desert. Their cheesecake is delicious. I went here with my friend for wine and the bartender, was so nice and amazing! Great piz"}
{"text":"This place is very good best pizza I've had in a long time crispy crust and quality ingredients very good"}
{"text":"The pizza here has been consistently good. Two people can split a small pizza which is 16\". Their regular pepperoni pizza is a 5/5 for great flavor and crispy thin crust. We have preferred takeout from Grimaldis over delivery. As for the price, very reasonable for the quality that is served.  Sign up for the free birthday pizza!!"}
{"text":"The only thing that saved our first visit here was the food. That was great. Service sucked from the moment we walked through the door. Empty tables, but a 20 min wait? Hostess was the rudest human being I have ever encountered in a restaurant. We were placed in the corner and ignored all through our service. Took 30 minutes for is to get boxed up and wait for our card to be ran to get out. Bad first impression."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza online and the confirmation email told me it would be done at a certain time, i went in and told host i was there for a pickup and she passed me along to the back of the building. I stood by the kitchen for 20 min and not one person approached me so i thought I'd look at to go tickets to see if my name and order was there, well it wasn't so i walked back to host to talk and she was no where to be found for 10 more min. I left with no pizza and wasted an hour of my time. They need a better pick up system in place. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   Furio isn't open for lunch. Neither is Bandera. So, we ended up here. It's a decent option for the area, especially when it's lunch out with co-workers. Provided you can all agree on what pizza to order.   We shared a caprese salad. I thought the mozzarella was a little on the dry side. It was an okay salad.   The pizza was good, though it seemed lukewarm when it was served. Like once it left the wonderful coal brick oven, it sat in the open for a little too long. For the lunch crowd on a workday, the pizzas weren't served fast enough, in my opinion. Don't go here if you have limited time!   All in all, a good choice. I, of course, recommend the pesto-style pizza. Adding chicken and fresh tomatoes was a nice touch.   Between 3 of us, the bill was around $33. Not bad. Then again, we didn't splurge on drinks or dessert, though the idea of eating their Amaretto Cheesecake makes me smile."}
{"text":"I hear this is big on the east coast. We dined with a few New Yorkers and they seemed to approve of this take on pizza. We ordered a few salads, 2 pizzas and a calzone for 6 people and it left us with left overs for 2 days.   The service was incredible but it did leave us a bit late for our next meeting. If you are in a rush and have a large group I would make arrangements before sitting down as the place can get quite busy.   Over all. Great pizzeria!"}
{"text":"My best friend, who loves to cook food and is good at it, says this is the best pizza in Arizona.  I would say it's definitely one of the top two best I've had, mainly because of their cheese.  The cheese is a little more chewy then the typical cheeses used and is full of flavor.  I imagine the quality of the cheese is very high.    We ordered a large cheese pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos.  They charge you $16 for a large, and then you have to pay for the extra items on there.  They do not sell a set pizza that is on the menu, but I am sure you can ask a waiter and they will gladly tell you what are some good combinations.  As for our combination, I thought it was pretty good if you like jalapenos.  The jalapenos gave the pizza kick.  The pepperoni and cheese part were just plain good.  My only think I was not crazy about was the sauce.  I like my sauce to more wet, but i felt the sauce was a little dry.  This is just my personal taste.  My friend, on the other hand, says she loves the sauce.s for left overs, this pizza was super delicious the next day I ate it.   I would still say this place is one of my top 2 favorite pizza places."}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time after hearing good things. The food was great and our server Tommy was Awesome. The hostess told us we were being seated next after registering using yelp and hour earlier. Well 3-4 parties are seated before us. I mentioned it to the lady who seated us and she didn't seem concerned. I was really surprised we did get a sincere apology or explanation from a manager. I don't mind waiting jut be honest with people."}
{"text":"Love this place!! My all time favorite pizza, not only in Arizona, but in the country! The general manager Brian went above and beyond to make sure I got my free pizza for my birthday after I couldn't locate my coupon in my email, Perfect customer service. I am a loyal customer for LYFE!! GO GRIMALDI'S!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Customer service is very good as well:)   Unfortunately I have to update my review our waiter was super nice but I feel like he stole $20 from us we counted our money twice yet there was $20 missing from us and 2 ppl in our group prior to us made sure the money was accounted for.."}
{"text":"Extremely attentive service here. Orders take aehoke, but this is an old fashioned coal fire grilled pizza place, so don't expect super fast orders. Great ambiance though. If you plan to go on a date here, you might want to find a quiet place."}
{"text":"I love the location and the feel of this pizzeria. It definitely feels more upscale than a normal pizza joint. Note to all parents, there is no kids menu, crayons or anything kid related here. We were kind of bummed about that.   My wife and I shared a large Caesar salad which was huge and we enjoyed it. Then for pizza we tried a large pizza with meatballs on one half of the pie. The size of the pizza was much smaller than we were anticipating. Grimaldi's and I clearly have different definitions of large. The pizza didn't look very appetizing when it was first brought to our table. Fortunately, we found out that it tastes a lot better than it looks. The pizza was great with a rich sauce and I loved the meatballs. The crust on the other hand was hard, flavorless and crunchy like a dog biscuit. I felt like a five year old with all of the crusts piled up on my plate. Ironically my three year old loved them.  Lastly we tried a sample three dessert platter with chocolate cheesecake, New York cheesecake and a cannoli. The cheesecake wasn't anything special, but my whole family enjoyed the cannoli.   The total bill was high for the amount of food that we received...especially when considering the \"large\"pizza. However we did thoroughly enjoy the pizza and cannoli so we will surely be returning to Grimaldi's in the near future."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!! Really some of the best I've ever had. Sauce, cheese, crust ratios are perfect. Sauce is really great! We all had different pizzas and we were all very pleased. I would really recommend coming here. One downside is price, it is expensive, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Had to give this place a look because of all the buzz I heard about it online. My verdict: Good pizza, but not worth going out of your way to try it if you're on vacation here.   I split a large Brooklyn Bridge pizza - a pie with tomato base, ricotta cheese, red peppers, and hand-picked Italian sausage - with a couple of friends. The first few bites were delicious, and I really enjoyed the ricotta cheese, which was sweet, creamy, and rich. After settling in, though, I found the ricotta a little bit too heavy and overpowering, so I would suggest splitting a pie two-ways for variety. Lastly, the crust nice and crispy on the edges, but extremely soggy in the middle. Don't expect too much from Grimaldi's, but still a solid slice of pizza for the price."}
{"text":"My husband and I shared a 12' cheese pizza with green peppers, it was about $12. I thought it was really good! Love the crust, perfect crunch and soft and  chewy in the inside.  Service was wonderful, two different managers kept going around asking each table if everything's okay which is awesome! Love when restaurants managers help out with bringing the food and engaging with the customers."}
{"text":"I got a 12' pizza which is $12, with extra cheese which is an additional $2, mushrooms additional $2 & green peppers additional $2. The pizza was great and the service with katie was wonderful!  Although, we went to a Grimaldi's just down the street from here at Fashion Show mall and the 12' pizza was $10. I noticed that the Grimaldi's at the Palazzo here is a couple more dollars more. I don't understand why?"}
{"text":"Tried to reserve table for two. Was informed they only accept reservations for four. Hung up and pulled up Yelp for Dom Demarco's and clicked on \"make reservation\" for two. Presto!  We're in.  Hey, Grimaldi:  Stupid is as stupid does."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza. Not just in Vegas, but my favorite pizza -- anywhere.  We always ask for the crust \"well done\".  Every time I'm in Vegas, I try to go *at least* nce.  I only wish they would open up a location in the Bay Area!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all-time favorite pizza places. Ever. My husband & I always order a large pepperoni, sausage, mushroom & onion, and it's consistent. We get a great pie every time.   The house chianti is only $4 a glass or (better deal) $9 for a half carafe. It's excellent. If you're not a fan of chianti, they have a solid wine list & plenty of great beers to pick from, or sodas, water, etc.   Still have room for dessert? They have really good cheesecake and the dessert sampler is great to share.   I haven't tried the appetizers/salads, but they look good, and large portions (shareable)."}
{"text":"Went there last night we have a great time bartender was nice and friendly we got our drinks really fast even the last one before HH ended . Got to live the decor... Bottles as lamps and corks use for art... Pizza was good ... I did like this place better than others restaurant look bigger n better we will be back to have dinner with the kids ...."}
{"text":"We been there a couple times once at the bar on a busy day ok service pizzas can be a bit better the first time we sat at the patio and all the tables around was dirty until the end some one came to clean all at once no a good site went you try to enjoy your meals...well happy hour is ok and now better on Tuesday on the wine deal i just wish the had a reverse happy hour before closing .... By the way the have 19 crimes vine  Try to collect all 19 corks lol"}
{"text":"Very nice decor super buzzy On the last Tuesday of the year last day  for half of on wines we sat at the patio we have a few glasses of wine salad  bartender was ok fast for a busy night . We be back...."}
{"text":"Now like most college students, pizza is something I eat on the regular. Maybe a slice from Metro Pizza, or a cheap $5.00 from Little Ceasars, but it's not often I go to a place wanting more than just your average slice. Grimaldi's Pizzeria is that place to get that more than average slice!  We decided to visit Grimaldi's after a brief business meeting that didn't run quite as brief as we had planned. We considered going to Monta (refer to my past review that great experience) but based on the size of the group we decided somewhere a little more open would be more suitable. A member of the group had mentioned that Grimaldi's was a great place for some pizza, and so we took a vote and Grimaldi's came out on top.  Once we arrived I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. This place really gave off a classy vibe while still being comfortable and fun. The chandeliers weren't diamond and gold, they were empty wine bottles, talk about inventive! There were older pictures framed on the wall that really made you feel like this place had something authentic going on, which I suppose it did. They only design flaw that came to mind for the group was that there was only one restroom for both genders. Not really too much of an issue when it's not that busy, but I'd imagine an unhappy line of people during the high business hours.  Now whats the first thing you look at after you sit down in a restaurant? Many people might say the table, and in that case you're probably right. But one of the first things you take a good look at is the menu. The menu I had in my night was at first a little confusing. At Grimaldi's they don't have a list of pre-built pizza, every pizza is built to order. There were three types of base pizza. The traditional pizza, a white with garlic pizza, and the pesto. Following that was a list of toppings including items like fresh cut tomatoes, meatballs, and even anchovies. Knowing their menu can be a bit daunting, the waitress was very quick to inform everyone at the table of how the ordering process went. Not only was this very helpful, it was quite entertaining as well. The staff was excellent and very knowledgeable about their menu. The waitress also helped us decide on how we would split the check before we ordered, which is great because at most places we're left at the end with 5 people who need to pay on card and no pre-arranged plan what-so-ever.  Being new to the place our side of the table decided to try something we don't usually see on a menu. We opted for a Large (18 in.) white and garlic pizza with Meatballs, Italian sausage, sun dried tomatoes, and artichoke hearts. The wait for the food was a little long, but understandable considering the table had so far ordered 3 large completely custom pizzas. The pizza that arrived was amazing. The toppings tasted quite fresh and the flavor was fantastic. The crust was enjoyable and the cheese was stringy and delicious, just how I like it. The standard condiments were at the table, parmesan and the crushed red pepper, but they were also joined by a few others like garlic powder. Each pizza was cut into 8 pieces and since we had 6 people on our check we decided it was a good idea to order a second.  The second pizza we ordered was a large Pesto with grilled chicken, roasted sweet red peppers, and freshly sliced tomatoes. If you haven't eaten a pesto pizza before, maybe Grimaldi's should be where you are having dinner tonight, this pizza was amazing. It was full of flavor, the fresh pieces chicken complimented the flavorful pesto while the sweet red pepper really brought balance to the whole ensemble. The waitress had told us that people order combinations similar to this and we can see why, it did not disappoint in the least.  Grimaldi's Pizzeria is a bit on the pricey side, the average large pizza you will build comes out to around $30.00 each, but when you break it down to each person it's not that bad. Grimaldi's over all was a great experience and definitely a good place to go if you're looking for more than the average slice of pizza and want to be daring with your choices."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza with very tomato-y, not too sweet sauce. Crispy yet chewy crust = delicious! If you're looking for gluten-free crust, you're better off going with Streets of New York or NYPD Pizza. The gluten-free crust is not bad here, but not great either - pretty flavorless."}
{"text":"My first time trying this place, and first thing i noticed was each topping was priced. As they were taking my order, they did not write it down, and attempted to memorize it which gave me little confidence in my order. The pizza doesn't hold its form, and all the toppings fall right off the pizza. Turned out that they forgot one of my toppings. Would not recommend, and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Love eating pizza here... Always get the large pizza with meatball in mushrooms! Like to not overload the topping cause it makes the thin crust too soggy! Today went with a half veggie and half loaded with meat and roasted sweet peppers!! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I like this pizza. It is more of my style. I will definitely stop by this place again. I also like the Mediterranean salad."}
{"text":"I was at the mall picking up Royce chocolate and decided to stop by for a pizza. My order was just a large cheese pizza. Service at this location was very friendly and professional. Pizza came out fast and hot. It was excellent. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Okay, I realize that most people LOVE this place so my 3 stars is going to be frowned upon BUT I must admit that I'm not a huge pizza fan and the service was far from good.  We decided to try Grimaldi's late on a Saturday night.  The hostess was quick to seat us in a half empty restaurant.  Our waitress waited 8 minutes before stopping by our table.  She said she would be right back to take our drink order.  Approximately 10 minutes later she returned and said that she was so sorry and stated that they were so busy.  As I look around I notice that more then half the tables are empty and I see numerous waitresses.  Oh well, maybe she was new.  She brings our drinks by quite some time later and apologizes again.  I can't stand when people keep saying sorry with no meaning behind it!  If you're sorry, change what you are doing!!  Eventually we got some food!!  Pizza - you choose your toppings for every pizza which range from $2 a piece to $4 a piece.  You can easily make a $30 pizza.  It's thin crust and it was eh!  I ordered white Sangria which was different!  It kind of tasted like moscato and sprite with a slice of orange.   The only pizza I really enjoyed was Pizza Fusion and they are gone! :'( I would try other pizza places before I came back here."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this restaurant, I was a bit skeptical to try this location. Additionally, I had never been to a Grimaldi's. So, going into this dining experience, I had already set the bar rather high for the food  and the bar rather low for the service.  I was excited when we didn't have to wait for a table. We were a party of two and they sat us right in front of the kitchen. We had a great view of everything in the restaurant and were not crowded or cramped one bit.  The surrounding and ambiance is pretty corporate. It kind of looks like a few notches above NYPD Pizza. Red checkered tablecloths (although not vinyl), white linen napkins, subway signs etc.  The service was great - we were greeted within 2 minutes and we had a thorough explanation of the menu (which is limited to pizza, salad, and desserts).  We ordered a medium (or whatever is between large and personal) pizza with Italian sausage and sweet roasted red bell peppers, a small house salad to split, a beer for him and a syrah for me...(the wine list is a little corporate - but there are some god finds for the $$)  Our server was very cognizant of taking our plates when were finished with the salad (and even knew NOT to take away his plate until i was finished) and when our pizza came out (perfectly timed after salad) the runner served our first pieces (and asked to do so)  The manager, Deron, stopped by to make sure everything was going great - and you could tell was genuinely concerned about how our meal was going thus far.  Our server offered us dessert - didn't push out when she noticed we hadn't finished our drinks - and then was paid and went home (Canoli in hand)  The food was GREAT. The pizza was perfect (to my tastes - I'm NOT a Chicago pizza fan), the salad wasn't drenched in dressing and the dressing that was accompanying the perfectly torn lettuce was the perfect mixture of oil and vinegar. Let me tell you this seems to be a huge problem in Phoenix - Phoenix restaurants seem to have a huge issue with understanding ratios of vinegar to oil.  At any rate, the canoli was excellent - and although I've had much different presentations, this was one was awesome.  I love Friday night dinner/date night. It's the perfect ending to a tough week (which i just had) and I hate when it's spoiled with bad service and bad food. I would and will definitely return to Grimaldi's on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Grimaldi's on Eastern before this branch opened. This one is closer to where I currently live. My husband and I love their pizza and don't eat pizza elsewhere, unless we really have to. The flavors are phenomenal. I do think, however, that the Eastern Avenue branch makes better pizza on a consistent basis than this one. On a couple of occasions, the crust here was overdone: it was hard, like a cracker. Plus, the service isn't as great as the other branch. We've had waiters forget things here. The pizza here is still better than elsewhere, but I think the Eastern Ave. branch is better."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is just fantastic, unpretentious pizza.  It's thin, salty, cheesy, greasy, New York style pizza with delicious toppings and crust!  One of the better pies I've had on the West Coast!"}
{"text":"We were sent here by comedian Vinnie Favorito after we ran into him and the Flamingo valet.  This place didn't disappoint as it has a very cool atmosphere.  I suggest coming later in the evening and sitting outside on their patio."}
{"text":"We always stop here for  a dinner when in town to golf. The pizza is quite good and the service friendly and attentive. They have very good salads as well and I tried the chopped kale salad and really enjoyed the flavors."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed... The house salad was way over dressed. The pizza wasn't all that impressive and the service just flat out sucked.  Wouldn't recommend. I'd rather eat frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizzeria in the Palazzo was one of the best meals I had while visiting Las Vegas! We had the white garlic pizza (so good!) and the margarita pizza, with two salads to share.   The food was above expectation, large and delicious.... and the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Prices were very fair, and it was a relaxing atmosphere. I would recommend.   If you are celebrating your birthday, be sure to sign up on their website and they will send you a free pizza deal!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza with really fresh toppings. You may want to order a size bigger than usual based on the super thin crust"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, huge pies, generous toppings - yum. J and i had the garlic sauce pizza with artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, our friends had sun dried tomatoes with ricotta and red sauce.  both were very good.  Shared a house salad that easily could feed 3 people.  Cute place!"}
{"text":"Cheap,fast,decent and plentiful.  Sometimes this place is a bit too crowded,but other than that worth a looksee."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Super cute patio!  We were there planning our rehearsal dinner and all of the waiters and the catering person we spoke with were so nice, patient, and helpful.  And, the pizza is AMAZING."}
{"text":"This place has really good pizza. My family and I have been there a couple of times. Each time we go we order a simple pepperoni pizza and a salad. The salads are ok but they makeup for it with the pizza."}
{"text":"This is NOT the same Grimaldis that is up on 59th Ave & 101 in Glendale.  The Grmaldis here in Peoria claims original roots to the famous Grimaldis in New York.  Extremely thin \"Neopolitan\" pizza is served up here and it was quite good.  Good quality cheese, minimal sauce, and a few good beers are on tap (Pilsener Urquell paired well with their food).  Located across from the movie theatre so it may be worthwile to dine at hours when people won't be going to the movies so much."}
{"text":"This is the pizza place that spoiled the taste of any other pizza for me, because it is the best I've ever had ! Oh how I miss you Grimaldi's !  Nothing compares to you ; )"}
{"text":"OMG love this place! Food is very YUMYMY.  Always crowed when I have come which makes for very CLOSE seating and long wait times.  They do take reservations and you could always take food to go :-)"}
{"text":"I can truly say that this locations pizza is better then the one I had at the original under the Brooklyn Bridge. We always like to dine at the patio. Ambiance is good. The Service has been good all the times we have been here. We ordered the Mediterranean salad was really good. The White with garlic Ricotta Pizza was great. The tiramisu was amazing!  So we keep on going back."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch the other day and loved it.  At first I was a bit skeptical, since the entire menu was on my placemat, but once we all ordered and I tasted their pizza, it was absolutely amazing.  The crust was thin, not cracker-like thin, and very tasty.  Our group got a couple of regular pizzas and one white pizza, which was out of this world.  I was not able to try the desserts or any beverages of the alcoholic sort (since my VP was at lunch with me), but I would say that next to Pizzeria Bianco, this is the best pizza in the valley.  Service was great, atmosphere was wonderful, and some of the best pizza I have ever had."}
{"text":"Any local will tell you , Boca Park on a Friday night ...busy. Our first choice was Biersch , we go in and they tell us 30 minute wait time. The kids are whining , it's 7-30 and they need to eat . We try Grimaldi's , they say \" 15 minutes \" . Done deal.  After 30 minutes we are seated , our server is truly excellent , offered water , ice teas immediately . They arrive about 2 minutes later . Great.  The menu , Pizza or Salad . That's it , no sides , appetizers , nothing. It's a Pizza restaurant so I suck it up. They do give you a small plate of thinly sliced bread with oil & vinegar so the kids are slightly placated.  We order one large cheese pie , and one large pie with grilled chicken and mushrooms.  These pizzas are FABULOUS! Our server dispensed the first slices , offered some condiments before leaving . Delicious , thin crispy pizza served very hot. Could not have asked for more.   Wine and beer menus are extensive , place is typical ' we're from NY Italian heritage ' decorated but very well done.  Server boxed the uneaten pizza for us and we left.   Will we go back. For sure."}
{"text":"This place was so crowded!  Definitely a happening place.   Pizzas were so dependable and delicious.  Love Grimaldi.   No matter what city.  Pizza with care"}
{"text":"the crust is amazing, however everything else about the pizza seems bland. the sauce just tastes like tomato paste with some basic and the cheese just tasted flavorless (fresh but flavorless) very nice atmosphere, just only ok food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately before coming to this location, I had the privilege of visiting their popular location in Brooklyn, NY. I say that because I was expecting quite a bit because of the experience I had in New York and how it was nothing like i had had before. The Grimaldi's here on Rampart was very nice inside but when it comes to the food, I'll be honest and say it's above par but not nearly the as good as their location in New York. I'll more than likely be back because of the nostalgic feeling I get while eating their pizza... :)"}
{"text":"Concierge said that this place has bomb pizza. She was right.   For tourists, this place was way out of there but definitely worth the drive through the ghetto.   our server was an older woman, blonde hair and super awesome.   loved that the menu was simple. a few starters, pizza, and salads  large pepperoni. thats all we wanted.  my girl needs sauce w all her food so we asked for ranch... THEY DONT HAVE ANY she says. im shocked and impressed. they keep it real italian. she offered their creamy caesar and was delightfully pleased.   if im at a restaurant normally id eat pizza w a knife and fork but this one just begged to picked up, folded, and held. the mozzarella di bufalo and tangy/sweet marinara were reminiscent of the margheritas in naples.   a fantastic pizza eating experience"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Crisp crust. Very light sauce and cheese. Homemade mozarella that they slice into thin rounds on pizza. If you want a cheese, saucy pizza they don't have it here. A bit pricey. The pepperoni is nice and thick. The meatballs are a little tasteless. Get fresh basil on your pizza-- so good. The restaurant itself is in a great location."}
{"text":"These guys are on my list of top Pizzerias as number one in Las Vegas for a reason.  The pizza is amazing and ingredients are supper fresh making for a tasty and satisfying dish.  The décor is almost a high end and vintage Italian restaurant feel.    The staff is top notch and always on top of your order, your drinks and able to give recommendations.  The last time I was here I took my out of towners here for lunch telling them this is my favorite spot.  My buddy told me I was building it up so well in their minds they were going to be so disappointed with the experience if they didn't live up to what I was saying.  I never thought of it like that and was nervous as we sat down.   We ordered a salad and split it amongst three people; a large pizza and when it was sat before us my friends both smiled ear to ear and said WOW! That is an incredible pizza; I said wait till you taste it and they both instantly melted into their seats with satisfaction.   The outdoor seating is comfortable;  the bar staff is very nice and they make small talk very well if you let them but will respect your space if you are watching the tv or playing on your mobile device.  I know the price scares a lot of people away but trust me you will not regret your dining experience here."}
{"text":"So Ive had to ponder this review for a few days as Im conflicted. In all fairness this is by far the best pizza Ive had since moving to Las Vegas over a year ago. When I first moved here I ate at a new pizza joint every week in hopes of finding a good slice.  I finally found a great slice made in Vegas and Ive eaten at three of their locations now and the pizza has never disappointed.  That being said I did find a big hunk of metal in my salad. I want to give them negative stars for that alone but I love their pizza so much I cant.   What I can say is that the manager came over and told me the salads were on the house and helped me fill out their incident report. I was physically fine and just lucky I hadn't swallowed it as I was thinking it was an olive pit.   We were happy with that but 10 minutes later the owner came over to make sure I was OK and said the entire meal was on him and that we should have desert as well.  Just to show you how much I love this pizza we couldn't take him up on the offer as we were all stuffed.  Ok so outside of the Salad the Pizza was coal fired perfection and the owner/staff made the entire experience top notch and you shouldn't be afraid to try them out.  I know the price can freak you out but its worth every penny.  A break down of our experience here would be:  Salad 1 out of 5 (explanation already given)  Pizza 4 out of 5 (half order of onions turned into light onions on entire pizza)  Management 8 out of 5 (after my last experience like this I have to say all crisis like this should be handled so professionally.  Wait staff 4 out of 5 (we had empty drinks on our table a lot and Im sure that was because she was to nervous to come back to the table. She did a great job besides the empty drinks and we did tip her a good amount even though we were eating for free.  I have to say give them a chance just be careful chewing the salad."}
{"text":"First time at Grimaldi's in Scottsdale with the family! Packed house, but they found us a table quickly! The pepperoni and ham topping pizza was amazing especially if you like thin crust. Customer service was awesome! Only down side is trying to find a parking spot. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great for dates, meetings, great service, awesome food. The pizza is wood grilled pizza.  I haven't been anywhere this good yet. For me, as a poor college student, it's expensive but I looked up authentic New York style pizza and this place came up. Awesome place. The table cloth you usually see that is red and white squared at restaurants is plastic but this place uses real cloth, AUTHENTIC. The food is quick.   This place actually wowed me. I usually get carry out for pizza from pizza chains, but this is far from a pizza chain. Pizza chains like papa johns, little cesars, Domino's, Pizza hut use ingredients that are chopped and small. For example, the big four DO NOT use SLICED tomatos, they DICE them. Grimaldi's SLICES tomatos AND onions, slices are about 2-2.5 in long, the big four uses chopped onion about 1/4 in long, aka budget cuts.  Their pizzas are incredibly HUGE. They charge for additional toppings which can add up BUT WHO THE HELL CARES!!!! THIS PLACE IS FAMILY OWNED AND QUALITY!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided on Grimaldi's after realizing a drive into the strip was a bit far and we were starving!  Ordered a Pepperoni, sausage, & mushroom pizza.   And while I'm biased because we waited so long for it, It was a good pizza with a thin crust (just the way I like it)  I will definitely come back, but if I'm getting to-go I'm ordering beforehand. /)__-"}
{"text":"Very yummy pizza, everything is served family style.  Service was awesome, she suggested pizza with pesto and marinara sauce on it together and it was delicious!! The waitress noticed that there was a problem with our pizza and took care of it and gave us a complimentary pizza to make up for it.  Our waitress' name was Alyicia, ask for her."}
{"text":"Authentic Brooklyn style pizza is what Grimadli's is all about.  I actually don't have a comparison to Brooklyn pizza, but it is pretty darn good.  When you arrive, expect to have at least a 30 minute wait, if not longer.  The great thing is that they give a buzzer that looks like a pizza, so you can walk around nearby in Old Town or hit up a bar.  If you plan on eating an entire pizza, expect to have at least 3-4 people helping you.  Their slices are huge.  We got a pizza with red marinara sauce base along with onions, olives, and bell peppers.  The pizza came in about 20 minutes and it smelled incredible.  The pizza had a thin crust but a hearty taste.  The pizza size is enormous, so don't be thinking its a light pizza just because it is thin.  The service was fantastic even with a busy audience.  I would come here again with a small group of people and enjoy some pizza."}
{"text":"We've been to Grimaldi's in Gilbert, AZ as well as Corpus Christi, TX. My first date with my wife was at the one in Corpus Christi. We recently celebrated my wife's birthday at the one in Arizona. They have always been good, consistent experiences. Our waiter in Arizona was attentive and exceptional. We'll continue to go back."}
{"text":"Absolute fave in Scottsdale. Their pesto pizza is a must-have! Only pizza I wouldn't mind eating everyday. We've only ordered take-out from this location but even during the pick-up, the staff was very friendly. I always pick up from pesto and pepperoni pizza when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Ugh. I really tried to like Grimaldis. I really did. I was craving a calzone, after not having one in years, so I ordered it off the menu. This was my first time experience.. I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza, so I went for the ooy gooy calzone.  Man! What a bummer. It was a piece of poo. Too bad I spent 15 bucks on the thing, but I was really unhappy. My boyfriend ordered the calzone too, and again... blah.  It was pizza dough filled with CHEESE. Just straight out CHEESE. No sauce INSIDE the calzone, just pure cheese. And I normally am fine with cheese, but 5 pounds of it stuffed in dough is not my thing. It was a mix of mozzarella and I'm assuming ricotta cheese, and it had some spices in it that made the flavor pretty good. They peppered the top of the crust (not sure why), and every now and again I found chunks of chicken I paid 5 dollars to add. The chicken had to have come out of a can and not cooked by them. It was foamy like that chicken you get in a can of soup. My boyfriend got the sausage, and by looking at the insides it was hard to find any even in there. Sauce was served on the side... We took home most of it as left overs, and both agreed on trashing a good 8 pounds of cheese filled dough.  The sauce in itself isn't even that great. Man I'm bummed this place was so over rated. I'm sticking to Nellos. Heck I'd eat costco pizza over this stuff.  The outside was nice for sitting though! And the waiter was nice. And it was a lot of food, but just in-edible."}
{"text":"I found this place using Yelp ;) It had the best reviews and there was one close by our timeshare on the south end of the strip. There are 5 Grimaldi's locations in Las Vegas. We called in a carry out order at the Rainbow St. location. At this location they have parking spaces assigned for carry out, you pull up and they bring out your order ...... very convenient.  I never had coal brick before (none where I live) so I don't have anything to compare it too but that doesn't change this fact that this pizza was DELICIOUS!!! I believe the best I ever had. I'm a total pizza junkie.... HONESTLY, I can eat it daily (but I don't) it was thin, crispy and not greasy at all! The ingredients were very fresh & it was cooked to perfection. Our family ordered 2 large pizzas, one pepperoni and the other pepperoni, jalapenos & mushroom.   My only complaint was they put very little mushrooms on our pizza and for $2.00 per topping I expected more mushrooms. All the other topping were fine just very short on the mushrooms. I thought the price was fair although I think that $2.00 per topping is a bit steep. We kept our pizza pretty basic because it can add up fast. It came to about $50.00 for 2 pizzas, as expected for \"restaurant quality\" pizza. I'm a firm believer in \"You get what you pay for\". If you're looking for GREAT not good pizza then this is the place. I'm sad they don't have one in Cali but I will come back.................. Just for the pizza :)"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is the most consistently amazing pizza place in Arizona. We've been to this Old Town location quite a few times in the past year and not once have we had a bad pie. The pizza is always uber-fresh with crispy crust and amazing flavor.   We've never had any issues with the wait staff, they're attentive and generally on top of things... but to be honest, even if the wait staff here was horrible, I'd still give the place 5 stars because the pizza is that good. I think they put crack in that dough, because I'm addicted. 5/5 stars."}
{"text":"Decent pizzas. Good price. Great service. I used to live in NYC and loved grimaldis there. This one is not close. Sauce does not taste as good as NY, maybe its the water."}
{"text":"I don't get why everyone thinks this place is so great. A friend recommended this place awhile ago and I finally tried it and was totally disappointed. Their crust sucks and is paper-thin. I was expecting deep-dish crust with tons of flavor. What they have is communion-wafer crust that they over cook. I ordered mine with pepperoni and \"meatballs\". These meatballs looked more like meat discs. And my pizza was way too dark. It looked burnt. I honestly liked the salad better."}
{"text":"I came here for a wedding brunch when in town for a family occasion! Well pizza outside of NY is... um how do i say this..... CRAP-TASTIC but when I walked into Grimaldi's here in AZ, i realized that this is a different location of a NY classic.  While I haven't been to the NY one in ages (I can only handle waiting so long and it's been a long time since i could/would kill a pie on my own) this place almost made me cry. Old-school checkered table cloth (red & white) and pictures of home everywhere, this is NY in AZ.  I had high hopes.... the pie was good. Not great but better than expected. I'm happy to live in NYC where I can get AMAZING pizza any time. But if you are ever in this area and are in the mood for pizza, this place will make you happy."}
{"text":"not really what i expected. i guess i expected new york style pizza which is not what this is. also they don't sell just slices, only pies. we got a cheese and a white pie. it was just ok."}
{"text":"Pizza was Amazing! Non-Grease, Thin Sliced, Good Blend of Sauce & Cheese.  Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"For me, location is key. This (physical) location sucks. But the pizza is worth all of that. And the patio is a pleasant space to enjoy the weather with your pie and a glass of wine as applicable. For this visit, I dined on the patio with a glass of said wine. My pepperoni, mushroom & spinach pizza wasn't served hot, which was a disappointment.  After this was pointed out to my server, I received a nice visit from a manager. We had a pleasant chat and he offered me a complimentary piece of cheesecake, which I accepted. I still believe that Grimaldi's is one of the best pies in town. For the quality you get, the price is reasonable.  Oh, and they could wipe water spots off the wine glasses. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Opening night for their new location at the Shoppes at the Palazzo! Grimaldi's literally rolled out the red carpet and gave us 5 star service.  I got to sample a variety of pizza, salads and delicious cannoli. The staff loves working here, and it shows! I've had the white pizza at Griamldi's other locations, and it didn't disappoint here. The decor is authentic (love the wine bottle chandeliers) and the restaurant space and front bar are cozy. The bartenders showed their skill when making me an awesome Manhattan! Bonus- you can access Grimaldi's from one of the Palazzo's Strip-side staircases."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a white pizza with garlic & I added bacon on a perfect 70 degree day!  The house red wine was a smart choice too! Love the patio which is close to a fountain and adds a nice ambiance. The pizza was fresh and hot and very tasty! I made it just before they shut down the ovens for an hour (which I didn't see posted at the restaurant). Lucky me, I was really looking forward to a birthday pizza! A great spot to eat outdoors and bask in our lovely weather while enjoying one of the Valley's best pies! They are very generous with toppings and I doubt many other joints are as generous as Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker. I'll always be a New Yorker. And that menas I'm serious about pizza. All of that said, I'm serious about Grimaldi's. This is one of my favorite locations for dough, cheese and other stick-to-your gut goodness. The bar ain't bad either. The place is always crowded (expect to rub elbows with anyone sitting next to you) but the crowd only adds to the festive atmosphere. From the dining room, you can see the pizza being made and marvel as the servers navigate the maze of tables. Prices are decent and if you sign up for e-mail alerts, you'll be treated to small perks like the occassional coupon or discount on your birthday."}
{"text":"I've always had good service here, but we usually do the curbside pick up - my advice is to just order a few toppings.  The crust cannot handle more than one or two - and if you get the pesto, avoid getting pepperoni plus other meat, it's so greasy!  (Good, but greasy).    Love the greek salad as well as their desserts."}
{"text":"First of all , I have nothing to against to have kids in the restaurant, but if there are 8 tabes, I'm the only one don't have kids , that's a little overwhelming, I felt like I was in chuck e cheese , nothing wrong with that but I just didn't expect it hats all! I guess I just order to go next time lol  Secondly , my waiter got very confused about my change and making me confused as well , the whole thing was just CONFUSED!!!   But the spinach salad and the don pizza were pretty good ! I won't go back anytime sooner , if I do , I definitely order to go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! we got a large pizza, half white sauce with garlic and the other half with pizza sauce with toppings. the pizza sauce was whatever but the white sauce was pretty amazing. we got the spinach salad which was also really good and well dressed and had nice portions of Gorgonzola cheese and bacon. The staff is pretty nice and the food was great."}
{"text":"I personally had no problem with my pizza. I got a personal pizza with chicken (add $5 alone for that), bell peppers, pineapple, and onions. I'll shamefully admit though, my pizza alone was at least $20. Ridiculous, I'll never do it again and the only reason they got my money was because I had a nice buzz off some drinks my husband and I made back at our room because honestly, no way in hell would I have paid that sober.   Everyone was pretty happy with the exception of my sister-in-law. She ordered a cheese pizza with extra cheese. I think they got it twisted and gave her extra sauce instead. When we asked our server, he said that was extra cheese. She asked to speak to a manager and he said the same thing. Sorry, I'm not picky or anything but I wouldn't have accepted that as being extra cheese.   I'm an easy person to please so for someone to piss me off at a restaurant is pretty rare. I wish I would have gotten the girls name because her people skills need some work. I asked if I could get some ranch for my pizza (hello, Californian here!) and the girl straight up said, \"No, we don't have any.\" and trotted her happy a$$ away from the table. Nothing as far as a, \"No, sorry we don't carry ranch here.\" or anything in that format. Just basically a screw off and deal with it.   For $50 in pizza for 2, I expect more than that when asked a question honestly."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! It's consistently good. Their pizza is fantastic - it's not greasy, lots of fresh topping options, and a sauce that would make slap your mama it's so good! My favorite salad is the Mediterranean; the dressing is tangy and very flavorful. The only disappointment with this place is they don't have enough people working at lunch - I order curbside and have to go inside after waiting 5-10 minutes without anyone acknowledging me. Annoying but not anything that would prevent me from eating/ordering there"}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent. Oh how I wish we had one of these in Atlanta or a neighboring town. The crust was thin, but not paper thin. The pizza was huge. I literally stuffed myself because I had to get on plane after leaving this place. The price was fair based on what you got. When my group went, it was definitely busy and I can see why. The next time I'm in the vicinity of a Grimaldi's, I'll be ordering a pizza and engorging myself into it."}
{"text":"OK Pizza but certainly not worth the hour and a half wait after the hostess forgot us and only remembered our party after our third request about how long the wait time would be. The manager sent an antipasto tray to the table and I was astounded at what it was for the price on the menu.  Four pieces of salami, some roasted peppers, mozarella, and olives.  I could have made four trays for the price...just saying.  Pizza is good but way overpriced and if you want any toppings besides cheese, you're going to pay for them...  I will give kudos to our waiter, Zack - he made the event a little more tolerable, but I will be taking my pizza business elsewhere, for sure!"}
{"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet! Great thin crust pizza, delish sangria, and cool atmosphere.   Service was decent.. took awhile to get drinks, and for him to check in on us, but maybe he was new! :)   I would recommend it for sure! :) Cute casual date night spot too!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town! The atmosphere is just as great as the food.  This location has a great front patio!  Salads are a good sharing size.... love ordering a pepperoni, sausage, and ricotta cheese pizza, and of course I always have to have a cannoli for dessert!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is one of my favorite pizza places! The atmosphere is just as great as the food.  This location is located on the strip inside of the Palazzo Casino.    Salads are a good sharing size.... love ordering a pepperoni, sausage, and ricotta cheese pizza, and of course I always have to have a cannoli for dessert!  Definitely recommend Grimaldi's!"}
{"text":"I never rate on Yelp due to horrendous service but I feel like everyone should be warned. We sat down and ordered 15 minutes later, got our salads then waited an hour before we noticed our food was not at the table yet. After addressing it with the manager she said it would be ANOTHER 40 minutes and was not apologetic and had informed us that our server should have told us it was 1.5 wait for our pizza.  This place is seriously unorganized and is in desperate need of a staff revamp. We couldn't wait because we had an event so all 9 of us had to leave. They still charged us for our alcohol. This is the worst dining experience I have ever encountered and will never be eating at this location EVER AGAIN.  This location needs a serious reality check, you are running your business to the ground!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's Pizza is absolutely the best in town. The crisp, chewy crust is absolutely incredible! However, service this evening was poor. We waited about 45 minutes for food and then another 20 for the check. Our drinks were never refilled over the course of the meal and we were not checked up on whatsoever. I'd like to stress, though, that the pizza is top notch. I always get the margarita with chicken. Love it. I wish the service stood up to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"really great pizza.  atmosphere is fun ... a little fancier than your regular pizza place.  but the price is still very reasonable.  would have given 5 stars if the service was better.  our server was actually quite rude.  but i won't judge the whole place on one bad apple ;)   the pizza and house wine is worth another trip."}
{"text":"Always been a long time fan. Pizza, salad and service are always exceptional. Never had a bad day here. Probably the best pizza I've ever had. Even the water tastes like New York.They also just recently added a full bar! Two complaints - first, it is very noisy. During good weather this can be avoided by sitting outside. However, if you choose to sit inside, be prepared. Secondly, because this place is so great, it is getting a lot more popular. Last time we went here I had a very hard time finding a parking spot. Had to resort to parking across the street, which is very inconvenient."}
{"text":"This review is for Grimaldi's in general. Having been to the original Brooklyn location, having Grimaldi's within a two hour drive always calls for a visit every time we're in the Las Vegas area.        Since we discovered that Grimaldi's is here in Vegas, we've been to three of the four locations and have not been disappointed with the food or the service.       The pizza is as close as to what I remembered in New York. Like any pizza place, choose your favorites but definitely try the white with garlic pizza n your choice of toppings. Ricotta cheese is also a must.      If you're a thin crust lover, you'll love Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"I held a surprise b-day party for my hubby here last Saturday night. We had about 35 guests and the party was in their private banquet room off of the front entrance (the Rockefeller Room??).  All in all, Grimaldi's did a wonderful job.  Nakita in catering was very easy to work with-- pleasant and efficient.  Jesse was put in charge of our party that night and did an incredible job!  He set the room, tended bar, served the food, bussed the tables and took care anything/everything else we needed (basically all by himself!!) that night.  I knocked off one star, as the food was a bit choppy in its arrival (not that big of a deal by the end of the evening, but the natives were definitely getting a little restless for a bit) and the manager on duty, Katherine, was neither very friendly nor very helpful. (Although she was not actually rude, there was definitely a bit of attitude when I asked for her help regarding the food, etc.)  But, as I said, all in all, Grimaldi's did a great job and, as always(!!) the food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Quite simply this is really good pizza. I am always in search of great pizza and Grimaldi's was on the way home from work. Now for a chain it is a little pricey, my large pepperoni, sausage and mushroom was $24. $16 for a large, $3 for pepperoni, $3 for sausage and $2 for mushrooms.  I think this is one of the best tasting chain store pizzas I have had in Vegas/Henderson. The crust was excellent, thin and just the right amount of crispy. The toppings were generous and high quality. The cheese and sauce were a perfect amount and very tasty. Overall a really well made and good tasting pizza.  I did take one star off as it took almost an hour for a to go order (apparently cleaning their ovens) and I think $24 is a little pricey for a large 3 topping. With that being said I WILL be coming back."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had!!!!  My husband and I were so excited that they opened one in the Southwest!   Great service, staff, and food!!!  Gotta try the Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake, as well!"}
{"text":"I had been in search of the greatest pizza in Las Vegas and found it! Great thin crust perfectly crisp, and the pepperoni is actually to die for. I've never said that before about pepperoni. The only problem is that it's usually pretty busy, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good with fresh ingredients. The house salad was bursting with fresh flavor. The prices were decent considering the restaurant is on the strip. Would have given five stars if the service was quicker."}
{"text":"Unfortunately had 2 bad experiences now which means a 1 star is confirmed. Last time they clearly burned my pizza and still served it to me. It wasn't until I gave the waitress a look that she offered to make me a new one. This time I think they forgot to put my order in and kept saying 'almost ready'. I called them out on it and the manager made some excuse and even if true, still didn't excuse their lack of communication. Will never go back to the San Tan location and perhaps the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Grimaldi's Pizzeria for a friend's birthday.  We arrived relatively early for dinner and seating was not an issue, compared to the tougher task of finding a parking space not too far from the restaurant.  We ordered an antipasto course, which I though was good, but not exceptional.  We also ordered 2 medium pizza, with each half having different combination of toppings for more variety.  I like the thin and crispy pizza crust that is served here, which is not greasy like those served at some other pizzerias.  Overall the dining experience was A-OK!  The price of the bill was reasonable, especially for being in the more upscale Boca Park area of town.  However, it is also one of the more memorable dining experience for us, since one of the ladies in our party was apparently hit on while we were waiting for our drinks and appetizers to arrived by a totally random but well dress man.  And of all the topics to use to start the conversation, it was about carpal tunnel surgery (because her arm is still in a sling).  This carried on for about 5 minutes, before we realized that he is one of the FOH managers of the restaurant.  Anyway, he came back several times to check up on us, and also to correct a mistake in our bill (we ordered 2 medium pizzas, but one of them was accidentally written as a large).   I would recommend this place for a casual get together, especially before or after shopping at Boca Park."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Ordered pepperoni pizza. Perfect amount for rhe 3 of us with left overs. House salad good too. Great atmosphere. Our waiter, Ceasar, will great and nice. Came to check on us often. Will be back again"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizzeria in Las Vegas. Shombi, was our bartender / server . We had the margarita pizza add on jalapeños and pepperoni with the house salad and banana cheese cake for dessert and it was just fantastic !!!!!  I had the watermelon mule that was just perfect ! So amazed by this little spot in the palazzo . Will continue to come here to get my grab on !!! Thank you !!!! Ps do not ask for a Coke Zero they do not have it. lol"}
{"text":"From the time I entered the place until I left, my family and I were well treated by the entire staff.  Not to mention the food was off the hook!!!  I Love their Pizza.  I thought it was a fluke the first time I ate there.  But, No!  This was my third time and I've received Great treatment EVERY time."}
{"text":"This is our favorite brick oven pizza place. We have been back 20+ times and have only been disappointed once. The pie took 1.5 hours because someone forgot to fire the coals early. The manager fixed it by giving us a free large pie on our next visit. Sign everyone up for the birthday club. A free birthday pizza every year. Parking is tight around here because of the Harkins across the street.  When our kids were little the wait staff would give them a pizza pan with some dough on it to play with while we waited for the pie.  As for the pizza, we love it. Thin crust and folds perfectly for one handed eating. The salads are top notch.  This place has a nice NY feel and was a real welcome addition to the west side. Worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Ordered the white pizza with tomato onion and kalamata olives and was pretty tasty. They recommended that the pizza be cooked for an extended amount of time because of the wet ingredients which caused the crust to be slightly burned with a tad too much crunch for my tastes.  Plenty of staff inside.  Interior atmosphere was o.k.  The only markdown I give them is the price. It seemed to lack value and was over priced.  Probably will not return given it is too far away from me...and even if there were one closer, other places would get my dollar first."}
{"text":"It is pretty good pizza, possibly a bit pricey but you get a good product.  I got a large pepperoni.  The cheese on it isn't the shredded mozza kind but seems to be either bigger slices or balls that are put on the pizza and melted sporadically.  The pepperoni were really small slices and looked to be freshly cut.  It's more Neapolitan style than anything else.  Some of the pizza seemed to have some sort of seasoning on it.  All of those bites were really good, but the ones without it and no pepperoni weren't as tasty.  The crust is pretty great, I actually ate it instead of just tossing it out.  Would probably order again."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the meditteranean salad was delicious.. Love the create your own style menu.  The staff is great and atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable.."}
{"text":"Crust was flavorless and limp. As soon as they brought it out the crust just flopped. Oven not hot enough. Ingredients diversity was not also available. I can make better from my own home. .... Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I tried Grimaldi's for the first time at least a year ago. I don't even remember if I like the pizza here, so it was a good time to come back and try it again.  Service: 2 Stars. Ugh....Where do I begin? If you get a server named Jilani, beware!! You may want to ask for someone else. I usually don't name employees who gave bad service in my reviews, but this guy made me angry! We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was perfect timing because we had just missed the lunch rush and it wasn't as crowded. After the hostess showed us to our table, we waited for 15 minutes until our server finally showed up. What annoyed me was that there was another couple that was sitting right next to us and arrived after we did. Yet, they got serviced by Jilani first. A few minutes later, I overheard the hostess telling him that we came in first and have been waiting for a while. Thank you for actually noticing. He obviously sucks at keeping track of his tables. Finally, he stops by our table. No \"Hello\" or \"Welcome,\" just \"What would you like to order?\" We pretty much didn't see him until paying for our bill. Other servers, who were much more friendly, brought us our drinks and food. 2 starts for them! Jilani did not care to check on us while we were eating, nor did he offer to refill our drinks. After we were done, we waited for another 15 minutes until he finally showed up again and asked \"You want me to box that?\" No, I'm going to spend the rest of the day here staring at my 3 slices of leftover pizza. What do you think?! A few minutes later, he dropped off the pizza and bill without saying a word. I don't even know why I left him a tip. Although it was much less that what I would have left for a good server.   Food: 4 Stars. Not the best tasting pizza I have eaten, but still pretty good. I don't know if I came here on a off day, but my pepperoni pizza was a bit salty. I do like their crispy thin crust and fresh ingredients. Although once in a while, the cheese would completely fall off the slice.  If you sign up for their VIP newsletter through their website, you will get a coupon for $5 off your next bill. They also give you a free pizza on your birthday.  Hoping for better service the next time around!"}
{"text":"Kid Friendly, good layout.  The entire staff here seemed happy.  The food was excellent.  A bit too expensive for me to go every week, but it was worth it.  Ordered a large with pepperoni.  It was fantastic, the cheese, the sauce, the crust, all perfect.  My wife thought it was burnt when she first saw the pizza, but she loved it too."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and great service. Fresh ingredients and everything  is amazing. The outside seating is very nice and the inside is nice also."}
{"text":"If you are in a mood for some brick oven pizza, come here! The crust is crunchy and bubbly! The cheese is stringy and goo-ey and the red sauce made just right. yum, yum, yum! =)"}
{"text":"Best pizza chain in us!!!  I have had their famous pizza in 3 states- texas, Nevada, and Arizona  and all of them taste delicious !!!  10.0 -appetizer- Caesar salad- enough to feed a family of 4. Great portions and fresh ingredients  10- pizza- pepperoni and Italian sausage. So crispy and fresh from the brick oven.  The pizza is made with such fresh ingredients combined with the taste of the brick oven. Just melts in your mouth!!!"}
{"text":"The first slice CAN NOT be beat. However, the remainder of the slices are always greasy and wet or super dry (weird, eh?). The first bite will be the best bite you've ever had and it's downhill from there. They need to fix their pans to solve this problem. The prices are insanely high for pizza. If you load it up, you can end up with a 30 dollar pizza that one huge eater could destroy."}
{"text":"Maybe the best New York style pizza I've had (caution: I'm not from NYC). \"The Don\" pizza was loaded with delicious pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs. All were delicious, but the meatballs rose above the rest. The sauce and crust were also great. Very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"After living in AZ for a year I finally tried Grimaldi's pizza. Wow --   What I liked: - the thin-crust pizza served piping hot. Definitely up there with the best pizza in town. - the \"make your own\" style of the menu -- there's a based price for a pie, and each ingredient you add is about $2. - the wine selection (and prices). There are plenty of nice bottles for $20. - There seemed to be ample parking, which tends to be tough in this neighborhood.  What I didn't like: - the crowds and wait time at 7PM on Saturday, although I can see why it's worth the wait. - Lack of variety -- the menu could benefit from more salad options, for example - the bar area could be larger to better accommodate waiting customers"}
{"text":"We were from out of town. The fashion mall concierge gave us a coupon that recommended this place. I checked it out on yelp and we gave it a try. Very glad we did.   Very good service. Very good pizza. (Huge pizza). Nice thin crust with great flavor from the brick oven.   We got traditional with onions, bacon and kalamata olives and split the spinach salad. Soooo good. Would eat here a lot if I were local."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum!!  I usually get the pizza and with that I am pretty plain, just cheese!  But it is really good!  I was at the San Tan location yesterday and bought some gift cards, I asked if they were good at all the locations and was told yes.  Then I saw from another Yelper that the Queen Creek location had closed, I was a bit surprised and disappointed, no one had mentioned it.  I hope this location doesn't close anytime soon!    I love coming to the San Tan location for the outside patio. Its nice during those times of year when the weather permits.  The inside of this location is quaint and nice as well.  I might have to break out and try something else from the menu next time. It all looks pretty good!"}
{"text":"Pizza is always delicious, house Sangria is worth trying and we love the Ceasar salad along with the caprese! Yum!"}
{"text":"Pizza was OK, I'll give it a B-. Maybe it was actually a B, but the experience of eating there for the very first time was unpleasant, & left a bad taste in my mouth, in turn ruining the actual taste of the pizza.  We walk in & get the feeling that people probably end up here when the wait time at The Cheesecake Factory is 30 mins. or so.  Server was not very friendly, never refilled our drinks & seemed to lack training. Checked on our food, looked unhappy & said \"alright\" (no \"enjoy your meal\" or anything along those lines) when we didn't need anything. Not sure they require servers to have a \"pleasing personality\" here.. When we were done, somebody literally just saw us out -- no 4 word, 4 syllable \"Thank you, good night\", or anything like that. As if we went in there & spat on their pizza?  The one nice person in there was this guy that took us to our table & gave my 19+ mo. old son a piece of dough to play with. The 2nd star in this review is for him.  The pizza is only something to write home about if you're writing your family to tell them not to bother with Grimaldi's.  Grimaldi's, please invest some $ in training your staff."}
{"text":"Great pizza and always has great service. One of the only places in town I have a favorite staff member. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Only difficulty is the location. Hard to get in and out of Rainbow / 215 in general, and the parking at this place is tight. You can usually find a place over by Big O Tires next door."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Grimaldi's and I didn't realize it was a chain. I think this was the only one around, but I guess they are all over?! Anyways, I came here with a friend for lunch. She ordered us a pizza with sweet red peppers, onions and sausage. It was pretty good and fresh. I'm a sucker for fresh pizza. The service was awesome. It was on the more expensive side in my opinion, but hey, I'm a broke grad student, cut me some slack."}
{"text":"Ok so.. not shure the hype on this place..   Ordered white ricotta pizza that had I thin sun dried tomatoes -- OVERALLY Garlic I mean I am Italian and couldn't even take it had about half a slice that's all I could stomach. Overally olive oiled. I can tell you how to make a good pie. but not using any garlic or half that cause the other pizza we got was bland.   We also ordered a meat trio esk pizza -- The sauce well what sauce I could find was dolloped on sort of like the ricotta cheese on the other pizza, leaving gaps on non sauced areas near the crust making the crust actually taste burnt rather then tasting fresh.   I was actually quite disappointed to be honest. The white pizza was meh. also the pizza sauce itself had no flavor lacking salt, even Italian Seasonings.   I hope they see this. 40 something bill"}
{"text":"I would say about a 3.75 stars.....Good pizza, but not worlds best as some here are claiming.  I am not an expert on Scottsdale/Phoenix pizza, but I know Bianco would surely disagree.  It is pretty good, and the place is pretty busy.  The rest of the food is average, definitely not authentic italian in any way.    We came for a private party and it allowed us to taste many menu items because of the large orders we made.  We went away happy, and I can recommend it....but the hype is overblown."}
{"text":"They've set the bar so high for pizza, it's hard to go anywhere else. I get cravings often for it! Yum! Can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Management is constantly striving for excellence. You can see it in their work ethic, always on the floor helping cleaning and talking to their customers. Good work!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the best pizza I've ever had and I've tried a lot of pizza! I love that they have so much variety and the pizzas are a great size. The Caesar salad is really good too.  The romaine is fresh and it doesn't get soggy like some. Every time I've gone in we've been seated within 5 minutes and we've always received great service. Only downside is the parking lot is always packed and you have to drive around for awhile to get a spot."}
{"text":"Amazing hand-tossed pizza! Went here after a long night (like every night is in Vegas) and needed a hangover cure. Their pizza sizes are not like regular sized. A small sized pizza has 6 decently sized slices that are topped well! We got a small sausage and pepperoni pizza, and it was SO good! Their cheese and pizza sauce were delicious, and the oven baked thin crust was great too! It's reasonably priced too, at least compared to vegas prices. For the small pizzal with 2 toppings it was about $20. Very friendly staff, and the service was ok. Definitely suggest trying this place out!   TLDR: Good large portion pizza's at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Well...we gave it another go!  Those recent not-up-to-Grimaldi's pizzas were in fact isolated issues.  The weekend's pizza was just like the zillions we've had over the years.  This means no changes to cooking or recipes so this is just awesome news! It was also nice to hear from Josef the owner.  He was concerned."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Big pizza for the money.  A little greasy though."}
{"text":"I came across their pizza at the culinary festival a few years ago. I kept wanting to try it again, but it is a little far from my home. So I finally grabbed my wife and said \"tonight it's my night to decide where we are going to ear\".  Now we make it a point to go there once a week.   The pizza is some of the best I've ever tasted.  Not sure why or what it is about it. Maybe it is the sauce, but yet it may be the crust.  This is the type of food that your mouth waters when you think about it.  I highly recommend trying Grimaldi's. But get there early.    Sitting in the bar area is always fun too."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy, pizza! Grimaldi's is pretty much my favorite pizza place. This is a regular spot for lunch or dinner and they never disappoint.  The service is always great, all of the staff are knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. It can get busy during convention time, but rarely do I have to wait for a table.  The spinach salad with bacon is delicious. I always order a pepperoni and mushroom pizza. I've tried the calzones and those are great as well. Their crust is amazing. So you can never go wrong.  I noticed they do have some gluten free options available, so that's great for those with gluten intolerance.  Make this part of your pizza rotation!"}
{"text":"The short of it: - food is average - service is good, average prices - restaurant has a strange mildew smell  - inside Palazzo hotel  The long of it: Bland bland bland! I wanted more flavor, I kept adding salt and parmesan cheese to my food. Definitely disappointing! Secret pizza at Cosmo is way better than this place.  I started with the Caprese salad, which is huge btw. This is definitely good for two. They don't season it at all, you kind of have to just do it yourself with the balsamic vinegar, oil, salt and pepper. For pizza, they let us do half marinara and half white. Definitely thought the white pizza was lacking garlic flavor and the cheese they use is a bit rubbery. It's not that type of cheese where it has that nice stretch to it and you have to pull and pull...know what I mean??? Ugh overall, I would not come back. I'd rather have Papa John's pizza."}
{"text":"Grimaldi's is always my favorite pizza! The ingredients are super fresh and the service is always on point. We always get the Don Pizza which is a true meat lovers with tons of toppings. The Grimaldi's salad it's not your typical house version but has roasted red peppers and fresh mushrooms and amazing clean vinaigrette dressing. Robert the manager is so accommodating and made us feel like family. I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I LOVE Grimaldi's.  If it wasn't a pricey dinner every time, I'd be here all the time!  But for the cost, it's worth it. I just don't have that kind of money to spend every time.  You have the choice to build your own pizza or chose from one of their suggestions.  The small is quite large and can easily be shared between 2 people.  If you're super hungry, a large can also feed a party of 2 (with maybe 1 or 2 pieces to take home).    We always build our own pizza.  Our favorite is the \"white\" pizza - which basically means it has a lot of garlic and no red sauce on it.  I like to order: white pizza with mushrooms, pepperoni and dollops of ricotta cheese.  Perfectly delicious!  Service there is always great.    For kids, if you ask, they'll bring out pizza dough for them to play with.  Keeps them entertained for quite some time."}
{"text":"Still love this place. We came with a very large party for lunch yesterday and service was impeccable. We called ahead to warn them, so they would be able to set up a large enough area for us all to sit. When we arrived, they were the table and server were ready to take good care of us. Our party shared a variety of different pizzas, while I sadly ordered a side salad just for myself, since I was trying to save up to splurge for dinner.  The waitress was incredibly attentive, considering our very large party and multitude of different needs. We were in and out in a pretty good amount of time and there was no muss or fuss at all.   I'm still a fan of this location although I frequent the Rainbow location more because it's closer to where I live."}
{"text":"A trifecta! Three fabulous locations in Vegas! Yay!  Finally made it to the newest (and yes, closest to me) Grimaldi's location. I'll probably be frequenting this location much more often in the near the future.   This was my first time ordering pizza for carryout at Grimaldi's and I have to say it's much better to eat the pizza hot and fresh straight from the coal oven! It was just as good as always, but I missed the right out of the oven taste that Grimaldi's has. It's just better that way. Once the pizza starts cooling down, the consistency isn't at it's peak, but it's still deslish.  I have deprived myself of Grimaldi's for quite some time, so I have to say I was extremely happy with my pizza. As always, the white with ricotta and sun dried tomatoes as well as the pepperoni are my favorites. Not as big a fan of the calzones. They have some ferocious salads as well, but I usually ask them to go lighter on the oil since they are typically heavy-handed.   My FAVORITE pizza in town and a fabulous new location. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I love Grimaldi's with a passion, but not all Grimaldi's are created equal. I prefer the Silverado Ranch location to this newest addition.   This location will do in a pinch, but doesn't hold a candle to the Eastern location.   Trust me, drive the extra distance and go to the original Las Vegas location."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner with our 5 year old son while doing the Old Scottsdale touristry shopping thing. We had a Margarita pizza and bottle of wine. Both hit the spot after a long day of travel. Can't remember what our son had (probably cheese pizza.) We really enjoyed sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"Pizza was awesome. Service staff was friendly and place was very clean. i like the New York decorations and checkered table cloths.  A must goto place in Spring Val."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased since we ate at the one in Brooklyn, NY. This one deserves a 3.5 and can up the scale to the 4 level if the flavor was turned up just slightly on the pizza pie. The flavor on our sausage, pizza, and mushroom fell a little flat. I wanted pizza and beer, so at least I got that, and over all for being located inside a mall pricing was not too bad. Service was good and the atmosphere pleasant; it wasn't NY but I'll settle."}
{"text":"I love pizza, especially Grimaldi's, but the original in NY is still the best. This one did not disappoint though. We went in a Friday night with the kids around 5:30PM and had no issues with quick seating. After 6 on a weekend though it starts getting a little busier, and by the time we left there were people already waiting.   We ordered a large pizza, Caesar salad and some drinks for all of us. Nothing crazy, just the basics, so don't expect this to be in depth. Pizza arrived hot, tasty, and prepared to order. Service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Good experience in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love good pizza. I have had it in Milan, Rome, Sicily, New York, Chicago and many other cities. This is probably some the best pizza you can get this side of the Atlantic.  But it is not only the quality of the pizza. Grimaldi's is very nicely decorated, offers a good selection of wines and beers (some craft beers) and service was impeccable.  The menu is varied and the pizza was delicious. I ate more than I thought I could eat."}
{"text":"I was very happy with the pizza we ordered here and look forward to a return next trip in town. The crust is crisp, the sauce, cheese and pepperoni all tasted great. We ordered a 16\" pie for two adult and a child and it was just the right amount although I was wishing for one more slice. A truly excellent pizza at a reasonable price that is worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great white pizza.  The service was excellent. My wife ordered Bloody Mary with grey goose! It was perfect"}
{"text":"Went there at approximately 9:00 last night and had a great experience. The hostesses were very polite, I love when the staff open the doors. Granted it was later at night but the ambiance was good, waitstaff was attentive, and were very accommodating to us. We had à sleeping baby, the hostess gave us a corner table with ample room and it was a little off to the side so it wasn't too loud.  Food was yummy, had a large half white pizza and half pesto with chicken and peppers. Although both sides were good, the pesto was amazing and everyone favored the pesto side. Sangria was tasty.   Everyone had a great meal and enjoyed the experience. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Grimaldi's pizza is pretty darn good.  Chandler and Ahwatukee residents: Eat here with confidence... knowing your food will be just as good here as the Scottsdale location without too far a drive!  That said, the service was a little lacking on our most recent visit.  I think the waiter assumed we would not be tipping well because we were redeeming a free birthday pizza, so he gave us subpar service.  But why wouldn't we order a free pizza (along with our other items) if they sent it to us?  Who in their right mind turns down free food?  Of course we tipped on the pre-discounted amount, but not everyone does.  So, I understand a waiter's pre-conceived frustration.  Still, do I have to tell the waiter \"I am going to tip you X amount as long as you give us good service\" in order to receive good service?   3* for service.  4* for the pizza and the apps.  I am leaving it at a four because Grimaldi's shouldn't have to suffer because of a waiter's off night.  Still, Grimaldi's, you might want to have a little talk with your waiters about working on their poker faces; showing your disappointment all over your face when a customer presents a coupon you provided to them is not a good start to a meal."}
{"text":"3.5* but another *.5 for attentive, friendly service  I visited Grimaldi's with my daughter on Saturday (2/12) as sort of a last resort.  We were planning to try out Dozo, but my poor planning brought us to a closed-for-weekend-lunch venue more than thirty minutes from home.  Luckily DD was fine with pizza, so we found parking a couple blocks away and got a table outside (no wait).  The outdoor seating is mostly in the alley between two buildings, which causes a sort of wind tunnel.  It was chilly even with outside temps at 77 degrees.  Near the end of the meal, we did get a gas heater placed near us which was very welcomed.  The menu is simple, with calzones, pizza and salads.    We ordered a personal white with garlic pizza with 100% beef meatballs (according to the waitress) and ricotta cheese.  Yes, my daughter chose the toppings.  After ordering, the waitress brought my daughter some pizza dough to play with, which went over well (she loves doing this at Oregano's, as well).  It kept her occupied as we waited for our pizza.  The pizza arrived after about 20 minutes and it appeared even larger than the 12\" promised.  We dug in and found a crispy thin-ish crust and a very good topping ratio.  The garlic was light and enhanced the flavor of the toppings, rather than overpowering them.  All in all, a good pizza.    The waitress was friendly and visited our table just enough times to ensure my glass was always topped off.  She timed her visits perfectly, including stopping by with the check once we were clearly finished.  She was not, in any way, annoying.  That's always a plus in my book!  We had three slices of pizza left and DD asked me to bring them home \"in case we get hungry later.\"  Definitely a win from DD and I'd visit again for a quick bite."}
{"text":"It's a slice of heaven! Pizza heaven! I work in the hotel and get off pretty late but its nice to know there are a few places open to get good food at. Sure you got sushisamba but it gets pretty loud and there is grand lux but let's be honest that menu is the last thing i wanna read at the end of a long nite! If i wanted to read a novel, i'd read my harry potter books. So this place is simple and delicious. Our bartender was very patient and tentative to our every need...well to my friends every need and was he needy! We got a small pizza which was bigger than i expected! Its good for 2-3 people. We ordered the house salad which was soo good. They really made a simple salad taste scrumcious! It was one of the best house salads i've ever had. The ingredients on the pizza were fresh. Definitely a return visit soon!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue as I have been to this location numerous times, so my apologies. Recently I visited this spot to use my free birthday gift from Grimaldi's since I'm signed up on their email club. (I highly recommend it). We ordered a plain large pepperoni and large Don Pizza with green peppers and onions (our own style supreme). We also got a large Caesar salad for the table of 3 kids and 2 adults. It was a perfect size for us and there was enough for seconds. The pizzas were more than enough for us. One pizza would have sufficed but I figure with two hearty eaters (my 14 yr old son and boyfriend), it's best to play it safe. We went home with one whole pizza but I'm not complaining because who doesn't like leftover pizza? The slices were huge and very filling. We all stopped at one and a half and if we went to one of those chain spots, we'd kill a whole large ourselves. The Caesar salad was very tasty and my 4 year old even partook in it (woot woot).  Our server was a little slow at first and didn't greet us for a while and when offering a refill on the juice did not advise that its an additional charge or that the drink did not have free refills. Manager asked how everything was as we were walking out and advise food was delicious as always.  Atmosphere was very nice with all the Christmas decor, and my kids liked the chandeliers as they were bottles. This is definitely a place to go again and again."}
{"text":"Love this location, for some reason they seem to serve better tasting pizza than the other locations. They are always busy and their service is very good. Parking can be challenging at times but it is worth it.  All items are always good and fresh  One of the better pizza places in Scottsdale / Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Love their pizza. Been to the Grimaldi's at Old Town Scottsdale and here at the Scottsdale Quarter and both sites are awesome.  The times I have been here have never been to busy but not complaining hate to fight crowds and wait to be seated. Just hope they don't close up because I would have to drive to the Old Town Scottsdale location.  I love their Sausage and Mushrooms or what ever the family wants to order.  The service is generally very good and they are always there to top off your drinks.  Great location with plenty of free parking.  Will be back again to chow down on the pizza."}
{"text":"THE ORDER:  Cheese & sausage pizza  Good old fashion - plain cheese pizza    YIIIPPEEE:  The pizza was so good       We ended up ordering another 1 & driving it back to LA w us  Amazing crust       chewy & crunchy at the same time  Light cheese       normally i think more cheese the better       but I'll give them credit for having the perfect balance of toppings  Flavorfull sauce.       Just the right amount of tang, spice & salt.  Great restaurant design / layout      Bar is completly open to the outside      It's like being outdoors but without the melting 105 degree heat  BOOOO:  Eat your pizza immediately.        Looses texture when reheating        (reheated in microwave I'm sure it would have been better if we         had done it in the oven)   Pizza only        not an italian restaurant        no pasta, lasagna, parmigiana, etc.  SUMMARY A darn good New York pizza pie. Come on, we drove one 4 hours home w us. I think that says it all. This will become 1 of our Las Vegas food staples."}
{"text":"The FOOD: Margherita Pizza  YYYIIIPPPEE:  Oh so good I fantasize about it The PERFECT pizza. Real cheese not that oily manufactured goo. CRUNCH, crunch, crunch goes the crust. No sag. Not soggy. Just a tang of sauce.    BBBOOOO: Why is good pizza so hard to find. New York has ruined pizza for this LA girl. Now my husband has to cook pizza for me in the BBQ or we go to Vegas cause that's still closer than the the good ol big apple.   SUMMARY: You've gotta try it & if you are coming back to LA send me a message & please bring me some to go."}
{"text":"This place is great, but it's not your typical pizza place. We go pretty regularly and have always had great food and service. The downside is that they are usually busy.   WARNING: they do not have ranch, at all! I personally don't eat ranch in my pizza, but I know a lot of people that do. They also don't have wings.   Our favorite pizza is odd, but always great. We order red sauce, sausage, ricotta, and pesto drizzle, and they make it great. The pizza is a ha d tossed thin crust style pizza, the sauce has a great taste and they use quality ingredients. The portions are large, but the price is a little high compared to other pizza places.   The atmosphere is very comfy with dark lighting, a big bar, and the best part is you can watch them making your pizza. They toss the dough in the air, dress it up, and put it into a coal oven to cook.   Always a good bet for a date night, and since it's right next to the theatre, it's one stop shopping!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the Valley.  Make sure to try the white pizza.  I got one bad pizza and we had a work function here that wasn't well organized, but I let that slide because I like the pizza so much.  Nice and thin, charred blistery crust from the coal oven.  I prefer the bar area.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Amazing! JUST like the Manhatten location!"}
{"text":"I've been to Grimaldi's and loved them but we'd not been to this location. We were first told that we could not sit on the patio because too many people were out there (It was half full maybe). So we sat near the bar, which meant the bartender was our waiter I suppose (even though we were at a table). She took forever to come over to get even the drink order. Then we had to wave her down to get the food ordered. The salad we wanted wasn't quite what came out, but we didn't complain. The pizza was what you expect from Grimaldi's. Yummy, flat, thin and too much money."}
{"text":"Very good variety of beers, pizza or calzone are all fantastic. Not just the taste but the quality of ingredients. Service is good and might be a little slow as each order is made to your selection. There is no set menu, choose your size them select toppings, usually 3 will be plenty. Smallest size is personal ones and will not be surprised if you leave some behind or box it at the end. One of my favorite places in Vegas."}
{"text":"A Grimaldi's house salad and an 18\" mushroom and sausage pizza along with a glass of chardonnay and a beer and we were both very happy people.  Grimaldi's is the best pizza around!"}
{"text":"More of a 3.5, but after some consideration I couldn't put it at the 4 star level.  Food: Pizzas duh! There's a solid amount of choices you can make when it comes to ordering your pizza. White Sauce, Red Sauce, Garlic, etc... Plenty of different toppings that are authentic and taste amazing. I personally enjoyed the Large Red with Pepperoni and Mushrooms.  Service: Pretty standard. Waitresses were quick and friendly, didn't really have a problem with them.  Atmosphere: Legitly decorated. Feels like a nice pizza place due to it's old-school photographs and table setting. Loved it.  Price: Between the 8 guys that went there, we paid around $10-12 each for a total of 3 Large pizzas. For Vegas that's pretty good especially when you're eating specialty food!  Overall Opinion: I thought this place was pretty up to par, but honestly nothing stood out enough for me to fall in love with this place. The food is great, the service was good, the atmosphere was nice, but nothing was there that screamed out \"I GOTTA COME BACK FOR THIS\"."}
{"text":"Excellent Cesar salad.  We ordered large pizza with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese.   So delicious !  Highly recommend . Service excellent.  Highly recommend ."}
{"text":"As soon as I touched down in Vegas, my friends were craving Tacos El Gordo, so we walked all the way over there from the Venetian only to find out that it was closed! We were disappointed at first, but that disappointment disappeared as I discovered Grimaldi's was at the Grand Canal Shops on our way back to the hotel.   I wasn't able to try the Grimaldi's when I was in NYC yet, so we rallied on over for one of my best NY style pizza experiences in my life for the following reasons 1) Ingredients were delicious 2) Marinara sauce was incredible 3) Bread was light, thin, and slightly crispy around the edges.  In a way, I'm glad Tacos El Gordo wasn't available or I wouldn't have had the time to check this place out."}
{"text":"Hands-down, our favorite pizza place in Summerlin.  Period."}
{"text":"A must stop for my wife and I when we travel to Vegas together. Pizza is really good (this from a pizza snob from MA) and we really enjoy the Grimaldi house salad. We were here tonight and the service provided by Victor and Elysha was over the top. A little glitch with the delivery of the courses, but they handled it with true professionalism. The service is what has brought us back each time we are in town and tonight was no different. Kudos to the team at this location."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best pizzeria here in vegas! Pizza made fresh right where you can watch. Fresh mozzarella (not the pre-shredded), real Italian sausage, and a great ambience.  Sign up for their V.I.P club and receive a free large pizza on tour birthday!!"}
{"text":"What pizza should taste like. Friendly staff, good service and decent prices, but the pizza is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Got a cheese pizza ..the worst pizza I've  ever had..wasn't done..was real doughy. .I can't believe this place is still in business. .last time i ordered a p7zze it was burnt ...management should be fired for allowing horrible food outta the kitchen..."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  It's thin crust and that's what I like.  Great sauce and it's good cold out of the fridge.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great food and cheese cake. The GM Mike Devine was so confident that we would like the reese cheese cake he offered to pay for it if we didn't like it. Well, he didn't have to pay because we ate the whole thing.  Thanks Grimaldis"}
{"text":"Very... Very good Pizza.   We had the 12 in pizza.   Excellent crust.   Friendly server.   A+++ for this place.  I am going back soon"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PIZZA!!  Seriously, if you like thin, new york style pizza, COME HERE!!! Originally from Brooklyn, this might be as close to the 'real thing' as it gets this side of the rockies......  I'm speaking on behalf of my husband as welll, who lived in New York and is VERY picky about his pizza. He LOVED it! Now, for my pizza, I ordered it without cheese (not by choice :(  ) and it was still outrageous!!! The ingredients were fresh and the crust was divinely crispy. As for the pizza with cheese (as it should be, I know) they use fresh mozzarella, and it didn't looked smothered by it either.  I love their outdoor patio.....it's a cute little courtyard, nice and shady....looks like little Italy. :)  When my next pizza craving strikes, I know where I'm headed!"}
{"text":"Do you know how mind-blowingly happy I was to have this pizza!    Grimaldi's is the pizza place that you will travel to although its completely out of the way because of the quality of the product.  My best friend and I split a Mushroom with Ham pizza with white sauce.  Every bite was a tribute to deliciousness.  To top off the perfect experience the server was not just attentive but offered great info on what we were eating.  We finished off the meal with what has become something that my stomach actually calls our for since our last visit, the Butterscotch Toffee Cheesecake.  This cake was one to savor. I double checked my fork to make sure I didn't miss anything when I pulled it from my mouth  So so good.  The server was kind enough to inform me that my drive would be cut short soon as they are opening a Grimaldi's ten minutes from where I reside.  The planned site is south Rainbow, right next to the Hooters place.  I can't wait. Pass the word as it should be open by March I hear."}
{"text":"When I think pizza, I think Grimaldis.  In my opinion, per what I've tasted so far in the Las Vegas valley, it ranks as the best.  I'm not sure what makes it so good but having great service on top of it all is a cut above.  I usually have the garlic pizza with ham and I get hungry even writing this review. Not to be a one trick pony, their desserts are something to write home about as well.  They have this seasonal butterscotch cheesecake which is absolutely phenomenal and not to be missed if you hear the waiter say that it is available."}
{"text":"Service was great. Super friendly, super helpful. Food was even better. Beware when getting a large pizza. It's REALLY big!!!"}
{"text":"I think the food is OK, but overpriced. I also think Grimaldi's is over rated. When a friend wants to go I will go, but I don't say let's go..."}
{"text":"Wow, that New York-style thin crust! It is the most crispy thin crust I have ever had... and I've had my fair share of pizzas. The toppings are fresh and plenty, especially the jalapenos that we had in our calzone. They were sweet and spicy! Definitely going to eat at Grimaldi's again, but probably will go to their location on the Las Vegas Strip in the Palazzo."}
