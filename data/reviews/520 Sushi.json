{"text":"Love this place, owner and staff are good. Service during busy times is usually good and the sushi is usually fantastic, along with the butterfly cheese wontons and the sashimi (just ask for sliced lemons on the side) definitely great money's worth for the quality and quantity . Great holiday spot too!"}
{"text":"The yam tumpura rolls were sooo goodd!!! Def must try!"}
{"text":"Some servers are so rude! ( one literally rolled her eyes at me. And that hostess with her hair hanging all over the place will she leans against the cook counter?? Need some recommendations for a new sushi place!! And the menu seemed to have things missing and the butterfly cheese is awful now?? There is no cheese??"}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi place I've been to. Left less than half of our food back and got yelled at. The customer service sucked, was not polite at all.  I've been to other sushi places and never experienced anything for leaving food back. The waitress did not come back to refills our drinks or asked to pick up our plates.  Also stated us right in the face and would not come over when we called.  Overall, I would not recommend this place the food was not that good either.  Paid too much to experience the worst service ever."}
{"text":"This sushi place is delicious.  I am a repeat customer whether it is for the all you can eat or just picking something up for takeout. All the food is super fresh and it has a HUGE menu.  The appetizer chips, edemami,  dynamite rolls,  spicy salmon rolls,  spicy tuna rolls and chicken teriyaki are just a few of my favourites.  They have been super accommodating for me in the past and the service is exceptional.  I HIGHLY recommend!  Best sushi place in Brampton by far. If you haven't tried it yet I don't know what you are waiting for."}
{"text":"My all time favourite sushi spot! I don't even live in Brampton any more but I still come here because I'm never disappointed. Quality of the sushi is good, the service is great, it gets packed sometimes but the seating arrangement is still comfortable so no complaints. Love the butterfly cheese in the end (haven't found another sushi place that has it). I also appreciate the variety- sushi, wings, noodles etc. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The place is an average- sized restaurant and like many of the upcoming ayce sushi places, they've started using iPad menus. Their weekend lunch price for adults is $13.99 which is really good in my opinion (my boyfriend and I ate on a Sunday). For apps, I would HIGHLY recommend their butterfly cheese. It's AMAZEBALLS!! They also have this app called SPICY SALMON ON CHIPS. It's basically spicy salmon topped on a sour cream and onion flavoured Pringle. You would think it sounds strange but when my boyfriend and I ordered it out of curiosity, it was something we didn't regret! It was a pretty creative and tasty dish if you ask me. Their sushi was very fresh though their sushi rice was more on the sticky side but I quickly forget that fact when eating their seafood. And out of all the ayce sushi places I've been to, they have THE BEST bbq eel fried rice. Usually, that dish would taste and smell really fishy that I can never finish the small portion. But 520 does a really good job making it! Kudos to the chef!   The only downside would be that I don't think they have enough staff to accommodate all the patrons that flood the place. Their gaining a very good rep but I don't think their staff can keep up at such a small number. Another thing is that we keep getting food we didn't order... But then again, why would we complain about that, right? 4 spicy salmon rolls!! I would definitely come back for more :D"}
{"text":"This place is legit . Good service , friendly . Yeah they brought me someone else's order a couple times so there is room for improvement but the service was friendly and prompt . The food was great , salmon rose , tempura eggplant and tempura mushroom are some of my favs . Atmosphere is simple modern , not trying to hard or tacky but also not super upscale. Had a great night . Would do it again no questions ."}
{"text":"The iPad menu is a great idea for an all you can eat sushi restaurant, especially when you don't know exactly what each different type of roll is made of. The quality of the food is very good."}
{"text":"Average at best.  Been to several ayce sushi places and this one  is fine but nothing great.  Three of us for lunch at 2:30 pm.  but because lunch is over at  3:20 we had to get the dinner prices or be out in 30 minutes.....stupid considering the place was 3/4 empty.  Bill was $90 for 3 (no beverages).  Sushi and sashimi was good. Many rolls to choose from.  Soups  were not hot and nothing special in the flavour department.  Everything was fine but nothing that I would bothering rushing back for.   Service was seriously lacking - just toss stuff on the table and walk away.   'Spoon and fork' is  far far  better."}
{"text":"We love this place and better than other all you can eat Sushi restaurant in Brampton.  This is our usual Sunday lunch restaurant after church, we've been coming for years and still love it."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the host and overall service.We asked to be seated at the boot but was told no because it was reserved. We picked another table and was again refused. We spend one hour in the restaurant and no one arrived for those seats. The host lied and when asked why she gave us a bag of bull. Food was average and service very poor."}
{"text":"Two of us went for lunch on 29th December at 12:45pm. Restaurant was packed and we had to wait for few mins before getting our table. Wait wasn't bad at all.  After getting our table I ordered Miso soup and veg salad rightaway using their iPad menu, which was pretty cool. My miso soup came right away but beg salad didn't show up.  I kept on ordering some sushi and hand rolls for two of us. Half of the food never showed up on our table. My friend asked me to order the same sushi again, which I did and after waiting for sometime sushi came. Though my first order never came.  I complained to the server and she said they are busy, food will be coming shortly. But it never came.  I asked for diet coke and water. It didn't come. I asked again and this time it came.  I asked for wasabi and ginger three times to three different people. Finally at 3rd time it came.  Most of servers are girls and were not paying attention to order. One male server got my ginger and wasabi right away.  Food was alright but service was highly disappointing.   My friend has been there many times and never had bad experience. My first time wasn't good.   I would want to give them benefit of doubt as they were busy. But bad service can't be pardoned by me.   If you are planning to go, make sure they are not too busy."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but NOTHING in comparison to the service. The service was down right terrible. The server was not polite at all, did not even bother to collect our empty plates and stated that we must finish everything on our plates before she could take them. Having four of us at a table there was sometimes 1/4th of our food left over with some dishes, some less than that and some none at all (which I believe is normal for an all you can eat/tasting menu restaurant)  The server refused to move our plates and on top of that gave us attitude and dirty looks. At multiple occasions we had to wave her down from where she was standing in the corner talking to her coworker. We did not feel welcome at ALL in that environment. Definitely do not recommend this place to anyone especially since there are comparable all you can eat sushi places in the surrounding area. That was the first and last time ill ever go there. Take my advice and don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Service was great. It begins and ends there.  Went at lunch and made a few orders with some friends. Chicken Teriyaki on the images looked grilled (as with any place) but here it was this grey matter. The plate was warmer than the chicken itself, so clearly it was microwaved.   Next came the tempura. Wow. Mushrooms were clearly not washed before cooking as you could literally taste and see dirt in them as they were bit into. The crab tempura was poor-quality imitation crab meat. While I know most/all crab in sushi restaurants are imitation this was poor quality at best.  Then came the sushi. Let's try to forget about this shall we? Thin, sad, cold pieces with little to no flavour tainted the experience that was already poor. The lunch price is beginning to make sense for the rest of us.   Service however was great. Staff was friendly, nice, attentive, and always quick on the orders. Such a shame the food was not nearly up to par."}
{"text":"I mean, there's not very good sushi restaurants in Brampton. This is one of the few that's pretty good and one that I prefer.  The ordering system with the ipad is very convenient, the prices are decent (the same as any other sushi buffet out there) and the food comes out pretty quickly. Servers are attentive to your needs too, like refilling water and clearing out your table.  Not much to say about this place really but it has cheese wontons if you look for that at a sushi bar!"}
{"text":"Great menu with just enough options to choose from but not overwhelming on an easy to use order system via iPad. Quaint atmosphere and great service! My favourite was the green tea ice cream and beef short ribs."}
{"text":"Finally after reading all the reviews, I encountered the dreaded...get out pressure. Refused to serve us unless we gave them back the ipad.  The lady at the cash is the root of the problem. Already told them I won't be back. Recommend  avoid. 168 sushi on Kennedy has picked up their sox. Better over this place, more selection also."}
{"text":"I have never enjoyed this restaurant, even when it was called Akita. Obviously, some customers disagree with me; however, I have found the food to be second rate and the alcoholic drinks to be overpriced. The food price is relatively low and the quality of the food reflects this. I have no problem with Ipad Menus, as they are in use by several restaurants. On the other hand,  Ipads are no substitute for so so food.   One other quibble is with the urinal in the men's room. The space is so narrow, that I do not want to use it."}
{"text":"The Sushi was good. I liked that it was all you can eat. I've had better sushi upstate ny. Overall , I would come here again"}
{"text":"I ordered from here the other day with the skip the dishes app. I ordered California rolls and deep friend California rolls with a side dish of beef fried rice, I spent like 40.00 and the food was awful. It ended up in the trash can. The deep fried rolls were oily and tasted like they have been sitting in oil all day. I would never order from here again."}
{"text":"Never went here when it was the home of Akita but 520 met/exceeded our expectations.  The food was excellent.  We noticed the little details like the crispyness of the seaweed wrapping the handrolls, the pleasant hint of rice vinegar in the sushi rice, the thin batter coating on tempura.  Service was very good.  We ordered everything wirelessly/paperless using a ruggedized tablet placed at our table.  We added new items (and seconds) during our meal.  We got everything we ordered.  Only one nitpick that won't affect my rating:  using plus or minus buttons is a little slow when ordering sashimi (i.e., by piece).  Food service and cleanup was prompt -- never felt like we were waiting long for food to arrive, or empty dishes piling up.  Price:  typical for AYCE; very reasonable for kids (e.g., 4 y.o. was $5 and 7 y.o. was $10).  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with my boys and it was good.  This place isn't amazing to me but it's not bad.  For the lunch menu they have your basic rolls, sushi, teppanyaki, fried dishes, etc.    Service was good, the food came out at a steady pace and the empty dishes were cleared when done.  Drinks were tipped off when needed.  If you want a full belly for a good price, can't go wrong with AYCE sushi lunch."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi usually sacrifices quality for quantity, but 520 is surprisingly good... it's definitely  my go to Brampton spot. Something noteworthy is the udon.. AYCE sushi spots usually don't do a very good job with udon but 520 surpasses the others. The staff is very nice and the food comes quick!"}
{"text":"Did not enjoy any part of my meal. The food quality left much to be desired. Priced at the average AYCE sushi price range, the quality of food were substandard and the selections limited. There was no one part of the meal that stood out, the sushi offerings itself was boring and lacked proper preparation; the rice was unevenly cooked with some grains undercooked. The kitchen food, too, was limited. The only aspect of the restaurant that struck me was their turtle tank in the foyer which kept me quite entertained and dulled to pain of my reluctance to pay the bill. Overall, food taste and quality as well as service were all mediocre, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"3*? Wow this place is great! Maybe not a perfect place; after all it's all you can eat! But def. one of the better sushi joints in Brampton. So upon entrance there is a massive fish tank with far too many fish! But it is not as tacky as the million origami swans they hang from The ceiling. It may not be the best decor but it is very clean and workers are always cleaning any tables they walk by (very hardworking staff a they look tired lol) so we asked to sit in a booth but the booth nazi said no booth and sat us in the centre with the only people in the restaurant!? Makes no sense, no one was in the booth. Next time I'll just walk out to prove a point!  You order your food from an iPad menu. Great way to keep track of your prior order. FYI lunch menu has no sashimi to order. There are many choices. From tempura, hand rolls, apps, noodle dishes, rice, tofu, maki, sushi, soup, fried, the lists goes on they even have chicken wings lol suits everyone's liking even those who don't like fish ~ try their mushroom wrapped beef! So good  the fish is cut perfect and the right temp to boot! Give it a try, better option to red lobster next door lol (check out my red lobster review haha what a to-do!  Tips: ask for more wasabi and ginger! So skimpy!  You can get ice cream after your meal! Not on menu"}
{"text":"Came here with a large party of 25 people or so during Sunday lunch service.  The place was packed.  We had reservations from 12pm to 2pm.  On this day, the restaurant also had a large reservation beginning at 3pm.  Thus, there was a time limit for our party.  As with most AYCE sushi places, you order via a tablet.  The tablet has pictures and names of the item, you click on it and you get a more detailed description.  You then pick how much you want to order of said item.  After, you click the icon named \"order\" at the top of the tablet.  Very easy ordering system.  The AYCE price includes one pop per person.  They have Coke and Nestea.  I'm sure they have other pop, but this is what my table ordered.  You order your drink directly with the server rather than on the tablet.  The variety of dishes available at lunch is limited.  There is no sashimi, which is expected.  However, there also isn't any chicken wings, ribs, stir fried items, seaweed salad, I can't name them all, but it was noticeable that the variety offered on the menu is not as extensive as other AYCE restaurants.  I liked several things about this place though.  First, I like the fact that all items are small sample  plates.  Even if you go with just one person, you would be able to try a lot of the items on the menu due to the small sizes.  The rolls were not overly filled with rice.  I had some favourites as well, I really enjoyed the beef terikayi.  I also enjoyed the shrimp tempura, mushroom tempura, the cheese wonton and the beef fried rice.  What I did not particularly enjoy is the quality and freshness of the actual seafood, which is important because this is a sushi restaurant.   The service was quick, we did not have to wait long for the delivery of food.  You can keep track if they delivered the item to you on the tablet.  I did order the beef teriyaki twice and didn't receive yet, but the tablet said I did, so maybe it got lost amongst the tables, given our party size.    Approximately 15 minutes prior to 2pm, the servers took away the tablet.  I advised them that I had outstanding orders.  They took the dessert orders and delivered the ordered items and dessert in a timely manner.  I may try this place again, although I am not compelled to do so, mostly because of the quality and freshness of the actual fish.  However, there are some redeeming menu items.  Average quality overall."}
{"text":"I was not really impressed by anything. The decor was nice, I guess. The service was competent. Their \"butterfly cheese\" appetizer was pretty delicious, though that isn't exactly what I was there for.  The sushi itself was not presented as nice as I'm used to and just seemed kind of... lacklustre. Even the Miso soup was mildly tasteless. I had dinner here on a weekday and left feeling kind of upset I'd just spent as much as I did for such a \"Meh\" experience. There are certainly better options for sushi in Brampton. I'm glad I finally tried this place out but I highly doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Closest all you can eat sushi, I'd come here. Affordable, fish is good, I stopped getting the deep fried butterfly cheese because there's basically was no cheese in the oily deep fried wonton wrapper. Love the sushi, the handrolls, the maki, sometimes the teriyaki beef is overcooked, but I always look forward to the deep fried banana with my red bean ice cream. The interior is absolutely cute with the origami cranes, it's clean and doesn't feel claustrophobic. All time best in Brampton for me."}
{"text":"So went here again to see if they have improved.. unfortunately they haven't selection of food is still the same there's not much..   We got her around 4 so it was just the start of dinner.. And they started off strong we got our orders correct but then dinner crowd came and it's like they got scared and stop paying attention we got the wrong order and some of the dishes we ordered didn't even come..  I would say the only thing I like on their menu is the butterfly cheese wonton that's the only thing I thought was better compared to other AYCE sushi places.. And they have increased their price..  They still need to work on the speed and accuracy of people's order cause I'll be honest if I was an rude customer I wouldn't be saying the nicest things and walk out of the restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of sushi, I can't say it was terrible, but I also can say I liked it. The meat was good."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a excellent meal here and being all you can eat I tried a good variety of different rolls. It wasn't too busy and service was pretty good. I would definitely come back if I ever get the chance to be in this area again."}
{"text":"At $15 for lunch AYCE, 520's prices are fairly standard for the average AYCE sushi establishment.   I visited with a fairly large group during weekday lunch hours and the restaurant was pretty busy. However, this didn't stop orders from being fulfilled in a timely fashion. For the most part, orders came out in good time. I especially liked the fact that iPads were utilized to facilitate the ordering process, and this really maximized wait staff efficiency.  The menu options were standard for AYCE sushi for the most part - nothing that really stood out. If I were to pick my favourite dish, it would have to be the fried salmon belly - this was delicious.   Their actual maki rolls were nothing to write home about - not better nor worse than the typical AYCE sushi place.  Overall, this is a solid place to go for a good meal. There's nothing special about this place though - no wow factor, so don't go expecting the world."}
{"text":"Granted I'm from out of town but the food here is pretty good! Selection is decent and I like that the portions are small enough that when u order, u can try a little of everything and not get charged extra. Service was prompt and friendly enough."}
{"text":"Another oddly-named 3-digit sushi place (see 168 Sushi). The food is very good. The service is average, as is the price. The location is better than 168 but 168 is my place and 520 isn't remarkable enough in any way to win away my frequent business."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot only thing is that i feel their fried rice and noodle soups / udon/ soba broth tastes the same and too sweet. Good service, the ladies are very polite and not rude and monotone like some other well known ayce sushi places."}
{"text":"Probably the best eat-all-you-can sushi place I've been to. They serve lunch til about 3pm (14.99). The venture starts with a friendly receptionist handing you an iPad containing the unbelievably vast menu. You start ordering and your food comes in a steady flow which keeps the eating momentum going. You can order whatever you want, whenever you feel like ordering it.  Whats so freaking great about this restaurant is that you never feel rushed to finish even if youre obviously in idle mode to make room for more yummy Japanese food.  My favorite is the cold tofu and spicy salmon sushi. There's also free can of soda and dessert with every order.  I would gladly go back and binge on sushi."}
{"text":"This place is not bad. fair price and pretty good food! been here 3 times"}
{"text":"I have eaten here once since the ownership and name changed (It was formerly Akita). Some of the food was fine, but the teriyaki sauce on a couple of items I tried did not appeal to me. Many dishes seemed to be designed to fill you up with rice rather than more expensive ingredients. Beer and alcohol were too expensive.   I did ask the significance of the name 520 and was told that the Chinese pronouncement of 520 sounded like the Chinese phrase for I Love You. In my own case, I found nothing to love about this restaurant."}
{"text":"My thoughts on this place are mixed. The food is great but they bring it out so fast it makes you wonder about the preparation quality. The staff, as I've seen another reviewer report make it a little uncomfortable. They'll ask you a question, then speak in Japanese to eachother and laugh, then sit there and stare at you and other tables laughing to eachother. I even saw a couple waitresses physically pointing at guests and laughing. Completely awkward and unprofessional. I've never experienced such a creepy atmosphere in an establishment before. I don't recommend just for that reason alone."}
{"text":"it is very rare to find me at an AYCE sushi spot because  A) I'm allergic to shellfish and B) I don't eat sushi, even if it's shellfish free.  That being said, I've been craving AYCE sushi because I can eat all the other food that is not sushi lol.  It was our friend's birthday so my girlfriends and I decided to treat him.  I've surprisingly been to 520 before (not by choice) so I kind of knew what they were about.  I just remembered the cheese wontons and that's basically all I wanted lol.  However, this time around they weren't so great. Hmph!  They didn't have as much cheese as I would've hoped for in them.  Highlight would definitely be the beef ribs.  Oh Jesus, these things are amazing.  You literally get one piece when you order, so order lots!  I ate these things like chips.  So tender and filled with flavour.  Beef udon soup was nothing special.  Hot and sour soup was good and not too salty. Fried banana was delicious with the ice cream but i defs should've gotten more than one piece.  They had already taken away the ipad and I was too lazy to ask for another lol.  My friend loves chocolate ice cream and they had it here.  Apparently that's rare, so FYI!!  Service is QUICK here. Like instant.  Everything comes out super fast as soon as you hit 'confirm'.  So if you come hungry, you won't starve waiting for your food."}
{"text":"I went to this \"all you can eat,\" sushi restaurant and this is not the 1st time going. You can say I am a regular and  today I had enough. The food is delicious but customer service was by far the worst I had ever experienced in my life. They always mix up orders, they constantly come around to fill your tea and water and they stop bringing your orders when they feel that it's time for you to go. When we tried to explain how we felt about our overall experience, the \"manager\" did not care and her exact words were \"well you still have to pay\".... On top of that my sister tried to tell the lady at the front register that she needed to charge her for a beverage that they missed to communicate. The lady was very rude and had no interest to listen and then realized that she forgot to charge her and started to get very unprofessional. She changed the subject on another customer who walked out because that's how bad there service was. Get your act together 520Sushi because I don't think anyone would tolerate such service."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Modern decor. The food is not up to par. Very plain in flavour and or flavour which does not belong to the plate itself. I wanted to throw up the piece if Maki roll I had. They had a mixture of mayo in everything, it was very distinct."}
{"text":"Came back with my sister, the food is awful! Cooked food is drown in teriyaki sauce, so sweet and salty! Can't even eat! I usually finish all my food, but I just couldn't! Sushi is nothing special. The broth for noodles has changed to tasteless. At the end they told me that I have too much left over, they won't charge me this time but next time they will.  I just paid and left . First of all, how can you eat when the food is awful?! Second , there won't be a next time!"}
{"text":"They spoiled lastly. Waiting time is incredible, bringing half of ordered sushi. Sitting for 2 hours and still hungry."}
{"text":"Nothing was bad here. Nothing was excellent. I feel like everything from the sushi, to the soup, to the curry, to the cheese wontons, was all minimal flavor...almost like everything was watered down to save money or something. Sad because I saw potential in everything."}
{"text":"I heard stories about this location but I tell you, this place has never disappointed me. Well, in terms of food that is. Service was ok. Some are better than the others. They weren't rude or anything. But they weren't pleasant either."}
{"text":"The service was really great, all the servers were so friendly and extremely attentive. Our glasses were never less than half full, that is why I'm giving it 4 stars. I still prefer Hockey Sushi and maybe even 168's dinner AYCE sushi over this place but it was hard to dislike it because of how nice the service was. The sashimi was cut thin here but it was VERY good. I also loved their salmon sushi and my boyfriend loved the cheese dumplings with lemon sauce. Some of their rolls have a lot of rice in them. I didn't particularly love the specialty rolls but I really enjoyed the salmon and avacodo roll!  Overall I'm glad I tried 520 sushi and it is extremely close to me."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok here.  What I didn't like was the feeling they gave trying to rush you out. It was busy but there were at least 5 empty tables... yet they made people wait to be seated.  Those tables were not reserved so it dis not make sense.  Grilled veggie selection was very minimal.  1 whole eggplant to be exact.    Limited sushi, sashimi and rolls... compared to other AYCE places.  Good thing is their tea and water service... they constantly come by to refill your glass... even if it is not low or empty.  perhaps its to encourage you to drink more and fill up?  Who knows. LOL"}
{"text":"Ordered via Skip the dishes for a friend & I - quite disappointed really. The hand rolls took forever to bite into because the seaweed wrap  just wouldn't break. The sushi was all over the place & the comp miso soup spilled everywhere - so the meal didn't taste pleasant at all. I'll stick to my usual sushi place."}
{"text":"Decided to come back to this place after year and my experience is pretty much the same as my first visit. I don't hate it - I just prefer more menu selection so I opt for other sushi AYCE.   What really disappointed me is that they don't have surf clams for sashimi and whenever I go for AYCE sushi I MUST! have surf clams.. They offer surf clam sushi though which isn't really the same :P The other thing is that the portion of the sashimi were so tiny .....It was like the size of a loonie lol. It didn't bother me as much since its an AYCE restaurant but literally my boyfriend and I ordered 50 orders of salmon sashimi alone and usually 20 pieces at any other AYCE is our maximum. Their food is just like any other average AYCE - nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either.   The service is okay - its really a hit and miss depending on your server. Not surprising though that servers at AYCE sushi restaurants always look so miserable, so it doesn't really bother me.   I probably won't be returning anytime soon just because there are other sushi restaurants in the area that offer a lot more selection, which I feel is more worthy my $$$."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times, the food isn't bad at all. The service is just weird.. They stare and watch you eat sometimes, and it's quite uncomfortable. I like the seaweed salad, and the Makeral sashimi. I wish they had more options, as other sushi restaurants, but the list is simple. I still will come here, but I will most likely turn towards sushi house, for the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"good fresh sushi. they serve the food out quite fast. alcoholic beverages are simple, wine, beer sake. wide variety. but could be better service by the waitresses."}
{"text":"We ordered take out tonight via \"skip the dishes\" app.  Our order was ready when we arrived. When we got the food home our order was accurate. We were given the correct amount of chopsticks and lots of napkins. Our food was packed neatly.  We ordered four sets of rolls. Cucumber. Chicken Teriyaki. Philadelphia rolls. Shrimp Tempura Rolls.  All the rolls were well made. The salmon in the Philadelphia rolls was nice and fresh.  The only short falls were that the cream cheese portions in the Philadelphia rolls was somewhat uneven so some of the rolls had a huge chunk and some of the rolls had barely any.  The shrimp tempura rolls had a lot of tempura batter so when you put it in your mouth it was very dry and difficult to eat.  But other than those two tiny short comings everything was tasty. We will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"520 (I love you)   Apparently certain combinations of numbers mean certain phrases, as I recently learned by reading the menu at 520. I really enjoyed their salmon sushi and their phili rolls are amazing. Not to mention their salmon rose rolls are also really good. The service was great, I never had to ask for a water refill because the staff was definitely on that. If you like deep fried things, I definitely recommend trying the \"butterfly cheese\". Overall a solid AYCE restaurant. Nothing overly spectacular but I would come here again for sure.   Needless to say my gf and I were talking in numbers the whole way home.  \"I 520 you baby\"   ;)   Fun place for a date."}
{"text":"The food is decent nothing special, the greeter at the counter was very laid back and unprefessional. No one explained how to order off the ipads, but with a few minutes of fiddling it's quite an easy ui. We were served at a decent rate, and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi is great, not a whole lot of selection on the lunch menu, if you want more go for the dinner menu (after 3pm). The deep-fried butterfly cheese is amazing! Overall the sushi is on par with every other AYCE sushi restaurant for $15.  I highly recommend"}
{"text":"It was good experience. I would definitely return. I usually go for sushi in Mississauga as a Brampton resident. Reasons to return are; the food just taste just as good as any other sushi joints. I do like the eggplant, it was a big portion and the way they grilled it and have it lathered in light sauce was good. The mushroom wrapped in beef was good too! It wasn't too chewy. The shrimp tempura was good, fairly battered shrimp. The green dragon roll could use mango sauce. The fried tofu was nice, crispy outside and soft inside. Other sushi places I've been to over cook their tofu. The curry chicken wasn't too flavourful, bland. The spring roll was okay, taste like something you'd eat from Ocean's. The other maki rolls I've tried like Las Vegas roll, mango roll, and golden dragon roll were pretty good. The service was pretty good. Though some of the dishes are a hit and miss, I'd return again."}
{"text":"Didn't like the service. I liked the food but they ruined the experience when they refused to give me my drink while I was paying, although it was included in my launch receipt. Soooo cheap treatment!!"}
{"text":"Good variety of food, the iPad is quite useful.   Wait staff aren't attentive, sashimi and sushi came out super late, and I was advised by a rude waitress that I should \"order ice cream at the end\", after she had to bring me new chopsticks because she cleared my place setting when I wasn't done. I think I can order ice cream and enjoy what I want WHEN I want."}
