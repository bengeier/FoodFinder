{"text":"I always love buffet's and Hometown rarely disappoints...but this one is one of those rare instances.  For one thing...it seats about 200 people, and has enough food for about 40. For whatever reason, the actual buffet area is about 15'X20'. It's incredibly small with a small variety of food. Also, the food that is there isn't great even by buffet standards. The fries were undercooked and cold, the carrot cake had some sort of whipped, non-cream cheese frosting that ruined the whole cake, and the chicken soup was among the worst I've ever had.    If you want a good buffet in a fairly close by area, there are two Old Country buffet's within a 10mi radius and both have much more food to  choose from, and better quality of food.  UPDATE: Also had minor food poisoning the day after eating here, no joke. Stay away. Stay far far away."}
{"text":"Many people, especially foodies, scoff at chain restaurants like HomeTown Buffet. However, every now and then, my family likes to enjoy simple, comfort food that's easy on the wallet. So off we went to HomeTown Buffet for Mother's Day special lunch last year. And were not disappointed.   They pulled out all the stops for the Mother's Day special. The salad bar was fairly extensive with lots of greens and thoughtful salad topping options like roasted sunflower seeds and cranberries. For mains, in addition to HomeTown's reliably solid fried chicken, both butterfly shrimp and popcorn shrimp were also fresh and flavorful. Roast beef was quite pleasant as well and not at all dry. The only quibble about the entire meal: the \"steak\" was basically a hamburger patty but that's to be expected from a meal costing about $13 per person--and, it must be noted, even that was well-seasoned.   Mini skillet of warm brownie with hot fudge sauce made for some delightful dessert. And as alway, HomeTown's simplified, no-nonsense take on carrot cake while not as rich and luxurious as what you would get elsewhere was perfectly acceptable and remarkably delicious nonetheless."}
{"text":"I love a good buffet!  This one has many selections to choose from.  You can have all the steak you want - no limits there.  Fried shrimp, chicken & dumplings, salads, desserts.  Yum-o!  This is a very traditional American style buffet.  Adults Dinner pricing is approx. $10.99 per person - not too shabby.  Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"My mom wanted to go to The Hometown Buffet for Mother's Day, so I treated her to dinner here. We went early, to avoid the expected crowd. But to our surprise, it didn't get as crowded as we thought it would be.  The line moved fast, and a few empty tables remained throughout our visit there. The food wasn't that great, but the Staff was friendly (but a bit laxed with removing used plates and cups from our table, during the first hour of our visit).  We were shocked that they had rare cooked steak, at the Buffet--especially since the media said there is danger in eating undercooked meat.  The ham and turkey was OK, but the fried and baked chicken wasn't that good. And they didn't have a lot of chicken wings on the Buffet (which is always a favorite of Buffet lovers).  The side dishes-- Mac and Cheese, Green Beans, Corn, Mashed Potatoes and Gravy, etc was acceptable. We didn't care for the small fried fish, or the baked fish.  The fried Shrimp was good, but they didn't have any Peel-And-Eat Shrimp. The Salad Bar was OK, except the Staff was slow to replace items on the Buffet, once they ran out of them.  The coffee was delicious, the hot tea was a generic brand, the soda selection could have been better, and the Staff was slow to refill the sweetened iced tea. I was surprised that they offered a nice selection of Frozen Icee drinks, and they were delicious!!!  The Dessert Bar contained Cinnamon Rolls, Brownies, Ice Cream, Build-Your-Own-Sundaes, Coconut Pie, Bread Pudding with Raisins,  Sugar and Chocolate Chip Cookies.  However, they did not have any fruit on the Buffet. And they only offered one type of Dinner Rolls--which were undercooked, mushy, and heavily buttered.  The Build-Your-Own Nacho Bowl, Taco, and Tortilla Chip Bar was the best and most tastiest items in the restaurant.  The downside of our visit, was when a unidentified guest pulled the Fire Alarm. The Staff said everything was OK, and no one needed to exit the building. The alarm roared for a very long time, and was very loud and annoying. It took a while for the Fire Department to come, turn it off, and reset it."}
{"text":"Ew, expensive and disgusting.  Place actually smelled musty and the food selection was just WRONG.  I knew I should have walked out when they wanted $30 for dinner.  BLAH  Don't go here."}
{"text":"Truly a guilty pleasure. I love the salad bar (it always has chick peas). I certainly have a weak spot for the meatloaf and the sweet ketchup sauce, in fact it my favorite meatloaf in town. Do I always end up with heart burn? You bet! Will I come back again (mostly cause the 6'-5\" teen boy always asks)? Of course!"}
{"text":"Good food selections, quality and cleanliness. Definitely worth visiting. Reasonably priced with friendly service."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting it was dirty and gross the manager even came by our table but no one picked up the sausage that was next to our table the entire time we were there we watched person after person walk over the sausage some even stepping on it."}
{"text":"One time my friend ate a ton of salt here and barfed all over the place."}
{"text":"For those that like an abundance of mediocre food that is poorly cooked than this is the place to be. For those that actually like good food I would suggest another restaurant and preferably not a chain.    The only saving grace was the frozen yogurt and the fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Okay, let's be real and fair. The place is about as good as a truck stop. No offense to truckers. The dining room needs a major overhaul. The food can be best described as deep fried this and canned that. There are a few saving graces. The chicken, fried and baked, is actually moist and tasty. The steak is fairly good. The desserts are good. The service? Well, I've never actually had someone come to my table but the cashiers each time have been very friendly and welcoming.  Keep your expectations low and you'll enjoy dining here."}
{"text":"I go here solely for the fried chicken and chicken tenders, with sides of mashed potatoes with gravy and stuffing. The yeast rolls are nicely honey buttered. The salad and fruit bar is really good too.  But the other choices don't interest me. The dessert are not too good except the ice cream."}
{"text":"If you want disgusting food, it can be had much more cheaply. Or for free, out of a trash bin. I suppose if you're only eating once in a while and need to stuff yourself when you do then this place is passable. Personally, I'd rather skip a meal than go here. And yes, American buffets are infamously bad, but even so this place is terrible, and rather dirty. You're better off going into [whatever supermarket is in that plaza now] and buying some food there."}
{"text":"Horrible food quality, the place has really declined over the years in quality while the price remains the same.   The variety was limited for it being a Friday night.  I was embarrassed for bringing my girlfriend to this place as her first American food experience.  The food was not well stocked, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This was the worst buffet ever.  We went there for the breakfast buffet and there was no food on the buffet. The manager and the cashier said there was no help there. Okay whose fault is that.  Got a refund and left."}
{"text":"Ahhhhh, \"The land of &\" A meal & a heart attack, or 1000 cc's of insulin.   Never was a fan of Old Country Buffet, but the new revamp has brought some life into this old staple.   It's still full of Blue Hairs and people who sport clothes that are covered w/ stains and holes. Also, if you are rotund like I am, your self-esteem will be boosted when you realize no matter how fat you are, their is always someone fatter at the Hometown Buffet.   Food choices here are awesome. Mexican, American, Italian.... all piping hot and ready to pig on. The salad bar has surprisingly fresh veggies and staff works hard to keep the place clean and well stocked. Too bad every freakin kid in the place has to touch everything, wipe their hands on their nose, then bare hand the items.   I even saw the staff kick some woman out for filling up an old \"Country Crock\" container w/ chicken wings. I guess takeout isn't allowed. LOL   Good desert choices too. Soft serve and the usual box-made cakes and pies. The quality of the food won't win any awards. Not nearly as good as a freshly prepared 5 star meal, but better than prison. What do you expect for $9.95?"}
{"text":"I generally enjoy a buffet of this nature. A wide variety so everyone gets what they want. Plus, a great dessert when you are almost too full to eat anymore.   However,  when we walked in I walked passed 12 dirty tables with piles of plates on each one. With kids I would have preferred a table closer you the buffet and front door.   Oh and please clean your bathrooms.. Preform a bathroom check on a regular basis (every 15 minutes or hourly at the least). After getting off work, picking up kids, and finally getting to the restaurant I had no choice but to use your restroom. They were NASTY. The smell, broken toilet,  and the other two or three working toilets were filled with poop inside AND out.   Had I not already paid I would have left. My stomach turned and I didn't even have an appetite after my experience.  During our meal none of our plates were removed.   My family of four will not be returning to this restaurant at all. I will spend money at a place that cares about hospitality."}
{"text":"None of the food is fresh, almost all of the plates and silverware are dirty, the tables are filthy and sticky, and most of the food looks poorly made. A disappointing, overpriced experience."}
{"text":"My sometime guilty pleasure.  It's got a nice salad bar and taco station with fresco salsa.  You can get away with eating moderately healthy here so long as you avoid the 'American' stations of red meat and dishes lather in butter.  Their deserts are pretty good with many toppings at the soft serve stations.   The clientele leaves little to be desired.  Only come here for pure gluttony but nothing else."}
{"text":"Eh... I have been dragged here multiple times...and I never want to go back again.  To be a little  fair to Hometown..eating as much low-quality food at the cheapest price you can get it ..is not not my idea of a good time.  That being said their food is just icky...and the crowds here are usually iffy too.  You will be surrounded by people that brought all 7 of their kids there for dinner..and those kids will be running all over this place screaming....And the food looks like it has been sitting around forever ...bland and tasteless... Ick....the whole thing just equals a poor dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday lunch/dinner. Restaurant was filthy. The spoons to dish out the food were never changed. Every time new food came out the same nasty spoon went back in the dish. At least I didn't get sick.   Definitely not worth the money or the chance of getting sick!  On a different note: Other customers were very rude, not sure why.   And funny story (if your still reading): I saw this one couple who went to the dessert area with a huge dinner plate and took all the small plates that the cakes were on and started dumping and piling on all kinds of desserts on their large dinner plates and left all the little cake plates on the counter empty. I was trying to get a piece and all the plates were empty. (They had a ton of dessert, I kid u not) I felt bad for the lady fishing everything out so I told them, (as if they didn't already know) \"I think your supposed to take the plates,\" and they just laughed."}
{"text":"Good: large variety of food and desserts. All of which was good :-) Bad: the carpet was nasty, dirty, stained, and  smelled :-( I like the restaurant, but next time I will look for a different cleaner location."}
{"text":"Out of 5 stars..I would give this place a -12. We passed by an old country buffet today and were talking about how we used to go there when we were little. We looked up online and saw hometown buffet was the same according to the website. So we gave it a shot.  Horrible mistake. We got there at 7:20 and the lady at the counter said \"you know, we close at 8\", we asked if it was too late to be seated, she said no so we sat. We started looking around at the food. Everything looked like it came straight out of a can. There was a carving station with no knife that looked as if it had been sitting there for days, hospital looking green beans, mashed potatoes, corn,carrots, and some other mystery items (honestly we had a long discussion about what they could be and nothing had a sign). I grabbed a couple things and some chicken nuggets. Everything tasted disgusting except the chicken nuggets(it was clear they were previously frozen). I decided to go back to get some salad, I figured that was safe at least. It was 7:30 and they had already pulled all the salad items to put away. I managed to grab some lettuce before they took it to the kitchen. The lettuce was sitting in water and when I got back to the table noticed most of it was brown (ate some). I figured I would grab some chocolate lava cake quickly before they pulled that too. It was horrible. It tasted like a cardboard flavored sponge, my fiance said it tasted like..a$$.  Now, here's the best part... I walk into the bathroom. All the stalls look like they had been kicked in, out of the 4, 2 were out of order and locked from the inside. 1 of the 2 open ones was clogged and someone left a very nice number 2 for all to see, I went into my last option...THERE WAS FREAKING BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE!!! It seriously looked like a crime scene. It was all over the toilet, smeared on the stall walls, and all over the floor. I was horrified! I obviously didn't use the restroom and didn't know if I should go home and shower or attempt to wash my hands. 2 of the 3 sinks we're broken, literally missing parts, and one hand dryers was hanging off the wall, the other had already fallen to the floor.  How DARE these owners allow their bathrooms to get to this point, and how is this place still in business? I would NEVER go there again."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but nothing to write home about. I don't expect much out of a buffet because it's just a bunch of food slapped down on a plate. Of course the quality won't be excellent. It fills me up at least and their selection is usually solid.  The place is kind of dirty. Most of the food areas have stuff spread out and remnants all over the trays and ground. The tables are almost always sticky. They definitely could keep up the place a little better. Also, why is the entrance passage way a mile long?"}
{"text":"I love buffets but this place has gone down hill. I was never really that crazy about this place but it went from about a 2.5 to a 1 since the last time I was here. Mac an cheese was watery, chicken alfredo was blah. Nothing was \"bad\" it just was not good. They had some enchiladas that looked like they were from a TV dinner..  I managed to find some fish and some smoked sausage that were decent and ended up eating mostly salad as it was fresh. I would not recommend going here and I will not be back anytime soon.."}
{"text":"I have been to this hometown buffet multiple times, a lot for family holidays. Recently we moved to California, went to a hometown buffet here, and were severely disappointed. Hopefully we won't get food poisoning, but it isn't looking very promising I wanted to write a review on the Madison one since it is sooo much better.   First off, great selection of food! Beyond great. I don't think I have tasted something I didn't like. We normally always have the same waiter, his name is Carlos, and he is great! The manager Tony is THE BEST! Seriously! I miss going to this place."}
{"text":"I know I was here years ago and it was not bad. But, OH MY GOD!!! Whoever is running this business has to deliberately running it into the ground. They must be in hot water with the IRS or something. There has to be some reason, some meaning to this restaurant still being open. Granted all the others are closed, but why in Gods name is this one still open. Look, I can eat. I'm not a little girl. I can eat Totino's frozen pizza for Christ's sake. I could not  down this if they paid me. Run, don't walk. I never like buffet's but this is horrible. The closest I ever came to liking a buffet was lubbys and I don't care if old people went. It was pretty good but those days are gone. Run away...Run away..."}
{"text":"I'm still waiting to contract salmonella or bird flu from the warmed over, heat-lamp-lit, community-sized tubs o' food.  Fortunately that has not happened yet.  All I could think about during my running race were dancing sausages and galloping bacon strips greeting me at the finish line.  So of course that prompted me to desire unlimited amounts of each, which led us to Hometown Buffet.  I wanted classy, so we went to the Hometown Buffet in Scottsdale.  I dragged my friends here kicking and screaming.  The pancakes were disgusting and bland.  Didn't have the French toast but it was visibly crusty and overcooked.  Hash browns were ok.  Orange juice was the worst watered down crap I have ever had.  The eggs?  I wouldn't even think of it.   The crowd and decor?  Just what you would think.  Large and in charge baby.  And old too.  Our weights and ages combined were about 200 pound lighter and 20 years younger than any other party there.  With all due respect, our sweaty, race-weary table probably smelled the worst.  I knew what I was getting into, but I wanted unlimited bacon and sausage - which along with the fried chicken were good, btw. And there you have it."}
{"text":"I love the Mac n cheese. But the last time I went, I grabbed a chocolate cake. When I took my first bite, I was hard! And the cheese cake was not good either."}
{"text":"Old Country Buffet is above average as far as American buffets go. If you're in the mood for it, it's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I've always thought of Hometown Buffet as a glorified dorm cafeteria. Since sophomore year at Illinois, I'd make the trek out to Hometown if I felt in the mood for all-you-can eat, American style buffet.  There aren't many gems in this place, but there sure are a TON of options. I've never left this place feeling like I should've ate more. I haven't really enjoyed any of the special nights, but I suppose when your'e in the mood for some food without strings attached, this is the place to go.  There are other places that I prefer on most days, but I've never been disappointed by Hometown Buffet."}
{"text":"I used to be a 'regular\" but my  circumstances have changed that. I think they try really hard.  The servers and staff are very friendly. It is disappointing when they stop serving favorites like: Bean soup on Thursday; fudge; sweet potatoes. The honeydew melon is always good. Breakfast isnt bad, if you have your eggs prepared fresh for you.   We like to eat breakfast there instead of the Ryans because they have toasters, and Ryans does not. It is a good value when you  have a coupon."}
{"text":"When I was a kid, I loved going to hometown buffet at least back then the food was awesome! last year, my mom and i went there the food was great. we went there yesterday evening for a late bday for her and the food was freakin nasty! something i ate made me go to the bathroom almost twice!  i noticed the seating was very low not that many customers. the bathroom (womens) was horrible! there is one lady who looks new is super friendly with long hair in a ponytail. she goes above and beyond not so much the other staff will do that. i don't know what is going on with hometown buffet but it looks like they don't care. i agree with someone on here said the cooking speaks otherwise!  i couldn't finish my 2nd plate of food it was that bad the only thing was good is the dessert. i hate to say this but i would rather not go to hometown buffet anymore.  i dont know why my mom chooses to go there (oh wait its cheap) but there are better restaurants.  in 96 or 97, my parents had their sphagetti and it made them sick! the food didn't do anything to me. i told my mom why go back when it made you sick? makes no sense to me."}
{"text":"I went to this location Christmas day. I arrived at 3:pm. After paying I went to get my food. The buffet was out of turkey and ham.with only about 3 more slices of roast beef left. I was informed that no new food would be brought out. The restaurant closed at five. I could not believe they would not bring out any new food with 2 hours remaining before closing. I asked for my money back and left. Now I know where the Scrooge lives, Hometown Buffet Mentor."}
{"text":"So many error made by the cashier but the manager fixed it up quickly (without a receipt though as I would have liked). The foods were a-okay. I didn't each much. The quality didn't seem that great and there was only pineapple served as fruits (no melons, no watermelon, etc.) The salad was sparse. Other reviewers were right- foods were salty though I think mostly with seafood.  Eh.  Oh and I ended up with diarrhea for the next 24 hours. Some people in my group did, too. Not sure what it was in their foods that caused such indigestion."}
{"text":"Okay selection of hot and cold stations for a buffet restaurant that is near the interstate and right in the middle of nowhere. The sweet station made my day - frozen yogurt."}
{"text":"Sub par food and average service.   Most of the food is very dry and kind of old but the fried chicken is pretty good. Hash browns are also decent. I would stay away from the sausage, meat looks pretty fishy to me.   The cleanliness could definitely be better, especially the bathrooms and floors near the salad area. There was a little overflowing water on the floor at the salad bar when I last went around May 2015.  Service is ok, considering the cheap price. Wait times are also pretty low, you get seated within 2-3 minutes max.   Overall a solid two star."}
{"text":"Ewwwww.  My grandpa practically lives here (hello, embodying stereotype).  Hometown Buffet is inherently depressing if only based upon the clientele -- it's all the town's elderly and low-income folks plus country hicks that make the drive special just for hometown.  I felt inappropriately dressed, as we were heading to a Christmas party after and my jeans + heels + blouse made me feel like I was begging for attention or something (for the record, I was underdressed for the party.  Can't win 'em all).  Jodi is the sweetest in the world. She always takes care of my grandpa.  It's not that the food is horrible, it's just that it is what it is and the ambiance doesn't help it any.  We always humor him when we're in town, but if it weren't for that I wouldn't dream of stepping foot in this place."}
{"text":"Went here last week for the first time in years. Seems like this place is not as well maintained as it was in the past. They also now charge for drinks."}
{"text":"Ughhhh...drive by it! I should've kept driving.  Went here out of desperation.  I had just driven 3 hours to visit my sibling.  It reminds you of Old Country Buffet. But the food looked like it had been sitting there for 12 hours under the heat lamps.  The chicken had a rubber like texture and was salty.  Actually all the food was salty.  The drinking cups look like they've been used since 1970.  They are old, faded and grungy.  The horrific part is the bathroom. They clearly don't clean the place. And the back of the toilets have dried up poop stains.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"I am glad that this place is closed because the food was terrible and the bathroom floor was yucky. I won't be returning  to the HomeTown Buffet anymore poor service."}
{"text":"We went here Thanksgiving Day and arrived at 3pm and the restaurant said they would be open until 4:30pm. There wasn't any turkey or ham left at the carving station and I asked the employee if they would be bringing out any more meat and he said \"No\".  I told my boyfriend this information and he was as upset as I was.  It was our understanding that they would be keeping the food options full until they closed. My guy asked to speak with the Manager, Calvin Williams, to get his money REFUNDED to him.  BAAAHUMBUG and shame on you, Hometown Buffet"}
{"text":"I've been going to this location to eat lunch on random weekdays for the last 15 years.  In short, this place is solid.  It isn't fancy, but it is certainly no dump.  It's a nice clean place with good service where you can feast on pretty much unlimited food for a very low price.  For those who haven't been here before, the restaurant is predominantly self-service in that you check in when you walk in by paying for your meal up front.  You then get a table, and go straight to the buffet.  A waiter/waitress comes by occasionally to pick up your dishes.  It's nice in that it's convenient to eat here and you can get your food right away.    Cuisine usually varies but includes standard American fare, Mexican and Italian.  The salad bar and dessert section always tend to be well stocked.  The food tends to be fresh, and tasty.  Given the price, quality and variety of food, I think this place is an excellent value.  It's certainly good for families and kids.  For those who haven't been, I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"When gramps said we (me, him and dad) were going here on Christmas Day, I spent the past four days despairing the idea. Seeing a year's worth of 1-star reviews didn't help my negative attitude going into this festive meal, either. I was fully planning on adding my own snarky one-star review to this place after I vomited up whatever I happened to ingest here, however I'm giving as optimistic of a two-star review as I can.  First off, don't kid yourself. The food is as bad as all the reviews here say. They did have some decent turkey they were slicing up, though, and i had some rice that appeared to be the only side item not swimming in goo.   And yes, the bathrooms are as disgusting as other reviewers have mentioned. Nearly the entire men's room floor was wet and there were no less than three wet floor signs in there. Hazmat suit recommended.  However, I bumped this to a 2 - more like a 2.5 - because the poor Christmas-day staff was straight busting ass to keep the overflowing crowd stuffed full of breaded cardboard-like substances, and they were doing a fine job of reaching that goal. The manager was being as nice as he could to his employees while they were all no doubt pretty bummed out about constantly refilling the buffet trays for thankless guests on Christmas day. The other staff members were also doing the best they could to pretend to be happy around the guests. So for their effort and their ability to grin-and-bear it with the best of them, I just couldn't give them a one-star review."}
{"text":"The interior could use some updating, here's tears in some of the seats.  The bathrooms are typically low on supplies.   There's often two to three items I'm unable to eat because it tastes room temperature. There's been food items that have been freshly placed on the buffet and have tasted lukewarm. I like the variety of options at a buffet, but temperature is important to me.  I've never understood the additional charge for a beverage. Why isn't it included in the buffet pricing?  I'm unable to locate pricing on the webpage.  The employees are pleasant and helpful. The deserts are yummy. The ice cream machine has been down on several visits. One time, it was vanilla ice cream with orange sherbet twist as the only option. I would come more often if there was some improvements to the place. I love the fried chicken"}
{"text":"Run of the mill American Buffet.  Good value and selection.  Will return in the future."}
{"text":"So this is a typical buffet.   Wide selection of food and it was decent.   They had a good spread for Thanksgiving with all the typical food and sweets.   I would not be a regular, but when I am looking for a huge meal that is decently priced, I will visit Hometown again.   Since I visited on Thanksgiving the place was packed.      The staff did a great job keeping the buffet well stocked and I was seated in about 10 miniutes."}
{"text":"What happened here? I guess I shouldn't come to expect much from a chain buffet? Wait what about Golden Corral? Oh that's right Madison doesn't have one. This place is a sad excuse for a buffet.   Go somewhere else and get a real meal."}
{"text":"What happened here? Selection used to be good.  It's your basic breakfast selections-waffles, pancake, bacon, sausage, and omelette station.  Salad and pastry selection."}
{"text":"I echo everything that was said before me. This place is pretty terrible. I've been to Hometown Buffet in other cities and they weren't too bad. I mean, we're not talking gourmet meals here, just a filling buffet filled with 'Merican style food.   This location has done everything wrong. First off, just the fact that there are never any cars out front should tell you that there is a problem but secondly, the food was terrible. It looked pretty much the same going in as it did coming out and it didn't taste much better (okay, to be fair, I didn't taste it the second time). Most everything was cold and tasteless and the textures left much to be desired.  Additionally, for a buffet there was very little to choose from. Since I ended up spending most of the rest of my day \"experiencing\" Hometown Buffet over and over again, I can honestly say that I've had enough to last a lifetime.  If you respect yourself you will avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"Ick ick ICK.  I don't usually do buffets and this is why:  1. The ick factor is high when I see congealed food sitting in its fat or grease for who knows how long.  2. Even the veggies look like they would clog your arteries.  3. I never feel like I get my money's worth because I can only gobble up 1 1/2 plates before feeling too stuffed to eat another tasteless bite.  4. Food is watered down, greasy, soggy, and bland.  5. Clean is something that never seems to be found at places such as these, particularly when I see flies making themselves at home on everything laid out on counters.   True to form, Hometown Buffet hit all of the checkpoints I listed above and I left feeling guilty that I wasted someone else's money eating at this nasty place.    Eeek!  Methinks not is completely an accurate statement."}
{"text":"First Dimitri's and now HTB? Is there a bug at Midtown Center?  I preferred Hometown Buffet in Hilltop Plaza, but it looks like the Hometown Buffet franchise may be in jeopardy because of Golden Corral. I was at GC in Brooklyn once and I liked their atmosphere...something Hometown Buffet didn't think of.  I hope HomeTown Buffet comes back in Cuyahoga County though...and even stronger than before!"}
{"text":"Went back because why not torture one's self with buffet food? Food is still just ok, and much of it was either out too long, or just scary. It's most likely the cook staff is untrained and/or doesn't care. Broken ice cream machine is not acceptable.  Place was clean at least. Brice the manager is awesome! Molly, the well don't know what title to use since server isn't right, was very friendly and attentive, if not overworked."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  A buffet.  Hadn't been to one in almost 30 years when I went with my grandparents to one in what is now South Beach, Miami (back then it was just a blue-haired desert next to the ocean).  The food was decent, the prices cheap, and you could eat as much as you want.    It gets a 3 star as a buffet.  I'm not comparing it to a real sit-down restaurant.  The kids loved it."}
{"text":"Same old same old with this place  The service is nice for I mean the one person that you interact with when you pay for the lunch special.  Literally all the courses you see you could argue have been just sitting their since this morning.  Now I know what your thinking what do you expect with a buffet, but their just has to be better standards.  Besides the free drink that comes for the price no real other reason to eat here ever again.  The place is very dark and gloomy and I felt like I was seeing the sun for the first time after coming out of the place and only being their for 30 minutes.  Sorry no bueno stay away!"}
{"text":"I was watching a show on cable which talked about what became of  the food left over from the buffets in Vegas. It was interesting and informative, yet at the same time kind of disgusting.   To simplify, the food was hauled away by a pig farmer and fed to his pigs which would later be used for slaughter.  Personally, I think some of the refuse was sent back to Mentor and served here.   The place is dirty. It is absolutely disgusting. The only thing I have seen recently that was worse, was the bathroom.  The servers were nice, as well as most of the staff, but the food reminded me of an old joke, \"It tasted like framunda cheese!\" I won't ruin the joke, not to mention this is a family website, but the subtle hint I am about to give is, its in the region below my hips and above my knees(if you still don't know, friend me and i'll tell you).  About the prices, not expensive but aside from making yourself sick as you slide on up to the food trough, the food is generally overcooked, dried out and heavy on the salt and or MSG.  The floor is dirty, the plates are old, haggered, crack and chipped, just like the plastic cups. And if you dared look under the table(WARNING DON\"T), you'll lose your appetite.  I don't want to come across as the most negative person in the world, for I have come back to this place more then once(when i was feeling like a pig), but there are some good points.  For example: If you are ever feeling sad or blue, and really down on yourself come to this place, Look around at the people who haven't showered in days. Or the few who have skid marks which can be seen through the tent sized yoga pants, and almost instantaneously  you will feel much better about yourself.  See, everyplace has it's purpose"}
{"text":"Disgusting food, disgusting desserts.   It's all superficial here - everything looks good until you take a bite out of it. The pastas and noodles were overcooked and oversauced, the fried foods (you usually can't go wrong with those) were good until I bit into one that was all breading and oil, and the mac n' cheese didn't fail to disappoint.  The desserts were bitter or plain disgusting and the soft serve ice cream was icy and cheap tasting. The cookies, which looked really good - did not live up to their looks.  I do give Hometown Buffet two stars however, for their dinner rolls and mushrooms. THOSE, well... Those were pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Definitely a last resort. Came here on a whim to see what they had to offer; I wasn't impressed. The food was very limited in options and not very well cooked, extending  into the dessert selections, which were actually O.K, but again not very diverse or well prepared. I'm not coming back even for free."}
{"text":"I do not understand the poor reviews. Every time we've eaten here it's been fine. Clean, well stocked. It must have changed hands or something."}
{"text":"It's old country buffet, what do you expect?  Lots of different stuff to choose from, and definitely caters to those who want to eat themselves into bland oblivion.  If you go here looking for exotic, flavorful, unusual cuisine skillfully prepared by a fantastic chef you must be well deluded."}
{"text":"$11 for dinner. Cheap typical american buffet fare. Not much more to say.  Highs: + Fried chicken + Mac & Cheese + Biscuits and gravy + Fudge cake!  Lows: - Gross popcorn shrimp - Dry pot roast - Sad selection of fruit (just cantaloupe and canned peaches/oranges)"}
{"text":"I will be working on a contract in Mentor, Ohio for six months so my mom and I made a quick run from the Detroit area to check out Mentor.  Max & Erma's was really busy so we decided to check out the Home Town Buffet which was on the other side of the parking lot. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality and selection of food.    Everything was plentiful, at the right temperature and tasted good.  There was a wide selection of quality food.  Usually the steak is not of good quality at a buffet but the steak here was cooked and seasoned well...I loved it!   I also had fried chicken...excellent again.  What I really liked was home-made desserts like carrot cake and banana pudding, it was moist and delicious.   Overall, a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Walked in.  For one senior, three adults, and four kids they were going to charge us $75.  We turned around and walked out.  Plus the kid working the register was rude to my father-in-law.  Mahalo, and avoid."}
{"text":"This buffest reminded me of a Las Vegas buffet except all the food gave me heartburn.  I'd been to a hometown buffet before so when my bf suggested it I relied on my memory of the experience and agreed to go.  Unfortunately my memory must have been jilted by the occasion or this Hometown Buffet was just bad, I dont know.  what I do know is that the food is cheap, about 10$ per person.  It is also soft.  And by this i mean everything is overcooked.  And it all gave me heartburn that lasted all day.  So will I be back?  Maybe in about 10 years when I've forgotten about this experience."}
{"text":"Tonight I had the misfortune of visiting this HomeTown Buffet. Now HomeTown Buffet is not gourmet dining, and I knew that going in, but I've never had a problem eating at these type of places until tonight.   Well tonight, it was so bad, I got a refund before touching the food. I walked in, paid, and went into the restroom to wash up. It had a heavy perfume of urine. Not appetizing.   I came out and thought about bailing but I was so hungry, I went ahead and tried to find something to eat. Nothing remotely appealing. The salad bar was practically empty. Each item had about 1 foot of ice between it and the next item. On one 8 foot long area of the salad bar, there were only about 7-8 items. The hot food also looked terrible.   I've been to a Home Town buffet dozens of times over the last decade and know what to expect, and this one is far below par. I asked one of the hostesses for the manager. He came over and I told him I changed my mind and I want a refund. He didn't even ask why, but cheerfully refunded my money.   If you want to go to a decent example of this type of restaurant, try the Old Country Buffet on Metro Center Parkway. It's incredibly hard to believe these two restaurants are owned by the same company. Maybe they are franchises ? I don't know, but the Home Town Buffet on Scottsdale Road is a dump. Avoid at all costs. And someone should call the health department. If the bathroom is that nasty, I'd hate to see the kitchen."}
{"text":"They have an Icee machine with blue, red, and coke icees, which my son loved!  Good place to take a picky toddler to eat where there are lots of choices. Otherwise, I'd skip it. The food is pretty bland and although there is a good selection, not as many healthy options as I'd like to see."}
{"text":"Stab me in the face..... This is a disgrace to the word, FOOD."}
{"text":"Sick is the only word to describe. This place made me want to call a health inspector right away. The place smelled strongly of cleaning fluid when I entered, but the place was filthy....how does that happen? My daughter has been begging to go here, but I don't remember it being so bad. There was food all over the floor, spill signs everywhere, trash, dirty tables, etc. I ate some chicken that was goodish, I had some more and spit it out cuz it was pinkish inside. I was scared of the shrimp. The salad bar was horrendous. Yellow-brown iceberg with warmish veggies and dressings. ..yum sounds so good. coagulated mac and cheese and burned pizza. The stuff looks like its been sitting there since 1991. Dirty plates, silverware, walls, floors, everything! Nobody bussed our table, 6 dirty plates and not one of them moved. Coke was out, ice ran out, cups ran out. I have never felt so dirty after going to a restaurant, I need a shower. I can see, however, by the clientele that this is up to some peoples' standards. A guy walked next to me, dropped his straw, left it, said oh well and got a new one. I think the bum sitting next to me was the cleanest one, since he licked his plate and stacked them neatly. The food here is just gross, all fried, canned, and bagged and probably unsafe. I would rather go to Golden Corral or Sweet tomatoes. Never again, Hometown. Never."}
{"text":"I usually go weekend around 10:30 for a brunch which i can try both breakfast and lunch. But ever since I had golden corral in chicago, hometown is not as good"}
{"text":"Pretty good for breakfast, not so good the rest of the day. Great place to feed a bunch of people cheaply, but ya get what ya pay for."}
{"text":"It's a buffet...if you're expecting world class food then of course you're going to disappointed. The meal was cheap, the food was ok, and it filled me up. What else can you ask for from a buffet style restaurant?  I was starving and staying right next to it, so it was an easy choice."}
{"text":"It's a dump, the food would be right at home in a prison.  We paid, looked at the food and not one thing looked good.  Went back to the cashier for our full refund.  Bye bye and never again."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning here and was sick for hours after I ate.  No thank you!"}
{"text":"The only thing i liked was the waffle fries and ranch. Overpriced gutbusting dreck. I convince myself to come back every year or so and always regret it a few bites in. Cleaner than Ryans ythough."}
{"text":"My daughter was demanding that I take her and her brother out to dinner one fine day last week.  Well, she usually prefers Double Dragon Buffet, but I have eaten there so many times that I have lost count.  So I said, \"We're going to Hometown Buffet!\"  On our way there, my daughter asked me if I'd ever eaten at Hometown Buffet and I replied, \"Yes, many times.\"  I used to eat here with my family on Sundays back when it was Duff's and also when it became Hometown Buffet.    In high school, my best friend's dad got food poisoning here from Turkey ON THANKSGIVING, so I vowed never to go here again.  Well, I broke my promise to myself.  On this trip, there were not many people in the place, including employees.  There were like three people running the front and I heard dishes clanging in the back and someone had to be cooking.  So there were maybe five people on hand.  It cost $24 for my two kids and I.  The food selection was decent and included typical American fare - steak, potatoes, green beans, corn, mashed potatoes, chicken, pizza, and mac n cheese, to name a few.  There were also several desserts.  The presentation of the food was not impressive, but it was warm!  The desserts were pretty tasty, actually.  They had an ice cream dispenser too.  I had some steak, potatoes, corn, and green beans and it was definitely a solid okay.  Nothing to write home about.  But the buffet was so messy!  There was no one cleaning it and the food did not get stirred or refreshed much.  I can't say I recommend eating here, considering the other buffets nearby that offer superior taste, service, and food quality for the same price."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the food variety, food quality and general cleanliness that had been somewhat of a hallmark here has not been seen for several months. We've sporadically stopped in hoping for the best, but it continues to go in the wrong direction. This time a food handler, who was wiping down the salad bar, kept dragging her cloth over the top of the food items!  It is sad to see a place go downhill."}
{"text":"First of all.. we go in and no one is at the register.  Then someone comes and does not even great us.  Once paid we look at the selection and where very disappointed.  The food was very bland to just awful.  I have been to other Hometown locations, this one was the worse.  Golden Corral is much better!"}
{"text":"Arrived just in time for changeover to dinner. Strike one - they had a rep from the Plain Dealer in their lobby, hustling for subscriptions. Strike two - The roast beef, stringy, gristly and rather inedible but for a few bites once you tore the waste away. Strike three - Tater tots? Oooh I like tots. They were lukewarm, at best. I told the buffet kid they were bad and instead of checking the temp with a thermometer etc, or getting new ones, he put his (gloved) hands on them in a few places to see if they were hot. They had broccoli cheese casserole and .... something gravy covered, pot roast maybe, in those individual \"pans\" that looked as if it had been there for too long. It might have been \"at temp\" but it was dry to the point that the gravy had that \"crust\" on it. No thanks. So I told the manager who was apologetic, and he gave me $10 cash back off of a bill that including pre-paid tip was $35.  I will not be going back to this place. Here's what I really don't understand. Hometown buffet and Ryan's are owned by the same group. I've never ever had a bad experience at a Ryan's. I guess it's like when a hotel corporation owns several brands... some are economy and some are higher end. What I know is that I won't be spending my hard-earned dollars at another Hometown. This was the last chance."}
{"text":"All you can eat for under $10........what is there to complain about?? If you want junk food and you want lots of it oh this is THE place to go!  You've got several hungry mouths to feed and  not that much $$ in the wallet....then this is THE place to go. Other than that I'm not sure why you would go here...."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for her birthday dinner cause its where she wanted to go and we havent been there in a while.  I don't know if it was the over burnt roast beef, the under cooked chicken, or the shoe leather they tried to pass off as steak, but coming back here after 8 months left a very bad taste in my mouth. My family and I use to come here all the time when I was younger and the food was great, the atmosphere was wonderful and the staff was very friendly.  This use to be the place to be, now I would gladly spend the extra $3 and waist the gas to go to a different golden buffet (Golden Corral).  Do not waist your time and money on this place anymore, Trust me I won't.  I would rather eat out of the dumpster behind Taco Bell than ever eat at this Hometown buffet again.  You have lost a lifetime customer, and anytime your name comes up in conversation, I may just puke."}
{"text":"For $7 including tax during the weekday, this is a good value.  The crappy breakfast I had at the Waffle House the other morning cost more than this.  My meal included corned beef hash, french toast, sausage, sauted mushrooms and onions, along with an assortment of fruit, coffee, and orange juice.  The selection was not super extensive, but all the basics were there with a few nice extras.  The service was attentive and friendly, food decent.  There were a dozen or so regular/old-timers in the place, in addition to myself.  I must confess however, that there IS a dark side to the Hometown Buffet.  When I walked in, there was great deal of consternation over the state of the bacon -- tragically the latest batch had been overcooked. It was overly crisp, *not* tender and juicy.    The manager who greeted me informed me of this and I was assured that fresh bacon would be out shortly.     Thereafter, I continued to hear assorted bacon-related grumblings from the old timers.   Fortunately, no full scale bacon riots erupted during the remainder of my visit.    Do you like bacon?"}
{"text":"The selection is just crap and doesn't even look appetizing so I ask my self Why is it every time I come here the food is never fresh and the place just looks dirty. I keep telling them and I keep trying to give them a chance to surprise me but today I just can't even eat this old food. I am getting a refund as I haven't even touched the food"}
{"text":"If you are into buffets, try them out.  Food is diverse.  Food is hot .  Good flavor.  It's good for a family of picky eaters."}
{"text":"Restaurant review I agree this place has taken a change for the worst. We went for lunch this past Sunday. Somehow there was sections of the buffet that had no food. The popular parts of the salad bar stood empty for the entire meal. The fruit plates were also empty for most of the meal and only refilled toward the end. Lunch time options is abysmal due to cost cutting there was only fried chicken, orange chicken, a pulled pork sandwich, and taco bar. There was also chicken pot pie, but again this was out for a prolong period of time. You had customers standing by the buffet table complaining about getting a refund. On top of all this the ice cream machine is broken and the one that was working had vanilla flavor only. No sugar free option. Overall the value of eating here has gone down significantly. I will not be back.  Pros: none  Cons: lot of empty spaces for food, slow food preparation, very limited options at lunch, broken ice cream machine  Hidden deals: Sign up for the email club for BOGO coupons and free birthday meal"}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen. Time was this buffet was plentiful with good choices. Now even the early birds have deserted this coop.   The salad lettuce was browning -- the garland around the fruit bar looked fresher. The pastas were cold except the mac and cheese which was tolerable. I think they had pizza -- it was round with a cheese-like substance on it, but I couldn't confirm for you if it had been baked. The fried chicken and fish sat in their grease, drowning slowly from neglect.  No one was at the carving stations and there were no knives to carve the roast and ham yourself. Eventually when we found someone else being served from the station, my wife and daughter formed a line, and then were treated rudely as if the carver had better things to do than serve them.  The only saving grace were the desserts. Let's just say if the ice cream machine wasn't working there would have been a riot.  Salad: 1/5 Chicken: 1/5 Mashed potatoes and gravy: 2/5 Corn and veggies: 3/5 Pizza: 1/5 Mac and cheese: 3/5 Spaghetti: 1/5 Rolls: 3/5 Ham: 3/5 Roast Beef: 1/5  Chocolate fudge/lava cake: 3/5 Strawberry/cherry cake: 3/5 Ice cream: 3/5 Rice Krispie treat: 3/5  Clean: 2/5 Service: 1/5 Fresh: 1/5"}
{"text":"Easter dinner was not NEARLY as good this year as last. Prime rib was wierd texture. No horseradish for the beef. No ham every time we went up. Blah."}
