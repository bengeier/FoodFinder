{"text":"I go here all the time for dinner with my family. They recently renovated to expand the location and it looks amazing. One of the best chinese restaurants I've been to in terms of decor and food.  I usually get the Eel Fried Rice and the Crab Salad...can't remember if those are the exact dish names.  Dynasty Cuisine at Commerce Gate is pretty good too. I found a deal on HungryBuy.com for a full meal. Check it out."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Congee Queen at least 3 times a month when I worked close by. I hadn't had the food there for over a year and decided to take my family here since I was selfishly craving it myself.   Portion sizes are great for sharing with a large family. We a family size seafood soup. Should have gone with the smaller size because we ended up taking half of it home. It was really good! For our dinner we ordered a ton of dishes. Lobster, done the traditional way with green onion, Mango chicken and shrimp dish - unique flavour combo - we enjoyed it. Seafood chow mein, general Tao chicken, fried chilli turnip patties, spice and pepper salt squid, snow peas with garlic sauce -  everything was amazing. We had lots to take home for lunch the next day.   One star lost only because they had forgotten one dish and they had to make it after all the others had arrived. When it did arrive it was good anyhow, but would have been nice if if arrived with everything else."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding.  The Congee we ordered (Scallops/Shrimp and BeanCurd/Corn) had just the right amount of salt and the scallops weren't the cheap Bay variety.    The food was cooked to perfection.  We continued with a good (but not great) Beef with Chinese Broccoli but a great Cantonese seafood crispy noodles.   It is old style type of cooking, Chinese comfort food that reminds me of some of the great Chinese restaurants my parents took me to when I was a kid.   If you want a stylish, sublime Chinese food experience, go elsewhere.  This is old school flavors that long time admirers of the genre will appreciate.     BTW: Seating is at a premium, there is a reason why this place is ALWAYS packed.  If this place has a reputation, it is rightfully deserved."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner around 6pm. It was packed 20 min wait at the door. We mistakenly ordered crispy chicken with secret sauce thinking it was going to be like sweet and sour chicken. It was more like roasted chicken. We won't make that mistake again the manager was friendly about taking it back no problem. We order calamari, sweet and sour chicken, tiger shrimp chow mein and beef fried rice with black bean sauce $1.75 extra to make it fried rice vs steam. 4 stars for sure!! It was fast service excellent food quality and cost was not high but affordable, good portions to share with family or friends."}
{"text":"is \"OK\" it's not bas but not great either, their Chefs in this location, are not as tasty, crunchy, fresh, or delicious as their counterparts from the other branches. So, paying premium price for So So quality is not very satisfying, knowing their other branches deliver better quality for the same price. Still taste better than food court, but below par compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Good portion of food, found it bland Chicken was undercooked.  Service was dismal. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food especially on week days when there are free drinks involved. Good priced, affordable. The price has increased when I first went around a year ago as well as the portion size has gone down. Noodle soup has a fishy taste. Overall good food and good price."}
{"text":"Found a fly in my congee! I am a regular at Congee Queen at the Markham location, and always thought their food tasted good. Really disappointing for this location."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. The congee is the best. I also like the chicken fried rice and the rice noodles /w sautay beef. The restrooms are nice,and the staff are friendly. Overal, the experience was nice."}
{"text":"Congee Quenn has become one of my fav spot for Chinese food. The service here is fast, efficient and the services are friendly. Price range for their food is reasonable, for $10.95 you can get a huge noodle or rice dish which is totally worth. At this location they offer a special lunch menu between 1-5pm (I believe) and whatever main dish you order from this menu, you receive a free drink. You have choices like (red bean freeze, lemon tea hot/cold  and HK style milk tea hot/cold). Congee Queen is definitely worth a try if your in the area."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is a little like comfort food.  Among my group of friends, when we can not decide what to eat the one thing everybody can agree on is Congee Queen.  They have a good blend of Asian food and the service is quick.  Very much recommended and the congee definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"Congee was just fine nothing special. We order the lobster which was not spicy at all and very oily. The roasted duck would be our favorite for the day. Overall is just ok. Customer service is not very good."}
{"text":"I have been to congee queen quite a few times, and this was the worst experience ever.   Sat down at approximately 5 pm and it was not busy at all. The server took 10 minutes to acknowledge us and didn't ask for our drinks. We gave her our order and requested 4 waters. Originally we ordered 7 items but only received 5. After eating almost all of our food, we mentioned to the server we did not get the other two items (also requested that it would be cancelled because we were done our meal) and she told us that if it was cooked we had to pay for it still..... Giving food 1 hour apart just doesn't make sense   Also at this time we still didn't have our waters, we asked 3 different servers for waters. It was just a terrible experience... Along with the fact that the servers would take our plates with food on it still..."}
{"text":"Service and food was shit. Waitress didn't even ask if we wanted to start with a drink, which is standard. I ordered a mango slush when we ordered our meal and I waited so long because all the servers didn't even care to come by us. So when i finally saw one i waved him down and he told me that there's no order of the drink.  So I ordered it again and again it took soo long for it to come. I ordered noodles and it was so blend. Service was slow, careless and inconsiderate. Never going there again. BTW this was around 3 30 pm. It wasn't even busy..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years with the family and it's always been good HK Cantonese food with very reasonable prices.  It's a bit out of the way for a downtowner like me but it's not as far as the other good places to eat in Richmond Hill or Markham :)  I have a good friend as well as an aunt who both live around the corner from this location and they love this place.  I'm not sure whether the Congee Queen chain is related or opened by a former chef of Congee Wong (which was around first) but they're both great restaurants chains as I've been to several and the quality is consistent.  Obviously great congee (esp. the large size seafood one) and noodles.  The service is fast (once you get seated) and you don't have one server as you just flag one down.  The dishes come fast because they have a simple menu that looks more complex than meets the eye.  The dishes are really standard vegetable, rice, noodles, and congee with a different spin so avoid ordering two similar dishes or you may find them tasting similar.  BBQ and roast meats are excellent.  Portions are large and not greasy like some places.  Very busy place during peak hours so come early (especially if you have a group of 6-10 since there are only a few large tables).  They do take out too."}
{"text":"Food is a little bit pricey , but it is always busy so they are doing something right. Mango pudding and milk pudding are amazing and have me coming back every time. They also have the best spicy paste ever."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant randomly and it was fantastic. Very busy, can understand why. Huge selection of excellent food. We ordered what could have fed 8 people and there was two of us. Pricing was very reasonable too.   Their pork and duck was phenominal. We will be returning again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. My go to spot for Chinese food. The rosted pork and BBQ duck are my favorite."}
{"text":"Never had such a giant bowl of seafood congee before (the house super bowl). It was huge and DELICIOUS! We also had a plate of pad thai that was less than remarkable (but still decent). The service was alright. The food arrived quickly which was nice."}
{"text":"I am giving a five star because good and plenty amount of food, and fairly good service. Typical Cantonese food.  It is a place I can go and have supper when I do not feel like cooking. It is way better than other congee restaurants."}
{"text":"Service was fast and for a Chinese restaurant, polite enough. Lol. Food was good though, except I've had better lobster in cheaper places. The mango shrimp and chicken was definitely a plus. And the Cantonese chow mein was crispy as it should be. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Best Congee Restaurant!! I love their Salmon Fried Rice!! Good quality food with fast service! The only place i eat congee, other restaurants just can't compare."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Food is decent but not the greatest. Good for the price, typical chinese food."}
{"text":"Place is rammed and it's 5:30! Have been to 3 other Congee Queen's around Scarborough and Markham and have had great meals. Likewise here! Worth the wait. Good sized servings, great taste, fast service, and noisy ambience! Item K11b is great. Try it! Come early darlin's!"}
{"text":"Great food but every time we encounter some health related issue.  Today we discovered hair in the food and the waiter were not helpful at all"}
{"text":"Food: is good, amazing for the price you're paying  Service: servers are not all about small talk - they are fast and always in a rush - which is fair, it is a busy restaurant. They are not rude but just busy running around attending to the other tables!  Ambience: not a place you want to sit and dine for ages. Food comes out fast and it's somewhere to go for a quick bite to eat.  Overall: Cheap and cheerful place. Good food and fast service."}
{"text":"Service is okay, gets busy here sometimes, especially on weekends. Would not recommend for mediocre food at best."}
{"text":"Tasty pumpkin congee! Upscale interior, average service, good hours."}
{"text":"Delicious food all fresh! Try the BBQ honey pork BBQ pork fried rice  roasted whole chicken Pan fried vermicelli  Vegetable spring rolls Sirloin  Fried squid  soup  Everything is really good. Service is definitely on demand but worth the wait. Ladies bathroom needs some attention."}
{"text":"We come here at least 1x/month for family celebrations/birthdays.  I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars based on the following criteria:  taste, affordability and quantity   The food always comes out fast, hot (not like at Spring Rolls!!) and fresh.  Yes, the customer service could be better at times as you do have to often flag down the waiters during the rush meal hours.  However, I have never had any rude service here and we've been coming here for the last 4 years! Now that I live in the West end, we still make the trip here.  If you're new to Chinese traditional restaurants, don't forget to ask for a number so that they can seat you at the table when one becomes available.  My favorite dishes: House Pad Thai (it's not dry) Stir fried Sea bass with King mushroom Seafood with bean curd soup Seafood Congee-Superbowl Stir Fry Chicken with mixed vegetable (ask for chicken breast. There's a $2 extra cost, but it's worth it. Otherwise, the default is chicken thigh)"}
{"text":"Great Chinese food place. we ordered the chicken and corn soup, BBQ duck, fried turnip cakes. All are very fresh and very tasty. Very busy place but fast service. One of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Not impressed with lack of customer service. I waited for 30 mins to get served and had to flag down a waiter! They messed up my drink order. Food was bland but the portions were huge. Also had to flag someone down to pay my bill, maybe they assumed I could not pay for my meal..lol anyhow would not recommend"}
{"text":"The decor was pretty nice.  Place was huge and lots of tables, no need to worry about waiting in line for a table.   Food was served very fast, prices were reasonable and proportions were very generous.   This is by far the best Congee Queen location.    Will I come back... yes!  This location is very clean and comfortable.  The servers were pretty nice as well."}
{"text":"amazing food. seafood congee crave acomplished. new locaton. center point. enplug is awsome"}
{"text":"Love congee queen! The plates are big and the cost is so affordable. The restaurant is nicely renovated and seating there is comfortable. They also have afternoon tea! Same portions and same price as menu I believe but with a free drink! Don't order their bubble tea though.. it wasn't that great! Try cold lemon tea or red bean drink."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and will definitely come here in the future. This place is my default restaurant for a number of things. Food is always good and I've never had a bad experience here.  Some of my regular dishes (everything is to be shared): Seafood Super Bowl Congee - filled with salmon, crab meat, squid, scallop, shrimp and a white fish (not sure which exact fish).  Shredded Pork & preserved egg congee - okay, this might not be for everyone since the black preserved egg may be an acquired taste for some.  Cantonese Chow Mein - love the crispiness of the mein. I only wish they have more veggies on this dish.  Fried Chili Turnip Patties  - great app. It's not hot at all so if you're looking for a lot of spice there's chili oil on the table or you can just ask for hot sauce.  Spice and Pepper Salt Squid - the name doesn't do this justice. Fried squid with bits of hot peppers and regular peppers. It's delicious.  Pan Fried Three Kinds of Stuffed - I got this with a friend for kicks because this is probably the most descriptive name ever. . What's this \"three kinds of stuffed\"? It's basically tofu, peppers and eggplant stuffed with fish paste with a black bean sauce. Pretty delicious. I don't get this often but it is pretty good.  Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll - another great app, the dough fritters are freshly fried wrapped in the rice noodle. Sauces on the side for dipping.   Everything is reasonably priced too as many of the dishes are under $10.  Cheap and delicious. Just how I like it."}
{"text":"We ordered a their house super bowl congee, cantonese chow mein, general tao chicken, veggie fried rice, beef in black bean sauce, and salt and pepper squid. The squid was okay. Everything else was quite good. My husband raved about the black bean sauce beef, and I really liked the chow mein and general tao. We were a group of 5 and we ate til we were stuffed, and had leftovers to take home. Price is reasonable. Just to note though, maybe because the location is new, the restaurant was packed and there was like a ~20min wait time for a Friday lunch. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I come here quite often. One of my go to restaurants for congee or when I want to eat an inexpensive early dinner. They have specials that come with any free drink during the weekdays if you arrive before 5pm. Service really depends on the time. I would say most of the time service was great. They get really busy after 6/7pm so obviously there will be more waiting. But even during busy hours you will get your food quite fast."}
{"text":"Very disappointed about the mix wild rice congee.  It is pretty a regular white congee with few wild rice.  It seems Centre point location does better job.  The oyster tuff with much room is so so."}
{"text":"The food is definitely AMAZING!!! The only thing is service is....well...slightly better than other Chinese restaurants. If you're the type of person who wants service, this isn't the best place. But if you're looking for really great chinese food with huge portions, this is definitely the spot!"}
{"text":"This is a Chinese version of a Denny's.  Fast, Filling, Family Style, and Friendly on the wallet.  Honestly, this is my family's go to place when we are too lazy to cook.    Beware that the line can be out the door on weekend nights from 6:30-8 PM, with a wait that can be  up to half an hour.  Call ahead for takeout.  Recommendations: Salt + Pepper Fish- their salt and pepper seasoning is like crack, it's so good Congee (that's a given, it's named Congee Queen) Any of their bbq meats are good (ex: Roasted pork) Wonton Noodles in Soup Hot Pot Rice (takes a while to come out though, about 20 min after the order) Crispy Catonese Chow Mein Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll"}
{"text":"It's most important for me is that they have Hongkong milk tea and the tofu and duck here are also tasteful"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night and thought it will be a long wait time. It only took 15mins for a table of two. We ordered the shredded pork and gold preserved egg congee, fried rice noodle with XO sauce, sweet and sour pork, and the crispy chicken with secret sauce. The congee was really delicious, probably one of the best I've ever had. The food came out quickly, within 10 minutes of ordering.   They gave us 10% off our bill for the grand opening, not too sure how long this discount will be applied for. Overall a good experience and will definitely come back"}
{"text":"we went to Congee Queen in Christmas Eve. It is not our first choice. We went to Mr Congee but we couldn't find a parking spot there so we decided to give this congee restaurant a try.  Since it was christmas eve and there were a lot of people waiting there. We waited half an hour before getting seated. The restaurant is very noisy as any other busy Chinese restaurant so we wouldn't expect any difference. However, the food is very disappointing.  we ordered a congee with seafood and minced winter melon. The seafood was not very fresh, so the entire congee had unpleasant smell. There were a lot of ginger slices inside the congee, which was very annoying since I don't eat ginger so I had to take them one by one. As for the winter melon part, it was so undercooked that it was very crunchy. I have had seafood and winter melon congee in other restaurants and this is the first time I had raw winter melon in it.  We also ordered Fried Eggplant with minced pork and spicy sauce. The sauce was nothing but salty, and there was a lot of starch in the sauce, making it very unpleasant in texture.  Another dish we ordered was fried handmade udon with beef and soy sauce. This is usually a signature dish in any cantonese style Chinese restaurant, and every good chef should be able to serve a good one. However, what's on our table was very bad. The noodle was broken badly while some of the noodle sticked together and undercooked. The soy sauce seemed to be burnt and tasted bitter.  The only decent dish that night was the stewed beef tendon.   I don't know whether the food was always that bad in Congee Queen, or it was because of the Christmas eve and the main chef was taking a break. The dining experience was so terrible that we wouldn't give it another try."}
{"text":"Quite a big selection on their menu. Love their congee. Food is rather oily and definitely MSG-y. Service is quick. Price is a little higher compared to Markham/Richmond Hill, but still pretty good value. Dishes are hit and miss. The duck and preserved vegetable fried noodle was a big disappointment though. So was their cruller (\"chinese donut\")- it was soggy soft and oily, not fresh or crispy at all. The Queen special soup noodle broth was really good, although it had offal in it which I am not a fan of. Overall it is a good option for Chinese food in the area."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing. I'd come here every weekend when possible.  However, I've found that the quality of food has gone down over this past year.  This is why this place gets a 1 star.    I had the snow shoot vegetables...usually when you order this dish - they fry it in oil and garlic.  The dish came out in a white milky translucent broth. I've never seen this dish turn out like this before (even at this establishment).  The vegetables were old and hard to chew.  Next was the fried turnip cubes (usually a favorite of mine at this place)....the dish was very substandard compared to what it used to be in the past. The turnips were soggy...the red sauce not evenly coated on each cube.    After this was the char-siu rice noodle rolls.  I don't know what was wrong with the char-siu, but it tasted rubbery. The noodle was cooked fine (tender, but not soggy).  I was just so bewildered by the meat...I've never had char-siu that tasted like that.  Ordered the chicken pot rice with preserved meat.  The waiter advised that it would take 20 mins for it to come out, which was fine by me.  45 mins into the meal, I still hadn't received this dish. When I asked the waiter to look into the status...they came back with a \"this dish normally takes 30 mins so it should be done now.\"   Either way when the chicken rice came out, I wasn't too happy with the quality either. The vegetables on top were too tough to eat ( clearly very old).  when I bit into the chicken, the meat was still pink inside.   I liked the rice, but really...that isn't so hard to mess up.  I used to love this place, but sadly, I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"We ate here a few times until the location at Agincourt opened up (the Agincourt one is closer to our house than this location). The food is not expensive but not cheap. It is a bit upscale in terms of setting. They gladly accommodated a party of around 50 people when we booked with them and provided us with plates and forks for the cake we brought in. All-in all we were happy with their service. Because it is within a mall lot, parking wasn't a problem. And who does not like good Chinese food? My personal favorite is the calamari and spicy fried fish."}
{"text":"This place is slightly upscale than other Chinese restaurants. However, we don't come here on a date, we come here for some serious eating. We have met friends here for lunch and dinner. The place is always packed so expect real serious noise (one reason why you shouldn't bring a date for a romantic night out). Like the menu, especially the deep fried spicy calamari and deep fried spicy fish. These are my faves. This is located at Agincourt mall, so parking shouldn't be an issue."}
{"text":"I've been trying to write a review from my iPad without success, now typing on main PC, and just signed up on Yelp.  I really like this restaurant!  Been coming quite often after discovery a few months ago.  - fast friendly staff - food is fresh and tasty - service is quick - portions are large - prices are extremely reasonable  I guess the only possible negative (which is a positive for me) is the staff move pretty quick.  They are friendly IMO but don't stand and smile and chat.  This is a good thing for us as sitting down for a good hot and relatively fast meal is the reason my wife and I go to restaurants.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"3.5, on a good day.   My parents really enjoy eating at Congee Queen, and as a result, we dine here fairly often.   I don't recall having had a bad meal at Congee Queen, in terms of both service and the food itself, so I feel slightly guilty rounding down. However, I have never really been wowed by any dishes here. The food is consistently solid, but not outstanding.   That being said, I particularly enjoy the Fried Chili Turnip Patties, BBQ meats and fried rice.   The ambiance at this location is nice. It is always busy, but the dining experience doesn't feel too rushed and the service is polite. The decor is also sleek and fairly fancy for a Chinese restaurant in Markham."}
{"text":"The fried rice was plain, dry and didn't have much favors. I expect better congee but it was tasteless. Decoration was modern but do not expect too much from food quality."}
{"text":"The food here is in really big quantities, they are a good deal.  Sometimes the food is too bland for me but I guess it's good because they are not making everything salty and keeping the food healthy!  I used to have a crave for their milk pudding, it's extremely delicious!   I like the fungus congee very healthy option and tasty.  My family really likes this restaurant even though they could improve their flavors."}
{"text":"The food was fairly decent, but I had the worst dining experience with waitress that was assigned to our table. I don't expect five-star service when I'm dining in Chinese restaurants (I am Chinese myself), but this was beyond appalling. We had a misunderstanding in one of the items we ordered and thought that she might have brought us another table's congee. She somehow managed to turn it on us and blame us for the mistake. She scolded us, saying that she even repeated the order to us and that we were looking for trouble. We don't dispute that it was our mistake, we would have gladly eaten it. That entire experience just took our appetite away.   We spoke to some family members later, and my aunt had a similar experience with the very same waitress. She had found a millipede in her veggie stir-fry and had notified the waitress. She scolded her as well and accused her of looking for a discount. The waitress' name is Lily. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'll second the first reviewer, except for the 'not too far from downtown' bit. I have to commute out there everyday, and it doesn't feel close! But if you're already out there, stop in for lunch or dinner. Fantastic. I'm a fan of the baby bok choi with garlic, the crispy pork, and the lemon chicken. (Now I'm hungry...)"}
{"text":"Lots of variety, always get lobster and chicken and duck congee which are both delicious."}
{"text":"I usually order a pot of seafood congee and it's big enough for two people. The appetizers are also good. My friend and I usually spend less than $20 for dinner over there."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!  We ordered take out for New Years Eve at 4:30pm.  I specified that we will PICK UP at 6pm.  We went to pick up and they said there was no order under our phone number or name.  Kept asking and asking for them to check. After being yelled at \"What are you doing here?\" 5 times... They finally realized it was under the DELIVERY system not the PICK UP system. They said it was being delivered.  So we went home and waited. Kept calling every half hour- we got hung up on many times... They kept telling us it was being delivered and will be there in 20 minutes.  At 8:30pm after 4 hours being ordered- we gave up.  Called them again to complain and we told them we'll cancel the order.  Hardly any apologies or regrets...  Granted it was NEW YEARS EVE, I understand things can get crazy... but you figure it's Congee Queen and they have experience with this. STILL- NO EXCUSES!   We ordered from KEUNGs and the food was ready for pick up in 30 minutes.  No trouble, no mess up. Easy.  Our poor kids were hungry and we finally ate at 9:30pm.   I've banned CONGEE QUEEN from my list of GO TO restaurants in Markham. I used to come here all the time... NEVER AGAIN. Goodbye Queen of CRAPPY service."}
{"text":"We ordered seafood congee, roast pork & crispy pig combo, fried rice, stir fried turnip cake Malay style, beef rice noodle roll & one other dish. Service was quick & the food was absolutely delicious! The decor is contemporary & there is a live fish tank in the restaurant. Throughout our entire time there, the waiters & waitresses were hustling around serving everyone in a quick manner. Also there is an area in the back where you can order duck & barbecue pork to go. We will definitely return again the next time we visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"The name may be congee but congee queen gives you a large variety of food choices  They have great BBQ meats, seafood fishes and even congee.. I highly recommend them because they have good food, great service and yes, amazing prices  But it is not your average date place. It is a place for family gathering, foodie gathering"}
{"text":"This is my 50th times visiting this particular Congee Queen, since they opened...  Why the ONE star rating?  That is because my dining experience yesterday (November 7, 2015) with my family was destroyed... My confidence is their ability to be customer focused is down to ZERO!  I am a regular customer to this Congee Queen since they opened. I used to visit their Don Mills and Steeles location as I also knew their manager Lara from her management debut 15 years ago at the first Congee Wong location at Kennedy and Highway 7.   As the Commerce Valley location is closer to my hood, I visited this one quite often. It became my regular joint after each vacation and every time I considered a quick meal with good food and value. I went there so often that I knew their regular servers: Tina, Alice, Stephanie, and even their manager Candy whom Lara introduced me when I bumped into her once.  My favourite dishes were their fresh fish selection and BBQ meats.   We decided to host a family dinner for our out of town guest versus the banquet style. restaurant. I booked Congee Queen on Friday November 7, 2015 for 10 people. When I got there at 5:40 p.m. (just to be sure that I could make sure, that I could get some fresh fish, because in my last visit a month ago, they told me that they gave away the fish that I ordered through Stephanie...). I wanted to make sure that the fish entrée was available for my family as most people enjoyed a scrumptious steamed Green bass.   I was very happy when I was greeted Tina, my regular server who is excellent. She showed us a table, which was quite close to the front door and had no room for my Mom's walker. After talking to her, she provided us an alternate table close to the BBQ counter, the kitchen and the washroom (for a very senior person like my Mom, this is important).    To ensure that the last 'missing' fish incident did not happen, I spoke to Tina right away and she confirmed that they have green bass available. After I sat down, I talked to Stephanie and asked her about the size of the fish as we had a family of 10. She was very prompt and came back, and informed me that the largest fish weighted about 1.75 pound. Therefore, I asked her to reserve two Green bass fish just to be sure.   Stephanie was quite efficient, went to the kitchen, and told them to reserve two fish for us.  Therefore, I was so happy that we secured the Fish entree... (And so I thought :(    )  Everyone arrived promptly at 6 p.m., which was a bonus... as we were all excited to try Congee Queen for our first family 'banquet' of sorts....   As the regular servers were not around (Stephanie, Tina, Alice, Candy etc.), we got ourselves another server but figured that we could work with her as she wrote everything down and repeated to us:  We ordered the following and she was writing down our selection in the following order:  1. One whole BBQ duck 2. BBQ combination with BBQ pork (crispy skin) and BBQ pork (sliced) 3. Pea shoots with Kings Mushroom 4. Hot pot with assorted mushroom and Gluten vegetarian dish 5. 2 Green Bass (steamed) and she confirmed that we wanted plain steam with onion and ginger. 6. One lobster (regular size) with spicy sauce - the server confirmed that it was a regular size and not the 3-pound variety.  7. Chinese broccoli and beef fried noodles 8. Fish Maw soup with egg drop (large pot) 9. Jelly fish dish on its own (she confirmed that we could not put it together with our BBQ meats and we said okay because it is a tradition to have jellyfish with the BBQ pork)  The server repeated the above and went to put our order in. Well, the BBQ duck, BBQ combination, jelly fish came out first. Then the soup, hot pot, pea shoots came with the noodles etc.  But we figured that the fish might take a while... Also, we ordered a Yang-Chow Fried Rice because we wanted to have it with the fish...  I needed to explain something - My mom is a very old senior with dentures so the fish entree was the only dish that she could enjoy and chew...   *****Guess what! The Fish never arrived! *******   I figured that because the restaurant was getting busy and it might be delayed... NO!  It NEVER came. We asked one of the servers to check it and she said `sorry it is no longer available`. I almost fell off my chair.   So I thought like a good client, I approached the manager looking person (he is the person who does not have to wear a uniform or apron).  He said ``No, it is not on your order`` and left.  NO APOLOGY! NO follow up.   As we sat closed enough to the kitchen, we saw the other tables with our fish.   I had enough of it and went to talk to Alice, the assistant` lead server. She listened to me and quickly told me \"sorry, but we could give you free dessert\" and ran off.   Really? Free dessert?  I always get free dessert when I visited all the previous times.  By this time, I had enough of their arrogance, lack of customer service and simply disappointed at knowing that I will never go back there again."}
{"text":"They accomplished something nearly impossible:  made me not enjoy a Chinese meal.  The waits are typically stupid.  When you finally have a seat, service SUCKS.  We even went when the joint was half empty and it was impossible to get any attention to order and to get the check as servers were too busy chatting.  Worse yet, the food isn't even that great.  The turnip cakes were really good.  Everything else is greasy, heavy and bland (albeit far too salty).  Everything is fried which gets tiring.  Some fried chicken dish had thighs that resembled jerky.  Garoupa was rife with bones.  So: - It's Chinese food.   - It's not particularly good Chinese food. - You'll be treated like crap. - Your stomach will feel like crap."}
{"text":"Probably the nicest looking Congee Queen to-date.    We were extremely impressed with the decor upon walking-in.  The menu is the same as the other Congee Queen locations, so the food is consistent and good.  The wait staff seem nice and friendly.     Will probably go back, maybe with a smaller group, and request to sit away from the kitchen.  I would've given this 4 stars, but have to settle with 3 stars due to hiccups at the grand-opening week.  There are a few things I couldn't overlook, perhaps they will get it right later.  1) no lazy Susan's on big round dining tables.  We were a group of 8 sitting at a large round table, and it was inconvenient to eat family style without lazy Susans to spin the food around.  2) we specifically said to waiter, \" no onions/green onions\", to which he repeated the order, and the kitchen still served all dishes with it.    3) after dinner, our clothes smelled like stir fried, ...our table was closer to the kitchen entrance, so had absorbed the aromas.  Not to my liking."}
{"text":"The food is ok for what you pay but I'm not sure why my drink was not filled to the top as if someone had a sip. Also, every time the waiters deliver the dishes, they chose to deliver over my infant's seat above his head while there are so many other spots to drop off the plates."}
{"text":"Went for afternoon tea and got lai wan style congee w/ lemon tea and a rice noodle with beef and vegetables w/ red bean slush and ice cream. Congee was soo good with squid, peanuts, bbq duck, pig skin, and shrimp! The rice noodle had lots of beef and fried really well. Love that their dishes are still regular size and not \"lunch portions\""}
{"text":"Food is always very good Friendly wait staff is important to me and this place is seriously lacking that."}
{"text":"Food - Flavourful with nice portions  Our table of 8 all ordered different things and shared them amongst each other, but I have to say that the fried rice noodle with beef in black bean sauce was very good compared to the other noodle dishes. The Cantonese chow mein was okay, but I've had better elsewhere. The congee was good, as expected from a place basing their name off of it. We got the house seafood super bowl congee, but I had to add soy sauce as it was not very salty, but after adding the soy sauce, it was very good. General Tao chicken was okay, but a little hard and dry; at least the piece I tried was.  Service - Average  It was extremely busy when we came on a Saturday night so I didn't expect much from the service. All the workers looked extremely busy, but despite the hustle and bustle, we had fairly decent service. It just required flagging down anyone who passed by our table, not necessarily our own server (I'm not even sure if we had just one server. It seemed like we has quite a few different ones). Food came very quickly, but sometimes plopped down on our table very forcefully due to the rush in the restaurant - nothing new in an Asian restaurant, haha.  Atmosphere - Loud, but not disruptive  Of course it would be loud, what with the huge amount of seating in the restaurant and the number of guests, but it didn't bother me or my experience.   The food was good, the service was decent, and we didn't have to wait exceptionally long for a seat (only about 15 minutes), so I have nothing to complain about. The prices are also acceptable, so I will be coming here again if I ever find myself in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, despite it being really busy, they have superb service here.  We got our food very shortly after ordering and all the staff are very polite and helpful. I know how hard it is to work in a restaurant and the fact that the staff here are all very nice and polite really made the experience that much more enjoyable.   The prices here are great. If it doesn't take much to fill you, like me, you can leave with a full stomach for a little more than $5! Though, whenever I come here, I always end up ordering more than I can eat because there is so much good food to choose from.  Their congee is great. I always get it when I come to one of the chains. Nothing like a hot, thick bowl of Cantonese congee with preserved eggs! I went to another Congee Queen and their congee had hardly any flavour or salt, but here, it wasn't too salty and was quite tasty. I really enjoyed it.  Our server cleared our table very impressively, carrying all the dishes at once, but I was still finishing off my crab claw. I think he noticed this, because when he came back to collect the bill, he brought a couple napkins for me to wipe my hands on after. I thought that was a very thoughtful and nice gesture on his part, and I'm surprised he even noticed!  I would definitely come here again because their service is wonderful, even for such a busy place. That's why they're so busy all the time!  Would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I was here for the first time on a Friday night. There was a constant wait for seats. I must say, they did a very good job of turning tables, as different sizes of groups never had to wait more than 10 minutes.  Food tastes great, they do not skim on the ingredients, portion is generous, and prices are low. Service is average popular Chinese restaurant service. It is clean and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Their roasted pork totally hit the spot. The super bowl house special congee was HUGE! enough to feed 10 people."}
{"text":"The food was tasty, it also came pretty quick. However, the service need a lot of improvements.  We went on a week night, as a group of 6, and the restaurant was not too busy. There were a lot of staff working that night but they were all busy running around and seemed to be ignoring our table most of the night.  After we had ordered our food, one of the waiters came around...brought us all dinner plates and then proceeded to bring out forks for the 2 of us (the europeans) while giving the other 4 (the asians) each a pair of chopsticks... Is it just me or is that pretty racist?!  Not only that, as we were finishing up our food I notice that there was water dripping on me. I immediately looked up and realized that the vent that was above me was dripping water onto me."}
{"text":"I'm not from any of the Asian countries, so I found the whole experience rather novel and fun. Here are some notes for those who are not familiar with the experience.  The most important thing to know is that unlike in a typical Western restaurant, you order the dishes that will be shared between all the people at your table. Don't worry, you get your own plate, spoon and chopsticks, or if you prefer, fork. So if you are ordering roast duck over rice, you get a largish plate that the patrons at your table all share in.  The place is quite busy, so I found everyone chowing our chow mein rather quickly. Other interesting thing is that between three people we payed around $40 for 4 dishes. This compares favorably to a restaurant I was at recently where I plopped down $80 for two.You may want to bring cash so it's easier to split the bill if you want to. I can also say that I enjoyed this meal much more than the one I had at the Italian restaurant. Overall, 4 stars. I wish the place was a little bit bigger with more open space and not as loud. Recommended."}
{"text":"I have gone to two Congee Queens so far. This one and the one near it, on Lawrence.  I want to give both 5 stars...Very low price for huge servings and fresh ingredients. They do not skimp on the ingredients either. Most importantly, they have mastered the art of making everything taste good, at least to an average Canadian.  Because this location opened up around August, the decor here is even better. They have some fancy looking lighting and decorated ceilings.  If you like Congee Queen, I would say this location lives up to the expectation."}
{"text":"We've been here many times for both lunch and dinner.  The food is either under seasoned or just right.  Hit or miss.  However, this will be the very last time we ever step foot in their Markham or other locations ever again.  We went there for dinner tonight and ordered our usual fair... deep fried salted squid, deep fried spicy pork chops, homestyle rice noodles, beef & egg fried rice and stir fried Chinese greens.  Although the food was seasoned well, the squid were soggy, the pork chops were oily and the fried Chinese greens (dow-mew?...not sure how to write that) was mushy tasting which was a huge turn off considering they charged $15.99 plate!  As we were unable to eat everything, we asked for plastic take out containers.  They wanted to charged us $1. for each container!!!  They said we could have the styrofoam ones for free but because I wanted the plastic containers (which are reusable and not throw away like the other ones) they wanted $1. each.  I spoke to the manager and she was a real ditz.  She offered to put our food in a takeout box.     Even knowing we are regulars, this is how they treated us.  I am so disgusted with this restaurant.  I will never, ever go there again.  They do not give a rat's ass for their loyal customers.    In the end, the waitress brought over the plastic containers to us and said she would charge us $1. for each one.  She picked up the folder with our receipt & cash inside and assured us she was going to charge us.  I said, that's fine.  I'll just take it out of the tip.  To which she just stood there and said, no, this is a separate charge and walked back to the cashier to proceed with the bill for the containers.  Lol.  We just left at that point.  So, good riddance, Congee Queen.  You've lost our business.  So much competition in Markham.  You're just a needle in a haystack.    Besides, they're just a spin off (copy-cat) of Congee Wong anyway.  I would much rather go there from now."}
{"text":"Solid, fast chinese food.  While congee is a specialty, they offer a pretty wide range of food from noodles, some dim sum, and a variety of noodle dishes. +ives: price, quality, speed -ives: can be crowded, washrooms"}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant that me and my parents can agree on going to every time.   We've been going to this chain when only the only location was at Lawrence. Since then, they've expanded to locations across Markham, Richmond Hill and Scarborough.  Though there are many locations, The one at Agincourt Mall has always been the most consistent with their food quality - this one was opened by someone who used to work at the Don Mills and then the McCowan/Highway 7 location. The owner is very involved and is always around.   The service is very good and your order comes out very fast. The staff are very good and thorough - they ensure to read back your order back to you before they input it into the system. This location does get very busy on the weekend but I've never had to wait more than 7 minutes to be seated.  There really isn't anything on the menu I wouldn't recommend if you're in the mood for asian cuisine- there is something for everyone from thai to viet to canton staples. I will say, the chinese BBQ meats are very good as well as the turnip cake - these are staples every time we go and the consistency in quality on these items really sets it apart from other locations.  If you order any of the rice or noodle dishes, be ready to be eating for a day or five - the portions are lit.   Take out is very fast too - they let you use your own tupperware or give you reusable containers - I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes for an order.   See you soon Congee Queen!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food but some of the staff are extremely rude.   Our waitress took our order but didn't send it to the kitchen. When we asked her about it, she just said \"oh I guess I forgot to send it\" and walked away. We had to get another employee to redo our order, and finally got our food almost an hour after we arrived."}
{"text":"A typical Cantonese restaurant like a few others in the area.  I had their beef noodles today which I would not order again.  The beef is impossible to chew and swallow. MSG and salt makes the food tasteful but be careful if you are allergic to the chemical."}
{"text":"Went to Congee Queen in Markham with friend for lunch today.  As usual, it was a very busy day over there crowded with people on the weekends. However, we were so lucky today that we were seated for 2 ppl immediately when we arrived there around 12:15pm. We ordered one of our favorite dishes -Crab meat with fish maw thick soup $8.95, Boiled pork liver & kidney with ginger & green onion $7.25 and Beef tendon/beef brisket noodle in soup $5.95. They all came out so delicious and flavorful that we couldn't stop eating... Really like to come here over and over again when I feel like to have something simple not complicated but still really yummy...."}
{"text":"This is always our late dinner choice,food quality is steady,clean and light favour chinese food,the congee,noodle soup,rice roll are good and cheap,BBQ are also good choice,but I find the pan fry dish are not so good and also a bit pricey"}
{"text":"Service is fast, the interior is very modern, food portions are large, prices are reasonable and the store is consistent with the rest of the franchise. It's no wonder why this place is packed a lot of the time during dinner hours!"}
{"text":"I like the restaurant itself because it's very clean and modern but I ate there a few times and have gotten grimy looking glass and crappy service....The price is great and the food is usually good! I had a waitress get my order wrong and when I told her that she got the order wrong she started to yell and make very rude hand gestures...It was really weird! BTW she looks older than the rest of the staff, wears glasses,rude,yells when she is speaking to you and usually ties her hair in a ponytail. She was the worst waitress I've experience in a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Parking is difficult here, lots of scary signs about getting towed if u not eating at right restaurant.  Menu seems similar to congee Wong, but upscale.  Large menu with great hk food, I'll go back."}
{"text":"Dishes r delicious and porridge is really yummy! If u want some light Chinese cuisine it's also a nice place to go."}
{"text":"Definitely would NOT recommend this place!   We went in for a late dinner so it was not busy at all.  The service was ridiculous bad.  As I was ordering, the waiter got impatient and handed me a piece of paper to write down my own order.  They are quick to walk away without letting us finish requesting what we need such as napkins and drink order.    The congee was okay but everything else was not good at all.  The food has no flavor.    Overall experience was bad bad bad!!!!!!!  I would give this place a negative star if there is an option for that but unfortunately there isn't.  =("}
{"text":"I love coming here for a quick, cheap, and filling dinner.  I also love that it's so loud and family-friendly, that I can bring my toddler too!  Only thing I wish is that they do delivery, but oh well. What I love to order: Fried chili turnip patties (seriously!  they were more addictive than McD's fries!) House seafood super bowl congee Hot & sour soup or Wonton soup Fried rice noodle with beef & XO sauce Spicy softshell crab fried rice Fried rice noodle with XO sauce  What was \"meh\" to me (but will still order at times): Baby bok choy with garlic sauce Spice & pepper salt squid (might need to try this again consider all the rave reviews for it) Cantonese chow mein (does the job, but it's not \"blow my mind\" good) Pan stuffed egg plant  Really what it comes down to is I keep returning for the congee and those turnip patties.  But it does get packed pretty quickly, so I usually do take out (but when you go to the restaurant, don't wait in the line out the door, and go to the cashier to pick up your order and pay!).  Oh yeah, the servings are HUGE, but the leftovers are great for lunch the next day!"}
{"text":"Spoke highly of this place in my previous review and continued to enjoy their food until my recent experience. Came here around 5:30ish on weekend to beat the dinner crowd which was a smart move. The place filled up by 6pm with crowds waiting outside. We had to wait for couple friends to arrive so was just sipping on tea. We asked the server to refill the tea and she took the pot but never came back with it, which is quite normal because it is a very busy place. We tried to flag other servers to get our pot back multiple times and didn't have much luck. Finally we stopped a server to get our pot of tea back. Minor incident, again happens in busy places.  We placed our order and food arrived quickly... well except for one which never showed up. Again, human error these kinds of things happen. So we asked a server to cancel it and we ordered something else instead. After a couple minutes of placing our additional order, we got our bill as another server thought we were all done. We told him that we are still waiting on food and he was apologetic about it. Within a couple minutes after another server comes and tries to clear the table and again we had to tell him that we are not done. The food arrived and we were still eating and chatting, another server comes and asks if we are all done. No we are not! Clearly there is still food on the table and I get that you want to serve more customers but it doesn't mean you try and get rid of your seated customers. At this point, our table was quite annoyed and after this disappointing experience we aren't planning to revisit this location in near future."}
{"text":"Had takeout from this Congee Queen the other day. We  were very impressed. Much better than the Laurance and  Steels locations. Will come back to this location  rather than the others ones"}
{"text":"I have been here with my girlfriend at least 4 times now.  We love the salted fish with chicken fried rice. We really like the stir fried lobster with ginger and green onion.   HOWEVER, this time we ordered the Stir fried lobster with ginger and green onion AND E-FU NOODLE (because it was an additional $3 for noodle vs no noodle), but we got only 2 tiny pieces of lobster meat, 1 lobster head, 1 lobster tail END, several pieces of claws , AND 4 PIECES of CRAB body attached to 3 limbs. What the heck??? Crab in my lobster order??? Before we ordered, we asked the waitress if the order of lobster with noodle would include a WHOLE lobster, and he answered \"YES.\" We were VERY DISAPPOINTED with this order. We came mainly for the lobster but got ripped off.   Now I feel the restaurant is very shady. How could I trust the restaurant if this happened--- replacing lobster meat with crab meat and claiming its lobster? I will not let myself to come back here again.   I HIGHLY recommend if you guys eat here to check what you order, especially the lobster orders."}
{"text":"Just picked up some lo mein and it is awful!  It smelled like paint solvent, not to mention how unappetizing it tasted.  It went straight to the garbage.  Never again."}
{"text":"Good place to go for family dinner or a quick eat. Serving was amazingly fast and the food was nice. Food quality quite surprising considering how many locations they are managing. Recommend."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall, we headed for lunch because I had a craving.  The place was not very busy when we arrived, we were seated right away.   We ordered fried chili turnip cubes, seafood congee with a deep fried donut, and a Cantonese chow mein. I could have ordered the entire menu.   The food came right away. Everything was delicious. The turnip cakes were like crack. You eat one but just can't stop. The congee was hot and well seasoned, the deep fried donut was fresh and crispy on the outside/chewy on the inside. The Cantonese chow mein was tasty with the right crispiness.   Service is good. Fast and efficient. No small talk. Water and tea refilled promptly. Typical Asian resto.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm hesitant to write this review because over the course of the months that I've been going, I've noticed longer and longer lines at the door. But all the servers are so nice that this place deserves it. Delicious food. Everything that I have eaten from this menu is great. And some dishes are more authentic than others, but it doesn't matter - authentic Chinese or Canadian Chinese, it's all delicious. I highly recommend the turnip cakes. That dish has never appealed to me before, but my sister forced me to order it and thank you that she did. Delicious morsels of fried and gooey turnips with pieces of shrimp and garlic. The hot and sour soup is both hot and sour - not something I can say for other bowls in the city. There are pieces of pickled vegetable that are an exciting bite when you get them. Judge me if you must, but their sweet and sour fried chicken is amazing. I doubt that you can find it on the streets of Beijing or a far off village, but delicious is delicious. The sauce is tangy, sweet and sour with pieces of pepper and pineapple.  This is a place that I will be coming back to a regular basis for years to come. And I'll be able to order a new dish every single time. The menu is interesting, diverse and never ending."}
{"text":"Quite bad! Perhaps their congee could be great?! Our mistake was dinner ordering dishes. Went because of all the good reviews. Service was fine, but food generally tasteless. The ???????? was fresh and good, but the ?? was fishy, not fresh. The ?????? had no ? nor ?? taste. The ????? was thick starchy. The ??? was not ??? as claimed. Meat was a little powdery, and tasted has been in fridge for a while. Would not recommend and would not go back again."}
{"text":"Expertly prepared Cantonese food, including congee, noodles of all sorts and Popular dishes including fried squids, bbq pork and duck. Busy at lunch and dinner time. Why not go for their \"afternoon tea\" (3-5pm weekdays) with a wide selection of regular dishes. It comes with a complementary drink. A glass of red bean with a scoop of ice cream is one of the selections.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Big portion but quality may vary. Staffs are nice. Must try Cantonese fried noodles and congee."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times since it's convenient and my family and friends enjoy it. The food is decent and there are some dishes that I enjoy. However, I am disgusted by the terrible service. The staff clearly don't care about their customers. They have ignored us several times, rushed us, and I've seen terrible treatment to other customers. I ate here for afternoon tea once and a waitress got into a heated argument with a customer. They were yelling and saying terrible things in mandarin. The waitress had to be brought into the back by other staff and she still continued to yell. I've had terrible experiences with their delivery service as well. They offer free delivery over $30. However, the delivery man complained about the lack of tip. He argued and refused to leave. He kept stating that he must pay for gas and that we were being selfish for not tipping him more. I was shocked by his behaviour. It is completely rude to blame a customer for not tipping enough. He argued with me for 5 minutes and was very persistent about needing more money from me. I felt that the tip was already generous considering I live very close to the restaurant. I couldn't even enjoy the rest of my day after having the delivery man blame me for 5 minutes. I was completely disgusted by his behaviour and I definitely will not be ordering delivery from this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid treatment! I have never been so mortified in my life at a restaurant! Took my mother out for a surprise dinner at her favourite place (+ the rest of the family). We had just finished a good meal, and we're talking after paying the bill. A waiter called \"Chinny\" appears out of nowhere and demands what we thought of the meal, and the service. We were quite taken aback at the forcefulness of his approach and said nothing, before he pulled out my bill and demanded to know why I had not tipped a larger amount. I clearly stated that I hadn't because I had no received any exemplary service by any server that night. Usually when we go there, the waiter is patient enough to at least say hello and tend to us with a bit more consideration. But we basically had the food thrown at us this time, and I certainly wasn't going to tip extra for crappy service. He demanded we reconsider and leave some tip.   I never been so embarrassed in my life at a restaurant. Tipping isn't a fixed requirement, it's something extra given to acknowledge great service from a waiter.  Completely ruined a family get together with his attitude and tip-heckling. I expected better of Congee Queen, but it's just like most average Chinese-establishments in terms of the customer service. Meh."}
{"text":"I don't go to Chinese restaurants for the customer service or ambiance. It doesn't bother me that Congee Queen does not excel at either of these.   The place is clean, service is quick, and the food is excellent. They turn the tables quickly enough that you don't have to wait very long even during peak hours. You can find cheaper alternatives in Scarborough or in Chinatown, but there is nothing cheaper in the immediate area that is comparable.   My favourite dishes: - fried chili turnip patties - spice & pepper salt squid - lemon chicken - shrimp and chicken fried rice in cream & tomato sauce - bbq pork - dough fritter"}
{"text":"hmm, i see a trend here. yet another \"chinese\" restaurant in my neighbourhood where we waited for ten-fifteen minutes with no server (and this time we were one of two whole tables in the place). and again, i walked out. i'd heard decent reviews from friends, never got a chance to see if the food was any good. smells great! poor/nonexistent service."}
{"text":"Standard chinese food restaurant with all the usual suspects on the menu. Cantonese food to be more precise. Quality is above average, portion sizes way above average. Extensive menu too. Overall worth a visit, especially if you are hungry. Open fairly late at night too, which is nice."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and ordered a bunch of dishes to share.   We got:  1) Seafood congee with fried cruller  2) Fried turnip patties  3) Singapore-style fried vermicelli  4) Weekly special of ordinary sizzling beef stir-fry   Everything was really great! Judging by the other reviews, the turnip patties are very much a must-order! They were so delicious - crunchy on the outside, flavoured so well, and smooth and soft on the inside. I'm dying to order them when I go back again!  The congee was also very good (of course) and the fried cruller was fresh. The vermicelli was better than your typical Chinese stir-fried noodles so I would definitely order it again as well."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food, everyone knows about this place because of its consistent and quality food. It's clean, and you're always served food in a relatively fast manner. Although, you might need to wait for a table during peak times because it seems like all of Markham is here. I've gone here multiple times with family, especially with my grandparents and it's definitely a favourite for eating out with the extended family. Nobody goes home disappointed after eating here, even the picky ones. Many of the \"traditional\" dishes or staples are done quite well, like the chow mein and fried rice. Don't expect to get a table without waiting at least 20 minutes first if you're going on a holiday, or on Mother/ Father's day, for example."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Twice in a row they forgot our orders. The restaurant is half full. After reminding 2 different servers, finally the food came out being cold as a rock. After we paid, they forgot to bring back our changes and it was not a small amount. This restaurant sucks."}
{"text":"the food went downhill and tasteless. the worst is the owner is not willing to turn down the air con after customers complaints! not sure what is the intention. It was a freezing experience and ruined the friday night dinner. Blacklisted!!!!"}
{"text":"Its a new location, so its fancy lookin' and spiffy. Its in the spot where Brix used to be. The rest however is the standard fair of what you would expect from a congee queen; big portions, quality food, reasonable prices, poor/slow/inattentive service.   Im giving it 4 stars only because i like the food."}
{"text":"Great food! These guys have a huge menu that will satisfy even the pickiest taste. The service is friendly and fast. Maybe it's not the best Chinese restaurant around, considering the price and quality you can't go wrong with CQ."}
{"text":"Always our \"Go To\" place for chinese food....the service is fast, the food is great, good customer service and its clean... Even though its always packed, you are always guaranteed seats!"}
{"text":"I've been to Congee Queen twice, both times were on weekends and they are SO busy. Service wasn't particularly attentive, but that was understandable given how many people were dining at the time (and how many were waiting). Their food is generally quite good. Their congee tastes great."}
{"text":"Very poor service and bad food too. All the waiters and waitresses were extremely rude and disrespectful. AVOID at all costs!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for tonight and found a piece of pork in the sweet and sour that appears a little under cooked (still very pink on the inside). Gross."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, clean, reliable authentic and consistent.  Lots of variety.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My family's go-to when we don't have food at home.  Food is always good and comes out fast. It gets really crowded and there can be a pretty long lineup during weekends.   Several things we usually got are the chicken and duck congee, turnip, the red/white fried rice, eel fried rice, and tiger shrimp."}
{"text":"Favourite: A11 Seafood & Chicken with Wintermelon Super Bowl Congee  High recommend:   E5 House Seafood & Mixed Vegetable Fried Taiwanese Vermicelli. Try it with their in-house made hot spice sauce that have on the table!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about a year now and out of the year, it totalled to 6 visits. I should have written a review when I was out with my family but after my last visit, I had to let some steam out.   My girlfriend and I including another friend dropped in about 2 hours before closing right after the gym. (We were definitely HANGRY) So I noticed that they finished with there late night dinner rush. We were shown to our seats and we've placed out order with the server who spoke english. As we waited (30 minutes in) I noticed that other tablets that came after us were being served including the table next to us that just sat down within 5 minutes of me noticing that we weren't being served.   We ended up eating 1 dish out of the 5 we've order and I've decided to check out since we only received 3 dishes out of the 5. So the other 2 got cold and I said \"fuck it\" we are leaving. At the cash out, this is where it got REALLY bad. The host/owner printed out our receipt and I noticed that there were only 3 dishes ordered and that was when I noticed how these sneaky servers are.   TIP: If you are planning on coming here, make sure they read back your order. ALSO if you notice that you didn't get your entire order at your table at a timely manner, DO NOT check with the server because chances are, they probably forgot to punch it in and they will not even tell you that. They will tell you that \"it's being made right now\" in order to cover up their fuck up.   If it's one thing I hate its a cover up of a mistake you've made. OWN UP TO IT.  So pretty much at the cash out, the server was debating why I didn't follow up with him and in my mind I was like \"uhhh, I know your dirty secret of how you cover things up so...\" pretty much it confirmed a lot of my experiences before at this location.   Cherry On Top - They expected us to pay the entire bill when we only ate 1 dish out of the 3 that was ordered. Management didn't bother to offer to comp our meal, or offered anything for our bad experience.  WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION"}
{"text":"Pretty packed place but all the waiters and hostess work at top speed, super efficient! The menu has a long list of choices from noodles to rice and of course congee. The congee here is more thick and like others have said, a bit more expensive than other places. The turnip patties were great and portion was huge!  3 stars because of cleanliness and the beef satay noodles were overly oily."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I've been to this location many times over the years, and have always had an enjoyable meal.  Not this time.  All of our favourite dishes have become mediocre (chili turnip, bbq pork).  We thought we'd try the chicken and chinese broccoli.  It was inedible.  When staff asked if we wanted to take it home as it was mainly untouched, we explained it was terrible.  No apologies, nothing.  It's sad, as we did enjoy coming here over the years.  Sad it's gone downhill so badly."}
{"text":"Today ordered satay beef rice, black bean with rice noodle, seafood with tofu soup, snow pea leaves with garlic and chile turnip patties for take out.  At 4:30pm tables are filled but still seating available. We came here mostly because I had to drop by maternity store and wanted to maximize our time in this area since its abit out if the way for us. Hence order Chinese from a place that we typically wouldn't go to (live in Etobicoke).  Congee Queen has never disappointed us in the past and I am happy to say it didn't disappoint this time either, even with take-out."}
{"text":"Don't get their takeout!! I come here on a somewhat regular basis and the food and service have always been pretty good. However, I got takeout for the first time last night and the portion size was practically halved but the price was the same. A plate of noodles can usually be shared between me and 1 person with leftovers, but in this case, it wasn't enough for us. This made the price feel way too expensive for what it was worth, but I know that it's usually worth it for dine in."}
{"text":"Cost: on the high side when compared to congee king Quality: average - 75% Decor: good - 80% a bit tight because they squeeze a lot of people in Staff: average service - 70% Value: good - 75%  Keeper? Yes but would rather go next door."}
{"text":"Standard Chinese food and quality. Can never go wrong here for something quick and easy. Easy Chinese fast food :-)"}
{"text":"I have been to all the Congee Queens in Toronto and the food is pretty much great at all of them. They seem to have the same standard that places them a bit above all other congee restaurants and I really enjoy eating here. Besides their congee, their BBQ section is amazing. I also recommend any of the noodle in soup and their salt and pepper squid (the toppings are what really do it!)   The problem with THIS location is that the service is GOD AWFUL. I have been to this location a total of 6 times and 4/6 times they forgot an order. One time it was so bad because we had to ask the waiter TWICE, he forgot both times so we walked out. When I went last night, we had to get for our bill from 3 different servers and still... none of them brought it.   If possible, I recommend going to their location at Don Mills and Steeles - it's definitely a big difference."}
{"text":"Love this place. Bbq pork rice, Chicken soy and Toufoo with mushrooms are really good. Staff are always friendly to us and go out of the way to serve us."}
{"text":"Had our fav Bbq pork rice and Chicken Soy rice. The Bbq pork was really good sorry to the other one at Lawrence this was so good. This restaurant is closer to place. Will be going for more often. Price is very reasonable.. It's busy and so go early."}
{"text":"This location was a surprise to me, even though I have been here a million times.  The location is also incredibly busy!  I was surprised how busy it was.  Nevertheless the wait time wasn't anything crazy.  We were able to find a table for 2 within a reasonable amount of time.   We ordered a few items, from each of the different food groups: pork, beef, chicken, you get the idea.  With all the food groups covered, we had a really enjoyable time.  The food was good, and the service was speedy.  The only drawback might have been the noise level, but there's not much you can do about that with a full restaurant on a very busy day."}
{"text":"Always the first choice for a family eat out when no one in the family feels like cooking haha. I can always expect consistent service, decent food (doesn't get too salty/oily/full of oyster sauce like some other Chinese restaurants) for a very reasonable price.  I will avoid the cheaper end of the menu(not the desserts) though, it gets very literal when it says something like\"oyster sauce and vegetables\""}
{"text":"I really like the decor of the restaurant it is very modern and I especially like the window where you can see the duck and pork hanging.  I drool every time I turn around.  The service was fast and friendly the dishes we ordered were great, my new favorite dish is the Singapore stir fry turnip radish cubes."}
{"text":"Very surprise to see such a clean and neat place for BBQ pork, duck etc.   Food - 4.5 starts Service - 5 starts"}
{"text":"Sorry everyone but I HAVE to post this review because of what happened today at just after lunch 1:00pm - ish.  I eat a fair bit at this restaurant (er I mean I did).  I live across the street.  A friend of mine dropped by for lunch and I recommended them as the food is tasty especially when eaten in the restaurant (normally I used take out)  We ordered 3 dishes and a couple rice bowls. After we started our meals I noticed out of the corner of my eye a dark object moving on the table but disappeared behind a cup (my friends reaction was enough for me to know what it was) I was trying to convince myself that what I saw was nothing but sadly a cockroach moved out from behind the cup (my friend half crushed it on the table with a cup). I pointed it out to the staff (it was still moving) and he scurried off to get a napkin to 'clean it up'.  We forced ourselves to finish the food, paid and left.  Only reason I'm posting is because we got no apology, no offer to move us or anything. They barely acknowledged it happened. (Wish we had photographed the bugger)  Sadly this is the last meal with them, sorry Congee Queen - evidently this is a common occurrence to your staff.  Service was always typical Chinese restaurant quality / but food was always good... So sad to see you go"}
{"text":"If you want fantastic chinese food that is at an affordable price this is the place to go.  I went with a friend and stuffed our faces all for $25 with included.  The servings are pretty big, and the service is more friendly that China Town and just as fast, if not more quick.  To compare it to China town, the food has more flavour and less greasy.  The atmosphere is more clean, and the prices are about the same and depending on the item possibly cheaper.  I would recommend if you're in the North York area, and craving some good Chinese dining definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Portions are big..House special congee is a bit bland.add your own soya sauce and pepper.sichuan stir fry chicken is good.salt and pepper garupa fish is yummy.would come again"}
{"text":"Usual food for a Chinese place but, too crowded and bad service."}
{"text":"The most flavourless food EVER ! Seriously where is the flavour ? Same with the one on finch by dvp. Never again . . ."}
{"text":"Freshly cooked food and their congee was the best.  Service was average but pricing was reasonable.  Good location lot of parking  space."}
{"text":"Portion size is huge and service is ultra quick.  Food comes to the table very quickly and is piping hot.  Menu is very extensive.  Flavours were good. A tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Uncomfortable booth seating if you're tall. medicore decor, and many flies bothering us during our meal."}
{"text":"Its probably the only Chinese restaurant I go to for casual lunch/dinner.   Food: tasty. Not too greasy. Large portion.  Environment: clean. Family oriented. Can be noisy at times but it is expected.  Services: mostly professional.  Ladies room: decent  Overall: better than most Chinese restaurants I have been to in GTA."}
{"text":"This location is crap compared to the Markham locations.  The bbq duck has more bone than meat and the bbq pork is really fatty.  It was decent here before but quality has declined in the past year."}
{"text":"Clean and modern decor.   Great service, attentive and friendly staff.  Generous portion sizes and delicious good.  Chinese dishes better than the Thai fusion offerings."}
{"text":"We went to a family dinner yesterday (Oct 25th - Saturday night) at the Markham Congee Queen with 8 adults and 4 young children, and the service was bad from the beginning. When we arrived at the table, there were brown leather chairs for all the adults other than another adult which they left a stool. Yes, a stool! This was practically the only stool in the restaurant and they decided to leave that as a chair for one of the adults in our group. I find that quite disrespectful, which put everyone in an awkward situation on who would be sitting on that chair. Eventually, we physically switched that chair to a brown leather chair ourselves.  That was just the beginning of the meal. After the meal, they gave us complimentary cold tapioca soup-based dessert only to the adults, leaving the young children without any dessert. We had to specifically request that additional dessert be brought for the young children. Then, the bill came and was left at our table, even though no one asked for the bill. At that point, everyone was just conversing, which people do at a restaurant!   Then as we were conversing, they started putting the dishes away. I was talking to my husband and they took his half finished cold dessert and dumped it with the other dirty dishes they were compiling. After he asked him where his dessert was, the lady went through the dirty bowls to find the bowl. As if, we still going to finish the dessert after part of it touched the dirty dishes and half of it spilled onto the dirty dishes.   I understand that there were people waiting to get seated, but that still doesn't justify the lack of respect and patience. We still tipped like everyone else there, but since they are in a rush, they do not care to provide decent service since people were waiting to get seated. It seems like this restaurant wants the quick turnover (aka money!) without providing respectful service to each customer who is there.   I give this restaurant at this location at big thumbs down and the lowest rating I have ever given to a restaurant. Being Chinese, I don't expect the best service sometimes at Asian restaurants; however, I haven't been treated this badly in a restaurant for a long time. We would not go back by ourselves, with a small group or a large group - never again. IF YOU DON'T MIND BEING RUSHED OUT WHILE YOU ARE STILL EATING, then this is the place for you. If you are like every other customer that would like respect when eating out, I'm sure you can find as equally good or better Chinese food with decent to good service elsewhere in Markham!!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant twice this week. Each time we had spoiled food.    The first time we had a bowl of congee with spoiled winter melon pieces.  We complained to the waitress and she came back and said the restaurant will give us a 10% discount.  We believed it was just a one time incident.  We then went back later in the week and ordered the sizzling chicken dish.  The dish was full of little broken bones and three pieces of chicken knuckles, even though a whole chicken should only have two knuckles.  That evening, I fell sick to my stomach.  We will never go back to this restaurant again.  Please be aware spoiled food can cause you to be very ill."}
{"text":"found hair in my sweet and sour chicken. enough said"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever!! The seafood udon over done, the udon was was soup and swimming in it , soft and mushy The chow mien - the meat was over seasoned with MSG!!! The Chef special fried rice had a load of dried preserved shrimp! Which stunk the entire dish ! If you're gonna garish something you have to let people know! My husband nearly threw up from the smell. The General Tao chicken was mush ! The broccoli was over soo over blanched, it was white and not green anymore. I called them and Told them and they wanted to give me a credit for my next meal. But why would I order something again when the chef overcooked and over seasoned every dish I ordered!!!! It's too bad they couldn't give me the credit to use at another location instead. Worst meal ever !!!! ;-((( lost my taste for Congee Queen"}
{"text":"Food: 4.5 stars Service: 3.75 stars Value: 4.5 stars  Congee Queen is definitely one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Toronto. I like the interior decoration and the ambiance. It is contemporary and everything looks clean. Although during peak hours, this place can be really crowded and seats/tables are a bit tight, I still like eating here.   We had dried oyster, vegetable and lean pork congee (CAD $5.25), fish congee (CAD $4.99), roasted duck and BBQ pork with honey combo (CAD $9.75), Chu-Hau beef brisket (CAD $4.95), stir-fried sticky rice (CAD $5.99), deep-fried crab claws (CAD $5.75), deep-fried shrimp wontons (CAD $5.25), and my be-loved deep-fried sweet cruller (CAD $1.60). All the food was really good. I especially loved the congee, soft and smooth with lots of ingredients. The deep-fried sweet cruller was crispy and delicious, even better than the ones I had in Hong Kong. And the stir-fried sticky rice was really tasty, the sticky rice was made perfectly. Oh so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Actual rating: 3.5  It's a full restaurant, but the turnover rate is quick. The food is flavourful, and portions tend to be generous. For our order, this was especially true for their fried rice and turnip patties. The waiter forgot about one of our items though, and wouldn't acknowledge the error."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am surprised by the amazing ratings here, because my meal tonight was not good.  I think the hallmark of a great Chinese restaurant is how they prepare vegetables. We ordered Mixed Vegetables in Garlic Sauce. They just boiled some vegetables and dropped them on a plate. No signs of a sauce or any flavouring for that matter. Super bland.  Their Chicken with Vegetables on Rice was inedible. There were literally 5 cups of plain white rice topped with a Chicken and Vegetable mixture that had no flavour, no je ne sais quoi. Nothing.  Then came the Pad Thai. Oh em gee. Why did I order Pad Thai at a Chinese Restaurant?!?!?! I knew better, I swear I did, but I was craving it. Oh forgive me Yelp gods, because this is one of the biggest food regrets I have of 2013. Word to the wise. Don't go there. Save yourself!  Dishes that bump my rating up to a 2 include the Cheong Fun and Ginger and Green Onion Lobster. Those were totally solid, however the lacklustre dishes above totally overshadowed them."}
{"text":"Try their afternoon tea special on weekdays from 3 pm to 5 pm. Most rice and noodles-based dishes come with free HK tea, coffee, lemon tea , bubble tea and red bean ice cream. Service tends to be slow since the waiters and waitresses are usually having their late lunch . Do check out what they are eating as the food do look delicious and has a home cook feel to it!  Overall. still a pleasant eating experience and the waiters and waitresses are generally friendly!"}
{"text":"This place has been my go to Chinese restaurant for the past while. Highly recommended are the empress fried rice (bbq eel with bonito flakes), fried chili turnips, deep fried squid, minced pork and salted fish eggplant, etc. Lots of great choices on the menu and doesn't cease to disappoint. Compared to Congee Wong and Congee Time, Congee Queen is the winner with higher quality and more unique offerings on their menu."}
{"text":"Food was delicious as usual, didn't have to wait long for the food to come, however, we had a surprise in our congee - a screw!  Had told the waiter of our surprise, best thing he offered was to take it off our bill ... took the screw and the bowl of congee away and didn't get a single apology from the manager or anyone else for the fact."}
{"text":"Congee Queen was one of the few restaurants that started the modern chinese cuisine craze.  The decors, menu and service reflect this modernization.  Don't let the name fool you.  This place goes well beyond Congee."}
{"text":"Service is the worst... Called in the morning for a 5:30 pm reservation for 12 ppl Sunday evening.   When we arrived they gave us a small table not big enough and also put 6 wooden stools to cram us all in this really small table. We complained and the the only thing they did was remove the stools and put regular chairs and made the space fit for sardines.  We ordered and the food of course did not fit on the table.  Food was stacked over each other.   Such a bad experience.   I gave 2  stars for the food quality and taste.   It was OK.   Skip this location coz other Congee Queen are so much better.  Definitely not recommended.  Manager no where to be found. ."}
{"text":"Paid $15 for a bowl of congee but they refused to give 3 vinegar on side. People are not so welcoming"}
{"text":"I went to Congee Queen on Dec 9th. I ordered mushroom and egg noodle soup. The soup was served in about 10 minutes. It looked nice with a lot of fresh vegetables in it. Then I noticed a dark spot in my soup. When I looked closer, it was a BUG! I could clearly see the legs and wings. I asked to see the manager. He came and asked if he could help us with anything. I said there was a bug in my soup. He looked at me and said: do you want me to bring you another one? Didn't apologize. I said: from the same pot? He said: we don't make pots of soup... still didn't apologize. I said: you don't look very concerned about this. I feel it's something normal here. He said: things like this happen... it's not that I am not concerned. Still didn't apologize! Then I said: please cancel my order. He took the soup away and finally at the end said, very softly, that he was sorry. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!  Here is a picture of my soup with the bug in it."}
{"text":"Most of all the foods on the menu tastes great , the service portion is lacking but overall a fine place to eat."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is hands down the best diner-style Chinese restaurant in Toronto. Price, portions, speed, taste, hours, selection. The. Best. I don't live nearby anymore. I still come back.  Yes, the tastiest foods here are a little greasy. There are many non-greasy options. Yes, sometimes you have to wave servers over to your table. Yes, if you come at peak times it will be busy and sluggish. But the servers here aren't rude like at many other Chinese restaurants.   I've been coming here since it opened, and I've never been disappointed with anything on the menu. The BBQ meats are excellent be it duck, pork or roast pork, but don't complain if it's a little dry by the end of the night. Turnip patties are a favourite, salt and pepper squid is hangover-style awesome (best split among 3+). Singapore style noodles have just the right amount of spice, noodle rolls, donut sticks and congee are all just right and brought out fast. Though I've tried most of the menu, I don't usually order many of the \"advanced\" HK foods, but companions have always been pleased.  The \"fusion\" items are a little pricier but also taste great, like mango chicken and satay skewers.  I find it best to stay away between 12-1pm and 6-7pm on weekends. And the food at the \"flagship\" restaurant at Steeles & Don Mills is never quite as good as the Lawrence location. Not a big difference, but if you go here enough, you'll notice."}
{"text":"We called and ordered squid tentacle take out and another dish to take to someone's house. It was ready for us when we arrived.  My spouse told me it was $10.99 which I thought was expensive. I've been having a lot of dim sum lately and always order the tentacles. This was B-. I've had better and I have had worse, but it was adequate. I did not try the other dish.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"This is the first Congee Queen that I've been to and I really liked it. The portions were big and pretty inexpensive. The food was flavourful. Service was very fast and the servers were attentive. Cute atmosphere. Even though it was an early Thursday afternoon, the place was still decently packed. We couldn't complete our meals and what was left in the take out containers looked like it was enough to feed another 2 people. I would definitely come again or order take out since this is probably a hot spot on weeknights and weekends."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon, I get talked into going to work with my SO to \"help him with some things\" Three hours of moving things around a warehouse and breaking down boxes and I am HUNGRY for Chinese food. Needless to say, I got to pick what I wanted, and I decided on Congee.   I became Congee-converted in Macau and have loved it ever since.   I have visited the other Congee Queen location (highway 7) , which I enjoyed as well, but I thought this one was just a little bit better. Both locations, hot tea arrives at your table before you do, which is fantastic, and it is refilled constantly.   We ordered the month's highlight salt and pepper Garoupa. Personally, I like the Sweet and Sour Garoupa better, and the salt and pepper squid, but that is a matter of taste.  We also ordered General Tao Chicken (which had a very Gloopy Cornstarchy sauce but came with a full serving of rice included) and the Assorted Fungas and 6 grain Congee with Brown Rice, Barley, French Red Rice, Rye Berries, Purple Barley and Japanese Rice. It was DELICIOUS and had just the right texture.  FULL STAR for the 6 Grain Congee.    Just note that the Salt and Pepper Garoupa is not spicy at all.   Clean, hot Tea, Food comes quick, servers are not overly pleasant but who cares. Food is good and decently priced."}
{"text":"A review on takeout. This was our first place to eat in our Canadian tour. The mister's aunt told us to eat there. At two on a Saturday afternoon, there was a wait to be seated. The mister had no patience and wanted to do take out. The mister saw a hamburger joint next door and was debating to go there. But his uncle refused and did the ordering for us. He ordered 2 dishes, stir fried chili turnips and beef chow fun.    This is where the place loses stars. The takeout order takes more than 20 mins! We saw people sitting down and getting their food during that time frame as we were waiting. The uncle complained that eating in was quicker than taking out. Go figure. He had to track down any waiter to check up on this order. I waited in the back of the restaurant and observed the surroundings. The restaurant has an energetic vibe and a modern ambiance. People are willing to wait for a table here and the prices are very reasonable.   We took the food back and it was very good. Beef chow fun is definitely Hong Kong style, which the mister loves. The turnips with chilis was very delish! This unique dish is tasty and flavorful, and with the chili spice, not spicy at all.  I haven't stumbled upon any dishes back home that is similar to that. These two dishes were delish but next time I will wait for the food in Congee Queen."}
{"text":"My friends (three of us) went for lunch at Congee Queen near East Beaver creek last Friday Sept 16. All of us got sick afterward... Vomit, diarrhea and stomach pain. There must be something wrong with the lunch specials. I would highly recommend to avoid this restaurant going forward. ,"}
{"text":"Big bowls of congee to keep you full and satisfied. You can't go wrong with this restaurant. They have so many different types from salmon to abalone to chicken, so basically anything you could want with your congee."}
{"text":"Ah memories of Macau. The first time I ever had Congee. An acquired taste for sure but I like it. Markham has a couple options for Congee, but this is definitely one of the more popular options. They have a full dinner menu, and takeout menu as well.  I have had dinner offerings and breakfast here (Congee)  For dinner, I really enjoyed the Sweet and Sour and Spicy Salt Garoupa. Both lightly fried and not oily. Vegetarians take note The Fukien Style Soft Bean Curd was a little glutenous for my liking, and came doused in chicken, seafood and green peas. The Chow Mein is my SOs favorite, and more reasonably priced than downtown Toronto http://www.yelp.ca/biz/new-sky-restaurant-toronto. They will, however, make things without chicken if you ask, no problem.  The Congee is very good. Prepared with a fish based stock, and not chicken - for all of the pescatarians out there (self included) On last visit I enjoyed the Mixed Mushroom and Bean Curd sprinkled with white pepper. It could have used some spring onions on top, and next time I will be asking for some for sure. I sampled my SOs Shrimp Congee which had some brightness thanks to fresh herbs. My serving of Congee which I could not even finish was $4.50.   You can order Congee in Family Style bowls for $12 or so, and split between several diners.   There also is a \"healthy\" Congee made of a myriad of healthy whole grains (Brown Rice, Hulled Barley, French Red Rice, Rye Berries, Purple Barley, Japanese Rice) and fungus which I cannot wait to try next time.    Bonus Star - On last visit, a server came around with full tea pots checking and replacing each tables. We were never without hot tea. Nice touch. Nice Decor, excellent service."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant all the time and usually everytime it's great. But today is the reason why I'm leaving this negative review.   I had ordered around 5 dishes which were all great, except the Lobster. The lobster's texture was flimsy and not really like normal. Usually, fresh lobster can come out in one piece and is firm. So I asked two servers if by any chance, this lobster was not fresh or something, and if they helped me and even \"investigated\" a little, I would've been happy. But, both of them were stubborn and would not help out. The restaurant was busy but for alot of the time we were there, there were many servers just standing and conversing with each other.  Hopefully next time will be a better experience."}
{"text":"Great for takeout. Recommend the crispy chicken, salty fish fried rice and the  fried spicy turnip. For desert try the golden milk cubes.  Seafood is fresh not frozen. They do delivery in their designated area within 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant but did not try the take out service.  This time we called and ordered our dinner.  By the time 15 minutes later that we arrive to pick up our food, they are ready to be picked up at the counter.  As usual for a weekend, there are lots of people lining up.  We just squeeze through the crowd and go straight to the counter.  The cashier is very busy.  We pay for the food after checking against the order list.  This is a precaution not to pick up the incorrect order as there are take out lining up.  The cashier is real nice and always gives a smile.  The Fried Chili Turnip Patties is not as good as dine in.  The Chef Special Fried Rice with Scallop, Shrimp, BBQ pork and Preserved Sausage has its specialty but has different ingredients than the other restaurant if you do not read the description in English and order it under the Chinese name.  The Dried oyster, dried vegetable and pork congee is very good.  With 5 dishes and only cost us less than $45 is very affordable."}
{"text":"1/19/2012 Whenever in this area, this is one of the congee place that we will visit.  The house fried vermicelli and the fired turnip patties are the common dishes that we usually order.  They don't disappoint every time.  It is always nearly full.  So unless necessary we will go there after the dinner time.  The service is on average.  It is a family restaurant.   3/30/2014 What happens to Congee Queen!!!   After having dinner there with Congee, XO sauce turnip cake, vege and fried vermicelli, we are all thirsty for the whole night lingering into the next day. Did it change the oil or MSG?"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to dinner at this restaurant at 5:15 pm and we were one of the first customers to be seated.  The food was good but the following rated 0 stars: 1. I had to call a waiter to place our order 2. The waiter never returned once to ask if everything was okay 3. I had to called someone over to ask for my bill Our total for 2 persons was close to 50CND I mentioned the lack of service to the person accepting my payment and she mentioned they were understaffed and additional help would come in at 6:00 pm. The restaurant was almost entirely full at this time. Go elsewhere if service is important."}
{"text":"I don't normally write negatives reviews about a restaurant, but I was really disappointed today with my takeout order. For $10 I ordered the sweet and sour pork with rice. And this is what I got, the box was completely packed with rice with only a few pieces of pork and veggie. Literally 90% and 10% meat/veggie  Is this their strategy of expanding their chain?"}
{"text":"I generally like congee places, but if I got to choose, Congee Queen is my pick. The overall food quality is better - I love the \"fried noodles with three shredded ingredients\" (lol is that what it's called..). The sauce isn't too watery and they give you plenty of meats. They have the crunchies on the side and it's nice and soft in the middle.   The congee is great as well. Not too watery, just enough rice in it. Nice and soft too, and a lot of variety.   Presentation of the food is generally good. They tend to have newer cutlery and the whole place just seems cleaner than other congee places.   The only negative thing is the service. As with many other Chinese restaurants, it's either you get your food fast or you never get it at all. The bright side is, at this particular location, they'll give you free dessert as an apology. =)"}
{"text":"Writing an update on Congee Queen, I'm glad to report that it's still consistently good even after couple of years.   The chairs have gotten roughed up along the edges but the place maintains a clean and modern feel. Great choice for family gatherings.    Anyways, the food is superb!!  Today we ordered a shrimp congee, house special vermicelli, and lemon chicken.. result?  everything was spiced, breaded and salted  bang on the chefs know how to prepare, (just note though:  this is east coast so don't come in expecting the freshest seafood.  frozen shrimps and scallops but preparation was good.)  We've been coming here over the years I've noticed the specials menu changes every so often and now noticed they have added lunch combos. I'm glad to see a restaurant making these changes, subtle but regular patrons notice. There are too many restaurants out there that just offer the same boring menu day in and day out.   Oh if you were wondering about the Congee.. after all it's in their restaurant name.. it's as smooth as silk. :)  Congee Queen is a definite recommend"}
{"text":"We had a take-out order of Cantonese chow mein, stir fried mixed veggies, pork spareribs with honey and beef brisket on rice.  The weakest of the four dishes was the ribs--small portion, tasteless and a tiny container of what I assume was honey.  The next dish was the Cantonese chow mein--a very lacklustre effort.  The veggies were ok but the portion was quite small.  The beef brisket was good.  I know this place enjoys a good reputation but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"They charge a dollar for a slice of lemon?   Wheres the hidden camera?? Is this a joke?"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Congee Queen franchise. I've been to the Congee Queen on Steeles and Don Mills and Markville location a million times so I used those locations as comparisons.   I went at lunch on a weekday. The parking lot was really busy (likely because of the mall) but it wasn't busy inside. The space is large with 2 sides and beautifully decorated.  We ordered Singapore noodles, Cantonese chow mein, roasted pork and their signature Congee Wong super bowl, and found the food quality to be the same as other locations. The roasted pork skin was really crispy, the portions were big, and the dishes were flavourful.  I'll be back when I'm in the area. Price is reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Food was okay...the reason for giving them one star is because the service is TERRIBLE.  Needless to say im not returning"}
{"text":"Great variety of food, tastes good and good portions! Would recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"we came here for dinner because it got 4 stars on yelp.  it was around 5:45 when we arrived and it was super packed.    1. spicy eggplant with minced pork - this was very very bad.  not the typical sweet and spicy flavor we are accustomed to.  the portion was huge but flavor was really off.  it was barely touched. 2. fish and tofu hotpot - this had no flavor as well.  we expected this to be very saucy and tasty where you could eat a bowl of white rice with it.  again, a very disappointing dish. 3. beef with gailan - this was up to par.  best dish we ordered. 4. salt and pepper fried squid - not salty not spicy not very good.   5. pork and preserved egg congee - congee and other ingredients seemed to be cooked separately while the congee was bland but the pork and preserved egg were way too salty.  overall, the portion was big and good for family to share.  but don't come here if you are looking for real good flavorful food.  everything was bland bland bland.  we left this place in anger and dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"Decent food. Sometimes really good, other times just okay. We always get turnip cakes  which are usually crunchy rather than soggy as at the other locations. The congee with mushrooms and barley is also really good. This is probably my favourite of all the locations. There is a lot of MSG though so be sure to drink lots of water."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place in Markham.  You can tell the owner(s) put a lot of thought into the restaurant.  Here's why:  Decor - simple yet classy, with mirrors on both sides making the interior appear bigger.  Service - Extremely friendly wait staff with clean black uniforms.  Menus - The menu blew me away.  Seeing the enticing photos as I leaf through the menu made me want to order EVERYTHING that was photographed. The material that the menus were printed was very nice to the touch as well.  Design - Love their logo of the queen eating congee, the place mats, the presentation of the dishes (every dish comes with a plate to hold the dish, a very nice touch).  It's too bad we only dropped by for a quick bite and only got two dishes - the six grain congree and shrimp flour roll.  Six Grain Congee - Very subtle flavour with the grains adding texture to the otherwise bland taste of congee.  Shrimp Flour Roll - possibly the best I've had.  The flour was soft and what distinguished this for me is that the shrimp was marinated.  Again, the attention to detail sets this place apart.  The sweetened soya sauce completed this perfect dish.  I would like to return and try the other dishes from the wide array of menu items.  I much prefer this place over Congee Wong."}
{"text":"Great place!  Portion sizes are larger when you dine-in versus take-out, and the prices are decent.  I usually dine here on weekends, and the service is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Go to place, if you want very typical Cantonese cuisine. BBQ duck, pork, congee, turnip cake, fried rice, Cantonese chow mein. They cook it fast and the food is consistent. The taste is on point. I see quite a few US visitors come here for food.   It get busy at times but haven't really been disappointed by this place. Typical Chinese service.  Must order:  -Super bowl wintermelon congee -BBQ pork (ask for a fatty piece) you won't be disappointed. Lean is slightly too dry -BBQ duck (quite tasty) -Turnip cake. I ask them to cook it with a bit more crispy exterior. -fried squid"}
{"text":"My family and I come here about once every two weeks, and for a good reason!   One thing I love about this Congee Queen location is that it is consistent. The food and service has always been good, repeatedly, time after time.   Their chili fried turnip cakes, dough fritter, vegetarian six grain fried rice are our family favourites! The quality of food is great, and priced reasonably.  The service is fast and efficient.   We usually go on the weekdays for dinner when there aren't much line ups. But if you're looking to come here Fri- Sun, I'd suggest making reservations as it can be quite packed.   Overall, great food and service at this location. I highly recommend trying this place if you haven't already!  4/5!"}
{"text":"From my California abode, I was able to successfully organize a kid-friendly extended family luncheon in Scarborough thanks to Congee Queen.  Their online party tray menu and helpful managers (Henry and Ken), made order placement and confirmation in English very easy and error-free.  As I scanned their notes, they apparently also have some of the neatest Chinese handwriting that I've ever had the pleasure of trying to read.  :)  With 10 items on our large order of party trays, and a very tight timeline on the day of our party, their execution was flawless.  Thanks to their timeliness (and location), my car was quickly loaded mid-day right outside their front door without incurring any parking citation or the wrath of other drivers.  The food was of course well received by attendees -- yum!  Everyone (except us out of towners) is familiar with Congee Queen so of course we had no trouble off-loading leftovers.    That said, if you're willing to shop around, enjoy working around surprises, and want the challenge of dealing with cultural differences, you can probably find better pricing, but not necessarily peace of mind and patient pleasant helpful interactions with staff.  I understand that some people prefer to complain after the fact, rather than ante up the cost of quality service and best practices.  I do feel that we definitely got what we paid for and I would be happy to do it all over again... even if my mom continues to talk about \"better deals\" at restaurants that I have concerns just stepping into.  :P"}

{"text":"We meant to visit this place since day one arriving to Toronto (GTA) and finally got to drop by on a Saturday night just hours before our scheduled departure.  The place was located in a safe area yet busy looking plaza despite being 11:00PM at night.  From the outside of the glass wall, I could see the place was in full swing of activity which was always a good sign of a restaurant.  We were seated in no time and the assigned server was checking on us regularly waiting to take our orders.  Their prices were good compared to other typical chinese places of the same category, but their portion size is very generous--about twice the size of other places.  Everything was delicious and tasted right.  We were pleased with the food, service, and atmosphere here.  We definitely would come back to this place given the opportunity.  TIPS:   Order and ask for everthing you may need while the servers are at your table.  Once they move on, it's hard to get their attention again--that is very typical behavior of chinese restaurants in Toronto.    If they place a printed menu + pen/pencil at your table, that usually means that you need to mark down your own order and they will be back to collect and confirm your order.  If you wait too long after marking down the order, just wave at them with your paper order.  That's a universal language of \"come and take my order\".  If you can speak chinese, that is a plus to get good service.  All the chinese restaurants but one we visited in Toronto only accepted cash and  this seemed to be the trend in Toronto as far as Asian establishment go.  If they can do good business without paying 1-3% to credit card companies, why would they want to change?  So....do yourselves a favor and ask first before siting down.  Yes, cash is still king in Asian community in the 21st century"}
{"text":"Good food, horrible service  As a US visitor to Toronto, my wife and I found this establishment through Yelp and the reviews were decent so we decided to take a shot.  The food is indeed good and the quantity is impressive. We dropped by this place a couple of times.  The regular sized congee can be shared with two.  The shrimp and beef rice noodle fun (dim sum dish) were exceptional. I was impressed with the size of the shrimp and the beef's complex flavor.   On a dinner visit, the hotpot rice (which takes a 20 min wait) was not remarkable. It was underflavored.  The Chef's Special fried rice was good but the fried tofu and vegetables made up for the hotpot rice.   Now for the service - it's bad. The young staff that simply seemed to be trained to clean tables and take orders were running around without order. There wasn't a wait person per table and subsequently many diners were visibly frustrated at getting noticed to order or call for the check. Small things like an empty teapot was immediately addressed.  However, there was no checking up on the table to ask if everything was adequate.      It was a frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is definitely a good place to get some really good tasting Chinese food, and because it has so much variety (HUGE menu!) its easy to find something to please everyone if you are coming here with a group.   The service isn't the friendliest, but it is really quick and efficient so I didn't mind at all that my waitress didn't bother with pleasantries and small talk. The restaurant itself is really big, bright and clean - it doesn't have much going on on the decor department, but I don't mind that either.   We chose the Crispy Cantonese Chow Mein, BBQ Spareribs, Spicy Crab fried rice and the Spice and Pepper Salt Squid - More than enough food for the 4 of us. The food was all pretty good, and I particularly enjoyed the squid which was just delicious! The Chow Mein was also really good, but I was left a little disappointed with the fried rice. The \"crab\" in it didn't really taste like crab, plus it was battered and deep fried and it just made the dish feel too heavy. The spareribs were fine - but I've had better.   All in all, we enjoyed our meal, and this place is definitely worth repeat visits. That Spicy Squid alone is worth repeat visits - SOOO good!   The food here is affordable and totally worth the quality and quantity you are getting. I recommend checking this place out if you are in the area and in the mood for some good Chinese."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food I've ever had!  Everything was fresh and hot. Every meal we got was delicious. We definitely bought way to much which we brought home and ate it the next day so it was definitely not a bad thing to over order. They gave us hot tea which very much complemented the meal.  Definitely would come here with friends."}
{"text":"Located close to home and more of a popular restaurant in Markham/Toronto area, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed at this restaurant!   Interior had a very wide opened concept and had the usual loud environment - being it a typical Chinese restaurant. We arrived around 5:40pm on its 3rd night of opening. It was quite quiet at the time of arrival, but soon the restaurant got louder and filled up by 6:30pm. Alot of hustling waiters & waitresses scurrying beside every table and the hostess shouting out numbers.   The food arrived quick & hot!! The food we got didn't disappoint, especially in comparison to its other locations. ONLY one thing that knocked off my one star was this one falsely advertised dish that my family ordered. It was one of the \"Queen's Specials\" called Crab Meat & Vegetarian Shark Fin served with Conpoy Rice In Chicken Broth - what a mouthful. The photo showed big chunks of crab meat, yet when it arrived there wasn't any at all. I thought they perhaps forgot to add it in, so I brought it to a waitress' attention. She brought the menu and stated that it is crab meat but it is shredded into the broth. Honestly, it was shredded to nothing especially if you were to compare it to the menu photo.  Other than that, all the staff was attentive & spoke both Chinese & English. The hostess rapidly promptly wrapped up our leftovers and created small conversation! Overall, it was a great experience here! I will definitely return and perhaps order food that I know are delicious at their other locations!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food at a fair price, offering great variety for all taste buds. I usually rely on takeout  from this place since the restaurant is extremely noisy and chaotic.  I have also tried their other location at Centerpoint mall  but the quality of food there is mediocre, so we stick to the takeout option from the Steeles location."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 came here for lunch.  Food is typical Asian fare although their menu indicates they have \"new taste\" section where some of the traditional dishes are experimental with some ingredients.  I think the size of the dishes are average.  We ordered Singapore vermicelli, fried donut, chow mein, a meat dish and fried taro cake.  It came to like $6-7 for each us when the bill came.  I'd probably come again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Friend took me here for dinner the other day...   Congee was sooo good.  Affordable, busy and clean!"}
{"text":"My friends brought me here today and I was not disappointed. We had three dishes, all of which were yummy.  The sizzling beef dish was amazing! I enjoyed the bit of char on the veggies and the beef was cooked just perfectly. The mushrooms were cooked just right as well. It wasn't mushy or raw. We also had the smoked salmon fried rice which was pretty good considering that I'm not a fan of smoked salmon. (Although we think that the staff forgot to put it into the system because we had to ask if it was coming and the woman looked at us like she knew she forgot). We got a tofu dish with some veggies and that was pretty good too. The tofu was deep fried but thankfully, not fried to the point where the middle melted into nothing like you might get at Korean BBQ.  The staff was prompt and friendly enough and even asked if I needed a fork which is nice I suppose but I do know how to work a pair of chopsticks.   Definitely would go back again to try some new dishes."}
{"text":"I come here for the fried turnips. Hands down. Enough said. Now try it!  The congee is pretty good here too. I only came here twice but the food has not disappoint. More of an upscale Chinese restaurant. Great with family, friends, the usual."}
{"text":"Nice desserts, large portion, good price and food comparing with similar restaurants. The food are not the best, but worth that price. Went their several times through out many years, always kept up the same quality. Service is OK, not outstanding but never been bad.   P.S. This is a 4.5"}
{"text":"Coming from someone that been to a few congee queens, this one isn't any different in terms of food and quality: quite standard and delicious. HOWEVER... the time to wait for a seat can get ridiculous. I've only been to this location twice and both times I waited 30min for 4 ppl and 1.5hr for 6. I'd go here again but I'm hesitant to go during busy hours. They need to open another one in sauga quick!!!"}
{"text":"We woke up too late to catch dim sum so we came here instead. We weren't disappointed, in fact we made the best and ordered a lot and it was really yummy! We had to go out for a walk since our tummies were so happy.  house special congee. salt pepper squid.  seafood udon. tomato and coconut milk rice and shrimp. bbq duck with noodle.  server was helpful when we ordered two bowls of congee to share so we took her suggestion and only got one bowl since we got so much other food.  We were here early for lunch and we were glad cuz even though the place is big, it still filled up fast!  I would come here again!"}
{"text":"The service is good for a very busy Chinese restaurant. They gave you a lot of food for the price. All the food item we ordered are above average. I love the fact that they have revolving door, so that the cold does not come in when people go in and out; and they also have a large waiting area which is really a life safer when you have to wait for 20 min with the deep freeze outside."}
{"text":"I frequent this joint all the time... But one thing I have to mention is that HOLY Shit! This place has the WORST service ever. Great food, but DO NOT and I really emphasized this, DO NOT expect any service. The servers aren't rude, they are polite but don't give a fuck.  It's a great place if you want some food asian comfort food. My friends and I always split a superbowl between the 3 of us with the fried bread. It's pretty filling and ends up costing around $6 per person with tip. Try the cantonese chow mein or the taiwanese stir fry. Those 2 my favourite dishes besides the congee.  The service is deplorable however. One time it took us 27 mins to be served after being seated. We got bored so we actually timed it. Luckily we all have phones so we were playing on them to pass the time. After all that time the manager actually came over and asked us if they've taken our order. We just laughed (What else can you do) and he gave us a discount. This place is the only asian place that does not want to take your money. It takes them forever to give you the bill, and even longer to bring back change.  Hey if you want some good congee, or decent chinese food this is the place to go. But be prepared to disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Had hot and sour soup with shrimp and pork: 4/5, spicy pepper and salt squid: 4/5, sizzling beef and mushrooms: 5/5, shrimp and chive rice noodle roll: 5/5, fried rice noodle roll with XO sauce: 3/5 (needed some more XO sauce). The overall experience was great, and service was quick and the food came in no time (despite the fact that the place was packed). We found our new go- to spot for high quality Chinese food :)"}
{"text":"One of the better chain Chinese food places. I find the quality and taste here decent, while not the best Chinese food, you can't beat the price.  Definitely a place you can afford to go to a lot and not get tired of it!"}
{"text":"Very spacious and clean. Great tasting congee better than congee wong.  Prices are very reasonable with generous portions. Menu is similar to any chinese restaurant, but I find it much cleaner.   Expect to wait for a table on the weekends around lunch time.  Love the fried turnip!"}
{"text":"Great place for late night eats,  special congee is loaded with shrimp and beef balls. gota try the turnip cake"}
{"text":"One thing that I love about this place would be their wide variety and large selection of foods. For example, their noodle dishes have many different choices that can accommodate to all my friends' needs and wants. Service is decent and decor and overall feel of the restaurant is pleasant. Food is delicious, I would recommend the seafood chow mein, smoked salmon fried rice, and any of their delicious congee bowls. Loved it here and I'm sure you guys will love it too!!"}
{"text":"I drive across the border just for congee, and this place ABSOLUTELY hits the spot. It's hard to imagine anyone hating on the food here, all of the two times I've been here, everything has been spot on. That said, we only ordered the congee, fritters, and fried turnip cakes both times. We also ordered the Cantonese chow mein when I was here the first time, which was great. But those chili fried turnip cakes tho. I'm sure somewhere and sometime, someone has killed for those. Such small, flavorful, perfectly fried nuggets of starchy excellence. Would be a top contender for the last thing I eat on earth.  Decor is modern and clean. The space is spacious and parking aplenty. Servers are brisk and efficient. Price is very reasonable, especially factoring for the USD to CAD exchange rate. (Sorry Canadian comrades.)"}
{"text":"I've been to many of the different Congee places including Congee Star, Wong, Time, etc. Everytime I go to this place the food in incredible, hot, and comes out extremely fast. I go to Chinatown often as I live downtown and have my favorites restaurants there, but sometimes if I want a bit of everything and know its going to be awesome, I go to Congee Queen. I usually start off with a bowl of shredded pork and preserved egg congee with a bit of pepper or chili oil and the fried donut to dip. Then we usually get a veggie which always ends up being Chinese Brocoli with garlic sauce which is always hot and crunchy, and always has enough sauce to cover everything. We usually always get a rice and one of my favorites there is the salted fish and chicken fried rice that I can never get enough of. Then there is one of my favorites and a must everytime I go which is the Bbq pork with honey sauce. I've had Bbq pork in many places all over Toronto but they do this very well. Everytime I've ordered this they give me a huge portion with lots of honey drizzled on top and plenty on the bottom to dip each piece in if you want more. For dessert I really enjoy the golden milk pudding with sugar on top.  When I go to a Chinese restaurant I don't go for polite service I go for the quick service and hot food. This place seems to be able to even provide great customer service each time I go, and the staff always seem very friendly."}
{"text":"Great chinese food at great prices. Only in Toronto.  Seafood congee and the lobster noodles are must haves.  The fried turnip pieces are pretty sweet too.  Everything else we had was better than average too.   I came during the holidays and a reservation is a must.  They got extremely crowded around 730pm.    Yes, the servers aren't all fussy and nice like you'd expect at American/Canadian restaurants, but they are not that bad for an asian place.  Total damage for 5 people was about $70 with 3 left over boxes. Not bad."}
{"text":"Came to Congee Queen on a Saturday afternoon. Called ahead, so my party of 3 was seated upon arrival. Very busy on weekends with lines out the door.  Food: - vermicelli noodles 3.5/5 -char sui pork 4/5 - sweet and sour chicken 4/5 - fried spicy turnip capes 3.5/5 (make it crispier!) -shrimp congee 4/5 (fresh shrimp) -sizzling plate with beef and mushrooms 4.5 (you can taste the ginger!) -Salt and pepper calamari 3.5/5 (too chewy)  Everything was fresh and hot. I wish they would have sent dishes as they were made, instead of ALL AT ONCE. I mean, that's cool too, but it was overwhelming.  $85 after taxes for 3 people, with tons of leftovers. Congee Queen remains to be consistent in my books in terms of quality, price, and service."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Congee Queen since its inception at the Steeles/404 location, and I'm excited that a new location opened up closer to home! Generally, I've had nothing short of great experiences with the food. Always consistent, delicious, and worth the price. The service however... can be a hit or miss. Sometimes, it takes forever to flag down a server, but when you finally get their attention, they address your needs quickly and right down to the t. The reason as to why I'm giving this review 4 stars instead of the full 5, is because I ordered some takeout last week, and they forgot something in my order, only to find out once I arrived home. This was really disappointing, but I've let it go!"}
{"text":"We had a phenomenal family meal at this restaurant to celebrate my brother in law's 40th bday. The food was incredible, especially the Hong Kong style lobster dish. The service was quick and attentive. The food was tasty and hot. All in all, a really great evening!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for a meal, especially for big groups and families, though also works well for singles and couples. Absolutely love nearly everything I've tried here, which has been quite a variety of plates, although I'm not too big of a fan of their sea food dishes. Their food is very well priced and served fairly quickly, especially for such a busy place.  Come a bit early, as this place can get quite busy, and it's not abnormal to have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. Definitely worth the wait, though."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is alway the place I go for congee.  Great service and quality.. Price is very reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this restaurant for many years and it is consistently excellent.   The congee--the restaurant's namesake--is beautiful and the Chinese equivalent of matzoh ball and chicken soup (when it comes to warming the kishkes and making you feel good inside...not in flavour or consistency).  The green beans with pork, olive and dried fish is fantastic. That flavour combination is incredible. The lo meins are good and you can have a lot of fun with the lobster lo mein--good value.  The yeung chow fried rice is great, as are the taro dumplings (eat-in only as they won't keep their light gelatinous feel if you get them to go). Shrimp dumplings\" Go for it. The barbecued duck and pork is made with some kind of hint of anise. If you don't like licorice, you'll probably not notice, but if you do? Watch it, or you'll quickly become addicted.  This place is great for lunch or dinner. I like the lunchtime atmosphere a bit better as there is a lot of natural daylight and the decor is very clean and inviting.  The staff are young and very professional. They mean business, which is appreciated in a restaurant that has serving large groups down to a science. Don't worry if you go as a couple or in a group of 15--you'll be served quickly and attentively.  The take-out option is a good one and they are equally professional. This is a marvellous restaurant and worth the trip. It makes those Chinese restaurants on Spadina look positively amateur."}
{"text":"This location is one of their biggest locations with private rooms and live seafood. Even though it's so big, there's usually a wait time, but much shorter than other locations.   The food is always quick and on point. They have so much variety on the menu and all of it is super tasty. Their rice rolls are actually much better than many other dim sum places! Freshly rolled annd super silky!   The service is average, but the waiters are all very efficient."}
{"text":"Great Chinese comfort food. Lobster runs out a lot so come early if you want to order it. Fried turnip cake is my favourite dish! Fish congee is delicious too!"}
{"text":"Haven't found a better congee place yet. Been many times, food is consistent. For a chinese restaurant, service is good. Turnip patties and spicy beef rice noodles are my fav!  Recommended."}
{"text":"Very similar to the other congee places. Good food, fair prices, speedy service.   Would recommend and come again."}
{"text":"Menu is identical to the one on Steeles and the 404. Though I prefer the ambiance of the Steeles location better, bigger and less cramped.  So far, still the best c congee and noodle place!"}
{"text":"I've actually been here so many times in the past that eating at this restaurant feels almost like eating at home. The menu is extremely long, so just stick to the basics (see helpful pictures of other reviews) and you'll have a great time. Service? Next to non-existent, and normally I would drop more stars for that, but I'm so familiar with the attitude of the waiters here that I don't even care anymore."}
{"text":"I love this place, their food and services are good!!  The food come fast once you ordered them. And because there is always long line up for tables, you must come earlier for dinner (like around 6pm) ; otherwise you will need to wait for at least 10-20 mins until you sit down and eat.  The only thing that I don't really like is the music inside the restaurant is sometimes too loud, and when the restaurant is full, it's quite noisy with people's chatting.  The food: I highly recommended their BBQ pork, and duck, it's really yummy!  Their fried noodles and specialities are all very good , a must try!! :)  Better go before lunch hour (before noon) or before 6:30pm to get a table, or it will be very crowded for line up and extremely noisy inside !!"}
{"text":"All the Congee Queens have the same menu and recipe but for some reason, this location just doesn't taste right. The meat wasn't marinated enough. The congee was super thick. The noodles were a little dry.  Would probably not be back at this location ever again."}
{"text":"There's something for everyone! From congee to chinese bbq to pad thai! Huge portions and reasonably priced! Everything is delicious. My personal favourites are the crispy tiger shrimp & mango salad in custard sauce, house seafood & mixed vegetable fried taiwanese vermicelli, and steamed plain rice rolls.   Highly recommend congee queen if you've never been!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all. I found the fried rice super mushy and everything was just kind of gloppy and muddy in flavour. I've had better Chinese food at the Mandarin."}
{"text":"Great quality Chinese food! The only thing is, it gets really busy so be ready to wait!   Other than that.. this place is fantastic, a lot of choices to choose from on the menu and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food in Markham hands down! Tasty and authentic. Don't bother with other places that serve French fries and pizza lol"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite place in GTA. It's inexpensive, nice, and better than a lot of the fancier Chinese restaurant.   Their dishes are generous and made to order. A bowl of congee can serve 2-3 people easily. I always end up getting too much food. They do use flavor enhancer (a.k.a MSG)  like most restaurant, but they can skip it for some food by request.   They lunch combo / special starts from ~$6.XX, it includes a veggie sping roll, soup of the day and a main course.   Disclosure: Me and my family have been here so othen that the servers and manager know us and offer us free dessert after hour meal : )   Great service, great food and great price : ) I am going back tomorrow."}
{"text":"The restaurants decor was really nice and I especially like the metal lotus leaves that hung from the ceiling. We ordered the Soya Sauce Chow Mein, Lao Wan Style Congee, B.B.Q. Pork Rice Noodle Roll, Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll, and an additional plate of Dough Fritters to have with our congee. The Soya Sauce Chow Mein was very oily and we left almost half of it uneaten. The congee was very good with an abundance of different toppings like roast duck, lettuce, green onions, squid, peanuts, and some pig skin(which I don't particularly enjoy, but I'm sure it might suit some people's taste buds). The downside was that it became very watered down as time went on(it's best to eat it while it's hot). We ordered Dough Fritters to go with the congee and were surprised that it was made fresh(perhaps it was because we came early and they hadn't had the chance to make any yet). The Pork Rice Noodle Roll was what I enjoyed a lot and was stuffed with a lot of meat and green onions. The Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll was good as well as it was nice and chewy on the inside, crunchy in between, and covered with a thin layer of Rice Noodle."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to place but I moved and its been a while since I have returned. But I did and my experience was disappointing. Walked in (not busy) around 3:00 pm and was greeted with a miserable server. After we were seated the server disappeared and did not check up on us for about 10 minutes. Finally I got her attention and began to order and she seemed like she had something better to do... I asked her if the restaurant had udon noodles and she said no we don't, and I was surprised so I asked again and she yes we do its here at the bottom you can check it. K. Food came quickly was ok not my usual (I usually order seafood cantonese chow mein)  I didn't like it personally and the person I was with didn't like their order either there was a strange taste to it. We stopped eating,paid and left. (didn't see the server again after she gave us the food) 10-15 minutes after we left we were sitting in my car in the parking lot and bolted to the washroom, you can imagine what happend after that.  Now I do not need a hand holding server, the reason I go out to eat is not simply because of the food it is the entire experience. From the atmosphere to the customer service.   Sadly my first review has to be one of my previous favourite restaurants turned to one that I will not return to.  Update : My friend got sick a couple hours after we went to the restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Great selection, good prices and comfortable seating...BUT, the food quality was very poor...its greasy and sits in your stomach. A few hours after eating, I started to feel very sick and nauseous. Would not recommend!"}

I recommend taking time to look over the menu and pick out what type of food you want (rice, noodles, etc), before buckling down and picking your dishes.    Side note: One of my favourite things about this place is the BBQ guy. If you sit and observe, he is in a perpetual state of cleaning the BBQ area. He'll remove the BBQ meats, and give a thorough cleaning of the area before placing the meat back. This consistent level of cleanliness shows the detailed of care the restaurant takes in quality control of their establishment."}
{"text":"Congee queen hits the spot for good Asian comfort food, and is now my go-to for the Mississauga area. Great location in the Heartland plaza makes it an easy choice to dine out.  First came during the opening period when they offered 10% off to try it out, and they haven't disappointed the many more times I visited with my family. The wait times have gotten better, but it is recommended for peak times like the weekend to arrive before ~5pm to avoid a long wait and overcrowding.   Large selection of classic dishes, which have a good portion size. Prices are slightly more expensive than other places but it is worth it.  Favourites are the fried chili turnip cubes and deep fried salt/spice squid. The congee is worth a try as well, with the House Special coming in a large bowl with many different seafoods. Have tried many different dishes and love the many flavors! The tea is also great - not sure what variety it is."}
{"text":"This location is aight compared to other locations. Food looked good, taste wise nothing spectacular, they were lacking something,  couldn't tell what was wrong. The other locations were better. The restaurant was very busy, so I don't blame the servers for not coming by our desk as often."}
{"text":"Large portions, good price, and fast and efficient service.  Love the spicy fried turnips and minced beef with egg on fried rice!  Yummy!  Would def recommend for whoever that wants a cheap, authentic and fast Chinese meal!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. My dad loves congee queen and congee wong so I frequent many of their locations. The food can be a hit or a miss at times. The servers at this location were a lot more attentive than other locations even on a busy night."}
{"text":"Such delicious and fast Chinese food! We ordered:  - fried chili turnip cake -- strong garlic flavors but super tasty - pork and thousand year old egg congee -- super fast service; delicious comfort food - assorted BBQ meats (honey roasted BBQ pork, roast duck, and roast pig) -- AMAZING! The meats were so fresh, hot, toasty, tender, melt in your mouth delicious. Some of the best BBQ meats I've ever had."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend have been going here for a very long time. We always give cash for a tip, last week we went to eat for lunch and then when my boyfriend paid our bill using machine he put some 44cents tip and the rest is cash and then when I was supposed to ask my boyfriend to give me my wallet the waiter arrived to take the copy of the receipt and he then asked my boyfriend \"Why you give 44cents for tip?\" (That's the exact word) my boyfriend was shocked and then he told him \"It's not good you know\" with a disappointed and angry look , I told the waiter \"We're giving cash for the tip\"then he walked out. When we looked at him he went at the back of their restaurant and hide. We're so disappointed because we always go here and this was the first time that we were treated like this, after that incident we decided to not give anymore additional tip, my boyfriend and i are both working in a restaurant too(customer service) but this is not how we treat customers, they don't even smile. We will never come back anymore!!!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen was a pleasant surprise. The restaurant is bright, clean and modern (a big departure from the Spadina strip). Food was hot, tasty and very fresh.   I ordered the Super House Congee - it came with shrimp, crab, salmon, scallop, grouper and green onions. The bowl was huge, definitely enough for 2 or 3 people, and very inexpensive. I wasn't able to finish more than 1/3'd so I took the remaining soup home for later.   I would visit the Congee Queen again - the menu is extensive (much more than congee), the food was prepared with care and the staff were very attentive. Add the clean, comfortable and bright atmosphere and I can see why Congee Queen is so popular."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's an old favourite in a different location.  For those who don't know, Congee Queen grew into a chain for casual southern Chinese cuisine, with comfort foods such as congee, fried noodles, and fried turnip cakes.    We shared a large cauldron of congee, and it was packed with seafood goodness.  We also ordered fried turnip cakes.  There were also fried noodles somewhere in there as well.  Everything was as good as it should be, and delivered fresh.  When you're up for some late night eats, I make this my to go spot."}
{"text":"By far the best Chinese food I had! I was here with a big group of friends!  We booked before hand but for some reason when we got there we had to split into two groups because they couldn't for us, I think they should've mentioned hat on the phone, it was inconvenient for us! But the food on the other had was amazing. We ordered from everything, duck congee, tiger shrimp congee ( I prefer led that over the duck), shrimp dumpling(delicious) , chicken fried rice, spring rolls and a lot more and honestly nothing disappointed! We almost ordered 14 dishes and drinks, we ended up paying 20 (including tax and tip), amazing for all that we got!"}
{"text":"My family used to come here a lot for reunions since it's a famous congee place that's affordable. However, now we tend to go to other branches of this same franchise since our last experience with the service at this branch was quite poor. A few waiters are friendly, but most are nonchalant and come across like they're annoyed with working there or answering your questions (regardless of how busy or free they are). They're there to take your order and move on.   Food here is good to decent though. I'd say if you don't mind inconsistency with service, you can come here for the food.   Decor is clean, modern and well-lit. It can get a bit busy on weekends so expect a bit of a wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"Food selection extends beyond a simple bowl of congee. Originally a poor man's food with measured sprinkling of soya sauce, this you will not see here at Congee Queen. This place has every tasty concoction to bring a bland bowl of gruel to level nirvana.  If congee isn't your thing then there are pages of noodles, barbecue and even Dim Sum. You will be completely spoilt for choices.  Servings are huge so make sure you come hungry."}
{"text":"The reason why my family loves congee queen so much is because they have consistently good food at reasonable prices.  The staff works at a very high pace so they aren't giving you any personal attention but are always eager to help if you ask.  The restaurant itself is quite loud and the ambience is casual.  Wait times on weekends are expected.    There are some good vegetagian options here if you have a mix crowd of friends or family.  Their menu is an eclectic mix of Chinese,  thai and Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but service is poor. The food has never disappointed me everytime I come her. However the service was very poor. The servers don't speak English so it's hard to communicate. They expect you to tip a lot because the servers are not getting paid very well.   I only come here for the food and how can you tip 15 % based on pity when you didn't get service !?!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is pack, when there 10min before 6pm and that was the calm before the storm! In no time there was a huge line up! we ordered mushroom congee, eel rice and chilli oil turnip. All the food was soo good! Wanted to try more but we were only 2. Will go back with more friends next time!"}
{"text":"Very good place for groups or 1 on 1s. Gave been here twice in one week. Will definitely recommend coming here. Fast and delicious"}
{"text":"The Congee Queen franchise has been serving up Western-friendly Chinese food without selling their souls by serving sweet and sour chicken balls. But even among their various locations, this one definitely stands out for their interior design, friendly service and generous portions.  Came here for a family get together and it's a great place to share good food. The temperature of each dish was just right and I actually ordered too much food because I didn't know how big their portions would be. (This is definitely not a complaint.) The go-to dishes are fried turnip, Canto Chow Mein, Seafood Special Congee, salt and spice squid, Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce, etc. and heaps of hot sauce.  You can't go wrong with this place. Centrepoint Mall is not the most hoppin' place, but CQ is definitely a good excuse to swing by."}
{"text":"My fave Congee (royal title) chain, but also everyone else's as well - This place is always packed!   This is one of the restaurants my parents and I consistently come to straight from the airport after our travels. I just miss my Chicken and Thousand Year Old Egg congee and wonton noodles. Then there is also the Fish with Mango and the fried rice with half tomato - half cream sauce.  And let's not forget that this restaurant has the best combination of yummy food and awesome prices - I mean, no wonder you see so many large groups here.  Take Out available which is a great alternative if you can't get tables. Clean and efficient service. Sometimes it is a drag to have to get your waiter's attention for stuff...like constantly, but, you really come here for the food."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday with the family. We had a party of 8. Food was delicious, fast service and you can really tell the quality difference in comparison to your everyday Chinese food restaurant. Parking was a bit of a challenge being in the heart of a mall and busy streets. Being a busy restaurant on a Sunday it was challenging getting our waiters attention. I will be coming back with the family soon."}
{"text":"Listen, I'll keep this simple.  Food selection is great  Food was great.  I felt wonderful after eating.    Service was not as good but still good (didn't have high expectations due to how busy it was and where we were).  Place is busy.  Parking is free via a parking lot but limited.    Must try if you are hungry and Asian food is on your mind!"}
{"text":"Food and service were decent hence 2 stars.  The Congee queen steeles and 404 is always busy but definitely wayyy better than this location.  I was very disappointed with the Hong Kong style lobster which was soggy and not fresh."}
{"text":"Have been going to congee queen since it was just a single location.  Though they have expanded throughout the gta the quality of food has always been consistent and delicious.   This location in particular I go to quite often.  Though at peak lunch and dinner hours there is often a wait, the staff are very quick to clear tables and have you seated as soon as possible.   Food is delicious you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, I personally like the BBQ duck which is always crispy on the outside and moist and juicy in the inside, noodle soups are great if you don't want anything too heavy and congee is always perfect for a cold day.   Portions are large and made for sharing.  Only con I would say is that most staff are not strong in English.  But I have been seeing a slow incline with English speaking staff."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The restaurant was a fairly decently large sized inside. But I was surprised the place was so popular. It was super packed. We were lucky that we found a table because later on people even had to wait.  The food was good, price was mid-range. The servers and staff were friendly. I would go back again."}
{"text":"This is the first Congee Queen that I have visited. I loved the clean modern design complete with several drawings of women in traditional Chinese dress. I noticed a tank with fresh fish as well as a display of BBQ meats. Since I was there alone and portions are generous, I could not try a lot of menu items. I did try the hot and sour soup as well as a seafood with noodles dish. Both were quite good and were very filling. As I do not live close to this restaurant, unfortunately I will not be a regular customer; however, I do want to come back and try some of the BBQ dishes."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good for a lot of Chinese dishes. It is a good place for family gathering and it has a large parking lot. The Canton fried noodles and the congee are really good."}
{"text":"There are few good Chinese restaurants in Mississauga and thankfully Congee Queen opened one up at the Heartland Power Centre. The space is very open with an amazing ceiling feature in the middle of the dining area.  The food overall delivers and have been going a several times since it opened. The service is quick and the quality of each dish is great. Many of the dishes that would normally be greasy elsewhere is not greasy here. Let's hope the quality of their food remains as good as they are for a long time."}
{"text":"I find the food here better than most Chinese places I try. I have not ordered anything here that I did not like. Typically the fish congee, general tso, fried rice, mixed veggies, and what ever sides I feel like come ordering time. The interior makes it seem like its a higher end restaurant (probably because it's clean) but the prices are very reasonable and the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Came to this branch yesterday with a couple of new friends to share some dishes family style. We ordered the following to share: - House special congee (seafood) - Vegetable chow mein  - Vegetable fried rice  - Garlic stir fried snow pea sprouts - XO sauce turnip patties - Seafood stir fried Taiwanese vermicelli  The congee base was excellent - as someone coming from Mississauga, I haven't had such good congee in a while. However, the seafood they chose was lacklustre. Our bowl was loaded with tilapia and bass, instead of stuff like shrimp and salmon.   Since I was feeling slightly sick, I didn't sample everything there. The vermicelli, however, was really good and tasty. I also loved the snow peas, which came in a generous portion.   After splitting the bill among 9 people, the total came to slightly under $12 including taxes and tips."}
{"text":"Amazing roasted pork worth the $11.50 per lb. We had lobster congee delicious but over the top and pricey. Beef crepe funn roll was on target! Great service and it's clean modern interior. Strongly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"This place is super busy!  Make a reservation because the wait gets crazy.  I went with my great aunt and uncle and well they are sensible older Asian folk so they made reservations.  By the time we finished dinner, there was already a crowd of 30 something people waiting for tables.  So make a reservation, its so much more convenient.   The food was pretty good.  I don't think I'd ever wait in a crowd of 30 people for it.  Everything was pretty tasty but I had better versions of each dish we ordered at other places too.  I guess we should have tried to Congee since it is the Congee Queen but we didn't.  Maybe the congee would have blown our minds and perhaps thats why a crowd of people eagerly waits for seats, but we ordered seafood fried rice, lobster noodles, mixed veggies, and a beef dish.  Everything was ok and it was an ok experience overall."}
{"text":"I know my food. Forget my review. Just go and judge for yourself.   It's one of my favourite Asian cuisine spots in the GTA."}
{"text":"We arrived around 5:00pm but the whole place was packed with more than 30 people still waiting in the line.  When we seated, it was already after 1.5 hrs and we took extra time to look at tantalizing menu. We ordered lobster noodles, roast pork(1/4),roast duck(1/4) and beef with mushroom. Then, it took another 40 minutes to get our first dish, roast pork and duck.  The appearing of roast duck and pork is not fancy but after first bite, I and my husband started to fight for the rest. It is incredibly tender; fall-off-the-bone and melt-into-your-mouth tender. It is not overwhelming flavorful with a little duck fat for extra juicy and moist.  Roast pork is the best of the best and with a piece of pork in the mouth, it is a combination of crispy-golden skin and stunning juicy sweet meat. That crispy skin creates cracking sound that tell you how crunchy it is and it is so loud that others can hear it. This is the best roast pork I've ever ate.  Lobster yee mein and beef with mushroom are really nothing special; taste the same to any regular restaurant in Chinatown in PA. We didn't know that Canadian lobster is very tasty, sweet and fresh; otherwise, we will steam it for ocean-fresh flavor."}
{"text":"Another Congee Queen?! They're popping up everywhere... and I'm totally cool with that!  My aunt and uncle took me to this location for a Saturday lunch since they were raving so much about the Crispy Chicken. This location has only been open about 2 months.  I rarely go to Agincourt (the area is a little to ghetto for me), but I was just along for the ride. Parking at the plaza and getting a table was surprisingly fast, it may be because it was almost 2pm, but the place was still full.  I left most of the ordering to them: - Yeung Chow fried rice It's good, but I've had better - Salt & pepper squid Again, it's good, but since I know CQ serves squid tentacles, I'd rather have thiose - Corn & crab soup Nice, thick and flavourful - Crispy chicken It was pretty good, crunchy skin and juicy meat - Mango & Shrimp salad This was my only addition to the table... I just had to... Such a great balance of flavour and texture!  Staff was typical... a bit of smiles, but they need more experience.  They don't speak/understand english very well tho, there was a lot of pointing on the menu.  I'm a big fan of Congee Queen so this is good option if you're in the area. I really try to avoid the area so I would rather go out of my way to eat at the Markham location.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Move over Congee Wong... The Queen has arrived... And they've expanded - more than doubled their original capacity!  Dined at this Congee Queen a few times since it opened, also did a few delivery and take away orders. They serve typical Shanghai dishes just like Congee Wong. Their food is consistently good, space is nicely decorated and service is fast.   Recently, my friend and I went in for a late lunch on a Saturday and we got a seat right away. I was glad to see that they have expanded, taking over the old Lick's Burgers. We went for our usual: - Preserved egg congee I always order this anywhere it's served... Congee Queen makes them very well, no need to add seasoning. - Pork chop noodle in soup Tons of pork chop, broth is a little salty - Chili turnip The cubes are a little too big, but still very flavourful and loaded with shrimp - Squid tentacles So good! Cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Also got the Mango salad with tiger shrimp for take away. It's soo YUMM! Good balance of sweet, sour and salty flavour. And the shrimps are shelled and huge!  Since they expanded and we got in at off hours (2:00pm) we were able to enjoy our booth to chat until 6:00pm without being rushed... That's unheard of at any Asian restaurant. Parking is also easy to find, there's tons at the front and back of the plaza (another thing that's unheard of at any Asian restaurant)."}
{"text":"Wait for a table for 2 on a Friday night around 8pm was about 15 min.  Very prompt service once you order.    - Roast pork over rice.  The pork was quite lean and hence a bit tough.  Comes with a bit of lettuce which is good. - Shrimp won ton noodle soup.  Excellent noodle and the shrimp won ton was very fresh.  They're bigger than the normal won ton you'd get in hk. - Salt & pepper squid.  Very disappointing.  Too much breading and they don't season the breading.  You have to eat the hot peppers with it to get any flavors."}
{"text":"This is my go- to place for congee and fried turnip cakes! I love the fried turnip cakes, super flavourful with a hint of spicy hot peppers. Also got my favourite congee - pork with preserved egg. As well an order of fried noodles \"Ho fan\" I've been here both dine in and take out.  Today I had take out. Fairly quick and good service. Portions are sufficient. Packed in plastic boxes which is better quality than most places who pack in styrofoam boxes. These plastic boxes I admit I have reused!   Dine in, is good too. Place is fairly big, and clean. The staff here are nice too, they speak Cantonese.  Finding parking here is never an issue. Large parking lot."}
{"text":"Really love this place! Came here for lunch during my visit in Toronto. We ordered congee, duck and roasted pork, and eel fried rice. The food here is always good and have so much varieties to choose from! Prices are reasonable here. Usually don't really like fried rice but this eel fried rice is good. The duck and roast pork is very good. Staffs are pretty helpful and friendly. Their decoration is very modern and new. Wish we had a place like in my home town, wish I can bring this place back with me to Boston. This place is a definite must try!"}
{"text":"This franchise is common across GTA. This particular location I would say has good service day-to-day based except for \"holidays\" and specific celebration (mother's day, father's day etc..).  *Make sure you make reservation [esp if you have a large group] prior to going to save time from waiting with a number!!   Restaurant and food is all very HK (Cantonese) based style. Waiters are all in high speed performance and food comes out to your table in less then 5 mins after ordering. (in HK, everyone is in a rush & time is money.) *They're not rushing you, it's the style FYI*  Food taste great, generic from same chain restaurant. Price is decent for the spacious environment and service.   They have patio service at this location too! Very convenient, especially if you want to grab a beer and pair it with some turnip cakes during the late afternoon hours for some snacking."}
{"text":"Great portion size and yummy food! Quick service. I would have given 5 stars if the waiters were friendlier."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and our relatives brought us here. We don't have a restaurant dedicated to congee in Southern California so I was looking forward to checking it out. For me, this was basically comfort food (especially in this frigid weather)! We had the seafood congee, beef congee, roast duck, sizzling chicken, beef fried rice, crispy chow mein and calimari. You get a TON of congee for the price. Both the small and large portions are very generous. In terms of flavor, everything was pretty good but not good enough to rate 5 stars in my book. I would definitely return when we visit again, especially during the winter months!"}
{"text":"A-OK is the perfect description to this place.   Food is consistent - I wouldn't say it's amazing but seriously, it's your typical Chinese restaurant. I always get the fried turnip cake but hate it when they don't fry it enough because it gets soggy.   Service - sorry to say this but like any other Chinese restaurant, service suck. Servers seems to be in a rush (where are you going?) and they always look angry.  Yet I still return time after time."}
{"text":"Just came here today for the first time..dinner was amazing.  We had hot and sour soup, shrimp and chicken pad Thai, chicken satay with peanut sauce and shrimp won tons   Everything was nicely cooked and seasoned but I do believe they can improve meat quality and the menu is very confusing. Service is not great either but who cares when food is generally so fresh and good."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for a late night take out dinner and with the \"word of mouth\" about this place for their food, we had to give them a try! I had the Tiger Shrimp with Efu noodles and my wife had the Pad Thai. We both split an order of their Salt & Pepper Calamari and some Shrimp Wonton Soup! My shrimp (in a seperate soup container w.veggies and delicious broth) were cooked to perfection and plentiful in number, wholy! Noodles were in a seperate container so that you can add as much or as little as you want, also cooked perfectly! My wife's order was also bursting at the seams in regards to its proportion! There was no disappointment in her eyes when we got home and she opened up the container. Everything was packed tightly and securely! All the the food was still smok'in hot by the time we got home. They put some effort in assuring that their food would be as fresh and hot as it would have been if we had eaten there. The food was AWESOME and we definitely have found our new \"go too\" place for when we're crav'in Asian! For $40.00, it was more than worth the trip! Thanks to all you Yelpers that rave about this place, you definitely know what you're talking about. And we will be back for sure, hopefully sooner than later."}
{"text":"Big bowl of congee, professional presentation -similar to ding tai fung. Bubble tea was meh"}
{"text":"Place is nice and the food is good, however, it felt like we weren't welcomed. Wait staff didn't say a word to us, we asked for something and they put it on the opposite side of us. No facial expressions or anything. Customer service needs work."}
{"text":"We went around 1pm, so it's was full of lunch crowd. But food still came out fast. Everything we ordered met our expectation. Congee: yum. Chowmein: yum. Lobster: yum. The crowd was mostly older Chinese folks and after finishing our food, we were busy studying their orders. Everything looked delicious. We will definitely go back.  We went for our second visit. We ordered the famous spicy fried turnip, home style vermicelli, shrimp wonton noodle soup, house congee with doughnuts. Too much deliciousness on one table."}
{"text":"I ordered the Singapore Style Fried Radish Cakes. It is quite good with a little bit of spiciness. I quite like it!   Overall, i think the food is ok, nothing too spectacular. Would revisit due to the abundant choices you can get there."}
{"text":"I came here looking for quick meal after a long day.  I wanted something simple. First I ordered a rice plate with roast pork and chicken. The other dish I ordered was a noodle with beef and gui-lan.  They were both done really well and they gave generous enough portions that I had to bring some home.  It wasn't greasy at all and the noodle was done very crispy.  The roast pork wasn't too fat and the skin was nice and crispy.  I took quick glances at the other dishes that other people ordered and they all look good.  Doesn't look like you can go wrong with anything from the menu. The place is clean which is always something I look for.  The wait staff were quick to respond which was also a plus.  The tables were not too cram which a lot of these establishments are. I'll have to come back to this one when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"The worse BBQ rice ever!!!!!!!  Ordered takeout Chinese BBQ rice with Cha Siu and BBQ pork for $13 after tax (price went up from $11.5) While waiting, I noticed the chop-chef just finished a dish for customer seating in, it looked great. Half meaty and half fat.   They have plenty of half and half of display. So I'm good!  I thought to myself, \"this is why I drove all the way here for takeout bbq..!\"   Got home with my dish, and guess what I got???   Burned fat, all fat.   Wtf?   Are you giving take out customer what you don't want???????    Im a customer too, is this how you treat your loyal customer who comes for take out?  I end up throwing it out the garbage!!  Good luck, you will start noticing your customer volume decline."}
{"text":"Gross. Food court food.  I don't know what everyone is talking about, this place is not great. Hot and Sour Soup - really flavorful. Disgusting bits of rubbery pork that was probably alive last century. Slimy little vein-in shrimps that I didn't even eat. Too much stuff in the broth - tons of giant chunks of black mushroom, tons of squiggly egg bits. Too much bamboo. The tofu was good though.  General Tao's Chicken - tasted like sweet and sour chicken. The menu said spicy. Not a hint of spice. I ate an entire red chili and other than being like chewing on a wad of Saran Wrap, no spice whatsoever. Chilies tasted very very old. The fist bite was chicken skin and fat. I had one piece that had white meat in it. No pieces without fat and skin.  Beef, Ginger and Green Onion - Beef was that gelatinous kind that was probably cooked a decade ago and then frozen. Giant ugly chunks of shriveled ginger, the green onions were too chewy to break apart in my mouth.  BBQ Pork Fried Rice - NO flavor. None. The pork was NOT BBQ. At least it wasn't super oily.  My friend had: Sweet and Sour Pork - her first bite, and most of the bites after that, were gristle. Not good sauce. Batter was too dark. Too fried. Pork was basically oily jerky in breading.  Chicken Chow Mein - Noodles and sauce were good, chicken was nasty, Chinese broccoli was huge stalks, very little greens, and was practically raw. Hard to eat with noodles and chicken.   All of their meat was alive in the 90's.  Charged a dollar extra to put three slices of lemon in my Coke.  Spring rolls were good. One star for that.   This food was disgusting. At least it was cheap. I was expecting better. So disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food! I order pick up from here all the time. However, it is CRAZY busy and the pickup lines can get very long. In fact last time two customers almost got into a fight. Its busier than any restaurant I have ever been to! insanity! so if you gonna come here be patient, and dont expect a calm atmosphere. Or just do what I do and pickup your food so you only have to deal with the craziness while you stand in the line. That BBQ pork and duck is damn good, DAMN GOOD! I gotta get me some now."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend in the evening, it was quite busy. I needed to wait around 15-20 min before i got seated. Once seated my party and I ordered typical Cantonese style foods. Seafood Congee, Cantonese fried noodle, Salmon fried rice. the food took about 15 before it came so it wasn't to long of a wait.   There isnt much i can complain about the food. Everything was pretty solid, in fact; i must say their food is more on the above average side when it comes to this kind of cuisine. Food got tonnes of flavor,  tonnes of colour and tonnes of satisfaction eating. I highly recommend for anyone who is having a craving for some decent quality Cantonese style Chinese food.  One complain i do have is, it can be get quite crowded in the dining area during peak hours. With all dining guest with their large winter jackets taking up most of the room; waiters/ waitress have to walk between whatever  tiny spaces that still remain between tables. This can get uncomfortable sometimes. This does not only go for this one particular place, but many other asian restaurants in the Markham/Richmond Hill area all seem to try to exhaust whatever little space they have available to them. I understand its all for business, but sometimes i wish they take the comfort of the customers into consideration."}
{"text":"Today is the first it opened 10% discount for the first week may get extended. The food is wonderful I love getting the Cashew nut chicken with Fried rice along with BBQ Combo of Pork & Duck. They have one of the best BBQ Duck.   Service is always quick which I like & prices are very reasonable, the best is it's closer to me.   Entrance is outside next to Pickle Barrel & No Frills"}
{"text":"Simply the go to place for cantonese food. It is getting expensive though as they have been increasing their prices."}
{"text":"I think I much rather prefer this location over its mother location. I've came here a few times already, and the food is good enough to eat. Their super bowl congee is big enough for three people, and I liked the fried chilli turnip patties here. I've also had pad Thai here (lol don't ask why I got that at a Chinese restaurant), but it was surprisingly not bad! It was decent enough that I ate most of it lol. Price wise, this place is average and is comparable to other congee places like Congee Wong, Mr.Congee and Keung's Delight. I would come back here."}
{"text":"Wonderful Cantonese inspired Cuisine, probably one of the best in mississauga right now. Price is average, service is good and the food is excellent. Long lines are an indication of a good restaurant. Reservations are good for bigger groups. The Decor is awesome and lots of tables and space."}
{"text":"Super busy but amazing food! Came on a Sunday evening at 7pm and it was really really busy - not fun huddling by the door practically on top of diners at the nearby tables. But they are very nice and get the tables turned over quite fast (we waited about 20 min). The service was fast and friendly and we got our food quickly. We ordered chicken fried rice, beef with mushroom on sizzling hot plate, szechuan chicken, and chicken chow mein. We all loved it. And the chili oil on the table is really good too. Would definitely come back but might order take out instead of eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"- when there are loads of chinese folks as patrons, you've come to the right spot. - definately try their house super bowl congee (shrimp, scallop, salmon, grouper, crab, surf clam) and the fried chili turnip patties... you will not regret it. - will definately be back."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago with my brother and my boyfriend. The restaurant was quite busy when we first got there, so we had to wait a while to get served. Although there were three of us, for some reason we were only given two menus which we had to try and share. The menu was huge and can be a little overwhelming if you're an indecisive person like I am. I would  recommend checking out the online menu beforehand if you're someone who takes a while to decide. After we finally got served, the food did arrive fairly quickly and was pretty good. I really liked their spring rolls and the vegetable fried rice. When we were done eating, the restaurant had completely cleared out. Although it was obvious we were finished, no one had come with the bill over half an hour later. We watched as they brought the bill to people at other tables but clearly avoided ours. Finally, my brother had to go up to one of the servers (the restaurant was empty and there were at least 5 of them just standing around) and ask them for the bill so we could leave. I really enjoyed the food here, but it was unfortunately not the greatest service. I would probably go back for take out but I'll be weary of dining in again."}
{"text":"If I can give a ZERO star I would!!!  This has nothing to do with their service (or what not) as I soley went there for take out with a friend. But having been to their other locations previously, I would not think they would slip up this hard in their food...I am extremely disgusted and upset with what I discovered in my garlic vegetables that I ordered.  I ordered Roasted Pork Rice and Baby Snow Pea Leaves With Garlic (I believe this is the correct translation for dow miu in cantonese...). Usually, I have a keen eye for bugs in my food but tonight I was tired so I didn't notice much at the start. 3/4s way through my food I see something odd, its small and hairy-looking in the veggies. I was shocked...but all right, MAYBE it was just one and it got in my food, ok fine...but to find several more? I was ready to throw up...this isn't even about bad luck anymore! It makes me question 1) their cleanliness and 2) how they handle their produce and food in general. I am appalled and have NOT gotten THIS MANY (AND MORE) bugs in my food EVER in my entire life!!! I will show you just how many I was able to find within my REMAINING veggies...I have eaten at least 1/3 of it already and unfortunately I did not catch this soon enough...!   The main thing for everyone to take from this review is to keep an eye out for BUGS in their food! Whether this is a one time thing or not, it is completely unacceptable! I can let one slide...but not this many..."}
{"text":"Very popular and busy. Expect to wait to get seats if you come anytime past 6pm on weekends. we ordered the Singapore vermicelli, seafood fried rice, fried oysters, seafood congee, fried beans, and spicy diced fried turnips. Oysters were most delicious! Server was very kind, gave us free dessert. Will come again."}
{"text":"I been to other Congee Queen but this one is far the worst. Service was terrible and the food was bland and bad quality.  We ordered the Singapore noodle and the char-siu was old and tasted weird so we didn't eat any.  We told the server and she just stood there so I repeated myself and she gave me a dirty look.  I told them not to serve this to anymore people as it is no good.  I felt like I was talking to a brick wall.  I wasn't even asking for a discount as I already asked for the bill and paid when I told her.  I will not be coming back here for sure with so many other congee/noodle places around."}
{"text":"Quick service, tasty dishes and an overall good eating experience. I really enjoy their congee and love how big the portions are. Their seafood supreme is by far the most popular congee order but I would also recommend trying some of their vegetarian congee options such as the pumpkin one."}
{"text":"We have visited this particular location 3 times and the service is just terrible. The staff is rude and arrogant. They may not be fluent in english but they can atleast be courteous and polite and greet with a smile. The light fixture above our table was covered with dust. Although the food is decent, the attitude of the staff compells me to not recommend this location. Poorly managed. I have been to Congee Queen near Steels and Woodbine and its far better in taste and service."}
{"text":"While its founders originated from Congee Wong, it has already surpassed the original establishment in terms of food quality, cleanliness, ambiance, and restaurant capacity. The menus are basically the same, but the dishes taste marginally better and the prices are comparable. Pretty much everything on the menu aside from the beverages is a safe choice (they're not bubble tea experts after all). Their soups and noodle soups are great, and their congee dishes are excellent. Prices are reasonable and the waiters/waitresses split tips so you can get good service from pretty much any employee."}
{"text":"Their afternoon teas are the best. It happens from 3-5 PM. You get to order from a variety of dishes ranging from congee, rice, noodles (soup or stir fried), etc (for their normal price) and it comes with milk tea, lemon water, bubble tea, or red bean slush aka. ??? (my favourite). The red bean slush is normally about $5 on its own.  We ordered the bbq pork rice and the shrimp wonton noodle. The portions are large and there was a lot of shrimp in the wonton. I asked for lean bbq pork and they delivered to my liking. Yum!  Food and service is good. Great place for cheap afternoon tea meals!"}
{"text":"Very spacious interior with a clean design. Great place to go for their afternoon tea special that's available on Monday to Friday from 3-5 PM. Take out would be +$1. The combo also comes with either milk tea, coffee, lemon tea, bubble tea or fresh red bean freeze with ice cream.   The portions are quite generous and the quality is pretty good. I ordered the Fresh Garoupa & Preserved Egg Vermicelli in Soup with a hot bubble tea. There were lots of garoupa and preserved egg. The vermicelli was also cooked to the right stage; not too over or undercooked. The hot bubble tea comes in the cup that milk tea usually comes in. The tapioca is really good! It's the perfect sweetness and very chewy. Highly recommend.   Will be back as they have decent portions and the staff are pretty attentive as well. The afternoon special at this location is slightly better than the one on Steeles."}
{"text":"The waitress tends to ignore customers when someone trying to catch their attention. The most annoying part is when I am trying to pack some left over food, the waitress kept collecting dishes between my arms. They all seemed to be lazy by saving a few trips walking back and forth. For their price, service should be better."}
{"text":"Second time here.  We stopped before heading home from a meeting.  We ordered the Lobster congee - just had to try it.  Well, the lobster was succulent and perfectly poached in the congee.  The congee itself was also delicious and well seasoned to perfection.  The bowl is huge and could feed a lot of people for that 21.95,, but we ate up the lobster and about half the congee and called it done.  We also had a plate of the chilli turnip patties - yes they were as delish as the first time, and enough leftovers for at least a couple of lunches.  Finally we tried the salt and pepper squid.  Best I've had anywhere.  Cooked perfectly, moist, tender, well seasoned and not too salty or spicy as some places cook it.  This was a 5 star dish. In fact, the entire meal was great, I'd get the lobster again in a heartbeat.  A little pricey, but this was a whole, LARGE lobster, and they had it cracked and separated making it so easy to get the meat out and enjoy.  Just perfection all the way.  We were seated immediately, and the food came out quickly.  Several servers paused at the table to make sure we could handle the lobster congee  LOL after we looked at it and asked how to eat it.  It was actually quite easy to get the meat from the shells. Did I mention excellent service as well?"}
{"text":"A consistent place I can always count on.  Have all the Cantonese style staple food.  The menu is simple.  Pricing is decent.  Staffs are ok.  The food come out relatively fast.  Since this is an upgraded version of a fast food restaurant, they provide you with plain jasmine based tea, you eat, then dash."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Price is decent, portions sizes are huge and service is fast and decent as to be expected from an establishment like this (skip the chit chat just get to the order).  Every time I have eaten here i have never regretted it. Sure sometimes the food can be a tad bit salty but there has never been an occasion where I was not able to alter the dish to my preference a  bit.   My favorites are the Cantonese Chow Mein, the turnip, the dim sum ho-fun and the greenbeans fried with some shrimp. I'm told the Salmon fried rice is good but never had it so that's next.   The place can get pretty busy so its always nice to go off-peak rush hours so you can enjoy but even when its busy the food comes out pretty fast and service remains relatively the same. The waits can be long for a table if it busy but if you are patient and can weather the tiny waiting hall then you will not be disappointed.   This is the flagship location and the one I prefer although I have eaten at the Centerpoint Mall location and was equally satisfied.   BRB I need find a ride there NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! What I got on my plate looked like it was scrapped from the bottom of a barrel. We went once and I will never understand the attraction of the place."}
{"text":"Been here more times than I can count now, it's become a regular stop for my family especially on weeknights. Conveniently located just at the edge of the TTC network, it's easy access and a great post-work stop no matter how late I get off work.  The atmosphere is casual and typical of other \"congee and noodle\" locations. They have their own roaster, their own fish tank, and quite a bit of seating space. On weeknights there's never a problem getting a table, but make reservations on the weekend if you're set on coming! The menu prices are acceptable, and generally of worthy value based on taste and portion size. They are decently staffed but things get busy - as I've come more often I've gotten to know the servers and they're all very nice and genuinely trying - it's just not a kind of restaurant to be super polite and wait your turn - raise those hands and wave and get their attention! They're happy to help.   Typically for dinner we order a fried rice in lieu of steamed white rice, a steamed fish, and a simple leafy green. We'll pick another two or three more dishes depending on the number of people, from beef and mushrooms, to lemon chicken, to sweet and sour pork, to various stir fried and casseroles. Their roaster also has great BBQ pork and chicken, so those are great picks. If you are a fish fan, go for steamed fish. For chicken, lemon chicken is a tasty option. For pork, BBQ pork is the go-to. Finally for beef, their hot plate beef and mushroom is great. As to fried rice, the six grain rice is a healthy option, or I recommend their fried rice with egg whites, smoked salmon, and fish roe.  The items I do not recommend include their house special stir fry, mango chicken and tiger shrimp, and garoupa casserole. The stir fry is a mix of garlic shoots, fried tofu bits, fried taro chips, and peanuts - entirely nothing special nor worth the price. It was like eating Asian bits and bites at dinnertime. The mango chicken and tiger shrimp was overdone the last few times I've ordered it, and the deep fry job was nothing close to fresh. Finally the garoupa casserole - a favourite for my family because of the taste, but I highly dislike the tons of bones and the deep fried texture of the fish, combined with only a small proportion of tofu and bok choy.  House dessert is always a cold sago-like dessert soup, with red beans, tapioca, herbal jelly, and coconut milk. Refreshing for the warmer months of the year and always on the house, so don't miss out!  What keeps me and my family coming back all the time is the quality taste of each dish and the consistency. We've frequented many other similar restaurants in the area and found gradual but significant decline in food quality, but have so far been satisfied with this Congee Queen location. Fingers crossed they keep it up!"}
{"text":"It was Family Day and throngs of families descended upon Congee Queen. It was like a boxing day sale at best buy. Crowds of people congregated at the front, some spilling into the dining area, making us feel guilty for taking our sweet ol' time.  In other words, really bad organization there. Maybe they shouldn't have taken so many reservations or maybe people are just stupid and should've just tried another restaurant instead of waiting for a table to clear.  Our order got messed up and of course it was the vegetarian dishes so I sat there for an hour waiting for veggie curry Thai noodles which we ended up canceling because my dad couldn't stand having people staring and waiting for us to leave. They brought us the dish with chicken and shrimp originally. I got to eat one noodle dish which oddly was more Italian-like than Chinese. It had a variety of mushrooms, spinach noodles and a cheesy creamy sauce. I devoured the fried salt & pepper bean curd after they finally remembered we ordered it 45 minutes before. It lacked flavour but I was hungry!! Congee Queen made me resort to getting a hot fudge sundae from McDonald's after. It was a low point."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. I come here with family a lot - it's good for serving a big group, but is a bit pricey if you're with less than 4. The service is not good. It takes a long time to get attention, and my order had been messed up several times."}
{"text":"Non-congee dishes were excellent. However, the congee taste as if the meats were added after congee was cooked so the congee only had a plain, unappealing taste. Orders does not seem to follow the order they were ordered (even with exact same dishes)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Congee Queen, so I was excited that this one opened up near where I live. The interior is clean and modern - I'd say this is the best looking Congee Queen restaurant. Having been to this location several times, I can say with confidence that both the service and food are consistently good.  My favourite dishes that I get almost every time and would recommend others to try - salmon fried rice, pork bone congee, snow pea leaves with king oyster mushrooms, and lobster yee mein (noodles). If you ask nicely, you may also get complimentary dessert at the end which is usually chilled red bean soup with grass jelly and sago."}
{"text":"Consistently good food. Always.  Servers work fast and efficiently.  Get the empress fried rice, turnip cake, rice noodles with beef and veggies, and some snow peas and mushrooms. Lobster is pretty solid. And so is the pad thai - strangely enough.  Obviously don't forget the congee. All their congees are good so you can't make a mistake on choosing.  Clean and spacious. So grateful for this location but on weekends, be prepared for wait times. But rest assured, they have a good system and the wait is very reasonable.   Owner is a nice charitable guy too."}
{"text":"Nice decor, good service and great food. They have a nice selection of congee. Must have: cilantro beef fried dough rice noodles and orange peel fish congee. Wonton is pretty good too. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been thrilled with the atmosphere, the food and the service each time I've eaten here.   The restaurant itself is very pretty and clean. You can see into their kitchen which communicates to their customers that they have nothing to hide. The food always came quickly and no matter how busy the place was, the quality of their service and their food had never been compromised. There's only one thing I wouldn't recommend and that's their bubble tea. In all honesty, it tasted like crap BUT the manager had no issue taking the drinks back at no charge which was the redeeming factor.  In writing this review, I would kill for some congee right about now.   Go. Enjoy yourself. You won't regret your dining experience here."}
{"text":"The Congee Queen franchise is by far my favourite chow mien and fried rice stop in Toronto. I'm a regular here and each visit has always been consistent. Great food, great service.   To start, this restaurant really ups its game when it comes to congee shops decor. It's fancy, it's modern, and it's clean. This is a great place to bring the whole family, they can easily accommodate tables of 2-12, no problem.   We ordered two items. The first was the fried chilli turnip patties, this dish comes with diced chicken, shrimp, egg, and turnip patties tossed in a chilli paste. This is by far, one of their most popular dishes, it is a must try. Everyone I've introduced this to loves it. The second item was the empress fried rice, though not on its main menu, this rice comes with eel, roe and crab meat. It was very tasty, a nice blend of delicious flavours.   Other notable items I've had in the past (not pictured) but definitely worth mentioning are: beef and vegetable chow mien, and the shredded duck with preserved cabbage super bowl vermicelli in soup.   If you're ever in the mood for great Chinese food, stop in here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was actually pretty good here and the restaurant was clean as it's still relatively new. The fried turnip patties were one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Consistent quality and taste.  Portions are generous and well-priced.  If you get take-out, it's pretty fast even if you order in person.  If you're dining in, the service is iffy."}
{"text":"This place is great when you have a big appetite or are feeling very hungry. Portions are huge for everything for very fair pricing and we had a TON of leftovers after. It gets quite busy so making a reservation would be  a good idea, they have peaks hours all across the day at both regular hours and kind of random ones.service was fast and friendly. Only downfall was they brought everything at once so our table was constantly crowded and some food got cold.. But all in all lovely dinner!"}
{"text":"Congee queen is starting to become a popular lunch spot for my coworkers and I. Well on days when you can afford to doze off at your desk in the afternoon cuz that's how much you can stuff your face in this family style Chinese restaurant.   I'll be honest I've had all variations of Asian food but the closest I ever got to Chinese Chinese was either hakka or dumplings and none of those compare.  Congee queen offers a great variety of noodles entrees congee and I'm telling you those turnip cakes deserve their own category!!  So addivitviely good   Service is quick place is clean and food is delicious. Bring your friends and family for a feast!"}
{"text":"It Is My First Time At Congee Queen, I Try There One Of There Food It Was Good,There Drink It Was Good,There Service Is Good,There Popularity Is Good,There Workers Are Good And There Dessert It Was Good. ! ?"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --  I have been to this Congee Queen over 10 times, this is like a canteen for my family. I like how this branch has a very high ceiling so the sound isn't trapped under the roof (you know how people talk very loud and it gives me a migrane all the time) The design here looked more modern compared to other Congee Queen branches.   -- Food and Drink --  We ordered two dishes:  1. Sweet and Sour Pork - their pork was deep fried into perfection and the sweet and sour sauce doesn't affect the texture of the meat and make it soggy. However, I found there was way too much fat in the pork and I was hoping they would trim off the fat. I liked how they were very generous with the amount of veggies (pineapple, green pepper and onion) on the dish.   2. Empress Fried Rice - it was a fried rice comprised of eel, chopped crab sticks, fish roe and finished with some Katsuobushi shavings, green onion and seaweed on top. I liked how the fried rice was very dry and not oily at all. I found this fried rice tasted sweet since they used Unagi Sauce to make the fried rice.   -- Overall --  Congee Queen's portion sizes are huge and we couldn't finish half of the dishes. We hadto pack everything home and it still tasted very delicious the next day. I would definitely come back to Congee Queen in the near future."}
{"text":"I stopped by twice in the last two weeks - both after 8pm on a week night. The place was packed both times but the service was still good and fast. Over the two days, I tried the following dishes (I will do my best to name the dishes):  - Harfoon noodles with beef and black bean sauce. This is my fav. Chinese dish and this place had the best version Ive had the please to eat.  - Wonton soup - good, lot's of shrimp in the dumplings  - Cantonese Chow mein - also really good  - Fish with cream corn sauce - delicious  - Eggplant - very good  -  Fried octopus - not as tender as it could have been  That makes 4/5 dishes a hit. The menu is massive, like a book. It would take many visits to try everything. Restaurant atmosphere was clean, modern looking and the place was large. Prices are slightly higher than the average strip mall Chinese restaurant in Markham but worth it in my opinion. I will definitely be back (and look forward to it). No one in my group was Chinese but we had no problem with the menu or ordering."}
{"text":"Fish ball noodle soup 4 yelp Beef brisket on rice 4 yelp Fast service  Tasty and good sized portions Lots of parking Will I return .......yes"}
{"text":"My favorite spot to eat when i am in Toronto visiting relatives. Service is quick and the foods are really reasonable prices and a lot to pick. I love the soysause chicken and deep fried squid. Shopping area right next to it. This is a good spot to shop and eat instead of go to downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Ordered a Curry Beef Brisket to go. 13 dollars, no meat, just fat and tendons."}
{"text":"Personally I have been coming here for ages now and this place is the best to get a lotta Congee for an excellent price. Id also recommend the Smoked Salmon Fried Rice & General Tao's Chicken here, both tasty dishes that will have you drooling. If you want a nice refreshing drink try the Mango Slush its perfect for summertime too. Always make sure to arrive at a good time as well during weekends and fridays as the customers pile in (but the extra wait is worth it)"}
{"text":"If you couldn't tell by the horde of people waiting to get a table, I'll tell you now: This place is awesome.  For not very much money, you can get a great bowl of congee, a pot of rice and goodies, noodles, snacks, even barbecued meats - they've got it all. On my last visit my party and I ordered abalone & chicken congee, pan-fried turnip cakes, fried dough, a double presentation of bbq pork and roast pork, and a pot of chicken & mushroom rice - with the exception of the bbq pork (which was only ok), all were fantastic. My friend also said they had good coffee/tea as well.  I would only knock off half a star cuz it's so darn busy (which translates into long lines and occasionally hard-to-find servers), but the food quality does make up for it. Or just try to go at weird times."}
{"text":"This place and is really average. The wait is terribly long and the customer service is terrible. I booked my reservation for a table of 10, 3 weeks in advanced, for @ 5PM on Saturday, February 17. 2018 and had to wait 20 mins for my table. The waiting was not the problem. The problem was that they seated us at a table that does not fit 10 people! They placed two small stools there to make it 10 and we did not fit. I had two old grandparents and one person with disability. After notifying the manager about the fact. He did not change anything. While we saw an open table of 13 he did not accommodate us one bit. He kept smiling and said he could do nothing. He's the manager! They can do something but they chose not to. In the end, our family came up with a solution of pulling the table to the booth so that we can sit together to eat. It was a better option but not one that the manager came up or had a solution for. Overall, the experience was traumatic and exhausting while it did not need to be. The food is nothing to die for!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I think this is the best Congee Queen location of them all. They have a large variety of dishes, and it's hard to go wrong when ordering. For a franchise, it's surprisingly good. Their roast BBQ duck is also very yummy. Also, the decor is very nice and interesting. :)"}
{"text":"Lots of great options here for Chinese food! They have a lot of seating here and it's clean too! We ordered 2 meat dishes and 1 noodle dish... And that was too much for 2 people... We finished half of each one of the dishes and taking the rest home for lunch tomorrow. Loved the experience here and the service was super friendly!!"}
{"text":"seriously, best congee not made by my mom LOL Really tasty, lots of toppings (scallions, pork, thousand year old eggs) nom nom  Empress Fried Rice...dad loved it, I didnt try it. It had eel, salmom roe and all the other stuff you put in fried rice. the combo didnt make me wanna eat it. But he thoroughly enjoyed it.  Beef Ho Foon, awesome, great wok flavor. perfectly seasoned :)  Spicy calamari is a must!  spicy turnip YUM  we ate alot more..but my memory is failing me, but I would definately go there again.  The prices were really reasonable for the protions too :)"}
{"text":"Love this location. New, clean, modern and YUMMY. Always gotta get a bowl of congee, we like the one with the presered egg and pork. mmmm.  I didnt do the ordering, so I dont know all the names of the dishes so I'll try to describe them best I can. Mango shrimp, crispy sweet and spicy shrimp, so good. Turnip Cake, yumm, lettuce wraps, delicious, fried fish and tofu bowl, awesome.  basically, everything here is really good. You can't really go wrong. Service is not too bad and its clean.   I wish we had more places in Boston were I can just go get a good bowl of congee."}
{"text":"This review was for a year ago with update, I waited for a while to post due to the long story and the fact that I was so pissed, I emailed the owner to wait for his response. The events are so detailed because I emailed the same facts to the owner.  Food wise, just a decent Congee Queen.  If you come to this location, avoid Lily and Alice as your waitress.    EVENT 1: We sat down around 2:45PM so we ordered a few dishes from the main menu to start off.  2:50 we decided to order from the afternoon tea menu.  2:55 I asked LILY if I can order from the afternoon menu since a lot of restaurants allow ordering 5-10 minute ahead, and she said she can't take the order since there is still 5 minutes till 3PM, which I felt perfectly fine with.   3:05 I've asked LILY to take my order again, since she was the only waiter/waitress around.  So we ordered the food, and till the drinks... THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE, specifically when I was ordering the 2 milk tea with tapioca.   So I ordered the drinks in Cantonese, one no syrup and one less syrup and both less ice.  I quickly apologized and admitted my mistake and told her instead, I'll have one no syrup and one with regular sweetness.  She rolled her eyes, and RAISED HER VOCE IMPATIENTLY AND SAID \"YOU GOT ME ALL MIXED UP\".  So I told her, I will repeat my drinks again.  Before I even finish my first sentence, she said: YOU FIRST WANTED A MILK TEA, NOW YOU WANT MILK TEA WITH TAPIOCA.  NO ICE? LESS ICE? NO SWEETNER? LESS SWEET? YOU ARE SO CONFUSING.  CAN YOU SPEAK CLEARLY?  I was so mad and pissed with what she said and attitude, so I told my friend to continue the order.  Unpleasantly, she shook her head and said YOU DON'T NEED TO REPEAT I'LL JUST GIVE YOU THE SYRUP BECAUSE YOUR ORDER IS S COMPLICATED.  Excuse me?!? I apologized and you probably never work in your life, I know people who order more complicated, that's the advantage of a HK restaurant.  After all, my friend wanted to make sure if there are no charges with the milk tea with tapioca and Red Bean Ice.  She replied rudely THE MENU SAYS IT ALL.  IF THERE ARE CHARGES IT WILL BE SAID. and walked away.    Honestly,  I would have reported this incident on the spot to the manager; however, because there were few unclose friends I did not want to make this too complicated.   I admitted I made a mistake and apologized, how can you ever talk to a customer raising your voice in such rude attitude and roll your eyes.  First off, I never even said I wanted milk tea.  Second, my friend just wanted to make sure if there are additional charges on certain drinks.  Thirdly, her canto is WAY OFF FROM LIKE MAINLAND CHINA.  If I am confusing, she is ridiculous because I have been living in Hong Kong for more than one and a half decade. I was so mad that I emailed Congee Queen.  So Congee Queen, you better train your employees well and tell them to speak in the language they can speak and understand fluently.  If she cannot understand or speak good Cantonese, train your employees to get someone else that does to take an order and TELL HER NOT TO MAKE A FUSS AND SAY I AM CONFUSING IN A RUDE MANNER AND ATTITUDE.    EVENT 2: Few months later, I decided to pay another visit.  I made a reservation at 6:30.  I arrived a minute or two before my reservation; there was no reception and I had to stand for few minutes.  Your reception then came, called ALICE.  We made a reservation for 10 people ONE WEEK BEFORE, and she lead us to at 8 people table right next to the exit knowing that we have 2 kids.  She then said it is just like that, I'll just bring you circle tools, and she walked away.  ARE YOU KIDDING? It was squishy, small and uncomfortable.  We made a reservation, and there was no table ready for us.  She said we do not have tables for 10 people.  And I had a quick glance and there was but there were customers in the table.  WHAT IS THIS?  After walking away, she never came back.  I asked her then so would you want us to stand and eat.  She said just wait, it is just like that.  By the time she said it was already 6:40.  So I made a reservation at 6:30, no table ready, forced to sit in such squishy table near the exit.  RIDICULOUS. I WOULD NEVER COME BACK AND TELL ALL MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY NOT TO.     ALL EMPLOYEES IN THIS LOCATION has such horrible, rude attitude and manner.  First LILY, next ALICE."}
{"text":"I know there are 43987542401391 congee places around Toronto (yes, that many. Just take my word for it). So while this place is good, it's not amazing. It's clean, it's got ample parking, it's got decent congee, but it's also got mediocre other foods (including the xo pan fried radish cakes) and pushy servers.  I've been here on several occassions now and I haven't yet had an amazing experience. So it'll just stay at 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"When I think congee, I always picture some hole in the wall restaurant with sticky tables. So when I first stepped into Congee Queen, it's like seeing the sun! Four years later, and I still return to this place when I'm back in Toronto. The food is good though the portions are smaller than some other congee places, and the place is bright and clean.  It has a patio area for some strange reason (I never thought Chinese people were big on patios, but meh) and it's definitely your upscale congee house. The best dish hands down is the fried turnip patties. They come out individual cubes and hold their shape when you pick them up, not like some places where the squish into a pile of goop from being too soft. The congee is well seasoned and the noodles are never too greasy.  The price is on the high end for congee joints, but it's still really reasonable for Chinese food. I make this a regular haunt when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is great. I give it a 3.5. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the restaurant, but when you have been to China and tasted the food there, it is very hard to replicate.  The decor is quite modern. The staff are friendly and the prices are fair ($10/person will get you a good meal). It is best to go with a person who knows the food the first time. They will help you get to know the real good dishes that you may not have the guys to try.  Overall, this is a great place with great food. My table ordered seafood congee, anchovy fried rice, and other dishes that I can't remember.  I would go back and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for my HK congee and noodle fix. The decor is great at this location in particular and I like their hk-style milk teas.  I like the shrimp ball congee here, but they make the type that's not \"home-made\" feel, it's really thick and starchy, but I actually don't mind it that way.  Solid fast-food style cantonese food, good option for lunch =)"}
{"text":"Food is great!  Service could be more attentive and friendly.  Everything I've tried here has been good,  so enjoy!"}
{"text":"We came here for a work lunch. I got the noodles with chicken and shrimp. I thought it was pretty bland. I needed to add more hot sauce for it to be more tasty. Looks like they have lots of options here so I don't want to completely rule it out, so we will see.   I'm also not a huge fan of congee so that narrows down my choices here."}
{"text":"Why they decided to open a Congee Queen here that is a stones throw away from the one at Steeles and Don Mills is beyond me. If they really felt like it could be a contender, I've got some news - it's not. The place is crowded beyond belief, and our party of 13 was just three small round tables pulled together side by side. It was like we were \"dap toi\" (sharing a table with separate bills), extremely uncomfortable and tight and so noisy that we couldn't hear the conversation two persons over.   The food was passable, but not up to the quality of other Congee Queens I've eaten at (4 in total now). I don't even feel like recommending any of the dishes. If you're absolutely desperate for a congee fix, this is doable - but I'd suggest you drive the extra 10  minutes to go to the next closest one."}
{"text":"I had this place recommended to me by a local and I think it was a solid Chinese restaurant that does a good job of providing both authentic and North-Americanized food.  Surprisingly, I found the congee to be a bit bland, but shrimp dumping soup was on point. Also much to my wife's shame we ordered General Tsao's Chicken and it was a very good rendition because of the quality of ingredients.  We also tried the Tiger Shrimp/Chicken with Mango, which was a bit sweet.  Overall solid Chinese food for all types of eaters.  I would not hesitate to return to this place in the future."}
{"text":"Loved all the dishes I had. Started with the pumpkin congee and youtiao (deep fried bread) . The bread was so doughy, chewy, and very addictive. I wanted to order another plate, but my husband ordered other entrees so had to contain myself. Their house chili sauce and deep fried bread make a good combo.  The entrees we ordered came out all at once. We ordered  the fried bean curd, deep fried sea bass, and the salt and pepper squid. These were also very delicious. Especially the sea bass, it was crispy on the outside, but the sea bass was perfectly moist and not oily on the inside. Definitely getting this again."}
{"text":"With a 'People love us on Yelp' sticker on the front door, this is a complete let down! Guess you can just get a sticker without people actually loving the restaurant.  Parking isn't too bad here, but thats the only thing I'd say was good. The restaurant is so busy, you can barely sit comfortably, let alone get to your table. There were constantly people (not servers) walking around that it you'd have people bumping into chairs!   The food was way over-salted. Everything seemed to have so much salt in it, that everything kinda had the same taste. I honestly can't even remember what we ordered!   Service was pretty quick overall, but didn't really make up for the amount of salt in my food. Unless you have a craving for salt and crowds, I would not recommend this location. Try another location! Not like there aren't a ton of them around."}
{"text":"Went here at 10 at night. This place replaces the other two Congee wong in terms of food, taste, and decor.  Interior: A LOT nicer than Congee Wong. Somewhat Classy for a chinese place HAH  Food: Ordered a whole bunch. Yeung Chow Fried Rice was legit. Veggies (Ong choi/dow miu) are great. Desert (dun dan) is tastey.   Service: Fast and snappy.  Overall: Great."}
{"text":"Location: This is busy lols.  Anyhow no matter where you are coming from it's going to be a traffic jam and parking may be difficult to find.  Did you know that this is in the same plaza as Go For Tea (bubble tea place)?  So you know what I'm going to say next, prepare for some horrible asian parking lols.  Anyhow it's located on Highway 7 so just be forewarned.  Otherwise, the place is quite nice lols.  Service: Since Congee Queen is a franchise/chain now, you can expect some decent customer service.  Their menus are English-friendly and most of the staff are 50% proficient in the language.  I suggest that you go first with an Asian friend then slowly branch out to coming in different ethnic groups lols.  It's actually quite loud at this location and I think that is due to its layout.  I don't see any sound barriers at all but it's gigantic.  It's also the best looking Congee Queen in the area, but if you ask me, there is a Congee Queen every 20 minutes that you drive within GTA.  Food: For Chinese food, Congee Queen has pretty good standards.  Their BBQ meat are top-notch and portions for dishes are adequate.  But to be fair, most asian restaurants don't go cheap with amounts however this is quality and quantity.  Never come into this restaurant not ordering BBQ duck lols, or any of the other meats for that matter.  They have a wide variety of congee selections but I will say they are on the expensive side - however, still good lols.  I really have nothing bad to say about this place but let me name their more popular dishes (cause I go there like monthly): - Stirfry radish turnip cakes - Roast duck - Rice noodle wrapped fritter - Seafood congee  My rating: 3.8/5 Others would rate it as 4/5"}
{"text":"The wait at the door took 15 minutes but I guess the service made up for it. I was quite impressed at how quickly the orders came to our table. So far, this location is better overall compared to Congee Time which is nearby and the food had more flavour. As for the interior, they have an odd mixture of decor and I guess they attempted to aim for a fancier restaurant compared to other congee places. All in all, much cleaner than other congee locations with a tad loud but still casual atmosphere. I guess if I have to go back to a congee restaurant, it'll be this one for now."}
{"text":"Spoke to Lara to make a reservation for a large group of people. Still had to wait about 20 minutes, but it was extremely busy on a Saturday around dinner time. Food came out quick and hot! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Superb meal, from appetizer to main. The 'healthy' assorted fungus and six-grains congee (A4) was so delicious we scraped the bowl clean then put the next visit here on the calendar and invited friends. Would also totally order these again: (K34) fried bean curd and vegetable and (P3) the shrimp & chive noodle roll. All the sauces were flavourful and balanced, not overly sweet like at some places, and you can taste that the deep fry oil they use must be good quality and changed often to keep the tofu light and delicious. I imagine that it helps that they have such a high turnover here - every time we've been here the place is packed, and well it should be."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday and boy was it busy! Even during dinner they were turning in high volume. Surely there must be a reason for its popularity as I just saw it as a typical chain restaurant.   We were seated in a table for 4 and ordered 3 dishes: Fried pork, Cantonese fried rice, and rice noodles with chunks of sirloin. I'll admit with the night being very busy, I'd expect our food to come late. 10-15 mins later, we were enjoying our food. It arrived in large plates/portions and tasted phenomenal. The fried rice stood out for me: it was sprinkled with shrimp when typically most places would be stingy to provide that much shrimp on a plate of rice.Only downside though I expected it was slightly oily and salty for my taste; but passable.   The staff was courteous although not a lot of energy was put into their interactions with customers. I didn't really mind since the food and speed of the service was superb. The prices were a tad expensive even for the portion size, but I guess when you're paying for quality it makes sense. Overall a very satisfying experience and happy I don't have to go to Scarborough for Congee Queen. This will be one of my go-to places for Chinese food."}
{"text":"If this place had a song it would be 'Baby, hit me one more time by Britney'. It's timeless  If any of you are craving greasy but yummy chinese food, this is the place to be.  I been here a multiple of times. I always get the bbq duck, empress fried rice and milk pudding. The bbq duck is juicy and greasy but a good type of greasy where you want more The empress fried rice is always bomb cause they add bits of eel in there  Milk pudding is amazing cause I can't find anything like this in Toronto and it's so milky and not too sweet  4 stars because it satisfy my chinese food craving and the service is always quick and ready."}
{"text":"Got the large Pork Bone, Dried Stockfish, Peanut Congee. Ahh, it was sooo good. In general, I like Congee queen/wong's congee very much. I wish they opened one downtown as it's hard for me to find good congee downtown. I'm giving this congee 9/10. In general, I give the food at this place 8/10.  Other food on the menu are typically really good also. Prices are also reasonable (but sometimes depends on what). A while back, they started serving huge HK style lobsters. Those were really flavorful too. It's a good place to try the lobsters without breaking the bank.  Quality: 8/10. Service: 7/10. Value: 7.5/10. Overall: 8/10 (Not an average)."}
{"text":"This spicy deep fried tofu has no taste at all. Do not recommend, not worth for the 10 dollar price tag!"}
{"text":"We happened on Congee Queen while staying in Markham and found it on yelp. I must say after eating Chinese all over the world including china this place was the most authentic and the most delicious.  We ordered calamari, the BBQ duck, Cantonese chow mein and the shim shumai soup.  All of it was spectacular and the service was great. While most Asian restaurants were empty in the area this one was packed.  There was a reason. The server Denise was fantastic also and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food seems consistent each time.  Came for lunch around 3PM Thursday and ordered some combo meals with a drink.  Really enjoyed the cold lemon tea, while my gf wasn't a fan of the HK milk tea.  Wasn't that busy around that time, half the restaurant was closed off (empty) while our half only 3 tables including us.  Food came out quite fast and big portions for a decent price tag.  Would come here again."}
{"text":"It's our go-to for chinese food. I can't think of a dish here that is not good. Our staples are eel fried rice, roast duck, roast pork, turnip, sizzling beef, hong kong style lobster, i could go on and on. They just do a good job with everything! It is however always noisy and crazy busy....servers rushing here and there, hungry people waiting to be seated. So just ignore those and focus on the succulent duck you are eating :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  The price for the amount of portions they give you is REALLY worth it, the only downside is that a lot of their menu items are a little heavy on the MSG.  Good place to eat at once in awhile"}
{"text":"The worst food I've ever had! Ordered a congee that smelled foul, a chow mein that the gravy was like mop water, and a general tao with soggy, chewy, rubber sole consistency, and I asked for veggie fried rice with it for the extra charge to have a yellow rice with nothing in it!!! Bringing the total bill to just under $50.00. That's crazy!! I will never go to another congee Queen ever again in my life! What's the point of complaining to these people about it they don't care about food quality at all... Stay away if you value what you put in your body!"}
{"text":"My family and I come to this location quite frequent.  It is spacious with high ceilings meaning that it is not as loud as other locations.  Congee Queen is a Cantonese style restaurant chain with some Thai-Vietnamese fusion dishes.  Service is really quick here even when it is a full house.  It is usually packed on weekends during lunch and dinner, so I recommend making a reservation if you don't want to wait.    Here are some of the dishes that I recommend:  Empress Fried Rice- has eel, fish roe, imitation crab meat, seaweed, egg, red peppers.  This is like a Japanese style fried rice in my opinion and is usually not found in normal mom and pop shop Cantonese restaurants.  You know the fried rice is wok-fried well when there are no rice clumps in your dish.  Crispy Tiger Shrimp & Mango Salad Tossed with Custard Sauce - this shrimp is lightly battered and fried and coated with a creamy mayonnaise custard sauce on top of a mango Thai salad.    All the BBQ Items - This places does BBQ really well, especially the BBQ Pork and BBQ Duck.  The meat is very tender and juicy. Spice Pepper Salt Squid - lightly battered and fried where it is crispy outside and not chewy inside  Fried Chili Turnip Patties - My grandma really likes this as the turnip patties are crisp outside and soft inside  Golden Milk Pudding - milk pudding with some brown sugar dust on top, great dessert to end the meal with  This place is fairly consistent in offering great food, good portions at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Love the classic wonton noodles. But my wife said it was too salty. HK BBQ duck & roast pork are so so. Prices & services are good."}
{"text":"Great place! Came here for supper. It was really busy but the food did not take long to come out. It was really good! I would recommend this place and go there again!"}
{"text":"We frequent the Congee Queen at Steeles and Don Mills which is quite close to us as is but was really excited to see a new one opened even closer.  This one is very fancy smancy compared to the other locations.  I love the big chandelier in the dining room.  It's got modern decor and very spacious.  I see previous yelpers commented on poor service.  Maybe we lucked out as we didn't have any issues with the service here.  Quick and friendly.  Came for lunch on a Sunday afternoon with the family and didn't have to wait for a table like you would at the other location.  We've also gotten take out from here on a few occasions as well.  Good quality and prices are exactly the same as the other congee queens as far as I can tell.  Overall great decor, food quality and price.  Definitely my new go to Congee Queen."}
{"text":"They lost my reservation for ten people. Anxiety and anger ensued. It was a surprise birthday party that became just a birthday meal because of the loss-of-reservation fiasco. I had called twice to confirm and they still stated at the door that they didn't have it on record. Luckily, early guest arrivals immediately got a table number and one  opened up relatively quickly.  The food is as expected. Very decent Chinese - we ordered lots of seafood based dishes like seafood congee, fish fillet with corn, crab claw, seafood rice... All delicious, and not too much to complain about. As they've only been opened for a week or so, congratulatory flower arrangements abounded in the restaurant, some of which contained beautiful lilies that carry strong scents. As someone with pollen sensitivities, my nose kept twitching and gradually became stuffed up.  The place was very busy when we went on a holiday Monday. They didn't have enough chairs as they were so busy. Two of the guests at our table had to sit on stools.  It's a great location for them in a multicultural setting like Agincourt Mall. It's right next to the Walmart and hard to miss. Lots of free parking.  At the end of the day, I would have given the place three stars, however, just a few hours after dinner, I am left with a somewhat upset stomach and there is no way to justify anything higher than two stars. Perhaps it's due to their grand opening pains, but I'm just really not feeling the love for this restaurant.  Currently, there's a grand opening special of 10% off. Credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"So I went here with my friends last night and it was my first congee place here in toronto *ugh*. My friends told me that this is the best place to go to if you're congee-craving but the customer service is bad... Really bad. Of course, I don't want to judge the people working in there so I said to myself, I'm just gonna observe.   We had shredded pork with preserved egg and salted egg congee, baby pak choi, and squid calamari. The food were great and we all enjoyed it. Two thumbs up!  However, the customer service was quite bad in my opinion. The guy who took our order was kind of rushing us, and was correcting our orders. Then we asked for small plates for our side dishes since we only have small bowls on our table and glasses of water, the guy looked dismayed. I would've understand if they were busy, but when we came in there were only few people eating. We're not asking for too much, those requests were normal.   All in all, the price was affordable and the food were great! I will definitely come back despite of the bad service :)"}
{"text":"3.5-4  Congee Queen, you are pretty good.   My friends and I came here hungarrryyyyyyy. We ordered 3 congees and a vegetable (Chinese broccoli? I can't remember) and we had enough leftovers for 2 days worth of breakfast. I think we overdid it a little. :P The portions are pretty big.  This place was perfect for my friend recovering from a stomach bug. Perfect comfort food for someone who isn't feeling well.  We tried the 1) tofu + mushroom, 2) tofu + corn, 3) rock crab, pumpkin, and fake sharkfin.  The tofu was very very fresh and silky. Tofu and mushroom had more of a savory taste, tofu and corn was sweeter, and the pumpkin, rock crab, and fake sharkfin was a mix of both. I personally enjoyed the tofu and corn the best, though I couldn't stop eating others too! Overall, the dishes had really good flavor and consistency.  The vegetable that we got (and devoured easily) was very fresh.   The only thing that bothered me was that the service was really short with us and sometimes a little bit confused. We didn't speak Cantonese so I think that was part of the reason."}
{"text":"Huge portions and quick service. Clean restaurant and some delicious food.  I tried a few dishes, but it was the fried chilli turnip cakes that stole the show. YES!!!"}
{"text":"A decent experience taking slow service into consideration lool We came in a group of 10 with reservation at 7pm but regardless we arrived 5 min earlier, we were still kept waiting for 15 minutes before being seated. Ordered 12 dishes in total :D  Love their sweet sour chicken, I know it sounds like a white peoples dish but as someone grew up in China, we do have such dish in canto region and Congee queen makes it real legit I.e. Not the one you usually get at food court, much better  Tried their seaweed and crab meat salad, refreshing  as we have had many meat dishes, will order again :)  Other thumbup: turnip patties- man you have to get this one, it's my must order here.. even my friend who doesn't like turnip loves it, it tastes better with their hot sauce ;) also, salt pepper pork chop is very yummy too heehee  Average: disappointed at BBQ duck! So slim that it's  basically skin attached bones!! No meat! Where's my juicy meaty BBQ duck!?!? Also the two fried rice were average.. we ordered one salmon and one eel, tasted pretty much the same loool and the chicken congee is disappointing too, it's the \"special\" one with many fancy ingredients.. I'd recommend going for the traditional/ basic congee which is more original and flavourful in my opinion (basically the cheaper one at the bottom of the menu)  10 people, 20 bucks each including tax and tips, not bad at all! Will def. come back again and again lol"}
{"text":"An alright go-to restaurant for Chinese food that you know will be decent. There is a wide range of dishes, from congees, dim sum, bbq options, and the regular Chinese fare are quite good across the range. However, in recent years, the prices have gone up, as portions have gone down, thus, losing the value that was there. This location has increasingly gotten very busy, especially dinner time any day of the week, so a reservation is highly recommended for any dinner meal. I also have found that the dishes have come extremely oily; especially the noodle dishes and vegetables. Would come again on the basis of practically guaranteed good Chinese food with a large variety to choose from, but pretty turned off by the ever increasing prices and decreasing portion sizes."}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars, decent Chinese food exactly as you will expect in a typical Chinese restaurant. I went there for lunch with a big group so ordered over dozen dishes. They were pretty much the regular Chinese restaurant food, taste like what suppose to be. However, even with so many dishes on the menu, I hardly can find anything that is interesting, creative or make me excited to eat. So it is why it is a solid 3 star. If you are just looking very typical general Chinese restaurant food. It is where you can go."}
{"text":"OMG!  Why have I not gone to eat here sooner?? What a gem!  Maybe cuz it's a bit far from Brampton lol but well worth the drive.  I've been told the Thornhill location is the best out of their other locations.  Went with my sisters and her friends for dinner tonight, I think I enjoyed everything I ate!  I wish I could tell you everything I had to eat but I didn't order the food and had a friend take charge to order our meal.  So definitely family style and everyone shares, which I liked.  So I will try my best to recall what we ate.  I believe we ordered most of our items from the 'Exciting Hot Picks' menu.  I'm going to try to recall our dishes the best I can by reviewing the menu and matching what we ate cuz you need to try it!  We got congee with seafood (possibly the House Super Bowl) and another congee bowl with salted egg? I think lol...Lobster HK style, House Seafood & Mixed Vegetable Fried Taiwanese Vermicelli, Empress Fried Rice, Fried Chili Turnip Patties, Snow Pea Leaves with King Mushroom and Congee Queen Special Chop Suey.  All of the dishes had great flavour, it was fresh and hot when our plates came out.  Oh and the food came out FAST!  I don't think I've ever had Chinese food like this.  My least favourite was the vermicelli noodles, it was good but not as good as the rest of the dishes.  The downside to this place especially on a weekend is that it gets really busy and packed!  We made reservations and still had to wait for a table.  The table we got would have been good for a group of 6 but we had 7 ppl so I felt we didn't have much room especially when the food started to come out.  Tetris skills were put to use today lol.  I thought the wait was worth it cuz the food was great.  Service was good, I wouldn't call it outstanding as they are so busy but, enough servers walking around if you ever needed anything.    For a group of 7, after we split the bill...we split it by 6 ppl as the bday girl didn't have to pay...only $25 per person!!! Come on...what a steal for the amount of food we got and we were full!   Had to give it 4 stars due to the wait with a reservation and the small table we had to cram in but overall, a good place to go to for a Chinese chain restaurant.  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is soo busy and the service is quick and excellent quality food. Coogee soup is very good. Pad thai is remarkable.   Do it get your coogee on."}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times. Service is better than Congee Wong for sure, servings are larger and prices are slightly higher. I like the ambience here, its updated with modern furnishings and ive never had to wait for seating which is a plus. Lots of waiters that serve on you, accommodating and actually thank you at the end. I find some asian restaurants forget to say thank you and just ignore you after you pay the bill. Dont try the mango pudding tho that sucks!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty big. We came in with a party of 20 around 4 PM without prior reservation and still managed to grab 3 large tables. However towards the 5 PM, the place started filling up and you could see a line forming at the door.  They have two menus: a regular menu with very little pictures, and then a \"hot picks\" menu which is full of pictures.  This place has fresh BBQ meat hanging in front of the kitchen. We ordered the two-meat combo, and we had the choice of any two pork, chicken, or duck. The portion sized seemed a bit small, but flavor-wise it was alright.  They offer super sized bowls of congee, and it also tasted pretty good with all of the ingredients they add to it. Their house special super bowl comes with a bunch of random seafood options.  We ordered some vegetable dishes and tofu dishes off the featured menu. No problems there. Also got the Salmon fried rice off the featured menu. It tasted great, and wasn't too greasy either.  Tea was free.  My biggest issue here is... no complimentary desserts.  I was hoping there was free dessert, like most Cantonese restaurants when there's like a group of 8 or more.  Or at least fortune cookies for the more Canadian offerings, but they didn't have those either. I think there should be at least one complimentary dessert.  But overall it's a good place to go with groups."}
{"text":"You should try this Chinese restaurant. The food served here is one of the best in its category. The service is OK. Be prepared for a long wait at lunch/dinner time though."}
{"text":"Food is great for it's value - great for those craving some good Chinese food and those families or individuals who want to dine for a moderate price.   The roast duck is great! Their pork congee is also very good - almost as good as my mom's! The stir fried daikon cakes are to die for - a must order when dining here. You'll surely have food left over for tomorrow! And it tastes better when the food soaks in all the flavors over night!"}
{"text":"Party of 8 on a Saturday for 11:00am lunch.  Two tea dispensers on the table.  The place was 25% full, 50% full by 11:10am and 75% at 11:20am and packed 20 minutes later.  Quick service and great food all around! A much better visit this time around."}
{"text":"One of my staples for take-out.  A few of the dishes are always good like the fried turnip patties, rice noodle roll and the congee.    However, other dishes often result in a strange aftertaste (soups, lo mein, deep fried chicken/pork dishes). My wife, on the other hand, usually enjoys most of the dishes we order."}
{"text":"Have to give them a thumb up... Ordered a congee yesterday due to hang over and it was surprisingly better than a lot of places that we've tried so far in the area.. Fast service too. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We ordered yeung chow fried rice, cantonese chow mein, sczheuan beef  and fried squid...we always frequent  this restaurant and noticed that they have raised the price but you get less out of food. The quality also changed.  The yeung chow fried rice which had the yellow colour before, now looks greasy and white. The beef has more red peppers than beef.  The staff are still rude as usual."}
{"text":"So I usually visit Congee Queen at least 2 times a month. It's an easy place to pick up some good Chinese food without feeling sketched out. It's pretty clean at Congee Queen.  Here's the run-down of what I usually order: Super Bowl Congee: My fave congee! I'm a huge fan of congee and seafood, so putting the two together was pretty much a given. There's a pretty generous serving of giant shrimps, salmon, scallops, squid, and some other fish in each bowl. It's well worth the low price that you pay for it. Spicy Salty Squid: I really like this, but it can be quite greasy at times. The amount of salt and spice is perfect!  Sweet and Sour Chicken: One of my faves. Sometimes they go quite heavy on the red sauce, which makes me kinda sick, but most of the time, it's just right. Chinese Broccoli with oyster sauce: The broccoli is always crunchy! Yum! Spicy Salty Tofu Cubes: I like these as well, but I'd love them even more if they were slightly smaller cubes that turned out a bit crunchier.  If you ever order take-out from this place, the portions are slightly larger for the same price, which is definitely a plus."}
{"text":"This place is really packed during the weekend! So make sure you come early! The menu has a variety of dishes. The congee is really good. They have good wonton noodle soup... the noodles were very soft and fresh. The mei fun dish was good too. Portions are huge! Price is reasonable. Must try place!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Crazy busy. We only waited for 10 minutes at 7:15pm on a Saturday night. It was harder to find parking. Super efficient staff. Food came to us in 10 minutes. Delicious. Cooked right. Pleasant waitress Jenny was very personable. A must go!"}
{"text":"My parents took my husband and I to Congee Queen recently.  They had been there before and said the food was great.  They were right, the food was excellent.    We ordered Sliced Beef Congee ($4.75), Chinese Dough Fritter ($1.70), Shrimp and Chive Rice Noodle Rolls ($4.25), Cantonese Chow Mein ($10.25), Fried Tiger Shrimp and Chicken with Mango ($13.50), Fried Chili Turnip Patties ($5.95), and a bowl of steamed rice ($1.50).  Which by the way, was way too much food for 4 people.  We ended up with a box of leftovers.  I'm not a fan of congee, but the Sliced Beef Congee was not bad.  It had ample slices of tender beef and it wasn't too salty.  I didn't eat any of the dough fritter because I don't want to waste my calories on fried dough (must be an acquired taste), but my parents enjoyed dipping it into the congee.    The Shrimp and Chive Rice Noodle Rolls were quite good.  You get 3 rolls which look like white rolled up blankets with shrimp stuffed inside.  They had decent sized shrimp in them and the rolls weren't overly oily/greasy.  I love Rice Noodle Rolls but my husband refused to eat any because the texture is gooey.  If you don't like tapioca pudding, rice pudding, or bubble tea, you will likely not like Rice Noodle Rolls.    The Cantonese Chow Mein was acceptable, but nothing outstanding.  Not a ton of meat, but not too stingy either.  The noodles were not as crispy as I would have liked, but the sauce was good (not gelatinous like at some restaurants).    Fried Tiger Shrimp and Chicken with Mango was too sweet for my liking.  The shrimp and chicken are battered and then deep fried (sort of like General Tao Chicken).  I did enjoy the fresh mango pieces in the sauce though.  The Fried Turnip Patties were so tasty.  Pan fried pieces of turnip and flour mixture, mixed with egg, shrimp, chicken and pickled veggies.  This dish has a spicy kick to it, so be forewarned.  You can even see the flakes of chili if you look closely.  Really flavourful and a nice combination of spicy, savoury and tangy (from the pickled veggies).  Loved it!  If you are in Thornhill, you should definitely give this Congee Queen a try.  There are other locations (which I have not been to), but the Thornhill one is their \"flagship store,\" so I would imagine that it's the nicest.    Service was good.  They forgot our steamed rice, but quickly brought it when we reminded them.  They refilled our waters without us having to ask.  And they came over to check many times about our food allergies/intolerance.  They were being very careful, which I appreciated.       Decor is very modern and clean looking.  Washrooms are very clean.  The restaurant is in a strip mall so there is lots of parking.  We left very full and happy :)"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is in a little strip mall on the southwest corner of Lawrence and the West Donway.  It's a cheap, cheerful and plentiful chinese restaurant in the same vein as Congee Star and Asian King, offering a plentiful menu with congee, noodle dishes, barbecue, etc.  The menu has some really nice photos of the food -- beware that serving sizes are large, larger than the photos, so don't order more than you need because you expect the serving sizes to be smaller than they are.  We had lunch there today, with: - Clam, Mustard Green and Salted Egg congee: this was decent without really standing out for me.  It was well-prepared, but wasn't my favorite combination of congee ingredeitns. - 1/2 BBQ Duck: Good, without being peking-duck-like (BBQ duck isn't, usually, but I always hope it will be anyway). - Crispy Cantonese Chow Mein: I always love crispy noodle dishes, and this one was a solid contender. - A tofu dish on chinese greens whose name escapes me. It was good without being stellar.  Basically, that was the theme -- I enjoyed each dish, nothing bad and nothing really superb.  I'd go again, but since Congee Star is pretty similar and closer to this office, I'm more likely to go there. I might slightly prefer Congee Queen to Congee Star, but they're close enough that the variance doesn't matter to me."}
{"text":"I come here all the time with my parents. The eel fried rice, vanilla shrimp and the turnip patties are the highlights in my opinions. Other wise their black pepper beef and general tao chicken also taste great. This is great if you're really into Chinese cuisine, and don't mind sharing dishes. Great for family dinners and reunions. Quite busy but they won't make you wait too long."}
{"text":"Man oh man oh man!! This is a foodies heaven! Super large portions, fair prices, good services! I mean what more could u ask for! Spend my 23rd bday there with mommy... Gosh those r the best duck i ever had in my life and fried cod are so juciy n tender inside crispy to perfection on the outside. The only problem was not enough source. And ALSO! Y'all need to try their Wonton K! It's a different level!  I do hav small hands but their wonton, two wontons are the size of my fist!!! WTF! N it tastes heavenly... for any shrimp lovers like me.. This is a gift from god! The wrap is so thin you can see the shrimp fillings inside. And inside is big chunks of shrimp so fresh so tender.  Anyways they got me addicited!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty cheap but portions are large. The congees are very cheap yet delicious and the wait isn't very long. The place is pretty popular and the interior is very new and comfortable. Service is great too!"}
{"text":"I decided to give Congee Queen a try, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.  Congee Wong is still one of my favorites.  The congee was too thick, and the crab congee - there wasn't much crab in it compared to Congee Wong.  This restaurant was more expensive than Congee Wong.  Food quality is still at Congee Wong."}
{"text":"I love this place and it's 100% my go to Chinese place when I need some good value good tasting food. Their portions are so big for relatively small prices. They have so many times of congee but my favourite is still pork and preserved egg. They also have this amazing soft shell crab fried rice that's slightly spicy but oh-so-good. There is something for everyone on the menu! Everything comes really quick and I've never had a bad experience here (trust me, I've been to most of their locations)!"}
{"text":"Want hot, good Chinese food? Come to Congee Queen.  This is a popular spot and I can see why it is. It's the typical loud Chinese restaurant but you can tell they put effort into making it more modernize and clean. Food was served hot and fresh. We ordered the following dishes:  Salt and pepper squid - Lightly battered and deep fried, delicious Empress Fried Rice - Had bonito flakes, delicious BBQ duck - Roasted duck is great, delicious  Fried bean curd with veggies - It seemed more like tofu to me, delicious Fried eggplant, minced and salted fish with spicy sauce - I'm allergic to eggplant, ate it anyways, not my favourite dish but I'll eat it I guess Fried rice noodle with beef and scrambled egg sauce - This was my favourite dish there, would 10/10 recommend eating again, delicious"}
{"text":"This place is usually packed on the weekends with many families ordering delicious food! We got the flat rice noodles stir fried with beef, fried rice, wonton noodle soup, turnip fried patties, and their crab soup. All dishes were yummy and came in generous portions to feed a family."}
{"text":"The radish patties were amazing here. We ordered the radish patties. efu noodles, and beef with rice noodles  This restaurant is your traditional Chinese restaurant with a lot of options. The place is clean and service is quick. Some of the dishes like the rice noodles were a bit bland but the portions were good."}
{"text":"Every time we have a family get together, we bring everyone here because they can accommodate many for one table. There's usually about 15 of us at once. We get seated pretty quickly considering it's always packed in there. The customer service is ok, you may have a really nice server, or you can end up with a REALLY awful one. My family doesn't mind though because the food is reasonably priced, in big portions, and it arrives fast. We order the fried spicy calimary, seafood congee, chicken fried rice and peking duck. Taste is definitely a 10/10."}
{"text":"I went during the first week when they opened up for dinner. It was packed to the brim and had to wait for half an hour. I'm not sure if the waiting time has slowed down since then. The food itself was amazing! They had a huge selection to choose from- everything from congee, rice, noodles, domain, desserts etc. When I went, I had the schezuan chicken,wonton soup, shrimp rice rolls, and black glutinous rice with coconut milk (shared for two). Perfectly filled us both up! Food and service was very prompt and fast! Enjoyed the atmosphere and aesthetics of the restaurant! Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Good food but SO BUSY. This place has been open for a few months now and there's no signs of the crowds letting up. Arrive early or else you will be stuck in the sea of people waiting at the front entrance. We had a reservation at 7 and still ended up waiting a good 20-30 mins to be seated.   The service is fast once you order and the food is consistent, a bit pricey though.   Would I go back? Maybe. It might be worth it just to order take out and avoid the chaos and the crowds."}
{"text":"Congee Queen serves up unique congee creations in addition to other Chinese dishes. The fried dough in rice noodle wrapping is pretty impressive.   But the winner is that it's one of the few places in the Toronto burbs that has a nice and clean venue and also accepts credit cards."}

Canton Chow Mein, Soft Shell crab fried rice, Beef Ho Fun (black bean wet rice noodles), spicy calamari, a side of steamed garlic veg, and spicy fried taro, had us stuffed at \"siew yeah\" (Late night dinner/snack).  The only complaint was there was hardly any crabs in the fried rice which is a bit of a rip, and the taro was obviously nuked then quickly pan fried (it was a bit soggy when it should have been super crispy).  Open late, yummy food.  Cantonese comfort food.  If there were more congee places downtown, this is where you'd go after a night of clubbing instead of Rol San or Swatow.  http://app.toronto.ca/food2/DineSafeMain?userRequest=view_history&ESTABLISHMENT_ID=9415495"}
{"text":"This place is fancy, clean, and delicious! Tons parking out front and as soon as you come in, you already know that your bill reflect the decor. We ordered the Gai Lun with Hoisin sauce, Mango Chicken and Shrimo, and crab and fishmaw soup.  Everg single dish was cooked to perfection! The gai lun was soft yet crunchy!  Mango chicken and shrimp was sour yet sweet! and the fishmaw soup had more crab than fish!  Im telling you this meal was so damn delicious I wanted to make it my last meal!   The service was decent and prices were pretty expensive due to the place being in RICHmond Hill but thats the way she rolls sometimes.  Come here if you are looking to splurge on super good chinese food!"}
{"text":"I got the mixed vegetable fried rice ($8.95) for take out tonight. It was a healthier (and cheaper) option from their menu. It was quite a surprise to find the mushrooms in it. It was simple but delicious - couldn't quite finish it myself, so it's going to last another meal at least.  Despite being crowded and busy, getting take out was very fast and efficient. The food was ordered and ready in ten minutes."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here, service not so much. Prices also went up (but still very reasonable).  Even during a non-busy time, the service was lacking. It was hard to find someone to flag down.  On our most recent visit, we ordered: Congee (dried fishstock & pork bone & peanut) - ordered the small size and most of the bowl was pork bone, so not as much congee as we would've liked Chili turnip patties - turnip cubes were mushy this time around. Tip: add chili oil Spice and pepper pork chop - delicious, esp w white rice Dough fritter rice noodle roll - I think these were overdone as they were very crispy. Also didn't come with enough soy sauce. Snow pea leaf w king mushroom - This was the best dish on the table. Done pretty much perfectly."}
{"text":"Central location in scarborough for meet- ups and get-togethers.  Came here for lunch today with an old colleague and her boyfriend at around 1pm Sunday. The wait to be seated was approximately 15 mins.  As soon as we were seated we ordered right away and the food came out 5mins later. I got the trusty wonton ho fan, my colleague and her bf got the fried beef ho fan & sizzling beef with mushroom, then we ordered a spicy calamari to share.  Food is always good. Service is fast and the price is fair.  This is really the go-to place, because there's definitely something on the menu that will please everyone."}
{"text":"I just want to express my thoughts and experience with party that I organized for over 200 people. It has been positive and smooth execution of the whole thing. I live in NYC area, but was called to organize 50th anniversary for my in laws, on Aug 14/2016, first time I called to initiate the food order I talked to a nice gentleman name Henry and from then on Henry has been graciously accommodate all my needs for food, I got more than enough food for all of my guests and Henry took a good care and made me feel secure to deal with , regards to the catering and all, Congee Queen was only the source of food I had for my party and I got a lot of positive compliments. If Henry is reading this review, I want to say thank you for all the honest suggestions and for taking a good care of my catering needs. If I get a chance, next time I'm in Toronto area, I will stop by and eat at your restaurant again."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Congee Wong but this is even better! Seems like they've upped their game. There's now a wine list (limited, though). l am also very intrigued with their new lobster hong kong style and maggie style. I didnt get a chance to try it but saw a number of tables order it. If it's comparable to Fishman Club House I'll never have to go back to Fishman's! Menu is very extensive. Food comes out super fast (got it within 5-10 mins of ordering). Everything was good except Pad Thai so I'd recommend sticking to Chinese dishes, since it's their specialty. There's also a private room available for parties. 3 tables with max capacity of 50 ppl. Min spend is $328 per table."}
{"text":"I've always ordered the most basic chinese food such as cantonese chow mein, and menus like these can't go wrong. I don't think I've had any trouble with food in any chinese restaurant. As long as you don't mind the server not giving shit about you this is nice place"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here and If I am in this area again I will come back. The food was really great."}
{"text":"We've been dining at Congee Queen since they opened, and prefer this location.    The food is okay, but can be hit or miss.  Service is efficient.    On this visit, we ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein.  I have to say I'm a bit tired of this dish, but a relative requested it. The seafood was a bit rubbery, especially the shrimp.  The snow pea leaves with garlic was quite good, tender and not too salty or greasy.  The stuffed peppers, eggplant and bean curd were tasty.  The Chef Special fried rice was very disappointing.  The rice was hard, like al dente, and had to be washed down with lots of tea.    Prices have gone up quite a bit."}
{"text":"Always come here during the late night for some congee. The lobster here is very good and the price is decent. But the portion of the meat dishes are always very small. The portion of congee is huge and very quick. Good place for some comfortable food."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch. The place was busy but the service was surpisingly quick and attentive.  We ordered chicken congee, gai lun with oyster sauce, shrimp crepe, and dough fritter to go with the congee.  All of the food literally came out 5 minutes after we finished ordering.  The waiter was really nice to us and the food tasted really really good. It was hot, fresh, and oh so yummy!   The price was typical of a chinese restaurant. Cheap and delicious.  The inside of the restaurant is nice and the bbq pork, chicken, and duck make you even more hungry!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best Chinese food I've ever had. Amazing soups best crispy noodles, fish and dumplings. As well, super nice ambience. So fancy. The stuff is really nice as well. I love the idea how you get big portions in order to share with all your table. Always enjoying to go there."}
{"text":"Every time I come here there is such a huge line that sometimes it's difficult to even get in!  I would recommend grabbing take-out during peak times so you aren't stuck waiting forever for a table.   The line is there for a reason though - it's good food at decent prices.  The place is also clean and comfortable to sit in and would be above average for a \"fast food\"-type Chinese restaurant.  There is a large menu with a large variety of different dishes - good for two or good for a giant table to share family style.  On my last visit, I did take out, and the following cost approximately $35 total including taxes:  - preserved egg and pork congee  - half a roasted duck  - black bean and beef rice noodles  - yeung chow fried rice Takeout wait for the above was approximately 15 minutes.  This place is solid."}
{"text":"Congee was mediocre at best, the fish inside was so rubbery that I could not eat it.  Chicken tasted weird, I'd go as far as saying it was the worst chicken I've ever had.  Left all the food and went to eat at home.  The waitress was nice enough to ask me what's wrong with the plate when she saw that the entire plate was unmoved.  They cancelled that order from my bill :)"}
{"text":"Congee Queen recently opened in the Heartland area couple months ago and the busy-ness replicates the one on hwy 7! Came in on a sunday for lunch and there was a line out the door (similar to the one on the hwy 7). Lots of tables though, and the turn around is quick so you shouldn't be waiting for more than 15 minutes even if there is a line out the door.  Menus are the same as the one in Markham. Portion sizes are generous and the quality is good. Very clean as well and modern looking. I love how they had marble tables as well! Service is speedy and we were seated and finished eating within 40 minutes.  Lots to choose from, from noodles, rice, sizzling hot plates, noodle soups, congee, and other small snacks. They also have drinks from milk tea, bubble tea and alcohol to choose from as well. Bonus is that they have a BBQ section (similar to all the other congee queen locations) where you can get roasted duck, bbq pork, etc.  Will definitely be returning when I have my congee craving!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now and the very first time I came here, it was very disappointing. A lot of people were waiting at the front door because it was a Saturday night and it was extremely busy. We had a reservation for that night and the hostess at the front took forever to attend to us. We had to force ourselves in the front to get them to talk to us. And even then, a lot of customers were complaining about how they were given different information about reservations. They were questioning why they were told they couldn't reserve when others were able to reserve seats. Knowing that there were other angry customers made it really awkward for us who were able to reserve seats fine.   Even with reservations, we waited for about 20 minutes. Finally, we got seated. The rest of the service were good from then. Food came fast (and we ordered a bunch of food) and we were able to get out there within an hour.   The second experience I had was today...and a lot better. Service was fast and better organized. We were immediately seated and our orders were taken right away. We ordered the shredded pork congee with salted and golden egg...this congee is really delicious and comforting. They have so many other choices on the menu but this one sounded really good..and it was! Super delicious and filling. Can be shared between two people. Good portions and reasonably priced.  We also got the deep fried shrimp wontons..it came with 8 shrimp wontons..and for $6.50, it was really worth it.  Service was 10x better this time. I highly suggest to go on days and hours where it is less busy...because you get a good and quick service. The food is always good so there are no complaints there. Prices are reasonable and portions are great and shareable. Nice and clean place. Servers and hosts are okay...some need to be friendly, but if you're looking for quick service, this place is great...just avoid the busy hours."}
{"text":"I KNOW congee queen is good but I CANNOT forgive the service of congee queen. In one night they spilled hot soup on me, forgot my order, and screwed up my order!! Bathrooms are also very dirty!  Food: 2/5 Sevice: 1/5 Ambience: 4/5 Price: 3/5  Food: Congee queen has too big of a menu!! Theres some very great dishes, congee, rice are all great! But there are some terrible dishes you have to watch out for.   Also the portion sizes looks big but they add a lot of extra filling to buff it up.  My rice soup dishes were extremely bland, they forgot my wontons, and brought me the wrong vegetables... the  dish was awful.  My mother had a 2 meats rice dish and instead of adding more duck they filled it up with more bbq pork. It was 5pm and they were already out of duck!! Why?  Service: RARELY anybody speaks english and MOST speak only chinese.   they punched in the wrong order and i had to wait over 10 minutes to get 2 wontons from them.  Then when i asked them to help me package my soup because it was a bit heavy, they proceeded to spill hot soup all over my pants. Everyone could hear it but the server was probably a little off as he just continued. He then applogized and proceeded to just give me a lot of paper napkins to clean up  I went to the bathroom after to clean up only yo see a mother changing a diaper in the sink.  Ambience: its really great! Renovations look nice, and the place looks very great.   I wouldnt come back, to congee queen, i know their food is great and i will only get take out. The service as just so bad and its obvious theyre only there to look for cheap labour."}
{"text":"I just had the blandest lunch at a Chinese restaurant ever. I've been to Congee Queen before and I loved their food, but today was a totally different story. The food sucked! Congee Queen totally bombed today!  Spicy Chili Pepper Fried Tofu. This was the WORSE chili pepper fried tofu I've ever had! This includes the time that I tried to make it at home too! The tofu was not crispy. It was not salty. It was not spicy. We had to ask for the salt!  Spicy Fried Raddish Patties. It was not spicy. It was nicely fried, but it was so bland.   House Pad Thai. It was so bland. The worst pad thai I've ever had!   As you can see, one word summarizes it all: BLAND. And this is not me being sick, my family was with me and they said the food was awful too.  So if you're looking for very bland Chinese food. Feel free to visit Congee Queen."}
{"text":"It was a simple meal.  We ordered a bowl of Sliced Fish & Blood Jello Congee, Snow Pea Leaves with Garlic Sauce, and a bowl of customized fish soup noodle (this was completely similar to the ones that Deer Garden offers where for $9.75, you can customize your soup base, noodles, toppings, and add on a snack too).  K chose the Tomato & Pumpkin Fish Soup base with udon, king oyster mushrooms, tofu puffs, with a side of pan fried beef tongue.  Everything was decent and filling.  The snow pea leaves were especially fresh and soft.  The bowl of udon was very large too and came with steaming hot soup.  The Tomato & Pumpkin Fish Soup base was so clear and appetizing.  We really enjoyed the pan fried beef tongue too.  It was so tender and well seasoned."}
{"text":"First time eating here, and it was a great overall experience for both my eyes and taste buds. As a group of three for dinner, we ordered WAY too much and ended up bringing a little less than half of what we ordered back home, enough to cover our breakfast and lunch the next day.  We ordered most dishes off of their popular dishes pamphlet which was provided with the full menu book. We ordered two regular sized congee (the oyster and the pumpkin/lobster), a chow mein, a vegetable dish, fried fish pieces, and Shumai. Wayyy too much for us three, we should have ordered only one congee, but we didn't regret it since the congee was amazing. The chow mein was good but typical, the vegetables and shumai were okay too, the fried fish served with the egg soup sauce was freshly fried and glorious. So out of the 6 dishes we ordered, both congees (especially the pumpkin) and the fish were the standouts.  Food came quickly (congee arrived within minutes), and service was quick and courteous. Place is very clean and was nicely decorated. We came in on a Sunday around 5:45 pm and it was fairly empty; by the time we left the place was full and there were 4 groups waiting at the door. I would suggest coming in early for dinner if you wanted to come here without placing reservations.  Overall, considering the HUGE portions for their dishes, it is certainly worth the value! Great comfort food to end my vacation in Toronto. Hope to come again!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the service...not so much. We had to hunt for a waitress to assist us throughout our time at Congee Queen. When they put down the dishes they don't state what it is. For one item we weren't sure if we received the wrong dish. We notice the waitress coming by to peak at it."}
{"text":"I've been here so many damn times that I can't even count. Amongst other Chinese restaurants, gotta say this one has got to be in my top 3.   It's a pretty strong franchise with a ton of locations around the GTA, and every new restaurant seems to look even better than the last. This location is off the highway and although it isn't the closest Congee Queen to where I live, my family and I love the service here and parking (the restaurant is right next to a little mall) definitely is not as big of a hassle in comparison to their other locations.  Food here is definitely above average, the quality and the portions alone already beat most of their competition. I think my favourite dishes that I seem to order every time are their BBQ duck and pork as well as their \"gan chao niu he\" or also known as the beef chow fun - very delicious and comes in a huge plate! Prices are reasonable; portions are big and the taste is delectable so you won't be regretting your visit after coming here.  Service is really good here. Waiters/waitresses are polite and attentive and they don't take their sweet ass time aka half an hour to get you an extra fork.   Restaurant looks great aesthetically, is definitely a lot cleaner with a certain sophisticated look that many asian cuisines do not have. But unfortunately for most, it is very loud in there (but which Chinese restaurant isn't?).   Keep in mind before coming here that this place is extremely crowded on Friday nights and weekends. It will be very hard to get a seat within 30 minutes if you arrive between 12-1pm and 6-8pm. Easiest thing to do is just call in a couple hours before for a reservation and you can simply skip the long line-up (with exceptions to holidays where it is probably recommended that you reserve a table at least a few days in advance)!   Overall I have a great experience every time I come here and I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who is looking for an enjoyable Chinese dining experience!"}
{"text":"It's comfort food all the way.  The decor is modern and the place seems to cater more to those who also speak english. i.e. CBCs and Westerners who can't read chinese. I think it's great because we can go to a place and order the same foods my parents eat without feeling like I have to show up with my whole family.   The food is the staple chinese dishes like congee, some dimsum, and noodles in soup or stir fried. Not sure where else to go in north york for these things (other than big chinese restaurants) so this is the perfect place.   Service, just wave any one down, there is no one server for each table."}
{"text":"My comfort food.   It's not the best quality but it's sure is tasty. Lots of choices from Congee, to main dishes, noodles, snacks almost anything Cantonese (they have pho and pad thai too!) that you can think of.   I like coming here for congee or noodles. It's quick and fast - and large enough portions that two and dine for under $10 with leftovers to take home for lunch tomorrow.   I also like getting take out - I call ahead and order my favourite congee. Comes in a nice heavy duty plastic tied up all secure (I don' tknow how they do this) so it doesn't spill in the car.   Park here, and after your meal you can waddle off the food in the Shops at Don Mills."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience dining here. The sizzling beef with mushrooms was fantastic. I would order it again. Fried rice serving was huge but the rice could do with a bit more seasoning.  The tea provided was hot and refreshing.  The salt and pepper calamari was tasty but a wee bit too salty.  Spring rolls were just ok..nothing special. I suspect they are from frozen.    Service was decent don't expect to be waited on you have to flag servers to place your order.  The restaurant is spacious and stylishly done.  We would return."}
{"text":"They've experienced a massive improvement since they opened. Prices are still high but now actually worth it. They've changed my impression and I'd strongly consider this place when I want Chinese food and don't want to venture to the east end.  We ordered a healthy \"grains and veggies\" congee. It was loaded with ingredients and didn't taste like MSG. Sizzling pan beef and mushroom was very good and large portion. Steamed fish was cooked right! Sambal beef fried noodles was very delicious and tasted similar to Malaysian style.   This is not another \"Congee\" place. It's a well decorated Chinese restaurant that serves many standard dishes, and some unique dishes, at decent quality. The place gets packed fast."}
{"text":"Fast service and great on a cold night. Stop by for some good congee and fried turnip. Stay away from their fried rice dishes...it's nothing special."}
{"text":"I have been a frequent customer at the Markham location and I am so excited that they opened a new location closer to home. I am always impressed with the quality of their food as well as their service. When my friends (who do not speak chinese) order their food, the waiters take to time to make sure they get it right. The restaurant is huge and it's beautiful. The ceiling decor is by far the most extravagant compared to any chinese restaurant that I've been to.  The only thing that makes me hesitate to come dine here is how BUSY it is. I often don't have the time to be waiting an hour for a table, and I'm surprised that this is the case even on a weekday, however, this just speaks volumes about the quality and taste that I can only begin to describe."}
{"text":"If there's anything lacking of this restaurant, they make it up in variety, speed and quality of the food. This is the perfect establishment for anyone that loves  Cantonese fare, the best style of Chinese food in my opinion. The menu has hundreds of options and this might be overwhelming, so I recommend glancing at pictures instead to make your selection. I always recommend a stir fry, noodle, rice, and definitely some of the fresh bbq. If you love congee this is certainly a must, with dozens of options. We typically get. Preserved egg and pork, a safe choice but always great! Congee queen always deserved a visit when we travel to Toronto. Prices are also very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Classic Cantonese food. Must try the Cantonese Chow Mein. This place is busy 24/7. Also a note, don't order any drink that needs to be made (Ovaltine, Horlicks,  smoothie, etc) unless you feel like receiving it AFTER you get the bill."}
{"text":"Lived up to their reputation for delicious food, with large portions and served quickly.   Prices seemed reasonable as well.   We had the house super bowl congee (seafood) that was indeed a super large bowl of congee.  Excellent.    Half duck, mushrooms & greens, cheese seafood sticks and lemon chicken.      Really, really full...and happy.    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night and it wasn't busy at all compared to a weekend night. Quick and efficient service is what you expect at a Chinese restaurant. We ordered preserved egg minced pork congee, rice noodle roll with beef and dough fritter, fried eggplant/tofu/green peppers stuffed with fish and wonton soup. All tasted decent but the stuffed veggies was a bit bland. For the four small dishes it came out to about $30 so prices are pretty average. Lots of tables and decor was nice..prolly one of the nicer Congee Queen locations. Make sure you come here early on weekends for dinner because usually there's a lineup."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on hwy7/mccowan. Decided to come visit this place since its relatively close to work. I think the food quality is just as good as the hwy 7 location, but service was so so. Maybe I went on a busy night, but it took a while for my food to come. Servers were also quite slow.. Wasn't very impressed. Overall a decent stay.. I would go back."}
{"text":"One of our favorite lunch place in Toronto!! I've been to Congee Queen for a couple of times at different locations and none of them has disappointed me! Definitely worth five stars!!  My favorite dishes:   - Chili Turnip Patties  - the clam congee - eel stir fried rice () - the milk-pudding-like dessert ()   Service is always good too, though most of the times we do need to wait for a couple minutes. But once you sit and order, the dishes will be served fast. And last but not least, this place is super CHEAP! Can't ask for more for that price. Will def continue  coming back!"}
{"text":"Mhmmm, at Congee Queen today!  I actually do come here pretty often because they have a wide variety of food and it's a good place for big crowds for dinner or just lunch for two. Very versatile place where you can have snacks and bubble tea as well. It's also convenient because this location is next to a Walmart and a No Frills!  The sitting area is pretty big but it's always busy at dinner time, people/families would be left waiting for seats near the entrance.  I came here for a late lunch and ordered about two dishes. I've been here other times with my family and we ordered a lot, but I'll post those foods on another post whenever I do come here.  So I ordered a main dish and a snack. My snack dish is called Zha Leung or (I believe) Dough Fritter wrapped with Rice Noodle Roll! It's a mouthful to say, hahah. You might know the dough fritter (the golden brown part) as it is usually paired up to eat with congee/porridge. Whereas the rice noodle roll wrapped around it is sometimes seen in dim sum, where it wraps shrimp or beef around. But together, they make Zha Leung!  In the little sauce holder is soya sauce where you'd pour it all over the zha leung to add taste to it. The dipping sauces are peanut butter and hoi xin (oyster) sauce respectively. I like mixing up and switching sauces per piece of zha leung.  Their presentation here was messy with the sauces spilling everywhere, it was hard to even drizzle the soya sauce all over the zha leung because the cup was stained with the sauces.  For my main dish, I had curry beef brisket with rice!  The curry here is actually pretty decent - hence why I order it from time to time. Feeling beef brisket that day, although it was hard to eat because beef brisket is super chewy and might get everywhere. They have potatoes in the curry as well! The spice level of the curry does build up over time if you do drink the curry or eat it with your rice.. so be wary of that. Was actually pretty strong for me after awhile, hahah.  Depending on the time you go, it might get really busy. I went around a down time period of like 4PM-ish, so both food and being seated was quick. The waiter notified (while ordering) in advance that the curry beef was going to take a bit longer - so that was nice.  I do enjoy this place, and it's quite convenient as mentioned earlier because it does have ample parking space as well. It does get pretty busy at dinner time, so watch out for that! They also do take out and they have a variety of other cuisines like Pho and Pad Thai if you're not feeling Chinese food.  This place is recently my to-go place for Chinese food, haha - maybe it'll become yours too!"}
{"text":"This location is definitely one of the nicer Congee Queen locations. It's massive with a large seating area and modern decor. We came on a Monday evening so it wasn't busy as usual. We ordered sweet and sour chicken/shrimp, gai laan with oyster, and crab & fish maw soup, all of which were made to perfection. The portions were generous. The prices were a bit higher but you get what you pay for when the restaurant is nicer. Great tasting food, lots of food choices, and decent service. Will come back if im ever in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Come for the food, not the service.  Their menu is huge and my family always enjoys their meals at Congee Queen. Our favorite dishes are their Congee, Fried Chili Turnip Patties and Spice & Pepper Salt Squid. They have a large variety of congees. It's smooth, warm and incredibly comforting. Plenty of topping options. The Turnip Patties are slightly crisp on the outside but smooth and fluffy within. Highly recommended. The Spice & Pepper Salt had a lovely consistency. Crispy on the outside with the perfect chew inside. Not difficult to bite into at all. It's tossed with chili flakes, salt, garlic, pepper and green onions.   The restaurant is modern and clean.  One big thing we'd like to see change is their service. Once seated, you will have to wait awhile for your server to greet you. If you need extra napkins, sauces, water, the check, etc you most likely will have to look for your server. When you finally spot your server, they most probably wont look towards your direction and power walk past you. This has been our experience with this chain for years. Yet, we keep coming back for their tasty dishes.  This location is open till Midnight Mon-Thursday and Sunday. It's open till 1 am Fri-Sat."}
{"text":"Ordered a roast duck on rice combo and there's literally only rice in the box with little oily duck skin and bones. I would rather have a McDonald instead."}
{"text":"This is the newest, and prettiest location. I've been to the Don Mills/Steeles and Shops at Don Mills locations several times and only once at this location. I know Congee Queen is very popular, but for me the food is decent and vast in choices. The thing that has me returning are the Turnip Patties!!! They are soooo good, and a lot of work goes into making them. They are definitely worth repeat visits!! Everything else I could walk away from really, but those turnip patties.. oh boy!"}
{"text":"I love all Congee Queen's.  Such huge portions.  I love the Empress fried rice, deep fried salt and pepper squid, chilli turnip cake, bean curd hot pot and any sizzling pans (I have a sick addiction to anything that sizzles).  So why only 3 stars? I find this place way too crowded and the tables can be dirty sometimes and service isn't the best.  Sometimes takes 10 minutes for a dish to come come out (which isn't a lot but considered slow for Chinese resto).  Overall great for food, but definitely not a date place"}
{"text":"I go to a lot of Congee Queens in the east end of the GTA.  Their food is consistently good.    My personal favourites:  -Salt and pepper squid -Supreme Eel Fried rice -Fried chilli turnip cakes.  Their congee is also very good.  This is like the restaurant that never fails!"}
{"text":"In a pinch for Chinese food. I'd tolerate here because I'm a guest and not the host. That's the only way I'd visit here because their food (Sorry, I'll keep my negative thoughts to myself. Obviously this place is very busy, and others with lower expectations and less refined taste buds find this place to be a neighbourhood gem. So, the restaurant is doing something right.)  Mind you not all their dishes are subpar, they do have some dishes that are decent."}
{"text":"Spectacular location. Finally a decent Chinese restaurant in the west end of the GTA. Consistent food quality and speedy service (looks the the key crew who made the Don Mills and Lawrence a success are at this location)."}
{"text":"I've been to different Congee Queen's in Scarborough and while I do think the Sheppard/Kennedy location is slightly better in quality, having this location in the west end more than makes up for it.   My Congee Queen favourite, the spicy turnip cakes were crispy on the edges, but not as spicy as I expected. Not enough green onions and egg like in Scarbs.   The fried pork chop in sweet and sour sauce was good (but the best is at Maple Yip Seafood Restaurant in Scarborough) but this would suffice if that's what you're looking for.   The snow pea leaves in garlic sauce is the best choy dish ever. It's $14.95 but sooo worth it! Try it if you've never had it before.  The yeung chow fried rice is good, but I think House of Gourmet in Chinatown in downtown Toronto has the best so far.  Come here between 3-5pm and if you get something on their afternoon tea menu, you can get a drink for free. Go milk tea! The decor is super nice so all in all, worth the visit of you're in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Huge restaurant with long lineups, but the food is worth the wait!   The deep fried turnip patties are incredibly tasty-crispy with just the right amount of salty, spicy, and sweet. The Stir-fried seafood with Chinese broccoli was surprisingly good-- large pieces of juicy shrimp, scallop and squid. The fried rice noodle with egg and shrimp was mouthwatering thanks to the generous portion of eggy sauce. The sweet and sour fish was on point, too--multiple fillets of crispy, deep-fried fish served with the classic sauce.   Yum."}
{"text":"Blessing for the cold and hungry!!! My first impression was wrong...and I'm not too proud to admit it. I've shun Congee Queen for so long because somewhere in my foggy memory, I remembered that their price was steep. It was only when I came back recently that I realized how wrong I remembered the experience.   This was a lovely blessing to my pneumonia stricken self. All I wanted was a nice bowl of congee to soothe the feeling of death that plagued my body, late night and stormy, in the middle of Scarborough. We came in from the cold to stuff ourselves with glorious Chinese food. We of course over ordered in our state of weakness; ordering a mushroom congee, fried salted pork, and a vegetable fried rice.  The price was average but the portions more than justified the price tag. The congee was amazing. Silky smooth, warm, and the blend of rice and gluttonous rice gave its texture nice and thick feel. The mushrooms was an added bonus. The fried pork came out and I was a little worried as it looked under battered. However, first bite dictated the contrary. Its crispy exterior and tender juicy interior left me a happy sick mess. The rice dish was massive and delicious, we piled on the condiments (especially their satay).   Overall, service was average, food was great!!! Well worth the trip out that stormy night. This place was worth the praises. Will certainly be back often, hopefully in a healthy state this time around."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food is always delicious & such awesome value! Even with long line-ups on Sunday evening, hostess was efficient and courteous. Wait staff are attentive, efficient and courteous. We didn't mind a 25min wait for a table of 4. Clean, modern Canton resto that serves hot delicious fresh Canton dishes. I'm always really impressed by how they manage to operate so effectively. Many restaurants with this level of volume would totally mess up. From the hostess to the last wait staff who served us, they didn't even break a sweat. It's places like Congee Queen that make me miss living in the East end"}
{"text":"This place has been consistently serving good food, both qualitatively as well as quantitatively! And now, innovatively with 5-grains fried rice! We come here time and again, and we're always impressed with their service, food, and decor."}
{"text":"I REALLY enjoy eating here. The place is nicely renovated & very clean, unlike some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area. It's also in a pretty convenient spot near Hwy 7 & Leslie, so a lot of busses can take you here if you don't drive.  Apart from this, the food is soo delicious, whether you come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Honestly, I think all of their dishes are amazing. But out of everything, I find myself craving their fried turnips the most. (But maybe that's because I just really like fried turnips in general...) I think this restaurant is the best for coming with a bigger group of people, like around 4 & then sharing the food asian-family style!"}
{"text":"Great food portions for a decent price. Service is actually pretty friendly and fast. The dried oyster and lean pork congee is really good. I also ordered the Cantonese chow mein and the fried squid. All super good and definitely a must try."}
{"text":"My first time trying congee, and I'm a fan! There are several sauces already on the table to flavor the congee with, and when we asked for some spicy sauce it was brought quickly. The portions are large and meant for family-style dining, order a huge bowl of congee (more of a vat, really), a couple other mains and a side or two, and you can easily feed a family of four, for under $50.  The service was quite good, and the food tasty. I'll be going ack on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Fried squid is awesome. Roast pork is unreal. Singapore noodles are good. Green beans w/ pork and dried fish are da bomb, fish hot pot was magical with light and fluffy tofu like in China and some of the best steamed fish you'll ever eat, green mango salad was sweet, juicy and delicious! I would definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Food quality seems to be really slipping here.  We came tonight and ordered 3 simple dishes.  We got the garlic snow pea tips, sweet & sour pork and the minced pork with eggplants.  The dishes weren't great but they do not warrant the expensive price tag.  You can get better tasting food at a food court.  I think that I'll give this place a miss for dinner items.  If I returned, it would be for the noodles, rice rolls and congee.  Our dinner came to $52, with tax and tips.  You could get a much better meal elsewhere for that amount."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write as Congee definitely has their fans, per other Yelp reviews. Based on the reviews I was excited to dine here the past week.  The food looked amazing and my dinner was excellent. However I had some issues.   I started with the hot and sour soup. It was a cold evening (I live in TX so it's all relative) and I was looking for something to warm me up after my chilly walk from my hotel. I specifically asked for a small bowl of soup. Keep in mind I'm dining solo. Well small here equals a bowl large enough for 4+ people. I asked if this was the smallest they served, yes. Really what a waste of food. Before my soup arrived I asked the waitress to help me order. I explained what I was partial to something spicy, noodles and chicken. Her response it's all good. Look the menu is overwhelming and a simple suggestion or two would have been helpful. Well my gigantic bowl of soup arrives and it is fabulous. A minute later here comes my entrée. I explained to the waitress I was not in a rush, the restaurant was 2/3rds empty at the time. Her response a smile and she leaves. The entrée was equally good and large but I expected that as I saw other plates being delivered. I also asked for a water which was served with no ice and was at room temperature, what the heck? And lastly they don't accept AMEX. Hey your new location is smack dab in the middle of multiple hotels which I'm sure is being populated by people on business most of whom use corporate AMEX cards.   Bottom line great food, servers are there to only deliver food as fast as possible, and bring your VISA card.  I did bring two large containers of leftovers back to my hotel and the folks at the front desk did enjoy the leftovers."}
{"text":"I went here twice in two days... because I didn't have a car and it was the only place I could walk to from my aunt's house.  It was either that or Wimpy's or Tim Horton's in the same plaza.  Give me some credit.  It was -15C when I walked.  That's cold for a California boy like me.    I was pretty impressed.  Modern interior, bright, clean.  It's HK cafe food, with an emphasis on congee (which I found out Toronto has a number of congee chains, something Los Angeles doesn't have).  About 30 different congees to choose from, from about $4.75 and up.  Up is $16.50 for a large bowl of Rock Crab Meat and Vegetarian Shark Fin Congee served in a Pumpkin Hot Pot.  I opted for something more sexy and exotic... the Chicken and Duck congee for $5.25.    Don't forget to order the you-tao (fried dough) for $1.70 to go with your congee.  Fried Tofu in Spice and Pepper Salt.  I love fried tofu.  This was done well.  Diced jalapenos, red peppers and garlic mixed in with a generous amount of crispy fried tofu chunks.  It was so intriguing that the African Canadian girl that was on a first date sitting next to me had to try one.    Beef with Black Bean & Green Peppers Fried Noodles.  This was standard HK fare.    It's really busy here on the weekends.  You'll probably have to wait 15-30 minutes.  Good food, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Again my compliant is that none of these awesome Chinese places are in Mississauga.  Food is awesome and price is right! There is so much variety. Takes me 10 minutes to read the menu and next table is done eating."}
{"text":"What more can I say but these guys just gets better and better.  Entrees: combo BBQ, clam Congee, stir fried lobster, snowpea sprouts, chili fried turnip  Delicious!  Efficient service  Beautiful decor  Competitive prices  Great authentic fresh ingredients & cookery  Convenience & free park  Soon delivery will be available too"}
{"text":"MSG is always expected at Chinese restaurants, and especially at such fast food places. However, the MSG in the wonton noodles' soup was so much that it was over powering. Luckily I don't have any allergic reaction to MSG, but for those who do, think twice about ordering or coming to this restaurant.   The noodles were fairly el dente, and there were plenty of shrimps while the wonton skin was very fresh and the wonton wasn't over cooked. This saved me from giving 2-stars to this restaurant. The other items were very average and as usual, I don't order congee from most restaurants when not in Asia because no one here ever makes it properly (I wonder why?).   Lastly, you can ask for no MSG, but I wonder if that means anything to the chef (other than him complaining about patrons being picky and annoying - I use to work at a Chinese restaurant and this IS what happens and don't be surprised if they add even more MSG to piss you off. I'm not implying that this place would do that. I'm only highlighting how some chefs may behave)."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an amazing Steamed Tilapia or Sea Bass whole fish experience, then this your place to be!! You order which fish to choose from live fish tank, and then wait for 20+ minutes... But it is worth the wait... Again the price tag is hefty $35 or more depending upon the size of the catch... But it is soft, tender and you can use Szechuan sauces to top it up as makes sense!!"}
{"text":"Just got here from Montreal and having dinner. Ordered a congee, roasted duck and Prince Fried rice. Really good and big portion."}
{"text":"My fiance, his family, and I came here for an HK style brunch on our first day in Markham. The restaurant hasn't changed since the last time I was here. It's still spacious, busy, and chic decor.   We ordered a lot of different dishes,  but didn't have a chance to take a picture of everything we had. However, I did manage to snap a couple of shots.   First, we had two bowls of congee.  Shredded Chicken & Duck with Egg Super Bowl Congee - tasted pretty good! I normally like to eat congee with chicken, pork, or with pork bone. It give a nice meaty flavor to the congee.   Lobster Super Bowl Congee - my fiance ordered this since it sounded interesting. I must admit I was a little disappointed by this congee because it was expensive compared to the rest: $23.99 to be exact! Yes they used a real lobster for the congee, but I was really hoping it would taste like lobster. I was hoping for a lobster-like broth or flavor, but nope.   Soy Sauce Pan-Fried Noodles - I started enjoying this dish a lot more because of my fiance. I love eating it whenever I have congee. Congee Queen's soy sauce pan-fried noodles were pretty good! Enough flavor for me!  Minced Beef Fried Rice - The minced beef fried rice tasted really good! It definitely didn't feel like it was left over fried rice, it actually tasted like fresh rice.  Sweet Cruller - My fiance's mom loves the sweet cruller. I've tried it before back in Brooklyn (where we live) and it didn't taste too good.  Steamed Rice Noodle Roll with Sesame - We ordered a plate of this and it was a very simple dish, not heavily seasoned or stuffed with anything like the other steamed rice noodle rolls.   Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll - I enjoy ordering this at dim sum, but sometimes it's a hit or miss. There are bakeries or restaurants where I have got this dim sum dish and the fritter wasn't crispy or crunchy at all, instead it would feel chewy and soggy. I'm glad the one we ordered was crunchy!  Pan-Fried Minced Beef & Golden Mushroom Rice Noodle Roll - This looked similar to a scallion pancake because it was pan-fried and had a nice crunch to it. I really enjoyed this rice noodle roll compared to the other ones we had. It was delicious, savory, and amazing.  We also had a roast pork over rice for my fiance's nephew since he loves roast pork very much!   Overall, the brunch here wasn't so bad. I liked most of the food we had. My fiance's family came back here on our last night in Markham for dinner and they had a terrible experience. One of the waitresses spilled water on my future sister in-law and the manager was quite rude to our family.  I guess it's a hit or miss at this Congee Queen. I particularly wouldn't mind coming here for brunch again since they seem to have an option of a small or large bowl of congee. I also like their assortment of rice noodle rolls."}
{"text":"This restaurant started off with negative stars due to the fact that when I ordered a Tsingtao off the menu, the waiter told me they don't have a liquor license.  What's up with that?  This location replaced Brix a while back, not sure what happened to it, they had good food and was always fairly busy.  They spent a lot on renovations and the place has dark wood, browns and grey throughout, but is very well lot with shiny disco type balls.  They somewhat redeemed themselves with the food.  The General Tao was fresh and crispy and the accompanying vegetables also fresh and not overcooked.    The lobster with ginger and green onion was beautifully presented, bright orange and green colours.  The lobster was cooked perfectly, but with all the onion and ginger it still ended up being a little bland.  It is likely because they needed to cook the vegetables more to get the flavour out.  The ginger was partly raw and they had not peeled the skin from the ginger.  I love to eat hunks of ginger along with the meat, but it just wasn't edible here.    All in all good quality food though and I would come back."}
{"text":"Great for groups.  Congee Queen serves classic cantonese cuisine. I usually come with a bunch of buddies for post-workout meals.  Pricing is super reasonable (per person) and the portions are big. Not to mention the food actually tastes on point.  Must-gets are the fried chilli turnip cakes, soft-shell crab fried rice and roast duck. Everything tastes good but if its your first time, get those 3 and add other stuff (if you're big eaters =P) and you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with 3 other family members. We ordered:  - small congee with chicken shreds and baby clams - stir fry flat rice noodle with ribs in black bean sauce - spicy soft shell crab fried rice  Chicken Congee: There were plenty of large chunks of chicken shreds in the congee, but wasn't very tasty and texture was a bit rough. Maybe I just prefer tender soft dark meat chicken pieces instead in my chicken congee. Baby clams (quarter size), there was about 6 in the bowl. A small bowl is more than enough to share between 4 people unless you like eating a lot of congee.  Noodles: Black bean rib noodles was good. Plenty of sauce and meat and black bean sauce wasn't too salty.  Fried Rice: Spicy soft shell crab fried rice was not spicy at all. In fact, it didn't taste like anything, like plain rice. I added in the missing spicy taste with the chili oil from the table.  The restaurant was very spacious with lots of seating, especially comfy booth seats. Décor was clean, modern, pretty and comfortable and overall ambiance is great for a congee and noodle restaurant. Washroom looks clean too.  Service is good and quick.  So far I think I like the food from Keung's Delight more. But environment is nicer here.  Despite the mediocre chicken congee and fried rice, it was nice to eat here with family and I would come back here to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"The Chinese food here tastes great. Really authentic and good but the menu is hard to read since there's no pictures and I can't read Chinese. The service isn't good either but I'm here for the food."}
{"text":"Good all round Hong Kong cha chaan tang good."}
{"text":"Mmm....congee. That's exactly what my friends ordered when we sat down. Along with congee, we had cantonese chow mein and turnip patties. The congee was hearty and the turnip patties were my favorite. They looked like little fried potato cubes, but when you bite into it, you taste softy goodness. It came with egg too! I kept eating out of that particular dish out of the rest. We did order one more dish, but I can't seem to remember what it was...but it was not memorable at all. Let's just call it the forgotten dish. This is my only criticism, the forgotten dish was not as tasty and it was definitely not up to par with the rest of the dishes that we ordered.   This restaurant looks pretty high end  and the service is quick quick quick! I have no complaints about that! I think Chinese food in Toronto, personally speaking, tastes better than in Montreal. But that's just me.   My tummy was totally  satisfied and my taste buds were thankful Definitely check out this place if you want some Chinese food and you're in the Scarborough area."}
{"text":"I've dined here about 4 or 5 times over the past 2 years and the value you get is tremendous if you split various dishes for several people.  I usually come here with a group of 4 and the variety of food is impressive from many types of congee dishes, various noodle and rice dishes, dumplings and meat and vegetable dishes.  Every group I've gone with has always been satisfied after a meal which usually around $10 all-in when in a group of four.  The place is fairly clean and generally has a nice decor.  The closest franchise I can compare this to is Congee Time, and I would rate Congee Queen a bit higher since the place appears cleaner.  Service-wise, the place is standard, but to me this is less important than the quality of the food.  Congee Queen offers a excellent amount of variety for groups of people with unique tastes, with above reasonable quality food at excellent value.  If you are just ordering single dishes, you might be underwhelmed.  The key is to order multiple dishes to share amongst a group of 4 or 5 ideally."}
{"text":"If you ever wanted to come to a restaurant for some classic Chinese Cantonese food, then Congee Queen is place to go. For all the times over the years I have ate at Congee Queen, there is one thing that they always do right: Good customer service.  Out of all the Chinese restaurants I have eaten at, the servers at Congee Queen want to provide the best for their customers. When I went to have a nice meal with my friends, I was very impressed with the service we received. They were very attentive and quick on their feet in terms of whenever out tea pot required a refill. That was very  nice. I have not received amazing service for a very long time.   In terms of the food, I feel like I'm back in Hong Kong whenever I take a bite into the dishes. There is a vast selection of food, even extending to Thai and Viet specialties.  Expect to see the standard dishes on the menu (Fried Rice, Fried Noodles, Congee, Stir Fried DIshes) and you will not be disappointed for any selection you make.  In terms of dishes I would recommend, try ordering the Stir Fried Turnip Patties, Seafood Congee, or the Salt and Pepper Squid.   So , the next time you want to have a nice , flavourful, and fresh meal, then don't hesitate,  Congee Queen is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Empress Fried Rice with Eel and Conpoy was delicious. The fried rice was the best dish we had! Hong Kong Style Sir-fried Lobster was tasty. Super bowl was filled with shrimp, scallops, grouper, salmon and surf clams. Service was confused but food came out fast. Lots of incorrect food being delivered and it took a while to be greeted but it was their first week. The congee is good if not unspectacular. Their other dishes are spectacular."}
{"text":"I don't exactly remember what my aunt and cousins ordered but I do remember leaving with the impression that this was a delicious Chinese restaurant.  For a place called Congee Queen, everything non congee on the menu was really good also.  You can also go across the way in this plaza to a sports bar (I forget the name of) and watch the hilarious sport they call Canadian football.  Go Blue Bombers!"}
{"text":"Normally I really like this place... good flavors and good value. I was there recently and it was busy so I got take out.  my MSI complaint is with the city beef brisket on rice.  there were about 5 pieces of meat but only 1 was really meat... the other 4 were fat... not fat and meat but just fat and silver skin.  if this were my first meal with them they would have given 1 star... but I know they are usually better. Please consider trimming the fat a little more before cooking."}
{"text":"Great decor, delicious Cantonese food, good prices.  MAKE A RESERVATION!  Good parking, walkable from Finch station.  This place is BRAND SPANKING NEW and my parents kindly treated our family out to dinner here to celebrate my BRAND SPANKING NEW marriage!  What a great choice!  The food was spot on & delicious.  They were swamped and we still got our food in a prompt manner, they refilled our tea quickly, and they managed my mom's prima donna 'tude pretty well (she's a diva!).    We ordered a dozen dishes, here are the ones I remember: - ho fun (delicious) - shrimp wonton noodle soup (all shrimp & noodles were cooked perfectly, A+ in my books) - sautéed lobster (good flavor, not the easiest to eat) - pineapple fried rice (my mom didn't like this, others were content) - gulu chicken (didn't try, people said good things) - fried fish (great flavor & super-crispy, non-greasy breading) - beef w/ gai lan (the gai lan tasted amazing, others said beef was good) - dou miao (delicious & tender)"}
{"text":"My friend lives near by so I visit when I'm in the area. The food is pretty solid every visit. I would recommend the turnips, beef and broccoli, mango with shrimp/chicken and congee of course. Congee is a great comfort food during these winter months...  Also, make reservations, it is always packed."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Good portion and great price. Congee was boiled and simmered to perfection!"}
{"text":"Passed by and decided to try this restaurant.  No line up on weekday lunch hour and service is fast and  friendly.  I ordered  stir fried beef w chinese  brocoli and steam rice. Food came our fast and good portion. Very fresh , tasty  and favorable.  Definitely  will repeat."}
{"text":"The food was prettyyyyy damn good. We had spring onion vermicelli which were de-lish, some congee, bubble tea, pork chops and shrimps. All of this was pretty good and cheap.  The service however was real bad. The waiter was very rude to us even though we're really easy going customers.   Don't know if the food balances out the bad service :/"}
{"text":"My McDonald's of Chinese cuisine.  Quick,  plentiful and at a good price.   Not much to complain about so long as you are going in knowing it's the McD and not the Keg.  Staple places when craving some quick congee and noodles..."}
{"text":"3 stars out of 5  We ordered the Salmon Congee and Chicken Fried Rice.  The place feels more spacious than the other Congee Queens, perhaps because we went at 6pm but it gets busy closer to 7pm.  The Salmon Congee has enough salmon and was nice and hot.  Not bad for $7.  The Chicken Fried Rice had a good portion but there wasn't much chicken in the rice (see picture).  Overall, we felt the place was average."}
{"text":"By no stretch of imagination am I conessieur of Chinese cuisine. I have no authority to judge whether the food served here is authentic Chinese or not even close. But I do happen to be an authority on judging whether I enjoyed my dining experience or not even close. And in this case...I thorroughly enjoyed my dining experience :) Congee queen is quite a popular restaurant chain. It has a loyal clientele and happens to be a thriving business.   The atmosphere is pretty decent, clean, and active. The staff is polite and helpful, which is a big plus. Right from the host greeting us, to our server, to everyone else we interacted with during the evening. The menu is tempting, as almost every dish sounds delicious and worth trying. We went for the crowd favourites for our first visit to this joint: Cantonese chow mein with seafood and meats, turnip patties, and bbq duck. The portions sizes are plentiful, we had carry home almost our entire portion of chow mein, and half of the the turnips dish as the two of us were completely full by the time we made our way through the half bbq duck. The bbq duck was delicious. Only thing I missed was the crispy skin, but I guess they were not going for that. But it was still a very good dish. The turnip patties though their most popular dish, was still a surprise to us. The dish was amazing, and absolutely worth ordering every single time. We were surprised that turnips could be made to taste like that....I guess you can deep fry anything on this planet and make it taste awesome. Cantonese chowmein was also pretty good. They were kind enough to pack us some extra sauce for it. We noticed, almost all regular customers there had their favourtes in terms of sauces, and the servers were happy to fetch them. Overall a great experience, that has made Congee Queen our new favourite Chinese restaurant in Toronto/North York."}
{"text":"We got the Cantonese chow Mein, calamari and the turnips. Really good service really good food"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot if you're looking for fast service and a diverse selection Chinese food. Just don't bank on the quality.  We came here at around 9pm, and this place was still quite lively with small groups and families. With a menu that probably consisted of 10+ pages, it was quite overwhelming for us first-timers. Eventually we settled on a plate of bbq pork, the turnip patties that everyone raved about, a beef noodle soup and the shredded pork & preserved egg congee.  At 9pm, I was starving, and Congee Queen did not disappoint with their speed. I am honestly a bit suspicious as to how they can whip together these dishes in the span of 10 minutes.  I was most impressed and surprised by the barbecue pork. It was juicy, saucy and quite tender. The turnip patties were great as well - they had a creamy texture and the spice added a kick. I was only able to have ~5 pieces however, as they were on the heavier side. The other dishes I probably would not get again, but I would be open to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Come for the food. Not the service.  The congee queen and king chain are all over the place but i think this one is by far the best one.  Its very well kept, spacious and clean compared to the older ones.  Its decor Is also much newer  In terms of the food, the congee of course is the must have with good price.  I feel the waitress do not have firm grasp of sizing... for example, we asked how many bowls (The small asian bowls used in this place) are typically in the small congee. They told us probably 3-4 but in truth there were at least 6 bowls of congee. So don't worry you will not get hungry.   They also have some pretty good side dish.  We like the steamed fish and vegetables. The stoneware rice with chashu is also pretty tasty. The vegetarian fried rice wowed our guests so much that they insisted on making one last trip before leaving the country.   The service here is inconsistent, unfortunately. Seems to be up to their moods. Most of the time they get their job done. But once or twice we found their patience lacking when we phoned for takeouts or if visit close to closing time.    I think this is like a place you can come day to day, but not the special occasion type of place, and for its price range, it successfully occupies the niche it aims for."}
{"text":"We ordered from here last night. It was disappointing. - $54 we got fried rice, which was tasteless -Cantonese chow mien, the noodles were so crispy which I wasn't used to or expected.  Maybe it's authentic? Not sure. -the duck, (which was raved about on Yelp). It was good, but had more bones than meat.  -the chow mein came with this side sauce. It was more like a soup with mixed vegetables, seafood & meat. I didn't order this seafood mixture, so we were confused as to what was in it. Thanks to the Internet we figured out it was octopus. Neither of us ate it. -sweet & sour chicken was alright.  -spring rolls came with 3. I thought that was a weird number and they honestly weren't that good. I was so sad about the meal.  I wouldn't order from them again, but I'd maybe try going into the restaurant. Maybe if there's pictures of the food on the menu I'd have better luck. Or maybe waitstaff could help?"}
{"text":"Congee Queen has been a favourite of ours for many, many years, especially when looking for quick, casual, non-bland Chinese food. They have an exceptional quality/quantity to price ratio aka pretty cheap. Opens late too.  This location near Don Mills/Steeles is usually pretty consistent, both in terms of the dishes they roll out and the service they provide. You don't really come here for fantastic service, as it's all about being speedy to fulfill hunger. Order something and it'll be in front of your face on the table within 5 minutes.  Line ups can be ridiculous during dinner hours. Weekdays included! Prepare to get a ticket.  Also it gets loooud here. Plates, chatter, all that jazz.  Recommendations: shrimp and scrambled egg fried rice noodles (huge portions, mix it well), turnip cakes (the best, love the shrimp and egg they add into the fried mix), black bean sauce beef noodles, the yin-yang style shrimp/chicken tomato/cream dish, kung pao chicken."}
{"text":"CQ is always a reliable pick for a satisfying meal. This location is no different. Big portions, good prices, and above average food.  Surprisingly, I rarely get congee at Congee Queen, since their other Chinese dishes are so vast and I always crave them. The best congee if I do feel like congee would be the seafood special. Mix in a little of their special chili oil (which comes with a spicy meat texture paste mmm) and its heavenly.  Service here is a bit slower than their other branches but not too bad.  Recommendations: the \"yinyang\" fried rice dish topped with half cream sauces shrimps and half tomato sauced pork, the scrambled egg and beef/shrimp fried rice noodles, kung pao chicken, beef and broccoli, rice rolls wrapped with youtiao and dried pork floss, and turnip patties are always a must.  Reliable consistent meals for a quick lunch or dinner. Warning. There will be line ups if you go during dinner time so try making resos."}
{"text":"I took my grandma here for lunch the other day because I didn't know where else to take her and it was close to her home.   As per most Asian restaurants, service is next to none. We were seated and I had to flag someone down to take our order, flag someone down again for water, and flag someone down for our bill. Our bill took a while, so I walked up to the counter to pay. Servers were at the host stand talking to each other and seemed disinterested in doing their job.   Onto food... We ordered the preserved egg and pork congee, turnip cakes, and Cantonese fried noodles.   Our congee must have been the end of the pot or something because it was very thick. Flavour was there, but the texture is hard to get past. Turnip cakes were alright, nothing out of this world, but I enjoy my turnip cakes. Cantonese fried noodles were decent too.   Their food is decent and cheap. If you want a cheap meal and have time to wait for service, this would be a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from this place and when I was eating it I saw a cooked bug. I almost ate it. Needless to say I won't be coming back. Food tasted alright though."}
{"text":"Beware of hidden charges, which are not posted. Charged an extra dollar for taking left-over red bean drink home. Charged extra for ordering duck feet, instead of both duck feet & wings."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of their locations now and my experience has all been very similar - fast, efficient service with good, satisfying food. I've always ordered the same items despite wanting to try other things on their extensive menu but my go-to dishes are just too good to trade out.   Empress Eel Fried Rice ($13.50) - My absolute favourite although not cheap. Eel, fish roe, crab meat and bonito flakes. Such an awesome combination especially with the eel sauce and I like that it's not too salty. I wish they'd add more eel but perhaps that's just me being greedy.  Fried Chilli Turnip Patties ($7.50) - After my first time trying the turnip patties here, I've tried ordering it at many Chinese restaurants to only be met with disappointment. It has a bit of a kick to it but SO tasty. The turnip patties here are like no other and I'd highly recommend having it with a bowl of congee. Yum.  Salt & Pepper Squid ($9.50) - A very popular, safe item and rightfully so due to its versatility. It goes well with pretty much any rice, noodle or congee that you could order. Some people have mentioned that it often comes out soggy but luckily, I've never encountered it.   Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll ($4.75) - So simple yet so good. The rice noodle is very thin so it doesn't overshadow the dough fritter. The sauce to dip adds the perfect flavour and completes the dish.  They open late, food comes out quick, portions are solid. Although prices are on the higher end, it doesn't stop me from coming.  Oh, Congee Queen. You get me every time."}
{"text":"What can I say about this Congee Queen, or even other locations: severe overcrowding, bad air circulation, insanely busy where staff will forget about patrons.  So I came here for dinner with family. Venue is packed. We had a reservation and were told to be 15 mins early. So I thought, our table ought to have a \"Reserve\" sign posted on it. That was not the case. The front desk told me, they will \"try\" to get us a table of 10 in 20 - 30 mins. That to me is unacceptable. The reason being why would you tell me to show up early and not RESERVE the table for the booking. Another issue I found with Congee Queen is, there is certain rivalry between some of the staff. Example is, the staff will \"fight\" amongst themselves to have their own favourite customers seated at the 1st free table. Isn't that a bit wrong? I am absolutely appalled with this establishment.   Food, nothing much can be said considering I had a bad experience with seating arrangements and lack of air circulation. Let just say, food is just edible. However, the overall experience is so dreadful that whatever food I consumed is simply not worth it.   I only have one recommendation: stay away from this Congee Queen. If I can give a zero or even a negative grade, I will."}
{"text":"Came to this CQ location for the first time tonight for an after dinner snack. Happy to see no line ups since it was almost 11pm. Plus points for being open late. The decor here is fantastic and more airy due to high ceilings.  My usual CQ dishes include their seafood congees, fried rice noodles with shrimp and scrambled egg sauce, black bean beef noodles, kung pao chicken, tomato and cream yingyang style dish of chicken shrimp on rice, and fried turnip cakes. However, since we came so late, we ordered something different to try - bad idea.  They have a newish paper menu to create your own noodle soup bowl that is almost identical to Deer Gardens, even the add on side dishes price and options are similar, probably too much competition. We chose thick rice noodles in fish broth with shrimp wontons and beef balls for toppings. This dish was $9.75 before tax/tip and offered significantly less noodles than Deer Garden. Also the included drink when made cold was an extra 75 cents which would be fine if it were indicated on the ordering form.  Also tried their satay chicken skewers on mango, and there were very cheap small amounts of thin mango slices and the chicken skewers were overly burnt. For $11, I could get a lot more at Thai/Vietnamese restaurants.  Stick with the basic signature CQ dishes and you should be fine. Based on this first experience at this location, I give it a 2 stars as both the price and portion that I come to expect of a CQ was not justified here tonight. Paid $28 total for two dishes as a late night snack and left not satisfied."}
{"text":"I love Congee Queens food.   They forgot our dish but that's fine by me as they were bait. What I don't like at times is when the server goes, \" yeah yeah, coming\" and gives US as a look when I'm not even demanding anthem more than what we ordered.   Other Han that, man , I would still come back, and listen to \"it's coming\". I like the battered squid, the empress fried rice, and the BBQ meat. This time, I selected BBQ duck, and it did not disappointment my aching tastebuds.   I had, hmm, other dishes but none I would feel strongly that you shouldn't miss. It's a go to lunch place for .... CONGee and miscellaneous dishes."}
{"text":"This franchise has become our dining spot/chain of choice, particularly when we're in \"default\" mode - and why not?  Yes there's often a line during the lunch and dinner rush hours, and 'intimate' is not the first word you'll think of (i.e., take your boy-/girl-friend some other place for a romantic VD-type dinner), but the food is usually of decent quality.  Prices have slowly crept up, even when one's mindful of the difference in exchange rate between CAD and USD, but it's still pretty good value, as portions are usually large.  Service can be spotty when they get busy, but on this visit, it was good."}
{"text":"Pretty good congee and soup.  Decor and service are above average for a Chinese restaurant (or maybe I've just gotten used to disinterested, likely underpaid waiters at other places).  Also, really liked their rice rolls (the fried one was a bit unusual, but I think we liked it - how's that for a resounding endorsement?).  We mistakenly ordered the Szechuan Beef which was not terrible, but also not very inspired, so I'd stick to the things they show you pictures of in the menu."}
{"text":"A taste of Hong Kong in Toronto. Service is good. Seating in comfortable. For Sunday lunch it is 90% full by 12:20.  Seafood congee is delightful. Sweet and sour pork is a kids favourite. The salt and pepper deep fried squid has a great kick which is perfect for this cold winter day, and tryly a yummy dish. The Cantoneese noodles were excellent and not greasy which is often the case.   Bubble tea, nai cha, is green tea based as opposed to milk based. Child#2 still loves it and drinks it all. Can Mango ever fail as another kids fav?  They do not serve dim sum, but the brunch crowd is 99% Asian/Chinese. Me being the sole exception on this occassion. We will be back."}
{"text":"Food is good. But I got really really really sick after having lunch there. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"As with all the other Congee Queen locations, I've experienced the same level of service and quality of food which is actually kinda impressive considering how many locations there are.   Obviously with most Chinese restaurants, you shouldn't expect the best service but overall Congee Queen is a-ok. Dishes will arrive sporadically and often you'll be almost done your meal before your last dish arrives. Certain dishes like Congee or appetizers will arrive a little quicker than others like the fried turnip cakes which always seems to take exceptionally long. On the bright side, you could always pack leftovers to take home.   The quality of the food overall is quite good, I find it's better than a lot of other Chinese restaurants. I would highly recommend the fried turnip cakes, any congee (make sure you try it with the fried donut), the clay pot eggplant, and their BBQ meats."}
{"text":"This joint is always busy. I came here twice and both times, I've waited around 30-40 minutes to be seated. I came on a Sunday evening around 5:30pm last time and there was a huge crowd waiting to be seated. Luckily the food does come quite quickly. I would recommend everyone to look at the menu while you're waiting to be seated so you can order as soon as you sit down which means you can spend less time waiting and more time eating."}
{"text":"By far the best of the congee queen and Wong franchise restaurants! Love the food here and enjoy it all the time. I'll remember to take pics next time for viewing. Highly recommend this location. The staff are friendly and spoke English. Downside is the location is always busy!!! I wish they would expand their restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The service is much faster now. I guess they realized how slow they were before. The food are the same as before. Average. The down side is the plate are so large one person can not eat it all and it goes to waste unless you take it home."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 items as per my picture attached, this is for 4 people.  Service was not there at this location. Maybe because they have just opened.   Food came really fast after ordering around 10 mins. Price was reasonable compared to other Chinese restaurants in Mississauga but a bit on the pricey side for dinner. The ambiance at this restaurant was excellent, it's very well lit and bright. I like it.  Food tasted excellent. All 4 adults on the table agreed.  We didn't have a server until the bill was ready to be paid. We weren't asked what drinks we wanted and they just brought us the tea to the table quick and left.  Service is still not there at this restaurant. It has a fast food feel right now. Maybe because they just opened.  Will I come back again? Definitely. Most likely for take out because line up at the door for a table is crazy!!!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is my go to for Cantonese style cuisine. My preferred location would have to be at Leslie/Hwy 7 but I find myself coming to this location more often for the convenience. It's always busy at this location but the wait time is no more than 10mins usually.   We ordered a bowl of chicken and corn soup, noodles in scrambled egg sauce, and hong Kong Style lobster.  This place is my favourite place for lobster and every time I order it, I'm never disappointed. The chicken and corn soup was good and tasted balanced. Not salty and all and the corn adds a sweetness to the soup that works. The noodles in scrambled egg sauce was average. I didn't enjoy it as much as the other two dishes."}
{"text":"Went to this Congee queen at around 930 or so pm on a sunday. This is the flagship branch, and although i've been here many times before. I think this time it could be either we ordered something they are not very good with, or perhaps it is near closing time.   So had ordered the bbq pork rice, which is pretty standard stuff. and the one that is one their feature new menu, the teriyaki seafood hot plate osaka noodle.  The BBQ pork rice, was very dry, and it showed. however it was near closing time so i will give them that the bbq pork has probably been cooked since the beginning of the day, and i've had their bbq pork before at this location. it was not bad. This time however it wasn't good at all. so i would advise come earlier or during main dinner service times.   The Teriyaki Seafood hot plate, was simply not a good dish. it tasted nothing like teriyaki. in fact it was soy sauce fried noodle, with very few seafood if any. And on top of that, it was simply just a salty flavor, not anything special at all. it felt like regular Chinese fried noodle.  However this dish also costed 12.99 which is way overpriced for what they gave us. definitely would recommend against it to anyone.  The service is quick and  efficient, so no complaints. i would go to this location earlier during prime lunch or dinner hours, and you will probably receive better food. it is not a late night place you want to hit near closing."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a monday lunch, with someone. This location is the newest of the line of Congee Queens, and honestly it is pretty good. Although Congee queen has quite a few locations within toronto/markham area, it is not all the same cooking competency.   For Lunch we picked a Roasted duck Rice noodle soup, and a Sweet and sour chicken rice. These are both pretty standard dishes, i find the Roasted duck was pretty good in the noodle soup. Although the noodle soup itself is not a very big flavour, the duck is pretty good, it is moist on the inside and crispy on the skin which is pretty good.   The Sweet and sour chicken is pretty standard, as it has a good meat to dough ratio which is more meat then dough, and for 7.95+ tax which includes soup and spring roll. it is pretty good  definetely up to the congee queen standard so for those around this neighbourhood i would say if you liked the other congee queens this would definetely be just as good.   the only reason it is not a 5 star is because it is not a place that will wow you in food, the cooking was not perfect, but good enough."}
{"text":"You ever see that Seinfeld episode where they go into the soup shop and you have to know what you want or you don't served? I feel like that at A LOT of good Chinese restaurants.  While Congee Queen isn't that extreme, I feel weird if I don't order within the first 2-3 minutes of sitting down.  We usually get our food within 10 minutes of sitting down and spend the next 20-25 eating it so we are in and out within an hour.    Regardless, I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Cheap, big portions, good portions, fast service (not very talkative) and fairly clean.   Recommended Dishes:   -Empress Fried Rice (this is Eel fried rice with some other meats and seafoods).  Some of you may not be that adventurous, but this tastes like chicken with a very sweet sauce on top of yeung chow style fried rice.  It's a bit pricey for Chinese restaurant at almost $15, but it's worth it.    -Salt N Pepper Squid - ever had golden fried calamari or salt n pepper pork chop? Well mix the two together and this is the flavour you get (btw, no there isn't pork, all squid and it's not round).    -Chili turnip cakes- not too spicy, small kick, but very tasty.  It's not as bad as it sounds (us Chinese really need to learn better marketing skills).  When I talk to my white friends, I say the name and they are like \"eww\" but when they have it, they are like \"OMG, this is so good\".  How can I explain it? Umm...I have no clue..try it..it's GOOD!  -Any sizzling plate with meat.  I love sizzling food! Be warned, wash your clothes immediately after or else you'll reek like an old grill.  Overall, if you want good food and don't care much for service, go here, because it has seriously good food."}
{"text":"I tried this place finally last Sunday before the 6pm dinner rush (i came at 5:30pm) and saw how busy at at 6 o'clock there was a line up outside the door; good thing I read some yelp reviews to come before 6. Anyway let's start off by saying that this location is clean, bright and Airy. The service is very quick from the time I sat down and I perused the menu from when I ordered my food. The food came within 10 minutes I was in shock pleasantly shocked; I turned around and there was my Lobster efu noodles, shortly after, my next few dishes came one after another! Loved that !  The flavour, quantity and taste of all my items with the exception of the fried chicken (was slightly dry )were cooked perfectly - I will definitely be coming back to try more items. The price point is fair & in keeping with most chinese restaurants in the area.   Quick break down of items we had:  Roast pork on rice - tender & juicy pork crispy skin! ; good ratio of fat to pork (sometimes I like the leaner part of the pork which is what we got) Spicy fried squid - tender, simple & delicious  Lobster in green onion & ginger sauce with EFU noodles - tender perfectly cooked lobster pieces in a delicate mild sauce & noodles soft & chewy  Beef & Choy sum - tender yummy  Fried dough fritter cheung fan - crisp on inside & well made cheung fun (not too thick & chewy) love the tree sauces to dip or pour.  Fried chicken - crispy skin good but overcooked & dry (won't order again)  Lastly, I had great service from a few servers - there was always someone near for me to get either another napkin,  more drinks."}
{"text":"All my friends have been talking about Congee Queen since I arrived here in 2016 but it is only now that I have had a chance to see what all the hub bub is all about.   Pretty nice decor with comfy booths. Staff are not the warmest. Holy moly! They have a very extensive menu; I was overwhelmed with the available choices. Glad I came with friends who knew the menu; I trusted them to order.  Fried Bean Curd Braised with Vegetable - pretty good  Beef With Mushroom on Sizzling plate - had tons of onion, beef was tender, it was tasty.   House Super Bowl (Seafood) Congee - was HUGE! Loved the seafood especially the tender scallops but the surf clam was super chewy bleh! Needed some chili oil.    Fried rice - not bad  Food comes out quick and hot, service is quick and attentive. Decent food at decent prices; I can see why my friends like it here.   Rating based on lunch service on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"consistently great chinese food.  this restaurant and all their chains are extremely successful. theres always a lineup..not sure if thats a good thing or bad thing but the food is great so that makes sense.  the service is fast and efficient and take out is easy.  ill alawys keep coming back here and their practically open all the time.  great restaurant hours.  the menu is vast and the assortment is amazing."}
{"text":"The food here was good but it was not the best Chinese food I've ever had in my life of course. The general tso chicken was a lot better than the Szechuan beef which was good but it was lacking some flavor. The thing that was really strange though was that there was a crazy lineup and the lady told us it was only going to be a 10-15 minute wait Max and we only ended up waiting about seven minutes. anyway we sat down and quickly figured out what we were going to order. My husband and I were fasting since it was our holy month of Ramadan and we figured it would take about 20 minutes to get our food so we placed our order about 25 minutes in advance before it was time to break our fast. It literally felt like they brought out the food within five minutes. So then our food and my drinks out there for another 20 minutes basically getting cold or melting in the case of my drink. Of course it's not their fault and this is awesome crazy fast service even faster than fast food I would say but I guess I had no idea it would take such a short amount of time to get the food. We also ordered wings which now we know in the future not to order because they give you some of the worst part of the wings which barely has any meat about eight wings and they charge you $12 so it's definitely not worth it. The wings took a normal amount of time about 20 minutes to come in so they came right as soon as we were breaking our fast. We just looked foolish sitting there with their food in front of us not eating LOL they must've thought there was something wrong with us since we were waiting but obviously we were just waiting for sunset so we can break our fast. So the menu is extremely large and very confusing because there are so many items that you just get confused. There's also no indication that the meat dishes do not come with the rice and then you have to order separate rice unless you are ordering off the rice page in which certain items come with some meat on the side such as the general tso chicken rice.  These are the things we ordered:  -General tso chicken rice (from rice page) A good single serving of the meat and the rice $11.95 if we came back we will probably just get two orders of this and call it a day -Szechuan beef- good large portion but felt under seasoned and needed more sauce $13.95 includes no rice -egg fried rice $7 (no veggies included, large portion, a bit weird since it had nothing in it) -honey garlic wings too much honey super sticky less garlic and crappy portions of wings given to us 11.95 -mango freeze with tapioca $7 delicious but very overpriced"}
{"text":"Super busy with lots of standing while waiting.  There are three seats in the back by the washroom which came in handy for those of senior age.  Otherwise, you have to stand and wait.  By the way for those who haven't been here, make sure you get your ticket from the hostess, before you stand and wait.  Although it was very busy, the turnover was pretty quick, despite all those standing and waiting, we were seated within 35-40 minutes.  The food is tasty and there are new \"Queen\" menu options.  There are some cool additions like ramen chinese-japanese fusion noodles, octopus or salmon fried rice etc.  We ordered the usual cantonese chow mien, turnips, congee, hot pot rice, beef etc.  The portions are average not heaping.  The price for 7 items was $100 approximately before tip, which is not the cheapest for Chinese food.  However, the consensus was that the food was tasty.  The service is quick and they are more than willing to provide plates, water, spoon and forks without an attitude, which is great.  No conversing with the servers, as the focus is on efficiency rather than friendliness.  They do need the efficiency because there were non-stop new customers lining up in the front door."}
{"text":"This place was packed on a late sunday night. They food that we ordered came out super fast and tasted really good. We had two different kinds of fried rice and of course the Congee. We had the thousand year old egg and pork congee. The kids loved the squid plate. we had it two different ways, deep fried and pan fried. Only complaint was that towards the end of our dinner the waitress came by and took my condiment tray away, thinking they were going to refill the soy, salt, and peeper etc. We were still in the middle of our meal and needed it. They looked at us like why do you still need it we (staff) need to clean up for the night! My four stars are for the food and 1 star if i could for the staff."}
{"text":"The East Side Mario's of Pan-Asian eateries in the GTA. Always bustling & loud. Large, modern interior. Service is efficient & swift. Pricing is fair. Menu has plenty to offer and portion size is generous. Turnip cakes and fried rice...high marks on those. Love the concept of the Congree Queen brand. BUT...alas, the food on the whole is assembly-line quality and uninspiring. MSG & chicken powder seem to be the two main ingredients of choice. And ironically, congee is a big fail here. Taste is always a little off (fishy cross-contamination maybe?). Agree with other comments relating to \"foul\" food, I have found less-than-fresh meats here in the chow mein as well. Time for a kitchen re-evaluation."}
{"text":"My family is in Toronto for one day to attend a funeral. The long drive, emotionally trying day and the extremely cold weather (I am currently wearing two jackets as I type this up!) have us craving some serious comfort food.  Enter, Congee Queen. My family of seven sat down and we each ordered a bowl of congee for ourselves when the waiter interrupted us and told us that two bowls was actually PLENTY for our family. So we settled upon the House Special which was chock full o' firm white fish, salmon, lobster, and other seafood goodness and the Duck, Chicken and Egg. The raw egg was buried deep inside the congee so when we stirred it, the yolk broke and slowly cooked in the hot broth. Hellllooooooo nurse!  The congee was silky smooth and my dad assured me that it tasted just like the food he had while living in Hong Kong. My 3 year old neice was very excited because the porridge temperature was \"just right\" which was perfect for a baby bear like her.   The service left a little something to be desired but that is expected at most Asian restaurants.   The total damage? About $35 for a family of seven that includes two growing, thirteen year old boys and one extra hungry Yelp Community Manager. This is how much we usually spend on a McDonalds meal for all of us! We left absolutely stuffed.   Kimberly V Tip: Add white pepper and roasted chili oil to your congee for a spicy kick!"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite Chinese restaurant ever.   Before Congee Queen opened, I used to go to Congee Dynasty (for anyone who remembers it). I love any restaurant that's based around congee because it makes the best Chinese food in my opinion.   I came on a Sunday evening around 6pm and had to wait about an hour for a table for 8 people. The waiting area is pretty packed and I highly recommend reserving a table if you're coming in a weekend evening.   Anyways on to the food!   We got a big bowl of seafood congee, the texture was perfect. Not too mushy or wet. Came with a huge selection of seafood in the congee.   We got two types of noodles, the dry beef ho fun and wet seafood ho fun. Both were great too, usually it's really greasy or they lack on beef or seafood at other places but this place packs it on.   We also got orders of the shrimp noodle rolls and doughnut noodle rolls. For the shrimp I'd prefer it not to have the ginger(?) bamboo(?), I'm not quite sure what's in it but I rather it not be in there. The doughnut noodle rolls were good and they give you a lot of it too!  Overall, really like this place. Tremendous, Emerald and Sam Woo is really getting a run for their money against Congee Queen."}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.   Seriously this is the second time in a row that I've been to this Congee Queen location and have been completely ignored. The first time I thought it was the non-Asian factor as I went with my very Caucasian mother. But this time I was with my very Asian husband and were still passed by for 15 minutes when trying to wave down a server.   I had to ask for side plates, ask 3 times for a plastic spoon, and kept sending dishes back with waiters that weren't ours BECAUSE NO ONE HAD TAKEN OUR ORDER YET!!!  Also - who sits a couple and a baby and a table for two? You know at any Chinese food place you're going to order at least 3-4 dishes and combine that with a grabby 6month old what do you have? That's right: floor food. And floor food my friends just isn't as yummy as table food. We had to ask for an additional table to keep the kid from grabbing the BBQ pork (though who could blame him, pork is delicious!).  They do have a few saving graces: excellent food, super prices and TONS of high chairs. But I believe that eating out is mostly about experience, and we definitely didn't have a good one at this location."}
{"text":"It is my favourite restaurant by far. We have visited three different locations and love them all. Very fair prices and vast selections. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Congee with fresh clams has very good texture and the clams are fresh. Also ordered udon and rice sticks in soup. Soup base for both are good and tasty. Personally I prefer the rice sticks over udon."}
{"text":"I love this place. Love  the food. Its decent food and its not too expensive. I usually come here with at least 2-4 other people and share a bunch of dishes. It usually ends up costing us about $9-17 each person. We always leave stuffed and have occasionally ended up with leftovers to doggy-bag.  The food quality is pretty consistent. Though I have had one time where they forgot the seasoning/garnish when it was busy for them.  Service is meh. Worse the busier they are. It can be hard flagging down a server, when they're all running around like chickens with their heads chopped off. I suggest making sure your bowls, cups etc are clean especially when they're busy. I've noticed that during their peak times, i'll find something stuck to a bowl or spoon. The line up for a table is crazy sometimes. If there are some other tables on the patio, then the service is slightly better on the patio. Beware if you're the 1st or 2nd table on the patio, then service isn't hot.  Love the turnip patties and their fried squid."}
{"text":"This is my favorite casual Chinese eatery. There's always a line up around peak times and for good reason. Great place for congee, noodle soups, rice dishes, bbq, some seafood options, and other Cantonese dishes. They have pho and pad Thai options too. I try to come on off peak times but the tables move fast even if you're waiting. Was here last night for dinner and had the Garoupa bean curd hot pot, bbq platter, sirloin beef in nest, pork chop lai fun noodle soup. My first time trying the hot pot and the Garoupa has a lot of tiny bones. Everything tasted great and service was fast and friendly. Only thing is washrooms need an upgrade and the soap dispenser is always broken which makes me question cleanliness of staff. Change this please!"}
{"text":"This place is always good. Good food! Reasonable price.. but it's always packed here. haha."}
{"text":"yummmm!! def going back... awesome hot and sour soup seafood fried rice and everything else..:)"}
{"text":"This place is GIANT. ANd the place is always full too. The prices are really cheap, $5.50 for a beef noodle soup thats a big size! The sweet and sour fish, the dou jiang (soy milk), and the crispy noodles in a swallows nest were good. The pad Thai was different from normal pad Thai, but it was still good."}
{"text":"Apathetic service and tables that smell like rancid dish rags are the least of congee queen's worries (York Mills). The hot and sour soup was just a horror--thickened with so much corn starch it was just terrible--and the bean curd dish i tried was just swimming in a watery teriyaki sauce. My friend had a noodle dish w/crab that was nothing but flavorless noodles and nearly no crab. When we told the server that we didn't want to take any of the food home, he didn't seem surprised. Not a good sign."}
{"text":"This was the first of currently, many Congee Queens that was built before more stores came out, now being the Chain Styled Restaurants.  When Congee Queen first opened, it was a real hype - with a long wait time and delicious food.  After this location became successful, there are tons of Congee Queens that opened up across the GTA, that you can get Congee Queen somewhere near you. There's a small space to wait, so be prepared if you see a lot of people near the doors.  When I first came here, I would give this place a four or five star, but after opening up so many restaurants, I'm not sure if the Head Chef moved to a different branch because the food doesn't taste as great as before, and prices have began to rise a little more than usual.  I really enjoy their eel fried rice or salmon fried rice. It comes in a big portion and has small bits and pieces of eel and salmon nestled inside the rice. In addition, we come here for clams - their quality is fairly good and the meat in the clams are large."}
{"text":"LOVE CONGEE QUEEN. Wow, I believe Congee Queen has become a chain restaurant after seeing it become successful with it's first restaurant. Also, it's amazing to know how their food appeals to both the Chinese population as well as other cultures.  I always try to come to Congee Queen early for dinner or late slsh early for lunch cause it's ALWAYS packed. I love the booths at this Congee Queen, it's very spacious and the circular booths make it seem very secluded.   Today, I ate clams with black bean sauce served on a piece of lettuce as an appetize., It was really savoury. A little salty at first, but the clam were juicy and fat, my favourite! We ordered the salmon fried rice, I felt like this was my favourite item on the menu as they mixed in small fish eggs into the rice as well. We ordered half a chicken, which the chicken had no signs of hair on the skin and was SMOOTH, like literally as smooth as a baby's bottom. I only wished they gave more of the onion, ginger and oil sauce. Lastly, we got a dish of green veggies with oyster sauce. It was pretty huge compared to what we expected.   All this came down to $42 including tax, without tip (we had a 10% discount card though)."}
{"text":"Congee Queen looked like a restaurant from Hong Kong when I first stepped in a couple years ago. They went from just one shop to two, as they bought the neighbouring store as well. A ton of people of different cultures like to eat at congee queen, because, well they're pretty delicious for decent prices.  Their food is usually of the same quality and huge portions. I love the salmon or eel fried rice, you're looking at about $13 for the whole plate, but it's LARGE. Their fried turnip cake is seasoned perfectly and cut into cute squares.   Another one of my favourites are the lobster with E fu noodles, the sauce, the lobster, everything is fresh but not too salty, and did I mention HUGE?!   Definitely recommend that you come in and give it a try, but do come early cause spots fill up really early. Literally when I plan to eat here, I come at like 5:45pm for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for takeout and was so appalled at the service we received. The lady at the cash literally never looked up from what she was doing, and we never knew if she was talking to us because not only did she not make eye contact with us but she also would constantly walk away while we attempted to tell her our order.   A little manners would go far!   It's really unfortunate because I actually loved the food, especially the lobster which was cooked to perfection--it was very meaty, easy to crack open, and didn't have that super fishy taste.   I'd try coming back another time but I don't think I could ever dine-in here because the service was just that bad."}
{"text":"Family brought us here since we had no idea and were in Toronto for vacation.  The turnip patties are so awesome and delicious! All the other foods that we ordered were also quite good.  Got a table relatively quick. Service was good."}
{"text":"I go back all the time just for their fried chili turnip cakes. Its better than most places around"}
{"text":"Food is good but the worst delivery service ever.   I live 2 min drive away from here. Ordered food and 1hr 30 mins later it is still not here.   DO NOT ORDER DELIVERY.   You can eat in or do takeout. That's it"}
{"text":"So this is a new location.. close to walmart and outlet stores so it's a good addition to Heartland..  But not let's get down to the restaurant. So I've heard from friends and family that there's a long wait time and is always packed.. my partner and I took the kids here around 4pm and I guess I  can say that this is a good time to go  here cause it was not busy..   The place itself looks very modern and fancy.. the design is very nice we couldn't stop looking at the details.. even their washroom was clean the only thing I would say hi didn't like is that there is only ONE diaper changing table and it is in the handicap washroom so if it was being used by someone who needs that specific washroom you would have to wait there's no other options to change your baby.. which I think they should add one in the MEN and WOMAN washroom..  Food wise was ok not over the top special.. we got CONGEE with crab meat egg white and fish maw.. 2 assorted bbq combo road pig and duck and a crispy Cantonese chow mein.. since in not a fan of duck by itself I can't say anything but I did like the roasted pig skin was crunchy and meat was soft.. the crispy chow mein was good I wish it had more veggies and last congee I was honestly surprised to see real crab meat.. the kids enjoyed it you do have to add soya sauce and hot cause to get any flavor..  As for service took us a while to place our order and even get our bill at then end.. we tried calling a few of the employees but they ignored us and walked away..  Not sure if I would come back again like I said for me the food wasn't special and services wasn't the best"}
{"text":"Took a while for them to come take our order.. staff are friendly they move around quick.. I've noticed all locations are pretty busy and this location is busy as well I guess due to its in a mall.   After our order food came out within 5min..  We ordered the super bowl congee which is good enough for 4- people depending on their appetite it has soft clam crab meat salmon shrimp and scallops..  The other dishes we got was the crispy Cantonese chowmein with assorted meat beef chicken bbq pork crab shrimp squid and few pieced of veggies..   The taste is òk they use alot of MSG in  their dishes though.. I don't know when the best time to come cause it seems they are always busy no matter what time.. and make sure once a server comes to you finish whatever you need to say cause it will take a while before they come back and check in you cause the people that bring the food to the table are in training..  Would I go back to this place yes it is worth the money and fast service.."}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday around 7pm hoping for some great food, as I've heard wonderful things about Congee Queen. It was very busy, but we got seated immediately.  As we were looking through the menu (which is brand new and has lots of pictures )... half an hour went by and no one came to our table to take our order or even greet us.  We got up and left! I haven't given up on Congee Queen, I will definitely be back to try the food and hopefully get some better service next time"}
{"text":"Great food at this place No matter what location you go to  Turnips BBQ Pork Udon Shanghai Noodles  Even the Thai food is decent  Have had both the mango salad and the pad thai is quite yummy  My parents have always ordered their Chinese food since it arrived  We'll definitely keep ordering from here"}
{"text":"I love Congee Queen It's the closest I get to some real Chinese cuisine  The deep fried turnips.... Never ate turnips in my life Tried this and I am hooked  Bbq pork with honey is another fave  Chinese broccoli with garlic is my fav veg  Even the Thai food is decent  Whether it's take out or dining in.....can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Very solid HK style food. I go to Toronto only a few times each year, but I make it a point to come here to dine. Their congee is really good, and their noodle dishes are great. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok to me. The service was strange..they sat us then didn't come back for like 15 minutes. They gave us ice-less water and then left again. The food came out in shifts so no one was eating at the same time. It was ok food. The Pad Thai was a little sour. The congee was basically rice soup and no one liked it."}
{"text":"This place is good for dine-in, take-out, large groups, small groups, and open until very late. Prices are a little expensive, but if you're craving chinese food, this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to places when we head out east. There chili oil is one of the best you can find.  Everything we ordered tasted great as always and the service was excellent.  The only down side to this location right now is the wait time to get a table.  My family lucked out last weekend because there were 6 of us and it only took less than 10 minutes to get a table."}
{"text":"I have two simple tests for congee.   1.  Does it have a good flavor without having to add chili oil or soy sauce.  Most places just cook a giant pot of plain congee and then add the ingredients to order.  The good places spend some extra time cooking the plain congee with the ingredients you chose so that the ingredient flavors are imparted to the plain congee.   2. Is the consistency good and does it stay good.  Poor quality congee turns watery after a little while because it's cooked with starch and other binding agents to \"shortcut\" the slow simmer process  Congee Queen semi fails the first test and passes the second one nicely.  The flavor was a bit bland but it could be because I chose ingredients with subtle flavors (seafood and meatballs).   I think if I would have ordered it with the preserved egg and fried oysters the flavor would have been much better.   The consistency was excellent and stayed so all the way to the end.    Highly recommended and I would suggest getting a congee with preserved egg!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is one of my go-to places for reasonably-priced, good quality Chinese congee, noodles and rice dishes (aka in chinese jook, fun, meen, fan).   Food is always consistent and service is fast if completely transactional.  Favourites include: -Fried turnip cakes: beautifully pan (or deep) fried turnip cakes stir-fried with meat, shrimp and veggies in a lightly spicy sauce.  Tastes so good, but must be so bad.   -Beef brisket/tendon rice noodle in soup.  Generous serving of tasty beef brisket and tendon with wide rice noodles served in a nice beef broth.  Beef is well-seasoned and cooked to the right texture.    Decor is clean and pleasant, but as others have noted, the service is completely meh.  Then again, good service is hard to find as you go north!"}
{"text":"Our go to place out of all the congee Queen's. Service is super quick and attentive. Just be aware of dinner times it gets really busy. Prepare to wait. Can't go wrong with the food, never had any issues with it either. Everything on the menu is shareable I find so don't order too much or you may not finish. Great lunch and breakfast specials... Although I never really get to experience but when I do I enjoy them. So look out for them when you go in during lunch or early morning."}
{"text":"Great place for late night dining. Quick service and food is fast. Sometimes you just want to eat and go. I always order the Iced Lemon Tea OR the HK milk tea. Their congees are good all year, I like the salmon with preserved egg (which is extra). Good selection of roast meat and yummy with rice."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a long time with my family every so often. Our Go-To is definitely the Salmon Congee, Beef Fried Chow-Mein, Turnip Patties and the the Dough Fritter wrapped in Rice Noodle. The service is standard polite and the food usually comes at a quick pace. I love coming for the lunch special because you can get a free drink with each dish you order! Love their Bubble Milk Tea and Red Bean with Vanilla Ice Cream on top. Never really had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Came for Chinese New Year. Um, yes. Chinese New Year. Odd choice. S'okay. The one to please is Grandpa. He quite enjoyed it here last time, so we figured we could get away with it cuz our first choice was fully booked out.  Grandpa's opinion of the night: even better than the last time we came. He went so far as to say that next time, instead of going to one of the fancier Chinese restaurants, we should just come back here. This is highly odd of him. His logic is usually that the more expensive the restaurant, the better it is...not saying he doesn't know food, cuz he totally does.  My new notes:  Roasted pork belly/ribs: They've always had good Chinese BBQ, but this takes the cake. One of the top 5 experiences I've ever had with Roasted pork. Served hot. Perfect ratio of fat to meat to crispy skin. What I mean is that there was just enough fat that the entire piece of meat was just meltingly juicy, but just not enough fat that I wanted to spit out a fat chunk. Ohhhhhh.  Vegetarian six grains fried rice: At $11.50, I thought this was here to rip off non-Chinese people who think they're eating health food. I'm sorry. I'm a horrible person. I truly apologize. We ordered this because my cousin really likes it. He's a banana (Chinese on the outside, white on the inside...not a derogatory thing. A descriptor. I too am a banana, to some extent). I figured I'd try it just cuz it was there. It was oddly Chinese tasting. Actually, it's good enough that I might just replace my regular fried rice orders with this. Various types of fungus in here. Trust me, you won't miss the meat.  Mixed fungus and fried gluten in hot pot: At $13.99, this is a tad pricey, but it too was surprisingly good. My aunt's pick of the night. I'm a huge fan of both fungus and gluten, so this was amazing for me. It was so amazing, in fact, that today, I bought the ingredients to attempt to make this at home. Here's to hoping!  Side note: Even amidst renovations (their sign has yet to go back up), Chinese New year (when Chinese people want to go to fancier restaurants) and lots of snow (made for horrible traffic conditions that night), the restaurant had quite the lineup by 7pm. Make reservations!"}
{"text":"I'm going to note one dish. The fried oysters with belachan sauce ($18.99) is one of the more expensive items on Congee Queen's fairly extensive menu, and it's one I won't regularly be choosing, but I was fairly pleased with the portion we received for that price. Our dish came with 10 decently sized oysters. That equates to about $2 an oyster. I'm actually okay with that price. I can justify the $18.99.  Downside to this particular location. We parked on the side where their front door is. My grandmother is in a wheelchair. We couldn't find the accessible ramp (or parking) anywhere near their front door. My brother ended up giving up and just lifting her wheelchair past the curb."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! I don't have a single complaint. The restaurant is gorgeously decorated, the staff are very friendly and quick. The portions are huge and they come very quickly, no having to wait half an hour for your dish. All of the dishes are very reasonably priced, we ended up taking about half of what we ordered home because the portions were just too big."}
{"text":"The food is amazing by far, definitely would come back again theres so many dishes to try. And pricing wise theyre fairly cheap. Love it, the service is good, the food has so much flavor its unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for dinner on Tuesday around 6.30 p.m. but didn't get the order until close to 8pm!! And my house is just 10mins away from the highway 7 location. Service is ridiculously slow and the delivery guy is still asking for tips... I will never order again."}
{"text":"decent food.  I hav read the good reviews online, so with high expectation, I put it on my taste list on this Toronto road trip from London. Honestly, it didn't meet my high expectation... We ordered the HK typhoon lobster, which is no.1 chef's recommendation, I felt it tasted so weird (although can't say it's not good). It is definitely not the traditional dish, however my bf liked it. Congee was very good, pork liver cooked to the right texture."}
{"text":"One thing I appreciate about this joint is that it's consistent. Their BBQ is one of the better ones in the area, and the restaurant is large enough that we've rarely had to wait for a table. Extensive menu, and decent prices and  service. Just don't order the pad thai."}
{"text":"Final verdict:  After a second visit, I am avoiding this place, even though I enjoy the food hear.  I first gave them a 5 star, and now I dropped to 2 star because even though their food is tasty, they really abuse MSG.  They douse their food with MSG.  I feel the MSG almost 48 hours from when I had their food.  My throat is itchy, my mouth is dry, and have a headache.  I get why restaurants sometimes put little bit of msg to flavor their food, but this place really abuse their food and customers with MSG.   So despite their good price, and tasty food, I will not be coming back for more. ========================================= BAD:  long wait time  Good:  Food quality is A Service B Price is A  We ordered the combo sea food congee.  It was very clean tasting and tasty.   I felt the ingredients were fresh and the overall dish was clean and flavorful.  We also ordered seafood chowmein.  It was lacking in seafood, but the noodle was cooked to perfection - crispy but not burnt.  The vege and the seafood in the seafood chowmein was very fresh and tasty.   We had some some of Chinese desert with red bean, tapioca, and black jello.  It was out of this world.  It was not too sweet but tasty.  I have had this rendition in other restaurants and they were way too sweet and overdone with sugar and syrup but this place did it just right.     Overall verdict:  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Mississauga.  I hate their wait time as there is always a long line.  Next time we plan to come between 2-4pm or 11am when the open to avoid the crazy line and insane waiting time.  But the wait was worth it.    I am definitely a fan.  I will be back.  I checked out other tables and what others ordered looked so good that I am definitely tempted to go back in next few days.  BB"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is one of my favourite restaurants in all of Richmond Hill. They have great prices, adequate service, many menu items, delicious food, and even helps you split the bill between your friends. The only thing is that the food quality is not always that consistent, and sometimes, it is not as good as previous visits.   1. Food (5/5)  THE FOOD IS SO AWESOME! Everything is good, I actually can't really critique anything wrong with it. Please please please try the salt and pepper calamari, its actually so heavenly. Other good dishes that I would recommend are the XO sauce stir fried turnip cake and the seafood congee with Chinese donuts.   2. Service (4/5)  Service is always great. They attend to you right when you enter the place and make sure you are seated in a comfortable seat (away from the windy front doors). If you need to split the bill, ask the servers and they will do that for all of you. They can even charge everyone separately on their own credit cards. Since this place is so busy sometimes (during dinner), it might be a bit hard to grab their attention.   Overall (5/5)  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ALL FAMILY AND FRIENDS!!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is a fairly standard Chinese restaurant -- I love that it has a very strong franchise and the different locations are generally quite consistent. The menus are the same and the dishes are generally prepared in the same way. My favourite dishes to order here include the radish cakes, the curry fried noodles, and the purple rice/coconut milk dessert.   The wait time can be 10-20 minutes on a weekend evening but the staff are very efficient at clearing and seating tables. The waiting area at this particular location is a bit tight and it can be difficult to find a place to stand where you're not in the way of everyone.   Would definitely recommend Congee Queen if you are at a loss for where to dine and looking for some classic dishes (read: Chinese comfort food). The demographic consists most frequently of families with three generations. It also provides a very Chinese atmosphere -- sometimes, it can be hard to communicate with the waiters in English -- and definitely has the bustling environment that is definitive of this class of restaurant."}
{"text":"I did it. I lost it.  No  more dirty shame, and nights spent awake thinking about ways for me to lose my congee virginity.  Now I hold my head up high, puff my chest out, for I am now a man. A man who is one with the Congee.   I came here yesterday for the first time due to many suggestions by you beautiful yelpers! We UYE'd it :)  The place was packed, but thank golly gee I made a reservation!  After pouring through the menu tirelessly, and wanting to order everything, I asked Sara KP to \"just figure it out!\"  If it was up to me, I would've ended up ordering the \"Internal Delicacy\" and \"Blood Jello\".   We ended up ordering:  1. House Super Bowl Congee with the Deep Fried Bread: It was delicious!! HUGE pieces of Shrimp, Crab, Surf Clams, Salmon, Garoupa and other stuff. Great flavour from the Green Onion. I LOVED IT. Maybe next time I'll add chili to it as well.   2. The Salt N Pepper Squid : DELICIOUS. Was super hot n super fresh, so obvi i burnt my tongue eating it. Still delicious.   3. The Spicy Pork Chop : OH EM GEE. Beautiful. I can't describe my love for this. Thanks to Johnny H for suggesting this!!   4. The Turnip Patties: Wow. Deep Fried bites of amazement with Shrimp, Egg and Chicken. Think homefries but a bit sweeter and waaaaaaaay softer. Love it!    Unlike most people who had a horrible time losing their virginity, losing my congee virginity was the best decision I ever did make. I'm glad I'll always remember the yummy food and only be filled with happiness and tummy rumblings....not shame and regret like other things.."}
{"text":"Um....I had the weirdest chinese dish; perhaps this place is a bit too traditional for me.  I did not enjoy the dish very much.  I got the beef with ginger lo mein and it was very bland.  Neither the noodle or beef had any flavour (no salt, soya or any thing). I tried dipping the noodles and beef into the soup but it was still meh.  I asked the waiter if it's supposed to be like that and he couldn't explain.  I've been to congee King/Queen in scarborough and it was delicious there and this place had tons of ppl so I'm sure there is reason for it but I just didn't enjoy my food."}
{"text":"There's something about Congee Queen that makes me lose my mind. As in, I completely forget about propriety and stuff my face until I have to be rolled out of there lest I burst right there in the restaurant out of fullness.  It's their fault for serving food that's so goddamned tasty.   First, the House Super Bowl Congee is the bomb. I'm usually a chicken congee kind of gal, but the House Super Bowl has changed my mind. The seafood in the bowl is always tender and never fishy. My next favorite dish is the Seafood and mixed vegetable Taiwanese vermicelli. I'm drooling just thinking of the tender shrimp and noodles, with bits of scrambled egg. The portions are gigantic, but we order family style and over-order so that we can have delicious leftovers the next morning.  Luckily, the food here is served fast -- it's the waiting around for a table that can be a bear. This location is less crowded than the one in Thornhill, so you'll have less of a wait, but it'll still be at least 15 minutes for a table. Use that time to think about all the delicious congee you'll practically pour down your gullet. Yum."}
{"text":"We usually drove all the way to the Congee Queen in Hwy 7 & Leslie and we like it there.  This new one is closer to us so we gave it a try.  It was not the same, food here was not as good and we found it more expensive than other noodle and congee place.  We didn't notice it being expensive in Markham maybe because we always dined with a group before and we shared the costs.  Last time we went as a family of 4 and noticed the difference.    They are always busy.  I would not wait over 40 minutes to eat there.  Their food were not that good to worth the wait.  We were forewarned and went in before the dinner crowd on a weekday.  Even then, we were seated in the section by the entrance (looks like a make-shift section) and the tables there were crabby and the chairs uncomfortable.  The servery were located there as well and I heard the constant clanking made by the cutlery which was very annoying.  We haven't been back since but I wouldn't say never ever."}
{"text":"Came here 2 times over a span of 3 days. First time with a couple friends and Husband that recommended this place, and the second time just with the Husband.   The first time we arrived was on a Sunday afternoon, and luckily our friends got there before us to grab a number for a table. They warned us that this place is pretty hopping, so it was a good move on their part to arrive early!  Once we arrived, my friends just got the table, so the timing was perfect. We deliberated quite a bit on what to order, but after looking at the tantalizing menu, we decided on the Sliced Fish Congee ($5.25), Crispy Cantonese Chow Mein ($10.25), Fried Bean Curd with Vegetable ($9.50), Fried Chili Turnip Patties ($5.95), and Shrimp Wonton Soup ($4.75). For 4 people, this was PLENTY OF FOOD. Of the above mentioned dishes, the standout ones were definitely the chow mein, congee, and the turnip patties. The wonton were decent, but they were just pure shrimp. I was expecting it to be a mixture of shrimp and pork, but the size was a just right. The chow mein had the right amount of crisp and bounce to it without being too soggy from the sauce. I loved that the sauce was not a clear corn starchy mess like many places I have visited before. It was flavorful, light, and had a little hoisin in it. Not too much, just enough. The variety of seafood was plentiful, and didn't overpower the amount of noodles. I liked the turnip patties as well because they were not over starchy and oily. Too many times are these delicate beauties overdone, and way too salty and oily. I really liked Congee Queen's result, and with the added spice, a real winner. The congee had a nice base, but it would have been awesome had there been more ginger slices mixed in with it. The tofu was a very generous portion and had a nice sauce, but just a tad too oily. Flavor was spot on though.  Decor is nice with a modern and contemporary minimal feel to it. The dark wooden slats that flank each booth table complement the neutral light wooden panels that serve as the main color throughout the restaurant. It's light and airy, and the there's a nice flow to the restaurant layout.  Service is pretty efficient and prompt, and they also don't rush you out of there, even though there are a lot of people waiting for a table. The only downfall is that since this is a hopping place, it tends to get loud, but I think it's definitely worth coming back, and I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Congee Queen several years back from a friend of mine, and at the time, the only one I had been to was their flagship in Thornhill. So during a recent trip, to my surprise, when I saw another location open up close to our hotel, I was super ecstatic! This place is one of my favorites to come for Cantonese style comfort food.  It opened a few months ago, and the space is right next door to Go For Tea. When you walk in, the space is much bigger than the Thornhill location. The decor is very swanky and modern; a far departure from Thornhill. I didn't mind it at all, but it was definitely more glitzy than what I expected.  We sat at a half booth table, and since we were starving, ordered quite a few dishes. We went with our favorite Fish Fillet congee, Singapore style fried radish cakes, Beef rice noodle roll, Shrimp wonton soup, and stir-fry garlic green bean sprouts. Everything was delicious, but the shrimp wonton was lacking from what we're used to, and the broth was salty. The quantity was generous at 8 pieces in a bowl, so one person could easily get full off of it.  Our favorites of the night stood out because they were balanced and flavorful. The congee was smooth and had thin slivers of ginger mixed throughout. We would have liked more. The pieces of tilapia fish were moist, flaky, and generous in portion. At $5.50, it was a total bargain. The beef rice noodle roll was nicely executed, and the noodle portion was thin enough to balance the thickness of the beef scallion filling. So good. :) Radish cakes were light and crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Portion was huge, so we took the leftovers and ate it the next day. Let me just say that they taste just as good cold, as hot! To balance out the starch and protein, we had some stir-fry garlic green bean sprouts, and they were crisp tender and super garlicky...just how we like them. I'd imagine that if you had a meeting afterwards, you might want to tell them to tone the garlic down a bit, but otherwise, it's good just as is! A little greasy, but we've seen worse.  Wait staff was pleasant and friendly. We didn't have much problem trying to get a staff member's attention, compared to what we've had to deal with at the Thornhill location. I hope they keep up with the standard of service and quality of food because I'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I'm actually a big fan of this place, even though it was my first time going there (I know.. am I even FROM the GTA?!) It was late, I was sick and I wasn't feeling up to par to cook something.  My boyfriend was reluctant to go here with me because he told me he visited it during his high school days (over 10 years ago... wow, oldie!) and he said it was \"ratchet and disgusting\" But after we walked in, apparently they did a whole new reno because it looked pretty good to me! It was clean, and the workers were attentive. They came right away and they were quick bringing out everything. None of them were rude (though I've heard of accounts of this here), they were actually really smiley and happy even though it was late.  We ordered pork & preserved egg congee (fave!!) and some turnip patties (Don't like them, but he does), dough fritters and a mango pudding at the end. It was all very good, and not TOO salty. Yum Yum! Only $21 for the entire thing.   I'm down for congee queen again!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food that's, overall, delicious. Since we came as a party of 14 on a Saturday of a long weekend, I figured it would be busy and made a reservation the day before. Although I even confirmed our reservation a couple hours before we arrived, when we got there (the place was packed - people waiting were crowded at the front), they seemed to have lost our reservation and we had to wait about 30 minutes for tables. Minus the unfortunate mishap with our reservation, the food was good and service was quick especially considering how full the restaurant was, but sometimes, understandably, we had to flag down a waiter if we needed something. Overall, this place deserves 3.5 stars.   We ordered different dishes - a few of our faves were: Yeung Chow fried rice with shrimp & bbq pork ($10.25) - you can't go wrong with this classic rice dish; sweet and sour pork ($9.50) - sweet and slightly fruity, all of us enjoyed this one; stir-fried beef with chili black bean sauce  ($12.25) - good taste, well-cooked, above average.  We also ordered their house pad thai with shrimp & chicken ($12.50) which was all right - for me, I would have liked a bit more sauce with it and the flavour wasn't as bold as I like. Our order of spice and pepper salt squid ($9.50) was cooked well but too salty and their general tao chicken ($12.75) wasn't as flavourful as I've had at other restaurants. We ordered their house seafood & mixed vegetables fried Taiwanese vermicelli ($12.95) which I really enjoyed - it reminded me of the Yeung Chow fried rice we ordered but in vermicelli form - it's a definite recommend for those who prefer noodles over rice.   I'd recommend this location of Congee Queen - the food quality is consistent, service is quick, and the prices are relatively good for the amount of food you receive."}
{"text":"It is absolutely embarrassing how this is my first visit to congee queen in markham. It's also a bit embarassing how much I LOVE it. From the outside, it's not super impressive, just looks like a plain ol' chinese restaurant. The inside though.. WOAH! It's HUGE with decorative wooden interior and it looks super new and clean. Instant fan. Although there were a lot of people, there's also a lot of tables available and they're not understaffed, THANK GOODNESS. The service was super fast and friendly. Another thing I found was that their english is pretty up to par. Then I realized it was because half the people that eat here are not chinese.   I love the food and the prices for them. The century egg and pork congee will forever be my favourite.. it's not too salty and mmm, just right. Love.   Not much to say other than.. yay for all things! Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Have gone here frequently with family and friends since their opening in the West end.   Been going to different locations in markham and north York for years.   Line ups are still normal anytime you go!  Their turnip cakes are signature and no meal is had without an order our 2.  Large menu with good range of food to include vegetarians as well as meat eaters. Their bbq is one my mom trusts!  Their gluten and mushroom pot is delicious and a recommendation.   Congee... its in their name is an obvious order. No unsalted grandmas congee here ;)  Come prepared to wait and you won't be disappointed. The decor and chandeliers are nice to look at while you wait!"}
{"text":"Yet another visit to another congee queen over the holidays. I have an issue with the one at promenade and in Mississauga so I definitely enjoy going to one when I'm close by.   Quick turnip patties and Cantonese chow mein hit the spot after the spa across the street.   Quick service, not overly friendly but not rude either.   Food is good...not healthy but good lol I'd rather one of my Mississauga gems (Chi's/Macy's) for congee than here but lots of good HK style choices to choose from ;)  Solid!"}
{"text":"This is the ultimate place to have Chinese food. Honestly, it is really good. As a Chinese born girl who eats Chinese food every day of her life and has grown up with home cooked food, this place is the best! Even the rest of my fickle family likes this place.   The soya sauce chicken is ultimate! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. The look is more modern and is 'English friendly'. Many of the clients are of other cultures and they seem perfectly as ease ordering and communicating with the wait staff.   The dish that I simply cannot live without ordering when I go is the Shanghai Noodles. The way they cook it is amazing and it's just so good. Other staples are the sticky rice and the pot rice, seriously don't ask me what the names are in English cuz I couldn't tell you.  The owner/chef used to work for Congee Wong but broke off on his own and opened this restaurant. He is the mastermind behind the success of Congee Wong and has now gone out on his own and is more successful with the Congee Queen franchise.  This place is great for cheap, authentic Chinese food. You will also find other Asian inspired dishes such as Pad Thai but stick with the real Chinese stuff and you'll be safe."}
{"text":"The place can be packed on a Friday night so do make a reservation if you do go.  This particular restaurant has more seating than the other ones.   We celebrated a birthday here and ordered 9 dishes.  Overall, the food was more oily than usual.  I felt a bit sick afferwards because of how salty and oily it was.  I have been here a few times but this particular time it was just satisfactory."}
{"text":"Ambience & Decor: Contemporary Service: Service is matter of fact but good. Sometimes difficult to communicate in English with all my he wait staff & have to ask for someoywgo speaks English.  Food: Good but this is the last time I'm going to Congee Queen.  After visiting a couple of their locations & repeatedly checking ingredients - (since many Chinese food items tend to have fish & other seafood paste mixed into sauces, soups & congees), for their congee, we had been told that 1 or 2 congees on their menu are vegetarian. We have ordered these congees before. Yesterday the maitre d'hotel or manger told us that all their congees have SCALLOPS!!!!!!!!! We had taken vegetarian guests there stating that they will like the congee!!!! When we told him about having eaten the congees in the past after confirming there were no ground animals, he had nothing to say. I was ready to leave the restaurant but we were a big group & ended up staying as this manager assured us that the items we were going to order had no animals! We have also been told in the past that their hot sauce has shrimp paste but yesterday the waiter told us that it DOESN'T!! Is anything safe to eat on the menu? Hopefully the watered down, flavorless tea which is served is made with water & not chicken broth (I'm afraid to ask). I guess this place doesn't care about what they serve their customers since it is busy & most people are not vegetarian. LAST & FINAL visit to Congee Queen  - a vegetarian unfriendly place."}
{"text":"Congee Queen's is the new King of Congee restaurants in Mississauga! How's that for a confusing opening statement?  I spotted this restaurant opening near the already busy Heartland area, beside the highly acclaimed Seafood City. We went for New Years' Eve, along with what seemed to be the rest of the Filipino and Chinese community in Mississauga. Wait time was surprisingly fast given the amount of tables ahead of us, we ended up waiting about 15 minutes to get a table for 5.  I immediately noticed that the items here were pricier than your standard fare, which was kind of expected, given the higher class feel the restaurant provided.  Our family settled for an order of Softshell fried rice ($15.25), Salt and Pepper Squid ($11.50), House Super Bowl Congee ($15.99, consists of several types of seasfood), Stir Fried HK style Lobster ($28.99) and a chicken lettuce wrap (can't find the price).  The food came in quick time, which again was a surprise given how busy it was. Further, the food was definitely fresh, and not re-warmed like other places might've done.  The food in itself was great. All of the items were well seasoned, and extremely tasty. The squid stood on top of all the rest, with how light and crispy it was, while packing a strong salty and pepper punch.  The lettuce roll came in a close second; a surprisingly delicious plate with a good amount of meat on it.  The Hoisin sauce brought it to another level.  Congee was good, had decent amounts of seafood in it, though I felt the congee itself had a bit too much ginger to my liking.  The Lobster didn't meet expectations, unfortunately. Felt like it was a little bland (though the only other time I've had this dish was a a restaurant that specialized in just that, and may have skewed my benchmark). For the price we paid, it was underwhelming.  All in all, I was extremely satisfied with the experience. Service was attentive, atmosphere was pleasant, food was timely.  Would definitely come again...maybe when Seafood city has quieted down next door."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I love Congee Queen don't get me wrong. I'm from Markham and having been to this Congee Queen three times now, it doesn't quite stack up compared to the other restaurants. And it's also quite pricey and busy so you are better off going to any other Cantonese restaurant in Mississauga.   I tried many things on the menu and there's a certain difference in quality and subtle differences in the food here compared to the Markham location (but to be fair I haven't been to the Markham ones in a couple of months so I'm not entirely sure if it's a chain or franchise issue here).   The Cantonese chow mein noodles were a bit thinner than the usual and was mostly all crispy and lacked the non crispy parts. I also found there wasn't enough gravy/sauce as well. The wonton dumplings despite saying leeks in there, didn't have any. The turnip cakes were rather pale and almost uncooked like in texture and in colour.   But otherwise the food is still mostly good. These are just things that deviate from the quality I come to expect from congee Queen. The prices are definitely on the pricier side too. If you're coming with a small party, there will definitely be leftovers, so pack it up!   It's worth noting that this place is absolutely packed as well and you should be prepared to wait a while for your seat."}
{"text":"Congee queen is one of my favourite places to eat fantastic Southern/Cantonese style Chinese food. I have been coming to congee queen for as long as I can remember and the food here never fails to disappoint.   I believe this Congee Queen location is one of the bigger ones, there is plenty of space and you don't have to wait too long to get a table, even at peak times.  I have been ordering the same things for years and years now and this time was no different. We came here for an early lunch and ordered a small congee, Cantonese chow mein, and the fried dough fritter rice roll. Just a heads up, a small congee will serve 8 bowls.. so save the large or superbowl for a big party. The congee is always great here and is a must-order. I have to say I really enjoyed the combination of mussels, mustard greens, and duck egg yolks in the congee. Their Cantonese chow mein, a personal favourite of mine, features a healthy amount of proteins and toppings. The fried donut rice roll was okay but one of the rolls were refried.   The food always arrives piping hot and fresh and quickly to boot. I also really recommend the turnip patties, the fried squid, and of course the fried rice.  Service is always efficient with no problems whatsoever. Good job congee queen!"}
{"text":"Love the food . very nice place . The restaurant is clean and tidy. The only thing was the last 2 times the order was slow to come in . for sure recommended this place."}
{"text":"This Congee Queen located just across the street from my house!  This restaurant is a typical Congee Queen shop with wide range of food selections. They even have pho and Thai dishes. Lots of parking cuz it's right at the Agincourt Mall.  The staff are inexperienced but I had no problem with the service. Usually I give well detailed for my orders. No one tries to avoid you or prevent eye contact like some congee shops. Hehe.  Food Quality: Good Service: Very Good Price: Reasonable Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"This place is always so busy! They serve great food which a lot of different dishes on their menu! The prices are decent and worth it in my opinion. The dishes are good size and always so good!"}
{"text":"Great quality dimsum items and good prices!  I tried some of their congee, as well as dimsum items and they came quickly, and were hot.   The fried dough wrapped in rice noodle roll, one of my favourite items, was made well here as the dough was crispy and the sauce was on the side.  Overall good value, but my favourite place for Chinese dishes/dimsum all day is still House of Gourmet."}
{"text":"So far the best Chinese food place for me. This is what I tried:  1. Soft Shell Crab Fried Rice........10/10 2. Fried chili turnip patties ........10/10 3. Tiger Shrimp Skewers........9/10 4. Deep Fried Wonton.........10/10  Soft shell crab fried rice was a pleasant surprise even though the amount of crab was not that great. I loved the fried chilli turnip patties the most. I was a bit skeptical about that but when I tasted them, it was a fireworks of taste and texture in my mouth. The outside was crisp like hash brown but the inside was soft like mashed potatoes.   Their service is really fast even though not that friendly, which I do not care about at a chinese restaurant. I can live with that when the food is this much tasty. I will comeback again for sure and write some more...."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is the top Cantonese chain in the GTA right now and a must try. Price points are higher than other places but the food is good and always consistent. Rice, noodles, congee and BBQ are all good. They also have a lot of non-traditional and Chinese-fusion dishes which you should try."}
{"text":"Congee Queen was our go-to place during the 2016 summer when friends overseas came to visit. I feel like anything you order will be served quite fast and will taste delicious.   However one instance last December... a small cockroach sneaked in the water pot and came out to one of our cups, boiling and resting in peace.   My conclusion - the dirtier the kitchen, the better tasting the food. Food server apologized and replaced our hot water. Y"}
{"text":"When in Markham and in need of CHINESE cuisine, this is the place to be. Taste is close to other branches. It is like the Mcdonalds of cantonese cuisine. Everything we order is real yummy. Yang chow and eel rice are kid's fave. Taiwanese Vermicelli is bland but with the Chili sauce then it becomes a WOW. Half order of duck also tastes very authentic. Quick service. Book in advance if going during rush hour."}
{"text":"We have been to this location previous times.  However today, (11 March 2018) it was quite busy, and the service staff was not quite as attentive.  We had about a 7 or 8 minute wait to get a table, and then (since I prefer a booth) we were seated at a table next to others.  The pork congee didn't taste as appetizing as our previous visits.  Even when I paid the bill, left a generous tip, the waiter just took it and never said a word."}
{"text":"When I say I go to Markham for the food, I'm usually thinking of Congee Queen!  All my fave sinful cravings under one roof!  Location Close to Markville, along Highway 7, east of McCowan. Large dining space that is always full!  Modern and fairly clean decor and area.  Private dining room available, which also doubles as a \"family room\" -- where they stick groups with young kids (that's us...)  Service We didn't make reservations, but were seated quite promptly despite being busy.  Turnover is quick, service is quick.    Food Seriously, I can skip the above 2 criteria and go straight to this and hand over the 5.  You know why you're here:  +++ crunchy, crispy turnip cakes +++ house special seafood congee +++ wonton soup ++ salt and pepper squid ++ seafood chow mein +++ golden milk pudding  This is a family favorite, and will continue to be a must-do when we're visiting relatives in TDot.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Your typical Chinese restaurant where you'd come with your family. The service was quick, and food was quite decent for the price. Would highly recommend the pan fried turnip cakes"}
{"text":"The best in HK style cafe food. Consistently top notch and fast service. Not too far from downtown. You must try the salt and pepper fried squid. Unbelievable. Great for lunch at time."}
{"text":"Last night, at dusk, we were in the mood for a terrace in the neighbourhood. We knew that Montana's on Steele's had one, but were bemoaning that no Chinese restaurants had any. And lo' and behold, as we drove by the Congee Queen (where we had eaten a couple of times before), there was a terrace.  This was a very popular place on Saturday night, with a very long wait...but no wait for the terrace. Although it fronts on Steele's they have landscaped in such a way as to create a nice quiet space.  We were not overly hungry, it was more about enjoying dusk outside. For starters we ordered the appetizer Stuffed Eggplants. They were awesome! Beautifully prepared with a nice firm yet spongy middle layer of stuffing. This was following by a Fungus and 6 grain Congee, that apparently has many health benefits. This is not the usual enormous congee, but it was just right.  As a main course we shared the Seafood with Noodles, and had the vermicelli changed to broader flat noodles (like the ones in Shanghai noodles). It was delicate and delicious.  They have a broad extensive menu, with many pan-asian specialties. I had previously had a great Pho' there, and they have very tasty succulent duck and duck dishes. They also have an extensive take-out menu.  The restaurant is very new and very elegant, not pretentious, just nice! EVERY SINGLE employee that we came across on our way out addressed us, was pleasant and thanked us. This was almost worth the extra star to 5star.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Congee Queen it was a catered luncheon for a family event. I LOVED it! I'm usually skeptical about trying new Chinese places as I have my \"go to\" places when a craving hits.   Here are a few items we tried:  Fried rice noodles with sliced beef & soya sauce - noodles were fresh and not overcooked, beef was so tender and seasoned so well. There were also some bean sprouts added to the dish. Overall one of my favorites!  Vegetable fried rice - not mushy or a lot of soya sauce. Tasted fresh and had a good amount of vegetables  Fried Sweet & Sour Pork - good portions of pork, not over battered, sauce was flavourful while not being overly sweet.  BBQ Pork w/Honey - sooooo delicious - no other words to describe this heavenly dish!  Vegetable Spring Rolls - crispy, not oily, good amount of vegetables - what's not to love!  We have also had delivery to our house. They are always busy, but deliver on time and the food is always fresh and never cold! There are a bunch of other dishes we have also tried (shrimp won ton soup, general tao chicken etc.) Food is consistently fresh, served hot and never greasy. I would love to go there for dine in, but anytime I call, it's REALLY loud & noisy in there. I have 2 small kids, so it's not for me. We stick to take out & delivery."}
{"text":"Good, inexpensive Chinese food.  But you need someone that knows what to order.  Very confusing menu."}
{"text":"Super busy even though we went on a Monday night. Be prepared to wait unless willing to share a table. Staff are friendly and efficient if not overwhelmed. The food, well exactly like the Lawrence and Don Mills location, great. This is now on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the person who wrote: - Cheap, big portions, good portions, fast service (not very talkative) and fairly clean.   Excellent Congee at an even better price point.  Totally the perfect place to go on those cold days when you are in the Markham area and finished a day of shopping and need to relax, eat something warm, filling and substantial that won't break the bank.  Portions are substantial so go with a bit of an appetite.  This is real deal Congee so you won't be disappointed if you are a congee lover.  However, there are other items on the menu that are just as good and still at a very good price-point also.  Not somewhere you would choose to hang and meet friends....more a place to go after a day of shopping with your hubby or wife and grab a quick bite at a good price and get going on with the day of chores and running around.  Busy place but never really a problem getting seated.  However, not the kind of place you will feel comfortable lingering and hanging out in...more like: Seated, Look at Menu, Order food, Get food, Eat and leave.  All without wasting cash and without wasting time."}
{"text":"Congee is my comfort food and this place doesn't disappoint!  They have a large variety of different congees, but in addition their menu is huge.  Everything we have tried so far was delicious.  Price was also typical for a Chinese restaurant.  Service isn't bad, but since they are so busy you gotta be proactive to flag down a waiter.    One downside is that there is always a huge line and wait.   We reserved a table ahead of time. However when we got there they said they don't take reservations......????  They did however try to accommodate and they gave us the next 2 tables (as they didn't have a large enough table to fit our large group)."}
{"text":"We happened to land here when looking for a relatively late (around 10pm) option in the area. A wide open and almost cavernous space which boasts multiple large circular tables at its corners greets us. The round tables taps in to a special need for greater family style seating in more mainstream restaurants in the GTA. Even at this late hour, the Congee Queen was packed.  Lovely, complimentary tea was brought immediately and was refilled.   In the tradition of ordering and sharing in the 'Family Style' tradition, the six us us share an amazing bowl of Wonton Soup, a rich broth with a perfectly seasoned wonton with a delicate shrimp inside. Next we opt for an old favorite of General Tso's chicken. The chicken maintains its moisture, reflecting a fact of  an expert fry and and serves with an actually higher protein to broccoli ratio. The other dishes similarily were generous in portion sizes.   The service was efficient, non intrusive and attentive concurrently. Even after a likely long and cruelly shift, the servers appeared to sustain a high level of energy. One was observed to favour a possible hamstring sprain from being on the feet all day.   Overall, before tip was $80 for 6 of us. For value good quality and service, especially at a late hour, a great experience and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is our first trip to the Commerce Valley Drive East location, as we went to the Congee Queen at Steeles and the 404 several months back. It is part of a large block of resto's, including options as Spanish, Japanese, Bombay Biel and others. Congee Queen here is tucked in the back, but that certainly doesn't stop the massive crowds which flood the place. We arrived a little after five, but by the time we left it was packed.   Upon arrival in a cozy booth, we were presented with a nice pot of tea. The menus are quite extensive, and the two of us decided on a small Tiger Shrimp Congee to share, spring rolls, and steamed rice. Our waitperson, Connie, helped us device between the half Soya Sauce Chicken or General Tso's. Now, we always have General Tso's, and wanted to try something different. When Connie looked at us, she wasn't sure if we would like the half Soya chicken, but we ordered it and very glad we did!  A large portion of well seasoned chicken, sliced and paired with some flavoured beans. With some hot oil, and combined with the steamed rice, it made for a pretty delicious flavour profile. The Congee was served hot with large tiger shrimp, scallions and was more than enough for two people.   Now, the service was hit and miss, but that's part of the fun. The folks there where nice and accommodating, and was a good experience. With a beer, glass of house wine and tip, the total for all was about $50.00, which was pretty good value. Definately a good time!"}
{"text":"Great place for home-style Chinese \"comfort\" food.  Service and quality is always consistent and is a always a place where you are never disappointed.    Must Try /great go-to menu -  Chili Turnip Cake -  Fred Squid -  Cantonese Chow Mien -  Fish Congee -  Fried Sweet Cruller  Only issue sometimes is that parking can be hard to find, but there is a reason for that! (food is great!)"}
{"text":"although attending to our needs was a bit slow, the food came quick and was very delicious. Of course we HAD to order the fried rice noodles with beef (& xo sauce - a CLASSIC. My go-to, regardless of how extremely oily it is), fried turnips (which are sooooo good. HIGHLY recommend. Fried on the outside, yet soft and moist on the inside. They're like hashbrowns, but a loot less dry and flavourless), and bbq pork on rice (the rice serving was actually too much, but the pork was pretty good)."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to's for Chinese food in Toronto, I quite like their crispy beef and their general tao chicken. Well located, just a block over from Shops at Don Mills. They're generally very quick for takeout, not so much for dine-in (not a concern if you're not rushed)."}
{"text":"We have been to the one on Sheppard in Scarborough,and everything there was good. This location was so disappointing that I don't even want to go Congee Queen anymore.  1. Got our order wrong (The waiter even confirmed with us before placing the order. We wanted to try something new so we ordered the congee we have never had before. We realized that the server got the wrong order after a couple bites of it.) We called whoever was near us to ask if this is the congee we ordered. This guy (not our waiter) didn't even apologize. Just rudly took away the bowl and came back with our congee without saying a word. We were very polite about the whole thing too.  2. Ordered calamari (had a chili sign on the menu which is supposed to be spicy) there was no chili whatsoever. We asked the waiter if this is the right order. He said \"yeah it is. They are underneath the squid.\" hmm Excuse me, there was none. I only found a small piece of fish fillet which threw me off. At that point, we didnt even bother to complain. Calamari was way too salty too.  3. Turnip patties were too sweet. Felt like i was having dessert. I had the same dish at diffrent location and clearly this is now how I remember.  Overall, nope, just no. I don't know how this place has four stars. Maybe we were just unlucky tonight."}
{"text":"Big Chinese food chain! This place is a safe bet if you are not familiar with Chinese food yet you want to give it a try. They accept credit (yes, unlike most Chinese places), better decor, good service.   I don't know how authentic the food here is, but I have nothing to complain. Thier turnip patties though. Both of my thumbs are high up for this dish! Crispy on the outside and fluffy and smooth on the inside, the right amount of seasoning and spice to them! I insisted on ordering congee just because the place is called Congee Queen (like my logic? haha). Got preserved eggs and pork congee (classic) very good and flavourful. Also got this fried noodles (don't remember the name because my boyfriend ordered it) which was also good. Generous portions (took leftovers to go). Reasonable price   Overall, I mean if you are lazy to look for good Chinese restaurants, give this one a try! There are multiple locations throughout uptown."}
{"text":"Very good cantonese food that is right near my hood. Their noodles are very good, never tried their congee though."}
{"text":"Same as the other locations, fast service,great stir fry turnip cake and salt & pepper squid. Great late night hangout. Big bowl chiu chow congee is the best!"}
{"text":"Newly opened where the Brix used to be, and next door to Go For Tea, Congee Queen is likely to be a new favourite for me.  Outside of the wide ranging menu filled with beauty photos of various dishes, I ordered from the Lunch menu, which is a half dozen dishes in the \"under $10\" camp.  I had the Yeuong Chow Fried Rice, which comes shaped like a pyramid filled with great morsels of shrimp.  It comes with the Shredded Chicken and Corn Soup, but I ordered a small side of Shrimp Wonton Soup as a test.  The soup was as good as any I have tasted.  Overall, the place is fairly packed, and the staff was unusually helpful and friendly in spite of the busy lunch crowd.  This is a place for a good business lunch, more elegant than most restaurants in Richmond Hill.  Based on the main menu, I feel a distinct need to return to try some of the other dishes.  The fried rice was excellent, but there is so much more to conquer.  Charge!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good portions at this location.  Friendly staff.  No true worries with parking.  I'd go back if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"After a previous bad experience here a few years ago, I am giving a better rating for this place because I have since gone back and have experienced better.  The place gets busy.  Even during a Thursday evening.  Service is fast and the food is piping hot and tasty.  Even though our server made a mistake with our order (Provided us with \"ho fun\" flat rice noodles as opposed to the requested chow mein), it was rectified within a short period of time."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never wrote a review about the place before but the fact it's always busy tells me that most people already know about it.  Just remember E3..The Cantonese chow mein. That's my go to dish with some hot sauce on the side.  Enough for two people. Dinner for $20 including tax and tip. If you read all the reviews there's a lot more amazing dishes on the menu.  Now only if they would open a location in Mississauga"}
{"text":"Soul cantonese food at its best. Affordable prices, superb selection of the classic congees, lo meins, noodle soups. Their \"cha leung\" (fried dough sticks wrapped with rice noodles), beef tendon lo mein, wonton noodle soup, and fried calamari were delicious. The eel fried rice was their sleeper dish though!"}
{"text":"This Congee Queen is the best, fast service, good take out, work very efficient. Food always tastes good and big portion. If you dine in there, you can eat there, then take out the left over for next meal. Its awesome. BBQ duck is a must try there. Price is a little bit pricy in terms of chinese dishes, but its huge portion and taste amazing. Great for family of 4.  MUST GO!!!"}
{"text":"Alright somebody give these guys more stars because I bet if congee queen shuttered their business, we'd have a riot in the GTA.   If you're reading this review, chances are you are not Chinese because you would've been here multiple times already and don't need me to tell you what to eat lol.  So let's start with the menu and must haves. When visiting I always go with one appetizer, a fried rice, fried noodle and bbq dish. The appetizer, hands down, is always the deep fried turnip parties. It's crispy on the outside, soft and light on the inside, and is wok fried with egg, chilies and shrimp. Rice is usually soft shell crab and noodles will be the crispy Cantonese chow mien, a crowd pleaser for most people. Let's get to the main event,bbq. The BBQ pork is sweet and crispy on the outside and just tender on the inside, like the girl you had a crush on in grade school. I salivate, however, thinking about the roast pork. It's got this crispy texture like a chicharron and just melts with flavour.. Be sure to ask for extra hoisin sauce for dipping and rib cuts for more flavour and tenderness, which may cost a dollar more but we'll worth it.   It may not be authentic but damn is the general tao chicken good here! It's got the perfect crispy texture and sauced up for you to enjoy many times over."}
{"text":"I've been to several congee queens and I always love love love their dishes. However, this was my first time visiting this location and I was surprised to find and the food quality was below standard. Half of the dishes I ordered tasted bland and had a kind of rotten smell to it. Service was prompt but the servers looked like they were miserable. Will definetley continue going to the other locations instead."}
{"text":"The temperature is 18+ degrees Celsius, and are you looking for some excellent and tasty Chinese portions for a decent price while sitting at an outdoor patio? Well, this place is not a bad option. I finally got a chance to eat at this place after driving by it so many times during my trips to Toronto. This place is supposedly the \"flagship store\" of the multiple locations of this chain and one of the most popular places to get some \"juk\" or congee in the Greater Toronto Area. There's usually a lot of people that come here on Saturday afternoon for lunch.   One cool thing about this place was that there's an outdoor patio to sit outside when the temperature is greater than 18 degrees Celsius. We got a chance to eat at this section of this place, so we can avoid waiting longer for a table inside.   The Wong Hau Dai Juk, which is the House Super Bowl Congee (A2) is a good dish, has excellent portions enough for 3+people, and it is filled with a variety of seafood. Although it was great, I thought the texture was a little too watery. At $10.45, it is not a bad deal.  If there were two things I am going to miss about this place, it's probably the flavours of the XO Geung Gon Chao Ngau Ho, and the Wong Tai Ji Man Yu Chao Fan. These dishes are the Fried Rice Noodle with Sliced Beef and XO Sauce (E11) and the Empress Fried Rice (CQ22, with eel, fish and crab meat). I really liked the spices of the noodle dish, the sesame seeds, and the texture of the thin noodles. Beef was fairly tender. The fried rice had an excellent flavour from the eel. Yes, it is more expensive than the other fried rice dishes, but worth the extra money. Portions are excellent.   As for the other dishes, the Yeung Chau Chao Fan, also known as the Yeung Chow Fried Rice (H15), was decently good and the portions were also excellent, but it lacked flavour compared to the Empress Fried Rice. The Crispy Cantonese Chow Mein (E14) is not a bad choice if you want a simple noodle dish with a lot of seafood and vegetables. The noodles had a decent crispiness and the portions are also excellent.   The quality of service is not great, so if you are looking for a quick lunch under 45 minutes long, this may not be a great choice. It's more like a place in which you are not in a hurry. All dishes should be enough to feed at least 2+ people or enough to take home leftovers. The patio is nice, but the scenery is a little boring.   Overall, I thought I had some of the best fried rice and noodle dishes in Thornhill so far. I would definitely come back for the noodle and fried rice dishes and I think it's worth spending the extra few dollars on the Empress Fried Rice dish, especially if you are with a few people. I also would not mind coming back if I really want to eat some fried rice and noodle dishes on a nice patio."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family, and I had an enjoyable experience. The inside of the restaurant had a very modern design, and I was really impressed when I first walked in. The food was great overall. The dish that really stood out to me was the fried chili turnip patties.. I could eat those all day. They were crispy on the outside and packed with flavor. The texture was perfect. I also really enjoyed the crispy cantonese chow mein. The noodles were a little bit thicker than what I'm used to, but I thought it was still good. I ate the noodles with their homemade chili oil, and it was an awesome combination. Their chili oil is seriously amazing. It isn't as spicy as your average chili oil, but its flavor is one of the best I've tried to this date. I was immediately hooked after trying it, and I actually bought a large jar of their chili oil to bring back to the states because it was that good! The bowl of congee we received was massive. The flavor of the congee was decent, but I was put off from eating it after trying a clam that turned out to be a little sandy. The dough sticks were pretty good, but I've had better.   The service seemed to be a little on the slow side even though the place wasn't packed or anything. The prices were about reasonable. I would gladly come here again the next time I'm in the area to hopefully try more of their menu."}
{"text":"As a native of Scarborough, I've been to quite a few Chinese Restaurants.   My husband, kids, and I met my parents here. They've been regulars here for a few months now.   The menu is vast, but for non-Chinese speakers like me, I'm thankful for the photos and English descriptions. There were so many choices, it was almost difficult to choose, but as this is my 2nd time here (ordering different things each time), I can tell you, that you can't go wrong...all choices were yummy!   The service was super fast, served by efficient and friendly staff. The ambiance was great for a family with 2 small kids: a little on the busy/loud side, but hey,  I think we all know that those are the Chinese Restaurants with the best food at the best prices.   The Coconut Milk Cake dessert? Wow. The creamiest I've ever tasted. If you are a meat-eater, I recommend the Mango Sirloin on a Sizzling Plate...(do I need to say more about that?)   Agincourt Mall is a small one, but if you have to run a few errands then grab a bite to eat, this is probably a great place for you to visit if you are ever in Toronto's East end."}
{"text":"The roasted pig was excellent!  The skin was crispy and the meat was well seasoned.  We also had the shrimp wonton soup which came with 8 hugh wontons.  This dish needs to be shared with 4 people so everyone get's 2 wontons each.  The six grain congee is also very tasty.  I would eat here often if I lived nearby."}
{"text":"omg, my group of friends and I ordered a brunch of food for delivery. First, when the ordered was delivery, the order was wrong. The guy gave us another person pick up order and we had to wait another 15-20 mins for him to come back again. finally he came and everything was right.  I ordered the thai mango shrimp salad. The shrimp is alright, but the salad is just way to small..there's not even half of the mango I think, only like 20 small slice of it? and they charged it for $10.99?? Did they ever order a mango salad in anywhere before? I will pay $3 for it maybe! the size is ridiculous, it can probably finish in 3 bites?   Think they should make some improvement on this. The other orders are fine."}
{"text":"One of the best congee restaurants around. The interior has a modern feel to it, feeling fresh and innovated. Service is usually quick, but without feeling rushed. And the food is always consistant for all the times I have visited.  Fried Singapore Turnip Cake is a definite must-order. There is a crunchy texture on the outside, with a savoury and soft interior. It has a slight kick to and it is ever so addicting. It usually goes great with your rice or congee dishes.   The also feature specials, along with their usual menu. Comparitvely to other congee restaurants, Congee Queen would be on the pricier side, but is it worth it? YES! If you have always disliked eating congee or never tried, this place would make you think twice. It is light and has flavour, and great for sharing around the table.  They also have a BBQ section where you could order from a variety of BBQ and roasted meat options to-go."}
{"text":"Congee Queen has grown to be a successful and popular franchise over the year and has expanded to this location in Markham. They offer dishes from the usual congee, noodles, soup, rice, but also with a Thai / Viet flare into the menu. There are many, many items to choose from, which always brings me back to try something new.   I have been here numerous times and it'll probably be a top choice for a random night outing with friends. Food has been consistently good, though it has been on the pricey side for the specials they offer. Limited lunch special options as well.   You can also purchase fresh BBQ/roasted pork, soya chicken, duck etc, from the restaurant. Though on the pricier side, I find it delicious. Not too fat and not too lean.  Usual orders:  Fried Chili Turnip Patties - Tasty turnip cubes with a kick to it. Tasty and great for sharing. Goes great with an order of congee.   Seafood Super Bowl Congee - Comes with salmon, crab meat, scallop, squid, shrimp, and sliced fish. Many people dislike the bland taste of congee, but the congee here is savoury smooth and full of ingredients.  Seafood Chow Mein - Always a fan favourite. The seafood and sauce coats over a crispy bottom layer chow mein. It tastes great when the chow mein is half crispy and half coated with sauce.  House Seafood & Mixed Vegetable Fried Taiwanese Vermicelli  - Has shrimp, mini scallop, egg and vegetables. Light and easy on the oil. Comes in a generous portion.  Great for group outings as the dishes come in generous portions for sharing. Atmosphere is lively, but not too rowdy.   Note: It can get quite busy on weekends and holidays, so be sure to make reservations."}
{"text":"First time at this location tonight, ate at the Markham location happily for years. The Good News: The food was really good. Great to see the consistent quality control. Wait staff run off their feet. This is a big restaurant. Our server never lost his cool, food came within a reasonable time as did the bill when we asked. These guys deserve a good tip. The Bad News: It's not like there is a shortage of Chinese restaurants in Mississauga, but this place jammed! The hostess and hostessing function was bad. Not really. It was a catastrophe! Some guy with a party of 14 and a reservation at 6pm was waiting when we got to get our number. He was seated after 7pm. There were at least 50 people jammed into the waiting area. When we left after 8pm there were just as many, and most didn't seem happy. It was impossible to hear the hostess' voice when she called numbers. Two large groups were given the same number. The hostess was running ragged. The manager seemed over his head as well. Needless to say they both scored 1 out of 10 for customer friendliness. Once we were seated, everything was OK. For us. No Stars for Organization. 3.5 Stars for the food. 4 Stars for the Wait Staff."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunday night and didn't expect it to be SOOO busy!! I always pass by this location and it is always packed at dinner time. Luckily I only had to wait 15 minutes to get a table. We ordered yeung chow fan and some clay pot dishes advertised on the specials menu. Our food came within 15 minutes which was surprising considering how busy it was! The fried rice came out warm instead of steaming hot which was a little disappointing, but it was still really tasty. The best thing about the fried rice is that it wasn't really oily compared to how other restaurants make it. The clay pot dishes of course came out sizzling and it was delicious! Seeing the other dishes on other people's tables also looked really good.   The service here is really good considering how busy it was. The waiters were really fast with our requests like getting napkins, more tea, etc (and they were young and handsome LOL). The food is a little bit on the pricey side but I guess it was worth it. The inside of the restaurant is really clean and modern looking.   I'm not sure if I would come back here again because it's a little pricey and I can definitely find other places that serve similar dishes, but I'm glad I tried it out because I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Came here some weeks ago to have dinner with Cris! It was my first time coming to a congee queen location. Located near Shops on Don Mills, there's plenty of parking available. Inside, the ambiance is clean, open concept with plenty of seating. Food we had their seafood congee, which I found had a bit too much corn starch for my liking.  Vegetarian Cantonese noodles was average. Chili turnip cakes with shrimps and chili probably my favorite thing to have anytime of the day! Overall food experience was.....okay. The service was slow for a weekday, it took forever to get the bill."}
{"text":"Food, service, and price really aren't that impressive at all.  Not sure what all the hype is about, but there's usually a line-up on Friday/weekend nights...  Their food quality is mediocre, tends to be on the salty and fatty side, and almost always comes out a bit too oily.  Their service is pretty non-existent, and their tea is honestly horrible, lukewarm.    The price is really what sinks their boat, for such a mediocre restaurant, their price really isn't competitive and is on the high end for such simple dishes.   You're better off trying some of the restaurants nearby in the plaza, than going here."}
{"text":"I come here with family a lot, solely because they are good at accommodating groups (without a reservation) with a decent wait time, and have generous portions for low prices! My favorites are the pepper salt squid, fried turnip patties, Cantonese chow mein and seafood congee. Also, if you have to wait, it's right next to Shops at Don Mills so you can take a stroll before coming back."}
{"text":"You must try their Singaporean Stir Fried Turnip Cake!!!! It's insanely delish!! Also, their Singaporean Vermacelli, their Yeung Chow Fried Rice, their beef Ho Phun.... well, any of their noodles and fried rice are awesome.  oh, but don't try their Thai dishes..... it's not their forte.  But then what were you thinking? it's CONGEE Queen, a HK style cafe!!  :P"}
{"text":"Love the selection and the food.  Always have the deep fried spicy squid.  Group of 10 ate for $80 so reasonably priced.  Try to come at non standard eating times as the wait can be very long."}
{"text":"Was really impressed by this place.  Got there after a squash game with a buddy during that dreaded gap between lunch and dinner when many restaurants are closed, but not Congee Queen.  We were soon seated with a copy of that extremely extensive menu (if you want choice, this is the place) in our sweaty hands.  The two of us ordered the crispy cantonese chow mein, fried chili turnip patties, spice & pepper salt squid, and the dish behind the house super bowl congee in the picture (can't remember what it was called).  We were ravenous, having played intense squash games for an hour, and ate to our heart's content -- and still had a ton of food left over.  My friend commented that this might be the best Chinese food he's *ever* had, and I was inclined to agree with him.  Not sure if it was the combination of the dishes we ordered (the turnip patties were phenomenal) or the great value ($36 for the whole meal incl. tip, which could've fed 4-5 people easy), but we left very satisfied customers."}
{"text":"I come here quite often and didn't even realize that I didn't write a review for them.  How can that be justified..  Anyways, this congee queen has been here for years, longer than I can actually remember...the big spacious restaurant is comfortable with alot of booths and decent tables for groups....  Always thought in my mind that all Congee Queens TASTED the same but nope, I was wrong...I like this location more....in terms of TASTE....   Service is extremely fast, we ordered and food literally came out within 5 mins of ordering... Wow....tastes has been the same every time I come, no complaints and pricing is reasonable in this day and age....   Congee is soft and yummy with adequate ingredients, not overdone or under....just perfect in my standards...  Fried vermicelli is also yummy not too oily and good portion...  A place where I don't need to start getting concerned about quality and quantity...   4 stars *** well deserved"}
{"text":"For me the best Chinese food place in Toronto. Not something high end, just a regular Chinese restaurant, but food quality and taste are fantastic. I visited this place couple of times - quality and service were always consistent. Among the dishes, so far my personal favourites are any type of Congees (some kind of broth or porridge made from rice) with their house made Chilli Oil (mix the Chilli Oil if you like it spicy)  and Fried Chilli Turnip Patties. Also everything else I tried tasted very fresh and delicious. Most importantly the quality was always consistent.    The portions are really big. One small Congee is good enough for two persons. Best to visit in a bigger group, at least four, in that way you can try more items. Also foods are usually served very quickly after the order is placed - surprisingly quickly considering the number of customers they need to handle at a given time. Also foods are served very hot (temperature hot) - so be careful before you bite. In other places they will usually tell you if food is served very hot. Here they don't. Just ding - put it in front of you. There you go, give a bite and drink the cold water until you can cool down. I almost burnt my tongue while eating the turnips. Oops!   There are decent amount of free parkings in-front of the restaurant and also you can park in other near by places inside the Shops at Don Mills. On the weekends, it gets very busy - in extreme cases you may need to wait 30 to 45 minutes to get a table.  Service is good - not like the server will come to your table couple of times to ask how is everything, but if you ask for something they will respond quickly. Most customers are Chinese, at least the couple of times I visited that's what I saw, so you may feel a little bit out of the place if you don't speak Chinese but much better than other similar places I visited. Items are written in both Chinese and English in the menu. There are also pictures and explanation in English in some cases - so you don't have to guess."}
{"text":"Visited largely by the local Chinese population, this relatively new restaurant is a fabulous place for small or big groups to dine at an affordable price. I suspect the larger the group, the better value you'll get, as this is a family-style restaurant with lots of shared dishes. This place has several locations already, and opened this one not long ago. The interior is modern and spacious, although somewhat tired looking already possibly due to the popularity and heavy traffic in this restaurant. Overall, the ambience is casual and suitable for children, but can be busy so expect a wait during peak hours.  Food-wise, the scope and quality is outstanding. We had a vast array of vegetarian and meat dishes, spanning the spectrum of Canadian-pseudo Chinese (e.g. Lemon Chicken) to full on Chinese (mixed vegetarian tempeh with mushrooms). Quick service, and good hot food that arrived promptly despite a busy service.   We stuffed our faces with over 14 dishes, and paid less than $20 a person. Would most definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best congee I've ever had! We had the fish and beef one and the rice was so creamy, silky, delicious !!! I thought they were popular for congee but a lot of people came for noodle and rice!  And did I mention it's unbelievably cheap? We had a congee for 7$ tax included, shared it between two people and it was a fulfilling but at the same time, light late night meal!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is open on almost every single holiday so if you don't have any food in your fridge on Christmas or labor day or thanksgiving, they will be open. I really like the food here. It's not exactly the most healthiest chinese food out there but it tastes really good. Their chow mein is nice and crunchy and whatever side you get with it tastes really good.  I'm a big fan of their turnips. These come out in a cube like shape and taste really really good. My brother actually loves it and it's on his list of things to get whenever he goes there. The fried rice is flavored really well. I guess their main speciality is the congee which isn't too bad. My parents usually get a couple of these and my grandmother loves the mincee congee."}
{"text":"Quick service, large portions, tasty dishes (MSG) and cheap prices! You can't lose!. I always order seafood and bean curd soup, BBQ pork rice noodle rolls, Cantonese chow mein, rice noodle with beef and black bean sauce with vegetables and spicy fries squid.  You should go with more than 2 people to eat.  Too bad there are no congee queens or congee wons in the downtown Toronto area."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  My parents love going to this place.  A lot.  I like that 3 people can eat well, for about $30.  The service is questionable, but mostly, they are very quick.  I like the fried turnip patties, and of course the dim sum dishes are delish too.  We try to try new things all the time.  Try to get here early, the line ups can be crazy."}
{"text":"This place is ok.  It's well-priced and we were starving.   I like the rice rolls.  I ordered the wonton noodles.  My bf ordered some kind of spicy beef dish.  They were all tasty.   The food comes surprisingly fast, which is kind of amazing.  To be honest it's kind of amazing to me how a chinese food restaurant can bring your food before other restaurants even start making your food.  Alarming.?  Probably.  Tasty and convenient?  More definitely.  This is a pretty busy location, but the lines are shorter than their other locations."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is always packed no matter what time...lol Thankfully the wait time isnt too bad. We have been there 4 times since it was open and so far we've had waited max 15-20 mins for a table for 2.   I absolutely love the eel fries rice I get it every single time. The portions are pretty good for almost all dishes. Love chicken from BBQ section..we definitely enjoy the food.   However, I recommend not ordering desserts from there. Its def overpriced and the portions are so little. I ordered sago coconut milk which was $4.25/ bowl. It had very little sago in there. You basically just pay for sugar water for $4.25. Coconut milk wasnt strong enough either. I was very disappointed. I flagged down a waitress and complained a little she took my sago coconut milk back to the kitchen and came back with a little more sago in there. I appreciated her effort as you usually dont get this in a chinese restaurant.   Food is amazing; dessert is a no no."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat.  They have both Dim Sum (to order from the menu as an appie)  and family style dishes.  The pictures on the menu are accurate to what the food looks like and it tastes great."}
{"text":"This Congee Queen never disappoints!  Spacious, uncluttered, well air conditioned restaurant with meals that are noticeably a cut above other congee houses.  I always order the same things here:  pork and century egg congee - well seasoned congee and their pork is so tender, like it's been braised for hours.  beef *see choy* hor fun - these noodles are so silky smooth and flavourful, i just can't get enough! Also comes in *black bean* and *waat daan (smooth egg)* varieties, which are both delicious.  BBQ Eel fried rice - if you've never tried this, the bbq eel tastes like the ones you'd get from eel sushi, and the rice is of a perfect firmness level, whereas other places can often serve mushy rice. Just remember to order it like a true fob and call it \"eel fly lice!\"  There is lots of free parking in the plaza, which is also home to Tim Hortons, Food Basics, Shoppers Drug Mart, and a TD bank."}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me will know that I'm a fan of Congee Queen. That out of the way, this new location has pros and cons. Firstly, this is the most beautifully designed Congee Queen I've been to. The interior layout is a huge square and you can tell that the design is a cut above their other locations. However, of course there's a \"however\", I'm sad to say that the food quality here did not meet my expectations. This is something I've never said about any Congee Queen locations.   It is not a terrible restaurant by any stretch of the imagination. It's just my bottom choice out of all their Congee Queen restaurants.  Give it a try and see for yourself. It's a really pretty place to bring a date. There's also lots of free parking in their shared plaza lot."}
{"text":"I will say this is the most popular Chinese restaurant in sauga. We were expecting this chained restaurant to be opened here long time ago.   There is always a line no matter when we come. However, the waiting time is manageable, somewhere between 10 to 20 mins.   There are a variety of food, from Chinese congee, dim sum, stir fried rice and noodles, westernized chinese food to seafood, rice noodle soups and drinks.  The quantity for each dish is plenty and it is always recommended to have a group of people together for sharing. For individual diner, the food is a bit pricey but can be packed for the next day.   I have been here for more than 10 times within this year and will come often after since the taste is good and it looks relatively cleaner and healthier than other food choice."}
{"text":"This has become our go to local place to get chinese.  I hate the mall but I love this place.  The Hong Kong lobster is my favourite.  Authentic Chinese here.  You will see a perfect mix of asians and North Americans.  This is how you know a Chinese restaurant is good.  Their steak dish is amazing.  Good flavours.  I can care less for the Congee soups. They all look like regurgitated Chinese food with noodles and an egg and a splash of bodily fluids.  But that's my opinion."}
{"text":"I heard the Chinese food in Toronto is good, so I came here by a recommendation. It may be because I am from a city in Southern California with a heavy Asian population, but I didn't find the food to be outstandingly delicious. That being said, I definitely fully enjoyed my meal here and would definitely come back! In particular, the best dish I had would be the spicy turnip patties -- nice and soft on the inside, crispy, salty, and sweet on the outside!"}
{"text":"I have went to this place many times and always come back because the other congee places are not on par with this one.  Ordered the CQ5 - King Mushroom and Assorted Fungus on Braised Spinach Thick Noodle.  First impression is it seemed small for an $11 dish.  This dish eats like Italian Pasta as they sprinkle some grated cheese on top.  The mushroom and sauce tasted well together and the noodle has the right amount of softness. Also had the Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll. It's a 'roll' of the dice with this one and I got an old Dough Fritter which I guess had been drying in the air for a long time and has hardened -1 for this. The other -1 has to do with service. I had to call the wait staff 3 times to finally get my bill.  What do I have to do to get them to take my money??"}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese resto chain has finally arrived in Mississauga! Great service, super tasty food and awesome decor.  Best dishes to order: spicy salty squid, sweet and sour pork/chicken and hot pot rice.  Beware of long lineups, especially on weekends starting on Friday night! Expect to wait about 30-45 min for a table around dinner time, but the service is quick and food arrives within 10-15 min of ordering."}
{"text":"Christmas Day dinner before going to see Star Wars, the Last Jedi. Called ahead to make reservations and when we showed up, it took all of 10 seconds to get seated, even thought the place was pretty full. Started with the house super bowl Gongee, which had large tiger shrimps and delicious salmon. The chicken and bbq pork fried rice was delicious and complimented the fired tiger shrimp and chicken with mango dish. Service was top rate and we shall return soon!"}
{"text":"After paying respects to the deceased, it is a tradition that my relatives and I gathered to have lunch at Congee Queen. Our meal consisted of Fried Dough, Fried Sweet Dough, Seafood Congee, Shrimp and Black Fungus Soup Dumplings, Ying Yang Rice, Chow Fun, and Stir Fried Vermicelli Noodles.  You Tiao is a long golden-brown deep-fried strip of dough, commonly served with either soybean milk or congee. Fried Sweet Dough is a golden-brown deep-fried elliptical shaped dough. I liked how the Fried Dough ('You Tiao') and Fried Sweet Dough ('ngau lei sou') were chewy with a soft interior and a crunchy exterior.  The Seafood Congee consisted of boiling hot flavorful rice porridge with surfer clam, shrimp, scallop, salmon, and white fish.   The Shrimp and Black Fungus Soup Dumplings ('Shui Jiao') consisted of wonton wrapper filled with shrimp and black fungus) cooked in a salty but tasty chicken stock.  The Ying Yang Rice consisted of ying (tomato, egg, and chicken sauce) and yang (shrimp, peas, and egg white sauce) over rice.   The Chow Fun consisted of hor fun (wide rice noodles) stir fried with beef, onions, bean sprouts, and soy sauce.  The Stir Fried Vermicelli Noodles consisted of vermicelli noodles stir fried with shrimp, eggs, onions, and bell peppers. I highly recommend this noodle dish."}
{"text":"At around 7 on New Year's Eve, waited 40minutes at the door, 20 minutes at the table for food. There are some new dishes at this new location. Interior is beautiful, ceiling unnecessarily lofty, creative design, most of all, the benefit of coming to a new restaurant is it's super clean !!"}
{"text":"I hope this is just a coincidence! We took our kid to dine here twice, and she vomited both times and happened when we were still eating. And we still tipped 20% because we fell sorry the servers had to clean that up for us. But it made me curious what they added into the food now."}
{"text":"From the moment we entered the door we already had rude attitudes towards us   When we were ready to order the waiter started to walk away when we weren't even done ordering our food and drinks  We then asked for napkins and the server handed us 2 napkins for 8 people to share   All the people there were super rude and not caring about the customers at all  Food was not good at all   The only thing that was good was the pork congee despite the meat being a little salty  We never come back to this place ever again  People are rude towards everybody including kids"}
{"text":"Congee Queen has several locations in Toronto. We came to the one in Agincourt Mall in Scarborough, Toronto. We were on the way to a friend's wedding and was craving some Chinese food.   Congee Queen is nicely renovated. It is big and roomy inside and the service is prompt. We ordered two congee and half dish of steamed Kai Lan (Chinese Brocolli).   We wondered why the waitress looked at us a little funny when we decided to add another bowl of congee. Initially we only ordered the preserved century egg congee. But quickly remembered, that we forgot to order the pork bone congee.  The reason why the waitress gave us a funny look was probably because we had noobs/tourist written all over our faces?  The congee was massive when it arrived! It would probably be a struggle for us to finish one bowl of congee plus the veggies! Let alone two giant bowls of congee.  In the end, we left more unfinished. Honestly, we felt really bad wasting food. But there was also no point in keeping leftovers hot boxed in the car all day!   Verdict: $5 for a giant bowl of congee is a great deal. But we did feel rather thirsty afterwards."}
{"text":"Comfortable Chinese food and fancy restaurant. My friend and I visited there around 2 pm after shopping. It was not too busy and waiters can cover all the tables.   We two girls ordered a regular size portion of Tingzai Congee, mango salad and fried chilli turnip cake. All the dishes were so tasty. The congee tasted very smooth and yummy because it cooked with roasted bbq duck and seafood. Salad was fresh and sweet although it didn't use the green mango to make an authentic thai food. Fried turnip cake was the best, lightly hot and not as greasy as other restaurants.  We cannot have them all and package the turnip cake to go. The staff just served as normal and the price was reasonable too. I still want to try their dim sum and bbq pork."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for dinner on a Saturday evening. At first, I thought we were going for dinner way too early (we left the house at 5PM!), but when we arrived at the restaurant, all the tables were already seated and we had to wait for about 30 minutes for a table. It wasn't my first time there, so shame on me for thinking I could get so lucky!  As with many Chinese restaurants, we ordered a lot of different food where we shared among everybody. The notable thing here (and my favourite) is the shrimp rice roll. The outer layer of the rice roll is nice and thin, which I like and the soya sauce is great. Overall, the food is great (as usual when I go there).  We had some leftovers that we wanted to bring home, and when they brought the take-out boxes to the table, they actually put the food in it for us! Other Chinese restaurants usually just leave the box on the table for you to do the work yourself.  If they keep doing what they're doing, I'm going to be coming back."}
{"text":"This isn't very authentic or genuine Chinese. I felt like eating processed Chinese food. Their Congee isn't anything to write home about as it tastes the same anywhere else I've had it, but just with a 4 dollar premium. The decor is very well designed as its hipster Hong Kong modern with all it's neat lighting fixture and tables. But food is what it really comes down to.  It's typical for Chinese Restaurants to have MSG nowadays, but I've never had beef and mushroom tasted that enriched in my life before.  The service was very rushed - probably because they were busy. I honestly can't judge if they rude or not - they're just wasn't any interaction or enough staff. They need to really work on efficiency though, as it took them 15 mins to get a bowl of rice and another 15 minutes to refill our pot of tea.  I think this place is franchise and not family run which would be sad because it would explain why the quality isn't as consistent to it's other locations. The price is higher than normal most likely because of the decor and hipster feel of the place.  Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for real Chinese Food and if you'd prefer not to drink gallons of water when you get home with a dry throat."}
{"text":"Well what can I say? It's Congee Queen. They've become an institution fit for all diners alike. They've got a menu that can satisfy any craving. Their success is in their approach-ability.  The space is somewhat clean, family friendly and even suitable for non-Chinese speaking folks. Though, I wouldn't recommend asking too many complicated questions in English. Anyhow, the menus are great with lots of proper English and most of the ingredients are listed. This is run of the mill Chinese food but for a slightly premium price. To the folks who don't frequent Chinese restaurants it wouldn't seem expensive but if you do, you will understand what I mean.  The food is solid for the most part. Flavours are decent and quality is standard. No raving reviews here but no huge disappointments either. So go ahead and order whatever you like that know that it's authentic and probably tastes pretty good.  Are there better? Yes, tons! Are there any better that's more convenient, with decent service and is somewhat adept in English...probably not. Definitely a go-to Chinese restaurant for the masses."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT review: Take out portions are small, and they've seemed to take some items off the menu which is a shame. Food is cooked inconsistently. Sometimes its pretty good, sometimes not so much. I do appreciate their \"free delivery\", but on a $35 bill (gave the guy a $50 bill) the guy was asking me \"how much money do you want back? Remember the bill only covers food and tax, no tip..\". What is that? Give the customer their money back, and then if they decide to tip (which of course I was going to), then they tip, if not then, unfortunately it happens. But they way this guy was coming off was that he basically wanted to walk away with $15.   Much better local take out Chinese food in the neighborhood, with better service."}
{"text":"My family frequents many of the Congee Queen locations quite often, however it was our first time at this particular one. The food is usually consistent at most, the centrepoint mall, and Kennedy/Sheppard location I find the best out of them all.   We came on a Sunday evening and upon arrival, the store was bustling with diners with a huge line outside. This location is smaller than the others, and definitely felt more cramped and was quite noisy. The Congee was thin, and was very bland compared to other locations. The Congee and the Chili Turnip Patties are usually our way of judging consistency as it is a standard item we order at any location and this location definitely did not live up to the standards as it was mushy, and barely had any chili's. The servers were friendly, but it was hard to get their attention but that's understandable considering how busy it was."}
{"text":"This is one of their busier locations and even on a Sunday night at 10:30, it was still packed. The food here is pretty standard along with their other locations. I find this particular location is a little bit heavy on the msg, compared to the others.   We got the Liver and Beef Ball Congee, which was loaded with ginger (my favourite) and pieces of over cooked liver. We also got the Chili Turnip Patties, which are not as good here, as they skimp out on the shrimp, egg and chili's. Their Beef Tendon and Brisket Lo-Mein was okay, (always get extra sauce on the side) but was a little dry and chewy for our liking. The service here is not the greatest, but they're always so busy. It also can get quite loud in here, especially because it's small and cramped. I still prefer the Centrepoint location more."}
{"text":"Awesome family friendly restaurant. I have been enjoying their food since the day they have opened a few years ago. Other locations they have, and that are equally great are on Steeles & Don Mills, and Lawrence & Dufferin."}
{"text":"Went in on a weekday night a bit after the dinner peak hours, and was served food quickly (under 5 minutes). I ordered seafood congee and vermicelli, and both tasted great. The menu overall is similar to another restaurant Congee Wong, but the food quality here is a little better - I would definitely recommend going to Congee Queen."}
{"text":"Great Food for a Great Price! Favourites are: Chili Turnip Cake with Chicken & Shrimp Fish Slice Congee Fukien Fried Rice Salted Fried Squid..too many!! Very affordable place to dine at!"}
{"text":"Best congee place in toronto! We had the queen congee and lobster, only 40 bucks to feed two adult. Love it!"}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times ever since they opened... sadly, it feels like the quality of their food has been declining over the years as their prices have gone up."}
{"text":"Really spacious location; went for dinner at around 6:30pm and was seated promptly.  I think this is the most spacious of the ones I've been to (Don Mills/Steeles, Kennedy/Sheppard), so that was a big plus.  Food is consistent with the other locations and prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"I absolutely used to love Congee Queen.  Despite the name, we never had congee there as we have never been fans of Congee.  Anyways, the go to favourites were always   Dry seafood garlic fried rice  Steamed Kidney and Liver with green onions  Fried Turnip cake  Spicy and salty fried squid  spareribs and dried fish rice  Because we were regulars, we always got the comp dessert, sago with grass jelly and red beans with condensed milk.  We haven't been to this location in a long time, while the wait staff have changed the manager there is really nice.  I have always preferred this spot to their McCowan and Hwy 7 as it's more spacious, my family prefer the other Hwy 7 because it's close to where we shop.  You can imagine how happy I was when my family said we would come to the steeles resto today.  Even as I called to confirm our reservations, something told me I should have asked if the manager we know was there.  But I tensed up and said, nah, she's probably there...hopefully?  (crossing fingers)  Well it turns out, the place was busy as usual.  And my heart sank when the manager we know wasn't there (no more preferential treatment).  Despite having a reservation, we still had to wait thirty minutes.  Not only that, we were at jepardy of not getting the dessert which is why we like coming here.  Service was absolutely terrible, it was hard flagging down anyone.  It seemed like the servers didn't want to come to our area unless they were bringing a dish.  Not only was service bad, the food was bland.  Dry Seafood Garlic fried rice - tasteless, bland.  The fish roe looked artificial, it wasn't orange as usual.  It was red.    Steamed Kidney and Liver with green onions - overcooked and chewy  Fried turnip cake - bland, tasteless, no spicy kick  and lacking any color.  Looks like the presentation has gone down because it wasn't even a reddish orange, instead, a light brown.  Spicy and salty squid - bland and tasteless again.  They put all the jalepeno and red peppers on one side of the plate and not on top of the squid as before.    House pad thai - too much sauce, mushy and lacking shrimp.  I think we'll stick to Hwy 7 if we decide to go to Congee Queen.    Congee Queen, you used to be really good and now you are like any typical chinese restaurant.  Bad service, tasteless food and uninspiring."}
{"text":"This location is spacious.  We've been here a few times and feel like while the menu is the same at every location, flavours can vary as well as each dish.  Today, we ordered our usual.  Dry seafood fried rice, braised tofu and the fried lobster with garlic and mini fish.  We've ordered it here before and liked it.  But the presentation didn't look the same today.  It looked overcooked and the color was vastly different form the photo from the menu.  The server showed it to the manager, who went to seat a table and then came back to the waiting server.  He came over to our table and we explained that the discoloration (it wasn't a nice healthy red) and the presentation of the dish overall looked lacking.  He hesitantly said he'd make us another one but he couldn't promise that it'd be any different.  We said fine.  Turns out, they just brought us back the same one.  We could tell because one piece was partially eaten and put back, and it was back with the \"new\" dish.  C'mon.    If this was at the Agincourt location, I know Henry wouldn't have let this happen.  Sad to say but this location is easier for us to get to, but we miss the service we get from the manager at Agincourt."}
{"text":"We find that this location has kept the standard for food.  The turnip patties were flavorful and tasty.  The wait took a bit today for our food, usually it rolls out but today it was a bit longer.  Mind you that didn't affect the taste, everything was hot and fresh out of the kitchen.  Service is a bit meh because servers are running around.  We didn't get servers coming by our area that much and I had to flag them down a few times.  Glasses were really dirty and had to be changed.  Aside from that, good meal."}
{"text":"What happened to the large portions?  Prices went up and the portion has gotten smaller.  On a sunday night, there's usually a long wait for dinner.  There wasn't much of a wait and in fact, there were plenty of empty tables.    With all the places in this plaza, there are other options available."}
{"text":"Talk about wow factor.  Love the decor, high ceilings and vibe.  Lots of menu options for dinner.   We ordered a wide range of food selection.   Some light snack item, noodle dishes and main entrees. They were all super fresh, tasty and piping hot.  Our favorites were the steamed rice noodles wrapped cruellers, hon  sue tofu, sweet and sour chicken and cantonese chow mein.  Staff were super attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Speed read: 1) Review only the house special dessert. Coconut cream, red bean, tiny tapioca, grass jelly, and coconut jelly.  2) $12 for a big pot  3) Great Pot for sharing dessert.  Congee queen for dessert..... That's right!  This pot of dessert is great for sharing, and not too sweet.  Usually u can't go wrong with coconut cream tapioca.    I am not sure about the rest of the food....Trust the other yelper.    If u read this far, can u please tell me what food u like most from congee queen ."}
{"text":"Wow! How would you know a Chinese restaurant serves great food? Watch out for the number of Asian people dining there and the number of Asian servers! I had gone shopping at the nearby mall and saw the buzz around this place and decided to eat here. The place serves great Chinese food. The service is incredibly fast..you get your order in less than 10 minutes. The place is packed with young and old individuals celebrating birthdays, baby showers and anniversaries. There is always a wait time of 5-10 minutes for you to get seated but I guess the food is worth the wait. The crab soup is very good - the portions are quite large. I also tried the chicken and shrimp fried which was quite good. The servers are petty attentive though very transactional (not friendly). Overall, a great value for money place. Note: The place is busy on weekdays too. If you are non-Asian, you'll feel out of place but you will love it!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. I've been to a few of the other Congee Queen locations (and a lot of other congee restaurants) and this place is probably the best in terms of food and atmosphere. Other people seemed to think so as well because the place was packed when we got there; we had to wait more than 30 minutes for a table for 4 - slightly annoying, but definitely worked up our appetites! Service in general was quite slow (mostly in getting seated and paying the bill) but to be fair, they were pretty slammed.  We ordered the house super bowl congee, deep fried dough fritter (youtiao), crispy cantonese chow mein, fried chili turnip patties, and crispy tiger shrimp & mango salad. The congee was pretty standard but unlike a lot of Chinese restaurants, they didn't skimp out on the protein and it was packed full of seafood goodness! Everything else was just as good, if not better; the chow mein was super crispy and flavourful without being too oily, and I loved how well the deep fried shrimp paired with the refreshing mango salad. Even the turnip patties - a congee staple - seemed to be better fried and better seasoned than they are at other restaurants.  Great food, good portions, nice & clean interior - what's not to love? Just don't visit during peak hours if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Chinese restaurant in Mississauga, which a large selection of food including congee (shocking), dim sum, noodles and rice, seafood, and barbecue meats.   The restaurant is nicely renovated, and has many tables which means a shorter wait time! Good for both lunch and dinner. My go-to dish is the BBQ pork."}
{"text":"I came on Sunday night at 11pm, they close at 12. We weren't served until around 11:15. The lady came as if she was forced to serve us.  The price for the food is questionable. They give you a large quantity but the quality? That's debatable. My turnips were missing the sweet chilli sauce. I didn't bother telling them as they made us pay 5 minutes after we got our food. It wasn't even 11:30 yet! They messed up our bill and on top of that, the waitress kept peeking at our table to see if we were finished. I get it. They're tired and want to go home, but we're still paying customers. The only reason I didn't give this a lower rating is because of their chicken cream soup! It tasted good and the size was more than enough for our group of 3. Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Food quality is the same as the other locations but the portion sizes on some item's are smaller at this location.  Normally I just order 3 dishes as that's sufficient enough and usually have leftovers. Not this time. Won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is my family's go-to restaurant for congee. The restaurant is spacious with lots of seating and thus I've never had to wait for a table. Service is fast and somewhat friendly for a Chinese restaurant. Some of my favourite dishes are:  Supreme Super Bowl Congee Fried Turnip Chili Patties Spice & Pepper Salt Squid  The portions are quite large so watch out when you're ordering!"}
{"text":"Pretty good seating here!  Not cramp like other older congee queens. Did not have to wait long for seat either. And it was a Sunday night. Surprisingly the place also had quick service. Food came piping hot. I order eel fried rice, salt and pepper squid, xo sauce beef noodle. Food was delicious and met my expectations. I recommend this place if you live in the area like greensborough!"}
{"text":"Food here isn't as good as it used to be. And I've noticed the prices going up a bit too. The portions are still decent but flavour just isn't there anymore. My curry noodles only carried colour and wasn't even spicey at all.  I guess this is an alternative to dim sum but still."}
{"text":"Great restaurant that has turned into a chain. I remember eating late night at the flagship location. This one just doesn't live up to my memories of the original years ago. It has a lot of the same dishes that most others have. Their signature dish would have to be the lobster which is quite a bit better than most other places for asian style lobster. I am more of a fan of steamed plane lobster though. The service is always fast and the food comes out quick. The turnip dish was one of the best I have ever had. The rest of the dishes we got were middle of the road. Overall, I will be back no doubt."}
{"text":"One of the better 'quick' Asian restaurants. I would consider this to me a mid tier Asian restaurant.  Perfect for a good family meal. This place does a few dishes really, really well! They have tons of dishes, so there is something for everyone.  They have good lobster if you are into Asian style lobster. They also have some Thai and Korean dishes here as well.  Expect quick service, hot tea, and good food."}
{"text":"This place has yet to let me down. I hadn't tried the Congee until this month (I realize how stupid this sounds), having previously chosen the sweet corn and crab meat soup....The Congee is served thick, steaming hot and is just so hearty...Damn! This, and the fried Taro dish has me hooked like a meth feind...and all for something ridiculous like $15. :)  Don't expect the royal treatment though, wait staff are not the ones to strike up a convo with."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while. Decided to come here on a weeknight for dinner. Ordered the diced sirloin golden bowl ($17.99), tiger shrimp and mango salad ($16.99) and the dough fritter rice noodle roll ($4.95) for two people. The portion of the two main dishes definitely weren't very big but they tasted good.   The mango salad was refreshing with about 10-12 pieces of large shrimps. The shrimps were lightly battered and drizzled with some sweet creamy mayo sauce. The mango salad tasted good too with hint of cilantro and orange, not liking the orange taste.  The diced sirloin was so tender and sizzling hot without the hot plate. The wonton wrap(?) bowl was a bit stale though. A pleasant surprise ;)  Dough fritter rice roll was standard and filled us up.  Service only for non Chinese and frequent patrons from what I saw."}
{"text":"You won't have to go all the way to Markham to go to a Congee Queen location anymore. Went here for lunch twice and it keeps getting busier and busier as Chinese people spread the news like wildfire. They have a large congee, rice noodle, noodle and rice menu, a nice BBQ meats section, an interesting small Thai section and lunch specials all around. You can ask for a lunch menu where you get a side + rice/noodle, soup, an egg roll and a drink. You can also get a noodle soup special that's similar to place like Deer Garden Signatures where you choose your noodle, two toppings and broth. Dishes are huge so be happy when you get to bring home a second meal.  Decor is very bright and seating is very spacious. There are many large round tables that are definitely for dinner service and a lot of booth tables that cater to the lunch service. Hey you, the person that gets offended when the server asks if you're alright with sharing tables? Don't get offended and thinking you're a lesser customer, it's common for Chinese restaurants to fill up larger tables with strangers. If you want to wait for a private booth go ahead but don't complain that you were offered this option because this place will be busy over the next few months.  The first time around I got the Fried Chili Turnip Patties and BBQ Duck with Thick Vermicelli in Soup. Turnip patties are an all around favourite, this wasn't spicy at all unfortunately BUT if you dip it in the chili sauce that's usually put on your table in a small plastic container, instantly 10x better. Even though the sauce is a bit salty, it's worth it (even hours later as my mouth was still dry). The noodle soup was huge and the duck was on a side dish, with about 6 pieces and a side of plum sauce. My only complaint was that they gave me a neck piece which usually is a throwaway or \"specialty\" piece. I didn't come for the bones.   Second time I had Cold HK-Style Milk Tea and Fried Rice Noodle with Shrimp & Scrambled Egg Sauce. My milk tea was a bit sweet for me but probably good for the normal population of humans. My favourite rice noodle dish was a very large dish, with tons of shrimp and covered in the glistening goodness of scrambled egg sauce. No complaints about that one.   Servers were very nice and quick. Yes they speak English. You know the service is better when they help scoop your leftovers in your takeout box. Overall good experience! Since it's so close to me I'm sure I'll be back especially to try their dinner service."}
{"text":"Can mere words describe my experience, Hardly, but I will try. Having sampled the various BBQ, Dim Sum, Dumpling and Noodle houses of Toronto, we find ourselves in the Markham area on our way to the Pacific Mall. While other congee restaurants were good, they were similar to others in the New York and Philadelphia Chinatowns. Experience has it that restaurants outside of a Chinese community are usually not very good, but this very well change my whole perception. We ordered a half duck, multigrain and beef congees, a fried fritter, salt and pepper squid, and pork chops. This variety of soups and entrees usually is my barometer of how well the various tastes and textures will be presented.   The congee was truly a delicious mix of perfect flavor and texture. The flavour was consistent and sweet without being overly salty. The fried dough was perfect in its usual role, dipped in the congee and munched on between delectable spoonfuls of the soup. The beef in the congee was tender and flavorful, while the multigrain truly tasted very healthy. When the squid was brought out, all we could do was stare at the mound of the large lightly fried pieces of squid. Usually at other places these pieces are relatively small, this was a truly pleasant surprise. Equally amazing were the pork chops which smelled heavenly and taste equally the same. The highlight of our meal was the duck. I have tasted duck from New York to Hong Kong in many forms from roasted to Peking. My number one choice is at King Tin in San Francisco, which is my benchmark for each time I try a new place for roasted duck. I have always found that good duck, the right mix of crispy skin, juicy meat, succulent flavor, spices and au jus, makes the perfect combination. I believe I have found a duck worthy of being second. The duck was warm, had crispy skin, meaty, and juicy covered by au jus, flanked by plates of dipping sauce and a scoop of soy beans just like those found in Hong Kong. Its fragrance was reminiscent of the spices, used to coat the inside of the duck while roasting, of that found in the Kin Tin duck. (Please see my review on Kin Tin in San Francisco) It was truly an amazing find. In addition to the food, the ambiance and décor was atypical of a Chinese restaurant. The service, though, was below par, which I attribute to its busy nature and the rush to get food out in order to get more people in the door and at the tables. Even with this service, we will be going back for meals and eating our way through the menu. An exceptional find."}
{"text":"Luxurious Chinese food restaurant!!!!! Nice decoration and good service! Waiters are hospitable and friendly and kind! It's really worthy to go ! And now it has discount of about 10% off!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is a Chinese/fusion restaurant that serves average food with decent quality. After traveling long to this restaurant, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the restaurant failed to impress and disappointed me. When walking in, the restaurant feels welcoming and with a clean atmosphere. The decor has a modern taste with Asian styles into it. This makes the restaurant look elegant and a fine dining experience. The service is always friendly with the waiters/waitresses always ready to take an order. However, the food was not as elegant as the decor and was very inconsistent. We ordered the House Pad Thai, Seafood Congee, Fried Turnip Cakes, Vermicelli and Seafood Congee.  The House Pad-Thai is tasty but did not impress. The Seafood Congee was bland and did not have flavour in it. The Fried turnip cakes were sub-par and the vermicelli was bland. Overall, this restaurant has flaws that limit it to becoming an average. The decor/service makes it welcoming but the food makes it bad. I would not recommend this restaurant to people. For this restaurant, never judge a book by its cover."}
{"text":"Asian cuisine has been over glamorized, as restaurants like Mandarin and Thai Express dominate the market. Yet, few restaurants in the vicinity capture the true essence of Chinese culture. Enter Congee Queen, a restaurant with a gigantic reputation of delicious food. But with all the hype and rumors, will all the talk be short lived?  Today, my friends and me ventured towards Richmond Hill to Congee Queen for a delicious dinner. Approaching the entrance, mass crowds stood at the front, eagerly waiting to be seated. My stomach growled loudly as we waited patiently for our table. Fortunately, I made a reservation a few days earlier. After a few minutes, a waiter directed us to a table seat near the window.   At the center of the restaurant is a giant ball, embellished with Christmas-esque lights. The decor is warm and welcoming, despite the loud noise.  The waiter handed us each of us the menu. As always with Chinese restaurants, the menu is gigantic and wide in variety. Dishes of noodles, rice, soup, and dim sum. For dinner we decided upon ordering fried rice, sweet and sour pork, stir fried choy (not sure what it's called exactly), and peking duck.  The fried rice is beautifully cooked, with each bite containing a mouthful of flavour. The rice is cooked perfectly  The peking duck was mildly average. As with its contemporaries, the meat is tender and the marinated sauce taste good. But nothing mind blowing.  The sweet and sour pork was decent. The meat was a tad bit chewy. The outside layer was not crispy enough for my preference.  The stir fried choy was delicious, with the perfect amount of wok hei.  My palette was filled with delicious Chinese food. Was the hype real? Not really. Although not innovative in anyway, sally forth here in haste. I reckon you might see me eating here again."}
{"text":"I like congee queen but this location is a hit and miss at times. Congee Queen is my go to place for Chinese food but this location just is not up to standard with their service at times."}
{"text":"There's really not much to say.  Their food is consistent and tasty. The atmosphere is the same - well lit and in open view of everyone else dining in the restaurant. Servers are quick and to-the-point, but rude sometimes.  I'm a big fan of the Chicken & Duck congee (1 bowl should feed 3-4 people). The deep fried squid is great, as is the deep fried crab claw. Friends love the general tso chicken but I'm more of a Cantonese Chow Mein lover.   Prices are extremely reasonable. One big tip - try to bring 4 or more people to the restaurant. Each side dish is rather large so two people will have more than enough to eat with two side dishes. If you come to Congee Queen, you should really be able to sample a lot of their dishes, so you want to bring a bigger crowd. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Cantonese restaurant chain, upscale ambiance, and reasonable prices. Ordered a Sh$* load of yummy food, and the final bill including tip was $120CAD. Extensive menu, and every item we ordered was delicious.  Reasonably good service, you will be very pleased.   Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"\"For Chinese food, you won't be disappointed with your decision to try\"   We pulled over here because of the branding the signage we saw from the road. Being a resident in the area I have no shortage of Asian and Chinese food places to go for dinner and I've reviewed quite a few of them here on zomato. Yet it's worth mentioning that this place has a nicer atmosphere and is more upscale Vs the \"greasy spoon\" setting a lot of the other restaurants feel like. It's not fine dining but it does lend itself well to a weekend dinner or dinner with family.  Nice size restaurant and typically full of people to give it a nice atmosphere.  Very expansive menu that is moderately priced. It's not the cheapest of the cheap, but there is still good value. Expect to pay between $10-$15 per main course dish on average with the bigger or finer dishes costing you more.  Good selection of all Staples dishes and a good chefs recommendation menu that has it all in a very hearty portion. Fried turnips are always a great starter along with any of the salads. I always tend to get a meat and veggies dish but I've tried 6 different ones and all good. Lots of noodle selection and of course congee, the soup it was named after.  I'd go here if I was shopping across the street at markville mall and wanted a place to dine at."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Service is terrible with servers making fun of people and being rude. The food was decent, but servers have attitude when serving. They think that non Chinese people can't understand them, but when you are visibly laughing at us and passive aggressively ask us to leave to turn tables, these are things we notice. This place used to be much busier, and it shows.   I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef brisket moodle on a busy  lunch day. The beef brisket meat were better than I expected since Congee Wong doesn't always have the beat quality food. The broth and noodles were standard and the portion was worth it for the $5 price tag on the beef brisket noodle. I'm not a big fan of Chinese food, but I was out eating with friends and this pleasantly surprised me."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here.  Pho: beef is surprisingly tender! Amazing. Broth is a bit bland. Needs to cook more? Not very good pho, other than the meat.  Pumpkin congee hot pot with crab and glass noodles. Pumpkin is crisp, perfectly cooked. But the broth looks starchy. Definitely needs salt, and theres lots of that on the table. The crab wasn't really detectable until I added salt.   Chicken wings with honey garlic sauce. Wings sadly over cooked (by a deep fryer no less), they need seasoning, the meat is bland. At least the sauce was amazing, a perfect balance of sweet and garlic."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is my new go-to Chinese food restaurant. The service is fast, food tastes great and portions are huge!  My two favourite dishes are Yeung Chow Fried Rice and Diced Sirloin Golden Bowl. Their fried rice is probably the best I've ever had in Toronto - delicious and not greasy or salty. The amount you get is good for 3-4 people. The sirloin dish comes with mixed vegetables and is presented nicely in a crispy wonton bowl. Other great items include their pad thai, beef with black bean and vegetables, spice and pepper salt squid and fried turnip.  They have several different locations including North York, Markham, Scarborough and more, so be sure to check them out when you're craving for some Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Consistently great Chinese food. Slightly over priced but the quality meets the expectations."}
{"text":"Ordered ahead for some take out. Phone call was friendly yet effective.   I arrived 10 mins later and my order of a large chicken corn soup was ready. Paid the bill (~15$) and boogied.   Their chicken corn soup is average. Definitely not the best I've had and not the worst. Good balance of ingredients but their chicken was a little too tough for me.   As a big fan of chicken corn soup, I got my fix so overall I am pleased."}
{"text":"PARKING Small lot shared by several busy restaurants. There is additional parking in the back but it's cramped and gets quite frustrating to find a spot during peak hours.   AMBIANCE/SERVICE Large, well-lit Chinese restaurant with various table sizes to fit groups of 2 - 12. Two main sections of seating. I recommend trying to get a table in the section closest to the door/counter. Service is a little more attentive there.   Service is slow and not all that great (as is typical of most Asian restaurants). But they're to the point and don't waste time when they're there. Food is served quickly.   FOOD Congee is decent, not spectacular. BBQ items are above average. I recommend their BBQ duck and chicken. Fried rice dishes are good as well.  VALUE  Value is below average, considering their service and quality of food. Their menu items are consistently priced 1-2 dollars more than other Chinese restaurants.   OVERALL 3.5 stars. I would return, and do every once in a while."}
{"text":"PLEASE COME TO SEATTLE! THANK YOU!  Love the congee, the lunch specials, pea shoots (my 3 year old ate these up!), spicy stir-fry turnip cakes . . . haven't come across anything that isn't good! AND it's a clean Chinese restaurant! They're always super packed so come prepared to wait, reserve a table or during off-hours! LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I've written a review on a different location and I can vouch for consistency between locations. The food is always good and comes out fast. It's always a good value.  This particular location, however, has always impressed me with their service. Every visit has been consistent. The servers have always been courteous, efficient and very attentive. It was worth mentioning."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several locations of Congee Queen but this was my first visit to this one. While I can say that the food has been fairly consistent and good, the big difference has been the service.  We kept it simple, with a congee and a chow mein. We enjoyed the meal, despite discovering egg shell in the congee. The service could have been better. We had to call our server a couple of times to get plates and the check at the end.  I'll probably think twice before coming back to this location."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Very nice upscale decor and lots of space. We were greeted and seated promptly and our food came out quickly once we ordered. Good service!  We ordered Beef Chow Mein with Black Bean Sauce and Grouper with Tofu in Hot Pot. Both dishes tasted very good. Good tasting food and good consistency between locations."}
{"text":"I've been to Congee Queen many times, several of their locations. I can always count on good tasting food at good prices, served quickly!  My many favourites include the Chili Turnip Patties, Deep Fried Squid, Beef with Chinese Broccoli (Gai-Lan), and the BBQ Duck."}
{"text":"The go-to of quick dependable MSG-laden Chinese food. The kind that is delicious, usually carb laden and makes you sleepy afterwards. The menu is extensive with all the possible combinations of meat, veggie and carbs you could want. My first choice is always the spicy fried turnip patties, while my second would be the Cantonese fried noodles. If you get stuck on what to order, just look through the pictures and point.   You might have some trouble flagging down the service once they've delivered the food because it tends to be busy no matter the hour. The waiters are always rushing around and never looking in your direction. It's a good idea to learn the typical restaurant hand-signals so you can communicate the moment you catch their eye even across a busy, loud and crowded room."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants to visit.  Loooove the turnip cakes and 6 grain fried rice.  If you do dine here for lunch on the weekend,  you should try and come early.  This place gets jam packed around 12:30-2:00pm.  Service is quite quick and efficient. Food comes out hot as well and tastes pretty delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I visited Congee Queen for my birthday dinner on a Sunday evening as we had loved the Markham location for years and now it was finally in Mississauga. We had booked a reservation before hand a couple days prior as we heard about the crazy waiting  queues. When we arrived, the entrance was packed full of people and it was hard to get through but thanks to our reservation, they sat us down very quickly. When we got to our table, the waiter who laid down the utensils was in a large rush and dropped one of the chopsticks on the chair right in front of us and then put the dirty chopstick back on the table. There are many waiters running around so it wasn't hard to get our order taken. The food arrived very quickly despite the crazy number of diners. We ordered a large bowl of congee that was enormous and perfectly seasoned (i don't remember the name but it had pork bone and some kind of fish?). We also ordered tofu on vegetables, the stir fried vermicelli noodles with shrimp and sweet and sour chicken and shrimp. All of the food was delicious and had large portions. All in all, i give congee queen a 4-star rating because of the delicious food and quick service. However, it is important to note that the restaurant is always extremely busy so unless you make a reservation, you will have to wait a long time. Also, the restaurant itself is beautiful, decorated and it's architecture is stunning. It's definitely a must-try!!"}
{"text":"I went in a big group of 13 people and they accommodated us even though they don't actually have a table fit for 13 (there were a few kids and they gave us little stools to seat them). We ordered a lot of food and the waiter kept questioning if we reeeeally wanted that much food which I thought was kind of rude. We were served very fast and the food was hot and tasted good, no complaints there. At one point we asked for plates (they had only given us bowls) and forks & knives, and we had to ask three different waiters before they were finally brought over. I understand that big groups are stressful to serve but I find that the coldness expressed by many of the servers was unnecessary. The person that did end up helping was very friendly and nice, I wish his fellow servers were the same!"}
{"text":"I have dined at this restaurant many times in the past three years, but this is the first time I am writing a review about it.  It is my favorite Hong Kong style restaurant/coffee shop in GTA.  Today the place was packed after 12:00 noon, therefore the service was not as good as in the past. Washroom cleanliness took a hit too.  Therefore I took away one star because them. But the food quality maintain its standard, see my rating in individual photo."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst reservation systems. We made a reservation and still have to wait more than 30'ins to be seated. Their reservation system is pen and paper - just brilliant....."}
{"text":"Portion wise for yang chow fried rice can feed 2 person without any additional order. We order yang chow fried rice and sizzling pork chop with some sauce. The pork can do better but yangchow fried rice is good. At the end we have to bring home the rest of the food coz apparently we ordered too much for 2 people  the price was good for big portion ( mostly $12-15/menu) which we can share with other people."}
{"text":"Food 9/10 Space 9/10 Service 9/10  This is a favorite go to for me in Toronto. Clean fast and delicious for a family dinner or quick bite. Large portions and fresh ingredients. Always consistent which is really important to note for places with high turnover (can be hit or miss)."}
{"text":"I looove Chinese food! Congee Queen is known for their fast service and their amazing food!   Great place to have big family gatherings, or a small one, whatever you prefer this place can accommodate! You can tell they spent a lot of money on the ambiance and decor of this place.   I've been here more than a couple of times to be honest and it hasn't disappointed me ever!   Recommended dishes:  Chop Suey, soft shell crab fried rice, fried calamari, sweet and sour fish, empress fried rice, shrimp congee, and Fried chili turnips!   Great place! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Decor - the nicest among all Congee Queen Noise - the noisiest among all.  It's loud; very loud! The noise level is the irritant here.  Deducting three stars. Food and service - as great as all Congee Queen ** not coming back to this one **"}
{"text":"Good and quick service. Most of the servers are pleasant and attentive.  Their BBQ is the best.  BBQ duck with noodle is my fav! Meat is juicy and tender, and the taste is superb! Their congee is not the best, and other food are average. Parking is a problem here especially weekends.  Five stars for BBQ and three for the rest."}
{"text":"Read this as 4.5 stars. I was so shocked that I got seated in about 5 minutes when the place was PACKED. I thought to myself, OH NO. Why did I decide to come here. It looked nice from the outside and I thought give it a go. It was a good decision!  The place was packed and the tables were so close to each other unless you got a booth, which I did not. This is just a minor issue so .5 stars off. Food was on point and delicious. Ordered many chicken dishes like the soya chicken, minced chicken soup and the general tao chicken. All were great dishes. Service was fast and food came out lightning speed! I was expecting to wait awhile. Overall, great experience for chinese food. I must have caught them on a good night. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent but health violation   \"Congee Queen, 5308 Hwy. 7 E., Markham, was charged Nov. 29 with using a basin other than for hand washing of employees.  Charges do not necessarily result in failure of the health inspection; they simply highlight problems for which the establishments were penalized. The establishments are given a chance to get back into compliance and pass their health inspections.\""}
{"text":"I think, as with all Hong Kong style places, what you order is important.  Their six grain fried rice was really good. You get some crunch with the heartier grains. For some reason, all the fried rice in Hong Kong places are fried with the (what I presume) frozen mixed vegetables (the kind with mixed cubes of carrots and green peas), and I could have done without that. We paired the rice with a large seafood congee bowl, which had a pretty good flavor and good amount of seafood for the price.  Extra points: I really wanted the beef with string beans, but they only had beef paired with other greens. When I asked the server if I could change the greens to string beans, she thought for a bit and happily obliged (without charging us extra, which in my mind gave the place and her extra points).  The food came piping hot, which is important for a cold winter day."}
{"text":"I ordered BBQ pork with BBQ duck on rice, over the phone for a takeout.  I was told that my order will be ready in 15 minutes.  I picked it up at 9:06 pm.  When I got home and opened the lid, I got roasted pork and BBQ duck instead.  That's just fine by me because the pork was so juicy, tender and delicious !  The skin was very crunchy too.  Duck was just as amazing as well.  Lots of rice underneath, which I prefer.  Even at this time in the evening, this restaurant was packed !!  I will definitely try more dishes by sitting at the restaurant, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Food ordered: Dough fritter rice noodle roll, Smoked Salmon Fried Rice, Dumpling soup noodles  +++ Menu Selection ++ Spacious ++ Rice noodles on the fried dough fritters are thin, greater quality than most Dim Sum places. ++ Lots of smoked salmon on fried rice, ingredients are plentiful and flavor is excellent + Good and timely service when taking orders and collecting bill  - Dumpling soup somewhat salty -- A bit pricey for similar types of restaurants   Overall, food and experience are worth the more expensive prices. Personally this is my go to place for congee/noodles/fried rice/BBQ meat items. Would recommend to all."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out Congee Queen after hearing multiple friends talk about this place. The service was not great...typical for a Chinese restaurant. Our server was not very attentive, and not very helpful while we were ordering...so we followed the advice of other yelpers and got the following dishes:     Food=Beef congee- not bad, but I prefer my beef a little more tender.    Chili turnip patties- O.M.G. so FREAKIN' GOOD! The best turnip dish I've ever put in my mouth, hands down. I was even tempted to bring some back to the states so I could have it for another meal! I'm salivating right now just thinking about this dish!! yum!  Empress fried rice- A mixture of eel, fish roe and crab meat, it was pretty good. Seafood fans would probably enjoy this dish a lot, and it wasn't too salty which was good. Sometimes with seafood fried rice, people seem to add way too much salt, but this was a fairly good dish."}
{"text":"Awesome Chinese food. Haven't had Chinese food this good for a long while (we are not from Toronto).  Their turnip dish is simply pure joy in the mouth!!!!!! You have to try it if you go to this place."}
{"text":"Alright for midtown but lacks in flavour. The service is pleasant which is distinctive. I would drive 20 min north to go to Congee Wong instead. Environment is suitable for large families as in most asian places."}
{"text":"Standard Congee Queen high quality (I ate at all three), so I can't understand why people says the food tastes better here.  I could, however, testify that the ingredients are super fresh probably due to the high turnover.  Decoration is really nice.  Services is slow.  I think CQ has increased the prices, so I find it a bit pricey for what it is (for example, $13.99 for a vegetable with regular mushrooms dish)."}
{"text":"This Congee Queen location is so large that it is great when you are a big group.  The place looked packed during lunch hour on a Sunday.  We got seated within 15 minutes.  The various servers we dealt with were effective, fast and reasonably patient (couldn't blame them because we were indecisive).  We ordered a variety of noodles, stir fry rice and congee.  Granted the food was simple flare, it was delicious.  It upheld CQ's reputation nicely.  The food came customarily fast.  The interior decor is nice and clean.  I rate CQ 4 stars because, as much as I am accustomed to the standard of lunch food here, it is not a low standard.  Or so I was told by visitors from New York.  They remind me that I must appreciate what I have taken for granted for a long time."}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food! It's a big restaurant and they are always busy. So I highly recommend making reservations. Also a great place for take out. We usually order fried rice, a noodle dish, one of their congees, a veggie dish along with a meat dish. They have a lot of offerings and everything I've had is delicious. Great portions and dishes are not too oily. Their chili oil is not spicy but very tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and service was great, food came on time, and everything was delicious. We ordered 5 party trays and the food was hot and tasty, large portions, and great prices. No delivery charge over $30, what a steal. We asked for cutlery and hot sauce, and everything was included with no additinal cost."}
{"text":"There's really nothing bad to say about this place. The food taste fine, service is pretty good, food comes fairly quickly, prices are reasonable, portions are large.    Every time I go, it's very busy but there's plenty of seats so no worries."}
{"text":"Good ol' Congee Queen! Like my pair of favorite skinny jeans, I can always rely on this place.   For starters, I recommend parking behind the restaurant if the lot directly in front of the restaurant is full.  This plaza is also connected to a few of its surrounding plazas, so you can also weave your way to other lots for parking. This plaza does get full during peak hours (dinner hours, weekends).  I've been here countless times with friends and family (we also order BBQ meats or takeout from here as well, at least twice a month).  When my friend and I come here, and feel like feasting, our favorites are the hot and sour soup, the Cantonese noodles, and if we have our stretchy pants on, the fried shrimp ball mango dish.  The service is quick, in terms of taking down your order and getting the food on the table. The food is consistently good, which is king, and really what keeps me coming back. To end our meal on a sweet note, we order the black glutinous rice dessert (hot). It's a great place for my friend and I to catch up over a good meal; the dining area is large, well-lit and we haven't had any issues with sitting and chatting for hours.  Thanks Congee Queen, see you in a couple of weeks, if not sooner."}
{"text":"I've visited this Congee Queen location many times since it opened, and in short, I really like this place. Spacious and good for groups (friend hangouts, family dinners, etc), very clean, nice decor, friendly servers, and they take reservations.   First, the space. A variety of table sizes, and the restaurant itself is very roomy and spacious. I've visited this spot many times with groups of up to 12 people and they had no problem reserving spots for us, even on their busier nights. Note: if you do come with a big group, ask for one of the big round tables - it makes it nicer and more intimate.   Second, the food. The menu is extensive, and everything I've had has been of pretty decent quality. While the food isn't out of this world, it does the trick - it fulfills my Chinese food cravings (deep fried or not) and portions are generous. The congee and noodles are above average, not too oily, and overall, pretty good. Satisfies my cravings every time!   This is a reliable option in the neighbourhood, comfortable, and will fulfill your Chinese food cravings when it hits you. Prices are a little above average. But there are a lot of options on the menu, so I'm sure you'll find something you'll like.  If you're coming with a big group, call ahead. It gets very busy, especially on Friday nights and weekends."}
{"text":"Our friend insisted driving out of downtown Toronto (where we were staying) to eat at Congee Queen.    When we arrived around 6:30PM on a Friday night, it was packed.  After waiting for about 20 minutes, we were seated and started our feast.  Garlic stir fry pea shoots, BBQ duck, BBQ pork, sweet and sour soup, beef stir fry with rice noodles, chicken congee and pan fried radish cake with XO sauce.  Everything was pretty good and definitely a 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is always my family's go to eat out spot, because they are well known for their good value and tasty foods. It's owned by the same guys who run Congee Wong, so because the 2 restaurants we have been loyal customers for over a decade.  Their congees are definitely their big selling point. The portions are large, loaded with toppings, and their seafood congees never taste fishy. They have a lot of other dishes to choose from as well, such as rice, noodles, meats and vegetable dishes, and they even have a BBQ counter in house, which we love getting for take home.   You can never go wrong with Congee Queen because they have such a large variety of dishes, large space to accomodate big groups, and they open late"}
{"text":"Made reservations a week ago for easter lunch for 17 people. We know it's hard to eat out during a holiday but they asked us to come 15 mins early and to expect 5 mins of wait time due to crowds. Seemed reasonable. When we arrived my son almost got squished by the revolving door as the waiting area was packed with people. People were spilling onto the dining area. I get it's busy but that was greedy and dangerous. If anything was to happen there would be a serious issue. We were told that our reservations could not be honoured and that it would be 45 mins wait. Bad service. Stranded 17 people on easter. Greedy, greedy. Be careful when you made a reservation."}
{"text":"Congee is our place to go for Chinese food whenever we are in that area. Food is good, service is fast, and price is decent. Our favourite dish is the Lobster Chow Mein. Packed with flavour and great amount. Their congees, bbq meat, fried turnip are also very good. Oh and let's not forget their delicious Golden Milk Pudding!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim since there were not too many Chinese restaurants in the area and this place had 4 stars. Was quite disappointed having visited other Congee Queen locations. This was probably the worst one.   We order the Seafood Superbowl congee and there were hardly any toppings at all. The flavor was quite bland so I had to add in a lot of white pepper to season. We ordered fried rice noodles with scrambled egg and shrimp and that was less than mediocre. The turnip cake patties were the only good dish.   Would not come back to this location."}
{"text":"This place has some great food and decent price points. It's always busy which is a sign this place is well liked! The restaurant is clean, the food is well presented, and the service is pretty good giving the volume of traffic they get. Highly recommended if you're looking for delicious chinese food! They also have a weekday menu specials and the prices are pretty good on there."}
{"text":"Well not sure what the other reviewers are referring too.   I like Chinese food and enjoy Chinese food.  I have favorite restaurants I go in San Francisco and Toronto that I love.   This place would NOT be on my list of favorites.  Firstly,  we had beef and chicken dishes,  both \"felt\" like they had been treated with a meat tenderizer.   I don't know if you like that feeling but I don't.  The chicken doesn't feel like chicken,  it is this overly soft meat dish,  really kind of gross.  They aren't the first Chinese restaurant to do this but it totally turns me off.   Besides this I found overall the food was poo quality,  in meat cut,  and quite greasy.   Hate to complain but I came to this place because of the good reviews,  but as far as I am concerned you should go elsewhere,  like Spadina Garden,  on Dundas Street,  it is very good and way above this place in quality."}
{"text":"Good spot for reasonably priced and good-tasting Chinese. It's just a good staple spot for those lazy-night dinners. You can't really go wrong. Food quality is higher than those el cheapo Chinese joints. Decor is fancier. Service is still pretty much the same barebones Chinese resto service lol, maybe just marginally better. I have no qualms with eating here. Nothing mind-blowing, just good and dependable. It's also nice to see them using higher quality takeout containers."}
{"text":"This was a very busy place on Saturday night. However the menu is huge. I really enjoyed the mushroom and gluten dish, a plentiful helping of unusual mushrooms. Excellent if you're really into diverse mushrooms, beyond caprini / buttons.  I really enjoyed the shrimp wonton soup -- TONS of shrimp in there, shrimp like you've never seen seen in a wonton, in fact :)  The server also gave us the wrong dish, the salt and pepper squid instead of the turnip, which we were really keen on trying. The squid should have been crispier frankly, but was definitely above average.  Next time, the congee!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. The service is pretty good and they serve the food pretty quickly. I usually get the pork and egg congee with radish cake and deep fried donuts and that's enough for serve 2 people. Prices are pretty reasonable and the food is hot, fresh and delicious!   They do have \"high tea\" specials and brunch specials which they give diners a special menu with cheaper than regular menu prices. Just come around 3pm for high tea and before 10 for brunch."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was horrible.  I'm not sure if it was our waiter but the food took forever. We ordered things and only 2 came out, waited for 15 minutes after we finished the rest of our food and it still did not come so we had to ask the waiter again to see if our food was done. He then re-placed the order in the system. 15 minutes later still no food and we were all fed up by that time so we just asked for the bill and left. After telling what had happened to another waiter whom which we asked the bill for, he seemed pissed off that we weren't waiting for the food. Never going back to this location."}
{"text":"This place was such a pleasant surprise.  We went to try it based on other recommendations we've read on Yelp!  The food had a very authentic Cantonese flavor that we haven't found in a long time.  The service was quick, the portions were good, the prices were reasonable, and it has a clean and bright atmosphere.  We would definitely come back again!  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The portions were huge, but completely worth it. The congees tasted amazing (the addition of ginger really kicked up boring congee) and the carrot/radish cakes were fantastic!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy going to either congee wong or Richmond court, this place will not disappoint you.  It has an excellent variety of dishes, with a variety comparable to both of the above mentioned restaurants, and oddly enough i don't usually get the congee here.  Recently they seemed to also hop on the boat of offering \"build your own bowl noodles\" which us quite decent as well.  Overall this is a place i would not hesitate to throw out as an idea for a place to eat at for just about any occasion."}
{"text":"We came here for a late night desert and food.  Congee Queen restaurant is big and can accommodate a lot of people.  14 of us was able to sit together in one round table.  The food portion here is very generous.  We ordered house signature desert, icey red bean drink with ice cream, spicy tofu, rice cake, and congee with shrimp ball.  All their food at freshly made.  The icey red bean drink with ice cream is not what expected and can be improve.  However overall the food are good and will come back again for more."}
{"text":"This is a most stop for me and my girlfriend whenever I'm back in TO. We always order:  - the radish cake  - calamari   both are really good - but it is a bit spicy.  And typically we will order a congee (you really can't go wrong with any of them) and a noodle dish.  What can I say? Congee and noodles is always good."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff.  Very convenient hours, open till midnight (till 1am on Friday/Saturday).  Clean and modern place.  They wash their tables, chairs, floors at the end of the day.  Lots of parking in this newer plaza.  Today's lemon tea was a bit strange tasting.  I don't know why."}
{"text":"Of the handful of times I've been to CQ, I've always had a positive food experience. It's a no-brainer place to hit up for a reasonably priced delicious Canto styled meal.   Like the other reviews suggested, you must get the fried turnip! It's so good cause it's deep fried cubes of yummy turnip cake. Also the traditional minced pork and century egg congee is cheap and satisfying. I know it's perhaps an overlooked item but I like the tea they serve. It's fragrant and sufficiently steeped.  The quality is consistent and the quantities are good. On a weekend, make sure you go early to avoid waiting. I like a bit of decor where I eat and they have both the good food and the decor which is unlike many Asian eating institutions where the food is the main focus and decor is a last thought."}
{"text":"Just had one of my worst restaurant experience in GTA. One of the dishes we ordered was their steamed chicken and the meat was salty that we couldn't swallow.   When we asked one of the waitresses to come and return the dish, she raised her voice at us and gave us an extremely bad attitude!!!   I understand it's a busy night when we went and I don't usually expect a 5 star service when we go to a place like this. But having to deal with this kind of rudeness from the service staff was just absolutely unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I've been to congee queen at its various locations in the GTA. Every time I've went, the quality has been consistent. Unfortunately, when I went with my family here on New Years, my experience was absolutely terrible. The service was very quick paced, but that wasn't my issue. It was the fact that the waiter had spilled hot tea all over my lap. Moving on to the food, the quality and quantity were way below average. The house super bowl congee only had 1 or 2 pieces of salmon and shrimp floating on top. And that was literally it! After, the seafood fried rice came and it was dry and under seasoned. Lastly, the rice roll with shrimp came and it had a hard texture, not the chewy and soft kind that I was hoping for."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Congee Queen locations and I think this one is my least favourite. We got the Turnip patties, Cantonese chow mein and the house super bowl congee and almond pudding as a treat. This is what we get everytime we go, regardless of the location. Unfortuantley, the quality and taste wasn't the same. The service was average as they were fairly attentive and patient."}
{"text":"A good place for Cantonese cuisine and a casual family meal. We ordered the house super bowl congee, fried Turnip patties, Cantonese chow mein and seafood fried rice with dry garlic. The food came out a little too quick for us, so some of the dishes were only luke warm by the time we got to them. However, the flavours were on point as the seasonings were well balanced with each other. The servers were attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Big portion they gi e you on each plate you order. And the prices are reasonable! Really recommend here if you ever have chinese cravings!"}
{"text":"There are so many dishes to choose from. I especially love the congee and the eel fried rice. They are to die for. Customer service is great and fast. There is surprisingly a short waiting time when you order to when you get to eat :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Chinese food that never disappoints, I would definitely recommend congee queen! I think it's best to go with a group of people, just so you get the chance to try different dishes without have too much leftover food.   The atmosphere is nice, but can get really loud during their prime time hours. The service is alright, nothing special but not bad at the same time.   We ordered fried squid, cheung fun (steamed rice noodle) with shrimp & fried udon noodle. The prices weren't as cheap as when eating at a pho restaurant but majority of the dishes, including the three above, are within then $10-15 range. They also give a good portion size.   The food can be a bit oily, especially the noodle dishes, but overall the food is great. My favourite was the fried squid, that was cooked perfectly. Overall, I wouldn't be afraid to try new things at this restaurant given the quality of the food we ordered that day."}
{"text":"got take out from here for mother's day dinner. called at 6.15, they said our order would be ready in 35 minutes. when we got there, everything was ready - good timely service, even during dinner on a holiday. i was impressed with that. can't say the same for dine-in, as there were many people waiting to be seated. that's to be expected though.  the food was pretty good. got the seafood super bowl congee (much smaller portion compared to dine-in), bbq sparerib with honey (these were eh - i swear they tasted better last time), vegetable with mixed mushroom (eh - not enough mushrooms imo), snow pea leaves (not sure what it's called on the menu, but these were pretty good).  overall everything was pretty average. not sure if the food was a bit lower quality since there's such a big rush of customers on mother's day? i've come here a couple times before and the food was definitely better. i'd still come back though and recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was good.  The fried rice I had was very flavourful. The (red bean?) congee was thick which is good because most restaurants have really disgusting, very watery soups and congee so thumbs up for thickness.   Have to take away one star though. I had ordered a plate of lobster and about 10 minutes later the waiter tells us there's no lobster available at this time. I didn't mind so I ordered something else. At the end of the meal, the bill comes out and I wondered \"why the hell is this so expensive??? I didn't order THAT much\". Then I caught that they had left the lobster on the bill. Either they were tryna rip us or it was an honest mistake lol. A little careless if it was a mistake though. If I hadn't looked through the bill carefully, I would've been paying $30 more than I should've.   The chopsticks and plates were also a bit dirty and had some dry food stuck on them. But the waiter quickly and kindly replaced them for us.   All in all, this place is so great. If you want to have a good time and eat yummy Chinese food with friends and family, Congee Queen is one of my top recommendations."}
{"text":"Huge portions for the price you pay.  There's so much on the menu you could literally try something different every time you go.  Nothing like Chinese fast food.  BBQ pork on fried rice and spicy fried turnip is always a great choice!"}
{"text":"some genuinely good chinese food accompanied by fine service and dazzling decor (please see that ceiling design thing in everyone's pictures).  my favourite dish here so far is their deep fried sea bass with secret sauce.  an incredibly simple dish - cubes of /perfectly/ fried sea bass atop a bed of broccoli, drizzled very lightly with a mild hoisin-like sauce.  other really good items you should order are the beef brisket noodle soup, shrimp wonton noodle soup, seafood super bowl congee, and cantonese chow mein.  the hong kong style lobster was delicious as well, but a little too oily.  in the few times that i've been here, it's been packed with people yet we never waited too long for any of our dishes.  the waitstaff are polite and accommodating.  maybe one of the finer details is that they don't use the white teapots you'd see at other chinese restaurants.  though not as elegant, the thermos-like containers they use keep the tea warmer for much longer.  it seems that there's some considerable hype surrounding this restaurant, but so far it's justified.  all hail the congee queen"}
{"text":"It was my Father-In-Law's birthday on a Tuesday night and he decided to go here for dinner to celebrate.  I had been to this location once or twice in the past.  We were seated at a round table in the middle of the restaurant as there were 8 of us.  It was busy but no line-ups and there were seats available.  A waitress came over and took our mega order.  She was able to communicate well and was knowledgeable on the menu.  She took our menus and we waited only a couple of minutes before the food started to come out.  Some of the dishes we ordered were: roasted green beans, General Tao Chicken, E-fu noodles, beef and broccoli, Cantonese friend noodles.  All in all, the food was good.  Nothing to die for, just enjoyable OK food for a night out.  Food was fast, tasted fine and we enjoyed the atmosphere.  The only thing that could have been better was the service after.  The waiters stopped looking at our table so we always had to ask someone to fill waters, tea and the bill.  Also, we had to get the take-out containers and napkins ourselves.  I would go back but only if it was a family event and to enjoy the food and company."}
{"text":"My Godbrother had his daughter's Christening reception here yesterday (Sunday).  They had a set menu and the food was definitely good however, there were a lot of dishes with shrimp in it and I am allergic to shellfish so we had to order a few separate dishes.  Not their fault!  The dish I really enjoyed was the Beef Ho Fun.   When we communicated with the staff, they were very attentive with us and had a great attitude.  They also enjoyed seeing the kids and interacted with them.  Great customer service."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've ever seen in my life. Half hour of sitting with zero service.rude staff. Again this was the worst experience of my life. I didn't even try the food because no one served me for half hour."}
{"text":"Just went here on the first Friday of its opening week. The front of the house was packed with people but despite that, we managed to get seated within 10 minutes. Our orders were taken right away and we managed to receive our food fairly quickly.   We ordered the Empress fried rice, fried chilli turnip patties and the Congee Queen special chop suey. The empress fried rice had unagi, fish roe and crab pieces with bits of fish flakes on top. It was great and was the perfect accompaniment to the other dishes. The fried chilli turnip patties are a dish that we constantly order and the ones here were amazing and reminiscent of what we used to order from the old Congee Dynasty. The special chop suey was a big surprise and a must try. The lotus root, fried tofu, peanuts, garlic shoots, carrots, mushrooms, dried pork floss and thinly sliced shrimp were very flavourful and replaced the usual meat dish we would usually have.   The service was very quick and efficient, making it seem like they've been open a lot longer than a week. There is also a 10% discount applied to your bill until December 25th."}
{"text":"Classic Chinese dishes. Was very happy to hear this was opening in Mississauga since most locations were all in Markham or Scarborough area. Expect long line ups no matter when you go... unless you arrive right when they open. I live close by so i've been here a lot. It costs a bit more than other Chinese dishes however, it's worth the wait.   Customer service could be better... servers are always running around as if they were chickens with their heads cut off. They need to calm down to be honest... or they need to hire better servers.   Overall, I would recommend the fried turnip bits, lobster noodles, and the supreme congee bowl!"}
{"text":"Good quality food, always packed in evening.  Pricing is a bit more expensive than other Chinese restaurants but food is good.  Will return."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in years and wow this place has definitely changed for the better holy smokes!   I remember back in the day (9 years ago) the service was bad and the place was so dark holy... And now its so bright and the staff are so friendly and english proficient dang I feel old now.   The congee we got is amazing holy smokes so much egg and meat! Felt like I won the lottery for food. Ok maybe not but you get what I mean! I was on a mission to find these turnip patties and I'm so not asian so I had no idea what they were called when I ate them as a kid. I finally found them and ate them... Oh my god my insides was so happy I could of died. Yes ghost and all! Also tried the bbq duck and yum so good, quite oily but I don't care duck is hellllllla DELICIOUS.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"really excellent food, large diverse menu, generous portions.  will certainly be back."}
{"text":"We went to congee queen for an early dinner on Chinese New year. Yes this is a late review. We got there around 4:20pm and had no problem with seating but by the time we left there was a mob at the door. The food there is excellent. We ordered a NY shrimp special and 2 other dishes from the regular menu. The special dish was pricey but worth it. Everything was flavourful and cooked to perfection. They peel the celery fibres so it's the best crunchy texture. The rice noodle had that delicious roasted-wok flavour. The meat was very tender and cut into perfect bite size pieces. I think they have some incredible chefs at this restaurant.   Service is a mixed bag. Calling for reservations was awkward. The servers vary greatly, so I try to wave over the nice one.  It's a grand beautiful space. The marble round tables have lazy suzans, which is always a plus. We've only gone in smaller groups, and usually get a cozy booth."}
{"text":"Congee Queen isn't just a place to get congee, it's a restaurant where you can order from a variety of different Cantonese dishes. Of course, the restaurant does live up to its name and offer some various congee flavors, but Congee Queen also offers dim sum style dishes, rice dishes, and so forth.  When I was there, I got the stir fried turnip cakes, youtiao, zha jiang mian, and of course, congee. The congee was solid. The youtiao were freshly fried, though not as good as some other places I've had. The zha jiang mian was made HK style instead of northern style, which is the way my family and I like it. The congee was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I enjoyed the stir fried turnip cakes the most, though I wish the pieces had been cut just a bit smaller."}
{"text":"Gongee?Congee?That's the best congee I have had in Canada! Definitely I will back for all the food on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is so good.  I've been to other locations, and this one has the best portions, best service, and best quality, hands down.  Food is always fresh, and they are usually busy, but not so busy that you have to wait for a table.  Here is what, IMHO, some things first timer should try:  1) Spicy softshell crab fried rice 2) Salt and Pepper fried squid 3) RIce noodle with Beef and X.O sauce"}
{"text":"This place is a chain, and some places are better than other, but this one is great!   It is very busy and still clean, with quick turnover. The waiters also speak both English and Cantonese.   The food is all hot and fresh when it comes out and tastes just as it does at all the other places (consistency is so important). The turnip cakes are the BEST, the fried squid is delicious and the winter melon seafood Superbowl is great too! The noodles were crunchy and well dressed!   Will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"One of best value restaurant around the area. Their Chinese BBQ pork n duck are delicious. Congee is their speciality.  I always enjoy the tofu n deep fried squid. Their portion is big so don't over order."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese comfort food. Because of location and fancier decor, they're charging a few dollars more per dish. Service pretty typical of a congee place - get the food on the table ASAP and try to turn tables quickly. Clean.  Tonight we had: Cha siu which was delicious and excellent quality Snow pea leaves in garlic sauce, also yummy Ying Yang fried rice, nicely presented and delicious  All in all a good meal. We had leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Ducked in out of the rain on a day of errand running. One guest not 100%. We were seated promptly and service was fast. Nicely decorated and clean.  Ordered congee, ying yang rice and dough fritter rice noodle rolls.   The congee was bland, perfect for the sickie. The dough fritter roll arguably one of the best I have ever eaten. The fritter inside was crispy so very fresh. On to the ting yang rice, I ate about a quarter of this dish and in that quantity there was a chicken bone and a shrimp shell. One of these things, okay it happens, but two? Very sloppy.  $32 tip in. Lots of leftovers obviously."}
{"text":"Amazing place.  Walked in and saw a lot of Chinese folks and knew that it would be good.  Huge menu, tasty food, service requires you to grab people as they fly by you but high recommend."}
{"text":"I go to Congee Queen almost every week, so when I heard that there was a new one opening I had to go. The whole place was decorated nicely, but the service was terrible. When I first walked in with my friends, no one came to seat us. Only when I walked up to someone did she tell us to sit. It was very noisy and it took forever for the waiter to ask us for our order. I must say that the food came quickly and as usual our meal was great. Congee Queen is still one of my favourite restaurants but I will be going to a different branch from now on."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  Typical Congee Queen quality, which is always a high standard. I don't come down to this location often, as the Highway 7/McCowan location is closer to where I live. However I was nearby so I decided to visit here instead.  This Congee Queen is a bit smaller than the other branches, but it's also not as busy (but still quite busy). There's more mandarin speaking people who come to this branch, for what it's worth.  I ordered the pad thai and the fried turnip patties. The pad thai is obviously not authentic, but for the price and portion (and honestly, quality as well) you get I'll gladly take it. Their fried turnip patties are one of their specialties, and I strongly believe that dish is done very well there. You can order it with red chili or not; I go without because I'm not spice tolerant. Again, their portions are big, to the point two dishes can probably fill three stomachs.  However, the clientele in this branch isn't as good as up north. I had a close call with a baby where their parents didn't bother controlling him, and the baby came very close to touching my teapot with his face while playing around on the booths...  Service is very good here. It's easier here to wave someone down since there's enough staff to cover the whole place."}
{"text":"Well, I've now officially been to 4 Congee Queen branches. Unfortunately I felt this place fell a bit short compared to the other three I've been to (McCowan, Steeles/404, Commerce Valley).  I went to this branch with some friends one night, as it was a more central location for some who live in the west end. Not surprisingly there was a lineup at around 6:30pm on a weekday, so the demand is definitely there for this branch.  We ordered the general tao chicken, shredded beef and preserved vegetable chow mein, fried beef noodle, fried turnip patties, and spice/pepper salt squid. All the noodle dishes were good, as well as the general tao chicken. However, the fried turnip patties were large in size and lacked the \"turnip\" texture, and the squid was too overcooked (overfried? too much batter/squid ratio).  Service was par for your typical Congee Queen, if not a bit lower. It was harder to get someone to take an order due to the less than spectacular setup here compared to the other branches.  I likely won't return to this branch as I've had better experiences in the other branches."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I actually think this is one of the best Congee Queens in Richmond Hill/Markham. Oh, it's also a Pokestop for those Pokemon Go addicts. Does that alone attract you enough?  Anyway...I came here to order some takeout, since I was nearby and didn't want to go all the way to the McCowan branch. I had their turnip cake and the chicken and shrimp pad thai. I did decided to eat some of the turnip cake inside, as I wanted to compare here and the McCowan branch.  I forgot to ask for no spiciness on the turnip cake, but to my surprise it was not spicy at all. Keep that in mind if you like chili oil, since I don't know if it was a mistake or if that's standard for this branch (McCowan branch doesn't hesitate on making it spicy). Regardless, the turnip cake was absolutely delicious. Portions were the same as the other branches (aka, a lot).  The pad thai was also very good, although for over $10 my standards increase a bit, and it's obviously not comparable to the authentic places downtown. Still good either way.  Service was attentive, and the servers certainly didn't mind that I ordered takeout but wanted to try some of the turnip cake before leaving. I did order a drink for dine in so it wouldn't be as awkward.  Will return if in the area."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Sure enough, that excellent service I had during the snowstorm last year was an one off. I went to Congee Queen tonight, and the service I had was nothing like that snowstorm day.  While we did get the order in rather quickly, we were quite peeved of the fact the servers kept placing our dishes to the edge of the table when we had a rather large table that was empty. Several times we had to move the dishes ourselves so everyone could grab it. Like, seriously? I can cut a bit of slack since service isn't a staple of Chinese-style restaurants, but even most Chinese restaurants I go to if they see a large table they would put dishes in the middle of the table instead of the edge.  Food is still good though, and they added even more items since I visited last time. I would gladly give this place 4 stars again if their service and hospitality improves."}
{"text":"The decor is nice! I like the tables and cutlery. The food is delicious. I go here once or twice a month. Specially when I am hungover, I always resort to their soup to restore me back to life. I recommend the wonton soup, chef's special rice, bbq duck and mango slushy WITH tapioca. Don't forget to ask for your fortune cookie at the end !  -Don't order take out. They serve you half of the portion of what it should be. You will be disappointed like me (only did it once)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Chinese food!   I absolutely love this place!   Service is always fast and friendly.  Congee Queen has a huge menu and lots of delicious options to choose from that range from vegetarian, seafood & fish to all sorts of meats! Portions are generous and everything I ever tasted from there was seasoned well."}
{"text":"Speedy service, many genuinely-unique dishes (some pics attached), most dishes are delicious coming in at all flavours, spacious table room, cutlery is standard and good.  Overall, it was a good experience. I would recommend coming here. Just be warned many dishes are fairly expensive."}
{"text":"I am so glad that Congee Queen finally opened a location in Mississauga.  I used to have to drive out to the East end of Toronto and Markham for this type of food.  The food at the Mississauga Congee Queen location is as good as their Commerce Valley Drive location and much better than their CenterPoint mall location."}
{"text":"It's a big busy place and the restaurant looks nice overall. The food is overall okay, not anything to call home about. The washrooms are pretty gross and the door handles definitely need a good disinfecting wipe down! The pricing is fair although probably a bit more than other restaurants within the area. I didn't find their milk tea and lemon tea as good either. I'd eat here again, but only if we were in the area."}
{"text":"I get takeout from this place and it's been great. The orders are quick (12-15 min for 4-5 dishes). The prices have increased in the last year, but the food quality is still pretty good. Whenever I feel like some Chinese food, this is my go-to place. The dishes that I typically order are turnip patties, Cantonese or chicken chow mein, beef with black bean sauce with thick rice noodle, general tao's chicken, congee, BBQ meat (bbq pork, roasted pork, duck, etc.) and eel fried rice. I've been to many other Congee Queen locations, and this is on par with them all. It's quite consistent which can be rare with such a large franchise. Their menu is so extensive that everyone is bound to find something they would like to eat.  While I'm writing this review, I'm thinking about how much I'll enjoy my leftovers tonight!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Congee Queen! 4.5 stars!  I can't believe that I haven't written a review until now. I guess because I go so often that it's just a go-to restaurant for my family and I. The Don Mills and Lawrence location is the best one compared to most others in the GTA.  Cantonese chow mein, turnip patties, fried squid, house congee, general tao's chicken, snow pea leaf, gai lan/Chinese broccoli, beef and broccoli, roast pork, BBQ duck, fish maw soup, hot and sour soup, soft-shell crab fried rice, eel fried rice...I can go on forever. All very flavourful, seasoned well, and very consistently so.  The atmosphere is fairly clean and spacious enough. Their service is very quick and the food is placed on your table after a few minutes of ordering. It gets busy on weekend evenings, so either make a reservation or prepare to wait a bit. You can always call to ask when their peak times are.  No question that I will be back for our next family gathering! They also sell gift certificates that can be used at any Congee Queen or Congee Wong."}
{"text":"My family and I just had dinner at Congee Queen this Saturday evening. We had to wait over an hour until the 5 of us were seated. By the time we were seated we were very hungry and tired from waiting. While we were waiting we were suggested to write down our orders. This sped up the process of ordering when we were seated.  We ordered the House Congee, fried rice noodle with beef in soya sauce, fried lobster with ginger and green onion, pad Thai, Cantonese chow mein, and rice noodle with shrimp and chives. Food came out super quick which is a plus after waiting so long! Every dish tasted delicious!   The only -1 was that the the spoon my sister had; had food on it. Since they're super quick at setting up tables they probably didn't notice the dirty utensil.  I don't think I've ever waited so long for Chinese food in my life. Next time I'll remember to make reservations (if they do take).   There's ample parking as it's in the Heartland Centre as well.  The 10% discount was a nice surprise!  I will be back but will probably get there earlier."}
{"text":"I usually come here for the Afternoon Tea Special (weekdays 3 pm to 5 pm). There are many options to choose from such as yeung chow fried rice, wonton noodles, and preserved egg/pork congee. A cold or hot drink comes with each dish that you order from the special menu. I usually get the cold Red Bean drink with ice cream on top. It's creamy and filling! You can also choose to get original milk bubble tea or hot drinks.    During my recent visit, we ordered Dumpling Noodles. It tasted similar to the wonton noodles. We were expecting pork dumplimgs but the dumpling filling consisted of a lot of shrimp and mushrooms. I would not order this again only because I am not a fan of shrimp. We also ordered deep fried pork chops which were very crispy and the breading was not too thick. The preserved egg and pork congee had a lot of meat in every bite which I liked.   The service is very prompt here and we always receive our dishes quickly. I would recommend this place for people looking for a quick, satisfying meal."}
{"text":"The food were rather salty. They add a lot of MSG. The servers didn't really speak a lot of English. They were sometimes confused as to what we were asking for. Aside from that, the portions (especially for the noodles/congee) were pretty generous (as all congee queens go). And the price is decent. Your average Congee Queen. At least it is convenient.   I would think twice again if I were to drop by here for some food, even if it is quick."}
{"text":"The service is pretty fast and the servers were helpful. It's a new location and the place is cozy. I went there for early dinner around 5:30 on a Friday and were lucky to be seated in a few minutes. There was a long line up after that.   The food is a typical Chinese restaurant but food presentation is nice. Love their empress fried rice and deep fried basa in secret sauce. I'll come back and try their fried chilli turnip patties."}
{"text":"Food is good but the staff are so unkind to none asians. Very poor discriminated service  They always take none asian people to sit on the  end side which nobody is there"}
{"text":"Not sure why Everyone loves this place, the chow mein is oily and greasy ... Veggies are over cooked   Hot and sour soup is salty"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years usually we have a set menu when we go there salt and pepper squid turnip patties which are mu favourite and of course you have to order Conger it is like almost mandatory I recommend tiger shrimp Congee absolutely delicious. I even tried their jellyfish which has a diiference texture to it.  They also have special items on a separate menu. Everytume I go there it gets so packed I suggest you make reservations . But definetly worth the wait and price"}
{"text":"Randomly stumbled upon this place.  I recommend the super congee w/ all the seafood in it.  I was not as big of a fan of the calamari.  It's very lightly fried and I'm used to really heavy/powerful flavors from fried squid and this relied more on the natural squid flavor.  In all, it was nice quick HK style meal and worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Walking into this Congee Queen for the first time; the decor is fancier than the other locations. Maybe the fancyness of this place has the front staff acting pompous... I'm not sure.    This place would have gotten a 1 star based on the type of service received... but the food was on point. Got the usual (the I don't need a menu, I already know what to order) - minced pork & fish w/ beans, crispy chicken, fried squid w/ spicy salt, cantonese chow mein.. ohhh and the BBQ pork.  BBQ pork was succulent. Crispy chicken, skin crispy, chicken juicy... veggies on other dishes not overcooked...  Have to say The. Food. Was. Goooood  If the food is always like this at this location - a tip for management/owners... Get rid of the front of house staff - servers, hosts. THEY SUCK. Let patrons sit themselves and order for  themselves, let the cooks get the credit they deserve and guarantee 4 and 5 star ratings will be the norm."}
{"text":"By far one of our most favourite restaurants in the city. The food is always consistently great and while the prices have gone up a little over the years, it is not enough to slow down our frequency of visits.   This time was simple takeout. The order consisted of two delicious congee dishes, one plain (conpoy) and the other with mushroom and bean curd, spring rolls, dough fritters, salt and pepper squid, and XO noodles with beef.  In terms of taste, the congee dishes were both excellent, seriously likely the best congee in the city. Usually we get the preserved egg and pork one which is my favourite but we went a little lighter in flavour this time.  Pairing the congee with the crispy \"Chinese donuts\", as has been done for thousands of years, is just phenomenal.   The spring rolls were good, and they tied me over until I got home.  Well I did save one as I am not a monster.   The beef noodles with XO sauce were exactly the same as the last time I had them and cooked just perfectly. Broad noodles, tender beef and a few other tasty bits makes it a very satisfying dish on its own with bold flavour coming through each bite.   And the spice and pepper squid nicely accompanied the noodles much like the fritters with the congee. Basically think calamari with a spicy twist.   Usually we go to the location by the don mills shops but the whole chain is great. So visit as often as you can and we might even see you there!  Hint:  we'll be the happy ones with the cleaned plates.    The salt and pepper squid are a nice crispy"}
{"text":"good place for dinner style foods and for fried rice and noodles. good portions"}
{"text":"Rather disappointing! Had scallop and tiger shrimp congee very bland. No seafood flavor whatsoever. And my friend stir fry noodle with beef was even worse. The beef is tender no texture and taste like cardboard. Instead of stir frying the noodle is piled up underneath the lousy sauce. It was overall an awful dining experience."}
{"text":"I always go with a group of friends and we order many items.  We have never been disappointed with any of the food or service.  Friendly, quick and affordable.  Loved the turnip patties and seafood congee!  I will have to check out the other locations in the future."}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is good when you find yourself on a vacation and returning to the same place twice. Some foodies might call this a big fat adventure fail, but I call this experience a delicious and delectable WIN.  The first night  we came in a group of 14. I ordered 2 bowls of their super sized congee, fried rice, and lo mein. We ordered the House special which is adorned with imitation crab and the duck and chicken congee.   The second day, we came during lunch and ordered the Seafood Congee and the duck and chicken congee yet again. We did it up big with roasted duck, roasted chicken served with deep fried chips, crispy chow mein, and a light and fluffy tasting deep fried squid. fried bananas for dessert. ZOMG. AMAZEBALLZ.  Now, I'm back home in the good ol' United States and all I want is one big delicious bowl of hot, silky smooth Congee.   Congee Queen, I miss you."}
{"text":"I had an exceptionally good experience here today for lunch. The server was very friendly and attentive.  The food was amazing. And this is in comparison to other congee queen/king/wong/roi/pharaoh places in the GTA. The Leslie-Finch location used to be my favourite, then the quality went downhill. Hwy 7 & east beaver creek is too packed. Don Mills & lawrence is a bit far with terrible parking. Yonge & cummer sucks. But this, this is the place to go.  Best versions of salt & pepper pork chops, mango shrimp & chicken, and pumpkin congee i've had in any of these places. You get the usual generous portions at great prices, but it's really the quality of the cooking that makes this location the best. Plus, theres always plenty of parking, good amount of space inside without having to squeeze with others (lots of booths), and little wait time to get seated.   My go-to congee place (until I get disappointed).  4 stars out of 5.  Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"one of my favorite restaurants. great price and service, top quality food. my favorite  dishes are spice and pepper  squid,  fried turnips, tiger shrimp congee , and the roasted pork."}
{"text":"Okay, I just want to start out by saying that the restaurant itself is very nice and the food is great. We ordered the pumpkin, crab and shark fin congee along with deep-fried shrimp wontons, they were fresh, hot and came out quick. The soup had stringy bits in it which I was not a fan of but other than that it was very pumpkiny, creamy and filled with crab chunks, great! However, i was beyond upset with how the staff treated myself and my sister, ignoring us for a half hour while we saw some servers returning to a single table two-three times and we had no one even come for a drink order. My sister spilled her tea and asked for napkins, still waiting on those napkins from a rude male server. We had to ask the hostess if we could order and she was the one who actually took our order, not a waiting staff member. We didn't even get water, talk about lame service. This was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in a restaurant. Shame on Congee Queen, I will never come back!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I still like congee Wong better. It is very big so it is good for groups and parties. They also have private rooms, which congee Wong does not have. As I was seated I noticed that the bowls and tea cups were filthy and stained with food. As being in many Chinese restaurants before, sometimes this is normal. They use a dish washer so sometimes they don't see it but the workers should be more aware as they are setting the tables and notice the dirty dishes. The food is alright, it's what Chinese MSG filled food is supposed to taste like. The night we came, it was hard to get service cause they were so busy. I don't think I would return here unless I'm invited here for another group party though."}
{"text":"Good portions for the price. I wish they would go easier on the onions though. The noodles and squid that I ordered were overloaded with onions. The bill totalld at just over 25 after tax but the meal was satisfying. Service left a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"3.5 stars! I love that there is finally a Congee Queen location in Mississauga and the Heartland area definitely needed a good Asian restaurant! I've been to the North York location a few times but this one is the nicer looking location. The lighting, sunlight coming in from windows all around, high ceilings with a nice design in the middle of the restaurant and the bigger restaurant space all made this a great experience. There are dozens of booths and tables all around. Yes, it's a bit loud and busy but that's all Asian restaurants on a weekend, especially on Christmas weekend!  Luckily, my friend's mom was able to get a number for us after she had finished dining in so we didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes upon arrival. The hostesses seemed overwhelmed as it was very busy at the front but again, it's expected for a new opening.  My friends and I ordered turnip patties, fried salt and pepper squid, cantonese chow mein, congee, sauteed greens and deep fried shrimp balls. We enjoyed all of the dishes - they were tasty with the right amount of seasoning for me and came in great portions. The dishes also didn't take too long considering it was very busy.  Service was decent overall. Staff were efficient and professional for the most part, minus the one server who kept trying to jam his cart past my friend's baby carrier on the ground despite clearly seeing it. Again, little things that didn't ruin the overall experience.   All in all, I recommend going here and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Clean place. Straight forward decor.  Consistent for quality.  I asked for beef rice rolls without cilantro. They did they couldn't do it cos the minced beef is premade.  I asked why they couldn't make new, or just use parts of their paste without cilantro, after all, a rice roll didn't need much beef filling anyway.  The just couldn't do that.  When the dish came, the cilantro was actually a while leaf with stem, added on top of the beef. That's disappointing that they couldn't leave cilantro out."}
{"text":"Good portion and affordable pricing. This place is always packed so make sure to make a reservation if you expect a bug group of people.  The ambiance is quite noisy so don't expect to have a romantic dinner there.  Food came very fast...almost only 5 mins after be ordered. Dinner for 6 people with 9 dishes for $131 with leftovers for next day.  Quite cold in the restaurant. ..we had to keep our jacket."}
{"text":"We've come here for late night dinner. Foods are good and service were ok. They accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food for a decent price. I love going to Congee Queen. Sometimes there can be quite a wait during dinner rush but there's a number system so you usually have an idea of how long you'll be waiting for. We ordered the Cantonese chow mein (with extra sauce) & general tao chicken. The general Tao wasn't really spicy so we had to add some chilli. Service was good."}
{"text":"It was my first time ordering from this restaurant. I had placed a small order for pick up and was told that the food would be ready and n 15 mins. I arrive about 25 mins later. I was barely greeted by the hostess and she didn't make eye contact. I told her I was picking up. She nodded her head in acknowledgment but proceeded enter checks into her system. After maybe a minute she asked how I was going to pay. I paid for the order, then she went to check if my order was placed among the other orders on the counter. After sifting through all of the orders she told me it's not ready yet and plopped her self back into her chair and continued on with whatever she was doing before I rudely interrupted her.   After about another 10-15 mins later my order was brought out and the hostess practically shoved to order into my hands. No thanks, no have a good day, nothing!  I reluctantly asked If there utensils because I thought she you attach me for bothering her too much but I did anyway. She nodded her head yes and then turn her back.   Honestly, usually things like that do bother me but As I was leaving this new and elegantly decorated restaurant I thought to myself \"well the food better be good\". Finally I arrived back at work and I open my container of the \"House Pad Thai\", at first glance I thought the presentation was appetizing but notice that there was a very small portion of peanuts which was disappointing to since I love them on my Pad Thai. I took my first bite and immediately I knew this will be an overall disappointment. It was very bland with hints of bitterness and sourness. The tofu was soggy but the chicken and shrimp were a little above mediocre.   Overall I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"Food is good. The place is very baby friendly. If you have a baby or toddler sleeping in the car you can order your food over the phone (pay cash or credit card over the phone) and they will take it to your car.   It is such nice customer service if you have have kids and just need to get some food home."}
{"text":"Prices have gone up. Food is still consistently good. But now you need to reconsider coming as you can have same food choices at lower prices."}
{"text":"I never post reviews on Yelp, but tonight I had one of the most unforgettable experiences in a restaurant: I found a dime (literally I found a coin) at the bottom of my Cantonese Chow Mein.   On the exterior, the restaurant is nicely decorated and appears clean. But there has to be serious sanitation issues in the kitchen if a coin somehow landed in my dish. Beware!"}
{"text":"This place was big and the menu extensive. The service was prompt and the food was good.   I really had a lot of problem selecting what I wanted as they all looked good.  Will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"I've been here too many times for when ever the chinese food cravings hit me.  The service can be pretty slow sometimes and I don't really enjoy the busyness of the restaurant but other than that, it is a good restaurant.  My must-haves at each visit are the empress fried rice and the fried turnips!"}
{"text":"My friends and i ate at congee queen on oct 15. Food was good but i was disappointed with the customer service. Water was dripping from the ceiling onto our table. The waiter pushed our table so it no longer hit our table but it was too late because it touched our food. The ceiling looked like it had a little mold so we lost our appetite and was upset we couldnt take it to go. Although the lady managing that night apologized she insisted our food was okay to eat. We felt she was trying to weasel her way out of giving us a discount. However we finally got them to remake two of the dishes. They also give us a free dessert and wow 10% discount for the trouble. Honestly, if she just apologized and offered to remake the food and give us better discount, i would write a better review.. if they gave us a free meal, i would definitely come back. After this incident and that mold in the ceiling...no thanks"}
{"text":"I used to go to the Thornhill location quite a bit. Now my family and I go to this location as it's much closer to us. I really like this congee queen as it's newer so the interior is cleaner and it's a bit more spacious and allows for more customers. My family and I arrived around 6:30 on a Sunday evening and we had to wait about 10 mins for a seat. We got fried rice, lobster, pork chops, green beans and tofu. All the dishes are usually consistent in taste and pretty good. The fried rice we usually have is the chef fried rice. We decided to try the Empress fried rice. To be honest I didn't really like it but I can see why it's so popular. The green onion and ginger lobster was delicious, the pork chops were okay, and the green beans were my favourite. I also had a Hong Kong milk tea which is really good here, it tastes like a true HK tea compared to the other ones. The service is always good here as there are tons of servers and you can always flag one down easily. I would recommend this location!"}
{"text":"It seems like despite Congee Queen having multiple locations, not all come equal or are the same. Yonge and Steeles is still my go to spot. I ordered pretty much the same items at this location as I always do and felt the meal was super salty. Also portions seem smaller. I prefer the chefs from the other location :)  One plus for them is that they have tons of tables. Perfect for large groups."}
{"text":"I am so glad this Congee Queen location opened up north as they have had much success in their other Markham locations with long wait times.  This Congee Queen is probably one of the larger ones with tons of seating, high ceilings and modern décor. The tables are very well spaced apart.  The service is quite fast and efficient even when it is incredibly busy on weekend nights.  The portions are food are huge for the price you pay, great for sharing; definitely my favourite chain of congee/Chinese fast food (over Congee Wong, Mr. Congee, etc). The menus offer a large variety of noodles, congee, appetizer dishes, etc with tons of pictures for those of us who prefer visuals.  Their desserts aren't bad either (and at a much more reasonable price than the Chinese dessert shops over at Times Square); I recommend the warm coconut milk glutinous rice and milk pudding!"}
{"text":"This place is full on weekday noon. No line up required, but almost fully seated.  We ordered Cantonese chow mein, which comes with assorted seafood meat and vegetable. There's lots of seafood meat and vegetable for the price of $14.95  Also ordered salmon congee, which contained so much salmon that I'm doubting how the restaurant can make money off of the $7.95 price point.  This is first time coming to this particular congee queen location. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is definitely not a bad place if you're into some decent Chinese food in the Cantonese style.    I came here on two occasions, once during the Sunday lunch rush and the second time during a quieter weekday night but my thoughts are still the same after having experienced Congee Queen on both occasions.  Here is the high-level summary.  Having come from Vancouver, BC where Chinese food can be found easily and is comparable to Hong Kong, I'm certainly a bit more comfortable sharing my comparisons.     PROS  Decor | the decor is pretty nice and decent for a chinese restaurant.  The tables are clean and certainly has some unique ceiling hangings and decor that you wouldn't normally find in an asian restaurant  Menu | very good menu selection - not too many dishes, not too little so definitely has enough variety   Price | decent price all around    CONS  Service | Service is pretty bad at this restaurant, even on a quieter weekday night - we had to flag down our server several times (not just once) throughout the night.  At times, I felt like I was in NYC trying to flag down a taxi driver in Times Square.  I've been to many chinese restaurants and the service level is certainly on the lower end  Wait | Wait times are pretty bad on a weekend so try to avoid this.   FOOD  In terms of the food, there were some hit and miss dishes.  We had the soft-shell crab friend rice which was okay and also this fried paste item (can't remember exactly what it's called but I've seen it reviewed in previous reviews below).  I wouldn't really call this amazing, but again, at the end of the day, it is a decent place to come to in terms of its clean decor and food quality."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places to get Chinese food in the city.  It's nice and open, clean and the menu is quite vast.  We got seated right away since we arrived right before the dinner rush (this was around 6pm).  We were greeted, which isn't something I'm used to when dining at a Chinese restaurant - they usually just point you to the table.  Yeung chow fried rice, spicy salt and pepper squid, beef and dough fritter rice noodle roll and general tao chicken was what we ordered.  PLENTY of food for us but the hubby took the leftovers for lunch the next day.  The quality and quantity of the food here is on point!  I didn't find any of the dishes overly greasy and they were all tasty.  When we were just about done there were quite a few people standing in the vestibule so I felt a little rushed since we had the little one with us.  They were basically cleaning up the table as we were standing up to put on our coats.  That's not really a biggie but perhaps they could have waited for us to be done completely before getting the table ready - they're super fast, anyway.  Overall, I truly enjoyed my dining experience here.  Quick, quality and quantity."}
{"text":"The food is okay. I found that they lacked a bit in taste and were on the oily side. It's a busy restaurant but the servers are attentive. I would go back for Chinese food but it doesn't stand out for me."}
{"text":"Not for the business traveler but could be OK for families.  Loud (like a cafeteria) with nondescript, OK food.  Staff didn't know what was included with the items.  Didn't hate it but won't be back even though I stay in a local hotel in walking distance."}
{"text":"Better than the Congee Wong in North York, seemed to offer more variety and the food tasted better. In a Western shopping plaza."}
{"text":"Thought it was excellent HK Cantonese food for the price, conveniently located at a Western plaza. Fried noodle dishes were excellent; would definitely go again if I wanted one-stop shopping plus Chinese food."}
{"text":"It is really nice inside, and I got a hoot from the place mat which told you precisely where to place the plate and bowl (not that the wait staff followed its directions).  We ordered several dishes to share -  Chilli Turnip Patties $5.50 Minced Beef Congee $4.25 BBQ Pork R.N. Roll $2.99 House Super Congee $9.95 (Large) Pork & Preserved Egg Congee $4.25 Soya Sauce Chow Mein $6.25 Fritter $3.20  For me, the stand out dish was the turnip patties (more like cubes) with its creamy inside and crispy outside.  Another diner however voiced that he would have preferred it fried up with more ingredients (ie. shrimp), instead of the mini tidbits that arrived adorning the turnip cakes.  Actually, that also caused me to deem this a four star spot.  Everything else was fine.  Oh, and the large congee is indeed LARGE."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall on Highway 7, we almost passed it by, but I had my eyes peeled.  Smartly lined on either side with mirrors, it isn't a large restaurant, but we were able to be seated immediately.  Everything we had was terrific.  The turnip cake cubes looked to be spicy, but looks can be deceiving, and they were nice and crispy.  The congee was pleasantly smooth.  Yep, we cleaned every plate.  Soya Sauce Chow Mein $6.75 Deep Fried Chicken Wing with Honey Garlic $8.50 Chili Turnip Patties $5.95 Dough Fritter Rice Noodle Roll $3.25 BBQ Duck, half $10.50 Stir Fried Pea Pod Stems with Garlic $12.99 Lai Wan Style Congee Large $8.75"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is our go to place to have family dinners these days as they tend to be very consistent at all their locations.  Ownership does a very good job to keep the quality the same and we've never had a problem before at any Congee Queen.    The menu is very extensive with a mix of Hong Kong fare of congee, noodles, rice dishes but also has some mix of Thai and Vietnamese cuisine as well, but best to stick with the classics.  Some favourites for us are the Big Bowl House Congee, Singapore fried turnip patties, Soya sauce chicken as well as the sweet and sour chicken.  Food always comes out fast and servers are quick to flag down.  Parking is limited to other plaza in spots in front but more parking found at the back.  There is often a long wait during the lunch and dinner especially on weekends so best to make a reservation to save some time."}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed this place.  I believe it's more of a 'classy' chinese restaurant, not the mom and pop shops.  Thank goodness the menu is in chinese AND english otherwise I'd be lost!   Every dish is a decent size.  I was with a large group so we ordered a lot. Congee was yummy along with the chicken chow mein (my fav!).  When I went it was full but we didn't have to wait for a table. Food came out fast after ordering and I was definitely satisfied."}
{"text":"Eat in or take out, always satisfied. I order delivery for when i have people over, everyone loves the food.  They are very consistant with the flavor.  I always order Cantonese Chow Mein, House Super Bowl Congee, Fried Rice Noodle with Beef, Beef Brisket Rice, Spice & Pepper salt squid, salmon fried rice,  fried chili turnup, and surprise dish is... Deep fried chicken wings. These dishes are always consistant.   Only downside is the parking lot, get there early."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner today, congee time yesterday, and I'm a regular at congee Wong.  Food here good, isn't amazing tho..  Overall my opinion is, Congee Wong is the best!!  Ordered the usual items..  Stir Fried Turnip Cake - 2 stars because they were stingy on the shrimp, pork, egg, and xo sauce   Seafood Congee Bowl - 3 stars because it was original flavour - not over powered by MSG but didn't have enough seafood  Ordered 3 types of rice rolls (plain, Chinese donut with beef, and shrimp) - 4 stars because the rice cake was well made but not the best..  Stir Fried Smooth-Beef Flat Rice Noodles - 2 stars because they were stingy on the beef and had no green peas in the dish at all..   Now, everything was ordered didn't have much oil in it, which means it won't taste as good, but less oil is great for better health.. Also didn't taste much MSG which is also good for health..  And like most comments I made previously, they were stingy on the meats and veggies.. Which sucks..  Overall, portions should be big in these types of restaurants and his place didn't disappoint.  Overall 3 stars because the food was authentic and wasn't oily!! The only reason why I would come back here.. But the again how fried chicken taste if it wasn't deep fried?  Didn't get a chance to try any of the fried rice dishes but looking all the tables.. Seems like it's not oily either, which is good for health!!   Price was a bit higher relative to the expected norm.."}
{"text":"Bought half a BBQ duck and half soya chicken tonight for take out. Really bad, no taste at all for both. And the BBQ guy was too lazy to chop the duck and chicken , I end up having 8-9 cube of meat in each container. Their BBQ meat went downhill. It used to be good . Now it's no better than those BBQ meat sold in Chinese grocery store but cost double here."}
{"text":"Solid traditional Chinese food. Restaurant is clean and spacious. Service was efficient and could speak mandarin.   Highlights:  Fried tofu Stir fry beef (tender and flavorful) Beef with noodles Shrimp dumplings (excellent) Roast pork"}
{"text":"3.5*, but rounded up for friendlier-than-usual-Chinese places.  Food arrived quite FAAAST!    Since it's essentially a fast food Chinese place, you will need to flag someone down.  So don't expect service to be super attentive!  Our main waitress was friendly, the other 2 younger people looked like walking zombies, but I wasn't offended.  Since there was someone who was vegetarian in our group, we ordered:  Mushroom & 6-grain congee (\"healthier\"), Chinese doughnut stick, Mixed Veg Chow Mein, & Salt & Pepper Bean Curd (deep fried tofu cubes).  The weakest of the dishes was the deep fried tofu cubes that had the fried wok taste, BUT absolutely no seasoning - no S&P!  Everything else was pretty good, including the veg congee which I initially had reservations about.  Constructive Criticism:  Chow Mein wasn't crispy enough.  It was served on a platter with rounded edges to contain the sauce and since it wasn't that crispy to begin with, how it was served made it even LESS crispy as time went on.  For 4-ppl, with some leftovers, it came out to just over $30, so pricing was good.  Although prices obviously depends on the dishes your order.  The Snow Pea Shots with some goji berries, so veg, was $15 a plate!  If you look through the menu, average price/family-style plate seemed to be around $15.  I'd definitely go back, but maybe replace the Mixed Veg Chow Mein with reg Canto-style and S&P Tofu with fried piece of fish, squid/calamari, & those Fried Chilli Turnip Cakes!!!"}
{"text":"I never expected much from Congee Queen after trying their Steeles location over a year ago. I found their food plain and whenever my parents proposed the idea of returning, I always rejected it. However, my family wanted to celebrate a special occasion and I was willing to go wherever my mom wanted to go because it was her celebration.   She chose this location of Congee Queen. Upon arrival, I was instantly pleasantly surprised at the set up of the restaurant. There's a beautiful centerpiece lamp. My family got seated at one of the cozy circular booths. My parents ordered lobster, fried rice with fried scallops, general tao chicken (I think that's what it was), clams, and turnip patties. There was another disk that we got, but unfortunately I cannot recall. For the 6 dishes feeding 5 adults, it was a bit under $100 after taxes. The food wasn't as bland as the Steeles location, and the decor is really pretty. Washrooms are also nicely set up too. I definitely recommend this location. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"So glad I was finally able to come to this joint. The bbq peking duck was legit! The skin was seasoned perfectly and moist inside."}
{"text":"Noodles were soggy and lacking in taste.  Service was lacking as well.   Drinks were watered down.   Soft shell fried rice was sad...cheap on the crab.   Restaurant is nice and spacious. Decor is modern."}
{"text":"I came here on my way back to the city and the food was very salty. Besides that, the calamari was very crispy tasting. I was surprised they used bell peppers instead of jalapeños."}
{"text":"First time at a Congee Queen, they had a variety of selections. I didn't really know what to get because everything sounded good. They had a specials excerpt and my mum wanted to try the vegetarian fried rice which ended up being better than the shrimp fried rice we also ordered. We also ordered duck which of course was amazing. As a drink I got a milk tea! It's so nice to have a choice of boba/tapioca in a restaurant setting. Good food, good company, it was also not that expensive! We went on a Friday night which was busy! Even if they were busy, our wait time was 30 minutes or less. Not bad at all for a Friday night. Lots of parties coming and going. I'm glad I got to try this place while I was visiting Ontario. They were very busy that every time we wanted to order we had to get someone's attention. Luckily we were sat next to the entrance where there were people who could assist us. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Huge Congee Queen but there's still a wait on the weekends because of the busy location. This one's decor is quite grand with a huge light ball in the middle of the restaurant.   On this visit they actually forgot about our order. Possibly a product of them being so busy. When we told them about it they were pretty quick about figuring what happened. Our food consisted of the seafood fried rice and the mango chicken and shrimp. The seafood rice was fried rice with baby shrimps, scallops and thinly sliced squid strings. Kind of lacking in the flavour department. The chicken and shrimp dish was really good. The shrimp and chicken are battered and covered in saucy deliciousness.   Just a note that this Congee Queen has a menu to order build your own noodle soup which is unique from the other locations!"}
{"text":"This location, as with all the other Congee Queens, is normally pretty busy. They do offer table sharing with randoms if there is a wait but you can opt to wait for a private table. Interestingly this location has lunch menu deals that are of the item + rice variety. We got the seafood chow mein and the turnip cakes. The sauce was thoroughly mixed in so there were no crunchy parts of the noodle unfortunately. The the turnip cakes were kind of bland. I expected a lot more spice and flavour for this dish."}
{"text":"I visited this location today for lunch. The three of us ordering the shrimp wonton soup to start thing was delicious and flavourful. We then ordered spicy squid, seafood Cantonese chow mien, shrimp fried rice and a mixed vegetable dish. Everything was delicious with big portions, the only down side was the spicy squid which was chewy and hard to get through. I will be coming back for the food, but not for the service, very slow and we were ignored for much of the meal."}
{"text":"This is the best of the Congee Queens located in Toronto.  The food is always well cooked, the staff are very helpful, although they rarely smile, but they are good at their job, no order mess ups and they will gladly replace an order if u want."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Toronto, I have to eat here! The food is always fresh, flavorful, and high quality. I've tried different dishes and I like them all! I always come with my sister and her family so we can order a lot of dishes and taste more. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place to go for a family lunch or dinner for Chinese food!  Their menu is gigantic (I'm not kidding, there's easily something for everyone), prices are pretty reasonable when you consider how much you get and the food is extremely quick to come out after you've ordered (even if they're very busy).  Congee Queen itself is pretty clean too.  The waiters/waitresses are pretty nice - just keep in mind that not all of them speak perfect English.  They also do take out!  Yummy food and in containers that you can keep and re-use.  I kinda wish they'd put the food that's ready to be picked up near the front desk though because lining up near the cashier at the back can get somewhat crowded.  One word of warning is that it gets very busy around 6-7:00pm on any given day and while the place isn't small, it still fills up quickly - this goes for the parking spaces as well.  So if you don't like waiting, go early."}
{"text":"This will probably be my last time eating at this place. I honestly don't get the hype and the massive line ups. There are far better and cheaper options for Chinese food. This place is just lucky that they are located at a mall with many apartment buildings = residences nearby. We came at around 6:30 on a Wednesday night so we beat the crowd but once it hit 7 bam! line ups..   Anyways, after we were seated, it was pretty hard to get waiters to attend to us to take our order as they were super busy running around and ignored us many times. When we were finally able to get someone, I was double checking with my dad to confirm the clam congee if that was what we wanted to order and the waiter thought we weren't ready and just ran off. I thought that was pretty rude as she didn't even stay for more than 2 seconds because we just weren't worth their time I guess. Luckily I flagged down another staff as he delivered food to the table beside us. The guy at the table beside us (single guy) tried to tell him that the food that came was wrong, and the waiter was rude enough to give him a disgusted look and ignored him to come attend to us without sorting it out with him first. It seemed like he was relieved we needed to order so he didn't have to deal with the wrong order. We ordered a ying yang fried rice, clam congee and fried Chinese doughnut wrapped in rice roll. The waiter didn't even bother confirming our order and I had to confirm with him if he got our order right after seeing what had happened to the table beside us. After taking our order, the waiter attended back to the table beside us and the guy was nice enough to say \"it's fine\" and just accept it without making a fuss or sending the order back. Funny thing to me was, the waitress that took his order came around and recognized that the order was wrong and asked him what happened because the order that came wrong costs more she told him. She  apologized which was nice of her, but I would've expected her to offer to adjust the price back the original order (cheaper price) and or give him some sort of discount to make up for their mistake but no so that was that.   So our food came, clam congee came pretty fast but came in a tiny bowl (that was not how it was shown in the picture) which costed $8.99. The congee was extremely thick like a paste. I don't know what happened but I did see another yelp review commenting about the same thing. I thought their specialty was \"congee\". I've definitely never tasted thick congee like this before. You can find far better congee for way cheaper. Not worth the hype at all, how misleading! Next came the Chinese doughnut in rice roll, it was just meh, very typical. The ying yang fried rice took the longest and we were practically done the congee and the rice roll before the fried rice arrived. When it finally came, I get why some yelpers said the portions were big, it's because the sauce was spilling everywhere, all over the dish onto the sides and everything. It made a huge saucey mess and not presentable at all. The fried rice was super hard, you could feel the middle of the rice was not cooked through and some even got stuck in the cracks of my teeth. The red sauce had some smelly towel/mop smell which caused my tastebuds to taste that as well. It was quite smelly and sour. Overall, very disappointing dish for $12. I dare any of you to order that if you do must pay a visit and see for yourselves what tasting a dirty towel/ mop tastes and smells like. You will understand what I mean for sure, I guarantee you. Their menu I would not call it cheap either! Save your money and go elsewhere where your dollar can take you farther for much better treatment. The only thing I could really give them credit for is that the bathrooms were decent (not too dirty) for a rather busy Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Other than the service being sucky.... the food is GREAT. Huge portions and a huge variety. A few dishes that stand out as favourites are: Seafood Vermicelli, Salt and Pepper Squid, Cantonese ChowMein as well as the BEST SHRIMP WONTON SOUP EVER. Do make sure you make a reservation because it is always busy!"}
{"text":"Really good family place! The wait may be long i.e. minimum 25 minutes wait, but the food service is fast!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday BEFORE lunch hour.... And there was already A LONG wait.... This place is bigger than any of its other locations, but someone is always around you to help or serve you and they are friendlier than the ones at other locations. Maybe the diverse clientèle has something to do with it. Food sure arrives in a timely matter and they taste good. Being the only restaurant of its kind, fair price for what you get, and what you get is very tasty, no wonder there is such a long wait all the time. Definitely will come back to try other dishes, again."}
{"text":"Super yummy place with innovative ideas on traditional Chinese dishes. I love the blend of Asian with a twist of fusion.   Dinner for 5 is shown in the photos. We had a mixed veggie dish with acorn squash, lotus root, celery, carrots, wood ears etc, salt n pepper fish, mango beef on a hot plate, a mushroom and barley fried rice which gave it s crunchy, slightly chewy texture that was amazing with hot sauce! Afterwards, we had a pineapple freeze and a black rice with coconut milk to complete the meal. Both were perfect! The freeze was not too sweet and the black rice was served warm n thick.   Service was great in the sense they're friendly and food came quickly but their not good about checking in on you after the food arrives."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this location plenty of times and each visit has brought similar experiences. The food is consistent and comes out pretty quickly. However, the short time it takes to bring out food makes me question the freshness of the dishes. The service is significantly below average; the waiters bring food and then leave, never to been seen again. I docked one star for this because when dining out, customer service is extremely important and has the potential to make a horrible meal very good and vice versa.  We always order the seafood medley congee which has strips of ginger I'm not a fan of but it doesn't disappoint. The noodles all have a similar flavour and trust me when I say this, once you've tried one noodle dish, you've probably tried them all. One surprising discovery for me was that Congee Queen's sweet and sour chicken is not good at all. I've ordered lemon chicken various times and it is quite good. The turnip patties and salt and pepper squid are two dishes I always go back to. I like the milk pudding tofu as well.  If you decide to pay a visit, be prepared for terrible service. It always takes us at least two attempts to flag down servers, or ask for plates and/or water. On one occasion, we paid the bill, wanting change back so we could add additional money for the tip but we never got any change back. After the extremely long wait, we just gave up and left. Oh well, their loss anyways."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with family and everyone was pretty impressed! We made a reservation in advance (not sure if that even mattered). There was a huge lineup that kept growing as the evening went on but luckily there was a table for our party size.   Overall service was quick and food was delicious. Our favourites included the Empress Fried Rice, Mixed Fungus & Fried Gluten hot pot, and the Spice & Pepper Salt Squid. It was a bit of a drive for everyone but we were all full and content with the meal. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"OK and nothing more.  Uninspiring and lacking personality.  Have had better dining experiences and better jjeok.  If they were in HK, people would not be running to eat there.  Ho hum ..."}
{"text":"I've been to this location 2 times.  I'll give 3.5 Stars out of 5.  there service is OK, i think they cater to you better if you speak their language but if not then they come off rude.   Example, Excuse me sir can i order a Sprite please? No too busy!!! LOL  there's not really a set server for you they're just spread all around and helping out where need be.    if you go there when they're busy and when there is a lot of ppl in front of the desk it's really a pain in the butt to get your reservations done let alone make sure you're being serve within a reasonable amount of time.  Once you wait and get seated, you go the thru the menu and you're ready to order then you will have to flag down a server to take your order.  the food here is really good A+ in the quality of Congee and Cantonese chow mein.  their deep fried fritter dough is tad bit over cook but i'll eat it anyways.  the menu has a lot of really nice dishes and looking forward to trying out new dishes.  Prices are fairly high but if you stick to just eating congee then it's really cheap.  definitely will get a repeat business on these cold winter days but i wish they can get their customer service up or they will definitely lose out on good TIPS."}
{"text":"Nice clean atmosphere!  Food was delicious and price was reasonable for the large portions they provide.  We ordered the following:  wonton soup - 3/5- soup base had a lot of msg but the wonton skin was thin and there was a shrimp per a wonton  house special eel fried rice - 5/5 this was pretty much everyone's favorite and the flavor was delicious  shrimp walnut with mango salad - 4/5 this was delicious but not enough shrimp  deep fried turnips- 3/5- this was good but a bit dry, was expecting hoisin sauce on the side  Overall, definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"NYC girl venturing out to Canada in hopeful to find the best wonton noodles and congee. Made a stop here after doing my research on yelp and this is what my group and I ordered:   Sliced Fish Congee - great value but lacked flavor  Shrimp Wonton - shrimp was tender, soup was delicious Fried Chili Turnip Patties - very good Empress Fried Rice - not much eel and crabmeat Mayo shrimp - not worth the price   Overall, I would come here again for their shrimp wonton and turnip patties. BTW, I love their ambiance!!"}
{"text":"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a decent experience. Parking was available behind the restaurant and the restaurant was packed upon arrival at 5:30 pm. The wait for a table was ~30 minutes. There are a few seats, in addition to standing room by the door.  Started off with the jelly fish which was decent. Portion was generous and the flavoring was on point.  Moved on to the Snow Pea Leaves in garlic sauce that was ok. Vegetables were decent and flavoring was okay. Portion was generous.  The Cantonese Chow Mien was huge with a generous crispy fried noodle portion along with tons of chicken, pork, bbq pork, and prawns.   Highlight of the meal was the Diced Sirloin with Chili Black Pepper in Golden Bowl. Plenty of tender pieces of sirloin cubes in a fried wonton shell that was quite tasty.   Staff was rather frazzled due to the large crowds.  ~$18/head after tax and gratuity for tons of food!"}
{"text":"I usually only order take out here only as it can get very busy. The staff are super fast and efficient. I prefer this location over the others as the food seems to be slightly better. I know they serve the same things but I definitely noticed some subtle differences with our usual dishes.  Love the plain congee, fried rice, noodles, etc. Highly recommend the  H1 - Empress Fried Rice H9 - Seafood with Dry garlic Fried Rice E3 - Cantonese Chow Mein - if you're ordering take out, tell them to separate the sauce! K35 - minced pork with green beans  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Finally went to the new Congee Queen. It was easy to find. Situated close to Pickle Barrel/No Frills. Or for those who are more familiar with the separate plaza across, across from Beer Store/Timmys/Baskin Robbins.   Lots of space when we entered here on Saturday evening. We ordered...  E4 Taiwanese Vermicelli -  This was a bit dry and a tad bland.   K47 Crab Meat Seaweed Salad -  It looked very impressive in the photos but it didn't taste that good. Maybe they could add more mayo. I've had much better crab meat salad before. Also there was very little seaweed in there. Unless cucumbers count as seaweed.   K53 Fried Chili Turnip Patties -  Bland. Usually you can taste the spice. The turnips were cut quite large.  K38 Fried wings w/ garlic -  It was ok. I still think Kenny's delight is better. But it tasted better a day later. Too sticky with the honey.  K17 Snow pea leaves w/ garlic sauce -  This was probably the best dish. Very tasty and just perfection. But it better be for $12.99  K22 General Tao chicken -  Disappointing. I liked this dish more at 'fake' Chinese restaurants. Portion was a bit small.   It was ok but I prefer the location and standards of the 404/Steeles location better."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat - cheap, quality, and you get quite a lot of food for the price! They have a selection to choose from, from Chinese BBQ to rice dishes, pho, and more."}
{"text":"They made the white rice congee ahead of time and add the ingredients after ppl ordering it, the taste of congee and meat is not combined nicely."}
{"text":"Wow! The food is out of this world good. We ordered on Easter Sunday and I have never seen such a crowd!! People were stuck in the revolving doors and once you got inside there was literally no space to move. We were so glad we got our food to go; the wait times for dine-in must have been insane. Anyways, back to the food! Do yourself a favour and get the House Fried Rice, so tasty!! We also got the Szechuan Chicken, Black Bean Beef, Salt n pepper squid, Soft shell crab fried rice, the Taiwanese vermicelli fried noodles, Chow Mein, Lobster HK style, Deep Fried Seabass (so buttery!!) and the Chicken & Shrimp with mango. Everything was really delicious!!! It kinda reminded me of the food at Congee Dynasty which is closed now. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Want decent Chinese food? Want large portions? Want 10 different types of congee? If yes, then come here. Quick service with prices ranging from $6+ congee medium-sized bowls to $11+ rice/noodle dishes. The prices vary on what kind of items you want in the food. Way better than Chinese fast food. Large place with tons of seating with tons of free parking.   Go for: cheap congee with fast parking, seating, and service   Don't go for: fanciness"}
{"text":"I rate Chinese restaurants based on the quality of their Cantonese chow mein. It's my all time favourite dish. This is y go to when ever I craving it. I've been to other Congee Queens, but they also don't match up to this location. Wish it wasn't so far from where I live. When you come here, Cantonese chow mein  is the must try!"}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Cantonese restaurant in this neighbourhood. Just like other congee queen, fast, great price, delicious. Especially want to compliment the BBQ pork section, great roast!"}
{"text":"Food is decent and the dishes are big. The only bad thing is you need to wait for a long time every time."}
{"text":"This location was interesting as the food was subpar for some reason.  The congee we ordered was bland and literally had no taste.  There was either no salt added or just a pinch...  a very small pinch. The stuff in the congee was also bland.  The tripe should have been at the very least salty and spicy.  The Empress Fried Rice was anything but.  The rice was not fried but just flash heated in a wok (I cook so I can tell when someone skimps),  the soy sauce was inadequate and it lacked salt.  The broad noodles with beef?  ;-)  You guessed it!  Bland with a very teeny bit of salt.   They must have either run out of salt or they ran out of veteran short order cooks. My dad was a short order cook and he was really good at that.  I'll give this place a try at a future date...  Maybe in 2099 when my taste buds no longer exist.  :-P  Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time at this location. So far the only detraction is the noise level. Noise level is quite high for a place like this. Only other place with a high decibel level is Mandarin on Eglinton and Warden.  Will write more as I eat more ;-)"}
{"text":"Congee Queen is your run of the mill franchised restaurants among many in the Richmond Hill area. Typically, I come here for their congee which I find slightly better than your average fare in the area. Besides that dish, there really isn't much that puts Congee Queen in the lime light among the sea of choices in the Markham/Richmond Hill area. However, if you are looking for standardised chinese dishes and expect a consistent quality without breaking your bank, Congee Queen is a solid choice."}
{"text":"We ordered 6 plates and i loved one....not a great batting percentage.  Whats worse was it was freezing.   It's so cold!   I felt that the AC was on or there was a portal to the North Pole open; cant decide.  On the plus the waiter was good and quite friendly."}
{"text":"The good thing about Congee Queen is it's always consistent, fast, tasty and usually short waiting times even during peak hours because their restaurants are massive and sit a ton of patrons. They also are very efficient, bringing in guests, seating them, bringing out their food, and shooing them out.   The decor of this Congee Queen is really nice, as with most of them. Don't expect high quality service, this is normal with almost all Chinese restaurants. In terms of family-style Chinese food, Congee Queen is definitely one of the most popular restaurants because there are a lot of them and they're all consistently quite good.  I'll always come here when my family wants Chinese food, but I'm interested in discovering other Chinese restaurants that are similar to Congee Queen with better food."}

{"text":"Yummy salt squid...so so pad thai but gorgeous in appearance. I think it lacked flavour n it tasted artificial sauce wise. Cantonese chow mean was yummy yet couldn't help but think that it too had an artificial tasting flavour in the sauce. Beef sizzling plate was nice. Over all nothing to write home about. Its nicely decorated also has a cased in duck n BBQ room . A little music would have been nice to drown out the kids and general kitchen noise. Customer service is one of the worse I've ever encountered. No hello no greeting just a stoned faced person w a samurai expression asking if we know what we want. At the end my husband gave the wait person a $50 n $20 dollar bill to pay the $53. Dollar bill and gave him $7 in change.  My husband had to ask her for the other $10  Will I go back? Nah...this was a test run.  Dismal customer service"}
{"text":"The new Congee Queen presents Chinese congee/noodle cuisine a new modern twist. There's traditional dishes like the standard congee offerings but also offers new dishes with a bit of fusion with western and pan-asian cuisine."}
{"text":"Its only 'good' by Mississauga standards.  Decor was nice and place was big.  Portions were small, trying to get fancy with the plating but adds no value.  Ordered some fish dishes where they were not fish fillet (good) but its the cheap frozen fish portions...with lots of bones (bad), rather go back to the fish fillet.  Lobster Efu noodles had no taste.  We sent it back because the middle was frozen.  Went to eat at Filipino food court next door afterwards."}
{"text":"What a great place..good food, fast service even when busy..price was descent..I go here every time I visit Toronto"}
{"text":"Very good service, food is amazing. My favorite is the turnip patties. And the salmon congee. The lobster is good here too"}
{"text":"Had the sweet and sour pork with a side of chicken congee. I don't usually come to this location but it was opened a bit later than the other congee queens in the GTA. This location closes at 12 am and I believe that the kitchen closes at 11:30 pm. The sweet and sour pork is the average where you would usually get from any other restaurant. The chicken congee had way too much MSG. Usually congee is appetizing for the stomach but instead it made me feel a bit sick. The seating inside of congee queen is very comfortable. I really liked the customer service they provided. I was asking my friend for a napkin while a waitress was walking by and I guess she over heard and brought a bunch of napkins which was very thoughtful of the waitress. But even if the customer service is amazing I probably won't go out of my way to come to this location especially if I want a good bowl of congee."}
{"text":"Woah , lets talk about fancy.  so this place had some upscale decorations going on, it was beautiful. this place has been open for sometime but it was still busy.  I wouldn't go here for a date, but more like a family dinner, or a group of friends.   it is def sharing style, so order a bit of whatever and share with your group, it is the best way to experience this type of restaurant.  The food was good, and of course more upscale in presentation comparing to the average Chinese cuisine.  I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Very good price with very good quantity! Guangdong style food.. love their fried dough! Been here a few times with my friends and we will definitely come back. Lots of people when we were there and the waiting time is not a problem. Dishes are prepared pretty fast. I am pretty satisfied overall"}
{"text":"I think his name is Carmen. He recommended us the shrimp dumplings instead of our usual shrimp wontons. He was amazing! I just found out he is a trainee and honestly I would come back JUST to be served by him. THANK YOU CARMEN!"}
{"text":"Love love loveee this place! amazing fried dough, called youtiao's great with congee! The fried turnips weren't as good as the last time i can but overall the food was pretty good, highly recommend the beef stir fried noodles as well"}
{"text":"I've been to Congee Queen quite a few times already and I'll tell you that it's the thought of that delicious seafood congee that keeps me coming back for more.  My boyfriend and I decided to come on Christmas Day, since we had all the turkey we could eat the day before. We needed a change!  Let me start off by saying that I don't think I've ever seen a restaurant of this size have so many people waiting to be seated and actually waiting probably 15 minutes tops at a time. The turn around in this place is insane.   We were seated right away, unfortunately not far from the entrance. As I said, there was a non-stop influx of hungry customers coming in, so that cold wind kept hitting us. We asked if there was any way to switch seats. As the restaurant was super packed, there were none available except for a table right next to us that was blocking the entrance door by a wall. So, all was well with that.   We ordered the super bowl seafood congee, which is MASSIVE. Definitely meant to be a whole meal for two or to be shared by a bunch of people. We also got salt and pepper squid, which was a bit too salty at time..but we were warned in the name. We got a mushroom and beef stir fry, which was delicious (I loved the onions and the mushrooms were pretty big). And finally we also got a vegetable stir fry, as my boyfriend really wanted bok choy.   There was obviously no way we could ever finish that amount of food, but we did our best. Whatever was leftover, we brought Home as it was too good to waste.   The wait for the food was a bit longer than usual, but given how busy they were it was actually a lot faster than any other restaurant probably would've had. We were so full and happy, that it was a great way to end our Christmas Day! I love this place and will keep coming back for that congee craving."}
{"text":"Fair pricing, great selection of chinese food, congee, duck, fried rice, chow mein. The bbq pork was soft and a bit wet, I was hoping for more grilled and a bit more crispy."}
{"text":"Update!!   Dinner We got the salt bass, the fin shark, pad Thai and shrimp wonton.  Yummy.  Highly recommend. The wait time is much better now."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the fanciest Asian restaurants I've been to in a while. Walk in and the place blows you away with its large space and huge ceiling mosaic to match!  The place has only been open for about 3 months but the lines to wait are still wild. We had originally called to book for 6:30 but they only had reservation times for 7:00. When we got there we only had to wait 5 min yes before we got in.  The staff is pretty much the same as any other Asian restaurant - you'll have to wave them down to get their attention and they look pretty monotonous when taking your order. However, the fast service and food made up for it. Make sure you get congee while you are here!   Would I go back? Definitely with a large group of friends. It's a perfect upper class atmosphere to impress while also giving out the loud and vibrant vibes of Asian eating."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a while, and I'd have to say the best things here that I always order are:  - the sliced cube beef in the crispy golden bowl - BBQ DUCK! - taro slush with tapioca!! - beef brisket noodle in soup - bbq eel fried rice  - fried rice noodle with pork chop in black bean sauce  - All the congee!  It's rare that I order something new that tastes bad :)   And everything is very reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Very good food! Love this place.  Been a long time since I have been there.  Was there on a sunday...super busy! But they seated me pretty quick.  Ordered the Chinese Broccoli, the General Tso Chicken and the Schechuan Beef.  Chinese Broccoli was crunchy, tasty and fresh as I remember it to be.  The Schechuan beef was very tender, melts in your mouth practically and came with onion, green and red pepper.  Very good!!!!  The general chicken tso wasn't to my liking so I will never order that again.  Too sweet for me.  Best place for General Tso chicken is Cest Bon!  Otherwise, this place is still really good but double the price.  I will be returning as its worth it."}
{"text":"Now I've known and enjoyed their fierce competitor Congee Wong but heard such good reviews about the great Congee Queen (CQ) Empire that I decided to try out this new place for lunch.  This place is huge (about 100 seats) and very modernly decorated with high ceilings, ikea style chandeliers, a chinese bbq station, and a huge fish tank.  Their menus are chocked full of gorgeous pics of their dishes which almost made me salivate on the menu.  The lunch specials are inexpensive and for $6.99 and up you get a choice of main dish with rice including hot and sour soup and a spring roll.   The roll was nice and crunchy with some veggies inside.  The hot and sour soup was much better than many restos I've been to and made with the all the works.  Main course I got was the roast pork with rice.  This was some of the best roast pork I've had (almost as good as Congee Wong at FMP).  For 6.99 you can't go wrong!  Service was prompt and fast (i guess for the rush lunch crowd).   Will def try this place for dinner."}
{"text":"Congee Queen at Yonge/Steeles is one of my frequent go-to's for lunch.  Although I find their decor a bit on the tacky side, they do a decent job on their BBQ meats and snack type dishes. For actual congee itself, it's also alright, although I find Congee Wong down at Yonge/finch to have tastier congee (and around a dollar cheaper on average).  Being at a Chinese restaurant, you are expected to flag down any servers instead of having someone check on you every once in a while - not really an issue, however the restaurant is a bit on the big side and servers tend to congregate around the cashier area, so people sat at the corners and sides tend to have a hard time flagging down servers for ordering and getting the bill.  Overall, Congee Queen is an acceptable restaurant, and prices are relatively affordable. Just don't expect anything mind-blowing."}
{"text":"Really delicious. I tasted my first bowl of congee here, and it was pretty good. I don't remember most of what my family and I ordered, but I do remember it was really really good. It was really busy when we went so I imagine it's a popular place to go to, and I can see why. I will definitely come back some time."}
{"text":"The food is always good here no matter what you order on the menu. I'm also impressed at how quickly the food is served after placing an order."}
{"text":"Huge selection of food. Everything is good. Fast service. Great prices! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"There was so many different congees to choose from as well as other dishes. The food was surprisingly good considering it is a congee restaurant. The congee was very flavourful and filling. One of the top congee places out there.   The restaurant itself is really nice. The waiters were friendly and the atmosphere is nice. It wasn't busy on a Friday afternoon as the restaurant is really big.   I would recommend this to a friend! They have a large menu and a lot to choose from. I would definitely revisit and come back often."}
{"text":"Bring your reading glasses. I'd say this easily wins the most extensive menu in the world award. 12 or so pages of items, along with an extra 3 or 4 pages with Daily, monthly, and I guess Super Super specials.  With so many items, it's hard to get them all right, so the place has lots of 5 and 4 star dishes, but they're mixed in with very average dishes. With the right fine tuning, one can really get their money's worth here."}
{"text":"The good: * Fried Chili Turnip Patties (diced turnip patties stir fried with shrimp, chicken, pickle and egg) - fan favourite.  * Beef Tendon/Beef Brisket Noodle in Soup - Big chunks of beef with delicious \"mein\" noodles in a flavourful broth. * Fried Squid - Big chunks of squid, battered lightly with salt and pepper.  * Fried rice - big shrimps!  The meh: * Their congee is super thick and flavourless. I like mine thin and well, flavourful.  * Beef and gai lan. Pretty meh. * Lychee Bubble Tea - very watered down and the bubbles were mushy.   The décor is modern and spacious. Plenty of seating and great for big groups."}
{"text":"Clean and quick service with food that's pretty good. I'd say all the standard fare and prices are normal for the quantity of Chinese food. Busy all the time!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen seems to be opening new locations regularly, and I can tell you why : quality and consistency.  The dishes they specialize in are always top notch, and their Chinese BBQ meats are better the most places that sell nothing but.  However my true love at Congee Queen is their Spicy Turnip Patties... Little dumpling type cubes made from daikon radish (not turnips) stir fried with dried shrimp, garlic, egg and fresh chillies.  Sounds weird, tastes awesome, and Congee Queen does them best.  Addictive hot or cold.  Hubby and I always get 2 orders so we each have our own.    Funny thing, I don't like it order Congee - just all the awesome side dishes they offer to have with Congee!"}
{"text":"A fairly large location but usually have a short wait because it's so busy.  They have a good take out section at the back for fast bbq style dishes.    The extensive menu keeps you coming back since there's always more to dishes to try but they also have dishes that are common across the congee places - seafood and meat congees, snacks and drinks.    If you frequent often enough, you might get lucky to get a VIP card that entitles you to 10% off each time.   Fast, quick and tasty food keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Salted fish fried Rice and them any congee you want, that is my go to when I go here. Accompanied with a couple of meat dishes you are set for lunch or dinner or even breakfast if your a snoozer.  The place is big and sometimes line ups goes crazy but generally the movement is pretty fast so its not like an hours wait, at least I haven't had to wait that long.  Try it out! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Congee Queen will always be THE GO-TO. No matter the location. Food quality and quantity are always consistent and the ambiance feels warm and familiar enough for your party of 15 family members to stand and wait 30 minutes by the entrance on a blizzarding Winter night just for a table.  Sat-in as soon as doors opened on a weekday morning for 2, hungry for something hot. Ordered congee and cheung fun (steamed rice noodle rolls).  Minced beef congee ($6.25) - yum. I actually prefer the seafood bowl since the salmon works beautifully with soupy rice but my table had a seafood allergy. Congee was runny but not too runny; thick but not too thick. You get it. Content with the amount of protein in my congee. However, requires soy sauce to flavor unlike other bowls I've had. 3.5/5  Shrimp and chive rice noodle ($5.95) - best I have ever had! Such a generous helping of shrimp. I've ordered this at Congee Queen before only to have found it to be average but I guess in this case early bird gets the worm! Scarfed it down in no time. 5/5  Lesson learned is that with Congee Queen, dine when its much less busy and there is no competing with other tables for your server's attention or perception your food is taking long to arrive from watching other tables digging in. Only had a good experience! Will be back."}
{"text":"Like most congee Queen locations, it is very nice, clean and PACKED! You may want to make reservations because the way that place was getting business was insane!! We had a big table but it was no problem for our friendly server, Oscar.  Oscar explained items to us, he made suggestions and he made us laugh- great example of a server.   We ordered hot and sour soup, turnip cakes, Fried squid, Beef with mushroom (Beware: huge pieces of ginger!!) and a couple variations of fried rice. I honestly cannot say I was disappointed about anything served to us. In the end, we still had left overs because we were so hungry and we definitely ordered way too much...but its great being full :)"}
{"text":"Very popular restaurant with great food. Service is okay, nothing special. Always busy which makes it hard to get your servers attention. They have the best hot and sour soup I've ever tasted in my life!  Give it a try at any of their 6 locations. I've try the Markham, Richmond hill and Thornhill location."}
{"text":"I have remembered this location of Congee Queen years ago. I used to work at Yonge and Eglinton. Whenever I had to plan a trip, I'd visit the CAA around the corner. This restaurant was always busy and I have been meaning to give it a try.   My wish came true last night. My boyfriend needed to drop off some used coats that he wanted to donate, which was along Lawrence Avenue East. He loves Chinese food, so I recommended that we have dinner here.   I love Yelp for researching eateries. Many tips said to book a reservation. I did a couple of nights ago. The woman on the other end of the phone was polite and competent. Sure enough, when we got there on a snowy evening, our reservation was right in front of her, on a yellow sticky note.   We were promptly seated. We actually got two tables mashed together, mainly because my guy had brought me some goodies from his recent travels and had just got off the plane to come see me.   He was hungry. We ordered the crab and corn soup. The regular size is rather large, but it was fine for two people. The soup came promptly and the hunger pangs disappeared immediately. There were generous chunks of crab and lots of corn kernels in the soup. I loved it so much.   We then got me our chicken black bean chicken and seafood ramen on hot sizzling plates. They were both good, but had a couple of weaknesses. Like the soup, the food portions are huge and the restaurant does not skimp on ingredients. There were a ton of chicken, scallops, shrimp, squid, green peppers, and more. The black bean chicken was tasty, but was too salty. The ramen was good, but it lacked flavour. We both figured to mix the two dishes up, which made both perfect.   We boxed our remaining food. It was a lovely date night. The ambiance is perfect for a snowy, miserable night.   I will return to sample more good food. I highly recommend the crab and corn soup. Unfortunately, we didn't have any soup left to take home. It is one of the best soups that I have in a awhile."}
{"text":"Food: solid Chinese food at a decent price. well sized portions and They don't skimp on the toppings either. Service: fast"}
{"text":"Their snowpeas with garlic was good.  Congee not so good, I tought Chi's Congee was better."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere similar to Springrolls, comfy chairs and good food for good prices but the service was bad. It was hard to get a server's attention because she doesn't look at you even when you stare at her to get her to take your order.   Neither of us knew what to order from their menu. There are so many kinds of congee, soup, chow mein and rice dishes as well as drinks and desserts. I wanted to try Fried Chili Turnip Patties and she got Corn and Bean Curd Congee and Fried Thick Noodles with Shrimp & Shredded Pork in Shanghai Style.  Fried Chili Turnip Patties was pretty good. It tasted like roasted chopped potatoes. I think I could have it for breakfast. The congee was okay. I wouldn't choose congees with bean curds in them though, because bean curds are soft; I want some crispiness or some flavour in my congee. Fried Thick Noodles was really bad. After taking one bite, we didn't want to eat it. I felt so bad wasting that huge dish but we didn't even have it packed to go. It was that bad. I'm sure people enjoy that dish but it just wasn't for us. There were very little pieces of shrimps and shredded pork; it was mostly the noodles and even the noodles were cut short and broke easily.  I would try a different congee if I come here again."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here last week. It was good, but not as good as Congee Wong. All the standard dishes are there and they certainly try to stuff the containers full of food. It was just one notch away from being really lip smacking delicious. They do deliver to the immediate area so that's nice. But I'm not sure if we would order from here again."}
{"text":"I often come here because it's close by.  The food is consistently well made and served quickly. We never have to wait too long, service is OK.  Price is reasonable, and portions are big. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Got takeout for a family event, and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"The seafood super bowl congee is excellent; hot and filled with great tasting seafood. The Chinese broccoli was not tender. The chicken meat has skin and fat attached; no chicken fat for me please.  I can only recommend this place for congee."}
{"text":"Food is ordinary, service is extremely poor. The waiter (Justin) threw plates and utensils hard on the table after we complaind about a bug found in a bowl of congee. Then when we asked for take out containers, another female server again threw stuff in front of us with unfriendly attitude. So rude!"}
{"text":"I never understood congee, isn't it just over boiled rice? I can make that at home!  Congee Queen is the place to go for asians. They love it. I can see why. the service is fast and friendly. The food is good and cheap. The location is clean and bright. Too many selections will keep you scratching your head for a while. drinks are a tad overpriced so stick with the water and tea."}
{"text":"Over priced low quality food. Usually we eat here with the family and finally got tired of this place. Service is slow and the food just lacks in quality. It's not worth eating here if you have 4 people or more."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is a local staple and favorite for Chinese food. Congee Queen offers multiple locations for convenience throughout the GTA. Although these locations carry the same name, I have heard and noticed slight differences in their dishes.  My dad and I ordered Empress Fried Rice, Cantonese Chow Mein, and Half BBQ Duck. The BBQ Duck and Cantonese Chow Mein tasted and were made exceptionally well. Although, I noticed a difference in their Empress Fried Rice. At the Congee Queen on Hwy 7, their Empress Fried is more savoury because they top it off with some sauce and contains more eel.   Service was very good. Our server was quick and polite. The speed in which we got our food was unusually fast, but I'm not complaining.  It wasn't as busy as I expected when we arrived around 5. It got busier once we left at 6.  Overall, food tasted great, speed and service was incredibl, and dishes are affordable."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is a great place for tasty Chinese Food. My friend and I ordered Empress Fried Rice, Cantonese Chow Mein, Congee (I think Sliced Beef Congee), and Spicy Salt & Pepper Squid.   It wasn't busy for a Wednesday afternoon, we were seated immediately, and were given complimentary green tea. All of our food came within a good amount of time. The Empress Fried Rice tasted really good, will most likely order it again. Cantonese Chow Mein tasted great; hard and crispy and soft, plus, all of the variety of meat, seafood, and vegetables on top. I don't regularly order congee but the Sliced Beef Congee tasted pretty good. Also, the Spicy Salt & Pepper Squid tasted great too, from what I heard, it was supposedly soggy but it wasn't for me, it was completely fine.   Prices for the food items we ordered were pretty much affordable for what was given. Also, portions were fair for each dish.   Will probably come back when craving Chinese Food."}
{"text":"New location but not as good as the other locations. I found the dishes here to be much more salty right across the board than there 2 locations in the East end."}
{"text":"If you are craving congee,  dim sum or pho,  this place has you covered.  Fresh ingredients, great service and a clean modern decor translate into a very pleasant and enjoyable dining experience.  When you come to a restaurant at 1130 am in the morning and the restaurant is packed, you know you have made the right choice.  Even the menus here deserve 4 stars. They are colourful and  have lots of accurate picture s of the dishes they are offering.  I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"There are a few choice words that really get me going.   Words like chocolate, buttery, Joe Manganiello and caramel sauce ellicit a Pavlovian response from me and as for the words Congee Queen? Well that abso-f&#king-lutely gets a similar reaction.     I had the pleasure of coming (teehee) here to help fellow Yelper Abbas N lose his congee virginity and this was no innocent dabbling in Chinese food.  First base/forplay consisted of the salt pepper squid (which is a kickass Chinese version of calamari) a perfect combo of airy crisp deep fried batter and chewy squid .  Next we were tantalized by the infamous turnip chili patties, which are like a sexed-up Sino-fied version of homefries and the final tease for Abbas was the chili pork (you see pork is to Abbas, what Magic Mike is to Sara, deeelightful!)    Finally, once the climactic congee arrived we got full frontal as we dipped our hard, delicious youtiao (fried bread) sticks into the hot savory congee filled with sensual seafood delights.  Eating soup and crackers by comparison is soooo \"PG\".     So, in closing,  if you like getting X-rated with a group of folks and some HOT Chinese food for under $50 bucks (plus enough for a big leftover doggie bag damn!) Congee Queen is the mama-san for you!"}
{"text":"We visited Congee Queen yesterday during what I can only describe as the perfect storm of non-ideal conditions. It was mid-day on a Sunday. It was the weekend of Chinese New Year. AND. It is Family Day weekend.  Yet, we persisted. Given that we were only looking for a 2 top, I figured the wait couldn't possibly be as long as the people around me were griping about. Thankfully, we only waited about 10 minutes, no big deal. I will say, for those who have to wait longer, the crowded front area is just a nightmare.   Once seated, we received a massive menu with far too many items to reasonably look at. I picked something from a picture and my bf got congee. We saw many delicious things fly past us that I will order in the future. Once we received our order, it was hot and fresh and delicious. However, would I say it is better than other places or worth the wait? NO.  What struck me more was the level of service. Granted, the place is absolutely rammed full of people and the huge crew of servers were doing what they could. Running from place to place, dodging people and quickly delivering food. But. I did encounter some rude service that I didn't like. The table next to us was asking questions about the menu. The server (angular bob haircut) just stared at them, wrote something down and walked away. The lady ordering and I exchange glances as if to say \"what the actual hell?\". The same table asked for the sauce caddy that should adorn the table. The first request was not granted, so they asked again. They ended up getting 2 caddies, again to their bewilderment. Also, as we were seated close to the kitchen pass window, we had the great pleasure of hearing a few of the male servers loudly swearing over something that bothered them. And given the din of the restaurant, they were yelling pretty loudly for us to hear them.  We may return to Congee Queen, if we're in the neighbourhood and it looks like the wait is minimal. But we're not rushing back."}
{"text":"This place is considered the second dining room for my family and I. We frequent this place so often since the food is consistently good and it is in a great location with plenty of parking spaces. Even visitors from out of town yearn to come back here!   Service: I have never seen such hard working servers before! They are all very quick on their feet, attentive and friendly.  Food: All items I have ordered here are full of flavour and portions are very generous. There is a large selection of items on the menu and would consider most items comfort food. I recommend the fried chili turnip patties, chicken and duck congee, satay chicken skewers and beef fried rice noodle. I would avoid the pho.  Atmosphere: The place is clean with decent modern decor for a chinese restaurant. Oftentimes though, I feel slightly high strung because of the hustle and bustle (hence the 4* instead of 5*).   If you plan on having dinner here for a party of 4-10, consider calling in advanced to make a reservation (or getting a table number ahead of time on your way there) to decrease your wait time."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the seafood was off the hook.  We had the shrimp congee and the shrimp with pepper salt and loved them"}
{"text":"Great congee and overall great food. I have been dining in this restaurant for over two years now and the food is very stable here, even if you walk in late at night the congee always tastes fresh and everything is made to order. They have recently added some new items which I loved like crab salad and fried garupa fillet. The menu is very extensive, they even serve pho and pad ties, which are actually very good. The servers there are quick and friendly and the prices are very reasonable. I only wish it would be closer to home."}
{"text":"I'm giving this location a balanced rating for both extremes of being a awful and amazing restaurant.    Amazing Component:  - The congee & dough sticks  - you can never go wrong here as they're reasonably priced at big portions   - Service was excellent - they even had a younger teenage boy who spoke fluent English, in case somebody who wasn't Chinese decided to wander in and order without difficulty  Horrible: - The use of MSG is overwhelming. - They overuse this enhancement in every single dish (maybe not the congee or the dough sticks) but it knocks out your appetite a little."}
{"text":"I love the congee here and the oil dough stick.  The prices are crazy good for a BIG BOWL of congee for an approximate $6.  However, that's it. I don't like anything else here as it seems to be filled with MSG and makes me very nauseous."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out the new Mississauga location! So happy there is another good Chinese spot in the area. My friends and I went around 9 pm on a Monday night, it was busy but we managed to grab a table for 4 right when we got there.   The menu has a huge selection, there were so many things I wanted to try from the menu, but my group opted for:   - Roasted pork: the outer layer is SOO crispy which I LOVE and the meat is super tender... the meat falls off the bone really easily compared to other places where I have to really bite into it! It is so perfect with the sauce ... it wasn't a SUPER BIG portion but it was enough to share among 4 people. I can't wait to go back and get it again!   - spicy turnip patties: I was so excited for this! It didn't disappoint at all, I just wish that it was actually spicy LOL but nothing a simple hot sauce won't fix :) it was made really fresh because I waited half hour and it was still super hot ... be warned, it is so addicting you won't be able to stop eating it   - spiced squid: if you enjoy saltier and fried foods, then this is the dish for you! It was hella salty, but not to the point where it was a bad thing. Just make sure you have water with you or your mouth will be really dry LOLL   - crispy Cantonese chow mein: I ordered this based on the picture, but it was way more saucy when I got it. It wasn't crispy at all... A little disappointed because it looked so crispy in the menu, but nonetheless it was really good. Perfect amount of noodles to go with the meat and veggies.   - crab meat congee: I don't usually order congee at restaurants but this was really flavourful. Id enjoy it a lot more if there were more crab meat in it though. I don't order congee often because I find most places' congee have no taste, no matter what flavour and topping I order. Of course, if a restaurant had congee in their name I definitely have to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did!  Service wasn't above and beyond but the servers got the job done quickly for us. We had multiple servers throughout the night who were easy to track down and got everything we requested right away!   I so recommend Congee Queen!! I'll definitely be back soon to try out other things, and get the turnip patties again ahaha."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. My uncle likes to take my brother and I here for brunch. Usually we are the first ones there before the huge crowd hits after noon and they are pretty quick to bring us the food when we get there early.   We normally get the seafood congee which is always amazing. I was pretty sure instead of the salmon, they added huge pieces of scallops. I guess it's different every time or whatever they had available. It's still delicious but with the scallops, it's even better. Congee is always good with the fried dough too.   We always get the snow peas with the mushrooms. So plain but so good. I think that cost the most than anything else at our table but it was hella worth it.   We also got the fried chili turnip patties, SOOOO GOOOD and this time it wasn't too salty which my uncle liked. There was bits and pieces of shrimp and chicken and the turnips were still crunchy and soft inside. Talking about it now makes me crave it at the moment.   Another dish that we got was the beef fried rice, without the beef.. My brother made it very clear he wanted beef friend rice with vegetables but there was no beef which was pretty funny to me. I'm not a huge fan of the fried rice because I can really get it anywhere.   They also missed our szechewan chicken which we were waiting for for a long time. We were already full but it would have been nice to try it.   Overall, I like coming to this location when they are not super busy. When they are busy, they tend to make us wait for our additional take out orders. This time we didn't order take out for my parents because last time they made us wait 45 mins for our crab claws."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since it opened. It is comparable to the other locations, finally one close by so we don't have to go so far. Wait isn't too long for a table for 2 but takes longer if your a larger group. The food tastes fresh and good portion size. I love their fried turnip patties! I have to get it everytime. The service is very average like most Chinese restaurants, you have to flag someone down to get something."}
{"text":"Got here  around little before 11pm.  We ordered 4 dishes for two people. Lobster, chowmein, salted squid and congee.  First in our congee, there was alot of sliver scrubs in the congee. I asked them to remake it for us. And new congee has same problem. Silver scrub. It would be better if it was real silver.   Second when we were almost in the beginning of our meal, they asked us to leave because they had to close. If they had to kick us out, they should have told us that they are closing soon or something. Wrong service. Actually horrible.   Third, their place are clean but their service and their actual kitchen is bad bad very bad. How could they have scrub in the food? Not just a one. It was a lot that i can see and could not eat at all. Because it was so right there in my face.   Do not go even the outside looks clean. The actual food is so shitty."}
{"text":"I used to go here often but I realized their food wasn't that good... The food can be plain & the service is eh.   I prefer congee star which is a few blocks south of Don Mills and Lawrence"}
{"text":"We came to order Deep Fried Dough Fritter to go. Got it very quickly.  Taste was not bad, crunchy and crispy. However the dough was chewy. Other congee places I go to was less dough, more on the crispy side. Meh."}
{"text":"MY TORONTO STAPLE FOR CHINESE FOOD!    Congee queen offers a great chinese food selection at great prices and quick service.  They also do large party tray orders which are always helpful for those potluck parties or big filipino parties as in my family!  I love their quick take out and especially the BBQ counter.  Always piping hot and fresh to order.  Amazing!  A few staples that I always order:  Cantonese Chow Mein, Yeung Chow Fried Rice and any of their soups.  Also their steamed rice noodles - ALL!  Be prepared that on weekends they are VERY busy!  Be prepared to wait ... but it is worth the wait .. trust me!  You won't be disappointed.  Service is ok - typical Asian service but they are quick and can turnover their tables quickly.  Will definitely be back at every Toronto visit!"}
{"text":"Food was good. But I've been here twice and on both times they messed up our orders. Gave us the wrong order and gave our order to the table beside us. They say 3 times a charm so let's see the next time I visit."}
{"text":"The selection of congee offered at Congee Queen is simply amazing.  I noticed the previous reviews either simply mentioned the availability of congee, or the very typical congee like pork and preserved egg congee.  But what you want to try here is the congee varieties that are not typical.  We went to Congee Queen on the last night of my visit to Toronto.  But we weren't too hungry so we decided to split two bowls of congee and the House Seafood & Mixed Vegetable Fried Taiwanese Vermicelli between us.  For the two congees, we ordered the Fresh Geoduck Clam Congee and the Assorted Fungus & Six-Grains Congee.  I've never had geoduck in congee before so I definitely wanted to try it.  My aunt was eating with me and she had mentioned earlier how she tried and failed to make congee from brown rice, so when we saw that Congee Queen makes a congee out of six different grains, we knew we wanted to try that, too.  The grains in the Assorted Fungus & Six-Grains Congee consist of: brown rice, hulless barley, French red rice, rye berries, purple barley, and Japanese rice.  I'm pretty sure I have never eaten half of those grains before.    Both of these congees were delicious and the texture and consistency were just right.  You could really taste the different grains in the Six-Grain Congee, and I especially liked the geoduck in the Geoduck Congee.   While we were eating, I noticed that they also offer a Pumpkin Hot Pot Congee with Rock Crab Meat & Vegetarian Shark Fin.  Had I seen that on the menu earlier, I would have ordered it, too.  Next time!"}
{"text":"This is good canto Chinese food after a good day of exercise... After our NTSC ski day, this is the place we head to to forge on Chinese food.... Prices are cheap and the quality of bbq pork is excellent.,   Meat is lean (not fatty) , warm and amazing.., the fried tofu/vegetable dish is great too...  Free parking at centre point mall but it gets very busy on a Saturday night.. The sweet and sour pork was crispy combined with the sweet/sour sauce..,   Overall it's an amazing place for good canto foof"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese resto for soup noodles. The quality and quantity are superb and really satisfies a craving. The noodles also come with a red bean ice cream float. Love love love. The decor is also very nice making it a good seating area."}
{"text":"Came in Friday night at around 9:00pm and it was quite busy, almost every table was taken and it was very loud. We were greeted promptly and seated at a booth. The booths were quite small as well as tables (could only fit max maybe 5 dishes) but comfy.   Food was good but very oily. I guess that's kind of expected at most Chinese restaurants. Right now they're offering their seasonal lobster for $24.99 (I think it was 1.5lbs). Prices went up from the last time I was here. I would recommend coming with multiple people so you guys can share the dishes (portions are quite large) and split the hefty bill (e.g one vegetable dish could be $15.99).   The service is what you would expect at any Chinese place-so many staff around but hard to get the attention of any. Food came out speedy though which was excellent for us hungry people."}
{"text":"Was invited to dinner with a few friends. I had seen this location before, but never had stopped in. All in all, was a very nice meal, good service and very reasonable prices. I have been back twice since and each time, the food was consistently good and the service was quick, fast and friendly. Overall, I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday with about 12 of my friends and I did not regret it at all. Although it was quite far from North York, it was on the way and We decided to eat here instead.  We sat at 2 tables and basically ordered all the food together and then shared by ourselves. We had quite a lot of dishes. We had the Bok Choy, chicken, pork (I'm not sure what kind), egg and shrimp fried rice, rice noodles with beef and Cantonese chow mein.   My favourite was the rice noodles since it was fairly filling and tasted the best. Both the chicken and pork were a little too sweet for my liking. The Bok Choy was cooked very nicely and the rice was good as well. The chow mein tasted good but was a little too hard for me to eat.   We also had the fried tempura like squid. It was okay but lacked a little flavour  In general, none of the dishes were outstanding but all of them were considerably good. For a group of 12 we were full by the end of the meal and the food came out quick."}
{"text":"I wish I had Congee Queen by me. I would be there every week. There's a nice variety of items on the menu ranging from dim sum to noodles to of course, congee.  This place is obviously known for their congee, but they should also be recognized for their amazing roast pork. It's made fresh, and you can see it hanging in the warmer by the register. The skin was perfectly roasted with that bubbly, crackly skin (not rubbery!) and the meat was juicy, tender, and cut correctly. You'd be amazed at how many places are very lazy about their butchering, and little pieces of bone just ruin it for  you.  Service was good, and our waitress made sure we ordered enough for our table. This place will always be on my list when I'm back in town, and it should be on your's!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with their recent price hike, which I think being quite steep, around 25%?? With this raise of price, I just hope they could keep the food quality, portion of take out the same as dine-in, cleanliness of the place.... or I will go less."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese food. Service wasn't amazing, but it was busy. Probably should have had a better plan of what to get before I went. There was a lot of food to choose from. I was overwhelmed. Go with a plan, come out happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Love this location! Reservations for 4 and 2 babies.   Ordered tons of food.   Please keep in mind these dishes are meant to be shared... if you order 2 dishes for yourself good luck!!   Food came out fast and fresh and delicious! The bubble tea we ordered were the actually bubble tea, we didn't specify the slushie version which I would of enjoyed more. The washrooms are clean and the prices are really decent!   Definitely a go-to spot when it comes to congee and dim sum can't wait to go back soon"}
{"text":"Service excellence!! Went to a few congee queens and this one definitely had me talking about the service. Walked in waiting for a table for two and we were seated immediately.     Ordered squid tentacles, fried turnips, general Tao chicken, and a small bowl of congee and lemme tell you I was DONE. Full to the max, and was still able to bring a ton of food home. The food was amazing! I loved it, couldn't find anything wrong with this location.   The best part is that it came up to $44! That's great for the amount of food, and quality of it.   If your a fan of squid tentacles... this was definitely the best ones I've ever had, they actually melted in my mouth, wasn't over cooked or chewy which honestly is why I'm giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"i've been here on multiple occasions but my most recent visit was not a great experience.  we made a reservation for 13, and they were cool with that, but when we got there, they didn't have a table to seat that many people. so they expected us to be separated. one round table for the majority of the people and a booth table which seats 4.  with asian food, the idea is to order multiple dishes and share the different foods, how the hell do you do that when the tables are split? the other thing we wanted to do, was to pull the big round table over to the booth so that even though it is a bit awkward, we can all kinda sit together, talk together, and share food with each other. they didn't want us to do that because it blocks their path to other tables. mind you, we were sitting at a corner, and if we pulled the table over, they would have a different path (an more convenient one at that) to service the other tables. maybe these people are programmed robots, because we pulled the table over on our own anyways making sure not to block any fire exits and such and these servers really looked confused when their normal route was no longer available.  we ordered a lot of food for 13 people and the food was at least good so the cooks did a good job at least. good job, cooks."}
{"text":"Very busy location. Food and service are up to congee queen standards. Turnip cubes are the best."}
{"text":"pretty standard congee queen. pretty much the same as all the other congee places. nothing that really stands out about it, but good enough that you'll come back if u are craving this style of food."}
{"text":"Top marks all around.  Six adults for dinner on Saturday.  Without exception, all the dishes were very good.  Cantonese chow mein, beef brisket lo mein, tofu and veggies, Yang Chou fried rice, General Tso's chicken, hot & sour soup, beef ho fun.  Service was also very good, attentive and unobtrusive.  The free parking is a bonus.  Go early because the place is packed."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ pork Rice noodle roll and the house Pad Thai, very good.   Really good and authentic place for a variety of Asian food.   It's a big place so if you have a lot of people coming don't worry!  Portion sizes are huge!! Watch out!  1 order of the Pad Thai can easily feed 2 people if not 3 (tiny, small appetite)!    Great open concept and fast service.   If heard about this place from other people but finally had the opportunity to visit for myself.  And I have to say it should be on your to do list!"}
{"text":"I order a \"black bean beef rice noddle\", it was good, price is reasonable, place is clean, service is friendly.  Worth a repeat"}
{"text":"This place is super busy but their service is fast and food was good.  I enjoy hanging out at this location rather than the one at Yonge/Steeles."}
{"text":"It's essentially a glorified version of congee Wong that's prettier and more expensive without the food being any better (or sometimes worse). My bf goes there for the soft-shell crab fried rice otherwise I'd rather go to congee Wong. Their shrimp wonton noodle, btw, is weird tasting and not fresh; in fact, it gave me hives all over my face. I guess it's nice though to have at least one nice place in the area that serves authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"This review goes out to my two #1 fans who have asked me if I was going to review Congee Queen. Considering reviewing congee queen is like reviewing Asian Mcdonalds, I immediately said no. However, after coming home after our big meal and thinking about this, I realized that I need to be a better person and ensure that those who stalk me feel rewarded with an easter egg, I shall now write this one out for JT and RS.   Did I enjoy eating at the first and original Congee queen? Of course I did. The food was good, but most importantly CQ allowed us to import 15.5 asians into the restaurant and combine two large round tables so we can all steal food for each other  and make jokes across the table at the top of our lungs. At the end of the meal, we even got some free dessert (red bean sago with grass jelly and a touch of milk).   I should mention though that I prefer the xo sauce turnip cakes here moreso than congee king. It's much less oily and much more crispy and flavourful. Their stir fried baby bok choy with garlic and their snow pea leaves are also much better. It's slightly more expensive than CK, but it might just be worth it.  It's hard not to enjoy a meal when the restaurant makes room for a large lovable group ;)"}
{"text":"Party of 4 around 8:30 on a Thursday night. Having been to Congee Queen many, many times with the big Chinese family I was expecting the same experience of stuffing all this amazing-full-of-depth-flavour-and-texture food into my face. Quite honestly, I felt ashamed that I had brought my friend here for his first congee resto experience.  We ordered a wide variety of items so we could try a little bit of everything, yes, we planned on taking much of it home. The service was as expected, you have to flag down a server if you need anything from placing your order to asking for the bill. The staff were in good spirits, we were served with smiles and they were smiling and chatting nicely amongst themselves. I made a special request for a single century egg and they were happy to inquire with the kitchen about it. (For those who interested, if you order a side century egg, they give you a small bowl of chopped egg that was destined for congee, not for presentation on it's own.)  The food came out SLOW (relative to a usual visit at Congee Queen). It took a span of 40 minutes for all of our dishes to be served from the moment we got our first dish to the moment we got our final dish. Definitely unhappy about that. This aspect of our evening stood out since we had planned on going to a movie after dinner expecting that service would be quick.  K15 - Beef with Mushroom on Sizzling Hot Plate - 5/5 - Dish was flavourful and definitely sizzling hot as the title describes. Real, visible, ingredients. Tender beef, well cooked mushrooms, onions, & ginger. :D  K53 - Fried Chili Turnip Patties - 3/5 - Kinda meh, unevenly cooked, some pieces were well done, some barely fried, not much chili, was under seasoned overall and not hot enough.  K42 - Spice & Pepper Salt Squid - 2/5 - Squid pieces were unusually large and heavily battered, soggy not crispy. Had an immediate fishy smell upon arriving at the table. Barely any chili and almost no salt. It was the most disappointing dish of the night. We were looking forward to it so much. :(  A4 - Assorted Fungus and Six-Grains Congee - 4/5 - Good amount of mushroom, pretty sad amount of the six grains to be titled as such. I'd say of the whole bowl of congee consisted of maybe 3% of the \"six grains\"  G17 - BBQ Duck Thick Vermicelli in Soup - 2/5 - Duck pieces were quite bony, skin wasn't crispy but chewy and soggy. Duck was served on a side plate and not on top of the noodles for some reason. Noodles were over cooked, soft and mushy, no satisfactory and signature al dente Lai Fun texture to be found. Another :(  H11 - Diced Chicken with Salted Fish Fried Rice - 5/5 - Perfectly cooked fried rice, nice separation of every single grain of rice, good size dice on all the ingredients. Good ratio of salted fish to rice. Served nice and hot. :D  Overall, more misses than hits this time around Congee Queen. But not enough to turn us off your giant menu. We'll always be back for our congee restaurant fix and avoid the dishes that disappointed during this visit. I am sorry that my review was initiated by a poor experience and not a great one..."}
{"text":"You know, the independent chains of Congee places here in Toronto is not consistent at all.  This particular location is \"immaculate\" considering it's a Congee House, you know what I mean.  That said, this makes a great cheap date place for those under budget youngsters or families out there.  Food wise, it's good, not great.  Cleanliness, excellent overall, including a very clean bathroom.  Service was quick.  My favorite item here is the stir fry cubes of daikon cake, well executed.  Congee wise, I still prefer Congee King on Kennedy south of Hwy 7, maybe I am just old school or something."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because it's Tuesday, but the Congee I had along w/ the BBQ plate (3 kinds) were only ok.  My Char Sui on the BBQ plate was cut improperly, leaving the meat tough and fatty.  As anyone who has cooked seriously, you know beef and pork are cut differently according to their \"grain flow\".  They really messed my up big time, considering it's very basic knowledge.  In addition, I felt a scratchy throat feeling after my meal, can also be due to uncleanliness around the BBQ area, who knows.  Congee was ok, nothing great.  Fish inside the congee was a little fishy, not a lot but the fish texture is not very smooth/tender like the way I normally prefer.  All in all, one can expect a quick meal out of this place but don't expect too much."}
{"text":"Love this place, here 2X a month.. The only downfall is there sautéed vegetables are super oily and lack that garlic flavour.  I recommended you ask for non MSG, and I usually feel tired and bloated after eating at congee queen,so now i say no MSG!  Food will not be as salty"}
{"text":"Our go-to chinese food for a hearty meal. Food is consistently good.   Nice decor, comfortable seating."}
{"text":"This location being in a non Asian mall allows for plentiful parking, and the service inside is very consistent and fool quality top notch.  Lara the manager is always ensuring the customers are happy with their food and following up with all requests.  I frequent them for the lunch specials along with the congee selections when friends visit looking for a quick light meal."}
{"text":"Having been to their other locations, thus one has a pretty big foot print and plenty of seating... if you can manage to get seated.  Going in at peak of Friday night dinner, I was asking for trouble.  Fortunately I was seated but saw the line up grow outside, surprisingly there were also many empty tables to be found... the staff were hard to flag down and walk in 3s chit chatting away.  When our order finally went in, we got 2 wrong dishes.  The staff did not seam to care about this even upon telling them twice of it.  The food was super salty.  More so than the other ones as we usually order the same stuff.  I would go down the street to congee time with better service than come back. Meh"}
{"text":"Came here with my family. We have been accustomed to the Congee Queen in Promenade Mall for years and so we came here for the first time just to try it out. We ordered the same things that we ordered at that restaurant and we were not disappointed. We had around four dishes and we were all full after that, we have leftovers. My favorite dish was the turnip patties because they were hot and fresh. Turnip patties were really good, hot & fresh. Service was okay, nothing special though. Would definitely come back here due to the atmosphere and how fast the food came out."}
{"text":"I like it more than congee wong. Good for big groups and service is also fast. Reasonable prices and food is delicious!"}
{"text":"A new Chinese restaurant that recently opened. The menu is quite similar to other locations with the exception of some new dishes. The quality is also consistent with other locations as well. While the decoration looks nice but the structure seems to be like an open space with limited number of booth seats. It is a big restaurant with a lot of open seatings. While the service is decent, foods are delicious with generous portion at a reasonable price.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Lobster chow mein is a must try here. Generous portion enough for two people. Duck BBQ is also freshly made and good. Servers are nice enough.  I enjoy this place. All foods here are good. Big menu so there is always things to try out.  Totally recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent quick service and large well made Cantonese dishes. They also make slushie drinks and have a great variety of dishes beyond just the congee (rice based soup)."}
{"text":"Beware of MSG, I had a bitter melon with beef yesterday, get up middle of the night and my lips and gum are swollen, also diarrhea all day. The rest of the food are ok, big portion and low price, waited 30 minutes at 6pm on Sunday for party of 5."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years! Great family restaurant with traditional canto dishes to share. Favourites are the eel fried rice, fish maw soup, double boil chicken and clams seasoned with black bean sauce. Good value for your dollar. Make sure to make reservations because it gets PACKED!"}
{"text":"I ordered congee with seafood. The paper place mat has a story to tell. So essentially it is overlooked rice. I like the idea of not wasting anything. The taste is different. Although what I'm about to say is about two different cuisines: I went from exploring pho to congee. I thought congee was bland. Pho was more flavourful which sounds like a silly point but to a new foodie it is not. I added hot sauce and it didn't improve the taste that much. I guess I draw the line here. I think there are some foods that you need to acquire the taste for over a long time."}
{"text":"Food way really good... Portion was alot.. Nice service. Good eats & reasonable priced."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family. Their lunch specials came with your choice of red bean drink and  other iced options that are normally extra which was a good deal.   I had the fried udon with beef and I thought that was ok, udon was cooked perfectly but i felt the dish was lacking in beef . My mother had the pineapple chicken which was a disappointment and not good at all. I found the food filling and service was fast. Overall, nothing special and I've had better food at a food court."}
{"text":"Service - not so great Food - Amazing When coming too congee Queen, the food is always so good! Don't expect great service though.... If you come here without reservation, there will always be a spot for you (maybe expect holidays). My favourite dishes areeeee 1. Congee - they are named CONGEE QUEEN for a reason :) they have many from the menu that you can order from. If your having trouble deciding on which one to order, ask the server there!  2. Fried sea cod - okai, I'm a huge fan of fish, so love this dish is no surprise :p. The price is around $20, but the portion for this dish is quite small. They place broccoli around the cod.  The reason I love congee queen so much is because the taste of there food is always so flavourful and very filling. This is a restaurant I highly recommend if you love Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Went to this location on family day and it was not as bad as I was expecting regarding the holiday. We were seated right away, service was a bit difficult to get but all in all it was a good experience. Not much to say since it was nothing extraordinary from other Chinese cuisine (although the beef on the sizzling hot plate was really good). My family and I ordered a lot of stuff and all tasted great! Lots to choose from"}
{"text":"Looking at the various locations they have of this restaurant we lucked out because we were closest to the restaurant with the highest rating.   We came here for breakfast and got a huge vat of congee. I don't mean to make it sound unappealing but then again congee is porridge that is shared across the family. The seafood one we ordered was fishy. The kids weren't huge fans of it. Other dishes that were a hit was the fried dough. I know.. it's just bread made in a deep fryer.. nothing too complicated but it was the perfect crunchiness to it and I loved it! I use it to dip into the congee and eat it like a makeshift spoon.   Their rice crepes are ginormous. Note: pictures in the menu do not always match the food served. The rice crepe on the menu was teeny tiny compared to what we got. That's good right?   Service surprisingly was very NY style (or maybe HK style). The server was terse, busy as heck and in a bit of a rush as if he was also manning the porridge in the kitchen and didn't want to overbook or overboil it. I doubt he has kitchen responsibilities but he was clearly busy running around and manning a lot of tables at once.   It's fine. We got our food and things were Yummy! We will be back."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now.   Aside from the very loud crowd that dines here I find that the food is great. Huge portions and the service is very fast.   Décor, traditional Chinese/Canadian type style.  We ordered the fish congee, Salt and pepper squid, bbq pork, deep fried tofu dish, lobster and some steamed rice. Five of us were stuffed after this meal. The portions are huge and the prices are fantastic. Where else could you eat all this food for about $80.00 for five people drinks and taxes included?"}
{"text":"One of the best locations out of the chain and consistent with their food. Love the fried turnip cakes and empress fried rice (with eel)!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 20 a little after 8pm last night and we had two large tables. Service was prompt and helpful and they were able to recommend lots of dishes for our large party. Since we were there later, there weren't too many people or long lines.   Since we had a large group, we were able to order some of everything and everyone was able to find something they liked. Food overall was decent, a little salty for me but everyone else at my table seemed to really like it. The quantities were huge, we definitely ordered too much food but after two hours we managed to get through most of it.   I would say most of my friends liked it including those who had never been to a Chinese restaurant. It was a fun, relaxed atmosphere and it was different for our large group so everyone had a good time."}
{"text":"Yeah! We don't have to drive to hwy 7 for Congee Queen anymore! We went there for lunch and dinner today (Monday) and it was packed both times. There's no lunch specials, but they do have happy hour from 3-5 (meals come with a drink like bubble tea or red bean with ice cream), but the food is so good and the portions are on the large side.   Lunch - We were a group of 4 and ordered a small chicken and albalone congee (I highly recommend this, there were 5 big pieces of albalone), fried sticky rice (this is my favourite), seafood chow mein (lots of seafood, but too much sauce for my liking, I like my noodles more crunchy and dry) and an order of BBQ pork. The BBQ port is probably the best that I've had in Mississauga!  Dinner - Group of 5 adults and we ordered their signature egg white and canopy rice fried surrounded by sauce and see through noodles (like the imitation shark fin), the chicken/shrimp/mango dish (chicken and shrimp were lightly battered and came in a sweet sauce), beef stew, roasted pork (the skin was hot and super crunchy) and beef with mushrooms.   The service is excellent, waiters were attentive and were rushing/running to deliver food to the tables. The only negative thing I have to say is that their dishware could use more thorough cleaning - sometimes there were small pieces of stuff still stuck on and the black seems to be coming off their chopsticks (maybe cuz of the bleach?). In any case, we liked it so much at lunch, that we returned for dinner a few hours later"}
{"text":"The decor here is very nice and the portions are large for the price. I think it's one of the best Chinese restaurants in the agincourt area.   It does get quite busy and I'm not particularly fond of the crowded bench-like seating area. It feels like I'm eating in a cafeteria.   However, I've really enjoyed the food and desserts that I ordered. The milk bubble tea isn't bad. The staff do have a rushed feeling but they do take the time to speak to you, if needed."}
{"text":"Great food that upholds the standard across the other Congee Queen locations.   The service here was good and our server was kind enough to give us recommendations to get the most bang for our buck. Moral of the story is that the serving sizes are huge and that I really need to work on overestimating how much I can eat!  If you're new to the chain, I'd suggest you try their signature House Seafood & Mixed Veggie Fried Vermicelli (it goes amazing with their chili oil which is fragrant but not overly spicy) and their BBQ meats."}
{"text":"I frequent this location at least 1-2 times a month.  The food is always good, hot and fresh and the price is decent.  Wait staff are not pushy, and not trying to turn your table as soon as you finish eating.  The dining room is a good size and the lunch and afternoon tea specials are very good.  The bbq is a bit more expensive compared to other Chinese bbq places but it is clean and flavourful.  This is the place to go to when our party can't decide what to have.  Congee queen has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Having some good fried squid and turnips.  The Fried Chili Turnip patties is one of the things to get when you order.  Congee Queen is one of two locations that sell Turnips.   Spice & Pepper Salt Squid was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I visited Congee Queen on Christmas for dinner, which was unplanned since the restaurant we did originally plan to eat at decided to close early for Christmas.  Surprisingly we entered to a completely filled up restaurant, along with a 20 minute waiting line. We had no choice but to wait, which gave us a chance to browse their menu. Good thing they had quite a few vegetarian dishes, for my vegetarian mom and brother.  It was freezing cold outside so the sound of hot congee seemed really appetizing.  We finally got a table but the service was seriously lacking, which I wasn't too mad about as it was so busy. We had to literally walk up to the server and ask him for the tea that they seemed to give everyone else except us.  Since we were starving, we started off with a tofu and vegetable stir fry just to share as an appetizer. Then for mains I changed my mind and went for the 1/2 soy sauce chicken with rice, my dad got the small chicken congee, mum got the pad thai (odd choice, but whatever) and brother got the large (!!!) mushroom congee.  The food was served pretty quickly, starting off with the tofu stir fry which when arrived left us speechless based on the serving size! It was gigantic!! It was delicious though. Then came my 1/2 chicken. This was when we realized that all the dishes are meant to be shared because the 1/2 chicken wasn't a Nando's sized 1/2 chicken which I can demolish, but rather seemed twice the size. My dad's congee was a perfect size for one but my brother realized that he made a huge mistake when his congee arrived, since the large can definitely feed 3 people. Same for the pad thai.  For the taste, my chicken and pad thai were alright...a bit bland, so we had to add a fair amount of soy sauce on top.  The congee, however, was completely bland. It had to be dowsed in hot sauce and soy sauce for it to have any flavour.   Based on the portion size and price, it was definitely worth it. But I think if you are into foods with a lot of flavour and some heat, then Cantonese style Chinese food may not be your thing. Overall, this was a great restaurant. The only reason for my 3 stars was due to personal taste preferences."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Except, the service ruined the whole meal. Came here after a major milestone event, we made reservations as we knew that it would have been busy on a Sunday lunch. Yet, despite coming ON-TIME for our reservations, we had to wait 40 minutes until we finally got our table. The attending waitress kept ignoring us, when we asked him about our table. He was rude.  Yet, time after time he would say \"yep, we are setting that table for you now\", but then it turns out that table was then given to some other customer... this happened 3x throughout our entire 40 minute wait.. DESPITE MAKING RESERVATIONS A FEW DAYS BEFORE.   BEWARE - don't come in during rush hour times. Congee Queen, you got to work on your customer service."}
{"text":"Have been going to their other locations in Toronto for a long time and was excited to hear that they were finally opening one in Mississauga. The restaurant is decorated nicely with a modern look. I came on opening day and their customer service was great as there wasn't too many tables.  We ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein and it came quickly. Portion size was great in terms of meat and noodles. I love how they're always making the noodles at the right level of crispness served with the right amount of sauce. Shrimps were huge and the squid was bouncy!  Can't wait to come here and try their other new menu items like the HK style lobster."}
{"text":"I usually go to Congee Queen if I want some comforting food... and I know the quality and quantity never disappointed...especially if I want some decent Chinese food after hours...  Services always Meh..... Staffs all looked tired and overworked... and wish they are somewhere else.  Ask for something... an extra bowl? some hot sauce? If you lucky they will arrive eventually.... if not ask again....  They accepts Visa and Mastercard...."}
{"text":"I have never been to this Congee Queen's location till now.  Menu is identical to the other Congee Queen's location up in Markham which I frequent.  The deco though is a little outdated and in need for some renovation.  We ordered a Congee and a Noodle to share which were both really good and the portion was generous.  Good price and opens till 12:00 am. A great place for a late night snack!"}
{"text":"Usually Congee Queen has consistent quality of food in most of their restaurants but this location had been consistently disappointed me.  Today might be the last draw as the congee we ordered has no seasoning in it and the fish still has small pieces of bones."}
{"text":"2.5 star  Another Congee Queen Location just opened in Scarborough.  Decoration definitely one of the nicest out of the other Congee Queens I have been to. However, this new location definitely suffering from growing pains with the inexperienced staffs and the overworked kitchen.  Both items we ordered definitely not as good as Markham location that I frequent. My Home Style Vermicelli ($7.99) has quite a bit of burnt and dried noodle and Fried Bean Curd with Veggie ($9.50) was a little overcooked and soggy.  The complimentary dessert though is good enough to save my meal.....  Staffs are just a little confused and overworked. As for now, I definitely would not go out of my way to this Congee Queen's location. Hopefully that would have changed after a month or 2.   Visa, MC and Debit payments are all welcome!"}
{"text":"Congee Queen has a limited lunch special menu for Monday - Friday... So limited that there are only 4 items on it...starting from $6.25 which includes a mushroom soup and 1 veggie spring roll..  I would say don't bother to order off this limited menu... value is not there... taste not there... feels like they have them precooked and left them under the heated lamp...  LB3 Fried Thick Noodle in Shanghai Style ($7.25) -Soup is so salty.. and salty is the only taste..sliced button mushroom, a few peas and egg... that have non flavour but saltiness - Shanghai noodle... so oily.. so salty... so cold.. so bad tasting! - the size is smallish... and it is better off you order from the main menu  6 Whole Grain and Mushroom Congee ($6.99) - Luckily this congee saved my lunch... even it is meatless but has a lot of flavour... - all these whole grains inside the congee gives it a nice and crunchy feel - I love mushrooms so I really enjoyed the assorted fungus!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and was seated immediately as it wasn't so busy. Ordered a couple dishes and it turns out that everything was way too salty (except for the fried turnips which were delicious). The fried squid was so salty we couldn't finish it. Asked for hot sauce twice before getting a small dish for 4 people. Once that was used up, asked for 2 more and was given just 1. So service was pretty bad."}
{"text":"Wow. love the seafood congee and beef n sausage rice in clay pot. Fried beef w mushroom is a classic dish and the roasted duck is my favorite."}
{"text":"bbq duck never beats!! All my taste buds are addicted to this duck and I almost finished all the BBQ duck. Dried oyster with vegs congee is also very yummy"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant to you~ The congee is very soft and easy to eat. Bbq pork, or  bbq duck is a must try here"}
{"text":"Been to this place probably 10 times now. It's convenient, and good. The congee is superb, as is the fried noodles. Oh yeah, no chicken balls on the menu."}
{"text":"I usually have a pretty good experience here, and I have come a good number of times with my family. It is PACKED pretty much every single time we come here for lunch on a Sunday, but you can usually get a table pretty quick if you are willing to share with other groups.   On our most recent visit, we ordered the seafood super bowl congee and the house seafood & mixed vegetable fried Taiwanese vermicelli. I thought the congee was pretty good, there was a lot of seafood in it and it was decently flavourful/not bland. It also came in a huge bowl, so I thought it was worth it for $10.95. I wasn't quite as impressed with the vermicelli though. This dish was actually kind of bland and uninteresting, and I didn't think it was worth the price of $11.95.  Service is usually pretty prompt, they have a lot of staff working (as they should, since it is so busy), so the food comes pretty quickly, and it's not too hard to flag someone down if you need anything."}
{"text":"What Karen N. said. This place has been and will always be my go-to restaurant to fill that empty void of craved chinese food when returning from a week long business trip full of western food.  Service is great. Food is great. Atmosphere is fine.  You can't go wrong eating here...often."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, the decor+food. Only problem I had was the fact that the waitress got our food wrong and continuously blamed it on us. Other than that I would go here again!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Markham. The staff are fast and efficient, and are more focused on getting the job done rather than providing a super warm and friendly atmosphere (especially true during the weekends). Food is very good and satisfying. I'd recommend getting the Crispy Tiger Shrimp and Mango Salad Tossed with Custard Sauce. It's one of my favourite dishes. Also has very good General Tao Chicken. The food comes out pretty fast despite the busyness, and the staff are all very respectful. Only thing is that if you go on the weekends, you'll be met with a waiting time of up to a half hour. You'll be given a number, which they will call out when it is your turn to be seated, so be sure to listen for it. Otherwise, it's a place I'd recommend going to for good Chinese food."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Vancouver, I love me some good Chinese food. Imagine my devastation when I moved to Toronto and discovered that my expectations needed to be adjusted way down! It's almost like you're forced to pick 2 out of 3 attributes: cheap, delicious, or clean. It's such a rarity to find all 3 in one restaurant.  That is, until I came across Congee Queen! For those not familiar, this is not a place that just sells congee! Their menu is vast and includes a variety of rice/noodle/congee dishes, as well as barbecued meats and traditional Chinese dishes. Their prices are very reasonable, given the quality of food you are getting. You can definitely find cheaper Chinese food, but you usually get what you pay for...  While the Centrepoint Mall location is not the first one I've tried, it's definitely one of the best. I believe it's the newest one of the chain, and it's very spacious with many large tables to accommodate bigger groups. The staff are not particularly warm and friendly, but this is on par with what you would expect at most other Chinese restaurants (unfortunately). The only other drawback to this location is that their drinks (in particular, their HK-style milk tea) is not as smooth and delicious as the Kennedy/Sheppard location. Milk tea enthusiasts take note!  Nonetheless, this location offers free delivery on orders above $25 for as far south as Yonge/Sheppard. A great place to dine-in or take out for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience.  Love the design.  Very calming decor, but the place---donyou want to test your patience?  You'll have to wait.  Take a number.  Get in line.  This place is busy. But the food speaks for itself.  Delicious--you know they worked up their kung fu magic in the kitchen--fast, but well-prepared.   Neat presentation.  Money goes by quickly in this joint because menu's awesome, and you just want to try everything.  So glad it's near my house."}
{"text":"I've been Coming to the congee queen restaurants chain since high school days (6+) years? It's always been a great place with great comfort food that doesn't break your bank. This place reminds me of keungs delight where there are many Cantonese dishes. Their dishes tend to have a lot in portion and is on the bigger side. This place is pretty big with lots of seating, but this place gets pretty busy during prime hours and even late at night like 9-10!   The selection is so wide and there's so many to choose from. Some of my favourite include the turnip patties, their congee, salted and peppered squid, and many of their fried rices are super good too. The environment is really nice and spacious with bright lights. Servers are super quick and so is the food. They're a bit rude sometimes but amazingly efficient."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated and big, but for some reason, every dish is about $3 more expensive than all the other congee restaurants, including Congee Time (5 min drive)."}
{"text":"I finally made it without any lines!! How? On weekdays, from 3-5 pm they have their version of HK happy hour. We went there for early dinner not realizing that they have a specific menu for this time. The bonus was that it came with a drink of your choice. They give you three choices.   We sat near the entrance and realized that a lot of the wooden tables had masking tape on them and some were warped more than others. So indeed I felt my noodle soup was a bit slanted downward. The middle area that had large tables were displayed nicely as it was probably granite made tables. They have three private areas that I saw. For being open more than 6 months, one can see their furniture, washroom and some walls already damaged/broken.   My bubble tea was not to my expectations as the tapioca was not chewy at all. It felt like it was cooked early in the morning and left to rest. The noodle soup was a bit bland and I was surprised that the BBQ duck came separately instead of being dunked into the soup. There was no colour or added veggies like some bok choy. My partner liked his deep fried pork chop and his original tea.   It wasn't too busy, so it wasn't that loud.  I still prefer the one on Steeles/Don Mills - they never disappoint.   Verdict: I would love to go back to try their other dishes in a group."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein, Empress Fried Rice, Beef with Mushroom on sizzling plate, turnip patties and seafood congee. All the dishes were good.   The stand out for me was the Cantonese chow mein which I like when it's crispy. I get first dibs on the crunchy noodles before it's mixed in with the sauce. The sauce is tasty and not too salty.     The Empress fried rice was good but I am still a big fan of the soft shell crab fried rice. The beef and mushroom is good and the smell always makes me more hungry and more big eyed.   As usual, needed to get the turnip patties and the seafood congee (not sure why, but they make a good combination if you aren't in the mood for the Chinese fried donuts).  The seafood congee has big chunks of seafood which included salmon and the turnip patties were equally as crunchy as the chow mein.   My theme for Congee Queen when I go is, 'The crunchier, the better!'"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just don't get why people love this place so much for dinner.  BBQ pork and duck are excellent, but the rest of everything are basically average.  Congee Queen can be great for lunches, because it is a congee-and-stir-fried-noodle restaurant.  However, its dinner menu is limited.  It has no fish dish for dinner at all, not even vegetable stir fried with fish filet.    Seating is good, and service is efficient. Food is okay but not that different from another restaurant.  I won't recommend waiting for half an hour to get a dinner table here."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is my go-to Chinese restaurant when friends visit. Its quality is consistently great, its service is fast and friendly, its atmosphere is normally busy and loud (like a lot of popular Chinese restaurants), and the prices are a little steep.  Things to definitely try:   BBQ Eel Fried Rice, the flagship fried rice dish of Congee Queen. I was in awe the first time I tried the dish, and it's almost never disappointed me. The portion is huge, and can certainly feed more than one person, which justifies it's steep price (~ 13$).  Deep fried squid, different than any other deep fried squid I've had. The pieces are large, the crumbing is white, and the flavor is amazing. The various peppers added really makes the flavor stand out.  BBQ Duck, probably the best I've ever had in Canada. In the back of the restaurant, you can see roasted BBQ ducks on a grill, and you can ask for an entire duck for takeout. The taste is very authentic, the sauce is good, and the meat is tender and juicy.  Some honorable mentions:  Shrimp wonton soup, any congee, (oil) breadsticks.  The food arrives extremely quickly, and the service is good. The place is almost always completely packed, so please book a reservation!"}
{"text":"I don't usually eat congee but this place was good.  It had lots varieties and they put a lot of meat/vegetables/whatever you ordered into the congee; so you're not eating just plain white congee unless that's what you ordered.  Their other items were also very good and huge portions."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is a reliable and dependable place to go for some solid Chinese food.  The menu is gigantic and has numerous finds & items to explore.   The food comes out quick because they probably make them in huge batches and the waiters are quick to serve you.  The servers could be nicer but hey, it's still a good place to go!  I usually get a carb, meat and appetizer for my visit there and that will fill me up.  You probably won't finish most of the food while sitting down so they'll give you a to-go box to pick everything up for some leftovers!  The restaurant is beautifully lit, clean and sanitary. Would definitely recommend to anyone as this location of Congee Queen is top notch."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, it's quite apparent that this location is much nicer than the sister restaurant, Congee Wong. But of course there's always give and take, and in this case I much prefer the food at Congee Wong. We ordered congee with peanuts and dried fish, which was very bland and watery. Considering the restaurant's name that was pretty disappointing. We also ordered snow pea leaves with garlic, which was fresh but also very bland. We also got mixed vegetable fried rice, which is very hard for a Chinese restaurant to get wrong but they it ended up being too oily and also bland. The shredded duck with pickled cabbage and vermicelli was also bland. I generously added salt but there's only so much salt can do for flavour. The only good dish there was the bbq duck which was perfectly cooked and not too fatty or firm."}
{"text":"Once we managed to get a hostess to notice us, and then managed to flag down a waitress, we ordered the minced beef congee and the Taiwanese style stir fired vermicelli with seafood. The congee was alright. Not the best which is ironic considering the restaurant's name. The vermicelli was pretty good. Overall the food was decent, but the service is pretty bad. They have enough waiters but they seem to actively avoid eye contact. I don't even care if they're polite or smile but at least try to help out customers instead of standing around."}
{"text":"I think this is the third congee queen I've been to! As usual the food is good, and the atmosphere is a step above most Chinese restaurants. This place seems super busy though. Everything we ordered was good although I can't think of anything that was outstanding (or bad). Portions were decent for the price paid. All in all this is a great place to have a cheap and quick Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Congee queen hit the spot after a five hour drive from Michigan! We arrived during a snow storm so the congee was perfect! Food and service was great! The interior was also nicely decorated. Price was super reasonable! I'm taking off one star because one of the congees we ordered was very bland. Tip: order the deep fried fritters (??) with your congee!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for dinner and it was pretty good! It was a bit more pricey compared to other Chinese restaurants, but the portions are huge here! The food was pretty good, but could have had a bit more flavour towards it. The service is amazing, the waiters always walk around and ask if you need anything (not to an extent where it got annoying), the only thing that the first waiter forgot was the water, however the second waiter remembered that. Whenever we needed something, we got it right away, including the food! I would come back here."}
{"text":"This place is always packed full of people, and for a good reason. Service is always great, and attentive, and food is brought out surprisingly quick. We never get the same thing twice, and have not been disappointed. Seems to be able to accommodate large groups, and family style dishes to share."}
{"text":"Worth the hype. Got the Chicken, duck and egg congee for take-out. Fast service, great food. The place was extremely crowded though, a lot of traffic in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Congee Queen on Lawrence is one of my favourite places for congee and other Chinese food. It's consistently great. We usually get the seafood congee. Last night we were in a bigger group so tried the friend turnip dish along with crab fried rice and shrimp curry. Exemplary! Lots of parking. Don Mills mall is right there. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Congee queen is one of my all time faves.  It's not for everyone but it's definitely for me.  One of my favorite things from the menu is the turnip patties.  They are seriously like crack.  I can eat those things like everyday.   They have a wide selection of things to eat from and the place is always packed no matter what time of the day.  Why?  Cus it's the bomb!!!!!  Gotta have Congee queen if ur in the area."}

{"text":"I was extremely suprised that this place is a franchise. I cannot express how much I enjoy this place. it reminds me of hong kong. Food is great and I love love love teir king size seafood congee, wontons, and spicy white carrot cakes. I was in heaven. Service is alright. I mean its an asian place. People go to restaurants for their food, not their service. I would highly recommend visiting if you're looknig for some good cantonese food."}
{"text":"I came here for the second time since the grand opening last week! It's great to know that more Chinese places are opening later to accommodate people like me who sometimes eat late!  This time, I decided to try other dishes that they offered. It's great that their menus also have pictures so you know exactly what you're ordering!! A plus for the restaurant.   I wasn't disappointed again with the food, and the food came out relatively quickly! So if you're hungry, don't worry, you won't have to wait long!  The deep fried squid in sea salt was good, the sweet and sour pork and shrimp was also great, fried to order so it's crunchy! I also want to mention the lightly fried sea bass dish. If you like buttery fish like I do, this fish is expensive if you buy it on your own in the supermarket, but their dish that's served with broccoli is at a reasonable price! Try it out!  There were some dishes that were on the saltier side such as the vermicelli but the flavour was there. I thought the vegetable fried rice was a unique dish with the mixing of the two rices, but I'm not a fan of using frozen mixed vegetables which they did and it didn't taste as good when you know the mixed vegetables in the fried rice is not fresh!   Don't forget, this place can take reservations and if your prty is big, they have big tables in a semi private room just for your big party too!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I have ever had in my life. The honey garlic wings had actual honey and garlic shavings, not some fake honey garlic sauce. The general Tao chicken was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The rice noodles with satay sauce had the yumiest grill flavour. Excellent service and good price. Would definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"I was invited by a work colleague to try this place out for lunch the other day. At first I was a little hesitant because I thought this restaurant only had congee, I have never tried it because it just doesn't sound appealing to me but I'm sure one day I will. When my coworker told me that it has tones of other Chinese dishes I was in.   When we arrived I was shocked to see the place packed and a waiting list as well. We were able to get seated right away. I told my friend to decide since I have never been there before. She decided on the General Tao Chicken, Pad Thai, and Fried Chili Turnip Patties. When the food came we did receive our Pad Thai. We waited until it was time to leave. We asked for the bill and told them we didn't have time for the Pad Thai as we had to go. They still tried to bring it out but we refused because 45 min late is not acceptable. They eventually understood and removed the item from the bill.  The meal was full of flavour, and cooked to perfection. The entire meal was a decent price for the amount of food we received. The total came to $20 before tip.   This is great place to go to enjoy a variety of items in a group setting while not breaking the bank.   I would definitely will return when I have a bit more time other than my lunch hour to really enjoy the atmosphere and culture of this place."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, late hours. No issues. Good flavour in the food and the food was brought out relatively quickly. The restaurant is beautiful, well decorated offering an inviting ambiance. I recommend this restaurant if you happen to be reading my review or in the area.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"The salmon fried rice on the special menu was delicious! The quantity of salmon you get is totally worth the price.   Their dishes are of good quality with lots of ingredients beyond just pure rice and noodle. Best of all, they give large portions."}
{"text":"This is one of the many Congee Queens now in the city and I am genuinely surprised that the quality of the food and service is quite consistent between them. If anything, I think this one is even better.   The location is great and the restaurant is in a large space. Even on a crowded night with 10 tables ahead of you in line, the wait is usually no more than 15 - 20 minutes.   The reason why I like this place so much is because of its consistency in food and service. I can always expect large portions, fast service, and decent quality food. I've been to other restaurants that lack quality when it gets late at night - but not here. It's open quite late so a great place to grab a bite after a long day out.   Their large bowls of congee are heart warming and full of different ingredients. Makes for a nice treat on a cold day. The mixed vegetables are a safe bet and tastes great when fried with garlic. The BBQ pork noodles or rice never fails to hit the spot."}
{"text":"I was craving Cheung fun after the gym and well CQ has it. I didn't wanna wait in line nor was I planning to dine in by myself so I called ahead to make a take out order.   Only ordered two things Beef ho fun and beef Cheung fun.   The portions for the bigger dishes ie noodles and rice, is not worth to order to go imo. The portion looked a lot smaller vs when you dine in. The noodles I got wasn't anything too special. Tastes generic. So did the Cheung fun but I really liked the steam roll.   Cheung fun comes with 2 containers of sauces! Though I wish they would add more peanut sauce instead of hoisin.   I also ordered a cold milk tea while I was waiting a few mins for my food. I think portions are smaller when you order to go and for what I paid for, it was quite expensive. I've had better milk tea. E"}
{"text":"Congee queen has the most quantity and best quality food even when it's busy. I would definitely recommend this place if you don't know what to get because this restaurant has just about anything."}
{"text":"We've been to a couple different Congee Queens when we are up here visiting... This one is by far the best.  Cons: service is odd? Not super friendly and they try to not make eye contact with you. However it was a madhouse for 5 pm so I'll give them that.  Pros: *seafood fried rice with the Bonita flakes on top... Oh so yum! *seafood Congee. Wasn't expecting much but it tasted so good. *white plain rolled noodles (cheung fan) with sauce. A total hit for kids. *salt and pepper squid... Yum!  The Pokemon craze exist here too..."}
{"text":"Ok, so the hype is OUTRAGEOUS for this place and not really justifiable.  We ordered vegetable chow mein- it was good.  Roasted Duck- really good  Ginger Garlic Lobster- tasteless/very bland and cold. Wouldn't order again- would only go to Tremendous restaurant for lobster.  House special Congee- had weird kinds of fish- would never order again. Also very bland.  Taro bubble tea- AWFUL. First, they dropped a couple of melted ice cubes in the end so it wasn't cold, then the tapioca was soggy. Don't do it.   The BBQ spare ribs were the worst ribs I've had in a long time. They're pretty much stale ribs that have a bottle of HEINZ BBQ/ketchup mixture on top and served on a sizzling plate to trick you into thinking they're fresh.   Also, customer service is non-existent. For non-Asian folk- you must raise your hand or call ANYONE passing by to ask for ANYTHING- from hot sauce to napkins to the check. These were the instructions explained to us by the manager after we sat there for 25 minutes waiting for a waiter to order. It's just a weird place.   The stars go to the duck. If I go again, it's for the duck. And I'd only take it to go."}
{"text":"Decent place for chinese food, fast food style. We  Like to get congee , seafood fried rice, turnip cakes, and noodles.  Same quality of food every time, quick service. Suitable for a quick bite"}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place as I've heard nothing but good things. Mississauga doesn't have many good asian places, so my family (and friends) will trek up to Richmond Hill/Markham for food. I'm glad they decided to open a decent place here.  We got here a bit before 2 and had about 5-10 min wait for a party of 3. I was surprised it was quite full for a Tuesday afternoon, but I guess all the asians in sauga were waiting for this? The interior is beautiful, high ceilings and lots of light. The space looked very spacious, and there's a little private area, which I imagine is perfect for larger groups or if you want a semi private setting (although service might be slower).  The tables were all either marble (potentially faux, but I didn't get seated at one to check it out) or wood. Since it's still a new place, the seats were new and nicely cushioned, more modern than typical chinese restaurants here.  They had BBQ pork and hanging ducks, which I hope to come back and give a try.  We ordered the pork and preserved egg congee, Empress fried rice and the Ha Moon Vermicelli (sweet and sour). All the food had lots of flavor, and saucier than I had expected. My group had lots of water and tea with our food. The portions were good and we even left with leftover vermicelli and rice. They add the dried fish skins (the stuff they add on top of takoyaki) on the Empress fried rice, so if you're not a fan of that (like me) -- just be aware of that. The Ha Moon vermicelli had bell peppers and some other veggies that I am not accustomed seeing in this dish, but it added nice colors and textures to the noodles. The congee was really nice. It wasn't runny or watery, or lacking flavor like at other places. It was just the right amount of thickness and quite comforting.  Service was slow. It is a huge place, and all the servers were running around so I feel for them. But we had asked about 4 different servers for water and didn't get it until we were almost done our meal. Our tea refill also took a while to come, but I appreciate how they keep the tea boiling hot in the thermos vs the conventional tea pots (you can't choose tea though).   I'm definitely going to come back and give other dishes a try, I would imagine weekends and evenings will be packed as it seems all the asians (and non asians alike) are hearing the hype about this place and flocking to give it a try since it's closer to home. This place is slightly more expensive than other places in sauga, but given the ambiance and i guess the branding, it's worth it imo."}
{"text":"Being a fan of congee, Congee queen is my 'go-to' place in Markham for chinese food.   My family and I rarely go out to eat but when we do, this is the place we go. Once you order, the food comes quickly from the kitchen. Service is normal for the amount of people that are in the restaurant. Wait times are usually decent too, around 10-15 minutes for a table of 5. The environment is always loud and you will hear dishes clattering, but that is typical of an Chinese restaurant.   As for the food, I usually order one bowl of small congee (enough for 5 people). Their 6 grain congee is health in a bowl. It can be a bit more on the bland side, but it is a good break from some of their other oily options.   Their fried oysters are usually a staple in our congee queen order. The Pan fried turnip cakes are usually a hit or miss; they can come out golden brown or just sallow.   Overall, a good place if you want to go to a sit down restaurant and be in and out quickly."}
{"text":"So here we are thinking we've discovered a 4 star Yelp rated  super amazing Chinese spot and man were we disappointed.  The infamous calamari was soaked in oil and soggy to a point we ended up returning it. We had bbq duck /pork it was awesome.  The curry chicken and rice was subpar. .the wonton soup was bang on. The Cantonese chowmein was ok. Now the overall experience was not bad..the waitstaff are good and they were friendly.  I know people enjoy fast service but this place is too fast with your orders and they have no clue on how to pace your order so that everything you've ordered stays nice and hot. 85%of our experience was eating lukewarm food or cold so not cool when you're spending nearly $50 for 2. Anyhow, hopefully this helps."}
{"text":"Recently, I've visited this location with a friend for lunch. Food quality was consistent and good. I enjoy eating their congee, even though I can't finish it by myself as the portion is huge. I also ordered their sticky rice dish once, and although that was good, I must say that the Markham location makes it better.   I deducted a star because every time I come here, the servers are... not the greatest. They seem to be lovely with other customers, but when they approach my table, they seem less friendly. It might be because all the other customers are elderly whenever I come here, but who knows?   Otherwise, this place is good for groups of all sizes and is very nicely decorated compared to other Asian establishments. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different congee queen and this is probably the worst one. First we went on a regular sunday evening and it was overly crowded. In the entrance, there were lots people standing there waiting for tables. In my opinion, this kind of food is NOT worth to line up for.   Second, we ordered around 8 dishes, include Cantonese chow mien, stir fried veggies, onion with beef etc, they all overly sauced and the sauce was so thick with no  flavor except the cornstarch they use to thicken the sauce.   I remember ordering the same dishes in other congee queen location and they tasted better. I would NOT want to go back this place for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast  on our last day of the trip. Nice decoration. Everything on the picture menu looks so good!!  Pumpkin shark fin soup - bit bland, not too impressed  Shredded chicken/duck with egg super bowl congee - looks simple, but the flavor was a WOW!!  Pan fried shrimp steam rice noodle - Can't beat $3.50 for a large plate of delicious tasty rice noodle with peanut/oyster sauce  Salt and pepper fish filet - Portion was way too big for three ppl, but the flavor was good.   Overall, love the chinese breakfast style food. Large portion and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with some family and ordered a plain congee (they are afterall self-proclaimed Congee Queen), their fried squid legs, pea tips with mushroom and tofu and cod in a pot.  This all came to $60 not including tip which was quite pricey.  Nothing really stood out.  I prefer pea tips to be stir fried.  The squid was tasty but so greasy and tofu and cod pot was greasy as well. Their congee is good but I expected more from Congee Queen."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints because it's always consistently good. The turnip dim sum is delicious here, and love the congee!"}
{"text":"I like to stay in this area for the chinese food and will try as much as I can new. This seem like a new place and ordered congee but I got pumkin congee which was pretty good anyway. Chicken was great too. Very inexpensive. I would go back if in the area."}
{"text":"What can I say. The food was really good and well portioned and the pricing was superb. Definitely worth the 2 hour drive from the states! Definitely my favorite go to dimsum/chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Prices went up recently,  about 1-2 bucks on each item. food is about average, nothing special"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. Definitely have the house super bowl congee. It's enough for 2 people!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have takeout food even more. I've tried most of the food here and they are always good. The food here is on the saltier side, that doesn't mean that it is not delicious. The roasted pork is the best so far compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area. I love their customized noodle soup combo where you can choose your own soup base, noodle, topping and drink. You can even add a small side dish for an additional cost. I got the peanut soup based with thick noodle and sliced beef. The portion here is huge and I can never finish it all by myself."}
{"text":"I went to this place several times with friends and family. This place is pretty famous. I consider it as fancy in Chinese restaurant standard. It costs around 15 per person. I think it got best congee in Toronto. It is a good place to have a Guangdong-style family / street food."}
{"text":"Congee Queen is the OG Chinese restaurants of Chinese restaurants, and the revisit I had today really proved they're still on top of their game. In Markham you'd think it's so easy to find a good Chinese restaurant, but legit I can't think of any except CQ. I'd also categorize CQ as a \"family\" restaurant as the portions are really big and easy to share.   This CQ is tucked away in the Captain Boil/Kiku plaza in the back. It is very large and spacious and has a nice modern Asian design. Nice, clean bathrooms too.   With 4 adults and one baby, we ordered fried rice, chow mein, small size congee with liver, mixed vegetables, and a large plate of bbq meats. We had A LOT left over! A whole extra meal for the 4 of us after.   Fried Rice - I actually didn't try this because I was too focused on my chow mein.   Chow Mein - 5 out of $?!@ing 5. So good. Do you see that glaze in the sauce??? Best chow mein I've had in a really long time. They were very generous with their toppings and the ratio between noodles and toppings was BEAUTIFUL.   Congee with Liver - 4/5. Very good as well. I couldn't eat too much of this because I was stuffed, but the liver was well done and this dish was solid.   Mixed Veg - 4/5. Very traditional and had a good medley of veggies. Yummy.   Plate of BBQ - 3/5. The most disappointing dish for me. I actually didn't know they do the traditional bbq stuff in house. They had jellyfish in the centre and I started salivating right there. It's a shame that it is the kind that comes prepackaged in grocery stores and was extremely salty and inedible. It's not the same as the ones you get from Chinese Banquet dinners (My Asian peeps will understand). The chicken was very good, the crispy pork was good, cha siu was decent, and lastly the duck was ok but had lots of bones. This dish was $40~ and I wouldn't order it again.   All in all, service was great and I really enjoyed this visit. They cleaned up their menu and it was a great experience. 4/5."}
{"text":"Even with a reservation, we had to wait more than 1 hour. Way too busy. There's many other Congee Queen's around Toronto. I'd suggest going to one of those instead."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Can get very busy with long wait times during regular lunch and dinner times. Pretty consistent quality with their other locations."}
{"text":"So, the food here never disappoints.  Every dish I have eaten here has always been delicious and on point. Because the food is so good, the restaurant is generally busy.  Expect a long line up at peak time.  What is not so on point is this system of waiting.  You are given a piece of paper with a number on it, and you wait for the number to be called.  The problem is that the restaurant is very noisy, but they don't have a microphone to call out the numbers.  As a result, it is super hard to hear your number being called out, which was what happened to my friends and I.  We missed our number being called even though we were listening out for it.  When we asked the associate about our number, he said he already called our number.  The frustration after waiting in line already for a while."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a while now.  This is my default congee place (well it is a toss up between here and Sam Woo BBQ actually), but I do like the congee here better.  I really don't like the hours of this establishment though, because I can't get a breakfast congee as it opens at 10:30am which is too late already.  However, I did wait for my B15 (preserved egg and shredded pork congee).  Something about their base makes it taste better, it is like they added some extra broth (which may add to the MSG level but it is not high enough to make me sense it).  They have a lot of other dishes that I actually like, but I'd like to review based on most recent experiences rather than past.  Also no free WiFi."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for a while and decided to see what they have that won't violate my diet too much.  For the most part most of the food being congee or noodles or excessively deep ffried would violate my diet.   In the end I chose two dishes. The Crab and seaweed salad and the seafood and veggie wrap. They were listed as spicy but the waitress who understands English understood that I wanted it less or no spice if possible. They were able to do it successfully.   One thing I noticed here was the people that Ed to be in the old Don Mills and Steeles location seems to have moved here. At the very least the good ones. Seems like the young waiter that was in the old place is now a manager here. And it is run very well. Having staff that understood English is a major bonus.   Getting back to the food. The salad was awesome to say the least. It wasn't overtly spicy but it did have a slight kick.   The seafood and veggie wraps were good too. The lettuce they used was selected properly in that they were all solid bowl shaped. I've been to other places where I eat the veggie wrap portion of the Peking duck and have whatever random pieces of lettuce thrown in.   They were able to make it with no spice at all, just the way I like it.   Service was excellent even if I had to assemble the wrap myself.   The portions were large. One dish would've likely been sufficient for the two of us so we had to take a bit home.   The price wasn't too bad for the fact that we ordered their specials rather than the standard fare food.   I wish they had free wifi but I guess you can't have everything."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner...food was great and service was spectacular. Food came quick and the servers dealt with our issues professionally.  We ordered abalone clam and chicken congee, crab meat and seaweed salad, and a flat rice noodle with garoupa and pork. The congee was average, but the salad was amazing. It was fresh and tasty.   One problem we had with the noodles was that the fish had a lot of bones in it - not what we signed up for. We asked our server if we could switch for another dish, and the manager agreed to let us slide one time. It really goes to show how this establishment knows how to cater to its customers.  I will be coming here again!!!"}
{"text":"Food here is very good. Great selection on the menu and large portions. Had the salt and pepper tofu which was excellent along with the salty and spicy pepper shrimp. Service is very cool and indifferent. When we asked for menu suggestions, the waitress looked at us like we were crazy. Food does come fast though."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on a Sunday morning around 11:30 am. We weren't really craving much so we had the scallop and tiger shrimp congee ($8.50) and the two BBQ assortment on rice ($10.95).   First off, it took a really long time for the server to serve us. We basically had to wave someone down, which took many tries! This place wasn't even busy at the time, there were probably around 6 tables. The server took our order very quickly and returned with our congee. 10 mins later, we were served with the two BBQ assortment.. just the two. However, we asked for this on rice. So, it took another 10 mins to wave a serve down (multiple tries again)!   When we waved the server down for the bill they came back with the higher priced two assortment BBQ dish, so then it took another 10 mins to wave someone down. By this time, it was already 12:3x, and getting very busy, and people were all lined up at the door. The server did not really understand what was wrong with our bill due to our poor chinglishness/language barrier, so it took around 5 mins of talking back and forth till he understood. Anyways, we paid, and required change, and again, the service was so slow... I was beginning to think they took our change as tip (which would constitute as about 30% tip)... anyways, we got it back in the end..!   Other than the service, the food was pretty typical!"}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday so it wasn't so busy. The place was clean and roomy. We ordered egg white, fish stomach, and crab congee (which I loved), some eel fried rice, half a chicken, and chinese broccoli with beef. All in all it was good, not too salty, the way I like it. Service was great, possibly because my friend knew someone who worked here! I would come back if I was around the area."}
{"text":"Went here for a huge family dinner, must've ordered something like thirty dishes. Food comes out fast, hot, and brusquely served, just like at every good Chinese restaurant. It's a standby for Cantonese families across the GTA.  Cheap, authentic, and take-out is great."}
{"text":"Cool concept for a restuarant. You don't see places like this in L.A. This place specializes in different styles of porridge. And, it's open late like cafes here in L.A.   The cousins brought us here on our first night landing in Toronto. It was a nice meal coming off a long enough flight and was definitely a comfort food. Not only do they serve Jook or... \"Congee,\" they had other family style dishes as well."}
{"text":"Possibly the largest location they have.  Ordered take out including the xo sauce fried rice noodles with beef and a penny jot sauce lo mein.   The rice noodles were good but the lo mein was fairly mediocre.  Wasn't spicy at all and lacked any real flavour.   Not as good as the don mils location.  Service was friendlier though."}
{"text":"Solid choice for Chinese food in the North York area.  Large menu that includes dim sum and soup dumplings that rivaled Din Tai Fung.  Had a going away lunch for a coworker here and we ordered family style.  I left overstuffed and my portion of the bill was $15.  Not too shabby.  Definitely can't rival places in Chinatown or Richmond Hill, but for the North York neighborhood it'll get an A-OK."}
{"text":"I go to this location very often. Service has always been consistent and good.  Same goes for food quality.  Favourites are the wonton noodle soup, their special BBQ eel fried rice, and the calamari.  Price is fair too.  It gets pretty busy at lunchtimes of course, so consider ordering take out.  Have not tried their delivery service."}
{"text":"Within 15mins of where I live, there are 6 Congee places.  This location of Congee Queen makes it 7. Friends of mine prefers this location over the others and I decided to give it a whirl. I went, I ordered, I ate...It was just...meh.  As expected, much like all the others. The Beef with Mushrooms, onions, and ginger on a sizzling plate was a standout but all the rest were just average. The place is in the old BRIX restaurant location.  They renovated the restaurant and it looks nice.  It's good to see Chinese restaurants trying to stay trendy to keep a head of the competition. This place has very little parking for such a large food mall.  We had to park in the next parking lot over.  Expect waits of 15-30mins on busy nights."}
{"text":"Love  this place and best to go with a big group of people so you can get many different plates and share.  Eat in has much bigger portions than take out in my experience.  Food is served steaming hot and fresh.  Service is not always the greatest but makes up for it with great food.  My top recommendations are the Fried Turnip (to die for!!! Trust me) The beef with mushroom and onion and the general tsao chicken.  The menu is so big so still have to get through it with my future visits.  Whatever you do have that friend turnip!  Caution: we tend to order way too Much food so if staff say to you it's a lot trust them they are right!"}
{"text":"Yeah I love this place. Its our go to ALWAYS. Can't decide where to go?  We always end up here.  Parking: There are a tonne of parking spots but people want to save 30 seconds and circle and block traffic and argue trying to park at the door. Stop being so lazy People, there are hundreds of spots. Chillax  Decor: Kind fancy for the typical Asian restaurants in the hood.  Although the place is super casual you can get away with this being a celebration place. Its also really clean and the washrooms are good. Yeah!  Food:  So there are hundreds of items on the menu. I have no idea how they do it but everything comes out fresh made, hot, and correct ( at least I've never had a mistake). Also my friend hates onions so we have to alter so.e dishes and they all come out fresh and fast without onions. I'm always amazed. I picture 50 people working in the kitchen. Although I've been told it probably more like 6 or 8.   My favourite dishes are the BBQ pork rice rolls, turnup patties, 5 grain fried rice, sweet and sour pork, and bean curd with veg. oh and the duck congee. Yummy!  Staff: Nice but are way to busy to smile at you. I saw someone smile once and I've seen them since so our theory that if they smile at you they will be fired isn't true.   Cost: Table full of food. 50 bucks. Not bad at all!!  See you there"}
{"text":"Ok food. Service could be better. I like the fried rice with eel. It's cconvenient to go to Shops at Don Mills and walk around before or after."}
{"text":"Fabulous. Quick service, huge portions and the food was not too salty like many of the Chinese restaurants back in NYC.  Great noodle dishes and congee.  Their fried cruller was very fresh.  They have a large array of menu items so there will be something for everyone."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating at this location as there is a variety of selection as in all Congee Queen locations. However, it is often very crowded. We like the noodles, rice and also bbq meat dishes. Our often go-to is the yin-yang rice which is a mix of creamy rice with seafood and tomato sauce with chicken slices, the wonton noodles, XO turnip cakes, BBQ pork and duck, the congees and also the spinach with mushroom dishes. You cannot go wrong with most of their dishes, they are packed with flavour, and the quality is always consistent. The prices are more pricier than some places in Scarborough for chinese food but still decent."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the better congee queens. It's very spacious, has alot of parking the the plaza and the portion sizes are huge! This place is a family dinner favourite. During dinner hours it's loud and bustling and has a long wait line so get there early. For standard Cantonese dishes this place is very decent.  They also have a selection of thai fusion and pho on their menu. That one time my father decided he wanted pho but everyone else wanted congee, this place was ideal and you definitely get your bang for your buck if you dine in. If you do take out obviously the portion size gets a little smaller but not by much for most dishes :) they delivery to a wide area, I've been here in the last few years; I also ordered delivery when I'm too lazy to go out,/. Minimum $25 before tax is a lot of food and the portions are not small, a regular congee for take out is like 2 small tubs, the large is two large tubs and that only max $15. Overall a great place :)"}
