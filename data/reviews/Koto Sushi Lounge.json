{"text":"The food is nice., not a lot of choice, but it's fair. I often go there for lunch, as it's close to where I work, and it's almost always packed. 
Went there a few times in the evening hours with the Groupon.. and no matter when you go.... the service is SOOOOO bad. If only that would improve, the place would be one of the nice spots in Calgary.
I've seen a lot of reviews mentioning that, and will never understand how the owner doesn't care.
I also agree that the service is much worse when you go with a groupon."}
{"text":"Our group of six arrived for dinner on a Monday evening. The restaurant was not busy (probably only four to five other tables the entire time we were there) and though the service was friendly, they were not attentive or proactive. For example, we ordered numerous dishes and when the plates were empty, we had to ask the waitress a couple times to remove them. We even stacked the dishes in front of us before resorting to asking the waitress since we were running out of table space for the next entr√©es. When dessert was served, we reminded our waitress to provide utensils since none were available. Overall, the food was decent, but the service could use significant improvement especially since the restaurant was not busy. We do not plan on returning."}

Our first visit 8 months ago was great. Fresh food, great service. Thats all changed. The tempura is often uncooked like raw dough, the rolls have way to much rice around them, the calamari was like chewing a tire. 
The worst part is the music. The same crap R&B cd every time, and it loops. We hear the same tracks twice during the same meal. 
I wipe my hands of this place"}
{"text":"New venue to Calgary sushi scene. Convenient location. Street parking in abundance, free after 18:00. Cool configuration and nice room with great decor. Service is friendly with lots of energy and efficiency. Sushi, both nigiri and rolls, very good. Unagi, on its own or in a roll, was exceptionally good. Refreshing to have a new and tasty place for sushi, in a city that needs it."}

Their fusion large rolls are interesting (lobster, soft shell crab with mango) and is well worth it. Well, worth it if you have a groupon :)"}

I'm a return customer every month!"}
{"text":"Quick summary: good food. Great service. I will return.

Long summary. Visited koto at approx 6pm on a monday. Place was fairly empty. Me and my brother sat at a both. Server asked if we had a reservation (we didn't) and then sat us where we asked to be seated. Food was very good. I wouldn't say great. Except the rainbow rolls. Those were excellent!

I'm not sure about prices as my brother paid.

Service was good, but the place was empty so anything less than great service would have received comments here. :)
 i do understand a little about waiting though. As we left (around 7) i noticed quite a few people waiting at the host podium (6-10 people) while the restaurant was still empty. That would've irked me had I been waiting."}
{"text":"Went to Koto with Groupon voucher; the food is terrible and price is too high.  I would not recommend coming back even with the voucher."}
{"text":"I have been here four times now, and am somewhat surprised at the existing reviews.  I will admit that we were not really watching our wallet, as we have always come with discounted on-line deal certificates.

Koto is a contemporary Western-style sushi restaurant.  You go there for the same reason you go to see a rock opera: you don't need to be an expert to appreciate it, because it's not subtle. The real stand outs here are the creative (but pricier) rolls that successfully incorporate bold flavours (e.g. mango, jalapeno) into good quality traditional (eel, tuna, etc.) and Western (e.g. lobster) fare.  These rolls do not need soy or wasabi to feel complete.

The rice has been consistently excellent in our rolls.  I will agree with a previous reviewer that the roll ends can be a bit messy, but not egregiously so.  The service has always been acceptable for us, and (at least currently) they actually have Japanese people on staff...a rarity in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great place, sushi is really fresh and tasty (we only ordered rolls but they were amazing). The food quality improved lots since we were here about a year ago. And it is now consistent, we're coming here regularly once in a couple weeks. Presentation is really nice, too. A bit pricey, but not if you get a groupon ;)"}
{"text":"Waitress at the reception is awfully rude. She doesn't smile often. My first 3 visits there food was impeccable! Usually their specialty rolls are good I love their mango roll but last time I was there the food just tasted old and dry. The waitress apologized after a long wait. The food quality has definitely gone down."}

The service is pretty nice because we ate when it wasnt busy yet so im not sure if 20% tip is deserving if its busy. Also, its better to get the groupon coupon because itll save you a lot of $$$."}

{"text":"Let me just start by saying that my favourite dish in this restaurant was the green salad. I think that gives you a pretty good idea of how this review is going to go.

We came here with a Groupon for $25 for $50 on a Friday evening. The restaurant wasn't really that busy, although we didn't let that factor in how we thought of the place.

We ordered the scallops as an appetizer, along with the green salad. The scallops were heavily battered and coated with a very generic sweet and sour sauce, which made the fried batter very soggy. I did not like it at all.

All the rolls we ordered were sub-par at best, and all the fish smelled very fishy and not fresh. It wasn't better than the rolls we could make ourselves. 

Everything was very overpriced for its quality, and I am not surprised that they're not very busy. 

I would not be coming here again."}

HAhaha and don't get me started on how bad they treated groupon users...~15 open tables and groupon people had to wait.

If you think the sushi here is truly 4 stars, you truly have never had decent sushi before. Or you just don't know what good sushi is. Whatevz, i don't judge."}

Too greasy and low quality.

{"text":"A friend and I decided to try this place out for lunch since it was half way between our work places. True to (new) form, I check up on some Yelp reviews for this place and it didn't sound promising - uh oh!

When I arrived, I went to the hostess to check in and she informed me that my friend had already been seated . . . and then pointed in the general direction where our table was (I thought it was customary in any restaurant to be brought to your table?)

I thought the decor had a nice Japanese feel to it (stone statues and Asian artwork), the set up for the restaurant wasn't ideal if you're looking to have a conversation with whoever you're dining with. The back area (where we sat) isn't sectioned out so it rows of booths alongside the walls and then a long row of tables sandwiched between the booths. This made it ridiculously loud with the busy lunch crowd there. It was quite frustrating to have to constantly ask my friend to repeat what she was saying - and she was sitting right across from me!

We ordered our food: coconut tempura shrimp, salmon sake (3 pieces), unagi (1 piece), spicy salmon roll, spicy tuna roll (my friend enjoys tuna so she ordered this one for herself) and another spicy roll (I can't remember exactly what was in it but it had avocado and jalapeno on top)

The tempura shrimps were small but tasty. The sushi was good, but not amazing. My friend convinced me to give the spicy tuna roll a try. I for one don't like tuna - I find it really fishy and the texture is slimy and gritty at the same time. My friend says that's indicative of BAD tuna . . . 
We both grabbed a piece, dipped it into our soy sauce and immediately after putting the tuna in my mouth I spat it out. There it was - an overly rancid fishy taste and the off putting texture! 

I'm not sure if it was because it was busy or just how the service is at Koto but our waitress never came around until we were done eating (except for the tuna roll that sat there . . .) and our tea cups were bone dry. She asked if we wanted the tuna packed, which I informed her it didn't taste right. She took the roll and said she would check with the chef. When she returned (with bill in hand) she said that the tuna was made fresh that morning and asked if we'd eaten there before? My friend responded that we hadn't, but that shouldn't make a difference since she frequently eats tuna and there was clearly something wrong with the one we got. 

The waitress passed us our bill and said she took the roll off our bill (bonus!), but when we flipped over the receipt our excitement quickly faded. $50 for 4 pieces of sushi, 2 rolls and an appetizer?! W . . .T . . .F . . .

There are many restaurants downtown that have slightly bloated prices, but their fantastic food and service make up for it. Koto is definitely not one of them . . ."}
{"text":"Koto is a good sushi place.  Fish is always good and a pleasant atmosphere.  Not the greatest sushi in the world but good enough to keep me coming back.  Only problem is they don't know how to seat people efficiently.  They always seem confused and you end up waiting in line for 10 minutes while they sort out seating the person in front of you."}
{"text":"Well my standby sushi place seems to be slipping a bit, toro wasn't great(small), like they were preserving what they had left to serve. It just seems they don't put enough effort into the rolls either.

Service was fine, as per normal.
Prices are okay, but quality seemed below average today.
This place can be hit or miss i find, as i have come here 20-30 times over the last couple years.
And will continue to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"I will never eat from this place again! I ordered the vegetarian combo for takeout and got severe food poisoning. The sushi was warm and slathered in what appeared to be a mayonnaise sauce. I was starving and ate it against my better judgement. Their food is over priced and unsafe to eat. Patrons beware."}
{"text":"As a sushi fanatic, I love trying different restaurants. The reason for the 1 star is the lack of customer service and the poor quality of food. The sashimi wasn't fresh, partially frozen when it came out. The sushi was over priced and came in very small quantities, and the service was lacking.

To elaborate, the dynamite roll was cold, stale, and just plain disgusting..

The waitress never asked us how was our food, nor came by to refill waters. 

I am not a fan, and will not be coming back.. Don't come here to if you are wanting authentic Japanese food or if you are wanting QUALITY food. They do not offer it here."}
{"text":"Was here this past Thursday evening, and was using a Groupon I had purchased a couple of weeks beforehand. 

Parking first off, is street parking and if you go before 6 p.m. On a week night be prepared to walk at least a block. 

We're greeted at the door, and asked if we had a reservation. I just told her we called from the car and someone on the phone aid to just come over. ( it's a big space and only one other table was occupied.)

I have to say, that the food itself was presented nicely but overall the taste didn't exactly blow me away.

The prices are IMO, steep and the portions don't reflect the price. 

 The service was just okay. No one really stood out, and they seem to be again IMO a little indifferent.  

Also in concluding my review, I noticed that by the time we finished dinner about 4 other tables were seated ALL Groupon users. 

I knew this because the tables had printed out Groupon. (Coupons). 

This is the second time a restaurant has done this to us. (Seating Groupon users together.)

Overall the food I would have to say was average and I won't be returning to Koto anytime soon."}
{"text":"Brutal client experience.  Was seated then ignored for 10 minutes while my stomach growled.  Left without trying any food.  See ya - hope you enjoyed texting your friends while I spent $ somewhere else.
Too Bad as I went there specifically cuz of Yelp review."}
{"text":"Good sushi but very offensive customer service. The waitress was so annoying . Never go there again."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh but rice was undercooked and not steamed properly so it was grainy and not right for sushi. I thought it was brown rice. The fish did not stick well and pieces fell apart. Not bad but I still have not found exceptional sushi in Calgary; still looking."}
{"text":"Most other reviews are useful. So I'll just add that the $27 sashimi was horrible. I got pieces of fish that I couldn't even chew through."}
{"text":"I don't usually like the Japanese restaurants located in the downtown area, because I feel that most of these restaurants are not as authentic.....I feel that these restaurants would cater to certain group of people.  But Koto surprises me.  My friend got a coupon from Groupon, so we decided to use it and give it a try. 

Koto has a quite a selection on the menu.  The food is fresh.  The size of the sashimi and rolls are pretty big.  Overall I am satisfied with the freshness and taste of the food.  Price is reasonable as well.  

However, our waitress was not very attentive.  When we requested her to bring us.....let's say, a bowl of rice, she would be gone before we finish our sentence.  But then later, she would come back to confirm if it is one bowl of rice we need or one bowl for each.  That would be fine too to confirm, but again, before we could finish our sentence.....she's gone....like wind.....  So, some people would say that's called efficient, but I just didn't appreciate that kinda efficiency."}
{"text":"I usually go to the sushi restaurant near our building but Groupon had a deal so I thought I'd check it out. The deal was $25 for $50, it was definitely a waste of $25 and more. The service was about a 2 out of 5 and so is the food. I don't know if it's because of our Groupon but the chef loaded on the rice on every order, including the lobster roll. And actually, even though there was a lobster tail shell on our roll, I'm thinking the chef used shrimp instead. The \"lobster\" meat was small and I couldn't even taste it because they used so much rice. We also ordered eel, yellow tail, and calamari roll; all had too much rice and the calamari was way too chewy. 

I thought the main reason for getting a Groupon was to introduce people to the restaurant...This was the first time for my visit and will be my last."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment for a 2nd time on Saturday, 14 July because I had a Groupon.

My previous visit was several months earlier during lunch where I did try the Organic Miso Soup among other dishes. That was interesting as it was kind of salty but still good.

The service was not bad. It was reasonably attentive but not overly friendly. The waitress did make sure that we had drinks and food ordered in a timely manner.

The atmosphere is very swanky and there was only 20 and 30 somethings in the place as was pointed out on another website. The music is played at reasonable volume and the lighting is appropriate.

The restaurant is easy to find and parking is not a problem, at least on the weekend.

We ordered the following:

Large Sapporo with 2 glasses
Assorted Sashimi
Koto Seafood Sunomono (in a nice glass and very very tasty with fresh tasting noodles).
Seared Tuna Roll
Spicy Tuna Roll
Volcano Roll
Alaska Roll (or something similar with salmon over a california type roll with imitation crab)

We also had a roll with tempura in it which was really good.

The food was fresh. Like someone else mentioned, the spicy is different in every sushi establishment. I, too, prefer the siracha (spelling?) type spice. Additionally, as previously mentioned, imitation crab is used instead of real crab. For the price, one would expect the real deal.

While this was not as good as Taiko on Denman in Vancouver (which due to rents, has closed) or Tojo's on Broadway (super upscale, also in Vancouver), I would definitely say it is 4 stars.

The only other restaurant that I have been to that is on the same level is Towa Sushi in Calgary though I would say Towa is a level or two higher for about the same price. Still, Koto is worth checking out on an ongoing basis."}
{"text":"I've been to koto several times now but only with Groupon vouchers. I believe the food is good but good enough to pay full price."}
{"text":"If you have expensive taste with the budget to match this place might be for you. I had a Groupon for $50 and the bill was over $90 for 3 people (including tip). We had the Salmon Miso Soup, takoyaki, salmon sashimi the Dragon Roll, Yummy Yaki Roll and a spicy tuna roll on the featured list.

The service was very good, our server was attentive and even tried to make my lemonade from scratch even though I ordered an Iced Tea. The restaurant was modern with great colours, lamp shades and Xian Terracotta Warriors. It just seemed that the prices were high for the location and quality of food. I know for a fact that there's much better in Calgary.

One thing that I've never seen before is that they calculate the tip on your Groupon total including tip. I've included a picture. I guess it's because people have been stingy before...."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 2.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Overall experience: 3/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I normally don't visit downtown sushi restaurants because it's annoying to find parking and the prices are usually higher. However, I took advantage of a Dealfind coupon and came here with a friend. 

Koto is surprisingly large with plenty of seating - you won't be sitting elbow to elbow with the table next to you. It is a fairly 'upscale' Japanese restaurant with a beautiful contemporary Asian inspired decor. We had to take a \"later\" reservation, but when we arrived it wasn't overwhelming busy and there was plenty of seating. I guess they staggered the reservation times which allowed our food to come out fairly quick. I thought there weren't enough servers working. Once we received our food, our waitress didn't come by to see if we were okay or needed anything else during the meal. We saw that she was busy serving new arrivals.

I really enjoy the restaurant's menu which consists of items found at your typical Japanese restaurant with a few modern Koto twists like crab cakes served with wasabi tartar sauce and coconut tempura shrimp. The prices for their non-sushi items are decent: hot appetizers (~$8-$10), cold appetizers (~$12), tempura (~$8), teriyaki with soup (~$18), and sushi/sashimi combos from $19-$37. Their maki sushi rolls are around $7.50/ 6 pieces, and $9-$12.50 for their signature rolls (~8-10 pieces).

My friend and I love sashimi but we didn't bother ordering it since it was pretty expensive and we wanted to get our money's worth (from $2.50-$4.00/pieces). We decided to get the 'Spicy Salmon Roll' ($7.50/6 pieces); the 'Spicy Salmon Volcano Calamari' ($8.75/6 pieces) with albacore tuna, calamari, cucumber and volcano sauce; and the 'Koto Seared Hamachi Roll' ($12.50/8 pieces) with seared hamachi, Korean sweet and spicy sauce, imitation crab, mayo, cucumber, and avocado. 

The portion was average (just slightly bigger than a toonie), but I found some of the pieces had more rice than filling. The rice was bland which made non-sauced rolls taste \"bleh\". Koto's 'Spicy Salmon' roll doesn't come with the usual mayo/siracha sauce on top. Instead, it had a tiny chunky spicy mixture. If you want something like the above, I suggest getting anything with 'volcano sauce' on it.  

The 'Seared Hamachi' roll was good for the big piece of velvety Hamachi, but I DISLIKED the rest of it which was essentially a California roll soaked in an overly sweet teriyaki/soy sauce. If you left the roll for too long, the sauce would completely soak the rice so it fell apart when you picked it up.

I also shared the 'Beef Tataki' ($12) appetizer which I thoroughly enjoyed. The meat was lightly seared, sliced to a perfect thickness, and bathed in a tasty Japanese citrus based sauce called shichimi ponzu. Crunchy sesame infused oil and garlic chips were sprinkled on top to add a unique texture to the dish. It's definitely some of the better beef tatiki's I've had, but some might find the sauce overwhelmingly vinegary.

Getting good takoyaki in Calgary is hard to come-by, and after visiting Tokyo nothing in Calgary compares. Koto's 'Takoyaki' ($8 for 6 pieces) were small, and the insides were overly mushy, slightly greasy, and only had a tiny piece of octopus inside. 

Overall, Koto felt like any average Japanese restaurant. I neither hate nor give Koto a good recommendation to come here. There are equally better and cheaper Jap restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a bunch of people - there were 7 of us altogether.  This is a strange location, it's changed hands a few times in the last 20 years I've worked downtown.  Used to be French, then Italian, and now Sushi.  It's long on the inside so bigger than expected.  Very nicely updated to modern chic.

Food - above average for sushi.  I ordered the spicy salmon roll and the spider roll (my fave), and both were very well done.  No intestinal taste in the soft-shell crab which is always a big plus.  Spicy salmon  sauce was definitely a winner though.  Delayed burn at the bag of the throat.    
Price - higher than the average sushi restaurant, which is OK if the food is also on the same higher level.  Koto almost makes it there, but not quite.  For the quality and taste, the price was a bit high.
Parking - street pay parking.
Service - the service was pretty good.  We pre-ordered and requested separate bills for everyone.  The food came out pretty fast, but the tempura shrimp was lukewarm, so some points off for that.

Overall - it's just OK.  Food is good, but the higher pricing raises the expectation to Zen 8 or Sushi Bar Zipang quality.  Didn't quite make it.  Good luck to them."}
{"text":"It's not easy to excel as a high-volume sushi venue in downtown Calgary. As such, I do understand when prices have to be higher and corners need to be cut. So my review is made with this in mind.

The first thing you notice about Koto is it is quite large with many tables for a sushi venue. The kitchen at the back is open, yet the viewing area is quite small.  Having been here twice now, I can say there are some minor inconsistencies with the fish quality.  So I'll address that first.

The tuna sashimi and scallops were excellent on one visit, truly top notch. And mediocre to even bad on the next. This indicates to me that there may be a freshness or food count/ordering issue.  In general, the rolls are quite good though admittedly they use simply too much rice to the extent that you feel full quite quickly, and it's not from the fish.

Volcano rolls were good, though some of the other mainstream rolls were mediocre, having a non-favourable fish ingredient to non fish ingredient ratio (if that makes any sense!). When you combine this notion with the price, it seems a bit overpriced in general.  Dynamite's were a bit chintzy, my friends remarked that the california rolls had imitation crab, and the special rolls, while somewhat large, are disappointing considering the price - in both composition and quality. 

Service was \"cold\", though very prompt, with the food coming out quickly--always a good thing when you have meetings to get to in the afternoon.

In the end I would still recommend this place simply due to its location. If you've got a major craving, it will satisfy. As far as north-end downtown, it's better than Hiro in terms of quality, and about on par if not slightly worse than Sakana (and obviously much better than the food court). Atmosphere in Sakana is a little more laid back and fun, if that is important to you."}
{"text":"Wow.  Why aren't more people here.    Food is amazing and portions are huge.!  Servers were very helpful and knowledgeable   We will be back !"}
{"text":"I'm going to say.... distinctly underwhelming.  In my view, sushi's either good or it isn't. The meal was ... okay?... sort of?  To begin, there was nothing Japanese about the starter salad, which was basically a green salad with thousand island dressing and fried potatoes on top.  My health conscious lunch companion simply couldn't finish it.  The maki rolls were pretty loose, which was fine, but it all seemed a little amateurish.  For a $57 lunch, \"good enough\" is not really the standard to be striving for.  Unless otherwise constrained by time or proximity, I would likely head elsewhere rather than visit again."}
{"text":"My main question is, \"where is the owner?\" Owners typically understand their customer and cater towards them. The location of Koto puts it right downtown, next to the major hub of Sheraton/Westin hotels, which means the crowd could potentially be regular business folks looking to satisfy their sushi pangs. I'm always shocked though that most of the crowd seems to be either students, asian families or other regulars. 

In terms of price, it is definitely right for the quality of food you are getting. 

However, Koto is a maddeningly frustrating joint. The food is solid. The service is somewhat friendly, but inconsistent. The staff look somewhat happy, but not exactly like they actually want you there. When you think of what separates a solid Japanese joint from a \"just okay\" place, it's the energy that the staff can bring. Being knowledgeable, friendly, slightly off-beat and having Japanese hospitality always makes things better. 

If there was a half decent competitor in the area, I would probably be there. More likely than not, it's a sign of Calgary's knowledge and maturity for Japanese cuisine. Not sure this place would thrive in a proper market. For now. I'll be at the mercy of Koto."}
{"text":"I liked it! Great sushi, the only thing was the waitresses! They are not that friendly and are not around checking if the customers need something"}
{"text":"I would definitely say the price range is a $$$ not a $$, but anyway, on to the food.

Good: the sashimi sizes are hearty and very fresh, and the appetizers are sizable as well. The Miso is always really hot and flavorful (but not too salty), and the service is fair. Their specialty rolls are totally generously portioned and delicious, I feel like their attenion to detail is a little crappy, I'll explain why below. 

Bad: Despite having a full arsenal of sushi chefs on a quiet afternoon, they were unwilling to make no-rice rolls of any kind for my friend who is unable to digest rice properly. We've gone to lower-end restaurants who were much more accommodating of this, and it wasn't busy, so I don't know how the sushi 'chefs' couldnt simply make the plain rolls with fish, veg, avocado, etc. in the nori. We didn't cause a fuss about it she just ordered some sashimi, but that seemed pretty stupid to me. With the request she offered up front to pay extra for this as it would change their process, but come on, if I can make riceless maki at home and I'm a sushi idiot, i feel like a chef shoudln't get their pants in a twist about something like that, especially if extra charges are accepted by the patron. 

Speaking of sashimi, the shake and thake sashimi was lousy with little fish bones, very off putting, we didn't finish it. total shame, too, because the flavor was great, but I just couldnt handle picking bones out of my sushi, pretty unheard of experience for me. Ordered it before without that misfortune, but yea It was definitely bad enough that I won't order either of those again.

It's close to my office, i'll go back, but I have little interest in recommending this place to others if they live/work closer to another sushi place."}
{"text":"Walked in with a sushi craving. Left grossed out and unsatisfied. Should have turned around when they asked if I had a groupon. Red flag much if you need to sell groupons for business in the busy downtown core.

Sushi is not fresh. Do not recommend eating unless you like gambling with your raw fish. I left most of my sushi uneaten as I didn't want to take the risk. Couldn't even get miso soup right as it tasted very off."}
{"text":"The food was good and came out quickly, which is great when eating over lunch downtown.  The service was good as well.  Will try other items next time as we did their lunch plates, which were good and very filling."}
{"text":"solid 3.5 stars.  I don't know why they need to put out so many groupon-type deals when they are really pretty decent.  Sushi is reasonably priced and pretty good.  Food presentation is spectacular there too."}
{"text":"Very bad service, very bad attitude, offensive waitresses."}
{"text":"I bought a Dealfind deal for this restaurant. From reading reviews, it seemed like price was the main issue so I thought \"Heck - if I can get decent to good sushi for half the price, I'm laughing!\"

Even the initial phone call started off awkwardly, with me trying to make a reservation for 7, being told I can make a reservation \"after 5:45\" - did she mean call back after 5:45 or I can have any reservation after 5:45? Eventually, I made a reservation for 7:50.

Parking is on-street but we didn't have any issues finding a place. The decor and atmosphere is awesome - we liked the decorations and the music a lot. There's a tonne of space in this restaurant and everything was in great shape.

The food was pretty average - we ordered yam tempura, some sashimi (presentation could have been better), a mango roll, kappa and a sweet chili tofu dish. Also, miso soup (of course!) The miso was saltier than usual, but I like salt so I didn't mind it - just meant I didn't add soy sauce to it.

Speaking of soy sauce, we were served our entire meal and then we realized there wasn't any on our table. We waited about 5 minutes, server never stopped by and we ended up stealing one from the neighbouring table. Likewise, we ordered a sake and water. Water glasses = never refilled. From my vantage point, I stared right at the bar area, which, as the evening wore on, got progressively more and more full of dirty cups. It was pretty gross to watch. And, nobody took away our dishes as we finished, so the table was pretty full at the end. Took us a while to pay as well. 

All in all, for what it cost, the service and the actual product, I may only go back if a group wanted to go. I wouldn't make the effort or even get another coupon.

{"text":"Service was really bad. The short cut hair server was rude. When I ordering she just go away before finish my order even I still talking. And also food wasn't good. Fish was really fish and sushi rice had no flavor. 
When I get home my sister and I had stomachache. I think every food wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"4 stars for its DT location and decor but that's about it, so it's great for the business ppl.

As name suggests, it's more upscale and would say this is where you would discuss business or have a good time to show out of town guests.

But can't say it's authentic.  At least they don't have like 300 items lol, this one is less than 100.  Not sure if I would actually spend $22 for a AAA steak, 10 oz.

   She then looked up at me again and was like: oh..... I don't see anything....i looked around the restaurant and it was less then half full. she then said : oh it's fine! Just come with me. 

   We got sat near where the chefs were making sushi.

    The only waitress that was working super slow motion finally got to us. There was only 3 people working.

     Someone finally came to took our older,which is a older Japanese lady.

      We figured the snotty girl that's wearing a tank top is the owner or manager because she was the only one of the 3 dressed like she was ready to go clubbing.

       As we waited we watched other people's food sit longer then it should by the chefs. The waitresses walked by the food plenty of times while I watched the other customers looking around at others while waiting. 


       We were in need of some spicy mayo, so my fianc√© approached one of the sushi chefs to ask for some as our table was right next to them. He was abruptly told to sit down by the clubwear girl and that she would bring us some. Apparently I approached a god and was not allowed to speak out of turn.

       We finally got our food and it was ok. They're quality is the same as Umi Sushi at crossiron Mills. And I think some on the sushi Umi was better sadly.

      The Decor was 4/5 but I do agree with the YELPERS about their attitude and customer service in this place sucks.

       Thank you Groupon! I'm glad I didn't pay $50 for little lower then food court quality sushi!

    Happy Nomming YELPERS!"}
{"text":"this is probably one of my favourite sushi places. the service isn't always that great since there's a lot of people with groupons. most of the time the service alright, but when it's busy, the service is slightly poor. the sushi is very good. I love the volcano sauces & I'm a very picky eater but the sushi here is easy to eat. I love it!"}
{"text":"With the arrival of a business associate, and a request to do sushi, I was on the quest for a good sushi restaurant in Calgary. With hubby working in downtown Calgary and being a patron of several sushi joints, I conferred with him. 

He's told me how good Koto is before and he told me yet again. If you want good sushi, he said it's the best in Calgary. Being that Koto was pretty close to where my business associate was staying, I took the advice.

We got there on Saturday at 5pm which was quiet. The servers were attentive, very sweet and the sushi was delish.

When my guest declares it is some of the best she's had, I was pleased. 

We were stuffed and I was the lucky gal to bring home leftovers. I was going to give it to my hubby as a thank you for doling out a good recommendation, but then I thought, screw that! He can go for sushi downtown any old time. Me, not so much. 
So, I ate the hell out of the leftovers without remorse.

Next time I get to downtown Calgary and wanting sushi, another trip to Koto will be in the itinerary."}
{"text":"Service there is really bad!!... Waiters are really slow and not friendly at all!! The food took almost one hour in arrive! And the sushi was just ok... I really hope I don't have to go there again.. I went there only because it was the only option at 9pm in the area and I really regret going there..."}
{"text":"As a Calgary visitor who had been walking around the city all day, I was looking for a place to sit down and relax to enjoy some fresh sushi. The sushi options in the area is VERY limited to either fast food joints or generally low quality shops, and I found this place to be a really nice sit down option. My sushi was delicious and the service was great, but it was definitely a little pricey."}
{"text":"This is an awesome sushi place. Food is delicious and reasonably priced. Cons: sometimes the sashami comes out still frozen (:() and if you're there for lunch, be prepared to be \"forgotten\" at times. We once waited 15 minutes to have our server acknowledge us and bring us water.....but food - great!"}
{"text":"Koto is a fancier japanese sushi restaurant.  I ordered salmon sashimi, creamy scallops sushi, shared 1/2 rolls of Philadelphia roll and Spider crab roll - overall pretty good sashimi and sushi.  It is on the pricey side but the sushi was fresh and tasty.  The salmon sashimi came in huge thick cuts!  

Even my protege liked what I ordered for him!  I've converted him to a sushi eater!"}
