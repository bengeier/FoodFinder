{"text":"I really had high hopes about this place! I ordered a shredded beef burro and chips and salsa and was told it would be 25 min. I got there in 20 min. and the food must have been sitting awhile as it was cold. The burro was the driest burro I've ever had, plus extremely salty. It was actually difficult to swallow at times, so DRY!  I had read other reviews about the salsa but wanted to try it anyway. I should have known when they kept calling it a \"sauce.\" It's not like any salsa I've ever had and I didn't like it at all. They should consider other options for people who like salsa. This was very much like a spicy sauce, very spicy in fact. I will go to a Mexican restaurant for the chips and salsa, so it's disappointing there's is not good, in my opinion. I also ordered the pico which was a waste. Very dry, just tomato chunks with some jalepeno sprinkled on top.   All in all, I felt like I threw my money down the drain."}
{"text":"4 stars???  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here.    The lovely people at Dean's Hermanos seem very nice.  The service was very friendly.  I don't think they are bad people.  This, however, is not good Mexican food.  The edges of Gilbert, heading into the QC area are sorely lacking in excellent food options (Mexican especially), so we were excited when Dean's opened up.  The food was not inedible.  It didn't seem like bad quality ingredients.  It's just that none of it was cooked especially well, nor was it particularly flavorful.  Simple, cheap, authentic Mexican food should be so easy.  We started with a cheese crisp, and we asked for \"extra crisp\" because we like it crunchy, almost burnt.  What we got was more of a cheese soggy bottom.  There was cheese, but certainly no crisp.  Again, not inedible, just not enjoyable.  The chimichanga (my order) and the enchiladas (wife's) were equally uninspiring.  The red enchilada sauce was so plain - almost like canned tomato sauce.  Not really full of flavor.  Plenty of iceberg lettuce, though, so if that's your bag, maybe this is your place.  If you think tomato sauce and black pepper are \"spicy\" and \"ethnic\" then maybe Dean's is right up your alley.  For us, we'll keep dreaming of a day when a better option becomes available in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"UPDATE-We decided to give Dean's another try and have now been back several times. They were clearly going through growing pains and have done a good job working them out. We have been in several more times and have been met with quick, friendly service and the food was great!  I rescind my previous review and recommend Dean's!!!  ********  Stopped in for dinner on a Thursday evening. The restaurant was only half full. It took almost 10 minutes to be seated. We sat for another 15 min before they took our order.....again, the restaurant was just half full, three servers and very SLOW, inattentive service. Chip bowl and drinks sat empty while the servers chatted with the cook at the window. Very disappointing service.  It was clear they were giving priority to the drive-thru and take-out customers. Good thing SomeBurros is coming to Queen Creek soon. We won't be back here."}
{"text":"The food was very good and we had it delivered through door dash my husband who LOVES Mexican food loved it, I imagine it's even better fresh!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food and the service was awesome!  Ordered the Fundito platter and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Shredded beef tacos and their hot sauce are addicting!! Usually very fast service but even on the weekends when there is a wait it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Mexican food! Amazing beans and rice, tacos and enchiladas.  The service is great - fast and friendly.  Hot sauce and salsa is also very good.  Very large portions."}
{"text":"Local owned casual Mexican food restaurant. Good food.  Decent prices.  Attentive staff.  Food came out quick.  Chips and salsa to start.  Liked the salsa.  Not my favorite chips.  Had combo #6: beef taco,  cheese enchilada, bean tostado, rice and beans.   A lot of food.  Wish there was a 2 taco combo on the menu. Really liked the taco and the enchilada sauce.  Also enjoyed my wife's corn tamale.  Guacamole was good and fresh.  They did a lot of take out orders while we were there.  Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Not really genuine Mexican food, blah, weak service and expensive. Gilbert restaurants aren't very good and this one is even below that low bar. I live around the corner and won't bother with this place."}
{"text":"The hot and mild salsa were great for starters! Walked in and was greeted right away! The shrimp tacos and enchiladas were what my mom and I ate and they were by far the best I've had in awhile! My dad had a beef burro that was good as well, but the shrimp is what you want to get! GREAT service and friendly servers and cooks! Clean place and will be back often!"}
{"text":"Such a great place.  The food is fantastic.  I have been there several times and tried various item and they have all been great.  Everyone there is very friendly and the service if excellent."}
{"text":"Really small, flavorless, overpriced burritos. We were very disappointed with this place. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!! I love the easy atmosphere and basic menu that is all delicious.  I've been waiting 12 years with your Mexican food in Queen Creek South East Gilbert area.  The prices are reasonable too.  Looking forward to many more visits here."}
{"text":"We checked the reviews before heading over, and were prepared for whatever came our way. It seems that the service problems the previous folks experienced may have been early-season fumbles. Our servers seemed to have low experience, but high awareness and concern, and made the dinner quite a joy.  As others commented, the food was quite good, standard tasty Mexican fare. I would love to see them give their food a little twist to make it a truly exceptional experience. As it is, it's certainly one of the best Mexican choices in Gilbert. With a little time and continued improvement, it could be one of the best Mexican places in the east valley."}
{"text":"A good change from previous owners. Lunch was underwhelming. Service was okay but not attentive. Food was good but not worth the price. Probably not go back."}
{"text":"In one word: MEDIOCRE. I ordered Steak Fajitas and Combo #1 to go and arrived on time but still waited about 15 minutes until my order was ready. The hostess was nice, she apologized and offered me a 10% off coupon. The food cost $25 for 2 dishes, the portions were big but bland. They seemed to substitute fat for flavor, my taco shell was fried and the beans seemed to have alot of lard in them. The salsa they provided tasted like tomato sauce with no flavor, the tortilla chips no salt. I am conflicted because I can see why they have some good reviews based on customer service, cleanliness and portion size. However, the food costs too much for the quality and the amount of Mexican food competition nearby."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this great little place.  The soft tacos are delicious (beef and chicken).  The Fundito plate is amazing.  But the Deans Chimichanga is to die for!!!!   Ask for the Chunky salsa when they bring chips to your table!   It tops everything Off perfectly!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at this nice restaurant.  I had the fish tacos they were great servings are very nicely sized and the meal I ordered came with a side of beans and rice it was great.  My husband got the shrimp enchiladas and they were great but they were super spicy but still good if you love the heat.  I will definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"I stopped in thinking it was a fast food type Mexican food place and I was planning on getting something quick to go. First thing I noticed when I walked in was the place was a really nice restaurant! I totally plan on taking my parents in when they get here for Christmas..it's that good! I ordered the Fundido plate with chicken. It was the bomb! Jalape√±o cream cheese was excellent too! My son ordered the taquito plate, loved it and so did I. The salsa, chips also passed the test. I will definitely go back. Prices were also very reasonable especially for what you get in portions and taste. Lance"}
{"text":"Well I guess I will never find what I left in California. So sick of these claim to be authentic Mexican food places serving this crap and over charging. It's Taco Tuesday and I went and got 3 beef tacos and a chicken burrito which I had to ask them to add beans and cheese and my total was $22 and some change. I love Senor Taco and I should of when to them but I made the mistake and gave this place a chance. So disappointed and I will never go back and never recommend it. Damn near $4 Taco has about .50 cents of meat in it. The cheese was the best part of the meal. Burrito was bland and I had to bath it in salsa which didn't have any flavor. I'm so disappointed for those prices this stuff should have been amazing."}
{"text":"We had a hankering for Mexican and we're excited to try Dean's based on the reviews.  Upon looking at the menu, our initial feelings were the food sounded good but seemed kind of expensive.  We placed a pick up order anyway and got 2 enchiladas, 2 tacos, a kids meal, and 2 orders of beans and rice ($32).  Everything was a-la-carte.  The order was prepared quickly (less than 20 minutes) and I received a friendly greeting upon entering the restaurant.  Fast forward to the food.  The machaca was mostly onions and peppers and very little meat.  Plus, they were very stingy with how much they put on everyone's meals.  The tacos were mostly cheese and lettuce (there was a tiny stripe of so-called meat hidden).  The kids meal tacos are soft corn shells (which we didn't know) and my son didn't like them.  The enchiladas were just okay and overpriced.  The salsa is bland and tastes like spicy tomato paste (we resorted to using jarred salsa instead).  Overall, not very impressed.  I think we're going to look elsewhere for our Mexican fix in the future."}
{"text":"Great food and terrific service.  Bottomless drinks, endless chips and salsa, perfect rice and beans. Our new favourite Mexican."}
{"text":"Order tacos and returned them because they fries them. Owner (Dean) demanded that wife pays for half of the new ones that were not fried when she drove 10 minutes back to the restaurant to return them. He was very loud with her with their customers in the restaurant and laughed at her loudly when she walked out in disbelief that an owner of a company like this would try to charge again for the mistake. Disrespectful and not someone you want to support in the community. I love so many restaurants here in QC/Gilbert and love making good reviews for good service. This one blew me away. Will never go back and will never support this company."}
{"text":"So happy to have a great Mexican food restaurant close. We have had so many great things but one of our favorites is the chicken fundido."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing!!!  We had enchiladas, tacos, and loaded nachos with jalapeno cream cheese and all the toppings.   SO YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"2 words: chicken taco seriously the best chicken taco I think I've ever had! It has this jalape√±o cream cheese filling in it and my mouth is watering just thinking about this  The only thing I have to say is the salsa is two . If you're a Mexican restaurant, I feel like you should have a decent salsa- but I'm with everyone else's reviews on their salsa- it's not good and tastes like ketchup. I would suggest coming up with a 2nd salsa and give the customers their choice of which salsa they want. And I also wish the drive through was open more hours(but I understand that they are small and don't have the staff for that) but all n' all- good food!"}
{"text":"This family-owned restaurant is an amazing and friendly dining experience. I will be upfront and honest that I know most of the people associated with the restaurant and the owner is a dear friend and mentor. With that upfront, here are my thoughts:  The restaurant is very clean and nice for a quiet lunch or dinner; whether dining with family or alone. The hostess is generally the owner's wife, and she is the loveliest lady on the planet. If you ever had a concern, she would openly hear your concern and do everything to accommodate. If it isn't her, it is probably Shaylene, who also takes pride in delivering the best and friendliest service possible.  Being a friend, I always get a hug when I visit, but I've never seen anything but friendliness and smiles as they greet everyone who comes in, and when Dean is there, he is often stopping by each table to greet and hear your thoughts and feedback. They take pride in the establishment, but also believe in growth and improvement.  The food is great! I've never ordered anything I didn't love, but also ask what is on the dishes, in case you don't like veggies or something specific. The Botana Chips and Dean's Chimi are my personal favorites, but for me, it is a blast to see my friends and enjoy the experience of eating at Dean's.   The best part about this experience is that I'm not the only one. The owner and his family are very involved in the restaurant and you would get to know them quick. The experience I have and enjoyment from visiting friends and enjoying great Mexican food is something any guest can enjoy! Highly recommend you start enjoying your own experience at Dean's! 8/10"}
{"text":"The service was good, the server was pleasant. The restaurant decor was nice, they did a good job converting it from the former fast food business. They had country music playing which probably should've been a sign the food would be more American version of Mexican than real. Mexican.   Unfortunately, to us, the food was bland, the meat was a little tough. The salsa was very tomato pasty. My husband liked the spicy bean dip, but I found it to be just average...neither of us thought it was spicy, mostly just cream cheese with refried beans. Probably a good spot for people who don't like spice."}
{"text":"Overpriced, flavorless food  First of all I saw 1 taco for four dollars and I thought this must be a really good taco because other than that I don't know how you justify four dollars for one taco.  I got 2 beef tacos and two chicken tacos and my total ended up being $16 and change.   When I bit into the taco The shell was greasy and the taco consisted of bland meat, lettuce, and tomato.   This was nowhere near a gourmet taco. If I wanted cheap barely edible greasy tacos I go to Jack-in-the-Box.   It says authentic Mexican food and I guess in some ways the right because I'm paying premium prices to eat like a poor person.   Finally I found the salsa and poured it on to the taco and to my surprise the salsa tasted like marinara sauce.   I didn't know marinara sauce was Mexican I could've sworn it was Italian anyway don't eat here it sucks and it's overpriced."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings. Although we liked most the food we had, I was missing a taco. I had shrimp tacos, or 1 taco. It was very good. Fiance had a beef chimichanga and said It was good as well. I also ordered sopapillas, wouldn't get them again. I've made them since I was young and they weren't at all what I prefer. I am going to try again though because of the shrimp taco I had. It was pretty delicious, let's hope the next time I get the 2 I paid for."}
{"text":"Their nachos are unreal! Their meats are yummy, good flavor but not tons of fat. If you like Mexican food check this little taco shop out."}
{"text":"Wow the best fish tacos eva!! Everything was so clean and the service was fast and friendly! We will be back. The food was all delicious!!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Ordered a chicken burrito with rice and beans inside. $8 later the chicken is bland boiled shredded chicken. Only flavor was from the beans."}
{"text":"This is our \"go to\" Mexican food restaurant! Love the cheese enchiladas, Dean's chimi, Carne asada.. It's all so good!"}
{"text":"Got a burrito for 9 bucks and it is smaller than too bells. Definitely not worth the money!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place.  The beef tacos, beans, chips . I can't get enough, I probably go 2-3 times a week possibly more.  It's always great service, they made an error once and fixed it so quickly, I just love them.  I also really love the decor inside, very well done!  This is my favorite taco place, blows Los Favs out of the water!"}
{"text":"I'm a Mexican food snob and this place did not disappoint. Atmosphere was great, staff was friendly and prompt. I really enjoyed the taco enchilada combo. The enchilada sauce was the best I've had and I loved the taco! Will be back often!"}
{"text":"I had two chili rellenos- chicken and machaca- and they were tasty! The customer service was great and they are all very friendly. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I had a taco salad, lots of lettuce,  not much meat. Had cheese all melted with it on top. It was the worst ever. It was a big mess with the cheese melted into q big blob. I wasted my 10$.  The chips on side were stale."}
{"text":"I went to Dean's with a lunch date, but this review is for my meal alone, as she did not care for her's as much as I liked my lunch order.  I ordered the Carne Asada Chimi and it was Quite Good.  The steak was tender and fresh.  The tortilla had just the right amount of crispness to hold up to the Enchilada Style finish I added to it.  The Guacamole was good and so was the salsa.  The owner came by and introduced himself and was quite pleasant to speak with.  In-fact, everyone that works there was very pleasant and had smiles on their faces.  Refills kept coming and were needed as we ordered the extra spicy habanero hot sauce.  The interior is modern and clean, but not pretentious at all.  Great little clean Mom & Pop Mexican restaurant.  Support M&P's, go in and give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great. My wife would eat here everyday if I let her. Friendly staff. Food is served fresh and hot. Nice to have a great Mexican Restaurant in the Gilbert/Queen Creek area. I have been eating Mexican food in the valley for 65 years so I should know what I am talking about!! Give this place try and you will become a regular."}
{"text":"Second visit. Got a kids cheese quesadilla and it's just one slice of square processed cheese on a tortilla. Terrible. Tacos were great first visit, second time they were less than mediocre. Also, overpriced"}
{"text":"This is now a regular stop for me. Huge portions of carefully prepared food served by personable and engaging team."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be back. Flavor less and over priced..not to mention waiting 15 minutes in a darken alley drive thru. Not sure the long wait we were the only customers. Should of went to taco bell not worth $30 to feed two adults and a toddler."}
{"text":"Stopped by this new restaurant last week to pick up a menu and place a take out order - had to wait 45 minutes for my order.  Menu states you call ahead for take-out or order online - but on my 2nd attempt to call ahead - after calling for 20 minutes with no one ever answering phone, I then tried to place an order on website - but it does not even provide a way to place an order....so - I drove there again to place my take-out order (and would of been willing to wait or even come back to pick up) I was treated so rudely and no one would even take my order with me standing right there waiting - stating they were 'extremely busy' ...but over 1/2 of the restaurant was empty and there were 4 servers for 5 occupied tables.  Would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 beef tacos.... so awful the shredded beef had no flavor. Lettuce had some brown old pieces. They offer you if you want the spicy salsa or the chunky. I like spice so I choose The spicy it's was very sweet. With so many Mexican restaurants out of here there hey need to step up their game. Not anything close to authentic."}
{"text":"Great food! First time going here.  Wonderful service! Have to mention was so nice to see the owners interacting with the employees and treating them with such respect! Way to go! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada burrito how I like it.. Meat, Beans, Lettuce, tomato and Sour cream. It was a good burrito, better than most in the area..  So why the 3 stars? The price.. My steak burrito was almost $12.."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food! Not only is the staff VERY friendly, but the food came out fast! This restaurant will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Total deliciousness!!  I have to eat here at least once a week! Great food, AWESOME owners and staff!  Always friendly and they aim to please!  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Where's the rice that's supposed to come with the combination meals? Menu is deceiving. The Chimichangas reminded me of the old-school Hot Pockets... Grease was dripping profusely from the tacos. Shaking my head... Been there, done that and I'm done."}
{"text":"Cozy place with great Mexican food. Chips were warm and we ordered the street tacos. Chicken and beef, loved the taste and not spicy which is perfect for me. The machaca is spicy so if you are in for that you can get those or always add in the chili sauce."}
{"text":"The food was great and the people were very friendly. It was fast service. I had tacos and the steak was really good! The only things I would say I wish were different were the salsa and the alcohol factor. The salsa tastes like a tomato paste that was watered down. They do not serve alcohol because they do not have a liquor license, which kind of dampened my mood because I really had a taste for a margarita and that is one of my favorite combos. Mexican food and margaritas hello! Otherwise, it's a great little place."}
{"text":"New! This place has the BEST chicken stuffed Chili Rellenos!!! It is a sweet little \"Mom & Pop\" place, and will exceed your expectations. It will surely become a favorite!"}
{"text":"Green Chili burro... Yummy! Service was just as awesome as the food! We will be BACK!"}
{"text":"This place is quaint, has an extremely attentive staff, and is family owned and operated.  We have lived in the area for a year and had yet to stop in.  Tonight we were looking for something casual so we had read the reviews and tried it.  We were not disappointed.  We were greeted by owner Michelle, and waited on by daughter Lauren, both were great and spent the time to educate us on the menu and back story of the restaurant.  We ordered the Chicken Taco Salad and Chicken Fundido, both were terrific and more than enough food.  The \"hot\" salsa was a pleasant surprise, is was hot, but very flavorful.  We loved our first experience here and will be back, so happy to support local and be so close to us."}
{"text":"Walked in expecting something completely different, but this place is super cute! There is a drive through and they do online order so it is also convenient. Inside it is full of very nice decorations, nice place for a sit down meal, and jut a happy feeling here. The salsa was very spicy but had a great flavor. I loved my meal! It was extremely hot, like boiling on my plate still, but it was worth burning my mouth for!"}
{"text":"Very good! We really enjoyed the Dean's Chimi with machaca! Rice and beans are great and they have flake ice! Service was friendly and we never wanted for chips, salsa or drink refills. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, the shredded chicken is marinated and delicious, I keep going back,  I just hate the hours."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile. It was fantastic. Best Green Chili (beef) I've ever had. Enchilada also a killer. Had it last night and been craving it all day."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great Globe/thatcher Mexican style food, this is a great place! First time here and was not disappointed. I had a sample platter and had plenty to share.  The chips were probably the only thing that I felt were not as great as I was expecting but the tamale made up for it for sure."}
{"text":"Very good food, great service, kind and caring owners- must try. Enjoyed their mild salsa, spicy bean dip, taco (shredded beef!), and fundido. Everything tasted fresh and not greasy. The fajitas looked and smelled great."}
{"text":"The food by far was sub par and had no taste. The beef taco was horrible and the tamale was beyond dry. The entire plate was covered with melted cheese and some unknown sauce. The only reason I even gave it 1 Star was the service."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! We can't get enough of the tacos, enchiladas, bean tostadas and of course chips and hot sauce!"}
{"text":"This is an average little Mexican food spot. I came in for lunch on a weekday. I was seated and delivered a cute little bowl of chips, with a pitcher of salsa. The chips and salsa were good, nothing amazing. It's a smooth (blended) mild salsa, there appears to only be one choice.  The menu is sparse, it has the typical Mexican entrees and not much else. I asked the waitress for a recommendation and she suggested \"any of these\" graduating toward the entire entree section... I wound up ordering the \"Dean's Chimi\" with a side of jalapeno cream cheese.  The food arrived quickly and the serving was pretty huge. The jalapeno cream cheese was very good on the chips, or mixed with the beans and rice. The Chimi itself was a little letdown, it's soaked in enchilada sauce, which makes it soggy from the first bite, sort of ruining the point of a fried shell.   The bill arrived and it was nearly $25 with tip. This is about twice what you'd expect for lunch in an average restaurant around here.  All in all the meal was good, but not exceptional. I don't think I'll be coming back because it's pretty dramatically overpriced for what you receive."}
{"text":"First time for me for this new restaurant and the food, service and ambiance are all excellent. A very good menu selection and very comfortable setting. I had the Carne Asada Street Tacos and was very happy with my choice. It is a distance from where I live but worth it. If you are ever in the neighborhood of Queen Creek Road and Higley then this is the place to satisfy your craving for Mexican food though never on Sunday and bring cash."}
{"text":"I was craving tacos and decided to try this place on our way home from little league. To my surprise, they are officially the best chicken tacos I have ever had. Another bonus is they have a drive through. You really can't get any better than this place. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Love their carne asada, rice, beans and mild salsa. Yum! Shredded beef tacos and delicious too. So glad to have them near our home."}
{"text":"Well another place that does not seem to know what to do with someone dining alone. I came in and waited behind someone who was getting takeout. No one acknowledged me until a couple came in after me. The owner then came over to greet them and noticed me. Then he asked me how many.   Service continued to disappoint. The waitress seemed to be covering all the tables. She took the couple's order who came in after me before mine. I had my menu shut and looked ready to order, yet they were taken care of first.   The food was better than the service. I had a shrimp taco and the blueberry dessert chimi to go.   I really wanted to like this place but I often dine alone. It turned me off. Perhaps I will just order to go, but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"The service is fast and friendly, not an obnoxiously large menu, but something for everyone. The street tacos are delicious, Deans Chimi wonderful, the beans and rice are more flavorful than any I've had prior. The salsa was my favorite, you better like spicy. I cannot give enough praise for the staff, the owner was onsite and visited every table, such a positive experience."}
{"text":"What a disappointment this place is, ordered combos and they came with no rice despite what their menu states - the food is dry and blah! Very greasy tacos and chimis aren't any better than a hot pocket.   Wont be back"}
{"text":"We love Deans! This place is our go to Mexican food place. Everything is awesome! They have the best ice and bubbly soda, the chips are always hot and fresh, the food always comes out perfect. Tacos, tamales, enchiladas... you can't go wrong! Try the Deans chimi too, and bring your appetite because the portions are huge and there will be leftovers! Our favorite place!"}
{"text":"Awesome service!! If you love great Mexican this is the place to go! Great family style and fast!!"}
