{"text":"VEGETARIANS take note...are you sick of bland steamed vegetables and fried rice? So were we. Based on the Yelp reviews for Sizzling Hut we decided to give it a try. And wow, what a win! We were the only diners in the dining room so we asked the server/owner which dishes were vegetarian. Since we mentioned that we like spicy food she recommended the vegetable moo shu (4 heat stars) and the mixed vegetables and tofu with Szechuan sauce, which is not actually on the menu and was totally worth the dollar up charge.  As if the service couldn't be better, the server then proceeded to roll our moo shu for us. She couldn't have been more friendly or attentive.   Apologies for the lack of photos but we were so caught up in the experience that we neglected to take any.   In short, make the trek to this hidden gem in DeForest! Even though there aren't many Yelp reviews, Sizzling Hut has been in business for 14 years. Let's keep it going!!"}
{"text":"Unassuming from outside, but friendly service and delicious Chinese food on the inside...and we are not easily impressed!  Good vegi options too.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!! Great local business that has been around for over ten years! Sheri and Micheal are the owner's, they are great people. Very friendly and love doing what they do! Fantastic food at great prices! Try the Chicken on a stick, teriyaki chicken w/ noodles, pot stickers and general tso chicken"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town! They have the best Hot and Sour soup!! Really good food and I'm never disappointed! If you're craving Chinese food, this place will surely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Cheese ragoons are top notch, even better than the crab ragoons.  Recommend the beef lo mein & shrimp fried rice.  Best Asian food in Deforest!"}
{"text":"I love this place The owners are always working and are so friendly, the food never gives me an upset tummy or makes me feel bloated like other places, portions are large I can make a couple meals out of one of there's  I just with the sweet and sour chicken had a different more traditional breeding   Side note you can order online which is super convenient , when ordering on line there's coupons you can use too."}
{"text":"I have been to Sizzling Hut twice now, both times for take-out lunch.   I wish I could offer them a 4th star, because the food is actually very good. Couple the good food with the crazy-reasonable De Forest prices, and this place adds up to a real value.   But the decor. Yeah, about that. It's pretty horrible. There's the empty, dimly-lit dining room. There's the baffling, catacomb-like trip past the bathrooms on your way to the order counter. Flat screen at the counter is playing colorized, 50's-era Doris Day movies, closed-captioned. Empty beer bottles decorate the shelves, not so much as an attempt to show you what beers they serve, but because they really, really just needed something to put there.   This is like a trip to Pyongyang, but with a much greater quantity of (I presume) better-quality food.   On a positive note, the food is really good. The Sesame Chicken is battered and deep fried, and topped with a tangy, dark brown sauce. Hot and Sour Soup is very flavorful, but lacks the thickness of many other Chinese places' soups. The fried rice served with the meals is bland, and is made with large-grain brown rice. Everything I've sampled here is very similar to what you've experienced elsewhere, but still just a little bit different. Sort of like a trip to Canada."}
{"text":"This is the first restaurant I've ever made an effort to review. We stopped here on our way back home from Canada. Saw the good reviews on yelp and decided to stop in. We are very picky with our Chinese food as we have grown up with Chinese friends and their moms cooking for us. This food was some of the best Szechuan style Chinese we've ever had. We especially enjoyed the Mushu pork and the soups (we got egg drop and hot and sour). Definitely would stop on our way back again."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  For vegetarians and for those who like spicy food, ask for the traditional Schezuan vegetable and tofu dish. Amazing flavor.  Enjoyed everything we ordered. Generous portions and very courteous service Negatives: in an empty restaurant, with just one other family, we were kept waiting for a long before someone came to our table. I guess takeout orders take precedence."}
{"text":"Best Chinese place in the Madison and suburbs area. Service was also great. We were able to order online for pick up. Wife went in to pick it up and said she spoke with a woman who could possibly be the owner. The woman was very sweet and helpful. Food was delicious, way better than the standard fare of other Chinese places. I don't know if it was the meat, or a combination of all the ingredients but the quality and the taste was just outstanding."}
{"text":"The best crab Rangoon, light and flaky. Delicious General tsos shrimp! Highly recommend even if it's a little out of the way!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant no stars, I would.   First, the restaurant was empty except for my husband and I. We were told to seat ourselves and found at least 3 dirty tables that needed to be bused yet in looking for a place to sit.   The service was also lacking. The hostess/waitress had a horrible body odor and couldn't speak to anything about the food or menu.   The water I ordered tasted gross and like I was from old rusty pipes. I had one sip and was done.   Appetizers: Cheese Rangoon's - okay, but sauce was not good.  Pork Eggrolls - Good. Nothing special.  Fried Wontons - my husband liked them.   Soups: Hot and Sour - waitress said it did not have tofu in it when in fact it did. Also tasted disgusting.  Wonton Soup - lacked any kind of flavor.   Dinner: First waitress couldn't recommend which of 3 entrees was most popular or \"better\".  Also couldn't tell me what vegetables were in the Hunan chicken and when asked wouldn't go find out either. She stuck her fingers inside the food dishes she was serving (eww), and we had to take the soups off her tray for her.   Kung Pao Chicken - first order was wrong. Then when it was brought back, it did not taste good.  Hunan Chicken - again not as ordered. Flavorless.   We brought this up to the hostess/waitress who then asked so you want me to take off... instead of sincerely caring about our experience and food.   We will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Classic American-Chinese fare. We lived in the DeForest area for more than a dozen years, so Sizzling Hut is the hometown Chinese restaurant we measure all others by.  The owner is friendly and the menu offers a lot of variety.  Our favorites include standards like hot & sour soup, sesame chicken, Governor's chicken, and potstickers -- but you really can't go wrong.  Whenever we're in the Madison area, we go out of our way to have a meal here."}
{"text":"So delicious! I will be back all the time! We got the shrimp moo shu and general tso's chicken. There was actually more chicken than batter on the general tso's, which is unheard of, and it was good chicken (not questionable parts like some Chinese restaurants). The moo shu was also fantastic. Fresh and the pancake things seemed homemade as well. Highly recommend, and I can't wait to see what else they have to offer. The only thing we didn't love was the crab rangoons. They were fine, but just couldn't compare to the rest of the food. Also got the Szechuan tofu with vegetables. Not bad, but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Do not order take out from here. First time, about a year ago, I waited 30 minutes in the restaurant  - after ordering online and driving there - for our food. It was ridiculous and I vowed not to go back. Fast forward one year, tonight was worse. This time waiting over an HOUR at the restaurant. Very unprofessional. Food is ok."}
{"text":"Who knew this place existed in Deforest?  If I had I would have tried it much sooner.  We started with Crab Rangoon which was delicious!  We ordered Mongolian Beef and General Tso's chicken and both of them were very tasty.  The vegetables were very fresh.  We were there for a dinner on a Monday night and the restaurant itself was slow for dining in - but the phone for take out was ringing off the hook.  The ambiance of the restaurant is pretty bland and so-so and the service was a little off, but only because the woman running the place was also answering the phone non-stop.  The good food made up for it.  Definitely worth a try if you like Chinese food and don't mind a little lack of character and ambiance for some good eats."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Chinese food we've found since moving to WIsconsin from the California Bay Area. It is also better than a lot of places in California."}
{"text":"Amazing food here! I drove 10hrs from Kentucky and happened to stop by for some Chinese. They have super friendly staff and very authentic Chinese food :-))  I'm glad to have stopped for dinner. I'll definitely go back on the way home!"}
{"text":"Great little place. Going through Wisconsin and wanted something other than burgers at most of the FWY exits.  The food was full of flavor and the prices were unbelievable.  Our server which I think was the owner was very good. If I lived here I would frequent quiet often."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in DeForest hands down! Teriyaki Chicken, General Tso's, Chicken on a stick, Egg rolls, Orange Chicken are some faves. Owners are super too!  Sheri always has a smile on her face and loves her customers!"}
{"text":"We love you Sherry. We always get awesome hot food quickly! The lunch special can't be beat!"}
