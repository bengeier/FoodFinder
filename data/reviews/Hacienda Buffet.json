{"text":"How can you only charge $6.95 for lunch buffet that includes two drinks? Unbeatable. 

Came here before visiting Hoover Dam. Now the food isn't excellent or anything but it will fill you up. They have a good salad bar as well as fried chicken, mashed potatoes, spaghetti, and a desert bar. Service is friendly too!"}
{"text":"Tried to order a simple lunch to cater a group offsite. They said 'no'. WTF? Trays with food 'to go' We'd pay whatever it costs/price was no object. Not very 'hospitable' for the hospitality trade."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening and 2 AYCE seafood buffet for $15 (We used the Casino Guide BOGO. Seafood buffet price for one is 10.95). Buffet comes with soda! 

- No cell phone reception. I have ATT and my GF has TMobile and neither of us had reception. Haha. Not being too far from Lake Mead and Hoover Dam, I'd think there would be, but this is besides the point! On with the food. 
- The buffet is an exceptional deal for what it's worth. Comparing other buffets in its category, Hometown Buffet, It's great.
- Seafood options include mussels, clams, polluck, fried fish, popcorn shrimp, cocktail shrimp, and stuff crab.
- Their roast beef was pretty dry, but you can put some gravy to give it a bit of flavor. 
- A must try is their chicken with artichoke and mushrooms. Possibly the best item in the buffet.
- Solid side mash potatoes and rice. Can't go wrong that
- I usually get soup at buffets, but didn't want to try the chicken noodle since it has a nice thick film on the top of the soup when I stirred with the spoon. Haha. 
- Their salad seemed fresh. I got some side mushrooms and olives. 
- The mussels and clams reminded of the quality at a Chinese buffet. The mussels were a bit tough and there were a lot of small broken shells when i bit into the clams. 
-Not quite a place where I would stuff my tummy and barf later. This is a good place to eat cheap when you are in the mood for a little bit of seafood variety at a sub-par taste. 
- Soft serve ice cream and cut pies. A ok. 
- Friendly service. 
- An average buffet that fits the average dive casino."}
