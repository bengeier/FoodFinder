{"text":"Awfull, cold seemed re heated. Terrible dinner. Fish and chips were horrible. The tartar sauce was florescent green. Complete dive."}
{"text":"There used to be 2 \"Galaxy\" breakfast joints in Richmond Hill.  Unfortunately most locals, or maybe just my peers, knew of the Yonge/Elgin Mills location. Truth be told this Richmond Heights location I'm yelping is the OG provider of the greasy spoon. Not surprised that the Elgin Mills location closed down.   I religiously order: \"Sausage and 3 eggs, over hard, home fries well done, whole wheat toast and T\". This is one of the most comforting meals in my arsenal of culinary weapons. There are many weekend mornings that my buddy Bender and I hit this cozy Richmond Hill landmark for a solid as folk breakfast. I highly recommend hitting Galaxy if you are fiending a proper greasy spoon, dudes in the kitchen no what's going down.   Bang-on.  4.2/5"}
{"text":"If you like nostalgia, this is the real thing.  Unlike Wimpy's with its 1950's decorating, Galaxy is naturally from the 50's, right down to the red vinyl booths, and aging wall coverings.  I'm pretty sure a reno hasn't occurred in over 30 years.    But how is the food?  I had breakfast, a classic over easy with a thick slice of ham, toast, home fries and coffee for $7. Galaxy goes on my \"yes\" list for breakfast joints if I don't need Eggs Benny with real hollandaise.  Which is often..."}
{"text":"This is a little diner tucked away in Richmond Hill in a plaza. It is very dated and in need of a face lift, also it always has a old icky smell too...  Its your average greasy spoon type of place, but is in need of a Reno and new menu's!   The menu's are old, fraying apart, have a dirty feel to them and the best part, the prices have all been changed and replaced with stick-on prices. I find that to be ultra tacky and cheap! especially when you can still see the old price underneath the stick and see just how much they have raised the price, its kind of shocking!  I assume this has been done because it is now under new management, so far I am very disappointed with the change over, the first thing they decide to do is sky rocket the prices, that's bad taste if you ask me, it might just push away all the regulars..  So for now I will stick to the club house because I do enjoy it and see what may become of this place, for that I give them one extra star otherwise it would be a one or below.   Very disappointed in this change :("}
{"text":"This used to be my go to spot for breakfast, brunch, or lunch in Richmond Hill. Since the new owners took over I have not returned, the service is horrible now, food is no good (not fresh or clean), and the portion sizes have gone down. Sad to say, but I will not be going back...ever."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  I was surprised.. the decor was dated and quirky.. the waitress was great."}
{"text":"Your typical breakfast joint. I didn't sit in and dine because I was in a rush, but from what I could see the decor was pretty bad and the restaurant had a funny smell to it.   The typical breakfast was definitely what you expected from a grease spoon, but was not a fan of the home fries. The potatoes were undercooked and underflavoured."}
