{"text":"This place just open around 1 month ago, is consider a new Chinese cuisine. Was decided to try this out. Came here during dinner time around 7pm, there were already a lot of people eating since it was a public holiday. Lucky we had seats right on. My first impression was that the cuisine is trying to be in top notch settings, however i don't consider it is. The staff was also kind of nice which let me cancel a dish that I no longer want it and let me reorder a new dish, not all Chinese cuisine does that. We order sweat and sour pork, angus beef tenderloin fried with Maggie sauce and stir fried jumbo shrimp with thousand island sauce. The angus beef taste pretty good, it does marinated well in it and I do recommended. The sweat and sour pork was ok by which did not impress me that much. The worst was the stir fried thousand island shrimp, it was not fully cooked and it taste kind of raw with smelly sea salt. I was very unsatisfied with that shrimp dish and also was the pricy too. At the end it comes with desserts which was mini pastry and sweet red bean soup. To note the manager might ask you to buy a vip card with 10% discount for every visit for lunch and dinner which cost $15CAD for one year and will give you a $15CAD coupon for the next visit.  Since one of the dish that we ordered was not cooked well, I was very somewhat unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This new reincarnation of Ginger and Onion is trying to elevate its offerings (as well as prices).  Weekday early bird dim sum is $3.00 per dish (S/M/L) from opening till 10:58 am.  Tea is $1.20 per person.  No more pushcarts.  Layout of order form is a bit similar to other newish dim sum restos.  Service is pleasant.  A free Chinese newspaper is offered as soon as you sit down.  Food portions are generous. Taste is average though.  While I am giving this experience 3 stars, I still prefer the value proposition of the old Ginger and Onion in Market Village"}
{"text":"This restaurant was formerly at Kennedy and Denison. The English name sounds almost the same as it was. I came with my family and we have a company of three. We ordered the food shortly after we had settled down. We ordered sweet and sour chicken, beef briskets with turnip, pan fried celery with filet and    . But we have waited for more than 30 minutes and the food have not arrived yet. Not even one dish.  The first dish, sweet and sour chicken, finally came 45 minutes after we ordered. The chicken does taste crispy and delicious. It also comes with pineapples slices, sweet ginger slices and some blueberries. Although the dishes took a long time to come, this dish does score high, 4/5. 1 point is taken away because the chicken pieces look thin!and dry.  Pan Fried Veggies with Garlic arrived shortly after the first dish. I am amazed at the cooking wine and the garlic flavour that I could taste from the veggies - score 5/5  The highlight of the dinner is the beef briskets wrapped in lotus leaves. This dish is 5/5. When the waitress cut open the leaves, the sauce overflew. Other than beef briskets, there ware chestnuts and yuba. The beef briskets taste awesome in the sauce with chestnuts and yuba. This diah is perfect!! Every ingredient blends so well with each other and every taste is bravo!   The last but not least, the pan fried celery with filet came. The veggies on the side are good, the filet however tastes a bit funny. To be frank, I don't like this dish - score 3/5.  The service is good and the restaurant looks classy.  It is good for family dinner"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since January and it's a decent Dim Sum restaurant, great service and food.  Reason why I've put it at three stars is the line up is getting ridiculous now and unfortunately this is a common thing literally in every single dim sum restaurant on the weekends in Scarborough and Markham. It's very off putting when you have to line up an indefinite amount of time, which is why I've stopped going here now.  If you choose to go, be hopeful that you'll get a table otherwise you may have to wait an hour or more. You could also try to beat the rush and get there as early as possible like.... 8am?"}
{"text":"A new Chinese restaurant in the landscape of Scarbourough, opened just 1 month ago by 2 partners with experience in various restaurants. The place falls in the middle in terms of its size and seatings amongst its peers. The decor is simple and more modern than the usual chinese restaurants.  We came for dinner on Boxing Day, and the place was packed but fortunately we were seated within a reasonable wait time. The service was rather slow. Took a long time for our first dish to come out. We were told that they were short one staff. The waitstaff were pleasant but understandably hurried.   We had the combo for 4-6 people. The pecking duck was succulent and oh so crispy. The pancakes for the duck were the thinnest i have ever seen in North American Chinese restaurants. Don't know if these were house made but that was incredible skill. I personaly prefer it to be just a bit thicker otherwise it tend to break when not careful but i think most ppl love the very thin pancakes.  The remainer dishes were pretty standard fare.  The pre-meal broth was light and tasty. Presentation-wise, we found that the serving dishes were a bit big, thus making their portion looked a bit small.   Overall great food and probably needs to work out a few kinks in the running of the business.  Will definitely try again here!"}
{"text":"Entirely average dim sum at prices that aren't particularly cheap. They have quail eggs on their deep fried taro puffs, but the taro puffs were still rather average."}
{"text":"Dinner was amazing, we got 2 bowls of soup( even have enough for lunch the next day!   I haven't had such yummy sweet and sour pork for a long time. The pork was still crispy after they had the sauce wrapped around each piece. I did wish they have more pineapples but I like how small the bell peppers are and pepper flavour does not coat the pork.  The veggie with fish filet was cooked very well as well. The stems of the veggies usually are more chewy because of the skin and I'm very happy to see the chef has peeled some of the skin.   The roast pigeon was really amazing. The skin was crispy and the meat was good."}
{"text":"Discovered this new place through yelp and I am so glad I did. Unlike other dim sum places, this one opens super bright and early: 8 am! So if you hate crowds and line up  for the early bird 9 am dim sum special, I suggest trying this place.  Place isn't busy when I was there but maybe cuz not a lot of people know about this new place yet or it was so freaking cold at -30 degrees Celsius!!  No wait for a table at 930am when I got there.  All small medium and large dim sum are $3 if order before 1050am for the early bird.  Service was quick and prompt and they kept checking on me for the tea choice. I didn't order yet since my friend hasn't arrived.  Since we were only two, we ordered conservatively 8 dishes. The list of desserts look scrumptious but alas we couldn't tried it all. Have to go back with a bigger group.  Food didn't disappoint. All the staples of dim sum such as har gow, shrimp cheung fun didn't failed. The standard  was rhere. The BBQ pork pineapple bun pastry was huge! I expected the calamari to deep fried but it was fried with the batter.   The restaurant has a main dining room and a slightly smaller room next to it once the main dining room is full.  Parking is a breeze and is located in the same plaza as the supermarket.  The bill ended up being $30 for two (tips not in this total) not bad as we expected to cost more"}
{"text":"Random find and same English name as a restaurant once in business at Market Village. As suspected, it seems like the same owner just relocated to this new location, and we did see a familiar face (employee/owner) walk into the restaurant.  I came here for dim sum before noon with my family and there was no lineup.  Majority of the customers were seniors and I didn't see too many young people or kids.  Dim sum was slightly pricey (in comparison to those that still offer $2.80 or under $3.00 dim sum for S/M/L not just for early bird special), but the quality was not bad at all.  Food also came quickly, and the servers were all very polite and professional.  My favourite dim sum, siu mai, was tasty but it lacked shiitake mushrooms. I liked how the steamed rice noodle rolls came with a separate bottle of soy sauce that was actually hot. That allowed us to control how much sauce we wanted.  The fried ham sui gok was really fresh and crispy.  I also enjoyed the steamed salted egg custard buns, yum!  Overall, a pleasant experience. It doesn't seem like they did much advertising nor were there any grand opening specials.  If you once frequented the previous \"Ginger And Onion,\" you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"We came here for a late lunch, and we were very glad we did! Turns out, it IS related to the old Ginger & Onion Cuisine that used to be at Market Village, and I'm happy to report to patrons of the former location that the food is as good as you remember. The dim sum might even be a bit better (the portions are certainly bigger), though the fun cart service is now gone. In the end, the food was excellent, and the service was good as well (the manager even remembered us from our many visits at the old location), and everything was priced well, though the restaurant has lost the noisy and fun atmosphere. Still, I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Had dim sum here this morning. Arrived for 10:30am and there was a short wait. The hostess assigning and seating folks was quick and calm. We ordered off their dim sum menu including shrimp dumplings, sui mai, fried squid, congee and many more items as we had a group of 6 people. All the items arrived hot and fresh. Some fried items were a touch too greasy but it was a very busy time and I understood. However the dumplings were filled generously and the portion sizing was great. They also have a great special before 11am where dishes were discounted and I believe one price (?) - not sure about this however our bill was very reasonable. The main reason for my 4 star rating was their service. The staff were attentive, proactive and made sure we had tea and cleared dishes throughout our dining experience. English, Cantonese and Mandarin were spoken fluently and for someone who can't speak Chinese, I found it very helpful! They also take reservations which is great too."}
{"text":"Very nice dim sum! I am not an expert in this particular cuisine but the dim sum was highly enjoyable. Lots of variety, fresh and bright flavours. My fav was the steamed chicken bun with lots of ginger and the har gow. The sticky rice in lotus leaf was ok - I prefer the version at Crown Prince. Portions are quite large so we over ordered but the leftovers reheated well. Total for 3 people was $60 (with leftovers to take home). I will definitely return."}
{"text":"We had dinner for my mother in laws. It was her birthday. There were 7 adults plus kids, so set meal was the way to go. Check out the photos. The lobster dish & pea shoot greens from the sea cucumber dish were my favourite.  Fanny was our server and she was very professional and attentive. We were in the private room, which is very nicely decorated, as is the restaurant; new and modern. Lots of parking near by. We will be returning for dim sum soon."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and BF for pre-Chinese New Year dinner and I was thoroughly impressed by the service and care the staff put into our dining experience (compared to other traditional Chinese restaurants).  We ordered steamed fish, Peking duck, and vegetables. It came with the daily soup and red bean soup. They showed us the fish they took from the tank to make sure it was a good size for the three of us before the prepared it. They also showed us the Peking duck and allowed us to take photos of it before they started slicing it. The dough pancake for the Peking duck was very soft and fresh which we were very impressed with. The server that sliced it was very careful and entertaining in preparing it and gave us plenty of photo op moments.   The food was great and the portions were fair. Everything came out in a timely fashion and all of the staff were very tentative to our needs before we even requested anything. Will definitely be returning!   Would give this place 4.5/5 because they were readjusting/disassembling/reassembling the table arrangements all around us during our meal and it got quite distracting. It was the end of the night and we were pretty much the only ones there so I see why they would be prepping their tables for the next day but it would've been nice if they waited until we were wrapping up to do the more distracting rearrangements."}
{"text":"On the pricey side but good quality. The braised pork belly is not as good. Very friendly service, clean place and nice decor.  Smarter menu but a bit more exquisite than regular Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"This place just opened up in the Alton Towers plaza.  They did a good job of renovating the space (it had been closed for almost 2 years). It is also quieter than other dim sum restaurants I've been to. We were able to get a table right away but this might change if more people know about here. Dim sum is 3$ before 10:55 and after it is a set price per size. We ordered 6 different dim sum items plus a dish of fried crispy noodles with shredded pork.   We were impressed with everything. Good taste and all is well cooked. We were also pleased with the quick and friendly service. Will come again, especially to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Trying to be a high end restaurant, but far from it. Absolutely horrid experience.  1. We bought the $288 dinner package, and there was a +$30 fee for being holiday season. That's fine, as long as the quality is good, and food comes promptly, but neither were the case.  2. Service took 2 hrs and 45 mins for our banquet style meal. They forgot numerous dishes, and our sequence was all backwards. We got soup as our fourth dish.   3. The 5 lb lobster was not even a ginger and onion stir fry. It had this nasty salted preserved egg coating that gave it a pasty,  powdery texture that tasted disgusting. I didn't eat it, and when someone at the claw, all this dark black water poured out of it the shell. Needless to say, this person's stomach hurt after.   4. They ran out of food, as the owner had to run to the Al Premium in the plaza to get additional groceries.   5. Numerous other tables were complaining about lack of food/service. I don't see this place surviving.  Experience = 1 star out of 5. Food taste = 1 star out of 5. Speed of Service = 0 stars out of 5.  Would have been better off going to Congee Queen or even Magic Wok."}
{"text":"Another Chinese restaurants in Scarborough.  Similar menus, Similar set up,  Similar taste.  I had been here for dim sum and dinner. Both times has an A OK experience.  Not too busy on weekdays for dim sum early bird but I like the fact that it opens at 8 am.  The more modern decor is quite nice. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We came here around 5pm for dinner and ordered the feast for 10 people. All the dishes were wonderful and very tasty. The lobster was fried with egg yolk and very large. The crispy skin chicken and duck were also roasted to perfection. Service was impeccable and attentive. Would definitely come back and highly recommend this to friends!"}
{"text":"I like this place. We came during the polar vortex when I was reluctantly leaving my house but was not disappointed  Location: Just south of Steeles  Parking: There's a lot of parking but be warned it shares this plaza with a grocery store so there are a lot of cars   Decor: Its nice inside.  Large round tables and two and four top square tables. Its a smaller dimsum place compared to some of the others but food comes quick and tables turn fast  Food: There were only two of us so we didn't order half the menu, although it was tempting!    BBQ pork buns. Yum. Octapus. Oh yeah yum. Rice rolls were on point. Desserts great! If you go before 10:50 they are cheaper too! Woo  Staff:  Nice. Helpful. Friendly  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I do not have many words here. As someone who did not grow up eating at Chinese cafe places, this is one that is a must try. Very traditional and good price point."}
