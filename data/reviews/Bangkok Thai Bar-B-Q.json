{"text":"Me and a friend ordered delivery through GrubHub, which was fine.  The bill, with tip, came to about $50 for two entrees and a dessert, which even for delivery seems high.  (I recently paid $65 for Chinese delivery to my office for four lunch specials, crab puffs, $8 delivery charge, and tip.)  I ordered the pineapple fried rice. I love spicy food. I'm the friend who makes fun of everyone else for eating things at 0 spiciness. I ordered this dish at a 6, thinking it would be on the hot side of medium spiciness. This was one of the spiciest dishes I have ever been served. It was inedible, because not only was it extremely spicy but the pineapples had been cooked so much they were completely flavorless, which is something I've never experienced before. So there was no balancing sweet flavor, it was just insane spiciness that overwheled everything. I am with a friend who also loves spicy food, and it was too much for him, too. He ordered another dish at a spiciness level of 3, which seemed to have no bite at all. Mine was definitely not twice as spicy as his, it was at least 10 times as spicy. I've ordered 8s and 9s that weren't this hot. He also was weirded out by the totally flavorless pineapple.   My friend's level 3 completely unspicy dish was fine; it was crab fried rice.  It wasn't anything special; just regular fried rice with a little bit of crab.  We ended up sharing that because neither of us could stomach mine.  I am addicted to sticky rice. It's one of my all-time favorite desserts. Bangkok Thai's sticky rice came in a sealed plastic bag, apparently directly out of the microwave, with a coconut milk sauce that didn't have nearly enough sugar. It was overall bland, I tried some of the nuts that were on the side with it; they turned out to be peanuts, which I don't love to begin with, but when a couple of peanuts totally overwhelm the taste of what you're eating, you know that it's not very flavorful. The coconut custard was OK, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I used to live near Thai Lotus and would frequently get delivery from them; their sticky rice with custard was AMAZING. I'm really sad there's no decent non-pizza places that deliver to my new apartment.   For a $50 delivery order, I was extremely disappointed. Worst $50 I've ever spent on a meal."}
{"text":"I stopped here after seeing the sign while randomly driving by. I was in the area for work orientation. LOVED it! I ordered the lunch special- chicken basil medium heat. Yummy. $6.99 included a large serving of entree, cup of soup, and spring roll. I plan to go back soon with my hubby."}
{"text":"Just had an order delivered to my job.  My co-worker and I were both happy that everything was prepared fresh and came hot!  They included everything we needed.  The only con is that there is a delivery fee AND a service fee totalling almost $10!  I'm assuming that included the driver's tip."}
{"text":"Vegetarian Review...  OK, So since 1-1-2013 I went vegetarian and have been rating the places I like and cater to the vegetarian and vegan who wants good food and a place their meat eating friends can enjoy too. So I was in the mood for some Tom Kha soup and something I hadn't tried before. I ordered the Tom Kha, mild and wished I had gone for the medium...a little too westerned down for one who likes a little bite back. I also got the Buddhist Garden (which they do offer with meat as well or tofu)...very tasty! I am trying to figure out why the place was empty on a Saturday night...I'm figuring it's new and hasn't been discovered yet. But if you live on the west side and want some very good Thai this place delivers....just be prepared to pay $5.99 for that delivery...better to just go and pick it up...worth it too. Would have been 5 stars if the veges had been just a LITTLE LESS COOKED...NOT SOGGY BUT NOT QUITE CRISP AS I LIKE THEM."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai restaurant I've tried in the Phoenix area! They have somtum and sticky rice on the menu so you know it's authentic. It wasn't very crowded for a Friday night but I attribute it to the location. As good as the food is, this place should be packed. The service was good and we didn't have to wait very long for our food even though our dish was supposed to take longer to cook. Honestly though, the food is so good that I'd wait hours if needed. This is my new go-to Thai place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for an unplanned business lunch, very impressed!  The serve was prompt and the food fantastic! Their prices were pleasantly lower than expected!  The noodle soup with chicken is worth another visit!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at the Bangkok Thai Bar-B-Q tonight and it was excellent. Great service and the Tilapia dinner I ordered was delicious. A fresh rose on every table is a charming extra! The Peanut sauce served with the delicious vegetarian spring rolls is outstanding! We shall be back and I will recommend this restaurant to family and friends."}
{"text":"Really really love this place. The green curry is the best I've ever had hands-down. The pad Thai is great and everything else we've had has been really very good. The atmosphere is not much to brag about but it's really all about the food isn't it? So if you want some really good curry I recommend giving them a try. We've never been disappointed and even our picky foodie friends enjoyed it"}
{"text":"Cheap and authentic tasting. Fresh meat and veggies. I like the feeling in the place with the elderly woman cooking in the back that seems to come out to see if we enjoyed our food. Don't ever order anything EXTRA SPICY unless you are looking for a cleansing effect."}
{"text":"We just got take out from Bangkok Thai and it was great.  The medium was plenty spicy, and we definitely like heat.  We got the red curry and the cat fish, both were excellent.  We'll certainly put this place into a regular rotation for takeout night."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Thai food and visit all the Thai places around. I ordered the Ma Su Man curry and my wife order the Galangal soup, which is a favorite. The food was bland and the service was slow for a 6:00 on a weeknight.  The food was not worthy of all the praise found on yelp, Siam's off 51st Ave and Northern is much better, and I thought it my duty to share you all the trouble of disappointment."}
{"text":"Love the Golden curry.  We come here from Gilbert once a month and always going to here.  I have not found anything in the east valley to be anywhere close."}
{"text":"Husband and I decided to try this place because our go-to, Krachai Thai, is closed on Sundays. Thank goodness! We may not have had the dining pleasure of this gem nestled within a strip mall. We started with the Fresh Rolls, which were fantastic. The basil, cilantro and fresh veggies melded perfectly with the tangy peanut sauce. I ordered the Sweet Basil Chicken, very tasty but could have stood more basil. Husband ordered Cashew Chicken which came with a generous serving of veggies, also very tasty. We opted for a 3-courser so we ended with the Coconut Ice Cream w Banana Fritters. Our server was very sweet and accommodating. She even threw in an extra fritter \"for the baby!\" (I'm pregnant). Very happy to have tried a new Thai spot in the area. We shall return!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a go to Thai food place. I had the spicy noodle which was delicious and had plenty of meat. My wife had the phad Thai and it was also quite delicious. We were the only ones here at the time which puzzled me based upon how good the food was. It may have been because it was slow but the service was also good. Highly recommend this Thai place"}
{"text":"This is unfortunate, but I ordered food for delivery from this restaurant using the yelp, online ordering which is run by a company called \"Eat 24\" at 7:45 PM tonight. At 8:45 PM I received a call from someone in San Francisco, saying that the delivery man was at the restaurant, but the restaurant was out of the duck that I ordered. I was starving, so I reluctantly switched my order to a salmon dish, & was told that my food would be delivered in 30 minutes. At 9:45 PM, (one hour later) I was still starving, so I called to cancel the order. Waiting 2 hours for food delivery from a restaurant less than 2 miles away is ridiculous.  I am not sure where the disconnect occurred, but if you have duck on your menu, you should be able to provide it to your customers when they order it. As a restaurant owner, you should also make sure that if you have an online ordering system in place, that it is functional, and that when your customers use it, they do not wait 2 hours for a meal.  Anyway, right after I cancelled the order, a delivery man called me and told me that he was in my apartment complex with my food. He said he had just picked it up, and that the restaurant didn't receive my order until about 9PM which was right before they closed, and that he had just picked it up. What happened between 7:45, and 9PM in the online ordering system? Anyway, between Bangkok Thai, Eat 24, and the 3rd party delivery company, someone completely screwed up my order, and I cancelled the delivery due to the lies, and the long wait. I cannot say if the food is any good here because I never got it, but I can suggest to the owners of Bangkok Thai that they find an online ordering/ delivery company that works."}
{"text":"Spring rolls and banana coins! Maybe not on the same plate but a must have here.  Fresh and delicious,  can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch recently and was very impressed.  My girlfriend and I got a take out order, she got Red Curry Chicken and I got the Sweet Basil Chicken Stir Fry.  Both were excellent.  The sauce in my stir fry had just the right amount of spice and both the vegetables and chicken were cooked very well.  She was also a big fan of her curry.  We will definitely be coming back in the future, I would give this 4.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I'm not extremely adventurous when it comes to Thai food, but I've tried the things I like at a lot of different Thai restaurants, and Bangkok is first-rate. The ambiance may not rival the class of a five star restaurant, but the food blows away any that other Thai that I've tried. If you don't mind a hole in the wall atmosphere, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food, good service, a little pricey but will definitely come back. Unlike other Thai joints, they actually check on you & refill your water here which is so nice! The 4 instead of 5 stars is because the waiter kept asking me if I was sure I wanted a spicy dish (I know, I know - I look too white to be able to handle spice but I love it!) and after I convinced him yes, the dish wasn't spicy at all and I HATE when they do that! I appreciate they're trying to protect me but they need to trust me when I order spicy. Food still had great flavor."}
{"text":"I have gone here a few times and the food is consistently delicious.  The service has also been excellent.  All the dishes are good portions and fresh.  One of the most overlooked dishes are the desserts.  OMG!  The sticky rice and coconut ice cream is delish! Like another reviewer, I would have given them the full 5 stars, but they did the same thing to me with the tip.  Without asking she took the entire $6 as tip!!!  When she said \"thank you, Good Night,\" I realized that I wasn't getting any change.   Other than that, I recommend it.  Just tell them you want your change."}
{"text":"I go here for lunch often.  Quick service and good food. The spicy fried rice and the spicy noodle are my favorites."}
{"text":"Yummy food. I order for delivery often. The delivery lady once kept a big fat tip for herself. I believe I gave her a twenty expecting change and didn't get any, she just said thanks and walked away. I found it strange but chalked it up to a mistake---but then I read on yelp that some lady kept a $9 tip and so now I think one of their employees just does this on purpose, knowing most people would be too embarassed to speak up. Food is good, though."}
{"text":"Very good food! The service is awesome and the ambiance is warm. Great lunch specials! :)"}
{"text":"Great tasting thai and really cheap! The place isn't busy most of the time so it's easy to get seated anytime.   I love the Pineapple and shrimp curry, spicy with the perfect amount of tang to balance it. The serving size is generous as well, easily enough for take home."}
{"text":"I went to this place for lunch because I purchased a gift certificate on restaurant.com. I was the only customer in the place. It was dark and reeked of a sour/moldy swamp cooler filter just begging to be changed.  I decided to try the food anyway because I consider myself a pretty adventurous eater. I ordered the chicken pad thai lunch special. It came with a spring roll and a cup of soup. I could hear my soup being microwaved in the back and my noodles being cooked. The spring roll was OK, the soup was absolutely disgusting, and the pad thai was just OK. I ended up not using my gift certificate because the price of the meal was very cheap. I would never eat inside the restaurant again, but I might be tempted to try it again just for take-out."}
{"text":"The food is great. The levels of spiciness they have in their entrées is perfect. Plus they serve Diet Coke."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat via Yelp, and this restaurant pop up. After reading the reviews, I decided to give this place a try; and I'm glad that I did. I called in my order for pick-up. I decided on the spicy noodles & yellow curry.   The spicy noodles: you can add your level of spice; I picked hot. Just the right level of heat to the dish! You can also choose a meat; my pick was chicken.  The yellow curry: being a curry lover, you will love this dish. Just the right amount of everything. You can also choose a meat; my pick was chicken. Next time I order this dish, I will ask for light carrots.  Overall my total cost for this meal was $21.00 .. I will be adding this place to my bookmarks for future orders.   #ilovegoodfood"}
{"text":"I admit I'm not a big fan of going to grungy area. Don't get me wrong the restaurant itself is clean and reasonably comfortable. I just prefer to be in an area that take cares of its surrounding.   In any case I gave this place a 4/5 stars solely because of the Thai food they offered and customer service. Before I started plant based diet, I used to get their BBQ chickens. They were DELICIOUS! Also they have a tasty Thai tea here. It's very sweet though to if you are avoiding sugar it's probably not your thing."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the combination pad thai spicy. It was the best noodle dish I've ever had. Next time I will be ordering this with shrimp and extra spicy . My husband ordered the mild beef basil and he loved it! He wants to try the chicken basil next time. I tried the thai tea...it wasn't my cup of tea. It was good and sweet and I can't really describe the flavor. If I had to guess what is in it, i would guess a hint of sweet potato. Keep in mind that this is my fist time trying out this drink; I'm no connoisseur.   Service was smooth. Water cups were always filled. Dirty plates removed promptly. Waiter did great multitasking with take out customers, phone calls, and us. Too bad more people weren't eating there. Left a nice tip.   We will be going back soon, sometime for lunch to try out the specials"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I placed a $50 order online but needed to ensure the special instructions were understood, so I called the store and a gentlemen claiming to be the manager answered the phone. When I explained the instructions to him he rudely said I'm sorry I don't have your order yet I can't help you. Again I said well my order should be there any second and again he said rudely, I can't help you. I then told him I would like to cancel my order and he said that's fine if that's what you want to do. Nobody has good customer service these days! I will be telling everyone not to eat here!"}
{"text":"Got the lunch special mango delight and red curry. Both were delicious. I especially loved the mango delight. I ordered online through yelp and linked my card for 10%cash back. It was easy and my food was waiting and paid for when I walked in! I will definitely do this again."}
{"text":"I ordered (for delivery) chicken satay, tom yum soup and pad si-ew.  All of it are so delicious!  I would have given it 5 star but I asked for extra sauce on the pad si-ew but I didn't get it."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here and wasn't disappointed. They were very fast and friendly when we picked it up. My husband ordered sweet basil which could've used quite a bit more basil. I ordered spicy fried rice and it was very good. The prices we reasonable. Our bill was less than $20. This is definitely a family-owned restaurant which I really liked. They had a cute little bar in their with a great selection of Asian beers. Next time I go I will eat in so I can try some!"}
{"text":"Grubbed here for the first time just a couple days ago. Lodged in a strip mall, and distinguished by red, claw-like font, 'Bangkok' seemed like a decent place to fill the tums.  A little reluctant to enter, the blinds were open just a tad, giving us a peek in. At 7:45pm, no patrons at all-- you might have assumed they were about to close. Assumption false though, when we tried the door, and slipped right in. We were greeted by two nice guys who happily allowed us to choose any of the 30/30 vacant tables. Thanks.   The menu included all the common offerings found in most Thai places here, so I guess we played it safe by ordering the combo appetizer, combo seafood soup, pad thai, and thai bbq. Yes, a lot of food...the guy did not hesitate to remind us to \"save space in your stomach\"...Thanks again, guy.   Combo appetizer was...alright. And by alright, I mean, their fishcakes were out of supply and had to be replaced by chicken satay (which was, not so succulent, but whatever). Other members of the combo appetizer were eggrolls (with very crispy wrapper, but minimal filling), crab puffs, and fried tofu. All pretty \"OK\" appets, accompanied by the usual sauces. Pad thai was underwhelming, and add to that, anemic. BBQ was, BBQ. The only somewhat tasty thing was the combination seafood soup--tom yum goong base, with fishes of the sea, sparse distribution of shrimp, and rough cuttlefish. Coconut ice cream did not hint any coconut, but rather shaved ice with coconut flavor.   These eats, for roughly, $80. Really...80??? Yeah, that's what I keep asking myself. Most likely, will not return."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is extremely clean and spacious. I think the color and the atmosphere is extraordinarily amazing. Please come and see for yourself. The lighting is great and the service is very genuine.   I would recommend this to anyone willing to try new food like Thai. There are also levels of spicing."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around! We have not gone to another Thai place since we found Bangkok and that has been over a year now. Located in a strip mall might cause some to pass by with out ever trying it, as that was our first impression too. I am so glad we stopped . Now when we go they already know what and how we want or meal. Wonderful family owned place. They even taught me how to make thai tea."}
{"text":"THE BEST THAI FOOD IN GLENDALE!!! Seriously. The prices are so decent and the food is fantastic every time!!  Not to mention their Thai tea is the Bomb."}
{"text":"They have a Consistently Delicious variety! Fresh taste! Highly recommend for take-out Thai Food in Glendale AZ!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Ordered the pad thai and it was lacking something, fish sauce, something was off track. Satay was decent though. I may be slightly biased having just returned from a long trip to Southeast Asia but even the wife agreed the pad thai was missing some key flavors. The map on Yelp is also wrong, it's off of 51st and Thunderbird, not near Cactus."}
{"text":"I've been to Thailand and honestly the food at Bangkok Thai is super authentic and delicious. I usually order out (and my food is always ready within 20 minutes) but the couple of times I've eaten at the restaurant, service has been fine. There usually aren't many people there, but every time I've been there's always at least one table full. Seriously the food is great!"}
{"text":"Locate on the NW corner of 51st Ave and Thunderbird, you won't see this hidden gem, in an unassuming looking plaza, from the street.  When you walk in, you'll like the simple yet stylish atmosphere (in comparison to similar food places).  The food I have tried is excellent.  The yellow curry comes as hot as you like, and it comes at lunch with small, but tasty soap an egg roll.  I try to come back to this place at least every two weeks, despite having to drive 40 streets through local traffic.  It's worth it to me."}
{"text":"Great place for a delicious a Thai lunch. Fresh ingredients, great flavors, and nice size portions. Lovely atmosphere, clean, relaxing music while you enjoy your meal. Lunch special offers many options from noodle dishes, woked dishes, and plenty of curry options, and starts at $6.99. Not much to look at from the outside, but is so GOOD! I will back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a date night last Friday night and was fairly happy with the result.  I ordered the spicy fried rice with beef which I asked for \"hot\". My wife ordered spicy noodle dish which she ordered \"medium\".  Both dishes tasted excellent and the spicy element was perfect for both of our dishes.  The portions sizes were fairly size able for the price of the entrees (~10 each) and I had enough for leftovers which is pretty rare for me especially since it was a late dinner.    The one complaint I had was with the dessert. My wife loves sticky rice, especially when the mango is in season.  After we had returned our menus we decided to get the sticky rice without looking at the price when our server told my wife they did have mango available.  The dessert itself was not bad but I was taken aback when I saw the price being about 8 dollars.  Based on the portion size this was at best worth 5 and I felt lampooned but since I didn't check the price I just paid for the meal and hope I learned my lesson for next time."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai dishes include eggplant and their menu does not disappoint. I got a lunch special that includes rice and an egg roll with a spicy eggplant 4 spice. All for under $9. It was spicy but not over the top. Keep in mind, I eat spicy food regularly. Mom and pop spots are my 1st choice and this one is on the top of my radar. Quality food, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Was deciding on lunch on Postmates and I always saw them on there but looked past because I've never had curry before. Ordered the Red Curry with chicken and the spicy fried rice with chicken......amazing! So glad I decided to give them a try... Definitely will be coming in to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem. It's tucked into a dumpy strip mall but don't let the looks fool you. This place has excellent food. We went at about 4pm on a Friday and were the only customers. I got the Pad Woon Sen with chicken which was absolutely delicious. My daughter got the Panaang Curry with tofu which she really enjoyed too. With my meal I got the Thai iced tea and it is great. The waitress was very nice and the food came out quick. We will DEFINITELY be returning."}
{"text":"This was a most unexpected delight. First we were greeted by Manola, she guides us on what to eat and made the experience enjoyable. We tried the egg rolls, spicy beef noodle and red curry shrimp. They were all hot, tasty, just the right spice and excellent food quality. This is a local joint very unassuming but worth it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I've been here 4 or 5 times now at both lunch and dinner times. I'm not sure why there's never anyone else in here though. Maybe it's more of a pick up place. The servers are so sweet. Lunch specials are $6.99 and include soup and a fresh roll. Tons of vegetarian options - they do their tofu really well. I recommend the cashew nut with tofu.   I'm still trying to figure out their spice levels. Once I ordered spice level 5 and couldn't even eat the dish. During lunch they don't even ask your spice level preference and it comes with no spice at all."}
{"text":"Great food great price I like this place. Such great service and good atmosphere! I usually order the coconut soup, basal chicken, papered fish, patti, and lapgi."}
{"text":"I really like this place, I have tried several of the items off the menu , and they are all good, service has been very good, my only complaint is how cold it can be in there. One time i went there, I was happy to walk outside and warm up."}
{"text":"I got the duck panang curry and all the duck was bad! It smelled gross and tasted even worse, like that bad poultry taste. Also got pad Thai that was mediocre. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered quite a bit of food to my hotel and was pretty disappointed. The pineapple fried rice was very oily and didn't have any real flavor, and the flat spicy noodles were also quite oily. The winner was the soft spring rolls which were the perfect amount of crunchy with the accompanying peanut sauce. If I went again, would probably only get the spring rolls. The two of them were big enough to fill me up."}
{"text":"Ridiculously DELICIOUS! I've gone for lunch and dinner and both times have been really pleasant. It's in a hidden area; older, quaint place but definitely recommend the lunch special with their soup and roll and curry!!! Let's get them more traffic!"}
{"text":"First visit and was impressed clean restaurant and staff was friendly. Yellow chicken curry was tasty had nice spice level."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed their food and service.  It was late and we did takeout on a Monday night.  Surprising how many Thai restraunts are not open on Monday night.   The Red and Green Curries were delicious as was the Spicy noodles and Phad Thai.  Egg plant with chicken and basil beef also wonderful.  I was also surprised that there were not more people eating inside.  It's clean and the service was excellent.  I asked for peanut sauce and some extra hot spices to go  They mixed up the peanut sauce fresh at no charge.  Very accommodating.  I really liked the young couple that helped us.  If you like Thai better support this restaurant. Really enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"So, living with my mom, we do a lot together. If we could do one thing everyday it would be eating Thai food. Imagine our sheer state of awe and immense gratefulness at the discovery of this most precious gem!! Don't read any more reviews, just GO!! We as a community need to keep this place in business!!! My mother and I cannot do it alone! We need YOU!! Order the Red Curry with broccoli, Pad Woon Sen, Broccoli Delight & Pad Thai...you will not be disappointed!! As if that's not enough to get you in the door, THEY HAVE LUNCH SPECIALS!!! So get on it!!"}
{"text":"Great service and tasty food!"}
{"text":"I'm glad my coworkers knew about this place,  because I've driven by and missed it. Not much else happening at that strip mall.  I had their pad Thai and Thai iced coffee , both were great.  They have large servings,  so I took my left overs home,  and my SO loved them as well."}
{"text":"searched this place before we go.went to this place with a friend.the food was ok service was ok,the place is ekkkkkkkkk... I would not go back again !!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! The food was delicious and cooked perfectly. While the restaurant may look a little rough on the outside, it's very clean and neat on the inside. Highly reccommend!!"}
{"text":"Had a taste for Thai and was at the hospital so thought we would drop in. As said before, the place was completely empty so we did not expect much. We were surprised by excellent eggrolls and spring rolls very good Pad Thai and a beef dish with thick noodles and veggies or I don't recall the name. All the food was very savory and flavorful not sure about that earlier comment but ours was very good. We will definitely come back again! Don't let the outside ambiance fool you the food is excellent.  It seems they do a very good takeout business as well. Something to keep in mind!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and it's not too far from home.  I'm a big fan of Thai food, in fact it's my #1 favorite cuisine.  I haven't found my go-to Thai place in Arizona yet, so I'm still searching.  I was hoping the search would be over, but sadly it isn't.  This place is in an unassuming strip mall filled with random shops.  I only remember this spot because I had to take my dog to the veternarian nestled in this strip mall.   What I do like about this place is that it is nicely decorated.  And the lunch special pricing is pretty good.  Otherwise, I would only come here for lunch and that's about it.  The service was very slow.  Not a fan of waiting when we are on a time crunch.  It seemed like forever passed until we got waited on.  Only one person was working on the floor, which is fine, but please don't just stand around the register while patrons are waiting to order.  I had panang curry and it was watered down and pretty bland.  The meat was chewy and not soft.  My husband had pad thai which was much better, but by not much.  I am quite puzzled by the high reviews and I don't think my experience reflects this.  Overall, I feel it was just okay.  I don't think I'll return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great food, quiet and clean atmosphere, great service and selection of food, Both times I have been in with my family we have been only people in resturant. REALLY hope they stay open, great food, great soup and vegan choices."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here one evening when we didn't feel like cooking. As others have mentioned, don't let the outside stop you from trying this place. It's a generic looking strip mall, but inside this place is quite nice. We ordered online, using EatStreet (I believe), and when we arrived to pick up our order a very friendly woman helped us at the counter and our food was hot and ready to go.  For starters we had Chicken Satay and Crab Rangoons. The Crab Rangoons were what I expect, no complaints there. The Chicken Satay was really tasty - cooked properly and well seasoned; served with a nice peanut satay sauce (it's odd how this sauce differs from Thai restaurant to Thai restaurant, and Bangkok Thai's is a pretty good one).  For entrees, my wife ordered The Queen's Fried Rice and I had the Spicy Noodle with chicken. The Queen's fried rice is filled with generous portions of chicken and shrimp and the rice was cooked nicely - soft and of a good consistency. Spicy Noodle is simple but filled with good flavors. Not very spicy in my opinion, but I eat a lot of hot food so I have a bias. I added some chili paste at home and went on happily.  This was a 4 star experience and we'll certainly be back to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Awesome food, it was just like being back in Thailand, original, genuine Thai food. Highly recommend you to try it. We're definitely coming back..."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are DELICIOUS!  Number 15 is my favorite.   Thai coffee is so good.   Hidden gem in an old plaza!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant!! Bangkok has delicious made-to-order Thai food. The Tom Yum Soup is not to be missed. I wasn't a fan of curry but once I learned Thai curry is much different than Indian curry I decided to try it. Now I am hooked on the Panang Curry....mmmm. Every dish can be ordered to your desired curry-hotness. Next time I'll try the Tom Yum Fried Rice.There are so many dishes to choose from, I suggest bringing others with you so you may try many at the same time. The service was great, the restaurant clean. If it's not busy don't let that fool you. That can change in a minute. I noticed they did receive many take-out calls while I was there. Whoever said the west side restaurants were all chain restaurants needs to eat here!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some great Thai food, a good selection of beers to match the food, and a clean cute restaurant, this is your place.  The service was excellent. The noodles were fresh, the curry was tasty but the soup with the coconut milk in it was my favorite!!!  They also seemed to have a good take out business."}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough! This place is definitely  a gem!!! The Panang is the the best I've EVER had!! The veggies in it are perfect! The Curry puffs, and crab puffs will not disappoint, very very tastey!! I can't say enough good things! Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Good food with a good selection for vegetarians/vegans.  I've never had any problems with the service. The prices are reasonable. It's definitely a go to if I am craving curry."}
{"text":"A must for all Glendale natives. My good friend frequented this establishment with her family, and after being friends for some 5 to 6 odd years finally shared this little gem with me. I navigated here with her and 4 mutual friends, whom after a long day in the pool, needed some sustenance.  The waitress was super friendly, it probably helped that 3 of my friends had recently visited Thailand and had plenty to talk with her about.  We had the place all to ourselves. Very cozy. Excited to share our meal \"family style\" we ordered some wonton soup and the fisherman's platter, thai iced teas, and the coconut pineapple fried rice-A MUST. In addition we ordered sweet and sour pork, pad thai- which is the best I've ever had, and a beef dish, blanking on the exact name. We devoured everything, I'm sure the employees were waiting for us to lick the plates.  I have not one complaint about this place and look forward to going back for more!"}
{"text":"I ordered take out for my husband and I. We ordered yellow curry, spice, and pad see wu (in not sure how you spell it). We've been going to another place off of bell and this place is a whole lot better. We're officially switching thai restaurants. The only thing is we like our food a little spicier so next to me we will ask.   My husband said the restaurant looks clean inside although on the outside the building is run down which has nothing to do with the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been wanting Thai cuisine for a couple months now and finally got it. It was so worth the wait... Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The food was sub par. Kind of greasy for Thai which is generally clean, fresh and balanced. The flavor was on the bland side and the price was a bit higher than other places of a similar style. It wasn't awful but I left without the feeling of needing to return again."}
{"text":"The best Thai food west of Texas! I had tom yum shrimp soup. Sweet Spicy Basil seafood with Bren rice. And Green Curry chicken. Ate  less than half. Taking half Togo for lunch and dinner. Generous portion.  Go with Med-to hot spicy. Casual ambiance. But fresh food. Good prices. My total was $35. That's almost 3 meals."}
{"text":"I went to Bangkok and loved the papaya salad. It came out crisp and with just enough heat. their lunch fresh rolls and soup are a great free addition to their lunch menu. It was good because we petty much ate as soon as we sat down(perfect to get fed ASAP on a short lunch hour).  It looked pretty slow when we came in\ but then again they likely just opened around 11 on a monday.Very reasonable lunch prices and dinner didn't look that much more. I have to come back on a weekend for dinner."}
{"text":"My husband I LOVE Thai food, we tried the chicken pad Thai and chicken fried rice. Both were delicious. We will definitely be going back for more! Next on my list to try is papaya salad."}
{"text":"My wife and I love Thai food, however this place doesn't know what Thai food is. It's always empty and for good reason, it's horrible. Do not waste your money here!!!"}
{"text":"I really love this place!  The owners are a nice family.  The food is deli-sh.  I have a few favorites here.  The Pad See Ew is fantastic.  If you want your dish to be served spicy or mild (me), they can provide.  Their soup is the best I've had anywhere.  Very affordable and a great service and nice looking atmosphere.  P.S. The guy from Arkansas that just not only obliterated every aspect f this restaurant, but also made a vague accusation about the legitimacy of the restaurant and then insinuated that we reviews are \"ghost writers\" and not actual patrons--let me say this-- I have lived in the neighborhood of this restaurant since 1985.  It used to be a Mexican restaurant that closed years ago.  These owners have renovated and restored this place to make a great place to be an day of the week.  The servers are the nicest and most helpful servers ANYWHERE.  And finally, this is Arizona, it's dusty,  its like going to the beach and complaining that it's \"sandy\".   Obviously you are completely entitled to you complete opinion in a review website.  But the accusations are ridiculous,,, stick to the food, atmosphere, service. I noticed both of your total 2 reviews are scathing.."}
{"text":"I go here usually when I want some Queen's Fried Rice or Tomyum Fried Rice. Appetizers here and there or traditional dishes like their Pad Thai or curry are always consistent in quality, overall a pleasure to eat at. The person at front taking orders is always polite and relaxed when greeting customers which is a plus. I recommend others to give this place a try and see how they like it for themselves."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I come from an amazing Thai family so I've had my share of mouthwatering home cook meals. But now that I live on my own this is the place I go when I can't go home. I'm all about supporting local family businesses and this place has my thumbs up. I hope they don't plan on moving anytime soon because there aren't many Thai restaurants that I actually want to go to. Plus THEY DELIVER?!? I'm sold. So what there's a fee? There's a fee for everything and I don't mind paying for this one."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and am a regular here. The waitress knows me and what I order for lunch. The food is really good and staff has always been friendly. Sadly on my most recent trip there was a new waitress...no big deal except that service was much slower than usual despite there being only 3 people dining at the time. I didn't get my usual egg roll that comes with lunch (forgot about it until it got too late to ask), and was charged an extra $2 which I didn't catch until after I paid and was on the way out. Really hoping this was a one time fluke..."}
{"text":"Ordered pick up came in order wasn't ready they mistook my order and just got started spent my lunch time waiting for an order that was called in 30 minutes prior! Pad Thai was bland with 0 spice after I had requested it and she assured me the cook knew!"}
{"text":"Carl had never tried Thai food. ( Blasphemy) so I decided to pick up some Thai for dinner from this place which is literally around the corner from where he lives. It was almost closing time, I (like 8:30pm) but it was empty and the staff were still very friendly ( not put off like some places are when you come in that late) I ordered some curry puffs for our appetizer and sweet basil chicken and pad thai for our entrees. The curry puffs were delicious. So delicious that we were both fighting over the last one lol. Carl really enjoyed his sweet basil chicken, especially since I got it extra spicy.  My pad thai was a little disappointing. It really didn't have any flavor and the noodles were stuck together in one big heap. Really bland and I was let down. But it will not discourage me from going back to try other dishes, just not that one. I give this place 3.5 stars and I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm glad I found this place!  I had been looking for a thai place to try after our last adventure in dining thai had ended badly and found Bangkok Thai BBQ revitalized my hope for enjoying thai food.  First off, their Thai Tea is fantastic. Its probably on the sweeter side for most people but I think its amazing. My girlfriend and I crave them constantly and currently this is the only place we know that serves it so well.  In regards to their dishes, amazing as well. I tried both the Pineapple Curry with Pork and Sweet Basil with Pork. The Pineapple curry was something I had never tried and would get again and again from now on however, the pineapple slices themselves were not the sweet focal point but rather the tomatoes which I loved. I don't even like tomatoes! The sweet basil I also had with pork and was also very good. I was worried when I ordered it that the basil flavor might be too strong or overpowered but it came out just right, very balanced.  Overall, I'm coming back for my thai tea and those curry puffs they serve as appetizers. They are unreal and you will fight over them when you are down to the last puff."}
{"text":"This Thai Restaurant offers many items that I haven't seen before on Thai Menus. We started with curry puffs. They were crispy won ton skins stuffed with marinated seasoned minced chicken and sweet potatoes. They were tasty but didn't remind me of curry....just tasty.  I had the chili eggplant with chicken. This dish was delicious! My chicken was tender and the sauce was bright, tasty and accented with lots of fresh herbs. For me it had all the right flavors going on. My husband had the sweet basil with beef. The beef was slightly chewy but the flavor of the sauce was good and this dish was infused with basil flavor like it should be. We both ordered our dishes HOT and they were perfect for us. Real pepper was used for heat and not powder like from some other Thai Restaurants.  Portions were good. I thought they were large for Thai.  They have sticky rice and brown rice on the menu.  Many seafood dishes are offered and they have FOUR kinds of fish on the menu.  At the time of this review they have these fun complimentary scratch off lottery type of tickets were everyone is a winner and you can get some money off your next order. (We both got $5.00 scratch offs)  Service was very friendly and the restaurant appeared clean.  Slight update......Feb-2016 Did take out and the food wasn't nearly as great.....Not sure....if they went down or just don't do take out well...."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Thai food and never thought for a second there would be such a good place to eat it in Arizona. Prices were fair, and food was delicious. My dad lives in some apartments across from this shopping center, and eats here alone all the time - I did feel bad when I heard about that, but then when I tried the food I understood why: it's worth the solo trek.   The dish I liked the best was Chili Eggplant, and the egg rolls were crispy (pretty much standard egg rolls) and the dipping sauce was great. I tried the Spicy Noodles as well, and was delighted. Great, attentive service, too. I hope lots of people decide to eat here because it was EMPTY both of the times I visited. I want it to stay open forever so my pops can get his Thai food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and very reasonable prices. Great fresh spring rolls!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in North Phoenix. The Thai green curry is incredible. I also recommend the Queen's fried rice."}
{"text":"Once upon a time in a strip mall far far away was a little Thai restaurant whose exterior appearance was deceiving.   You see, young reader, the same derelict strip mall held a charter high school and a run down ACE Hardware. But those who could successfully navigate the cavernous parking lot and fight the Jack-in-the-Box monster were handsomely rewarded for their efforts.   Yes, Thai Iced Tea so fantastical and Coconut Pineapple Rice and Chicken that could please the pickiest princess were housed within it's otherwise frightening walls.   The homemade Coconut Iced Cream and Sweet Rice is worthy of its own fairy tale. Perfect was its flavor and consistency of texture.   The kind owners are more than willing to bestow their magical gifts of food on any weary traveler that should choose to stop in for a feast. A small fee is required for their kindness, but even a pauper can afford this fare."}
{"text":"This place is authentic, my wife was in Thunderbird hospital and was craving Thai food so I looked it up on the map.  She said it was the best pad Thai she's ever had and the yellow curry was excellent as well.  Now I have to take the long drive each time she wants Thai but it's totally worth it"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a date night with the fiancee. At work we order from Thai House on Shea in Scottsdale which is always good food,. I was in the mood for Thai and live in Peoria so this place was fairly close.  The restaurant was empty except for one other table of 4 people, which is great for me because I don't like crowded noisy restaurants. The place was clean. We were greated and seated right away. We ordered Thai tea YUM!  We ordered the spicy Shrimp soup for an appetizer. Then we waited. 10 -15 minutes later our soup was brought out. I liked it - but it was chicken not shrimp (that's one of the reasons I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars). Apparently the fiancee wasn't reading when I asked him if he wanted to try that soup, it has mushrooms and he hates mushrooms, but he said he wanted to try it. I thought it had good flavor. Watch out for the hard crunchy things (I think it was pieces of ginger) as they have a bite to them and are bitter. The waitress came to ask how our soup was and immediately appologized for the mistake of chicken instead of shrimp. She even had the cook make a small bowl of the shrimp soup for us. Our entress were brought out about 10 - 15 minutes later. I had the shrimp and pineapple curry. Yum! (not as good as Thai House but a close comparison, I'll ask for it to be a little spicer next time as I asked for mild). The fiancee order the cashew chicken YUM! the sauce was very good, not too salty. Lots of good sized cashews. We ordered fried rice to serve it over. Everything was very delicious. When we were almost finished the waitress came out with a bowl of coconut ice cream with chocolate drizzle. VERY YUM!! She said she was very sorry for the mix up with the soup and wanted us to try the ice cream. She said it is homemade with organic coconut milk. VERY nice gesture.  Excellent customer service (other restaurants could learn a thing or two from them) will be back when the Thai craving hits again."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has skated by with 4 stars. It's not like me to be scathing, but I'm about to scathe away. If I could, I would give ZERO stars... 1 star is sheer generosity,  Let's begin with, the place was dead so there is absolutely no excuse...     We ordered a cucumber salad and a beer along with 2 entrees.    -I ordered a Singha from the menu, but as it turns out- they only carried one brand of the extensive imported beer list... Ok, so I'll have the Lao beer...  -I had to wait for my beer, until they brought out the cucumber salad. Ok... I will wait for my drink to be brought out with the appetizer...  -Cucumber salad is literally about 8 cucumber chunks floating with serrano chilis and red onion in 3 inches of some kind of clear gel... I've never seen a cucumber salad in a bowl of tangy gel... it grossed me out immediately... but I digress. I didn't eat that.  -Our entrees come out. We are brought white rice rather than the brown rice we ordered.   -The pad thai with vegetables that we ordered comes out with only noodles... Apparently, the restaurant RAN OUT OF VEGETABLES. How does that happen in an Asian restaurant?   -Both the pad thai noodles with not as much as some green onion- just sauced noodles and yellow curry are completely mild- we ordered them hot. We also asked for extra chili sauce when we placed out order... of course that didn't happen.   -We weren't even provided with plates or serving spoons. We literally had to pick up the bowl and pour the curry onto our plates.  - As for utensils, we were only given forks, no knifes, spoons, nothing...   -Finally, they did bring some brown rice out and it was an instant microwaved brown rice... GROSS.  This place is TERRIBLE!!! Go to Siam on Northern. The only reason we weren't at Siam is because they are closed on Mondays.  Tonight was our meatless Monday- what a disappointing experience. We will never come back!"}
{"text":"We were in the area and were searching for a good place to eat so we stopped by. It was pretty quiet and empty inside but it was very clean and the waitress was very polite so we stayed. I enjoyed the music it was soft 70s rock at a perfect listening level. We ordered coconut chicken soup level medium spicy and then spicy beef noodle. We love spicy food and the medium was easily tolerable not that spicy. The coconut broth was my favorite part of the meal I could take a gallon home to drink it's so good. Service was fast and she was very honest and sweet, her name was Som. For desert we ordered the coconut sticky rice which was a very neat combination of sweet and salty, being pregnant I found it to be amazing. I would recommend this place if you're looking for good Thai food.  This strip mall looks kind of ghetto but there is plenty of parking and our car was completely safe."}
{"text":"I didn't like this at all and I'm pretty easy with Thai food. The protein in the chicken massuman curry was...iffy. Either unrecognizable or waaaay waaay overcooked."}
{"text":"We love Thai food. We have been to Thailand and have had many traditional Thai dishes. If you want great traditional Thai food, Bangkok Thai has it! The service was excellent, and while our order took a touch longer than I might have liked, it was all fresh, hot and delicious! We ate family style, so we got to sample several different dishes. Not a single one was disappointing! Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Perfection!  Just gave this gem a second try and can I say \"HOME-RUN\"!!!  I had the venerable Pad Thai which could not have been better had I been in Thailand myself.   Additionally I had a sensational Shrimp Red Curry that was simply delicious.  The prices for food with this quality is unmatched.  The proprietors Monolo and husband Soney are just the kindest and hardest working people on the west-side.  Please give this oasis a try!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter here for lunch last week- it was great!  The Thai tea is delicious, and so was the chicken satay with the really tasty cucumber sauce.  She got the  #56, flat noodles with broccoli and chicken in a brown sauce...she loved it. And she's kind of a picky eater.  I got the red curry pork- very good and spicy.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We ordered take out and our food was ready in 15 minutes. We didn't dine in but the interior of the restaurant was really nice. Don't let the shabby exterior fool you. One order was for cashew chicken and we requested no spice and it was as requested. The second order was for Phad Prig Sog with chicken and we requested spice level two which was just right! The portions were perfect and the price was right. We will definitely be back and I can't wait to try different entree's"}
{"text":"The best place in Phoenix to eat. Done! Mic drop! Spicy noodles is a win, but don't sleep on the pad Thai."}
{"text":"Thai menu is exactly what you would think to find for a great Thai cafe with some surprises. The soups were our particular favorites. The mainstay of every visit. Service can be disconnected from what you think you need but it could be a communication issue."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Great food, warm service, and reasonable prices. It's definitely worth a shot to try this cute mom and pop restaurant. I have been here at least five times and they never disappoint.   Dishes that I've tried: - Pad See Ew w/ tofu: This is a flat noodle with some kind of special sauce, egg, and broccoli. Tastes more like Chinese food to me which is why I like it. I like to get it with tofu but if you can also get it with a meat. Usually comes not spicy but you can tell them to spice it up more levels if that's what you're into. - Spicy Noodle (forgot what the thai name is) - This dish is similar to Pad See Ew but with more basil and more spice. I think it has carrots and onions instead of broccoli. Either way, this is my go to dish when I want something spicy and flavorful. - Soups: I've only tried one and I forget what the name was (Tom Yum?) but I LOVED it. It comes in a hotpot and should be shared (unless you are a glutton like me). Also has a basil taste which some people cannot handle but if you don't mind a little basil, give it a try.  - Egg rolls (vegetarian): They were okay. I've never been a fan of vegetarian egg rolls (I prefer pork) but these aren't bad. I tend to like Vietnamese egg rolls the best. - Panang Curry w/ tofu: This is my favorite curry because it has a slight sweetness to it (from the coconut) and when I choose a medium spicy level, the sweet balances out the spicy. This curry is creamier than the red and green curries. The tofu soaks up all that creamy goodness. Yum.  - Thai Tea: All I can say is if you don't want water, get the Thai tea. Sweet and refreshing.  All in all, there are a lot of good Thai places in this area (I've tried around 4-5). I go here the most because of its consistency, warmness, and its price compared to similar Thai places."}
{"text":"It's tucked away in the far end of the building but is quite an enjoyable place to eat. I had the BBQ chicken that was excellent. The curry is quite good. The dessert was definitely my favorite with the banana medallions. So delicious and quick friendly service. I love Thai food and this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"Getting beyond the emptiness of the place and the pop music. The red and yellow curry did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I would love to give this restaurant a 5-star review.  The food was absolutely delicious, and still hot, even though we ordered delivery.  The problem I have with this place is how long it took to get the food.  It took 2 HOURS.  Let me repeat... 2 HOURS to get our food.  It was bad enough that the estimated time was 1 hour, but as we had decided on delivery early in the evening, well before we planned on eating, it worked out... well, in theory.  By the time the food came, I was very cranky.  Fortunately for Bangkok Thai, one plate of rice/masaman curry, and an episode of Gilmore Girls later, my crankiness was completely gone."}
{"text":"If you are a Pad Thai lover, I highly recommend this place. It's one of the best I ever ate, enjoy it every time"}
{"text":"they have a chicken with lemon grass and coconut milk soup that I swear has crack in it because I can't get enough. I think it's the #18 or something. My girlfriend and I have cravings for it. It's so good, refreshing and just awesome. She loves the curry and some other dishes. The staff is friendly. Most of the time it's just us or maybe another couple in the restaurant and try the thai tea"}
{"text":"While in Phoenix we were without a car and land locked to our hotel so we decided to order Bangkok Thai BBQ though UberEats. I ordered the Sweet and Sour Duck, BBQ Chicken, and Pineapple Fried Rice. The portions were really big. We ended up not eating half of it because there was enough for 6 people. I can't say enough good things about the service. I asked for plates, silverware, and extra napkins and when the order got there all of that was there. I have had restaurants deliver through Uber and not get so much as a fork. Really great service and the food was good. I can only imagine how great the service would have been had we gone to eat in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I eat at Bangkok Thai Bar-B-Q once a week for takeout.  Their food is fabulous and they put them in takeout containers that don't spill all over the place as you eat it.  My favorite this far is the cashew chicken.  I love the egg rolls too.  The owner is a terrific guy and makes your dining experience enjoyable.     I would recommend this restaurant anytime!"}
{"text":"Maybe we just didn't know what to order, but I think in general you can tell a decent Thai place by it's soup.   We ordered for the first time from Bangkok, and were extremely disappointed. The Tom Kha Soup was actually inedible. Pretty sure they used the wrong kind of coconut milk - they seem to have put the sweet kind in? It's either that, or they literally tossed in a cup of sugar. Either way, you can't eat the soup... it's cloyingly sweet. Yikes.   Also the crust on the angel wings was soggy and stale - the exact opposite of what it's supposed to be (we even took the time to order it crispy - that was compositely ignored).  They included a small container of white rice, but it was half empty on arrival! How chintzy can you get?   The only saving grace was the Phad Prig Sod - but beware: DO NOT order this extra spicy. You'll get a dish that is literally 2/3 jalapeno chunks. Once you pull out the majority of the jalapeno to achieve a standard ratio of meat to vegetable, the chicken and onions are pretty tasty. Too bad they don't give you enough rice to accompany it.  Overall, I have to say, stay away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times for lunch and dinner.  I am a real fan of their food.   The staff are always nice and usually willing to do substitutes within reason.  Now this place is in an older shopping center.  The inside is darker, but still lit decently.  It is usually quiet and peaceful.  Furniture is older, but they at least keep it clean and neat inside.  I like it, but your taste in decor may vary.    Only complaint is they don't deliver.  They do offer a company that delivers for them, but they are expensive."}
{"text":"Real Lao food, a freaking real Lao restaurant! The flavors are real, don't let the names fool you. I honestly hope more people check this place out to experience a different culture that has such rich food."}
{"text":"I've received takeout from here twice, ordering from door dash. The food overall has nice flavors but not enough spice to it. That's something that I solemnly would say, but I feel that most Thai restaurants throughout the Valley have a little spice to give it extra flavor. However, it was take out so I don't know if in store they have some fresh chili. The Pad woon Sen and Pad see ew are two favorite that I have received along with their fried rice! The only thing I'm personally not a fan of there, is the fresh spring rolls. It has an overwhelming flavor of basil, it blocks the flavors of everything else. Overall, not bad but not the best Thai restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"I have lived and traveled all over the world and currently live in Hawaii where Thai food is great; Bangkok Thai serves excellent Thai food at excellent prices. I travel through Az every three months and stop by every time. They serve high quality food at great prices. If you love curry this is the place to eat. The quality of spices and vegetables are generous. Lunch specials at $6.99 are inviting for those who have not tried Thai food yet. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Been a regular here...Food is good  ...Lunch menu is quite cheap but quantity was bit less !"}
{"text":"I wish there was a -5 star on the review since there isnt I guess I have no choice but to put 1 star.  My co-worker and I wanted Thai food and since the one I used to go to closed I figured try another Thai restaurant.  We came across this restaurant on google and had pretty good reviews so we tried it.  WHAT A HUGE FAIL!  I ordered the BBQ Chicken since the name of the restaurant has BBQ I figured, how can they mess that up?  I asked if instead of white rice can I substitute for a shrimp fried rice and I'll pay the difference and the other waiter said ok then the short guy comes over and confused the whole thing from one lunch menu to an entree to 2 entrees I said forget it just do the lunch special BBQ Chicken with white rice to make it simple.    Order came, my chicken was overdone, burnt on the outside and super dry on the insite.  I tried to eat some of it but I can't even chew the darn thing.  The soup tasted like chicken broth out of a can, the eggroll had no taste.  To top it all off, after letting him know about how dry the chicken is, he had the nerve to say \"it's usually pretty good maybe next time order shrimp fried rice\".  I wanted to tell him that your name has BBQ in it which normally means you specialize in that.  The total bill was about $28 then you have to add tax it was expensive and rip off.  Don't even go to this place if you wanted to decent food for a good price. TRUST ME.  What an awful experience, I ended up stopping at Starbucks got me an iced caramel machiato grande and a cake.  That was so much better than having to eat burned and dried food.    Oh and if the guy that served us is reading this, you should've at least offered to have given us a discount.  I'll make sure to spread the word about that restaurant around the company I work for and perhaps I could've save them grief."}
{"text":"In the words of Kuzco: BOOM BABY!   I was in the area for a doctor's appointment and had some time to burn. Did a quick Yelp search and settled on Bangkok.   Location/Ambiance: -strip mall restaurant. Do not let the outside fool you. The inside is well decorated and clean. -plenty of parking -modern simplistic decoration -steady customer flow during lunch -nice quiet atmosphere with a single TV  Service: -one employee (male) who was the host, waiter, and to-go order waiter. He was very quick and efficient without losing his polite and friendly attitude.  -lunch time service took less than 5 minutes to receive appetizers and less than 10 minutes to receive entree (from time of order).  Food: -lunch and dinner orders come with complimentary soup of the day and a veggie spring roll with dipping sauce. The soup of the day was a variation on Khao Tom (chicken and rice soup, broth based with scallions and cilantro); it was easily the most simple and perfect replication of my Thai mother's homecooked dish (which was more broth-based than coconut milk based). The veggie spring roll was a little limp and served at room temperature, but had good flavor. The dipping sauce was excellent. I 'd recommend getting a dinner/lunch combo just for these freebies. -I ordered the lunch portion of the yellow curry with chicken (Kaeng Kari Gai). I asked for it \"hot\" and it was the perfect amount of heat: enough to make me say \"wow\" but not enough to make it inedible. Just right! Also had excellent flavor. Served with an appropriate amount of rice. -fiance ordered his standard Massaman curry with pork, also hot, but the dinner portion. He was able to eat about half of the dinner portion, with leftovers for later. He, too, was very impressed with the flavor and heat.  Price: -here's the best part: lunch for two (with complimentary starters) for under $20 (actually, about $17). With enough for leftovers.   I hope I get back to Bangkok Thai BBQ ASAP. Excellent service, perfectly authentic Khao Tom, and exacting execution of flavor and heat in the curry. Cue drool."}
{"text":"It's OK. Most likely won't return. The food was ok, definitely have had better. The service was pleasant. The Thai tea boba was good, the boba was slightly hard. Pad Thai had good flavor but not worth coming back. 6/10"}
{"text":"My parents have been coming here for years and recently I've been going with them every once in a while. Every time I come here it feels sketchy because it's literally a whole in the wall and the booths are god awful. HOWEVER...the food is AMAZING! Seriously you wouldn't expect it but it's some of the best! And the prices are so affordable! I live downtown Phoenix and I'm around a lot of great restaurants yet I will now be driving the 20+ min it takes to get there for their coconut soup! Best ever!"}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall restaurant. Prices were good and the portions were fairly large. We order three dishes to feed four people and still had some left overs. We ordered the chicken with peanut sauce, the red curry and the pad Thai all three were great. Our favorite was the pad Thai with chicken. As far as spice goes order at least the medium because their mild has barely no heat. Their restaurant was cute not too loud pretty intimate. Service was great. Will be going out to check out their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Queen's Fried Rice, pad Thai, beef soup, and massaman curry were all excellent.  Service was friendly.  Highly recommend - we will definitely come again whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"What a gem! The chef makes the best homemade pot stickers and all of the food is just very, very tasty! I went here on a Tuesday evening with my husband and we were the only guests (since we arrived for an early dinner. The restaurant seems to be family owned and the waitress is also the prep cook. The shared with us that she preps all of the food and has two helpers in the kitchen. Real homemade food and you can definitely taste the love."}
{"text":"Horrible delivery service! I tried to order a combo meal for lunch today for obviously only 1 person and the lady told me i had to order at least 25$ worth of food PLUS a 5.99 fee just so they could deliver my food to me! Who does that??! haha Never again"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! I haven't had an egg roll in years but they do traditional Thai and use rice wrappers for theirs! And the pot stickers as well are rice wrapped! Sweet basil is delicious, I've had the spicy noodles with out soy sauce, bamboo shoot dish is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"This place has incredible Thai food!!!!!!  The only reason I dock this place a star is because when I stopped to pickup my take out the lady kept my change as her \"TIP\", ALL $9 OF IT!!!!!!. Who does that !?!? Yes I should of asked for it back, but the balls on this woman I figure she must really need it!  Anyway the food is a must on flavor. The green curry is some of the best I have ever tasted. The Tom Kah was a tad greasy but so delish, and the pad thai was actually light and pleasant compared to most places where it is super over whelming.  I will return to Bangkok Thai Bar-B-Q time and time again for delicious what Thai is supposed to taste like food. I am super duper impressed."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! It was empty when we went it, but most Thai places are around 8:00 pm. The server was really nice and gave good service. We got the spicy basil dish and the sweet and sour chicken. The spicy basil was amazing!!! You could actually taste the basil! It was delicious! On the downside, we got it at \"medium\" spicy level and it was just way too spicy. The sweet and sour chicken was ok. It could have been better. It wasn't very sweet, it was more sour. So I got a side of the sweet sauce and that made it better.   This place is close by asu so that's a plus too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away. The lunch prices are very affordable! I got the Panang Curry and he got the Pad Thai.   The lunch comes with a spring roll and cup of soup. The soup was ok but the spring roll was fresh and delicious. My Panang curry was amazing! I got it very mild and it still had a slight spice which is exactly how I like it. The Pad Thai seemed a little bland to me but my fiancé preferred it to others that he has had that had a little more sauce.   It is off the beaten path and tucked away in a complex but if you like Thai food I would recommend seeking it out and giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"This place is so good.   The food is always fresh and taste delicious.   We stick with the spicy noodles, pad Thai, and pineapple fried rice every time. We love it!  Great price and food! Yum"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and they delivered it with half the contents/sauce leaked out of containers.  Order 2 sweet and sour chicken and it came with NO chicken! $50 waste of money."}
{"text":"Fresh rolls are thee bomb they are literally fresh I am going to come back here most def I work across the street and happen to see this place when I parked in the lot to talk on phone ..and wondered if it is good as I love Thai food mmmmmmm ..so guess what I'm here I'm also trying the green curry (vegetarian) I'll check back in to update this. Pretty quiet place was one other person when I arrived he soon left after .waitress is super nice ..did I mention the fresh rolls vegetarian style  are bomb mmmm lol  Had the green curry and wowwww super good I am vegetarian so I had it with the tofu and it is excellent something gave it texture so that I swear it was meat but low and behold there was none  -I tripled checked lol-  Can't wait till I go back I recommend the fresh rolls and the green curry all vegetarian style mmmmmmmmmm until next time"}
{"text":"I read a few good reviews about this place and decided to take a few friends here.  I'm definitely a positive person, but I've never had such a bad experience. It took about 15mins for the food to come and we were the only ones there. I thought the food would be really fresh, but it felt like the food was made days ago and microwaved.  I also asked for separate checks and the waiter was rude. It really surprised me. That night my friend said that she started throwing up. I know it seems extreme, but this did happen. I am very disappointed and I will not come here again. I would give this place zero stars, but I have to give at least one."}
{"text":"The pineapple chicken curry was pretty good at a reasonable price.  I was disappointed that all of the other curries incorporate the exact same vegetables (including a poisonous plant called \"zucchini\"), but the pineapple curry uses a different mix.  The vegetables DID seem like they had been frozen, and there were no fresh herbs, so that's why I didn't give them the fifth star.  The punctuality, price, quantity and quality of meat, and overall flavor were quite favorable.    Also, I always order Thai food EXTRA MILD, and they actually got this one right.  Plenty of flavor, but no pain :)"}
{"text":"Grabbed a take out order of green papaya salad.  It's so good!  Like julianned cucumbers with a bit of heat that seems to cool you down at the same time.   Made fresh and. really good.  I was a bit surprised at the $9 price tag for the portion size.  It scratched that craving for the night."}
{"text":"Do you like dry, bland food? Well then, you've come to the right place!   First off, I don't know how they stay in business. Several other reviewers said the place was dead. Sure enough, my roommate and I were the only customers in the place.   We were tended to pretty promptly, which was nice. The Thai iced tea was good, but that's not saying much since it comes from a pre made mix. The water had a weird, chemical, metallic taste to it, probably because it's unfiltered.   The pot stickers we ordered tasted like they came from the freezer, as in pre-made. Nothing spectacular. I ordered the BBQ chicken. It had very little flavor and was dry to the point of almost being jerky. When I called this to the attention of the waitress, she offered me 10% off the bill. What?? You serve me DRY, tasteless chicken that I can't eat and you don't comp the meal??  I tried my roommate's dish, some type of beef concoction with ginger, and the beef was over cooked and rubbery. Yuck!   There was very little to like about this place and we won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Since my last review 5 years ago, we've been back maybe a dozen times between sit-down eating and ordering to-go.  Food has been consistently delicious and satisfying.  My gripe is that there is a clear difference in the amount of food you get when you order lunch for sit down and to-go.  Sit down lunch will leave you full while the to-go order will leave you still hungry.   On the lunch menu, it describes the dishes will include rice, an egg roll, and soup.  This is true if you sit down to eat.  When ordering to-go, you will only receive the entrée and egg roll.  I thought it was a one time fluke when I first ordered to-go but it has been this way for every to-go order I've done.  My advice is to come here for a sit-down meal to get the most value.  If you want to order lunch to-go, be sure to order extra food so you don't leave hungry.  I may just start ordering the dinner size for lunch as it's not much more expensive."}
{"text":"I love this place it's so good. I asked for Thai spicy and it is blow your mind hot. So good I don't know why it's not extremely busy it should be!!! :) happy holidaze"}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Old disgusting furniture. Horrible old food. The shrimp that came with the Tom yum soup tasted old. Also they didn't have any pickled chili condiments to help mask the terrible food."}
{"text":"Best fried rice around! And the spicy fried rice is excellent too! It's a must go to place here!"}
{"text":"To start with they had many drink choices on the menu and actually only had plum wine and regular kirin. Not a good start. Our order was taken and they didn't even ask what heat level we wanted.  The food was mild and kinda boring but not horrible by any stretch. I doubt I'll go back. For being a 4 star rated place on yelp I was extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food So flavor able Great selection for your pallet  Grubhub delivery sucks 35 min late  Really....?"}
{"text":"Maybe 4 stars is a little high, I would probably give three and a half if I could.  I came here for lunch and the plac was totally empty.  It's next to a charter school so there might be some kids outside smoking.  I guess it used to be a Mexican restaurant, and you can kind of tell inside from the mirrored arches.  I had the chicken curry lunch special version.  Comes with soup and a spring roll.  The portion of chicken curry was small, but for a lunch special it's not a bad deal- I think around $6.  The food itself was tasty and the service was good.  My water was always refilled.  The \"atmosphere\" of this place leaves a lot to be desired, but maybe if they get some more customers then they could eventually move to a nicer location."}
{"text":"Our 4th visit. Food was as good as ever. For the quality of food it is surprising to find not too many patrons. We don't mind the quiet though."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Bangkok Thai on a weekday afternoon, the place was quiet and low key. As we walked in, the hostess was very friendly. My wife had the Mighty Masaman Curry, and I had the spicy cat fish recommended by another yelper. Both dishes were delicious. The curry sauce was thick, creamy, coconutty and flavorful it went well with the potatoes and chicken. The cat fish was awesome, I'm not sure what the batter it was fried in was but I loved the fact that it wasn't greasy flavored or textured. The sauce that went with the cat fish was kinda sweet and a bit spicy depending on the level of spiciness you choose. We had coconut ice cream with fried bananas in a wonton as our dessert and those were pretty good too."}
{"text":"I want here on a first date and the food was really good! I enjoyed my meal I got the Pad See Ew and my date really enjoyed his meal, it was some type of chicken curry dish. When we got there there was no one else in the restaurant, but the restaurant is decorated well and it has a very inviting environment. The service was good too, example; we never ran out of beverages (pet peeve of mine). On the subject of drinks, I really liked what ever brand/type of iced tea they service. Delicious!"}
{"text":"The more time I spend in Glendale, the more I appreciate its many delightful hole-in-the-wall places. Bangkok Thai is all that I could ask for in a neighborhood Thai restaurant. I shared a Tom Yum soup and green chicken curry with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. Next time I'll try the massaman curry--a Thai friend recommends it highly."}
{"text":"Pad Thai with chicken was tasty! Nice balance of sweet, sour and a bit of spice. Egg roll was cold in the middle. The staff were friendly and I would come back."}
{"text":"WOW!  I just had Bamboo Chicken from this place and it was fabulous!  More flavor than any food of this type than I've had in a long time.  I will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"We were on our way to Pullano's when we saw the \"Grand Opening\" of Bangkok. Last time we stopped here (year ago) we left early due to loss of appetite when a roach skittered up the wall and across the table. But that was then and this is now - new owner deserves a fresh start, right?  Upon entrance we were greeted by two friendly guys who promptly sat us and took our drink order. I asked about the new opening - apparently the old owners went back home, the new owner took over the restaurant and gave it a \"make-over\". It must have been on a major budget because the place is pretty cheesy looking. We ordered a couple Thai teas and mulled over the menu. We went with our typical fare Phad Thai, Red Curry Chicken, Thai egg rolls and Crispy Noodle appetizer.   We could have done without the apps - egg rolls were shredded cabbage and the crispy noodle was sickening sweet with a few pieces of fried pork, tofu and a shrimp. The Red Curry was tasty and the Phad Thai was okay but I do have to agree with the other reviewer that meat was sparce.   The gentleman that was attending to us was very grandfatherly and attentive and I saw both guys peeking over every once in a while checking to see if we were satisfied. I got the impression that they were just starting out and it may be a little bumpy the first few months until they get into the swing of things. I may give them a try again half a year or so out, but I will stick to Siam Thai when I am craving really good Thai food and ambiance. All in all it was an okay meal nothing spectacular but I hope they succeed in the end - hate to see little mom and pops fail."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love bangkok thai. Although they're a little difficult to find, it is worth the trip every time. We normally dine-in and are always treated very well by the gentlemen that work in the front and our food is always good. This is easily our favorite thai place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If you like you like a good flavored curry come here. Just the right amount of coconut milk and level of spice requested. This is the only thai place within the Phoenix area that leaves me satisfied. I've eaten at a lot of Thai places in the country - trust me   Didn't eat at the restaurant, had my food delivered so I can't comment much on the service or the restaurant, but I rate on the taste!"}
