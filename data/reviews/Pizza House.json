{"text":"Simply the best pizza around PERIOD!  You just can't beat the price. Only downside is size of place. If it's busy and raining, you may find yourself outside waiting to get in."}
{"text":"They have a lot of options other than pizza, but I usually go with one of their specialty pizzas. You can tell everything is homemade and not like a chain restaurant. The only thing is I like my pizza to drip with sauce, so if you like more sauce than the average person ask for more!"}
{"text":"Tasty square-style pizza by the slice, couple of benches inside that you can sit on but more of a take-out place."}
{"text":"I'm from California & I have never been to a pizza place like this before! It is probably the best pizza I have ever had! The guys that work in there are very nice too!"}
{"text":"Was really expecting to have something different and fresh and I can easily say I was very disappointed. The cheese was undercooked, to the point where when my boyfriend brought it home we had to put it in the toaster oven. First bite and all I could taste was salt. Thought Hawaiian pizza would be more flavourful.  My boyfriend seemed to kind of enjoy it. But we both agree we will not be ordering from this place again. There is nothing \"Italian\" about it."}
{"text":"Love this pizza! Extra cheese unmelted! Just ask for it and you can't go wrong. Ambridge, PA is blessed with two of the best pizza shops in the country (Frank's Pizza and Pizza House AKA Police Station Pizza). I know that's a bold statement, but anyone that's been to both can not doubt agree with my statement."}
{"text":"Such a unique place!  \"Police Station Pizza\", as we locals know it, is amazing.  Great pizza, awesome customer interaction and usually a short wait.  Calling ahead isn't necessary and is somewhat pointless unless you want unbaked pizza.  You go in, tell them the number of slices you want, pay, they will ask toppings, pizza comes out of the oven, cold toppings go on and bake on the ride home.  How the guys in there keep track of what everyone wants (number of slices and toppings) is incredible."}
{"text":"Finally made it here.  When you walk in, you'll be asked, \"How many?\"  That means how many squares of this delicious Sicilian pizza.  Then you pick a topping for each slice. Eg:  \"Eight. Four pepperoni, two peppers two with extra unmelted cheese.\"  That's right. I said \"unmelted cheese.\"    As a native New Yorker, I tend to be a pizza snob. I found Pittsburgh sorely lacking in decent pizza.   This place, however, is quite good.    This place is a bit run down but in all of the best ways. No seats, no tables; just a large room in front of the counter where everyone is anxiously waiting for his or her pizza."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick slice before a movie. There were better options in the area but I thought this would be the fastest. Should have trusted my instincts and avoided this place. Bad 80s style slices with thick crusts and tasteless sauce and cheese. It's amazing to me that so many people can't make pizza but put themselves forward as professional pizza chefs. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This is one of those bucket list pizza joints. You will never be the only customer ordering. You get to view the whole process while you wait. It's amazing how they can remember exactly what toppings you ordered, quantity, and cost with out writing anything down. The style is a bit different than what you may be use to, and that's a good thing. The experience is A+."}
{"text":"A favorite among Ambridge natives. As a transplant, I too love it. The ordering system is weird (think the soup episode of Seinfeld) and you'll never understand it if you didn't grow up with it.   Basically, just go in, tell them how many actual squares of pizza you want, then 10 minutes later they'll ask you what each topping is for each square. They'll add it all up in their heads and give you a total. You pay in cash only.   No delivery and no ordering ahead. Like I said, it's weird but the experience is worth it. The rigmarole can get old if you don't appreciate the hoops but luckily the pizza is worth it.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Had to try this. Well school  cafeteria is what comes to mind.  The cheese is  imitation at best. It's not smooth or stringy.  The staff couldn't be more friendly and professional. Hats off to you guys.  Suggestion. Charge an extra fifty cents a slice and use real cheese."}
{"text":"It's the day before Thanksgiving and my family decided on pizza for dinner. What was my recommendation? Police Station Pizza, without question! This place offers superb takeout pizza in a modest, no-frills storefront. The service is basic at best but the pizza is absolutely to die for. Hands-down the best pizza in the area!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza, the best that I have every had.  I do not live in the area, but I was in town for the Dick's Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon yesterday and had to make the trip up to Ambridge to get some pizza from Pizza House, which is also informally known as \"Police Station Pizza\" since the police station used to be next door.  This pizza place has been here a very long time (since the 1950s), and they use the same recipes that they used when I was a child.  My grandparents lived in nearby Leetsdale, and we used to always get pizza from Pizza House whenever I visited them.  Everything about this place is the same as when I was a child, including the pizza itself, the order system, prices by the slice on the wall, and pizza served in white boxes. The prices have gone up with inflation, but they are still very reasonably priced.  On this visit I got some plain cheese and a pepperoni slices.  The pizza is very good, actually the best I have ever had in my life.  It is a square pizza with a very crispy bottom crust and a light and airy crust on top.  The pizza sauce is also very good, as is the cheese and pepperoni.  They put lots of cheese on it, and throw the toppings and some extra cheese on it after it comes out of the oven.  The pizza is a thick crust, kind of a cross between Sicilian style pizza served in New York City and Detroit style pizza, such as you can get at Jet's.  It is very good since they make the dough fresh daily and use high quality ingredients.  I bought a tray of the crust to take back home with me for $7.00 (of you can pay full price for the unbaked option that includes the sauce, cheese, and toppings).  The prices are very reasonable - $1.05 per cheese slice and 20 cents per topping and 25 cents for extra cheese (plus tax).  They only offer takeout pizza.  They also offer pepperoni rolls for $4.50, which they did not offer when I was a child.  They also sell bottled drinks.  The order system is very simple - you tell them how many slices you want, the toppings you want, whether you want it baked or unbaked, pay them in cash, and then wait patiently for your pizza to be ready (they have a couple of benches inside).  They are very friendly and are very efficient despite being very busy.  You can also call ahead.  I noticed that unbaked pizza orders were popular, as were full tray (24-slice) and half tray (12-slice) orders.  They are only open during the evenings, opening at 5:00 PM, and they do not take credit cards.  Note that they are closed on Sunday.  In summary, this is the best pizza I have ever had in my life, and that includes 3 trips to Italy and multiple trips to New York City and Chicago.  I highly recommend PIzza House, and if you live in PIttsburgh, it is definitely worth the trip up the Ohio River Boulevard.  I wish I could give them 10 stars, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Simply a a Beaver County institution.  I barely consider it pizza.  It is it's on entity entirely.   It's hard to describe but it's amazing.   The staff and the ordering process is 100% Ambridge.  If you are in the area I can recommend enough that you stop by and grab a slice."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever.  Has a great crunch.  Order by the slice or a tray.  Pizza only."}
{"text":"House of negative reviews for this place, minus the one star studded review at the bottom (wonder if the owner posted this) Big no no if you guys did!   Small Christmas lunch here at the dealership, ordered a 2 party pizzas: one with chicken, hot peppers and pineapple and the other was vegeterian with spinach, feta cheese and tomatoes.   Not wowed by this place, just okay. Could make much better pizza at home. If you want flavour, this ain't the place to get your pie from. The base of the pizza was soggy, sauce extremely bland, crust was like biting into a tastless piece of cardboard. Didn't have as bad of an experience as the previous reviewers."}
{"text":"What more can you say an Ambridge tradition. Been eating this pizza for as long as I can remember. Carry out only. Always packed but fast service you holler out your order when you walk in and somehow  the counter guy remembers it and the order in which it was placed the price pay and your on your way no paper involved. The old police station next door (a large white brick structure)  is office building now and a movie location for a Net Flix TV series sometimes it looks like you traveled back in time. And it reminds you why Original Pizza House got the nickname of Police Station Pizza."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza houses pizza it has been one of my favorites since I was a little girl and lived on church street in Ambridge down from Old Economy.  I normally get my slices with extra cheese and pepperoni, although I think I might just start getting it without extra cheese, there's so much cheese on there and it's unmelted sometimes so it can be a little much.  You can order a half sheet or a full sheet unbaked too along with the toppings.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Absolutely best pizza in Beaver county! Simply can't beat the prices,walk in wait time or freshness."}
{"text":"It was quite some time ago that I ate at this place, and I only ate there once, but I can say with confidence that it was by far the best pizza I have had in the greater Cleveland area.  This isn't saying much--pizza is one of the major weak-points of the city-on-the-lake.  What did I like about the pizza?  It was thinner-crust, the toppings were very fresh, it was flavorful, and not at all greasy.  Why do I refrain from five stars?  This place was quite expensive, quite a bit more so than I'd expect for pizza.  The problem is, you're in Cleveland, and you're competing with so much other good food...my advice is that if you're in Cleveland, you should just avoid pizza.  But if you really really want it, it's worth trying this place out."}
{"text":"Another great pizza option in the area. Pleasantly surprised they deliver to our area. Pizza was perfect and antipasti salad was fresh, tasty and large portion for 4(?) Will be back soon."}
{"text":"There's definitely a nostalgic attachment to Police Station Pizza, but to this day I can't come across a consistently better pizza anywhere. Police Station and Frank's are among the best pizza places in the entire metropolitan area, and better yet they are in the same town."}
{"text":"on par on price with pizza pizza but nowhere even close to goodness of pizza nova. cheese pizza was hours old to me and it was lunch time.  Environment: 0 / 5 Service: 3 / 5 Food: 1 / 5 Price Point: 1 / 5"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza every time!   So if you're new to this you'll want to walk in and wait to the left. You will be asked how many slices you would like (you can get however many you like). You can now move away from the entrance but I'd suggest trying to stay in one place if it's crowded so that they have an easier time keeping track of people. When your order is about to be finished (usually in about 5-10 minutes) they will ask what toppings. If you get extra cheese ask for unmelted, but be cautioned this is the most dense cheese pizza ever so don't plan on being able to eat the amount of slices you usually would. Their sausage is great - it's the crumbly kind!   This pizza is simple, square, crunchy, and delicious! You can easily feed 4 adults here for $20"}
{"text":"I feel for he hype and ordered from here. It's ok, I'm not impressed but they do get a lot of business."}
{"text":"Food - 1/5  Appearance - gross/5  Service - creepy/5    Food is alright. I can make better, more authentic, at home. I felt gross after I left. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the beaver county area ... I drove from Washington DC and knew my trip would not be complete unless I stopped and got me some squares."}
{"text":"Like I've stated in many reviews before. My wife and I are pizza snobs. We try pizza all over the place and have done so for nearly 25 years. This has been a long time favorite of mine. Nothing about this pizza is normal. From the way you order to the pizza itself. The crust is thick and crispy, excellent cheese and sauce. We always get pepperoni. My mouth is watering just think of this stuff."}
{"text":"Pizza House or \"Police Station Pizza\" is always great. Cheap prices, great crust and toppings are great (Pepperoni is really good) never really had any problem here. Can get really busy, don't bother calling, just go down order and wait. Wait is usually short anyways.  Square pizza, sauce then cold toppings go on. By the time you get home it's all melted together perfect.  Have only been to the Ambridge location so can't comment on other stores.  This and Franks are two of the best places around to get some great pizza!"}
{"text":"An original. A true classic. Crunch of the crust can't be beat. Get it with extra cheese unmelted: try to drive home without taking a bite."}
{"text":"Sadly, as of July 2015 they are no longer in business.   Being replaced by Wicked Taco."}
{"text":"Best pizza around by far i go here as much as i can i wish it was ok to eat pizza every day love how the cook the pizza the cheese is the best every one needs to go here once a week i know i do"}
{"text":"I have been going to 'Police Station Pizza' for 40 years. I have always enjoyed it!  Ordering experience can be somewhat different when crowded.  As soon you walk in, shout out the number of slices you are ordering. Then they eventually get around to you.  Doesn't take that long."}
{"text":"I just got through eating the worst panzo of my life.  No toppings, all bread, unmelted cheese.    I would have preferred to have ordered from the original Pizza House, located in Oak Ridges.  DO NOT BE FOOLED!!!!"}
{"text":"grew up eating police station pizza!!!  extra cheese is the bomb....everyone knows everyone and its friendly and the pizza is delish...didnt make me feel like shit!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great and pretty cheap as well. They have it ready like 5 minutes after you order. Carry out only. Just wish they were open on Sundays and earlier on Saturdays as I would have ordered there at those times before but had to go elsewhere because they weren't open."}
{"text":"The quality of the pizza is decent; in fact, if I were to only write a review for the food the rating for this restaurant would be 3-4 stars.  The customer service at this establishment leaves much to be desired.  I ordered a Mediterranean Pizza and gave specific instructions that I wanted no mozzarella cheese on half the pizza.  I made sure to be clear that I only didn't want mozzarella cheese.  When the pizza was delivered, I noticed that the half pizza with out mozzarella also had no feta.  I figured that this was an honest mistake and called up the store and let them know about the issue.  To my complete surprise the person I talked to was extremely rude and started yelling at me that this was a minor mistake and that he thought it was for dietary reasons.  He continued ranting and raving and was unprofessional in his interaction with me.  I feel that his reaction was unmerited and hurtful.  To resolve this issue, this person said that he would make a note of this. I am quite surprised at the lack of customer service. Whenever I have had a concern with an order placed from other pizza restaurants they have worked hard to solve the problem.  At least an effort to be respectful would have been appreciated."}
{"text":"Police Station Pizza is a great local favorite in Ambridge, Pennsylvania! No sitting - just take out. They make pizzas until they have made all that they have... You can get unbaked pizzas too. Price is great - fun to watch how they keep track of customer orders by just watching who has been standing awhile..."}
{"text":"This place really made my day! Called another place (Happy's) who really made me UNHAPPY. Good thing someone filled me in on Pizza House. Happy's, go back to whereever it is you come from, cause your product and service is just crap!! Thanks Pizza House!! You rock!!"}
{"text":"What more can I say that hasn't been said?  I am a third generation \"14th Street/Police Station/Pizza House\" patron & MUST have this when I'm in 'da burgh...which is maybe all that needs to be said???  Can't begin to describe the crust/sauce awesome-ness...just LOVE IT!!!  Rough & tumble in a GOOD way...one of the few things still holding on in Ambridge.  Props, again, to all staff who freakin' REMEMBER every.  single.  order.  Simply amazing.  Worth it to go & merely observe that phenomenon...well...almost...  ;)"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from here a few times since my last review; always perfect!   We also ordered some salad, pizza and stuff for a party from the catered menu and it was a hit.  We ordered the California veggie and a meat deluxe.  Salad was fresh.  Definitely my go-to pizza place now.  Staff is always super nice.   Suck it, Papa John's!  Lol :)"}
{"text":"Good local pizza shop. The staff was very nice. We got carry-out but it looks like it would be a fun place to stay and eat. Pizza is very cheesy, which I think is a good thing."}
{"text":"Police Station Pizza has always been my favorite growing up. The pizza is borderline deep dish and delicious, but the experience is what makes it truly unique.   Pizza here is exclusively takeout, so upon walking in the front door you are asked how much you want. Don't bother telling them anything besides how much because that's all they need to know at this point. They will ask what toppings when they need to know.  The guys always remember who ordered what and how many. I don't ever recall seeing a calculator or notepad, so these guys seem to be going exclusively by memory. My memory tells me they just kept money in a cigar box, but I may be romanticizing that part.  They are definitely still watching Pens games on the same TV on which they probably watched Lemieux's first game in 1984. The TV is in an important spot; facing the guys making the pizza, so don't get your hopes up about hanging out and watching too much.  Get the extra cheese unmelted. It'll be glorious when you get home."}
{"text":"Pretty bad pizza.  I do not recommend.   I gave them a try recently as they had a decent rating on Skipthedishes but I was quite disappointed.  Pizza did not taste good at all"}
{"text":"This place is f**** ridiculous. I get half my order and the delivery guy forgot the rest, by the time he gets it to me my pizza is cold and soggy. I call and ask to see if they can do anything as this was obviously there fault and they just tell me to \"put it in the oven for 2 minutes\" absolutely ridiculous  The delivery guy was kind and provided friendly customer support while the person who answered the phone was definetly uncooperative and unprofessional"}
{"text":"As a native of Aliquippa, I've grown up on Breezy's and Police Station pizza.  Police Station was always a stop when crossing the bridge to visit my cousins. As much as I wanted to see them and have play dates, I wanted the pizza more.  I'm spoiled from this goodness and have become quite the pizza snob indeed.  I live in Bloomfield but when the crave hits I'll hop in the car and head to Ambridge. My toppings of choice! Extra cheese, please!"}
