{"text":"I just moved to Carnegie and was looking for a good pizza joint. I put my order in for a chefs salad and fried mushrooms and after over an hour wait time I was less than excited about what I got. The mushrooms were SOAKING WET the first one I bit into had so much liquid I nearly choked. The salad when I first opened it was literally just cheese I poured on the dressing and shook it up and when I opened it back up it was 60% meat 30% cheese and 10% veggies. While most people wouldn't complain I was little upset having to throw away what felt like a pound of meat because there's no way any human can handle that much in one sitting. I can't comment on their pizzas or customer service as I ordered online, but from my single experience it's not something I plan on doing anytime soon. Maybe I'll try again in a few months if other places don't pan out."}
{"text":"Under new ownership so I thought I'd give them a shot. Tried to order using a coupon from their website, but they refused to honor what was offered on the coupon.     No apology or explanation, just a bad attitude. Not a great first impression."}
{"text":"So the food is pretty good, I'll give them that. But do they have to be so incredibly rude? Every single time I call, the person who answers the phone is an a**. Every time. They tell me 30 min, it's an hour ten. I keep trying to give this place another and another and another chance - cause the food IS good, but seriously? Good customer service goes a looong way, and this place just can't seem to figure that out."}
{"text":"I don't like this place at all. The staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business. A couple years ago I had heard they smoke over making their pizza. All of their employees tend to be shady. I don't recommend at all."}
{"text":"Got into Pittsburgh late this evening and this was the only place around that was still open and delivered after 11 pm. I give them a half star for this. 

They have a few vegetarian choices on the menu. I give them another half star for this. I ordered what I thought would have the most vegetables, the \"vegetable calzone.\" 

They ended up delivering a \"Mediterranean calzone,\" which was also vegetarian, but it wasn't what I ordered. The small portion of vegetables was tasty and most of them seemed fresh, so I give them another half star for this. I didn't bother to ask if anything was organic.

They told me it would be about a 45 minute wait, but it ended up being closer to 30 and the delivery guy was friendly. I give them another half star for under-promising and over-delivering. 

This place might be great for people who love fresh made bread and lots of cheese, but it's not a vegan delight!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the problem is ordering on weekends. I hope this was a fluke. It is midday Sunday on a non football day. They said 45 mins I called them back to check status as I knew it was close to an hour. Guy on phone was snippy says why are you calling (after I tell him I am calling to check on order) it has only been 52 minutes! Food arrives shortly after and fries are cold and soggy. lettuce in the salad was limp....

I wrote the above 3/17 and forgot to post.

I gave the another chance and had 3 good experiences in a row. And then...last time I got the large greek salad with well done steak fries. Well that is what I ordered. what I got were barely done fries and a salad with 1tsp of feta cheese, (most of the time the feta portion is generous)

time to find a new place for delivery"}
{"text":"I had the Garlic and Spinach and the Vegetable. The dough was fresh. But the taste of the pizzas was just adequate, nothing special. I preferred the Garlic and Spinach over the Vegetable."}
{"text":"Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too."}
{"text":"So it was late on Ozzfest Eve, and we needed sustenance. It's almost 10:30 PM? Who delivers at that hour? We tried calling different pizzerias to no avail. Busy signals galore! What are we gonna do?!?

Little Nippers comes to the rescue like good old Jim Dandy.

Go Lil Nippers, go Lil Nippers!

We got a small round pizza with get this (blame the ladyfriend) bacon, black olives, and...pineapple?

It was a combo that worked famously, especially when you factor in a triumphant sauce, cheese that was almost gummy without being rubbery, and a crust puffier than Glenn Beck sans the obnoxious worldview. 

I hadn't ordered breadsticks in a while and thus had forgotten how yummy they can be. They had a real bakery quality to them and were so tastebud-pleasing, they disappeared faster than \"Cop Rock\". 

Someone, SOMEONE knows how to do an Italian Hoagie up right.  The bread tasted as if it was freshly baked as opposed to being baked into concrete. Flawless. The veggies tasted as if they had been cut to order, the dressing was spicy and tangy as one of the Italian type should be, and the meat was actually generous, so generous in fact that ya felt the Catholic guilt. Well, I did anyways. 

Man, was it a good thing that we just happened to be in their delivery area the other night. 

Little Nippers made me...chipper?

Ok I'll knock it off."}
{"text":"An impromptu party/picnic in the yard.   Lots of kids and friends stopped by to see an old neighbor that was in town visiting.  All of a sudden, it was time to eat.  Little Nipper's to the rescue.   Ordered a few different style pizza's and some wings.  Nice crust not thin but not to thick, the sauce is tasty, cheese was nice... gummy, stringy, good.  The pizza's disappeared fast.  The wings were good and a little crunchy, just right."}
{"text":"We know it sounds crazy but this place has seriously upped its game. This used to be our go-to place when we were drunk and the other better pizza places had closed and we were at the \"anything tastes good when you're lit\" stage. But tonight we decided to relive old times and this time...the pizza was legitimately good. Like really good. Like delicious savory sauce that made Giovanni's and Nicks and other local places seem very unimpressive, a flavorful cheese blend that was melty without being crusty, and a solid crust. If they worked on their crust, they would be closer to the Apizza Badamo level, but the doughy, cheese-bread-y crust isn't quite there yet. 

We don't know if this place is under new management, having a rare exceptional night, or what...but this pizza was a  delicious, quickly delivered midnight treat, and we will be back soon."}
