{"text":"I am so happy to have eaten here. My stomach and mouth have joined forces to write a thank you letter to the chef. It reads: Dear Chef, thank you for the oysters. They were decadent. Superb. Lovely. Coupled with my white wine, I was happy and  fulfilled. Then, chef, you introduced me to halloumi. Halloumi and its soulmate, eggplant. I never knew... I knew to eat these things separately... but together... together is something dreams are made of. Next, quail and beet salad. Both of these dishes were delights, although my heart lives with halloumi and his wife aubergine henceforth. But these were just the appetizers!! The main was the wall-eye. I grew up near the water and have caught these bad boys myself. I've had my share of wall-eye and this wall-eye was delicious! Cooked just right and served to please. You make a cottage country girl proud. Lastly, the cheese platter. I have never seen such a beautiful wooden dolly full of cheeses from Quebec and beautiful accompaniments - apricot marmalade with mustard seed to name just one! This cheese. So good. 

The ambience in this place is lovely - wooden touches and teal painted walls. A lovely spot on rue Bernard tucked next to Cheskie's. Warm. That middle ground between charming and elegant. Bring your friends here :) It is such a wonderful addition to this street!"}
{"text":"Decor and atmosphere are great, but the food! Omg the food...

One of the best places to eat in Montreal if you're looking for a tasty, creative menu. 

Went for date night with the wife and sat at the bar (our favorite) - ate unbelievable stuff. Gnocchi with lardon, duck confit, croquettas (a must try) and FRIED OREOS FOR DESERT?! WHAT?!?!

Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Great atmosphere. The food and wine were a revelation but the highlight of the night was definitely the luxurious cheese plate. I would go back just for the cheese selection! 

My only complaint is that the prices were on the steep side."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night, I went to dinner with my 14 year old and treated him to a nice evening out. The place was a little empty, but it had a nice vibe.  Love the color and vintage styling of the restaurant. The cocktail I started with was nice (Mexican Cartel?) And the little mushroom balls were outstanding and delicious. My son ordered the pork chop and I had the Seafood paella (but on pasta)  The seafood paella was amazing. I will go back just for this. My son really liked the pork chop.  It was very hearty and nicely prepared. We skipped dessert.  Ok, its a little pricey, but the food was great and I had a nice one on one with my little guy.  Its not exactly kid friendly in terms of portions/price but my son enjoyed it nonetheless. I will go back again."}
{"text":"Went to Anabel last week and was pleasantly surprised. I liked the atmosphere and the food was delicious. We had a nice bottle of wine and enjoyed the experience. Although Anabel is a little pricy, I think you get what you pay for. Next time I will pass on the deep-fried Oreos - a bit too much for my taste."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time during poutine week and for our wedding anniversary to boot.
And that was a great idea.
I will never forget that poutine, holy f*ck balls was it ever tasty.
(Pretty please put it on your menu)
Hell, all the food was.
And the cheese, oh my god the cheese.
I definitely recommend this place.
We had a great evening with amazing food."}
{"text":"I never leave here unsatisfied. The service us excellent,  the food is delicious. I love the new menu!"}
{"text":"I came and swooned and consumed and thought How Beautiful and Comfortable! And how Chalereux the service! So easy going, smart and comfortable! Such a beautiful well-appointed cozy room painted a warm green with bright white moldings like you find in all our old apartments here, and thick vintage wooden tables and buffets.

And the food. The food. The food. The PEI and Nove Scotia oysters were so sweet and fresh and amazing and the mignonette was classic and perfect. The grilled buttery halloumi is my new favourite food and I loved the beet salad with goat cheese as well. The quail was very tasty but warning for the vegetarians and the faint of heart, this comes with claws and face. Freaked me, for one. 

I loved the dry Greek white wine our charming waiter suggested and just the whole smart easy going feeling here. And the beautiful cheese cart that puts all dessert carts to shame in my heart with its gooey savoury goodness pushed me over the edge to 5 stars. I'll be back for sure, beautiful new option in the neighbourhood for dining with wise friends and loved ones. Apps were around $12, mains around $25, wine and cocktails in the $10-$15 range."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to have 1$ oysters on a Thursday night and saw this place listed on mtlblog's 'best cheap oysters' list. Needless to say, thank you mtlblog! 
Very decent and fresh oysters for ridiculously cheap, especially for a Thursday. 
But the oysters weren't even the best part, the service was stellar and the mains were outstanding. 
We had the gnocchi's with lard and peas as well as the seared halibut.
The gnocchi's were out of this world, boiled then slightly seared to give it a bit more texture and the lard added just the right amount of smokiness. Definitely more of a winter dish but I'll have gnocchi's like that any season :) 
The halibut was also very nice too, crispy skin, pleasantly meaty cut. Only downside is that the sauce it came with could have used more seasoning.
My only other critic is that the full wine by the glass could have gotten a more generous pour. We didn't see much of a difference between the 1/2 pour and the full one. 
So word of advice, get the 1/2 pour to save some money and try more wines :)"}
{"text":"We decided to check out Anabel for Poutine Week 2015 (it didn't hurt that we heard Anabel served deep fried oreos on their dessert menu). 

Nestled in the trendy Mile-End just off of Parc, Anabel's dining room is quaint and cozy. The walls are painted in aqua and the massive mirrors serve as a canvas for their daily specials. 

We shared the poutine special (fries with cheese curds, roasted cherry tomatoes, turkey confit, chicken skin and mornay sauce). The mornay sauce was unbelievable, providing that extra cheesy goodness beyond your average poutine. The turkey on top was also really tender and the tomatoes gave a fresh bite to the dish. The chicken skin... Need I say more? 

We also shared the duck confit that came with a stuffing waffle, gravy, steamed green beans and roasted eggplants.  The duck itself was perfectly cooked with a crispy skin. In my opinion, the gravy was a touch too salty. The quantity of it was perfect so that you could have some in every bite but it was quite overwhelming by the end. 

To finish we shared the deep fried oreos. While the restaurant gets bonus points for putting the vanilla ice cream on the side (to avoid ice cream soup), the batter was too tense and doughy for the Oreo. 

On the whole, the vibes and the service of the restaurant gets full points. For the food, we would need to try more items on the menu to get a better idea. Still worth a visit!"}
