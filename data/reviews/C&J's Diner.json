{"text":"Driven past diner for years, finally decided to stop in. Breakfast was very good, friendly and fast service. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came in and sign says wait be to seated, so we waited, and waited and waited until someone sat us. Food was very good. I had a skillet and my friend had steak and eggs. Honestly only complaint is service. Theresa (I heard other people say her name since she never told us) was so rude. She made comments to other guests about the other employees that she worked with and I felt embarrassed for them. Also anytime she brought something I would say thank you and she would just walk away. What is the point of making a customer feel like they are an inconvenience?! If she had smiled one time that would of went a long way..."}

{"text":"This is the old Jimmy's restaurant re-opened as C&J's (the owners of the building). From the outside, not impressive. Not the kind of place you would go to try and impress someone. But, you're looking for a breakfast, right? :)

Breakfast and lunch served. Food is good. Usual fair for breakfast. Never been for lunch. Most breakfast meals under $5. Right now they offer free coffee from 7-8am M-F.  My breakfast this morning was two eggs, 3 strips of bacon, two large pancakes and coffee. $4.39. Can't beat that.

The food is tasty but nothing extraordinary. Service is fast. The decor is very bland, but seems clean. At one time, this place must have been a bar and grill. I have been there several times and have no complaints."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. We came for breakfast and me and my three kiddies all had their steak and eggs. Mine was fine but the kids were all raw. W had asked them for medium rare but they were really under done. The server took them back right away and made them medium, by request. The quality was pretty impressive for such a quaint little place. And the portions were great too!"}
