{"text":"food was good when we came the 3 or 4 times. We are new to the area and looking for good places to eat. I enjoyed the grilled chicken salad but they need to add more to the menu. Especially healthy options and non beef or pork. It seems like the menu is always the same. MORE choices and I will be back"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the food is consistently tasty and fresh.  I had the Pub burger with beer cheese and grilled onions & mushrooms on a pretzel bun and it was delicious.  My husband had the Tuscan wrap and it was also great!  He started with the chili and all the toppings.  Another winner!  The wait staff have been friendly and attentive.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Same ol' same ol' tired menu items, only difference is they are overpriced. Service is slow unless you are a single man sitting at the bar-they seem to get taken care of quickly. My husband and I sat and waited and waited for our waitress to refill my soda and to get hubby another beer. When she finally came we decided to only get the bill and split. Won't go back there. Live and learn."}
