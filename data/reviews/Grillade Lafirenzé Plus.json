{"text":"The food is really good and tasty. Tried the BBQ Chicken and the goat, the former was excellent, the latter was good except the meat was not very tender.
If you love spicy food, you'll be in for your money with their hot sauce. You will have to be a little patient though... Suggest calling and ordering in advance."}
{"text":"Amazing food but expensive the taste is amazing tho like juicy goat  and that pretty much it"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in all of Quebec for roasted goat.  It's a shame it's not open regularly enough as I can only come by chance. Calling ahead doesn't work as some Sundays they are not open at all.  Why?

Lately the goat has been more bone and fat which is terrifying because I don't want to lose my favorite place! Lol it's too good.

I give 5 stars for quality of excellent staple Congolese foods, but 1 star for reliability!"}
{"text":"Saturday night and me and my girl are contemplating which restaurant to dine in she chooses La Belle et La Boeuf and I decide for us to try out a Congolaise restaurant that a classmate mentioned to me(boy do I regret not opting for La Belle et La Boeuf) so we enter the restaurant and we are seated, after about 8 minutes we're wondering when our menu is coming and we literally had to get up and ask for it which is sad, the demeanor of the staff was off putting and not friendly. One particular incident that stands out is a gentleman over hears me and my girl speaking english and he mentions to her he likes speaking french and despises speaking english.

Right then and there we should of just left the restaurant, that was an ignorant statement and counter productive of trying to gain more customers instead of your loyal Congolaise group of 30 or whatever you could gain more and grow your establishment but the ignorance will keep them from expanding. I will never go there again nor would I promote or recommend any anglophone to go there since they clearly showed they only want Congolaise people only or other french speaking African's.

I do not foresee this restaurant lasting much longer and will have no pity or remorse maybe there next go around they will try and educate themselves on being more inviting and not close minded such a shame since the food although not mind blowingly fantastic it was ok and the portion size as well."}
{"text":"this place was very dissapointing, the costumer service was extremly bad, rude remarks on one of the employees part all cause we spoke english, mind you i am bilingual but i never been to a place where we were told we had to speak french especialy everyone there was speaking in there native toungue, were they serious come on now,if they ever try to build and expand it won't be with that atittude, the food took forever and very expensive, for the taste it was ok!"}
