{"text":"I've been once. We wanted to love it. We did not.  There was no line at all but our order took over 15 minutes (we got cookie dough cones). I really can't figure out what took so long.  These are not cheap treats which would be fine except they aren't tasty either. Literally only good for a photo op as they are presented beautifully. No one could finish theirs as they made us nauseated and had the consistency of play dough. Some tasted fine. Others were gross. None were great.  Staff was pleasant enough... I MAY come and try something else but will definitely not go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Only tried their deep dish pizza which was pretty good surprisingly! Love how it is personal pizza size but one could probably be shared amongst two people. I preferred the Hawaiian one more because it had less tomato sauce / ketchup."}
{"text":"Pros: Good location along a busy street of restaurants and businesses. Pretty good marketing to get you in the door.   Cons: Limited menu items for a restaurant premise of offering junk food (the possibilities of which are endless), service could be improved (our server was quite brash). Food left much to be desired - tried the birthday waffle and found it to be cold and soggy. The cookie dough did not really taste like anything and was very overpowering - least favorite part of the dish.  Junked Food Co has done a splendid job marketing themselves to the city but all that hype has made it difficult for them to meet the expectations of their customers. I was disappointed in the dish I tried, and have spoken to other people who share my sentiments. And I really wanted to like this place.  Would I come back? Probably not, unless they come up with something new and exciting (and maybe involving churros)."}
{"text":"The cookiedough is delicious and thats about it. I tried the tater tot smash bag and my friend got the mac and cheese one. I won't be returning. It was gross. Pretty much exactly what it is advertised as, junk. If you're a stoner and want some munchies then you've come to the right place."}
{"text":"The menu looks great. The desserts... not so much. The service was great and that's why they deserve 3 stars. The employee working in the front was so patient to explain the top sellers and gave some pretty good suggestions!   However, I didn't know desserts came in portions so small! Really wasn't worth what I paid for.   If you do come here and have a sweet tooth, one portion probably won't be enough. Order two."}
{"text":"I had the birthday cake flavour. It definitely didn't taste as good as regular cookie dough, would suggest that one if you do want to try."}
{"text":"Came here to try their cookie dough ice cream - cookies and cream was sold out Thursday 4pm so I picked the cereal one. 1 scoop cup portion was big but cereal was soggy. I'd come back if a friend wanted to try it."}
{"text":"Tried the Smoreo, an Oreo waffle with toasted marshmallow fluff, chocolate chips, Oreos, chocolate drizzle and cookie dough in the center. It was good but very rich. Definitely a shareable dessert. I couldn't eat more than 2 sections of the waffle."}
{"text":"The staff was all very friendly and nice. We got the Mac and cheese fries and they were good. But the Whack Mac was so bland, it was in desperate need of some salt. Got the peanut butter cookie dough, it tasted good, but the texture was horrible. It was really slimy, the Reeses pieces were soft and the Reese puff cereal was very stale. Should probably be replaced.   Overall, I'm disappointed. I was looking forward to going and I'm never in that area and it just didn't live up to the hype at all."}
{"text":"Nice feel good food! I tried the personal size deep dish macaroni and cheese pizza (6\") and it was yums. The pizza dough was good, and the pulled pork and mac and cheese inside made for a nice filling.  I'd be interested in trying the other menu items here."}
{"text":"Went to their original location on Dundas , loved the quirkiness and the grab bags. Today tried their deep dish pizza and was actually overwhelmed how great it really was."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 2 stars because of the sweet cashier who helped us make our decisions. Other then that, do not waste your time here.   Me and my 2 friends came by on a Friday night. We were the only ones in there at the time. Dropped a cool $80 on food because we were starving and looking for a junk food binge.   We ordered 3 of their deep dish pizzas, the mac and cheese, the garlic mushroom and the polo loco. We got that Dorito thing, poutine, and their mac and cheese.   The mac & cheese pizza is so blah, the sauce tastes exactly like plain canned tomato sauce. So seasoning, not even salt. It's so bland.   But not as bland as the mac & cheese. I don't know how this is possible, me and my friends were so confused, but they managed to make it with no flavor. There is literally NO taste. We couldn't taste the macaroni or the cheese. It was so strange.   My pizza was so watery. My friend thought it must be the mushrooms, but I've had my fair share of mushroom pizza (it's practically the only kind of pizza I eat) & I've never encountered this.   The best thing we ordered was the poutine. It's so hard to mess up a poutine though. It was more like a poutine nacho.  The fries were crispy, a good lAyer of cheese sauce, olives, tomato, sour cream.   I will more than likely never come back."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to come here since all of the Instagram photos have been nothing but delicious looking. Unfortunately I was disappointed when I visited today. I ordered the cookie doh-nut (clever name) it sounded amazing, but when I received my order the waffle part was hard and didn't taste the greatest, almost as if that waffle has been sitting there all morning. The donut was very tasty and the cookie dough was good too. I think I was expecting more from it and unfortunately it fell short for $8. I hate to say this but I have had better, but I am happy I tried it. I am not sure I would go back. But the people there were extremely nice!"}
{"text":"During my last trip to the CNE, I stopped by the Junked Food Co truck for a late-night treat. Having heard excellent things about the restaurant and food truck, I was really looking forward to trying their food firsthand. I opted for the pb&j cookie dough with chunks of Reese's peanut butter cups and Swedish berry jelly sauce topping, but was incredibly underwhelmed. I did not enjoy it at all. I had some serious fomo from all the other food options I wish I could have tried instead. There are many other edible cookie dough options in Toronto, and I'd recommend going elsewhere"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place, as I heard a lot of buzz from my colleagues and Instagram.  Unfortunately, it seems this is another place that just relies on novelty, and doesn't care how the food tastes.    I had the Pulled Junk - pulled pork in a waffle.  Looks delicious on the photo, however in actuality, the waffle was soggy, and the pulled pork wasn't very flavourful.  Overall just felt like a microwaveable meal.  The ideas are interesting, I would suggest that they actually focus on making things taste good."}
{"text":"This gets a one star because there's nothing less. I got the Cookie dough scoop that was birthday cake or something flavored. Honestly it was so lack luster it tasted like food coloring. After one bite it was a whole lot of wasted money and regret. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Had their famous edible cookie dough. In my opinion is not worth the hype, way to sweet for one person. I had like to spoons of the dough and then threw it away. I would recommend it if you go with a group of friend which would like to try something different, not go with just one friend."}
{"text":"The cookie dough was delicious but it's way too much for just 1 person. Neither my friend nor I were able to eat more than a couple spoon fulls.  I would recommend you share one cup between 2+ people.  Cookie dough 5/5 Seating area 4.5/5 Costumer service 5/5"}
{"text":"I was extremely surprised by everything Junked Food Co offered.   While downtown Toronto for the day I was dying to try the new edible cookie dough trend and was excited when google told me that Junked Food co offered edible cookie dough.   The store was semi difficult to find and was not at all what I expected. I had expected more of a candy store with things on display and a more upbeat colourful vibe. The store was actually very dark with no decor or food/candy on display. Service was very fast and the cookie dough was decent. It was a little pricy for such a small dish of cookie dough but it was extremely filling so I wouldn't have wanted any more anyway.   My friend was really craving some ice cream which they do sell but not in the way we expected. The cookie dough is sold with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, they daily flavour or soft serve. When my friend asked for just ice cream , she was told that she could have a very tiny dish of soft serve. Needless to say she didn't get any.  While I would recommend it to someone who is looking for edible cookie dough downtown Toronto, I'm not sure I would go back myself."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared a bruschetta deep dish pizza. It was... an experience.   The bruschetta was only slightly above room temperature, with a puddle of (olive?) oil sitting on top. The crust was pretty good, but the bottom got soft too quickly.  The mac and cheese pizza might be less uh, WET, and for that reason I'd steer anyone reading this away from the bruschetta.   Def would not repurchase!"}
{"text":"Tbh I'd give this place a 3.5 instead of a 4 if it's an option, but I'd say it's worth trying.  This place actually makes effort to make their food fun and tasty at the same time, not saying the food there are Michelin level but they're definitely not bad, innovative, and instagramable. They're definitely targeting people who live the instagram worthy live since they even have light box and everything in the restaurant. They also have secret menus and seasonal dessert items that are totally adorable, might be too sweet for my liking, but super cute.  Here are some item's I've tried:  Meat Monster - Deep dish pizza for one, I had it fresh and it was absolutely amazing, can't go back to   Whack Mac - Mac and cheese, but with white chocolate melted with the sauce. My friend didn't like it but I thought it's quite unique and tastes pretty good, also it's not too cheesy so I didn't feel too guilty for the white chocolate  S'moreos - Waffle with obvious word combination. I can see some people liking it but it's too sweet and waaay too filling for me.  Pull Pork Sandwich - With waffle instead of bread, the waffle's kind of bland and it wasn't crispy but I guess if it's too sweet it'd taste too \"lousy\" with the pulled pork and pickles, and the textures work well together. Liked it, kind of need syrup though, I'm guessing?  Also tried this green chocolate mint flavoured cookie dough on St. Patrick's Day, I liked how it's actually minty and the lucky charms made the whole thing so festive, I don't think I have photos but I'm sure they're all on instagram somewhere."}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Service: N/A Value: 2 Presentation: 5 Overall: 3.7 rounded up to 4  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Today, I will be reviewing the meat monster deep dish pizza and the tacho smash bag. My girlfriend told me this place serves better deep dish than the one in Chicago but that seems pretty hard to beat because I really enjoyed Chicago deep dish. Anyway, let's dive right into the review.  We were given the taco smash bag first because the deep dish pizza takes approx 20 min to prepare. Tater tots were sprinkled on top of a layer of cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, with a final layer of Doritos underneath. It was jam packed with flavour while the crunchiness of the Doritos underneath complemented it very well. Although it tasted quite good, the bag wasn't very big and would make a good appetizer as opposed to an entree. Then the deep dish came. The crust was nicely cut and pepperoni on top was slightly crisped. I was a huge fan of the slices being pre-cut into equal sizes unlike some pizza places *cough cough pizza pizza*. As I pulled the first piece out, the strings of cheese stayed attached to the pizza. The crust was very crispy and while I really enjoyed the cheese and pepperoni, I felt like the pulled pork didn't fit well with the pizza.   Note that this is a self serve place. So the service rating is as good as how you're willing to serve yourself ;) (my girlfriend said I was an average server so she would have given me a 3, I beg to differ but I may be slightly biased). I have therefore decided that a service rating was N/A.  I feel like the smash bag was too small to warrant $8. The pizza on the other hand looks pretty small, but shouldn't be underestimated. The pizza is very filling for its size. For $13 it is slightly overpriced but will be more than enough to fill one person up.  Overall I really enjoyed my meal here. Is the deep dish better than Chicago's? No, I can't say that, but it was still very good overall. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life."}
{"text":"The owners are great guys and they know how to make some quality food. I LOVED the Reese's pieces cookie dough treat they gave me. The prices are good and the food is tasty. They have some very creative menu items that are worth trying!"}
{"text":"Thank God I don't live in Toronto because if I did, every time I drank or was hungry or walked by Junked Food, I'd be there and that would not be good, or would it?  Initially I wanted to go to Junked Food because I saw they had edible cookie dough which seems to be slowly sweeping North America. What's sad is that I didn't end up getting it, but I did get to try something.  Junked I feel like really knows who their customers are. The food is fun, simple, with cool names like, smash bags, birthday party (cookie scoop), and their Mac n cheeza pizza. They also have photo booths and mats set up to make it easy for you to Instagram your food which obviously helps their social media as well. You get likes, they get business. Win/win.  I ordered a smash bag first because I was hungry and would have felt bad if I had dessert first. I had totchos which was their smash bag with tator tots. The smash bag in addition to the tots comes with Doritos, Lettuce, tomato, onion, cheddar, olives, jalapeño, sour cream and chili sauce. It's kind of everything you want in a meal all inside of a Doritos bag.  I finished my bag and sadly I was stuff and never made it back for my dessert. I have to come back and give it a try. I saw so many people coming in and out with it and they all seemed to love it.  A smash bag is about $7 and honestly I was well worth it. It's nothing fancy, but it's a lot of fun and it's pretty filling. I'm definitely a fan and I'm pretty sure you'll be one too once you try it out."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Junked Food Co. on Queen Street W, west of Spadina Avenue.  I ordered a small double pep deep dish pizza.  There was supposed to be cracked black pepper on it but I asked that it not be added (it seemed like a weird ingredient to me).  What was added was parmigiana cheese, which I'm not a fan of, but there wasn't much.  I love love love pizza and this was a good pizza.  The sauce was nice and the pizza dough was surprisingly light.  I'd get it again.  One suggestion I would make is to get better knives and forks.  I ate it in and the plastic cutlery provided are really flimsy.  I ended up eating the pizza with my hands because it was hard to cut through the dough."}
{"text":"The Reese Lightning cookie dough scoop was pretty tasty. The peanut butter cookie dough was perfect--sweet, salty, and creamy. However, there were too many Reese's pieces and not nearly enough Reese's puffs (only *one* to be exact), which made it a little too sweet."}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends, including someone who has an anaphylactic allergy to soy protein. Given the use of prepackaged ingredients (I.e. the Doritos in the Smash Bags), he had a lot of questions and concerns. The girl behind the counter was so helpful and patient. We ended up ordering a couple of Smash Bags (one had to be adapted to accommodate the allergy), a Mac n Cheeza, Crack Mac, Cheese Fries, Fried Cookie Dough, Soft Serve topped with Cookie Dough, and the Smoreo Waffle. The unique options were a lot of fun and almost everything was delicious. The standouts were definitely the Smash Bags (we got the one with tater tots) and the Smoreo. The one thing holding me back from giving my experience 5 stars is the Crack Mac - the Mac n cheese made with Brie and white chocolate among the more savory ingredients. We got this thinking it would be different but honestly you don't taste the white chocolate at all because the dish is just too salty. Most of it got tossed. That and the portions can be a touch on the small side which is alright for a late night snack (this place would be amazing after a night of drinking) but not the best as your dinner. Also, this is basically a counter service restaurant which my friends and I did not realize prior to going and ended up awkwardly all sitting in a line and looking at the wall."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE service - do not go. We ordered two cookie dough cups. We waited 30 minutes. When we went back to check on our order - the cashier hadn't even put it through yet. She said that she would go work on it right away. I went back 10 minutes later, and she still hadn't started. So she gave us a refund and that was that. Waited 40 minutes and left without any cookie dough. :( Waste of time."}
{"text":"I tried the deep dish twice at this place. It is super delicious. The customer service is nice. I have nothing wrong to say about this place. Both the bruschetta and garlic mushroom worth trying them."}
{"text":"I didn't have a good experience here and I don't think I'll ever come back. The cookie dough icecream didn't taste fresh at all. And for anyone that thinks it's cookie dough icecream, it's not. It's literally cookie dough in a cup lol it was my first time having cookie dough and I was in complete shock cause it was warm and soggy. They also put an unnecessary amount of chocolate sauce and extra toppings. I couldn't even finish the whole cup and I spent almost $5 on it -.- Also, I went on a Sunday and the place was really dirty. None of the tables were clean and there were garbages on the floor."}
{"text":"The concept is cute, and besides having the \"instagrammable\" aspect to it, Junked is okay. They're obviously trying to make an effort at creating something fun and different that people can share on social media, but for the price, the taste isn't great. I got the chocolate chip cookie dough cone which was nice to look at, but it was around $7, and I could only have a few bites because it was too rich and heavy. I guess that means the portions are good, but not for the price. I definitely should've shared it with a friend instead of getting my own, but I also expected there to actually have ice cream in it (note - it doesnt...it's just straight up cookie dough)! I do want to try the \"smash bags\" - they look really good and are a cool concept."}
{"text":"Visited the Junked food truck during the CNE's Food Truck Frenzy. I saw one person with cookie dough and I simply had to find out where it came from. I ordered a scoop of the chocolate chip cookie dough for $5.   OH. MY. GOD. There are those certain foods in life that as you are eating them, you think to yourself \"this is so worth being fat for\". Don't tell my doctor about my dark thoughts!  In a crowd of at least 25 food trucks, Junked was the only one I visited as it had the one thing I couldn't get anywhere else.  So basically the best thing ever. So much so, that I skipped the whole food building at the CNE. I was content with my scoop of dough. Kinda wished I bought an extra scoop to eat during the car ride home.... We will certainly visit the Queen st. location for more dough!"}
{"text":"The first deep dish joint in Toronto!!! This is my second time visiting Junked Food Co and I loved both experiences. The staff both times were super helpful with advising me on what to order.  I've had the Mac and cheese deep dish and honestly it was really filling, I ordered a small and finished one piece. I'd eat the Mac and cheese on its own as well as in a deep dish because it was that good. The dough was cooked to perfection.  My FAVE fries ever! Desperado Fries had a little spicy kick to them with the jalapeños which I loved. I took my friend there the second time I went and I think it's safe to say she's also hooked on the fries now.   I was also introduced to their new pan pizzas the second time I went. I had Mac and cheese but it wasn't the ordinary Mac and cheese. It was flavoured with an Alfredo sauce which is genius! Creamy texture and pretty light so we were able to eat a lot more as opposed to the Mac and cheese deep dish. They both have different tastes and I liked both but I'd say the pan pizza Mac and cheese with the Alfredo sauce was better.  Overall, clean interior, friendly staff, fast service and best of all yummy food!"}
{"text":"I had to choose between going to get gelato, or going to Junked Food Co and getting a waffle cone with edible cookie dough... I mean, come on!  As a lover of junk food and sugar, everything on the menu looked and sounded amazing. But when I saw that they had a peanut butter cookie dough with Reese's Pieces, I absolutely had to order it. I was told they don't do waffle cones anymore, which was super disappointing, so I settled for a cup of cookie dough. They made it fresh to order, and when I picked it up, I was surprised by just how heavy and dense it was. The cookie dough itself was pretty good, it definitely resembles raw dough. However, my cup was probably 70% Reese's Pieces and 30% dough. I ate some of it, and then separated out all of the pieces from the dough... the pieces filled up the entire cup on their own. Don't get me wrong, I love all things Reese's, but I wanted to eat cookie dough, not candy stuck together with some dough."}
{"text":"This review is based on their cookie dough desserts. I'm a big fan of things birthday cake related (lots of sprinkles!!!). I came here to try their birthday party cookie dough and they were relatively busy so it was quite a wait. Then it came, it looked very colourful, bright and delicious as you can really smell the cookie dough. At first it would it really good but after awhile, it starts getting too much as they really load it up with sugar and I don't do too well with super sweet things. If you can't finish it, you can get it to go and eat it later. It's been in my list to try one of these things out so I'm glad I got to do so?!"}
{"text":"Tried out their smash bag for the first time. The cashier was really helpful in explaining the menu and telling us recommendations. It was tasty but not necessarily an original taste. We got the tacho bag which contained tater tots, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and olives.  Good snack but overpriced"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant / food place I have ever eaten at. I would recommend this place if you're in the mood for flavourless food. Avoid this place. How you're able to make bland and tasteless macaroni and cheese is beyond me. A complete waste of money and I'm incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried junked food a little while ago with the bf for the cookie dough scoops (benefit of having a significant other is forcing them to share a dessert with you so you don't get the full calories)  It was pretty underwhelming to be honest. Nothing you wouldn't expect. Not sure if I'd return to try anything else with all the other yummy desserts around the city but it's definitely a cool concept place and I'm glad t came to the neighbourhood.  They also have a phone charging station which is always nice :)"}
