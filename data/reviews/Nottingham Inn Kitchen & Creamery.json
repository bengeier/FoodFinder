{"text":"I've been here for breakfast and lunch so far in the past few months. Both meals were exceptional and, I think, fairly priced. The staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant was very clean and well put-together.  I would have preferred that my meal came with fries rather than Herr's chips, and would have preferred draft beer over bottles, but these are small complaints. The beer I ordered has actually become a new favorite!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with 5 adults and two little ones under 3 yrs of age - A Great Choice!  Nice lunch choices - food was delicious!  Good Children's Menu - and very friendly staff!  I had the turkey club and it was delicious - roasted pieces of turkey piled high!  Others had burgers and fish & chips.  Everyone felt that the food was delicious and well priced!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite after a Herr's Factory Tour. The food was fresh, locally sourced and cooked well. The restaurant was very clean and the staff was very friendly.   We had the burger, crispy shrimp wrap and the clam chowder.  All were good, especially the clam chowder. We will eat here again, if we are ever back."}
{"text":"My hubs found this quaint charmer while searching for a casual place to rendezvous with friends nearby! I read most of reviews and was intrigued! EVERYTHING I read about this delightful restaurant was true; right down to the whimsical setting and the 5 STAR service! Emmely earned a generous tip providing OUTSTANDING humorously presented service!!  I ordered the Brisket dinner (see photos) and hubs had daily special: fish filets 'breaded' w Herr's potato chips, of course! And accompanied by wonderfully seasoned al dente green beans and large serving of mashed potatoes piped into plate with a swirly floral design! Nice presentation for 'home-style' cooking! Hubs cleaned his plate commenting it was delicious!! Being a Texas gal, I am partial to Texas style beef brisket and although this is shredded style beef brisket the flavor was pretty good, portion too large to consume (so I had a delicious lunch a day later!) and came w Cole slaw and sweet potato fries! Both were delicious! AND they have a wonderful house horseradish dip for the sweet potato fries that was 'mouthwatering-great' and I don't usually care for horseradish flavor!!  I highly recommend saving room for either their daily made desserts or the ice cream for which their summer Creamery is famous! We four had ice cream and it did not disappoint; rich flavors blended w high fat content cream made a delightful summer treat! I had mine in a fresh sugar cone and could not lick fast enough! WELL WORTH the 29 mile drive for us and we are already planning our return visit.  If visiting on a Sunday, I highly recommend arriving at 2:45 to have your choice of tables! They close from 2-3 and it filled up FAST! It is quaint size holding about a dozen tables and has bar seating for perhaps another 10-12.  And if you can't make a meal; you won't be disappointed if you only stop at the Creamery! Some pretty enticing whipped cream loaded desserts were viewed as we exited! I am saving my calories for one of those!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner on recommendation of a friend. Wow! My wife and I both picked the rib eye steak with fries and both were probably the best we've enjoyed. Steak locally sourced and cooked perfectly. The fries must have some Herr's mojo as the flavor was outstanding. Staff could not have been nicer, greeting us warmly when we entered and hitting that perfect balance of attentive service and relaxed pace. This place has the vibe of greatness and we look forward to their continued success. Strongly recommended and we look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"YUMMY...best breakfast in the area. Everything was fresh. The waitstaff is very friendly and courteous  .  We would highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"This was more of a diner than an Inn. There appeared to be multiple buildings, but we found the Inn to be at the Creamery. Mushroom soup and dessert were tasty, but the meat entrees wee overcooked and tasteless. Disappointing food, but the service was friendly and attr"}
{"text":"Great food, today was breakfast at the counter. Eggs Benedict was my choice and just like all my visits here so far, I was greeted with a friendly hello and quick service as well as excellent food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I often eat breakfast here with the family. Consistently good food, good coffee too. Sometimes wish the place was a little bigger so they would have more seats for the crowd. However, the staff turns tables around at a good pace and the wait is tolerable. We typically order items like omelettes, French toast, bacon, eggs Benedict, pancakes...but today my daughter tried the creamed chipped beef and was a little disappointed. Too salty and tasted pre-packaged. The whole table tried some of it and agreed. Still beats out other local establishments in terms of the other items, service and atmosphere, but seeing this is her new fave breakfast meal, may have to check out other options. Last thing, why not use REAL maple syrup? I don't feel that Aunt Jemima does their food any justice.  Still 4 stars because lunch and most breakfast experiences have been good."}
{"text":"Good food and good service . We got the crab chowder it was very tasty. We also got the fried chicken and the crab cake dinner . We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and on the chalkboard where specials are listed, I thought it said \"pumpkin pie.\" Turned out it was a pumpkin pie ale, and when I was disappointed it wasn't actually pie, the woman behind the counter had someone run over to their adjunct kitchen and get a pie so I could have some. Now that's what I call special! AND it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome, freshest ingredients anywhere. Hummus platter came with the crispiest cucumbers and creamiest feta ever, 3 different flavors of hummus, quite a meal in itself. Crabcakes were excellent; fresh cut fries delicious.  Scallops with mushroom risotto were ridiculous, scallops seared to perfection, the mushrooms in the risotto were quite exotic, and still had great texture. The kitchen should be very proud of what they do! Staff and management were very accommodating, we arrived half hour before the dinner menu started, but they graciously served us a few minutes early.  Will return, wished we lived closer, but we'll make it a tradition to/from Maryland as much as possible."}
{"text":"Some of the best food around!  You cannot do better than the Nottingham Inn. We stayed at the motel portion of the Inn due to power outages from the ice storm. We had dinner and breakfast the next morning from the kitchen. The food was fantastic both times.   For dinner we had: Crab cake sandwich with fries Fried chicken platter Meat loaf platter Turkey dinner 3 orders of mushroom soup (I could have eaten two cups by myself, it was that good)  For breakfast we had: Blueberry pancakes Raisin french toast Bacon egg and cheese sandwich Loaded Omelet  Side of scrapple  2 yogurt and granola with strawberries and blueberries   Everyone was happy and well fed. We all  said we would go again for dinner and take out. Luckily our power was restored, unfortunately we were unable to taste the lunch offerings :)   On a side note about staying in the motel- We were very happy to have heat and water at the motel during the ice storm. We brought our dogs which was so nice considering most places are not pet friendly. The rooms are very dated, and need some updating. However, it was clean and could really be turned into something nice :)"}
{"text":"Best restaurant, hands down in the area. The food is always cooked to perfection, always comes out fast, the staff is the friendliest bunch of people you will ever come across. We are regulars and they know what we need the minute we sit down. They treat you like old friends there...new or old customers. They have a special for breakfast, lunch and dinner which changes everyday. This is a must place to stop in if you are in the area....you will not be disappointed and if you are. It's your own fault for being a sour puss."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here fairly often and love having a farm to table restaurant so close by that's also reasonably priced. The service is always excellent and we've tried most everything on the menu. I love when they have their grilled cheese week!!"}
{"text":"This place was great!  It is a nice little diner with great food, service, and atmosphere.  We came for lunch - it was packed, but the food still got out very quickly and was delicious.  Perfect place to stop before or after the Herr's Snack Factory Tour and there is a wonderful Creamery attached, so you can satisfy your ice cream fix afterwards."}
{"text":"Our server Raquel was amazing. Kind, attentive and willing to make things up special according to what you like."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come out here for breakfast twice now and are HUGE fans.  Great food, service and ambiance that has never disappointed."}
{"text":"Great local place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Local wine and beer. Friendly staff. For breakfast I like the skillet-homefries, onions, green pepper and your choice of meat all chopped up with two eggs any way o  top and choice of bread. For lunch i like the chicken salad srrved with green salad, apples, and walnuts.  For dinner I get fish and chips, french dip, or their local black angus burger. l Recommended."}
{"text":"We tried the restaurant out for breakfast today and I am now going to be a regular.  The casual and nicely decorated decor is equally matched by the quality of the food.  Server was very nice and you can tell this is a well run family business."}
{"text":"I've been here once, and it was phenomenal!! It was so packed we couldn't find a table, only the counter had open seats! Everything is homemade cooked fresh to order. Might I reccomend the French Dip, it is top notch! Afterwords, go next door to their ice cream shoppe, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"An awesome place to eat. They are always very friendly and accommodating! If your hungry for desert you can have fresh ice cream from their attached ice cream shop. My family loves this place!!!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times now and this is my new favorite spot. Every dish has been delicious snd the staff is awesome! Big shout out to emily she has been my waitress before and I saw her last time and she has such a bright personality shes great.. everyone we have met has been great. Food is so good even desserts that r mouth watering"}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal here tonight, after spending the day at Dutch Wonderland. From the minute we walked in, everyone was friendly and welcoming. Our dinner was delicious, one of the best French dips I've ever had! The creamy cauliflower soup was yummy too. We finished off the meal with some ice cream at the adjoined creamery and it was SO good! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great place for any meal. Tonight's special was Dijon Crusted Trout! Awesome and reasonably priced at $16.95! Great ice cream too! Friendly  servers and very clean! Hummus platter is exceptional! Breakfast and lunch equally great!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here, so I maybe biased, but on the other hand I'm a regular here because the food here is delicious and the staff here is phenomenal.   The meals here all feel home cooked, everything is cooked from scratch. The breakfast is amazing and the lunch and dinner menu will both feel like grandma is cooking. Definitely of the comfort food variety.  I mostly go here for breakfast and get my huge pancakes, or the delicious French toast, but I do like getting dinner here as well. The menu never gets boring, in fact the most interesting meal, is the meal of the day. They always put some wild experimental meal that is always delicious that changes from breakfast to lunch. So I am never bored there. They have hand picked microbrews and delicious desserts which includes the ice cream from their creamery.   Long story short, place may be small, but it is cozy and friendly. The food is terrific and never boring. It is definitely worth a try if you are passing by or if you live in an area and are looking for a new go to spot. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been here many times for breakfast and a few times for dinner. Service is always excellent. Food is always good. Do yourself a favor and have the Fried Chicken Dinner.  It may be a small place but it's big on taste."}
{"text":"Great place!  Worth every star I can give it. The decor is nice, wait staff smiling and very accommodating. The food was fabulous. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff.  Sunday after 9 usually has 20 min wait. Fast paced. Would like to see more specials with fresh local fruit or vegetables"}
{"text":"Good luck finding a seat, but when you do, expect friendly service and delicious food in a charming small town setting.  Breakfast menu is exceptional. Went with a few friends before a golf outing recently and needed some Old Bay and Hot Sauce to make Bloody Mary's.  Waitress emerged with a gift bag containing two ramekins of OB and a fresh bottle of Texas Pete; on the house.  What a nice gesture.  Will return again and again."}
{"text":"My friends and I dine here often for breakfast, and we are never disappointed. Kela is an excellent server: it doesn't matter how busy the restaurant is, she always makes us feel like we are her only table. The serving sizes are generous, the pancakes fluffy, bacon cooked crisp, and the coffee piping hot. Add to that the fact that every time I order eggs, they are cooked perfectly. In short, breakfast at the Nottingham Inn is about as excellent as breakfast can be."}
{"text":"Boy, were we surprised by this little Greek bistro!  The gyros were totally delicious and the wings meaty, juicy, and sticky saucy.  The fries were super crispy on the outside and tasty, real on the inside.  The Greek salad with hearty chunks of feta cheese was a perfectly authentic accompaniment to the gyros.  It's the food that matters most here.  But the counter staff, servers, cooks, and management couldn't be nicer or friendlier.  It's a cute space with simple tables and seating but very clean and neat.  The open grill and food prep area means it's a bit warm on hot days, but we look forward to fall and winter visits when it will be comfortably cozy.  The prices are super reasonable and the menu only features a few Greek dishes, but there's something for every taste, including pizzas that we're having soon.  My guess is that we are going to discover all the food here is prepared with that classic Greek diner flair and care that's not easy to find in these parts."}
{"text":"Arrived  earlier  then expected  so had house  omelet.  Well done and great  potatoes. Wanted to do lunch  so have to stop back  and take Herr tour at factory across the street. Plenty  parking  as older  restaurant  building  closed  in favor of the new smaller  place  with ice cream shop  attached. Busy place but friendly staff. Nice garden  in front well maintained."}
{"text":"This is a lovely little cafe where a long time friend and I met recently for \"second breakfast\". Real food! They were serving their breakfast menu, which covers the expected gambit, utilizing fresh local ingredients. We both had eggs, and I got a chance to try the delicious scrapple - something you don't find just everywhere! The cook was very accommodating, adding cheddar cheese to the grits. The wait staff is both efficient and friendly.  I was only sorry that I did not have room for more...."}
{"text":"Just had the worst meal ever at this restaurant. The food was passable, the service as always was exceptional, but what I was served was insultingly over-priced and pathetically under-portioned. I ordered the open-faced meatloaf sandwich platter. It was supposed to come on Texas toast, with hand-cut fries on the side. The meatloaf couldn't even be considered a child's portion. Three tiny pieces maybe 1/2 thick at best, and when I put them all together on the plate, it was about the diameter of a baseball. The \"Texas toast\" wasn't toasted at all, and as far as I could tell, it was just plain old potato bread. The fries were good, tho. In fact, the cooks must pride themselves on their fries, because they took up over half the platter! No doubt to make up for the sadly lacking meatloaf. What did I pay for this meal? $11.95!!  For fries, bread, and a teeny little piece of meatloaf. What a RIP. OFF. Looking for a nice place to have lunch? Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining here on St. Patrick's Day. New to the area we found them on Yelp and checked their website which advertised a St. Patrick Day special menu so we gave it a shot thinking it would probably be the standard cheap corned beef and cabbage but we didn't find many other options in the area.  We were pleasantly surprised with the food, it was fantastic, some of the best corned beef I've had in over 10 years. Dessert was fantastic as well which was a Baileys Irish Creme cake that was out of this world.  We had a great server named Emily (hope I got that right, my hearing is awful) that made us feel at home and was very attentive.   We will definitely be back and we think you won't regret stopping by here for a meal or just ice cream if your in a sweet tooth mood."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat!  Food was good and service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, all the sandwiches are good loved the hot chicken buffalo sandwich and the sweet potato fries. Quality food, very efficient service!"}
{"text":"Love this place! eat here a couple times a week usually. every meal is great, and their nightly specials are usually what i get. great atmosphere and staff on top of everything else. thanks!"}
{"text":"Great spot with local flair.  There isn't much in this area but this little place is a GEM!  My parents live near here and we took them here for Saturday before Easter lunch the meal was great and the service grand.  I totally recommend the crab cakes (I'm critical) and really everything was wonderful."}
{"text":"We were searching ed quickly. Wait staff was very kind and efficient. Food came quickly despite a full house. Chesapeake eggs Benedict was delicious. Bathrooms were clean, easy parking. Great place all around !!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here several times now and it has been consistenly fantastic.  The food is always good and the service is excellent as well.  It has to be the best restaurant in the area.  So if your in the Nottingham area and looking for a place to eat check them out I think you will be pleased.  Almost forgot, the ice cream parlor is open for the summer so I had to try it.  I had a hot fudge sunday, not on the diet but was well worth the extra calories, I'm not a real ice cream aficionado but if you are I think you will enjoy what they have to offer.  They also have a rewards program, I think the deal is after you collect 200 points you get $10 off on your next meal, we have already had 2 of those.  So enjoy."}
{"text":"Everything was good except one thing. The food was good, the time between ordering and recovering the food was good, the actual facilities were good, but the service wasn't the best. They were really chatty. When they would come to your table they definitely didn't try to sound like they cared about you or your meal. The staff at the creamery were talking and conversing with themselves rather than speaking to their customers and asking what they wanted, the customers instead had to get their attention which isn't appealing at all. I'd recommend it but be warned about the not so welcoming staff. I get that it's tiring and boring sometimes but a job is a job and you just gotta do it and do it well. (Unless it's drug dealing and prostitution. This are illegal. Don't do those well.)"}
{"text":"Pork tenderloin was delicious as was the sautéed shrimp special. This place is very charming we will be back again"}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience.  First off, I have to commend the staff.  I have never had friendlier wait staff anywhere.  The menu was just right.  The ingredients were fresh and local, and the menu had just the right amound of sophistication and home cooking.  We had breakfast and I had the Eggs Benedict made with Cajun bacon and avocado.  My husband ordered the barbecue beef brisket omelette.  Although we each like a little heavier flavors to our food, I will say everything was cooked quite beautifully and was delicious!   The orange juice is fresh sqeezed!  We already were looking at the lunch and dinner menus, planning ahead!  I can't believe we haven't been to this little gem in the country before.  Glad to add another local establishment to the list of places we will be bringing firends and family to when they come to visit.   Not to be forgotten is the Nottingham Creamery attached to the Inn restaraunt.  We have frequented them in the past. Delicious, generous ice cream servings and the staff is just as friendly as the restaraunt. Do not pass up the opportunity to eat here!  This the the best of quality, atmosphere, class and service your are going to see!  A lot of places should be sending their staff here for training!   Thank-you, Nottingham Inn for a wonderful experience on my breakfast date! This is going to be a regular destination for us from now on!"}
{"text":"My boyfriends and mines favorite place to eat, they have the nicest servers and the best food. We always come here for breakfast with each other or our family. Best place around!"}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy The Nottingham Inn. Their breakfast omelettes and chipped beef over toast are two of our favorites! Their lunches are good. They don't serve mashed potatoes with lunch (wish they would...especially with some of their sandwiches like open faced turkey or the meatloaf).  Service is always great.  Waitresses are friendly.  Atmosphere reminds me of dining in a cabin. Very serene.  Give it a try! You won't be disappointed!!  They serve ice cream in the front of the building....so save too for dessert after lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute little place just across the street from the Herr's Factory. It was also recently purchased by Herr's. Lots of folks come to the factory for tours, so this is a great place to grab a bite before and/or after.   Once you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the staff and made to feel at home. It is quite small, but feels like you are in a small town and everyone knows your name.   I was told that mushroom country is very close- and to try the stuffed portobello's and/or mushroom soup. I did not, but some others at my table did and they said it was phenomenal. The beef they use here comes from the cows that are raised from the extra corm meal/waste from the Herr's factory. I've seem this so called \"waste\" and if I was a cow I would be very happy to eat it. So that being said, I tried the burger which was very delicious. Not the best burger of my life but in the top 80%. It had two strips of bacon, cheddar cheese, sliced tomatoes, and bibb lettuce. The sandwiches come with either Herr's chips or fries (regular or sweet potato) and i chose fries since I had been eating those Herr's chips all day!   There was a cute little family while I was in there and they all ordered ice cream. The cones and sundaes looked awesome and I wished that I had room to get one as well.   I always think you can tell a lot from the bathroom at a restaurant- and this bathroom was definitely an A+! It was white and clean and nicely decorated and smelled GOOD?! lol Places that have nice bathrooms are run by someone who cares."}
{"text":"Just had a late breakfast at Nottingham Inn with my boyfriend. If you are in the area, I suggest you stop in. The place is very clean and charming. The staff were very sweet and welcoming when we walked in. The food was excellent and served fast. I will definitely be returning! Also the coffee was good, and that's important! :) 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"I have been reading reviews about Nottingham Inn, decided to give it a try. It is a family style restaurant.  The food was very good, the service was excellent.   I would definitely go back there.  The menu is not  huge, but all the meals looks excellent.  The place was packed.  The are specials every night, and I would recommend trying them.  The prices are reasonable.   The locals are trying to keep this place a secret!"}
{"text":"We love this place. It's small, but consistently good. Reminds us of the little hole-in-the-wall places you find near ski resorts. Great, friendly wait staff, excellent diverse menu, and even nice craft beer selection. My favorite thing here is the turkey Reuben. Ummmmmm! And their kaluha hot chocolate is to die for!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast. The food was really good, I got French toast and eggs. Both were cooked perfectly and not bland in taste. The place was a little small and crowded but warm, cozy and inviting."}
{"text":"I like this place, but it is not a five star restaurant, folks.  They have a small seating area that is a bit noisy, good food, a handful of microbrews on tap, and a delicious selection of ice cream that they make on site (if I an not mistaken).  We are here with our kids and it was fun and tasty.  A solid three star meal."}
{"text":"The Nottingham Inn never disappoints!  Today we went in to find a new menu and I finally decided on the Tortellini Salad since I wasn't exactly starving.  The serving portion was large and very reasonably priced! The flavor was fantastic and if you like feta cheese,  it's a must try! I would definitely order this again and my husband also gave it a thumbs up.  I was pretty full after the salad but after seeing the dessert menu I couldn't pass up trying the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Cake. (So much for not being that hungry when I walked in) I enjoyed it and didn't leave a crumb but my husband ordered the warm blueberry pie with ice cream and it was amazing! My husband and I have been here quite a few times now and have always left 100 percent satisfied! The service is always great and the food is always so fresh and flavorful!  This is truly one of our favorite spots!  I will also add that their menu selection isn't huge but they seem excel at everything they make and their prices are very affordable!"}
{"text":"For us this place seems to be a hit or miss.  The only thing that is always great is the staff.  One morning I ordered simple basic scrambled eggs, they were loaded with cinnamon ... I hate to send things back but they were truly gross.  They replaced them and again they were full of cinnamon.  Our waitress was awesome and got upset with the kitchen when she was told there was nothing they could do about it, eggs and French toast are cooked on the same spot of the grill.  Needless to say I never did get breakfast and had to stop at McDonalds after we left. On the flip side their French Dip is SO good along with their burgers and a few of the dinner entrees. My biggest complaint about the place is their prices.  I wouldn't mind paying $40-$50 for a meal if it was truly worth it, but it rarely is.  We only use this place in a pinch because it's so close by. Oh but the ice cream in front of the restaurant is a true family favorite that we go to often.  The young girls in there work so hard and are as sweet as can be ... don't forget to tip them! :0)"}
{"text":"We go to the Nottingham in every now and then. Never once have we been disappointed. The food is really good, the service is excellent and the value is totally reasonable. Tonight I had the chicken Oscar which was new to the menu, it was delicious. I would definitely order it again. My husband ordered the shrimp stirfry. He thought it was really good but probably would not order it again. We sat at the counter across from the kitchen and saw so many meals that we would like to try."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite and sat at the counter. Waitresses seem to all have their own assignment and I sat quite a long time both waiting for service and getting my check with several waitresses just standing directly in front of me. One waitress may have been elsewhere, but couldn't others turn around & pitch in?"}
{"text":"Ok, so tonight my wife and I stopped in for dinner. We were sat immediately ( just like always) and greeted by a very friendly waitress. I ordered the fish and chips. It came quickly and was delicious. Three big pieces of lightly breaded haddock, coleslaw, and seasoned fries. The tarter sauce and lemon really pulled the meal together. After the meal I knew I should have called it quits because I was full but I didn't stop there. I ordered the blueberry pie with a scoop of vanilla. It was so good. The pie was served warm but was still firm. I felt like I needed to be wheeled out of there after consuming these delightful vittles. Don't worry, I managed to make it to my vehicle safely and I'm currently laying in a vegetative state on the couch. I can't wait to head back there. Check it out."}
{"text":"Very very very good meal. Small and adorable restaurant! So glad I went. Spare ribs were so good and melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Very nice place with great food and service.  The food wash fresh and the ice cream was amazing."}
{"text":"This has been a excellent addition to the Oxford dining scene since the day it opened.  The winning combination of good food, good prices and good staff proved Oxford will support a restaurant in the long run.  Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner all have good selections and tasty food.  The specials are always particularly good.  Go & Enjoy.  Heads-up.  It's generally crowded so be prepared for a wait"}
{"text":"We love it here! Best breakfast, best dinner and best desserts! The service is outstanding! Great atmosphere, very cozy."}
{"text":"Small country atmosphere, very small menu, the service is as good as any 5 star restaurant in a big city but more friendly.  Food was pretty  good. Soft serve ice cream for desert was probably the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick dinner. Food was delicious!  I got the meatloaf and mashed potato dinner. My son got the tree cheese tortellini. Both were super good.  Loved the gravy on the mashed potatoes.  Just sorry we didn't save room for the homemade blueberry pie, which looked amazing. If you come on a Friday night get there early.  The place fills up fast.  Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Opted for this place after we did the Herr's tour.  Apparently Herr's owns this place.  With a name like Nottingham Inn, I was expecting a fancy old place.  What we found instead was a confusing parking lot with a large old building up front and the restaurant tucked away in the back right corner.  A little confusing.    Anyway, on to the meat and potatoes of the review!!! I had the open face Angus roast beef with fries.  Wife had the chicken salad, son had a burger.  They boast that the scraps from the plant are fed to the beef that is used at the Inn.  My meal was great, nice big portion and tender as a wet tissue. Fries were fresh cut.  Perfect meal for a rainy day.  Wife enjoyed hers, said the salad was seasoned good and fresh.  I could not see any burger left, so I will assume the young lad enjoyed his burger.    Place is not fancy, looks like an old cabin inside.  Seating is crowded, but the food was tasty, place was clean, price was right.    One of the owners of Herr's sat next to us, my wife recognized him from the tour video.  I wanted to get a selfie with him, but she would not let me.  :-(  After that meal, she drove home, I was sleeping by the time we hit honeybrook!!  Zzzzzzzz"}
{"text":"Hands down best restaurant in this area. Food is fresh (farm to table), small selection done extremely well. I have never had a bad meal here. Place is always packed, I just hope the word doesn't spread too much!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! My parents come here for dinner quite often and took me when I came to visit. The food is excellent! I had the turkey Rueben with sweet potato fries, my mom had the portobello mushroom wrap, my dad had the shrimp wrap and my brother had the pork chops - all were amazing!! I am so glad we came here!"}
{"text":"The Nottingham doesn't have a very big menu so there isn't much to choose from.  But the burgers are good and the sandwiches are tasty.  The service was really good.  There is also a separate ice cream shop that is open during the summer.  That part has an outdoor area so if you just wanted ice cream you could bring your dog and enjoy."}
{"text":"A hidden gem along the PA-MD line, the Nottingham Inn Kitchen & Creamery serves up yummy comfort food with a twist. The dining room is wood paneled and gives off a retro cabin vibe. The service is quick as can be - the waitress was incredibly kind. Absolutely delicious burgers and HUGE ice cream sundaes! Large portions for great prices too. Overall a must if you are visiting the Herr's Factory or if you are just passing through."}
{"text":"Delicious Linner.  Meatloaf for Gary and Pan seared pork chop with Italian vegetable salad.  Service was top notch and dinner served promptly."}
{"text":"Just left this awesome restaurant.  Rachel was our server.  She was amazing.  Friendly and helpful.  We found this restaurant on our way to Lancaster- stopped because of yelp reviews & so glad we did.  Great food and finished off the meal with homemade ice cream.  Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to visit, great food, a great wait staff, and the managers are hands down amazing! If you make it during the summer time the ladies in the creamery do a great job too!"}
{"text":"I agree with many of the comments on the previous reviews.  The service is very attentive.  But the food leaves a bit to be desired.  I had the Cream of Mushroom soup which was salty, globby thick but with very little mushroom favor.  I thought being in such close proximity to Kennett Square that the soup would be a stand out.  Croutons on the Caesar salad were stale.  The grilled cheese was okay, but the sweet potato fries were quite good.  A word of caution if you go during the winter, the counter seats can be downright cold and drafty."}

{"text":"Great place! Warm and friendly staff, really good food, reasonably priced. Treat you like family!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! I recently met a friend (yes I have one) here for dinner and was really impressed. The food is not inventive but it is high quality and the staff are very friendly. The fish and chips were very light and fresh with malt vinegar available. The burger was also excellent, cooked to order with all the trimmings. Small but well curated selection of beers. Got an ice cream sundae for dessert and it was so big that finishing it was out of the question. Definitely a great place to stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  The staff is very friendly.  The food is very food.  Served hot and fast.  Ice Cream menu has great options.  Priced pretty fair.  We will definitely be coming back here once we are settled and make it a regular stop!"}
{"text":"Some of the best food around. We go here a lot.  We have never had a bad meal or service. The Herr's family is doing it right. All food is local and it shows. Thanks for being in Nottingham!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good location so I want to like this place because good restaurants are needed in this area. I do recommend their fish and chips. It goes great with their many beer choices. There are definitely too many starches and carbs on the menu and not enough vegetables or sides available. It should be more farm to table and use the fresh vegetables available such as kale, asparagus, zucchini, peas etc. and have more specials. They should have excellent soups but they have been somewhat bland. I miss their fried tomatoes salad they used to have on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food service. We always enjoy this little breakfast spot. A GREAT way to start a sunday."}
{"text":"Been here only twice and both times food is delish, must tries are the short rib sandwich and the crispy pulled pork sticks. They are both very good."}
{"text":"This place is great. Every meal has great options with reasonable prices. The wait staff is very friendly. Being able to get an ice cream cone, or shake to go after dinner is also a nice treat."}
{"text":"Friendly and Helpful Staff - They messed my order up & actually insisted that they pay for my burger; that was very friendly. For that - I have to give them 4 Stars - Burger was really good; fresh ingredients. We were very Happy with the experience!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight. Everything could not have been better! Food, Service and Décor was great!!! Salad had no Iceberg that I saw! And Chicken and Dumplings were so good!"}
{"text":"My favorite local restaurant.    The food is always great and they source many ingredients/support  local."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday after almost finishing my meal I swallowed a hair which was so long half was down my throat and the other was hanging from my mouth I pulled it out and can't bring myself to go there again I used to be a frequent patron with a rewards card."}
{"text":"I can't say much positive about this place. The rooms are incredibly antiquated. We estimated the TV was 25-30 years old. There was rust and mold in the showers and the vending machines didn't work. The staff is only around during the day so if you need anything at night, you are out of luck. It is convenient since there are no other hotels in the area, but it may be worth it to travel a little farther for something more modern."}
{"text":"Nottingham Kitchen and Creamery is our favorite place to eat out.  Fresh local food, great daily specials, professional staff that make you feel at home and a cozy atmosphere...don't forget to try the ice cream!"}
{"text":"My Dad and eat here once a week for lunch.  It's our special little time and we always enjoy the service and the food.  The clam chowder is very good, as is the house salad.  The salad is not simply an iceberg salad, it has nice field greens.  The chicken club sandwich comes with REAL grilled chicken.  I've had the burger, the crab cakes, and the fries - all are excellent.  The fried tomato and shrimp salad was surprisingly good, too (I didn't think I would like fried tomatoes).  It's a tad pricey; but overall worth the money."}
{"text":"I have become quite the regular here for breakfast at least 1 day a week and an occasional dinner. The wait staff especially the morning crew are awesome, food is always good and presented well, and very affordable."}
