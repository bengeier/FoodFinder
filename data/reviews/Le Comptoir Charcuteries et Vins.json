{"text":"We randomly fell upon this restaurant along St. Laurent as the restaurant we had reservations for *cough* La Montee de Lait *cough* was closed with no head's up notice. Distraught we walked around aimlessly trying to find a restaurant to eat at - we were STARVED. I think it was meant to be because we were pleasantly surprised.

We ordered the charcuterie board with beet salad and lobster tarte. The charcuterie was just oh-kay. I think Black Hoof in Toronto is much better. However, the Beet Salad was D-I-V-I-N-E. The goat cheese and all the beautiful flavours just stirred up all your tastebuds in ways never before.

We sat at the bar so we were able to watch everything be made - which lead to us wanting to order the dessert. We got the lemon curd and the chocolate \"cake\" (can't seem to remember the name of it).

Only downside? For tourists.. we don't know french and the entire menu is in French! Luckily we had a server who translated 80% of the menu for us. Oh, and service is a tad slow. You have to flag your waiter down."}
{"text":"Like many other places in Montreal this restaurant has an open kitchen. The chef is right there in front of you performing his magic. Overall impression - very creative and very good. I would say also very different from traditional, with emphasis on presentation but not at the expense of quality. 
 Very attentive service. The chef even made the desert for us which was not on the brunch menu after finding out we were from Boston and would not have a chance to return for a while.
 My girlfriend ordered a drink with Aperol which was very good.
 We have not ordered coffee but watching them make it, I am guessing it's also good.
 My only complaint is that the choice of wine by the glass is limited, so I ordered a beer. Wine is a part of the name of this establishment, so I expected a larger selection. (The wine list by the bottle is extensive)
 We are looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Cuisine délicieuse dans une ambiance décontractée.
Vins délicieux et excellents conseils des serveurs.

Le journal Metro en parle comme l un des meilleurs resto de Montréal.
Incontestablement une valeur sure pour un très bon rapport qualité/prix."}
{"text":"Le Comptoir is one of my favourite restaurants in Montreal.  Every time I come here I'm always extremely satisfied with my food.  Everything is done so beautifully here the cooks are artists.  If you aren't a big group I suggest seating at the bar it's the best seat in the house.  The kitchen is right in front of you when you are at the bar and it is truly an entertaining show watching them prepare the food.  Watching them cook you can tell they love their job and you can taste it when your food arrives."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service, but food was not good despite the inventive menu.  We ordered about half the items on the menu, but was a bit disappointed by the taste. The lamb turned out to be a cold dish and not very flavorful, the beef had an odd taste to it and the porchetta was also ok only. The octopus and the lobster pie were good."}
{"text":"Comme toujours ces restaurants à la mode coûtent trop cher mais je dois avouer que mis à part le prix excessifs pour un repas du midi (29,50 $ avec le pourboire et sans vin), la qualité les saveurs étaient là. Je ne crois pas avoir les moyens d'y retourner rapidement. 

Des tables d'hôte du midi à 19 $ me semble exagérer et sans rapport avec les portions et la qualité. Ça valait au plus 15 $, dommage"}
{"text":"Chaque fois que j'y vais, je ne suis jamais déçue! J'ai toujours eu un bon service, et en s'assoyant au comptoir, on peut avoir un oeil sur tous les plats qui se préparent. Mon plat favori reste le chou-fleur rôti."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner when I was in town for the Grand Prix Cycliste. Unfortunately I was by myself and so didn't get to take full advantage of the menu, all of which looked amazing, but having saved both my money and my stomach by skipping lunch I was able to fully appreciate the charcuterie board and sweetbreads over a pea broth with arugula, both of which were fantastic! 

place has a hip vibe, very friendly and accommodating staff  (my paltry knowledge of French was not a problem at all). I loved the open kitchen, sitting at the bar watching the chefs working together like a well oiled machine (occasional dishes actually flying to the dishpit providing some exciting \"dinner theatre\") was a worthwhile experience."}
{"text":"Great food but portion is a bit small for guys an some girls like me... Place is tiny so recommend reservation before your visit:))"}
{"text":"This is the first place my boyfreind and I hsd our first day & ever since weve been going there.. the first time we didnt know what to order so because we love food so much!! We decided to order almost everything.. so now when we go , we know exactly what we like.. I love the fact thats its an open kitchen and I always make sure to get seats at the bar , I just enjoy watching them cook , also they take it to a whole other level , the way they plate , its like art! It is art! People are freindly and so nice .. the meat platter is to die for & everything is made in house. So you can only imagine the goodness thats on your plate! If your from montreal & never been .. drop whatever it is youre doing and GO its an expirience :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were referred to Le Comptoir on a weekend trip to Montreal.  The small restaurant has a wonderfully local feel and a very comfortable but lively ambiance.  We had the small charcuterie plate to start, and octopus with chorizo and chicken manicotti for entrees. I would not even order octopus in many of my dining experiences, since it has to be prepared just right.  This was an incredible meal and the octopus was prepared perfectly!"}
{"text":"Mon arrêt obligatoire lorsque je vais voir un spectacle à la sala rossa ou à la casa del popolo, Le Comptoir sert une cuisine convivial dans une ambiance décontracté, un endroit à fréquenter !"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely stellar!!! I wanted to make a reservation via email and they called me to make it as I am in the U.S. I had the most delicious combination of chanterelles, pork tongue & ravioli stuffed with parsley root alongside an absolutely fabulous piece of salmon accompanied by tarragon oil and puree of celeriac. Tres bon!"}
{"text":"There really isn't anything else I can write that hasn't been written before me on the 5 star reviews for LE COMPTOIR CHARCUTERIE ET VINS. 

Myself and boyfriend arrived on a Monday evening recently with no reservation, at 5pm. We were invited to sit at the bar and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Everyone of the staff, including the hostess engaged with us, which is something we always appreciate. Their knowledge of the menu and help with selection from the menu and wines was superb. Staff are a credit to the restaurant. The tables began filling up very quickly from 5:30 ... We felt we had the best vantage point for kitchen and people watching. Hostess suggested we order no more than 5 choices between us, especially since we knew we would be having desert. The tongue especially stood out for me as an exceptional dish. The deserts .... To die for. So good I could have easily licked the plate clean.

I felt it was well worth the bill."}
{"text":"Nice place. I liked the good atmosphere, food is good but portions r too small. Clientele seem nice and classy."}
{"text":"This review is for people with food allergies. The chef is so good about accommodating any food allergies. I can't have tree nuts or sunflower seeds and have eaten here many times with absolutely no incidents. Charcuterie and wine are great, and the brunch is unexpectedly inventive. Very cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am really sad to leave a poor review for this place.  Most of the reviewers here love it. 

I really wasn't impressed here.  We got 4 things:

- Charcuterie platter. Fine.  Not mind blowing, not bad. The price was not low on this one. 
-Veal tataki with sweet breads popcorn.  Really excited about this but massive disappointment.  The sweetbreads tasted like sage or something and had a weird bitterness.  The tataki was fine but a bit tasteless.  There were mushrooms with too much vinegar.  I didn't finish it and no one else wanted to.  I saw someone across the restaurant struggling with it as well.  It was a lot of flavour in a bad way.

- Fennel lobster thing: the person who ordered it loved it.  I was indifferent.

- raw salmon thing - not bad. 

Wine list: good

Service: not that efficient at all. Had to ask for menu and wine list, had to wave for attention (we were at the bar).

Maybe it is simply a preference thing.  We don't all love the same stuff

I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Je suis allée dîner là-bas hier, c'est un restaurant que j'avais très hâte d'essayer et qui m'a plutôt déçue malheureusement.

Les points positifs: 

- un décor sans prétentions: serviettes en papier, menu à l'ardoise, etc...
- tout sur le menu a l'air bon
- les prix sont très abordables: entrée, plat et dessert à l'heure du lunch pour 20-25$ avant breuvages et pourboires.
- Mon entrée et mon plat était délicieux.
- Possibilité d'acheter leurs saucissons maisons pour emporter.
- En général, les présentations étaient très belles.

Points négatifs: 

- le service était absent et  peu souriant.
-  Alors que certaines présentation étaient magnifiques, certaines étaient tellement peu présentables que je n'ai même pas osé insérer les photos dans mon article sur mon blog (la boufferie)...
- les portions auraient été parfaites pour un 5 services, mais pour entrée, plat & dessert... je suis sortie de là et j'avais encore faim.
- Mon dessert était bon, mais il manquait un petit quelque chose... sûrement le foam de framboises et coco mentionné sur le tableau, mais qui ne s'est jamais retrouvé dans mon assiette....

Avoir pu mettre des demies étoiles, j'aurais mis 2.5."}
{"text":"Top notch.  Everything was excellent, but the house charcuterie plate was particularly notable; get this!  Even though the place was busy and we had no reservation, the staff were attentive, friendly and helpful, including with an excellent wine suggestion.  

Low key, high cuisine.  Absolutely worth visiting."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, having heard about the \"great\" charcuterie platters...honestly, I've had better and I've definitely been treated better.

We walked in for a quick drink and a bite after the theater and were able to get a seat at the bar right away on a relatively busy saturday night.

We ordered a glass of wine each and asked about the charcuterie plates - the waitress seemed bored and dismissively answered that the large had more \"grams\" than the small adding \"its not like me telling you how many grams are in it will tell you much\" - right. We asked if the small was enough to share and were told it was.

The charcuterie plate was nothing to write home about - 2 pates and some poorly cut sausage rings...

The kicker came when we asked the waitress for the bill and she informed us there was an \"issue\". They don't have a full liquor license so customers have to order food as well...since we ordered a plate we stared at her blankly...so she added \"no, you should have ordered one EACH\" then she went on to say that they make exceptions for those with reservations but we didn't have reservations so.... Not following her diatribe, we stared at her until she continued, \"but I guess no one told you and you're putting it on one bill so I guess its ok this time...but know for next time.\"

Know for next time? Last I checked, it was the restaurant's obligation to inform patrons of their policies, before they order; had she told us we needed to order a plate each we would have obliged. And what's the deal with making \"exceptions\" for customers with reservations only? Is my walk-in business not wanted?

I doubt there will be a \"next time\"."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. Had an amazing first time and a very-very poor second time. 

First time: 
Service and atmosphere amazing! 
Me and a girlfriend shared two appetizers (The large house made charcuterie platters and roasted beet salad). Both so delicious and presentation was great. The perfect balance of beets, cheese and meat. The plates and platter were spotless when she took them away. We shared a bottle of wine by her (the servers's) recommendation  (who was super friendly and personable and patient). 
Great time, definitely would return - especially to try the rest of the menu. 

Second time:
Atmosphere still fun and lively. 
Service was rude, impatient and intolerant of my cravings. 
Went with a gentleman friend for a drink and a sweet treat. My friend had a drink and I wanted just dessert. The server explained the \"law\" about not having a drink on it's own bill (and this is while we were ordering). Of course we understood and said we'll have one bill at the end of the night. She continued will insisting that I take a drink too \"since it is a bar\". Fine, I'll take a drink. 
And then she continued with explaining that we can't just take a drink and dessert, that we are \"required\" to also take food. 

Wait - What? She just said this is a \"bar\". I said, I will order more dessert - however she replied  that that is not considered \"food\". Okay then - let me start with dessert and I'll order more after. She approach us two more times (before our drinks or dessert had arrived) about what else I plan to order. I repeated, let me try the dessert first and then I'll pick something else. 

Drink was left untouched. The dessert (some lemon-lime crunch with goop) was no good. Combination of texture did not mix well  and the flavour was too mild. Server didn't check up on us- so how could I order more? 

I didn't finish the dessert (which is unheard of for me - I am self-proclaimed sweet-tooth). Waiting for service. No service. 
Grabbed the bill (from another employee) and left. Our server not in sight. 

What a disappointing second experience. Unfortunately, as much as I want to try the rest of the menu - I won't be returning. I regretted suggesting this place to my gentleman friend and now will avoid the place all together. 

I guess - enter at your own risk. 
Who knows what will happen."}
{"text":"If you live in Montreal, you are shit out of luck for one simple reason. There are very few good restaurants that are open on Sundays and Mondays. This is when we, foodies, are suffering from unbearable hunger and humiliation of eating regular food. However, those who look hard enough, will always find a solution. 

Welcome to Le Comptoir. My foodie retreat for Sundays and Mondays. While it might be way too packed/loud on thu/fri/sat, the ambiance is perfect early in the week. 

Food is awesome. Their octopus is one of the best I've tried in Montreal. Wine selection is decent. All dishes are $14-$20, so it is something in between tapas and regular restaurant meal size. You might want to order 3 things for 2 people. 

Their charcuterie plate deserves separate mention. The only place that competes with Le Comptoir charcuterie-wise is Bavette Chez Simone. However Le Comptoir kicks Simone's ass in mustard. House mustard is absolutely insane. I even bought couple cans for home use. Highly advised. You can literally spoon it raw, without anything else. And you won't feel bad about it. 

Other pros when you go to Le Comptoir on weekdays: 
-tons of free parking on St Laurent
-your ex will not find you there
-dishes are small-ish so you won't feel as bad for pigging out yet another day in a row

All in all - great place. See you there!"}
{"text":"Nice! Had a very nice aperitif and few bites before dinner later elsewhere. We liked the super friendly service. The menu is creative, fresh, and very well prepared. The wines, which I crave, are on the natural side, meaning the terroir stands out. Yum!  The portions are nice to share, especially on the counter, overlooking the busy kitchen. Lively and lovely for an evening start!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. If I have to find fault, it is likely the small portions that are served but considering their reasonable prices that's really hard to fault. The charcuteries appetizer was certain nice and beautifully presented. The main course including crispy pork and octopus were excellent and looked beautiful. The plates are right sized if you are planning on having three course and the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food that you are getting."}
{"text":"A bar owner recommended this place when I first arrived to Montreal. I didn't know at all what to expect, and because the place was packed, my entourage got a table with high bar chairs, that weren't very comfortable to sit on. The menu seemed odd at first, with some very unusual ingredients, but I ended up loving my cauliflower dish big time!

Trendy interior, very nice staff, and super delicious Dark & Stormy (drink). Not the most inexpensive place to have dinner in, but very cool."}
{"text":"This swanky and hip restaurant and wine bar was our first stop to eat after a long drive into town from Vermont on a Friday night.  Make sure you check out the photos, because the highlight, for me, was the charcuterie plate that was packed full of spicy Italian meat and pate deliciousness.  I can't recall everything else we ate, but the service was excellent and the server made some excellent wine recommendations for us.  

This place will fill up, so give yourself some extra time if you're arriving off the street during dinner hours, but that said, I thoroughly enjoyed our experience."}
{"text":"A great find! A relaxed ambiance, great meat dishes, at a fair price. A restaurant where tartare and pulled pork are not at the forefront of the menu, refreshing."}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant this weekend as my wife and I went for walk in the area.  The place looked charming and casual.  

We took a seat at the bar.   WARNING... It is an open kitchen and it might be very difficult to idly sit on the bar stool and watch the chefs prepare one great looking dish after the next.   After seeing the brunch menu come to life before our eyes, we selected 3 dishes.  The charcuterie platter, the terrine de Jarrett and the the ribs.  The charcuterie platter was my fav.   A very wide range of flavors and textures that delighted my senses.  The toasted thin strips of baguette wet toasted to perfection.   My wife ordered the terrine de jaret. The texture was not what I expected, but delivered on taste.  There are very complex flavors that are accentuated by the grain mustard and the celery root slaw.  My dish was the ribs that were topped with with a poached egg.  This was a very good dish that looks amazing but the taste paled in comparison to the other 2 dishes.  I will be returning with my wife so that we can explore the dinner menu.   

I would be remiss to not acknowledge the friendly service provided by our waitress.  And the chef also took time to describe some of the dishes he was preparing for the other tables as he noticed my extreme interest in some of the preparations.   

You guys are on my agenda the next time I am in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Effectivement peu de tables.qualite et service sans faille.a la mode.charcuterie qu'on peut emporter.le chef est fier de ne pas mettre de l'oignon dans ses desserts(voir la presse) belle expérience a répéter sans retenue."}
{"text":"On the Montreal dining and party scene, it's true that good things come in small sizes. The city's best restaurants, wine bars and clubs are most often small, cosy and hard to get into - a far cry from the Baton Rouges and Cheesecake Factories of this world. And Le Comptoir? Another, newer, case in point.

This place is hot - I had to call a few days in advance for a Sunday night reservation, and still, the only seating left was at the bar.  Fine by me, since the bar is in front of what's essentially an open kitchen where all the plates come together. Free food porn.

Le Comptoir exudes what I would call a \"nouveau Mile End cool\". It's not shabby-chic but rather manages to be modern and cosy without losing its edge. The menu is made of market-inspired tapas-sized dishes at reasonable prices. The wine list is equally friendly. Ask your waiter about it, he'll know what he's talking about. And chances are, he'll be cute.

We started with a dish in which an onion was cooked sous-vide (in sealed airtight plastic, in water, for a long time), and placed atop a \"tartare\" of bacon, smoked mackerel and marinated onion, topped with mizuna, a Japanese salad green ($8). The onion was cooked but still crunchy and flavourful, and was well paired with its taratare. Yum.

Next came the beet salad ($9) and the yellowfin tuna confit ($14). If you like beet salads, you have to try this one. It was made with red and orange roasted beets, celery, apples, watercress and argan oil, with a generous smear of goat cheese cream around the side of the bowl.

The tuna was also very tasty, and was paired with an aligot (potato and cheese) croquette and a vinigrette made of olives, capers and herbs. Delicious.

Our last savoury dish consisted of smoked duck breast with a croquette of confit duck leg and a caramelized onion purée ($17). The smoked duck breast and onion purée were delicious, but the croquette had too much potato filler - I could hardly taste the confit.  I was disappointed, and especially considering it's one of the most expensive dishes on the menu.

Finally, we ended with the chocolate marquise dessert, which was accompanied by with a light ginger cream, pieces of pineapple and a gingerbread cookie. Not too big nor too sweet. Mmmmm!

In all, this place is solid. For those who like specifics, here are the deets... The food is yummy and well priced, and the atmosphere is lively and urban-cool. It's perfect for an evening that's both upbeat and toned-down, where you can catch up with friends or enjoy a first date. The service, however, is somewhat unpredictable - two evenings gave way to two very different experiences. One waiter was uninterested and never came back for more drink orders while another one was super nice, helpful and attentive. And lastly, there's just one thing to remember - don't come after eating - each person has to order at least one plate to get a drink, since Le Comptoir has a restaurant, not bar, license. And that's all of it!

{"text":"I would would give a 3.5 honestly. The food was great. I had the shrimp ceviche with ravioli, fried cod and octopus. Ravioli was silky, good amount of stuffing. Cod was my favourite. It says fried, but it's not dipped in oil, there is a layer of friend crust on top with potatoe puree. The cod was soft, cooked perfectly. (I'm a seafood fiend!). The only thing was that there were thin slices of some sort of sausage on top of the cod which I didn't think needed to be there. The fish was amazing on its own and the toughness of the sausage kinda threw me off. Octopus was not bad. Something was missing from the dish, couldnt pin point what. But, it was cooked properly, it was tender, not chewy as i feared it would be. 

So, as I said the food was great, why 3.5 stars you say? The waitress handed us menus and disappeared for 20 min without checking to see if we were ready. When finally I found a way to make eye contact with her, we were able to put in our orders. The bread came after our first dish came out and then for dessert, I also ordered a coffee which came after we had completely finished our dessert. Very odd timing. I think she forgot about us a few times but before we could ask for anything, she remembered at the last minute. 

It was full house on a Monday night, but I do expect a nicer restaurant to have good service. But overall, good experience! I would definitely go back to try other dishes and for the COD!"}
{"text":"Others may have had spotty service, but I love this place. The food is among the best in Montreal that I've had, the effort that goes into preparing it incredible. The kitchen staff works hard and takes their work seriously.

Have to say that I had no idea they had a limited liquor license that requires each patron to order something with a drink. And my first stop here was shortly after they opened. I don't think I could ever stop in here and not be tempted to order a couple of the small plates with my glass of wine.

The charcuterie includes some great things, the house-made pates in particular. I've always liked their pickled veg as well. But the other plates are what really shine. Among the dishes we had was the beet salad, with a nice tang of orange, and the pressed lamb - exceptional. Our favorite this time was probably the Cotechino, a surprising and rich dish with caramelized pearl onions, beef & red wine sauce, and a lobster foam that the waiter recommended.

The asparagus salad also looked great, and the guys seated next to us ordered the octopus which they generously let us sample - cooked to perfection. That'll be for our upcoming visit.

While these are small plates, they're prepared meticulously, with tremendous attention to flavor and balance. They're good, filling servings. We've always liked sitting at the bar, where we can watch the staff work their magic, and where we've always wound up talking with those seated beside us. This is one of the spots we'll be returning to during our visit."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Saint Laurent there exists a marvelous tapas wine bar! Le Comptoir is a great place to get way from the typical St.Laurent bar/club scenario. With its cute, clean ambiance, Le Comptoir is a fun place were you can watch the staff prepare your plate which usually includes homemade charcuteries. Soooo goood!"}
{"text":"you got your head in the clouds

Le Comptoir is a charcuteries et vins bar, and it's very \"happening\".  It hold a promising title: \"One of Canada's Best New Restaurants\"

I was sadly underwhelmed, but that might have had to do with the mind-blowing meal (see le Quartier general) I had the night before.

Our dinner at Le Comptoir was still delicious, but I was neither blown away nor disappointed. I loved the vibe though. Laid back yet lively. 

The menu is a bit daunting, so I looked to the server for help.  When I asked him what his favourites were or if he could recommend something, he said, \"I don't know, that's hard\". I disagree.  To be passionate about food is to be secure enough to just say your opinion. There is never a wrong answer.  No answer means indifference.

My sister and I decided on the tuna.  It was beautifully plated and had a lot of potential.  It was such a perfect piece of fish but I wanted the dish to shine, it just flickered.

The short ribs were spectacular.  As for the charcuterie, it was fine.  But if you had Black Hoof's board in one corner, and Le Comptoir's in the other; the latter would be DOA."}
{"text":"We went for lunch but there was only a brunch menu being served. Regardless, we left so satisfied and hungry for more. We even considered coming back for dinner. The asparagus dish with prosciutto, egg, and lobster mayonnaise was fantastic. So many flavors that were spot on and cohesive. The spare rib sandwich was equally delicious. Even the bread and butter while we waited was fresh and generous in size. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food was (again) awesome. The homemade charcuterie on the butcher's block is awesome and tonight I also got the fried lamb square... So good and surprising because served cold!

Quite busy for a Sunday night, and I want to point out that you can buy wine by the glass... Always appreciated when you want to give it a try to multiple choices!"}
{"text":"The Spot:
Bringing a casual setting and price point to the Montreal French bistro dining experience, Le Comptoir Charcuteries et Vins offers up astonishingly inventive meals and lively atmosphere late into the evening in its open kitchen space on the corner of St-Laurent and Villeneuve. Drawing inspiration from the Italian enoteca, the restaurant caters to any diner's needs with an always-evolving variety of small to medium plates ranging from home-cured charcuterie to delicately poached fish, to a hearty beef short rib. Whether you walk in for an early dinner or a late bite, sit down at the long wooden counter with a friend or a loved one, order some wine, and sip it slowly while watching the staff labour over beautifully plated gourmet food. Once you see something that looks good, order it. Then order more wine to go with your meal. 

Eat, drink, repeat. You won't be disappointed.

What's Really Good?
Scan the tempting chalkboard menu, narrow your order down to a few choices, and then add a platter of Le Comptoir's home-cured charcuterie to begin your meal. Served on a wooden board with pickled vegetables and an out of control cumin spiced mustard that's also prepared in-house, the very generous assortment of sliced dry sausage, foie gras mousse, and cold cuts will start you off right. Depending on the night, you may be lucky enough to find some porchetta di testa on your board; this heavily marbled slice of rolled pork head is drizzled with olive oil and is so impossibly tender that it dissolves into salty, subtly smoky heaven the second it hits your tongue.

Almost all the prepared dishes will satisfy, but notable choices include a plate of roasted cauliflower served with anchovy puree and arugula salad, the very popular lobster tart piled high with chunks of choice lobster meat, sweet bread and green pea salad, poached mackerel with hazelnut butter... quite frankly it's almost impossible not to recommend a menu item here. It may be easier to choose a favourite, in which case I suggest the crispy pork flank with apples, coriander, radish, lemon foam, and barbecue sauce; the fatty pork and smoky sweet sauce play against the acidity and bitterness of the other ingredients, jolting all your taste buds at once with intense flavours that satisfy more and more with each bite until you're left with an empty plate in front of you and an almost inappropriate look of satisfaction spread on your face.

The restaurant's ambitious flavour combinations and sexy plating continue with dessert. Chocolate terrine with wine poached pears and masala caramel, Pineapple cooked sous-vide with white chocolate-filled coconut fondants and passion fruit gelatin, and goat cheese cheesecake with honey foam are typical choices. The chocolate terrine bursts with deep cocoa flavour, and the pineapple dish combines textures in a way that few restaurants in the city even attempt. An always-available cheese platter served with bread from Guillaume bakery offers a alternative to sugar and provides a great excuse to sample Le Comptoir's dessert wine selection.

You'll Wanna Know:
Unless you plan on stopping in for a late meal (After 10pm), make sure to call ahead. The laid back vibe and low prices (no dish costs over $20) make for an attractive combination and the restaurant fills up for dinner almost every night of the week. While the restaurant does offer group seating, the real show is at the counter; working up an appetite while observing the staff prepare your drool-worthy dinner is an unbeatable experience (it's also a great distraction, especially when the conversation with your date isn't flowing so well), and so Le Comptoir is best enjoyed as a one-on-one night out.

While dishes rarely disappoint, the slightly experimental nature of the cuisine makes for occasional missteps in the preparation of some ingredients; a crab salad that's since been removed from the menu came doused in an overpoweringly creamy dressing, and the wine-poached pears in the chocolate terrine dessert are too firm and undercooked to be served in that format. Also, while the wine list is very reasonably priced, the low-cost options aren't fantastic, so if you've come for good wine, be prepared to order something further down the list.

In addition to dinner every night, Le Comptoir offers a lunch menu from Tuesday to 
Friday and serves brunch on Sundays."}
{"text":"Finally I found a great place where I can proudly introduce to my dear yelpers in Montréal.  It's one block north from busy Mont Royal st on St. Laurent. Little new gem of Plateau Mont Royal! 

Before starting anything, 2 door down, there is a store named, Le comptoir d'ailleurs (4817 Blvd St. Laurent!) , so don't confused when you walk down the street.  This restaurant Blvd St. Laurent)  is little and there is no big huge sign hanging  so you have to open your eyes.  

The decor and ambiance are very casual; you don't have to dressy but they won't say anything if you come to eat with your sparkly dress after dancing at the night clubs down the street.  It reminds me of Ramen-ya in Japan; small open kitchen, busy chefs and cooks and counter (of course it's le comptoir! ) with Suppenküche in San Francisco touch( smooth wooden table and casual settings).

Food!  You have to , must order their homemade Charcuteries!  It was amazing.  Additional to that the homemade mustard, pickles, and the croutons are \"Absolutely blow your mind\"!!
I love blood sausages so I had to order the Boudin noir.  My husband ordered the pull pork sandwich.  It was lunch time so all of the plats come with your choice of soups.  The soup was delicious.  I wanted to take photos of the Charcuteries but I was so excited to eat I forgot that one but I got the soup photo :P  And again I got super excited for the main course. When I realized that I didn't take any photos, I already ate 90% of the boudin.  So you have to go there and find out yourself!   My husband sandwich was super hot and delicious.  I love when restaurant serves hot sandwich really \"HOT\" 

The dessert!  They have only 3 desserts but it's only $3 or $3.5 for little portion.  It was perfect for the lunch time.  They offer the lemon curd, pain perdu and apple tart.

They also has very decent nice wine list: If  you've been to Quebec, you already know that \"Any drinks with alcohol in it\" are super expensive.  We drank a bottle of Sancerre $46 and it was really good with the charcuteries and other plats.  

Ohohoh I forgot to tell you how \"reasonable price\"= cheap ($8-$15) :P  all the food is.  For the quality and quantity, it was great deal for us.  We can spend little bit more on wine since the food is so cheap.  


If you visit their Facebook site, you can see the hours and other informations.  It's all french but you have translator so use it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick drink before our dinner reservations elsewhere. As walk-ins on a Saturday night, we were able to get two seats by the window quite fast. Everyone else had to wait (HA HA!). Apparently you can only drink with an order of food since they don't have a full liquor license. However, we didn't know that and had already ordered our drink so they let it slide for us just that once. A+ for that! The food on the menu looked good for small bites with wine, I would definitely want to try it in the future.

10$ for a glass of good pinot noir, not the best, but good enough."}
{"text":"Après L'Appartement ce midi, ce soir c'est Le Comptoir!!! Beau petit resto bien au dessus de la moyenne. Un peu bruyant mais ça reste tolérable. Le menu est très originale avec l'oignon comme aliment vedette. Le Comptoir propose la formule trés à la mode des assiettes petits formats. Seul bémol, le choix de vin au verre est très limité."}
{"text":"Oh, like usual we came in like beavers that have never gnawed on a birch tree. We ordered the first half of the menu and then ordered almost the second half. All around votes for FANTASTIC! The Charcuterie platter was good, but could not outshine the other plates. Crispy pork belly, lemon foam, apples, radishes & cilantro----crisp and golden was the pork, the foam was just the right accent. Pressed pulled pork sandwich, pickle, old cheddar, bbq sauce---delicious, the highlight was the sauce, but we are pulled pork pros so anyone else would probably love it. The roasted cauliflower, anchovy puree, arugula, slow cooked onion, fried bread---the friend bread was a wonderful mini crouton sprinkled all over the plate, the anchovy heightened the flavor of the plate without tasting at all like anchovy, the cauliflower texture perfect. Roasted beet salad, celery \"a la grecque\", goat cheese, watercress, argan oil---was well done. Lobster tart, slow cooked onion, roasted tomato, tarragon, creme fraiche, arugula---the tart was a wonderful crisp disc, laying in the creme fraiche, tomato juice and tarragon topped by the rest. This was the ultimate dish for me, if my very expensive purse had a \"to-go\" container in side (this is something I'll have to work on) I would have ordered one to eat on the drive home. The lobster was perfectly cooked, as were the onions, there were savory and sweet tones to this dish, and the contrasting textures were just perfect. It's right up there with the kim chi bouillabaisse at Bistro Petit in Brooklyn. Roasted squash, creamy ricotta, \"ceci\", heart confit, lemon vinaigrette, mint---the heart was so tender and sliced just the right size, fried ceci beans can sometimes be very tough or hard, theirs were sublime. Asparagus salad, marinated morels, smoked duck marget & cold onion soup---this is one of two dishes that really stood out in the produce/veg arena, the mini morels were delicious, asparagus were crisp tender, tasted and looked fresh picked, they were the highlight of the dish which brings me to....Glazed sweetbreads, green pea salad, slow cooked onion, guanciale, arugula cream---the peas were again reminiscent of fresh picked, I am not a championer of the pea but these were fragrant with pea-ness, unlike other yelpers our sweet breads were not overly saged. White wine braised octopus, potato and creme fraiche tartlet, roasted onion lived up to the positive feedback others have left. The octopus was absolutely tender. We ended the event with Ganache au chocolat guanaja creme lergere au citron amandes roties meringue sechee & foam cassis, delicious although the crunchy bits took away from the wonderful consistency of the chocolate and fruit topping. Ananas cuit sous vide mousse chocolate blanc coconut gelee de fruit de le passion norsette, menthe. The pineapple was succulent but the best part was the coconut which reminded me of the horrid coconut covered marshmallows that I used to eat as a child; they were the way I always wished the nasty nubs of my youth would taste. 

Each of the six of us favored a different dish, none of us were disappointed by any. This restaurant was masterful at putting all of the right bits on a plate to concoct the perfect bite!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Amazing. Absolutely recommended. 

We rolled in early and without a reservation -- luckily we were offered a spot on stools near the front. Any later we probably wouldn't have been so lucky. 

Another point of luck was that there was an English menu available, which proved highly useful given some of the unusual ingredients present in the menu.

We formulated a plan that of course included a small charcuterie plate for the two of us, and three dishes after that which sounded good. But we decided to ask our server's recommendation (our server was terrific, btw, so we absolutely trusted him), which changed our order completely (except for the charcuterie, which is a must.) We ended up going with the Braised Onion with Mackerel, the Veal Tataki with Sweetbread (would NEVER have ordered this on our own) and the smoked duck.  All were spectacular.  Truly! And affordable! 

We didn't try any wine as we were on a bit of a beer bar tour and felt it necessary to stay with beer to preserve our well-being."}
{"text":"I cook food for a living, and if my food is half as good as these guys I'd be rich. Stop what your doing and get here quick. Small clean local delicious food. Delicious"}
{"text":"I dined here on a Monday night with a couple of girlfriends. It was very busy, even on this first night of the week, especially after 8.30pm. The crowd was trendy 30-somethings, which fit with the decor and the wait staff.

The wine list is very long but I was surprised to find so few of them offered by the glass. One of my friends was pregnant and the other doesn't drink much so a bottle was out of the question. I had only 4 choices in red wine, which I thought was exceptionally poor. I went with the Côtes du Rhône Coriançon at $7.50, which was a good choice, and I had two glasses.

I didn't try the house charcuterie, but I did see what the platter looked like. I hope it was the petite platter. We went straight for the \"main\". Both my friends had the octopus and I had the cod. We were all astounded at the stingy portions of the food. When you calculate dollar per oz of food, this place should not have a $$ rating but at least $$$-$$$$!

We were catching up so I didn't get to ask my friends about the quality of the food, but I didn't hear any ums and ahs. The description of my cod (poêlée, mousseline de fenouil & pdt, palourdes, peperone, échalote marinée, huile de paprika fumé - panfried, with mousseline of fennel and potato, clam, pepperoni, marinated shallots and smoked paprika oil) sounded delicious and distinctly more copious than what I got. I should have taken a photo. The cod was all of about 2 sq.in., and all the other ingredients but the mousseline sauce were on top of it. The mousseline sauce was all around it and, in fact, there was so much of it, it completely detracted from the other ingredients. In addition, the cod was a tad undercooked.

Despite having eaten two pieces of fresh baguette beforehand, I had another afterwards as I was still hungry. I thought I'd catch up with dessert. I ordered a tartelette à la framboise, ganache chocolat Nyangbo & fève tonka, noisette et citron confit. The tart measured no more than half an inch by 3 1/2\", and had a big dollop of ganache on the top, which was completely out of proportion to it and, once again, detracted from the flavours. I could taste the tartness of the raspberry, and the creaminess of a vaguely chocolatey ganache, but that is it.

As for the service, it was prompt but almost peremptory, polite but not exactly friendly.

I wouldn't recommend this place, frankly. I can think of better places to spend $50 on stingy portions and two glasses of wine. In fact, now I'm thinking about it, I'd rather like someone to explain to me how $18+$15+$8+tx even came to 50 bucks!!"}
{"text":"Defining the style of cuisine of this very wooden, well lightened and minimal bistro is quite challenging. You may have read that Le Comptoir was a Tapas place and now I read that is categorized as French. Actually, do NOT expect tapas in their classical small size but actual dishes more or less presented like tapases. 

The delicious flavors arising from the dishes will definitely taste French and Spanish mainly. First, do not miss the opportunity to get their \"charcuterie\" platter with the restaurant's own selection of meat. Then, you will have a hard time choosing your main dish given how mouth-watering they all sound. My recommendation goes to the \"boudin\" (flange) pie which paradoxically feels light and terribly tasty. But overall, you will feel that the cuisine is very personal and contains unique ingredients.

Le Comptoir also has a good selection of wine. Being on a budget, I went for the wine \"of la maison\" by the glass and found it pretty good given the pricing. 

Incredible food overall but I still have some concern regarding the service. You will notice that the kitchen is located behind the bar and provides little space for more than 2-3 cooks. Consequently, you might wait a little for your dishes even if the restaurant is not fully packed. But hey, have a glass of wine in the meantime and enjoy the pleasant atmosphere. Moreover, the service abides to its Plateaunic philosophy of snobbery towards anglophones. Try to come with a Frenchy."}
{"text":"Wow just had dinner here tonight and it was so amazing. I sat at the bar with full view of the open kitchen. Watching them prepare the food was like watching a pit crew in NASCAR. They were smooth and efficient.
The food was even more amazing!!

{"text":"Je note un peu sévèrement, mais c'est parce que mes attentes étaient très hautes, compte tenu de la réputation  très enviable du Comptoir, notamment auprès de mes amis.

Le staff est très gentil, la carte des vins est \"intéressante\" mais c'est surtout des \"petits vins\", des vins natures, des vins bio, des petites appellations. C'est correct mais il faut pas s'attendre à trouver des gros crus ou beaucoup de vins \"costauds\". Le hic, c'est le prix. Trop cher pour des vins de cette gamme, mais c'est un problème répandu à Montréal, bref, j'aurais aimé une carte moins convenue à cette pseudo-mode pédante et faussement originale qui semble contaminée tous les bars à vins. Ton vin obscur de la Loire, tu le payes 15$ et tu me le vends 55$.

La bouffe: Quand ta spécialité c'est les charcuteries, ton assiette de charcuterie doit absolument être au rendez-vous, ce qui n'est pas le cas. Assiette minuscule. Produits corrects... mais come on, je veux des charcuteries et je suis un ogre!!! Bref, c'est beaucoup trop timide pour moi vos 4 tranches de saucissons d'un millimètre servis sur une planche géante.

Le Carpaccio de thon était pas très bon, servi avec des légumes vinaigrés qui masquaient le thon finalement. Le coq cuit sous-vide était bien meilleur. Cuisson parfaite, belle texture, et bon assaisonnement. Les portions sont également à revoir. On mange ou on picosse?

De manière générale, la cuisine manque un peu de passion. trop précis, trop organisé, trop carré. Pas mon genre du tout. On voit que les cuisiniers se forcent et sont sérieux, mais quelque part c'est triste. Tout est retenu, calculé, pesé, minuté. Ça fait plus horlogerie que restaurant. Autre truc cocasse, chaque plat est décrit en long et en large, dans un style complètement exagéré. Du genre Carpaccio de thon servi avec son ketchup maison de tomates vertes biologiques sur salade de jeunes roquettes et biscotti aromatisé au thym de ma grand-maman, blablabla. Tout est effectivement dans l'assiette où se trouve 1 gramme de chacun de ingrédients. Le contraste entre la longueur des noms des plats et la très petitesse de ceux-ci à quelque chose de vraiment ridicule. Est-ce qu'on me prend pour un clown? 

Un autre irritant est le manque d'espace au bar. Oubliez l'idée d'y manger si vous faites plus de 160 lbs, ce qui n'est pas très gros finalement. Est-ce pour ça les petites portions? 

Musique: Vraiment à revoir. Mauvais. Mauvais. Mauvais. Indochine? \"Des Fleurs pour Salinger Wo ho ho ho ho\". Ouf! Plein d'autres tounes quétaines pour filles 25-35. Conseil. Si t'aimes vraiment ça, Indochine, peux tu nous faire jouer une chanson qu'on a pas entendu 10 000 fois à CKOI? Si t'aimes ça Neil Young, tu peux pas nous faire jouer quelque chose d'autre qu'Harvest Moon?! 

Crowd un peu prétentieux qui pense connaître ça, le vin, la bouffe pis la musique. Pas ma place, pas mon genre. Intéressant pour ceux qui aiment une cuisine très précise, les vins délicats et les diètes."}
{"text":"I love coming to Montreal for the food and culture. I just happened to be here on business and so glad I hit this spot. Great Charcuterie is so hard to get in LA and this place had GREAT charcuterie. Love it. Great service too."}
{"text":"Here are some things I look for in a wine bar:

- A relatively diverse list of interesting, lesser-known wines (i.e. not the same ones you see prominently displayed at the SAQ). Check. Bonus points: The list has mostly bio-dynamic, natural wines. I've found a great bottle every time I've been here. Most recently, an intriguing Sauvignon Blanc from the Loire.

- A good selection of food that pairs well with wine, ranging from light and small to rich. Check. My favourite is the roasted beet, Greek celery, and goat cheese salad, probably the lightest thing on the menu. Their homemade charcuteries are also amazing, it's hard to go wrong with the cheese, and my friends loved the lobster tarte (I tried a bite - delish, rich).

- Cozy atmosphere, good for relaxing and chatting. Check. Chalkboard-chic, modern décor.

- Good service, knowledge and friendly servers. Partial check. The service isn't always the most attentive, and can be on the slow side.  But I wasn't in any particular hurry and it didn't really bother me.

- Reasonable prices. Check. Not cheap, but reasonable in the context of Montreal, I would say.

All in all, Le Comptoir makes it into my list of top wine bars in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food and wine selection were simply amazing. The duck egg/heart combo was magnifique.  Knowledgeable wait staff. Great service."}
{"text":"Get the charcuterie plate! It's fantastic.

The braised octopus was nothing to write home about, but the crispy pork belly was delicious.

Great service, nice wine selection, tasty food."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience, friendly staff (we speak no french), great service, great food, great ambiance. Would return on our next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Très belle place. Nous étions assises au petit bar qui donne sur la rue, tranquilles :)
Vin très bon. Nous n'avons pas pris de charcuteries, mais des plats. Les avis sont partagés : mes raviolis étaient très bons ! Par contre, la sauce qu'il y avait sur la raviole était très farineuse, cela laissait un goût peu agréable. Fromages très bons.
Malgré tout, cela reste cher vu les proportions... les quantités dans les plats sont petites, je ne parle pas du fromage ! 
Gros mangeurs s'abstenir ! (ou venir avec la CB qui va bien)"}
{"text":"I dined here on my first night in Montreal. Being someone who loves Charceuterie & wine, I found it to be exactly what I wanted. Plus, I was pleasantly surprised by their offering of duck - I loved the duck ham & duck rillette. Also, top of the list for me was the beef cheek and burnt leek dish that comes with balsamic sauce & chimichurra sauce. The whole meal was very satisfying & I left feeling full with the two dishes & a couple glasses of wine. 
The service was great as well. It was a Monday night, so perhaps it's a less busy time of week."}
{"text":"If I owned a restaurant, it would be something very similar to Le Comptoir. I wanted to try this spot for a year before I finally got to and it didn't disappoint at all.

The food was served in the most ideal portion sizes so that I could get several dishes to try, but still have enough to get my fill of it and actually end up full without feeling ripped. The prices for the dishes range from 10 to 20 bucks and none of them disappointed. Every dish was interesting to say the very least and were all tasty. We tried A LOT... almost the whole menu (party of 2 only) including a repeat of the Pan Fried Cod. The Cod was the best dish of the evening. The flavors were subtle, but there was still a lot going on. It was quite a revelation in multiple ways. I always thought Cod was whack until I had it here. Always too flaky, dry, and overcooked, but not here. The clams were also really great too as I never really cared for them either before this dish. The Potato Mousseline with that Smoked Paprika oil was awesome too and the whole thing just came together beautifully. It's not heavy at all so you can go ahead and enjoy other stuff. 

Basically you really can't go wrong here with what you order. You can ask the servers or the cooks for recommendations as well since the cooks cook right in front of the bar which I think is awesome. They're really cool and down to earth, as are the servers/hosts.

The decor and overall ambiance of the place is what drew me here in the first place. It's so casual and classy without the pretentiousness and the ridiculous prices. I would so come here after work to have a glass of wine to go with some delectable food. Too bad I live in Los Angeles though..."}
{"text":"We walked in to Le Comptoir without a reservation, and we got a great seat at the counter, where we could watch all of the hipster-esque chefs cook beautiful dishes all night long. We watched them send out dish after dish, and everything looked -- and, more importantly, tasted -- delicious. We did not order the charcuterie, which was probably a mistake, but we did have the beet salad, braised beef loin, porchetta, and the shrimp ceviche. The shrimp ceviche was probably our least favorite, but we still enjoyed everything. They also had a great wine list with lots of approachable wines by the glass, and very knowledgeable waitstaff. A great dining experience all around."}
{"text":"This was the last stop on our culinary tour of Montreal. It's a smallish restaurant with a laid back and hip vibe. We chose to sit at the bar so we could watch the chefs cook our food. We were absolutely fascinated with their technique and perfectionism (especially since they were young guys who you wouldn't expect to be chefs at all). The dishes are tapas style. Between my boyfriend and I, we ate 3 dishes and a dessert and felt content (but could have definitely had more). We started with the sweetbreads which were amazing. So delicate and tender. I would highly recommend ordering these. We also got the pork belly which was tender and delicious as well. We finished with the lobster tart which was good but a tad too rich for my taste however still enjoyable. We finished up with the chocolate pate which was chocolatey and light. My only regret is that we didn't try at least one more item. Everything looked fantastic as we watched them cook. A lot of thought, effort and pride went into each complex and tasty dish."}
{"text":"Basically this is one of those trendy/tacky open kitchen restaurants to charge a little too much for what they give you.

The food is okay and the wine list is okay, I'm only giving it three stars because I just find it too pricey for what it is.

But I have to say I got fantastic service from the hostess. We walked in without a reservation, she took our name and number and we went down the street for a drink. As soon as a table opened up she called us and we came over quickly. Very cool!"}
{"text":"Lovveeddd it!
We wanted to go somewhere that had a nice interior, good vibe, and of course delicious food for our Montreal trip and this place was perfect.
We booked a reservation and came in around 9pm. Ordered a bottle of red, can't remember what but it was quite good. My boyfriend and I split 4 mains and it was the perfect amount of food. 
Cod w/ Potatoe Puree: The cod was perfectly fried and crispy on the outside and soft and fresh on the inside. It was surrounded by a potato puree je pense and some chili oil? Really good!!
Cotechino: It's some kind of cooked sausage/salami thing. It was definitely really tasty, but I guess I could've gone for something more adventurous.
Grilled Octopus: One large octo-leg, grilled well and soft on the side. 
Lamb w/ Pears: It didn't look like lamb, looked like more of a pork terrine type thing. I loved it though, it came with pears and a cream sauce.

Our friends got a couple things which I'm not sure I can remember well. One was the charcuterie which looked very cute. The meats didn't look particularly exotic and the portions looked small. Not sure if they were happy with this. Also they didn't seem to like the Tuna tartare dish and left half uneaten which cause the the waiter to scoff. He was nice up until that point, but that was weird. Also, it took almost 2 hours for all our food to come out so I had to take a point off. 

Would I be back? Might go back to MTL just for this..."}
{"text":"We went for dinner and it was truly amazing!! The staff was welcoming and the wine was wonderful. I had the sturgeon, Mom has the cod and my brother had the shrimp  ceviche all were perfect!!"}
{"text":"I cannot agree more with the guy before me. I had read about them in a local newspaper. I was blown away.

I always look for restaurants with great food, ambiance, well priced, and not too much pretension This one has it all. Add knowledgeable staff, and that unique touch of a restaurant that wants to do things differently, and you can't go wrong.

I highly recommend this restaurant. The outdoors look not so great but the interior is splendid, very stylish and cozy. Giving it a hole-in-the-wall gem added value. 

For 20$ I got a lamb shoulder on celery-rave purée with an assorted glass of wine. And i'm told that at lunch, you get an even better deal. Great view on the cooks for added entertainment."}
{"text":"Cadre très chaleureux et très sympa. Déçue par la minuscule. \"grande\" assiette de charcuterie. Pas mal mais pas renversant"}
{"text":"9 months later, we came back for the food.  And what an experience.  The first thing that came to mind was \"food porn\", but not the classy kind of porn... It's the raw edgy porn that you don't quite know what to make of.

So we sat at the bar, which is alongside the kitchen so you get to see how these guys work.  For 2 hrs we were completely mesmerized at the pace and precision.  Meat, spices, vegetables and sauces flew across our view with alarming speed.  I think we saw every single dish on the menu, made and plated.  If a dish was prepared even slightly wrong, or plated wrong, they threw it all away and started over.  A lot of pride in their work.

If you are a beef or pork lover (which I am not) then this place will be your heaven.  You can literally see how the sausage is made.  It was a bit unnerving to watch them pull huge trays of random meat parts out of the oven, drain off the fat into one bucket, and use giant tongs to put the rest into another bucket that got carried off for grinding downstairs.  Not sure how I felt about that part of the experience.

There were maybe 3 things on the expansive menu that didn't include beef or pork, so we had those.  A lobster tart, an almost raw salmon dish, and a cauliflower dish: all excellent, unique, and made with a variety of textures and flavors.  The salmon was the winner though.

While not the kind of place for someone like me to frequent, I can appreciate what I saw.  The chefs are friendly, interactive, and entertaining.  Sit at the bar, and you'll be treated to a dining experience like no other."}
{"text":"Nice joint with a fabulous wine list and an ever changing menu! If I could, I would opt for a taste of each item on the menu. Alas, one does need to make choices.The charcuterie plate is always a good choice and the crispy pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth delicious! 
Overall, this place is worth a try!"}
{"text":"Arrivés sur place on a eu un peu peur d'être déçus par un bar qui se voudrait un peu trop fancy mais nous avons été ravis de notre repas. 
Les plats sont au tableau, hier soir il y en avait au moins 12 variant entre 11$ et 22$. On sent la recherche dans l'association des différents éléments et aussi dans la qualité des produits. 
J'ai pris le tataki de longe de veau avec radis marinés et ris de veau frit. Un délice. Tout simplement avec une belle présentation.
Mon conjoint a pris de la pieuvre grillé avec chorizo et oignons sur une tarte fine de pomme de terre. Un beau mélange de saveur, les morceaux de pieuvres et chorizo sont conséquent ce qui permet encore plus l'appréciation du plat.
Vu la réussite des plats, on a tenté les desserts et là encore pas de déception. Mon dessert mélangeait les saveurs de chocolat blanc, nougat, orange confite et olives noires (!!!!) : Parfait! Je n'avais jamais gouté une si bonne association de goûts. 
Celui de mon conjoint était de saison fraise, rhubarbe, ricotta. Il n'en a pas laissé une miette.
Concernant les boissons, nous n'avons pas vraiment regardé la carte des vins. J'ai pris le cocktail signature La piscine et mon conjoint un verre de vin blanc.
Malgré qu'on ai passé une agréable soirée au comptoir à regarder les cuisiniers travailler et que les plats nous ont énormément plu, il n'en reste pas moins que les prix sont élevés."}

{"text":"I've been here a couple times while visiting Montreal and it's one of my favourite places for a nice dinner. Sitting at the bar is really fun so you can see everything being made and the service is great. Even when I came in last minute around 7pm one night they were able to find a spot for us. The food is delicious and interesting, I recommend the cauliflower and the octopus. I've also had the pork belly before and it's delicious. Spending an evening here trying out a few dishes makes for a great time."}
{"text":"Great food and wine selection! Beautifully plated dishes. I suggest sitting at the bar so you can watch the chefs and interact with them."}
{"text":"Nice to be back here early recently, walked in at 5pm with a reservation just in case, empty but started to fill up quickly all around us as we enjoyed our wine and charcuterie platter. 

The first glass I was served white wine in was stained with red wine which I only noticed over halfway through. Gave me a wee heebeejeebee but it was whisked away quickly with sincere apologies and didn't appear on the bill, so I recovered."}
{"text":"Our most memorable meal in Montreal two years ago, we enjoyed watching the chefs prepare our food from the counter. Started off with charcuterie board, followed by octopus, sweet breads and some sort of marrow that pretty much blew my mind. Enjoyed the entire experience."}

{"text":"We sat at the bar and had a very good value and excellent charcuterie plate, enough for two people at $15, no need for bread.  A couple of glasses of wine and some beet salad and we were full.  A small cute place with the customary great service you get in Montreal.  an extensive menu for brunch.
Unfortunately loud music which was too energetic for us for this type of meal."}
{"text":"5 star food, 4 star price, 3 star service, 3 star portions. Ceviche and dessert recommended"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you want to go back to as much as you can. 

A friendly staff will welcome you and, if you wish, be your guide through your culinary journey. 

Try to get a seat at the bar, you'll see your food (and everyone else's) being expertly prepared by the cooks as you're enjoying a glass of wine from their great selection.

Everything is always fresh and prepared to perfection. Seasonal meals and classics share the blackboard: the cauliflower, the octopus, the deer, the lobster pie all come highly recommended from this reviewer, but I've never tried anything I didn't like.

Don't miss this gem, you shan't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Delicious food.  All four of us ate every last bite!  Nice and cozy ambiance."}
{"text":"Le Comptoir offre une bouffe inventive et surprenante. J'adore ce petit resto pour plusieurs raisons. D'abord pour l'ambiance chaleureuse et le service. Ensuite, la qualité des plats servis est excellente. Le menu est varié, mais pas trop. La carte des vins offre une bonne sélection de rouge, de blanc, de rosé et de mousseux. 

Je vous recommande la pieuvre grillé et marinée au vin blanc, servie avec crème sûre et saucisson piquant. Un réel délice et un montage visuel qui donne l'eau à la bouche. 

J'enlève une étoile pour les raisons suivantes : les prix sont un peu trop élevés pour la quantité servi (malheureusement un problème courant dans ce genre de place). J'aurais aimé que ma portion soit plus généreuse. À 17$ pour une assiette principale, je m'attendais à un vrai repas. De plus, les places sont limitées, il faut donc réserver ou arriver tôt en soirée si on veut être certain d'avoir une table.

J'y retourne !"}
{"text":"I was traveling with my family and came across this sweet restaurant on yelp. As we don't speak French but the staff was extremely helpful, food was beyond delicious and had a great feel of a local vibe! I would most defiantly recommend this place for a glass of wine and/or dinner!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in Montreal.  We came early and sat at the counter to watch the head chef and I gotta say that guy's got his mojo on.  The food was precise, complex and delicious - and though it was a little decadent I felt perfectly satisfied after the meal. 
The weakness were the desserts, though made up for by their creativity."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was as well, but the kitchen's rhythm was quite off during our latest visit. First, the large charcuterie plate is immense, and is a great value. The cumin salumi was especially wondrous. Our vegetarian diner had the beet salad which was quite decadent. In terms of mains (small plates for the most part), our party had the sweet breads, pork belly, cotechino, cod, and the gigantic one pound pork chop. Everything was lovely and cooked to perfection with two caveats. First, the sweet bread portion was quite small, only coming with two glands. Second, the cod, which we were told was pescaterian, ended up being covered in salumi. That said, everything was decadent, and the massive one pound pork chop was especially glorious. Throughout the night, however, the kitchen had trouble preserving a good rhythm in bring about the plates, despite the restaurant being quite calm, and there were a few unfortunate lulls in our dining. To bracket the night, we had the carrot cake and the poached pear chocolate cake. Both were worth it. A note of advice on this place - you might want to pace your ordering, and order multiple \"main\" courses as the plates are quite small (save for the pork chop)."}
{"text":"We came here after an afternoon of drinking at dieu de ciel. We had a charcuterie board, sweetbreads, rooster with cranberry, and the cauliflower. Everything was delicious but the portions are very small so don't come too hungry. The prices are not that expensive but considering the portion size, it adds up if you order a lot of plates. The sweetbreads were outstanding so make sure you order them. Also one of the pates on the charcuterie board was amazing. We could have eaten a giant block of that. Although the wine list was long, only a few wines were available by the glass. While we really enjoyed one of the reds, the other one we ordered was very acidic."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Perfect food, great wine, cute set-up. The dishes are not too big, so you could easily have two each. It's hard to get a table for more than 2 people unless you reserve in advance, but sitting at the bar is perfect for a one-on-one dinner! You have to do the homemade charcuteries (the cotechino is to DIE for, and so it their cumin mustard!!) and they will offer you a new take on a beet and goat cheese salad - finally!! If you're feeling fancy, the lobster tart is amazing and make sure you save some room for desert!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Le Comptoir. Have tried it twice and it was an awesome dining experience. 

I tried roasted beet salad, glazed sweetbreads, pan-fried cod, albacore tuna carpaccio, eggplant & ground pork mezza luna and smoked yellow sturgeon. You def have to order the beet salad, a must. It's an explosion of flavours in your mouth.

For dessert, ivory chocolate ganache, which was heavenly. Also, strawberry panna cotta. This one was also delectable. 

Friendly, knowledgeable staff and excellent service as usual, open kitchen, chalkboard menu and great vibes. What else can you ask for?

THX Antoine!

PS They serve brunch on sundays. :)"}
{"text":"Le Comptoir was the worst dining experience I've ever had in Montreal.

I'm generally sympathetic to a restaurant even if there are significant flaws, but Le Comptoir, in my opinion, committed the worst offense: the staff were unapologetically antagonistic towards me and my company.

The good: This is really unfortunate because the food, decor, and overall presentation is great. I had a tasty pork sandwich that was very hearty, came with a punchy BBQ sauce, charred just the right way, and exquisitely presented.

The bad: I made a reservation the day before and we showed up 5 mins late, but given that more than half of the tables were vacant, it did not seem to warrant any concern. Nonetheless, our server was immediately rude, gave us a bad table, ignored requests, reprimanded us for splitting the bill, and proceeded to chat with her coworkers for a full 15 minutes AFTER she saw us signal to her for attention.

What it came down to: we're Anglo, they're not, and they absolutely did NOT want us there. Our server insisted on speaking French throughout, which made ordering awkward for a few of us. As an American living in Montreal, I recuse myself from Franco-Anglo frictions (alleged or actual) and I'm not offended by some haughty, card-carrying sepratist, but what I think is patently unacceptable is poor service!

We headed over to Kem CoBa after for a treat and to wash down the bad taste that was left and all was mended!"}
{"text":"Oh this place is more like a 4.5 stars! If only their espresso was better (it's a tad bit on the terrible side)... The food is amazing. The open kitchen is wonderful, and you have a front seat to the kitchen at the bar. We were there when someone was being trained, and it was nice to see a patient chef teaching someone his techniques. The dessert was not bad, but a little too sweet. This place is absolutely wonderful for a small romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing wine! Thanks for making our first meal in Montreal one to remember"}
{"text":"Great food:  The octopus was the most tender I've ever had (including an awesome pulpería in Barcelona).  The agnoletti was delicious.  But, the sweetbreads were in small pieces and then breaded, which I think makes them a bit boring.  The service was great, and the waiter made a good wine recommendation."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I arrived to our AirBnB in Mile End only two hours before the symphony. Short on time, we hopped to this place and it was special.

Fabulous, small-plate menu with intuitive yet interesting flavor combinations, good prices for value, and wonderful, warm staff.  Despite not having a reservation, we were served with grace and friendliness."}
{"text":"Bel endroit, bons vins, bons plats + bonnes charcuteries ! J'y retournerai !"}
{"text":"It's official: Mile End/St-Louis has become a true wine-lover's paradise (at least by Montreal standards) in the span of just a few short years. Le Comptoir is the latest addition to the scene, having opened in the fall of 2010. The concept is minimal: a simple, tasteful interior; a relatively short menu that places the emphasis on snacks and smaller, informal dishes (like a house recipe BLT, made with house-cured ventrèche), but also includes some more elaborate fare (including a killer côte de porc for two); and a nice selection of wines, focusing on natural, biodynamic wines. Le Comptoir prides itself on its charcuterie, all of it made on premises, and they have good reason to--their selection of saucissons secs, guanciale, coppa, and other cured meats ranks among the city's best.  In many ways, the concept is very close to Buvette Chez Simone.  Both have paired a smart, appealing, and affordable menu with a smart, appealing, and affordable wine list (wines by the glass are all under $10).  Buvette has done gangbusters business pretty much from Day 1.  Le Comptoir appears to be poised to do the same."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Fantastic atmosphere. Lots of fun to watch the chefs make your food in front of you. The desert lemon white chocolate ganache on top of a black olive purée is too delicious for words!  The contrast of sweet to salty is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Je suis rendue hier soir au Comptoir, restaurant dont je n'avais entendu parler. 
A l'arrivée, impression hyper positive, la deco et sobre mais chic, des tables en hauteur, une cuisine ouverte. Le menu sur l'ardoise est alléchant mais déjà je tique...
Quand un plat est decrit sur 3 lignes, ça annonce quelque chose qui se la raconte pas mal mais pas toujours à la hauteur de ce que cela évoque.

Et voilà, je ne me suis pas trompée !
L'assiette arrive et moi qui ait un bon coup de fourchette... catastrophe ! Ca ressemble à une assiette d'un restaurant gastronique, c'est `s dire, pas grand chose à manger. Que cela ne tienne, si c'est bon, cela m'ira parfaitement.
Bon, ben, c'est recherché, extrèmement bien présenté mais ca manque de gout, vraiment. C'est prometteur mais ca manque de saveurs.
Meme chose pour le dessert. C'est beau mais pour le coup, ma \"ganache chocolat ivoire, coriande, pistaches grillées, compotée d'orange amère et airelles\" était bien trop petite et bien trop sucrée... D'ailleurs elle était où la coriande ?

Donc oui, le rapport qualité prix est correct (16$ pour mon céviché de crevettes - 9$ la ganache) mais les portions auraient été parfaites pour un 5 services..."}
{"text":"Peu de choix pour les brunchs de fin de semaine.
La nourriture est de qualité mais en petite quantité.
On reste un peu sur notre faim après le repas."}
{"text":"Déçu. Le menu avait l'air très alléchant, mais le goût était moins qu'ordinaire sans compter que le prix était élevé par rapport à la quantité de nourriture et la qualité des repas.

Attention menu changeant: nous nous sommes fiés aux images dans Yelp, mais le menu peut varier selon les saisons. Le menu est au babillard.

En ce qui a trait aux vins : bonne sélection de vins Français. Je doute par contre des vins vendus au verre dont le goût est complètement vinaigré pour deux types différents que j'ai essayé. La serveuse me mentionne que c'est un style particulier pour un vin \"organique\" ou \"naturelle\". Après le 2e type de vin avec un goût similaire... j'ai arrêté de questionner. Tout de même, une grenache qui goûte comme un jus d'orange passé date... je ne suis pas certain que c'est recherché!"}
{"text":"1er impression en rentrant, décoration et ambiance décontracté, on s'entendait parler sans trop forcer ce qui est rare à Montréal. Le nom comptoir charcuterie et vins, nous faisait rêver, et on s'attendait à une avalanche de charcuterie, malheureusement le plateau de charcuterie (le grand) nous as vraiment déçu, pour 15$ on a droit à 10 tranche de saucisson microscopique, des morceaux de terrine/pâté dans le même ordre, et un peu de pancetta. La charcuterie est ici principalement un accompagnement dans les plats et non la pièce maîtresse vraiment dommage. On a quand même continué avec un plat (pieuvre, magret ...) tous délicieux et un plateau de fromage très goûteux, mais encore là on se retrouve avec des portions microscopique. Du côté des vins, rien à dire la carte est fourni et le prix aussi. On a pris un blanc de la Loire pour accompagner le repas, très bien conseiller par le serveur. Côté prix compter 60$ pour un repas complet avec du vin. Au final on aura passer un bon moment mais il faudrait améliorer les portions pour que le rapport qualité/prix soit honnête, et mettre la charcuterie brute plus en avant."}
{"text":"With the amount of time I spend dining out, I have found managing expectations is the key to satisfaction. Some expectations are obvious, I mean, no one's expecting coq au vin from Buffalo Wild Wings, but unfortunately, my high expectations of Le Comptoir Charcuteries et Vins fell very short. 

The small, open kitchen restaurant was alive with many diners who appeared to be having a good time, which built up my expectations even further. We began our dining experience with the house made charcuterie. For a place with Charcuterie in the name, I was expected more than flavorless, fatty sausage and overly salted cured pork. The small glimmer of hope came from the nicely pickled onions and wonderfully-spiced mustard. 

Next, we ordered the white-wine braised octopus with chorizo and cream. The octopus was the shining star of the night, perfectly tender with a nice essence of the wine. Sadly, the other elements of the dish lacked balance with the abundance of salty, overpowering chorizo and heavy portion. 

Finally, we order the Veal tataki with cornmeal-fried \"pop-corn\" sweetbreads, enoki mushrooms, and sage purée. Unlike the octopus, there was nothing restorative on this plate. The piercingly acidic sweetbread buried under seasoned mushroom and olive oil drenched veal, toped with an overwhelmingly bitter sage puree. One word: yuck!

In short, the dishes were complex with untraditional pairings; sadly the lack of balance left it was obvious the chef did not take the proper time for development."}
{"text":"I threw my bike in the car and drove the 5.5 hours up to Montreal from the NYC area to spend a couple of days eating, drinking and looking at art (the Peter Doig show at the Fine Arts Museum is, in my opinion, worth the trip..).  

This past Wednesday night I had drinks at the amazing Plan B on Mont-Royal.  The bartender recommended Le Comptoir and claimed it was the best thing going in Montreal at present. 

 I can't really speak to that, however I *can* say that it was the best thing *I* have experienced in a LONG TIME.  Why was it the best?  After all, I live just outside NYC and NYC is nothing if not a foodie town.  

Well, the extraordinary combination of location, ambiance, menu, ingredients, quality preparation and plating/presentation.. 

The restaurant is located in a seemingly hip part of Montreal with lots going on day and night.  
The ambiance- I stopped in around 9pm.  The place was very full of lively people in their 30s and up animatedly talking and eating and oohing and ahhing over the dishes being presented to them by the waiters/cooks - yes - that's the other cool thing about this place - as far as I can tell, the person who takes your order and discusses the menu with you may be the same person who goes back to the open kitchen behind the counter and prepares your meal.  

The lunch menu is up on chalkboards facing the counter and the seating area.  the dinner menu is on a card that you're given, with the wine list, when you sit down.  The night I was there there were about a dozen dishes on the dinner card and it was difficult to decide - sweetbreads or octopus or squid or beet salad or pan roasted cauliflower... ??

I ordered the cauliflower which was served with anchovy mayo, arugula, slow cooked onion and fried bread (croutons, basically).   I also ordered the white wine braised octopus, potato and creme fraiche tartlet with chorizo and toasted onion.   But were really quite delicious.  Gillian T. gave a 2-star review complaining about the portion sizes given the prices of the dishes and, you know, I can't say she's wrong.  My bill turned out to be $50 CAN for the 2 dishes, 1 very small glass of very delicious white wine, tax and tip which did kind of seem a lot -- even though everything was SO DELICIOUS. 

All in all it was a great dining experience which I would (and probably will) repeat - however, Gillian T is correct that this place should be in closer to the $$$ category given the portions which are beautifully prepared and plated yet kinda modest in volume."}
{"text":"Over the past few months, I came across a number of glowing reviews on this new restaurant in many publications, whether in La Presse, The Gazette or the Montreal Mirror. Knowing that my girlfriend and I pretty much have an obsession with saucisson sec (having spent my childhood in France will do that to you!), this was on top of my must-try list. I was just waiting for a good occasion to go. Last night was the night and boy was I not disappointed!

The place has that modern bistro feel--chalkboard menu, and an open kitchen. Because it is pretty noisy, it's not the first date type of resto. We sat by the bar and the chef came to chat with us and described us the menu. Very nice fellow...actually the whole staff was very friendly and helpful.

We were literally blown away by everything that we tried. I love how the chef can make delicious dishes with simple ingredients...I mean everybody can make something delicious with lobster and foie gras. An example was the pasta with braised pork kidney that we had. So comforting! I cannot forget the plate of charcuterie... melts in your mouth!

Will definitely come back as it has become our favorite restaurant in Montreal"}
{"text":"Que ca soit pour un 5 à 7, un souper entre amoureux ou un brunch d'amis, le Comptoir Charcuteries et Vins est à recommander.  Faisant partie du top 10 restaurants du Canada par En Route, le Comptoir offre bien sûr des charcuteries et du vin en plus de plats créatifs et oh combien goûteux.  Leur charcuterie est absolument à en tomber à terre, vieilli sur place et utilisent toutes les parties du porc. Chacune d'entre elle se démarque par ses épices et assaisonnements soigneusement pensés par leur chef.  Les plats se partagent bien et sont simples tout délivrant sur la saveur! Leur desserts sont également définitivement à essayer! Surtout leur riz au lait, soyeux tout en étant un peu croquant sous la dent avec leur pistaches caramélisés!  Et leur brunch est vraiment intéressant avec des choix qui sortent de l'ordinaire! Mon coup de coeur: leur boudin avec un oeuf pané et coulant à l'intérieur... mmm... J'adore j'adore j'adore le Comptoir!!!"}
{"text":"It's my favourite and most memorable meal in Montreal. 

All seasonal and mostly local ingredient are made from scrap in the kitchen. Eat healthy and in season if you called yourself \" eating healthy \"

Slightly Baked Pear salad with blue cheese and nuts on top...it's almost a warm salad. Very soothing and welcoming for a Sunday brunch. Sweet, juicy, with note of blue cheese add the layer intensity. 

Beef Tongue egg Benny...you heard me right! Sliced beef tongue with egg Benny, just go an try it. Lobster egg Benny is overrated, and salmon egg Benny is always classic. 

My love  is the Pork Belly little Pasta with Porched egg & parmesan cheese ...Pork is Roasted perfectly that taste almost like steak. Fresh made little pasta( I believe it's a homemade pasta, if you ever made a pasta by yourself, you can taste the super freshness and chewy texture in it) and caramelized onion all together with beautiful onions petals & Porched egg on top! 

Coming back already"}
{"text":"Went in for dessert with a friend after a dinner party down the street and was not disappointed. We split the chocolate ganache and chocolate terrine--no such thing as too much chocolate. The ganache was white chocolate with a hint of lemon--my fav of the two. Will definitely be returning for dinner!"}
