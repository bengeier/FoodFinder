{"text":"Went here tonight on a spur of the moment as we needed something in this area but wanted a \"classier than the average\" place. I was not disappointed. It was after 8 with no reservations. Arrived and it was half full. We could not decide to sit in or out so the host suggested \"half and half\". He placed me and my friend inside but by these large roll up doors with the terrace in front of us... Perfect! The air was fresh yet my lady friend stayed warm. The resto is mid size (small during winter without the terrace) and the decor classy/elegant for this area.   A decent wine list (I am no expert) and the staff is super nice. Our server was top notch (argh, forgot her name) and checked on us slightly above normal. We ordered the Spinach Salad, Lamb and Butternut Squash Risotto. Wow! Hands down one of the best Risottos out there. The salad with pears, almonds and Blue Cheese stuffed figs was also memorable.   There were a few over items on the menu that I will need to go back for. I am really surprised this placed was not reviewed here. A keeper."}
{"text":"Menu is varied, service excellent, place is fairly quiet and has no kids menu which invites people to leave their kids at home ( a good thing, this is not mcdonalds...)   I had the mushroom and truffles risotto, it was great. If I have to criticise the risotto, it had slightly too much butter to truffles ratio which got on my stomach quickly and made me unable to finish the portion. I Also had the poutine trio, the best part was the deep fried polenta poutine. My friends had the filet mignon and chicken supreme, everyone loved their food. Filet mignon looked fantastic, I will try it next time.  Wine choice is good but very expensive, makes you long for a BYOB formula rather than SAQ+50% markup.  We didn't save room for dessert."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and of high quality. Service is great! The staff is very friendly and polite! They make you feel special!"}
