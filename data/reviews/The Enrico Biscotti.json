{"text":"We went to the pizza making class.  It was amazing! There was so much food that we could hardly even eat our pizzas, which was not a problem because they had boxes to take yours home. Wonderful history lesson, delicious food, a very intimate setting, and some fun characters. All in all well worth it!"}
{"text":"Split a pizza and an order of arancini with my daughter. I wasn't blown away by the pizza (she was-- I thought it was good but not great), but wow, the arancini were fantastic. They came with a creamy curry sauce instead of typical marinara-- so good. We then went into the bakery next door and got sfolgiatelle for dessert. Now, I am a sfolgiatelle snob (grew up eating them from a great Italian bakery in Western Mass.) and these were tiny but very very good. Now if they would only make pasticiotti."}
{"text":"I have never formally eaten here. As in, I have never dined in the restaurant portion.

But ever since I was an undergrad at Pitt in 2002, I would come to Enricos for the macaroons.

To this day, when I am in town for a visit, I stop in.

Why? Because Enrico's makes the most perfect macaroon. It's heavy on coconut flakes, yet gooey. It's a macaroon miracle.

The other pastries I've sampled are equally wonderful. I guess it's time to venture down the side alley and check out the restaurant.

Kudos Enricos!"}
{"text":"The cafe here is a delight.  We had a very nice lunch in the outdoor area.  We had our dog along and they welcomed him with a bowl of water.  We were given tastings of several wines to help us decide what we wanted by the glass.  The food was fresh and tasty.  Service was friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. Everything is great. Service is friendly and prices are a bargain."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. It feel like and i think it might be a family owned treasure. I love the atmosphere and the food. I had the pesto pasta for lunch and my sister has the Al Forno pasta and they were both fresh and amazing. They make their pasta in house so it was wonderful. I love the small town feel and food. Excellent."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. I didn't mind waiting for a table since it's a small restaurant. And while the wait for food took 45 minutes, I appreciate that freshly made meals take time, and the restaurant was busy. But I did mind waiting for things like, forks, napkins, someone to wipe the table after the previous diners left. Asked for a drink 3 times before it came. Filthy bathroom. I really wanted to like it since I heard great things about it. But the busboy, waitress, and kitchen just weren't in sync. Has great potential, cool space, great menu. Just failing on the basics."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere.  Good customer service.  I had the roast pork loin with side salad for a very reasonable $9.95... and would recommend it.  One of the better food experiences in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday on Saturday. It's a very cozy place, small and warm. They were full so my family and I waited a bit. While we waited we ordered a bottle of Chianti and the owner himself made us a pizza while we waited, on the house, to make the wait easier. A wait that was very worth it. The food is delicious- amazing salads and pizza and pasta ( al dente). Delicious bread. It was my mom's birthday and they treated her so nicely by giving her a few desserts on the house. She lived in Tuscany for 9 years as did I and we all agreed the food and ambiance are legitimate. The owner is very friendly. Overall a 5 star experience!!! Can't say enough good things about it."}
{"text":"Love biscotti? Go.
Love the smell of fresh baked italian cookies and bread? Go.
Indecisive when choosing flavors? Good luck!

I'm Italian, so I know a real biscotto. This place has it down to a science. Absolutely incredible and 32 flavors to choose from. 

Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, Banana Nut, Oatmeal Raisin, Black Forest Cake...the list goes on and on and on. 

Great prices, too, for fresh baked goods. Hell, they should charge for the smells!

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the second year we have hosted a private dinner function here and I immediately remembered why. The service, atmosphere, and most importantly the food. You can't miss, we will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at Enrico's.  We've had lunch before but this was our first breakfast.  They do a great brunch on Saturdays from 7AM to 11AM.  The food was magical.  This is clearly the best kept breakfast secret in the Strip.  No wait here as we walk by Pamela's and Deluca's with lines running down the street.  

The menu was great and both Catherine and I had trouble deciding what to order.  Catherine had the Egg Strata and I had a rustic egg and aged meat pastry with and beautiful flaky crust.
We both had slices of their thick cut bacon.  LaPrima coffee was excellent.

Ambiance was perfect - old strip location made me feel like nothing has changed since the 40s.  Feel of authentic Italian cafe (not that I've ever been to Italy!).

We will be making this our regular Breakfast stop in the Strip."}
{"text":"Amazing smells! Great little italian bakery. Got a classic biscotti and a key lime scone and both were delicious!!"}
{"text":"We had their macademia white chocolate  biscotti's at an outlet in the airport. Easily ranks among the best biscotti's I've had."}
{"text":"Ridiculously nice staff. When I asked if they had hot chocolate, I was told that while it wasn't on the regular menu, they'd make some for me anyway. We were sitting at the table that's practically in the kitchen, so I go to watch our server-chef chop off a chunk of chocolate, melt it, pour in milk and cream, and steam it up. The result was surprisingly light and frothy. Yum!"}
{"text":"I think their pasteries used to taste better before , wish if they let you buy smaller pies or a piece instead of the whole thing"}
{"text":"I was finally able to try Enrico's out for lunch. It was a warm summer day and it was pretty hot and humid inside, but what can you expect with a hot pizza oven inside the restaurant. They serve wine! I ordered the sweet wine, which wasn't very sweet and was served warm. The pizza I chose to get was quattro formaggio. The dough was chewy and not crispy, which was fine. I think the cheese weighed down the crust because there was a lot of grease on that pizza. The gorgonzola used on the pizza was a bit on the sweeter side and was delicious. I think next time I will try the pasta. Oh and make sure to stop inside and get dessert. So many delicious flavors of biscotti and other sweet treats."}
{"text":"These folks are awesome!  Not just great biscotti, it's all fantastic.  Everyone us incredibly nice, a real local Pittsburgh business doing it all the right way!"}
{"text":"Don't blink and bypass this awesome cafe sandwiched between two buildings!   Incredible gourmet pizzas and more.  It's an old authentic shotgun structure with tons of character."}
{"text":"Scott Baio was here! 
This is where the delightful little movie \"The Bread My Sweet\" starring Scott Baio was filmed.    The movie was renamed \"A Wedding for Bella\" when it was released on video.
The biscotti here are awesome because they are fresh and soft, rather than hard and crunchy."}
{"text":"I'm new to Pittsburgh, so I went down to the strip this morning and had breakfast at DeLuca's, did some shopping at Penn Mac and was planning on trying biscotti at Enrico's.  I love biscotti and was hoping to be a regular customer.  Unfortunately the awful customer service stopped me from buying anything and ever returning again.  My car was parked in front of the store while they were hosing off the sidewalk.  Keeping the place clean is very respectable and when they were done they should have taken two seconds to hose off the side of my car which was now covered with dirt.  Unfortunately they did not hose it off.  The guy with the hose was still outside and watering plants so I go inside the cafe and explain to the guy behind the counter what happened and if he can please use the hose to spray the car.  He looks at me like I am crazy.  Another employee goes outside and asks the guy to hose off my car who then says it will be five minutes and calls me an asshole.  They get dirt all over my car and dont wash it off and the guy is still outside and easily could take two seconds to wash it off, but wont and I am the asshole.  Nice way to treat your customers."}
{"text":"Love this place...truly a hidden gem as it is tucked behind Enrico's bakery, a little bit off of Penn Ave.  Makes me want to be in Italy, at a cafe, having an afternoon-long lunch with good friends and plenty of wine.

The food is really delicious - high quality, fresh ingredients.  The sandwiches come on incredible bread. (Gotta check out the bread baking classes...) The salads are great and lightly dressed.  My favorite lunch combo is the beans and greens along with an arugula salad.  With the bread and olive oil that they give you to start, it makes the perfect light lunch.  Stop in the bakery on the way out for a biscotti or a coconut macaroon."}
{"text":"By far the best coconut macaroons on the planet! Eating just one is like eating a meal. Come early when they are fresh out of the oven and still warm. The gorgonzola cheese and mushroom pizza is also to die for.  I can't wait to take the Sunday morning baking class here"}
{"text":"Excellent biscotti, lots of favors. Shop is tiny, but has an alleyway cafe next door as well. $9.00 for a half dozen, but they are large. Lots of great flavors. Parking can be difficult - street and pay meter."}
{"text":"Love the little, hidden away cafe. Great food and wine!"}
{"text":"This review is for the cafe only. The bakery looks really good and I will be sure to post an updated review once I've tried it.

I occasionally come here for lunch as I work nearby in the Strip District. It's located slightly off the main Penn Ave drag and has a few cafe tables situated in a sweet little alleyway and then a cozy cafe lies just beyond that. They've apparently begun producing wines; I tried a white and it was very raw tasting. I do admire their creative and entrepreneurial spirit, however!

Their pizzas have a tasty, thin, wood-fired crust. The margherita is just OK, with a minimally or un-seasoned San Marzano tomato base, a few slices of fresh mozzerella cheese and (twice this has been presented to me this way, so I assume it is a conscientious preparation decision rather than indicative of a shortage) about three small shards of basil. I ask for parmesan and that makes it more palatable. But truly, this is a spartan sort of pizza. I think they need to amp up the ingredients.

Service seems fine."}
{"text":"Great place!  Stop in here a few times a year and it is always very good.  We usually do breakfast, but we were running late and did lunch instead. We had \"Sanga weeches\" that were great!  The bread was basically fresh pizza dough folded over and it was perfect, I mean perfect!  The flour is just that perfect golden brown, and almost black, but not burnt black, just perfect black.....  You know, this guy nailed it!  It was an Italian with ham salami greens cheese etc., and even though it was a simple Italian sandwich, it was a simply perfect Italian sandwich!

The on.y reason this wasn't a five star is the price is a smidge steep, and the portion size can und be a smidge bigger, but those are both just small smidgen....  For most people, the size might have been just right.  Service was great, and Enrico is always there, and he is always fun, even when crazy busy, this place is a classic that you must try when visiting the strip.  When you are done with ouch, grab a few biscotti on the way out from his bakery right next door.  

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after finding it on Yelp. It was our first time in the Strip District and this place did not disappoint! We did not eat at the cafe, only purchased biscotti to go. The man who waited on us was helpful and was able to make flavor recommendations. We brought home lots of delicious biscotti and even though they told us it will keep for weeks in a brown paper bag, I doubt it will last that long!!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the restaurant behind the bakery, as well as the bakery itself.

Enrico's has been one of my favorite parts of Pittsburgh since I was a kid. I have very fond memories of going here with my family around the holidays. There's something so perfect about eating in this narrow, cozy kitchen hidden in an alley. It's always loud in a good way, and the service is usually great in a no-nonsense kinda way. The owners are usually milling about to check on you and make you feel at home. I'm all about the ambiance at this place -- it makes me feel like I'm back in Italy.

The food is also consistently great. Their sangaweeches -- sandwiches of Italian meats, cheeses, and greens wrapped in freshly baked pizza dough like an Italian taco --  are always delicious. They have wholesome soups in the winter and excellent giant salads full of nuts and berries and cheese.

Though I've never gotten the chance to drink it, I know they get rave reviews on their wine. I have, however, tried their baked goods sold in the store upfront. I've had some of the best cookies and macaroons of my life from this bakery. Anything with chocolate is a must.

I cannot recommend this place enough -- if you're in the strip district and you need a quick, hearty, AWESOME lunch, this is your place. Trust me."}
{"text":"EB is a tiny bakery hidden on Penn Street in the Strip. If not for the sign and the smell of baked goodies, you might actually miss it. 

Upon entering you are overwhelmed by the sights and smells. Tons of glass jars layered row upon row with fresh baked biscotti. My favorites are the vanilla with milk chocolate and milk chocolate drizzle. Om nom nom. You can't go wrong with their monstrous macaroons. They are piled high with coconut and they even have some dipped in chocolate. EB has lots of fresh breads to choose from as well. 

Every time I'm in the Strip, I make a point of hitting up EB for a little treat."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch and ate on the outside dining area. It was very quaint. The food was out of this world! We shared a chicken sandwich (which was made like a fold over) and a pepperoni roll. Our waiter was less than attentive. The owner, however, spent time chatting with us which made for a pleasant experience. we purchased biscotti to share with others back in Ohio however not many made it as we ate them on the way home!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because of the cafe. Let me begin by saying I am a garbage disposal. I will eat anything at anytime but found myself not wanting to finish the Margarita pizza or pesto chicken sandwich. I tasted more textures than flavors but then again I have a haitian girlfriend so I am used to her food being flavor explosions in my mouth. We left more than half our food on the table. The ladies next to us got the fig pizza and said it was delicious and it's all they ever get. I will have to give that a try if I ever return for the cafe because it did look delicious. On the other hand, the biscottis are to die for! The gentleman helping with the biscottis was beyond generous and helpful. If you go for the sweets be sure to get the chocolate dipped coconut macaroon  it is out of this world!"}
{"text":"This review is for the set-course dinner meals in the back restaurant.

I have enjoyed Enrico's twice. The first was for business in mid-winter 2011. The five-course meal was to die for. They did a perfect job balancing the flavors and keeping serving sizes manageable so you can truly enjoy each dish! For this dinner we rented out the restaurant.

My second trip was in this summer, 2012. Another fantastic five course dinner for a birthday celebration with a large group. We did not have the entire restaurant to ourselves. The set up is one very long table that you share with another party and then one smaller long table you can share as well. This is great if you are social and enjoy chatting with other people enjoying the same food too!

The multiple courses are fabulous and exciting (you don't know what you are getting until it is right in front of you!) Another bonus... they have the ability to adapt to allergies - such as gluten free diets. 

I am just waiting for another opportunity to go. I believe it is around $50 per person, which is great for what you get. BYOB!"}
{"text":"This place just gets better and better each time. New specials and such friendly staff. Definitely one of my favs in Pitt. Every time I visit my daughter this will be a must do lunch for us. Then of course stop by next door for the biscotti to take home back to jersey. See you in the fall."}
{"text":"This looks like an awesome place, with friendly staff and lots of great looking biscottis and other baked goods. 

The only problem?  There's nothing vegan here at all, and that's the premise of my reviews.  It really doesn't deserve a three star review, so if they add a single item that's vegan, I'll gladly adjust the review.

Check out the cafe in back though - that looks awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast in the Strip District!
We loved walking around the Strip District on a recent Saturday morning, and had been encouraged to have breakfast at Enrico's. We were not disappointed. Well ... a *tad* disappointed to find out that the *bread bakery* was out of bread to make French Toast. Nevertheless, we persisted! The biscuits and gravy were luscious and just sinful. We felt vindicated by following them up with green eggs and ham (fried eggs over kale with ham & white beans). Fiber cancels out fat, amiright? ;) The service was fantastic! Super cool to see the wood fired oven. Would def come again over future visits to PGH!"}
{"text":"Today was my second time in the joint.  There was no line in here because it's a Tuesday.  The weekends are ridic so I recommend checking it out mid-week.  I don't even care for biscotti's because they are typically a challenge to eat and there are biscotti's galore in here...  The reason I came in here was because I wanted a sweet treat..,something other than chocolate.  I ordered the raspberry turnover which was pressed flat and not exactly crescent shaped as they typically tend to be.  This thing was delicious!  Dusted crystal sugar on top and flaky the way turnovers tend to be when they are so fresh.  The store is small and has variety of breads, dessert case with scones, brownies, cookies, turnovers, and much more.  The price here is slightly high but still within reason.  My treat was $2.50 and worth every cent!"}
{"text":"Breakfast today at Enrico's Cafe left me unimpressed.  If only the food matched the funky, cozy atmosphere they would have a winner. I ordered the french toast and coffee and the coffee was good.  The french toast...well, let's say it was like no other french toast I have ever had. Two very small thin slices of old bread served with two very limp pieces of bacon does not a $10.00 breakfast make-very over-priced and poor quality. There were no redeeming qualities to that breakfast other than the very pleasant server."}
{"text":"Enrico has been making beautiful old school biscotti for a long time and it shows. They are crumbly as they should be but still good enough to munch on without a coffee in sight.  The macadamia white chocolate is my favorite.  The other baked goods leave a bit to be desired in my opinion.

That said, what you really don't want to miss is the tiny restaurant tucked behind the bakery.

You'll feel like you're in on the best kept secret in the Burgh when you sneak down the narrow sidewalk and step down into the rustic kitchen dining room.  You'll be seated  at one of the few tables lined against a brick wall opposite giant mixers and bakery ovens.  The service is warm, friendly and casual like you're in your auntie's Italian kitchen.

The menu is small but right on target.  The homemade pizzas are deliciously simple and the \"big fat salad\" is more balanced and satisfying than those found at Enrico's upscale counterparts.  

I'm a fan of marble tabletops, smart looking waiters, and trendy tempuras but I'll take a consistently satisfying lunch at Enrico over them almost any day."}
{"text":"......yeea so my biscotti barely made it out the door

one bite and I could. not. stop. then i ate my fiance's biscotti ;)

Also, they make doggie biscotti
and gluten free biscotti
AAdorbsssssss"}
{"text":"Damn this place was good! My wife and I tried 3 different Biscotti each. All were fabulous. What a dangerous place! If I lived near this place, I'd be here at least once a week to stock up. If in Pittsburg, this place is a must .."}
{"text":"Biscottis that won't break your teeth!
Not too sweet, gazillion different flavors, all light and perfect with coffee."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good. I want to go back for more. The rose was also tasty. I got the fig jam pizza and wish that it had maybe not quite as much fig jam, and had a salty meat to go with the sweetness, but it was still good. It just wasn't exactly what I was in the mood for that day. The crust was amazing though.

The cafe is tiny. It will have a wait, but they try to clear things fast and once you order, your food will be made quickly. The staff is super friendly and makes the whole place feel like home. It's a little crowded, but it's not like you're on top of the next table. I'd be willing to try brunch, but it might be hard to not just order pizza every time. 

The actual store is awesome. I love the biscotti. There are so many flavors. The other desserts that I've had were good too, but I mostly focus on the biscotti."}
{"text":"Love Enrico's baked goods, breads and their meals in their little restaurant.

I went to their bread making class with my mom, her friend and my girlfriend and we had a blast. The baker and owner was the one giving the class and he explained to us in minute detail the historical triumphs of bread and how it fits into everything as a cause-and-affect relationship. He was incredibly cheerful and informative.

At 50 dollars a person you get a HUGE breakfast. When I say huge I mean an entire long table full of pastries, cookies, muffins, homemade pastas, bean dishes, homemade sausage, freshly baked bread and many MANY more that I can't even remember. The beginning of the class is stuffing your face and passing the plates around like a big family as you are told about bread.

Making the bread was a lot of fun. The dough was already made and ready to go; all we did was kneed it (he showed us the correct way) and toss it into their awesome wood fired oven. The bread making class isn't at all about the actual making of the bread. It's more about familiarizing yourself with what bread is, learning good techniques and throwing away bad ones and separating the facts and myths of culinary. When you get home you have the knowledge and motivation to then go and make some of your own bread. It was a lot of fun and I would definitely do it again!"}
{"text":"We got some biscotti and brought it around to the cafe for lattes! I was a little unclear on where to go/order/get seating, but thankfully someone approached us and asked what we wanted, so we ordered our coffees and then got a seat. Someone kindly wiped down our table, and I asked our waiter for a water. He came back to tables around us several times....still no coffee or water. Maybe 10 minutes later, he apologized and said our lattes were coming....so I asked for water a second time. When he brought our lattes I asked for water a third time. Still no water. He came back to check on us when my husband was finished with his biscotti and coffee and I was halfway done and my husband reminded him about my water. I finally got my water about 25 minutes in. So that was not really great. 

But besides that, it was tasty, the servers were nice, and the environment is amazing. The exposed brick and lights make for a really nice escape from the busyness of the Strip. Definitely would like to go back and get some food. Hopefully my server will bring my water next time."}
{"text":"Both of my sons were home for thanksgiving and us men decided breakfast at DeLucas on Saturday a good idea. Wrong!  A long line outside convinced us to find an alternative. Across the street Enrico's looked interesting. I didn't know they served breakfast but lunch has always been a treat.  Wow! The breakfast menu was not your usual fare but a eclectic selection items such as Greens, eggs  and ham,  a breakfast salad with an egg on top and a homemade granola.  There were many other items that had a Italian theme.  The Cafe is a small venue between two buildings that is by no means fancy but has a rustic feeling. I only gave the place three stars because service was uneven but very friendly. Also my one son didn't get any bread. They forgot. Also my meal was missing the sprinkling of Parmesan that was to be included."}
{"text":"This place is so small you might miss it walking around the Strip, but the biscotti aroma literally wafts out into the street and pulls you in. I did an immediate about-face after strolling past the door the first time. There are about a jillion varieties of biscotti filling the glass displays and jars all around Enrico's. Hazelnut, chocolate vanilla, orange nutmeg almond, lemon... you name it, they've probably made it. 

The one flavor I REALLY wanted though, was the peanut butter bacon biscotti. Alas... it's a dog biscotti. WOMP WOMP. Why is this deliciousness restricted to canines only!? Make a human version; I'll beg and play dead and shake your hand, whatever it takes!"}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the biscotti (and maybe some of the other pastries). It's awesome. Perfectly crunchy without being hard. Every flavor I've had has been satisfying. The salted caramel chocolate is my favorite, but the white chocolate covered chocolate is my persons favorite due to being subtly sweet and highly addictive. They also sell pastries that are very good. I have never been here for brunch, but I do recommend this place if you're in the mood for something sweet. The little bags of biscotti are also really nice for gift baskets and/or for presents for guests."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the margherita pizza and the big fat salad as a side. 

The service is excellent and if you're lucky enough to actually meet Enrico, try to. He's friendly, on top of things and great with kids. He even went and got our little man a chocolate cookie from his bakery. 

The bakery itself is awesome. Cookies, pies, cakes, bread, biscottis and more. We got a strawberry two layer cake to share and it was a hit."}
{"text":"I had absolutely no idea what to expect from Enrico when it came to brunch.  I cannot count the number of times that the wife and I have walked past the Enrico side path and mentioned to each other that we should give it a try...  we'll, we finally did.

Overall, the staff was very welcoming when we arrived.  We were quickly seated and our drinks were brought out in no time.  While we loved the small, cozy and unique space, I didn't love that fact that my coffee mug was both broken (chipped on the rim and cracked down the side) and soiled (lip stick on the rim).  I asked for another mug and one was quickly brought out nonetheless.

When it came to the food, I ordered the breakfast strata per the waitress's suggestion and the wife ordered the breakfast risotto.  At this point I had low expectations (actually no expectations...  I had no idea what would come out), so I was pleasantly surprised when my dish was quite good.  Awesome combination of good  soft bread w/ crusty edges and a smooth center coupled with syrup (thankfully that was included, otherwise the dish would of been lacking).  While I was pleased with my meal, my wife's risotto overall was pretty bland (it needed a heap of salt and pepper to make it attractive to eat).

While we love Enrico's biscotti, I'd have to think again if we'd revisit the cafe.  We left feeling satisfied with what we had eaten, but definitely in no way impressed."}
{"text":"Great texture.   Significantly overpriced for being essentially shortbread cookies.  Very subtle flavors.  Really didn't even taste any licorice."}
{"text":"I took the bread baking class and it was informative and very detailed regarding things like the technique for rolling out the bread. The antithesis of this would be the people working in the bakery. Fillings and flavorings in items are sometimes almost nonexistent, especially in things that you can't see like croissants and ravioli. Some of the cookies crumble in your hand before you can even get them to your mouth. While the bread is usually pretty consistent, the bakery items(?), not so much. My wife loves the biscotti but I personally have a hard time telling the difference between one and another as regards to flavor, unless it is chocolate, and then all the chocolates pretty much taste the same. They are dry and crumbly and a completely different texture than almost all other types. If you haven't had them before, don't buy a dozen at first, just go with a few to see if it is what you want."}
{"text":"The biscottis are amazing! My friend and I stopped here both days of our 2-day trip to Pittsburgh and got some to take home with us too!"}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS HIDDEN LITTLE GEM!!!

My 2nd time in Pittsburgh, 1st visit to the strip district. Was shopping/exploring with my bf & his parents when we got hungryyyy! We first looked at the historic diners (& walked right past the massive lines). I'm so glad- we glanced over & saw this little doorway tucked back off the street. I've lived in Italy for a year, I was immediately intrigued & excited.

Enrico's did not dissappoint. We were greeted by the cheerful staff, seated quickly- the place was bustling, full of chatting/eating patrons & smelled ahhhh-mazing. We were quickly greeted by our waitress, drinks served just as quickly & our food arrived promptly after we ordered. I had the smoked salmon plate,  my bf had the white truffle mushroom scramble, his father had the sausage stata, his mum had the featured sausage & apple hash--all of it...Y.U.M.
We didn't converse much-- we were too busy sharing & enjoying eachother's dishes. Our server was efficient, attentive, cheerful (our drinks were never empty). The entire staff was enthusiastic & genuinely happy to see us. 

Clearly this is a restaurant full of an entire staff who love their jobs & genuinely enjoy providing this amazing food to their guests- we are absolutely coming back next visit."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch.  It is a small interesting place.  Seating is limited and the food selection as well.  However the quality of the food seems to be good with good quality ingredients.  Me and my company where all satisfied with the food we got.  The service was though very slow and for sure not competent :) However in general I think I would try the place again."}
{"text":"Split a pizza. It came out quick and was really good. Not many tables but we were there for lunch on a weekday. I can't wait to go back. The only reason for 4 and not 5 is the place was a little dirty but that's what you get sometimes in the Strip. The food was worth it though."}
{"text":"My review is based on the bakery portion only.   The bakery area is relatively small and it can get crowded, but the goodies there are fantastic.  They offer numerous varieties of double baked biscotti, all of which are fantastic.  I have my favorites, mostly all are Anise based, but the varieties are so vast.  Peanut butter chocolate, black pepper walnut, pistachio, almond, cranberry...you name it, they have it.  They also offer some other baked goods and bread.   

Super friendly staff that is always willing to assist you.   This is a place I always stop at when in the strip.   It is a great place if you are in the mood for some italian biscotti."}
{"text":"The biscotti is as amazing as ever.

In my countless visits here, I just realized that there is a connecting cafe that serves up Italian fare. We were a tad too early for lunch so I'll definitely give it a go around the next time around. 

Another cool thing is that the biscotti can now be purchased prepackaged by flavor and Larry assured me that they ship the goods!"}
{"text":"The Enrico Biscotti Company's cafe is by far my favorite place for weekend lunch in Pittsburgh. It's not open in the evenings, otherwise it would be my favorite dinner place too! I've come here with friends and a bottle of wine for a long, relaxing lunch and with my mother for a takeout lunch before running errands. Whatever the situation, this lovely establishment never disappoints. The people who work here are friendly, and the space is small but not cramped. They have the sweetest little patio for the warmer months too. 

Enrico's keeps their menu pared down, and that's a huge part of their success. Having traveled in Italy, I often crave the delicious simplicity of Italian cuisine. The food at Enrico's always satisfies me in this regard. They offer a few small pizzas, some sandwiches, a salad, and beans and greens. The latter two dishes can be ordered topped with roast chicken or a fried egg. Everything is absolutely wonderful. The salad (with chicken) would have to be my favorite however. As my friends would tell you, I'm never the first one at the table to order a salad...I prefer heartier foods as a general rule. Enrico's salad is too delicious and filling to pass up though, so I keep coming back for it. It's got a good mix of dark leafy greens (no iceberg in sight!) and the chicken compliments it so well. I order mine sans cheese, but it typically comes topped with that also. Whatever you order has a piece of Enrico's heavenly bread on the side...they even teach classes so you can replicate the deliciousness and take fresh bread home with you. Sign me up!"}
{"text":"The cafe is really cute.  The pizza was no good though.  The crust was undercooked and the sauce and cheese were both really bland.  They did give us good bread w/ olive oil before hand though.  That was better than the pizza."}
{"text":"So many biscottis! Almond, almond anise, apricot, apricot hazelnut, banana walnut, black forest, black pepper walnut, cherry, chocolate, chocolate orange almond, chocolate vanilla swirl, cinnamon, coconut chocolate chip, cornmeal, cranberry pistachio, fig pecan, ginger, hazelnut, lemon, macadamia nut, orange almond nutmeg... SO many biscottis.

The best way to sample them is to get yourself an Assorted Bag of mini biscottis, which will set you back about $6-- not bad considering the wealth of flavors that are packed in there.

On another note, we also picked up a Coconut Macaroon ($1.50), which was not as good as the Yelp & foursquare tips would lead you to believe."}
{"text":"I really had high hopes for the biscotti here. The store front is so inviting, hip, nice selection of pastries but obviously biscotti is their specialty so that is what my husband and I bought. We should have just picked up a few to try our mistake was buying a dozen.

I asked what their best sellers were and all the best sellers are dipped in chocolate. I really wanted to taste their twice baked biscuits flavor profiles without the chocolate distraction so we bought an assortment of different flavors. After my first bite..... I knew why their best sellers are dipped in chocolate. 

The biscotti are visually beautiful, texturally they are traditionally hard and toothsome (definitely need to dip these cookies in liquid) they are traditional even in their sugar/flour ratio but that doesn't mean they should be flavorless?? You could not pick out the almond, anise or orange flavors they were suppose to contain. In all honesty these were the most bland flavorless biscotti I have ever tried. My husband also thought they were equally as boring and the dozen biscotti were unfortunately thrown in the bin. I really wanted to like this place too. Maybe their other confections are more flavorful but I would not recommend the biscotti."}
{"text":"I came here with my family after my college graduation. Larry was amazing... We all just loved him, he was hilarious. He even brought me over some free cookies from the other side of the restaurant, where the bakery is. We had a large group, but they accommodated our needs. It was really busy on a Saturday. They don't usually take reservations, but they hooked us up when I called earlier that morning. Food was very authentic Italian (I've been to Italy twice). There were a few errors with our food, but they corrected it right away and gave us a free pizza for being so patient"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for sandwiches, soups or salad. The beans and greens are amazing, as are the salads and breads.

The ambiance is relaxed and casual, and the food is always excellent. Enrico's is great for conversation or for resting your feet while shopping at the Strip.

They have a First Friday Dinner which is BYOB with no corkage fee. 

On Saturday's you can buy a bottle of Carlo's Garage Winery, they make the wine downstairs."}
{"text":"I love Enrico's, been coming here for years. Awesome baked goods, cafe, service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I really REALLY R*E*A*L*L*Y want to like this place.  Truly I do.  But the staff/ownership just keep throwing roadblocks in the way.  The biscotti is pretty damn good, but the staff seem to be TRAINED to act annoyed, uninterested, arrogant and condescending.  

We go to the Strip twice a month.  Love shopping down there.  A visit to EB three weeks ago was our last one.    My wife inquired about the price of an almond specialty that has varied in price over the last few months.  The clerk -- a middle-aged guy -- made an audible sigh and rolled his eyes before answering.  That, to me, was a pretty clear \"f--- you\" from the staff.  IF the price had been posted, I MIGHT understand the reaction...  And that's only one of what's been a regular series of events with EB.   And for us, it's been the last.  I'll buy biscotti from the vendors in front of Penn Mac.   At least they act as if they care about their patrons.  

I wish 'em luck.  I really do."}
{"text":"Um, delicious. I don't think I ever knew I liked biscotti, until Enrico's. During my first excursion to The Strip, I walked by a few times before I realized where the mouthwatering baked-good smell was coming from. 

When I walked inside I was surrounded - literally - by biscotti. There were jars and jars & trays and trays of them, at first I didn't even notice the person hidden behind them willing & waiting to help me. 

I got a hodge-podge of flavors. Pistachio-Cranberry, Chocolate-Almond, Peanut-Butter-Chocolate-Chip, & others I can't even remember (1.50ea). There are some fancy-shmancy ones that are drizzled in white or milk chocolate (1.75). 

Proceeded to scoff approximately 4 of them in 2 days, then return to bring some back to my office as a treat. 

They didn't make it in quite the condition I got them in, as I was forced to plane-side check my bag, thanks for that US Airways & jacka**es who put their coats in overhead bins leaving no room for other people's precious biscotti. HOWEVER, despite the less than perfect appearance, my co-workers loved them. 

4.5 stars if I could! Will try the cafe next time I'm there!"}
{"text":"EB is the place to go to escape the hustle that is the strip district on a Saturday afternoon. While waiting in what seemed like a never ending line for Deluca's, I noticed a small sign across the street that said breakfast and lunch served here. I hurried across the street to check it out while the ladies continued to wait in line. I first entered the bakery and was engulfed by the sight and aroma of fresh baked treats. Before I realized it, I was part of a line to order. Oh what the heck. Might as well get a few biscotti while I'm here. So many flavors to choose from! I was also enticed by the croissants but decided to hold out seeing I had yet to eat lunch. After ordering my biscotti, I asked about lunch service and was directed to go around the side of the building and to the back. As I walked to the back, I was transported to a small cafe in Italy complete with an open kitchen and small tables outside the restaurant. The decor drew me in, I didn't even need to see the menu. I quickly ran to the street and waved the ladies over. We were immediately seated and given the lunch menu (11:45). Oh, no breakfast options? Oh well, lunch looked amazing. I ordered the original sangweech with italian meats, mozzarella, sauce and field greens. The ladies decided to both get the margherita pizza. Our lunches arrived quickly and I eagerly dug in. The bread used for the sangweech was pizza dough. So, imagine a pizza with italian meats, cheese, topped with field greens folded in half. That's a sangweech. A near perfect sandwhich. My only criticism is that there seemed to be a lot of field greens and not much sauce. If the field greens were dressed with an italian dressing, this sangweech would be a home run. After eating half, I decided to pack up the other half and take it home so that I had room for dessert. Our server chatted off the list of bakery items available. I chose the chocolate croissant. Kudos to me on an incredible choice. Light, flaky, smooth chocolate. This could have easily been something I had purchased from a french bakery on my recent trip to Paris. I was hooked. If you're in the strip and what a different experience from the loud and over crowded shops, sneak back to EB. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've purchased biscotti here for years, but never stoped for breakfast until yesterday. Oh what I've been missing! The interior is so cute and you are basically in the kitchen. The taste of the coffee is always a giveaway as to the quality of the food and the cappuccino was perfection! The breakfast menu is not a light menu so go hungry! My friend had the carbonara (yes! Pasta for breakfast) and I had the torta rustics (quiche). The textures were so interesting.  Creamy eggs, Italian meats, ricotta cheese and I even think hard boiled eggs.  The portion was huge, but before I knew it, I had eaten the entire piece.  Awesome place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Owner always greets with warm welcome. Outstanding service. Delicious food. Fantastic servers. My favorite Pittsburgh restaurant and experience in the Strip District."}
{"text":"This is a must for biscotti fans! They probably have about 20-30 flavors of biscotti to choose from and they are gigantic! I have tried the lemon, pineapple and almond.. I wish they can put more pineapple chunks and maybe make it more lemony? The almond one was crunchy and I think I like it the best. I realized the textures of the 3 are slightly different, I personally prefer the crunchy type :) 

This place is pretty hidden, look up for the store sign.. A must go if you are in Pittsburgh downtown! You will know when you're in the right place as you can smell the fresh baked goods once stepping in.."}
{"text":"Pizza is 4 star.smoky.hearty toppings but disappointed with the rest-lasagna was below average.
Brought the table next to ours breadsticks but not to us???not sure why.it was not on the menu so it was definitely not ordered.
Drop by for a pizza if u like but otherwise nothing special.honestly there are much better options downtown which is 5 mins drive from here."}
{"text":"I'm severely allergic to baked goods... My ass has this horrible reaction where it swells up and my pants don't fit...;(

It's a hard crunchy sweet slice of biscuit-like thing you dip in coffee... They usually have 'em at bakery or coffee shops...

They keep at least a week at room temperature if well wrapped up... and they freeze beautifully for at least a couple of months...Mmm...i'm not a big fan of biscotti..but these tends to A OK...compared to the store brought ones i usually get... theirs over thirty flavors when it comes to biscotti...pretty impressive for a small mom and pop shop..."}
{"text":"$3.50 for 2 simple almond biscotti!!! Crazy. They were not even that good. My companion threw his away after one bite! No flavor."}
{"text":"I do not understand all the high ratings. I am a biscotti lover and even bake them myself. These were not good at all. After two bites I tossed them into the trash."}
{"text":"The bakery is probably as close to what Heaven smells like as you can get.  I've never eaten at the restaurant and as such this review is exclusively in regard to the bakery.  I'm actually not sure why you would eat at the restaurant since you could easily just go into the bakery and ruin your dinner with the biscotti, macaroons, and cookies.  

They have about 20 different styles of biscotti and I've never been disappointed with any of them.  They are not as hard as the biscotti I've had at other bakeries but they are way better than any biscotti I've ever had. 

While I'm not a huge macaroon fan (not big on coconut) their macaroons are the best looking macaroons I've ever seen and according to everyone I've ever been with that has had them, they are delicious and they usually claim they are the best they've ever had. 

Overall its an awesome place.  You can't get everything you would at a standard bakery but the items that they have are so good and he smell is so intoxicating that you can't help but fall in love with this place."}
{"text":"Not gona lie.  We wanted to have breakfast at DeLucas in the strip.   But the line was ridicules.

I have loved Enrico's biscotti and pastries for a few years now.   But we never ventured past the iron gates to try the restaurant.   

Today we did.   Feeling very thankful that we did.   We just made it for the breakfast menu.  What I adored was that as we browsed the menu, Enrico himself sat at the entrance working/relaxing.  He encouraged us to just go in, sit down, they will make you whatever you want. 

We chose to sit in the alley area.   It was a bit chilly, but so worth the ambiance.   I ordered the sausage risotto served with a sunny side up egg on top. My husband had the biscuits and sausage gravy.   

Both were incredible.   Portion was great.   Slightly pricey, but truly worth every penny!!!"}
{"text":"I have dined at Enrico's a few times and order the Margherita pizza each time I go! The place itself is really adorable. It's like something you would see in Europe; it's pretty tiny inside. I really love the outdoor seating area! The pizza is wood fired and I'm a girl who loves the wood fired pizza life! They are not stingy on the basil or mozzarella, overall it tastes delish :)

Now onto the dessert. I have tried their macaroons and biscotti. The macaroons are pretty good and big in size. There are three different ones, almond, coconut and chocolate dipped coconut. I would have to say the coconut one is my favorite! The biscotti on the other hand fell short for me. I know some biscotti can be pretty solid and others are easier to bite into. These ones are pretty solid, and for me personally I can't get onboard with chipping a tooth. I have had biscotti from other places that I would definitely choose over Enrico's."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas. One cheese and one was their special. The crust was wonderful. Soft and chewy. The owner was very friendly, gave my kids a cookie and was awesome. Staff was friendly and the decor was great. 

My lower review is mostly due to the marinara sauce. It tasted like a can of stewed tomatoes were opened and lightly chopped and thrown on a pizza. A little salt and spice would go a very long way. 
The white pizza we shared was really nice, and I loved that they use real olive. 
The marinara and the price however prompt me to give them a 3 over a four. But check it out and try something other than a marinara pizza and it might be worth it."}
{"text":"Soooo I have a biscotti addiction. It all started with the red velvet biscotti from Crazy Mocha. Ever since I had one of those and dunked it in my coffee, I was on a mental quest to find them. On a morning stroll in the strip I came across Enrico and was extremely excited. They don't have red velvet but I love the chocolate chip and coconut.  They have other Italian desserts, I love the coconut macaroon which is the size of my fist and dipped in chocolate. Its like a baseball sized mounds candy bar."}
{"text":"The Enrico Biscotti Co is a small Italian restaurant and bakery, run by a friendly group of people.  My friends and I stopped in on our lunch break, and we really enjoyed our meal.  It was about $13 including tax and tip for a lunch portion of pasta.

Our server was very friendly, and he immediately brought out a DELICIOUS loaf of bread and oil.  I could have made a meal of the bread alone.  I ended up ordering a pasta dish (name is lost) with red peppers, basil, and plenty of cheese!  It was a great portion for lunch; I was pleasantly stuffed at the end of the meal.  

When our server brought our bill, we each got a cute mini biscotti.  With Biscotti in the restaurant name, you expect the biscotti to be some of the best.  This biscotti was definitely great.  The flavor was delicious, and it was fresh.  Who wants to break a tooth on biscotti?  Not me.

Our server was really friendly, and authentically Italian in his flirtatious nature.  It's not \"fast\" service, but it was good service.

We tried to order cannolis from the bakery twice, but both days we went, they were completely out by lunch time on a week day.  Bummer!  I'd still love to try one, but I probably will only try once more to get one.  It seems like lunch time is awfully early to be out of such a common Italian dessert.

I will definitely make a return to Enrico's!"}
{"text":"Holy amazing cookies!  I was very happy that I went on a Thursday morning when it was raining.  I got the place to myself.  The smell in this place is unbelievable.  There are so many kinds of biscotti to try.  I got a box and filled it with 8 different kinds.  The best ones were the while chocolate macadamia and expresso, chocolate, date almond.  Oh yeah!  I also tried a chocolate covered macaroon at the suggestion of the employee there. I wish I ordered a box of them.  (But my waistline is glad I didnt) The employee was super friendly and the biscotti are really reasonably priced.  Apparently they will ship biscotti anywhere.  Good to know."}
{"text":"This is a review for the awesome little restaurant tucked away along side of the bakery and behind it.  How did I not know that this was here for so long???

On a whim, we were hungry and decided to grab a bite as we were meandering around the Strip.  We landed here.  It looked cute, like an old little cafe that you would find in Italy.  We got the Pizza Bianco and Margherita.  They reminded us of the pizza we had had at Pi Coal Fired (which we loved).  Mine was a little excessively garlic laden, but still good.  My husband seemed to like his a lot as well.  The basil was so fresh and yummy too.  Lately I have been a sucker for good fresh basil.

We will definitely be back to try more items... who knows, another good experience or two and I may have to update my review to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Biscotti and more biscotti.   What else could you ask for from a place that calls itself the Biscotti Company?   There are so many flavors available.   You can order them by the piece from the dessert cases in front, or buy the pre-packaged bags from the back for quicker service."}
{"text":"One of the top ten bakeries in the country and a whole lotta unique extras to go with the baked goods! Enrico's brings the best of the old to the new. Everything they make is baked fresh on the day on premise. Their breads, croissants, and cakes are just off the charts and not comparable to anywhere else because most of the recipes go back generations. The almond cake is ridiculous. The buckeyes are addictive. And the dog loves the dog biscotti.

The big surprise is the lunch they provide in the back. By the time breakfast is over, the kitchen in the back is transformed to a lunch spot with a simple but phenomenal menu of Italian classics. My favorite? The spaghetti carbonara as prepared by Larry himself. Nothing like it.

Give Larry a big hug from his buddy in Vegas when you go see him. Enrico's is a true classic."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! Tucked into a narrow alley way on Liberty Ave in the Strip you will find Enrico Biscotti. With all its charm and delicious food, I'd say it's a must-stop place for visitors and Pittsburgh-ers alike!

My husband and I took some relatives here on a Saturday AM around 1045. The place it's self is small, kind of cramped actually, but is so darn cute! If it were only the 2 of us, I'd consider giving it 5 stars, but when you're that cramped, it makes things a little hard to work with.

The food though! 5 stars! I ordered the breakfast pasta carbonara and my husband ordered the biscuits and sausage gravy. My pasta cooked well, the sauce was creamy and rich, and the bacon was thick enough to know it was there but cooked well. The biscuits and gravy are the best I've ever tried. Now, let's not all go crazy about the biscuits and gravy from the south, or your grandmothers or whoever, I'm fairly new to the biscuit/gravy game. The biscuit was fluffy and buttery and the gravy definitely hit you with sausage up front but creamy on the back. When you add the two over easy eggs on top.. voila! Delicious.

I'll definitely be going back because I want to try their pizza. It's on my list."}
{"text":"This place is one of those hidden gems. It's off the beaten path and through an alley. The only thing you see is a sign for brick oven pizza. You get greeted immediately. We arrived at 2pm on a Saturday and the place was packed!

Luckily we got a table. The brought out our drinks and then went over the specials. They had eggplant which immediately won me over. The gf ordered the white pizza. Both came out very quickly.

Mine was cooked over some home made pasta and ripe Italian plum tomatoes. The eggplant was crunchy and delicious. 

They staff also brought out some free wine tastings and some free bread and olive oil and Parmesan cheese.

Would highly recommend. Great place to grab a quick bite while you walk around and enjoy the ambiance."}
{"text":"maybe the biscotti is great, but i had the worst chocolate chip brick of a cookie ever in my life here."}
{"text":"This place is hidden and you have to walk through this beautiful ally

food is great and the restaurant is beautiful"}
{"text":"Great place. Stopped in for an espresso and biscotti but stayed for breakfast. Would I like some carbonara for breakfast? Yeah, everyday!! The service was great and everyone seemed to really care about what they were doing."}
{"text":"This place is just \"OK\" but nothing special. The flatbread pizzas are good for lunch. The pasta dishes are nothing special at all."}
{"text":"We were checking out the stip for the first time and quite hungry so we stopped here. The place is on small the small side, very cute and cozy. We were seated right away. I chose the scrambled eggs with truffles, my partner chose the strata, we both ordered coffee and of course we had to order one of the thirty something biscottis they offer; we went with the chocolate almond drizzled with white chocolate. I asked for cream for my coffee, but they didn't have any, nor did they have soy or non-fat so they brought whole milk. 

Our biscotti was delicious, my eggs were so-so; the truffles were great, but I really like hot sauce on my eggs and they didn't have any, this shocked me. The server offered to bring me a side of red pepper flakes and that improved the eggs, but it's not the same. How can you serve eggs and not have hot sauce somewhere? On a positive note: The bread served with my eggs was very good. My partner hated her strata and said she couldn't taste the bacon inside of it so rather than being savory and sweet it was just too sweet. 

Overall I enjoyed this place because the servers were nice and the atmosphere was pleasant. However, we probably wouldn't eat another meal here since we didn't love the food, but we would stop in for a biscotti and coffee."}
{"text":"Delicious Biscotti with many different flavors. Always come here to get some biscotti as a present for my parents. The biscotti also lasts a long time. I think they said months if put in an air-tight container.

My favorite is their Cranberry-Pistachio but also like their chocolate hazelnut one."}
{"text":"Went for a lovely lunch with my lovely partner.

A nice reprieve from typical Strip fare!  The lunch menu included 2-3 salads, 3 soups, 5-6 pizzas and 5-6 sangweeches (sandwiches).  Everything ranges from about $6-10.  Both my partner and I got the 1/2 sandwich special, her opting for the pumpkin soup abreast her roasted red pepper artichoke sandwich.  I went for the beans & greens next to my \"original\" sandwich that included salami and two other types of sausage with some good provolone and greens.  The flat bread used for the sandwiches (which I assume they also use for pizza) was fabulous and easily the highlight of my meal.

I really liked the atmosphere, they cram about 6-7 4-person tables and as many 2-person tables into half of their kitchen where they're making biscotti as well as your lunch!  Service was very likeable.

Overall I had a fantastic time.  Maybe a bit on the pricey side for lunch, while not out of line, I would rather pay $8 or 9 for a soup and sandiwch as opposed to $10.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This hidden cafe is something not to be missed. I first discovered it a few years ago on a recommendation by a friend, \"Go down that little alley\" she said.  The cafe's atmosphere drew me in, with the exposed brick and various baking pans and large whisks hung off the scaffolding.  Now, after years of visits, Enrico's feels like home. 

I was first impressed with the brick oven pizza.  Thin, baked to perfection, with a delicious crust.  Another friend who'd spent a month traveling in Italy look for the perfect slice said that Enrico's pizza rivaled everything he'd tried that summer.  My favorite pizza is the white pizza with gorgonzola and dried cranberries.  They're always happy to make it for me, even when it's not listed on that day's menu.

On the menu, I saw the listings for the First Friday dinners and the bread class.  They only serve dinner during these special dinner nights (Now including the Big Italian Throwdown at the last Friday of every month.) And, wow, what a dinner and a deal. The best time to go is in the summer and early fall when all the veggies are fresh and local. You pay $50 (BYO) for a 4 or 5 course dinner that is incomparable. (Highlights: a peach and tomato salad with basil and balsamic, and the short ribs)

The bread class:  $50 for a Sunday afternoon at Enrico's.  It seems expensive but it was worth it.  You're served brunch in addition to learning how to bake the bread.  We left with enough leftovers that it made the price worth it.  My husband has been baking bread in this style ever since.  

If you haven't been here, you should stop by and try it.  Bring some wine to share. They're open for lunch every day of the week."}
{"text":"Holy cannoli! 

Was on the way to gauchos for lunch and my friend insisted we had to get a cannoli before they sold out.  Not harboring much of a sweet tooth and the the thought of having dessert before lunch was soooooo unorthodox but soooooo glad we did because we snagged the last 3! 

It was only 1pm on a Tuesday and they were out and I totally get why...so divine they blew my mind. 

It was the perfect size and texture. The shell was just hard to bite into but soft enough the ricotta filled goodness didn't seep out everywhere.  I really liked how it wasn't overstuffed but not understuffed- it was literally the perfect trifecta of filling, sweetness, and crust- the holy cannoli. 

Got to try the biscotti next time but until then, will plan another trip to the strip to satisfy my once dormant sweet tooth!

p.s. Will also have to try to make it to the bakers class one day early morning!"}
{"text":"This is going to sound strange but I don't go to Enrico's Biscotti for the biscotti. I usually go there Saturdays for brunch and so far I've been happy: the menu is well balanced, the pizza and bread are fresh and the coffee is a-ok!

The ambiance in the cafe is very very nice. You walk a tiny alley, sneak through a door and enter a fairly narrow room with an open kitchen. The best thing is that this is one of the few places where the kitchen is larger than the seating areas. You will get your hot beverages in mismatched cups which adds to the charm and often enough you'll talk to people that are nice to talk to. Last time we were there we got strong recommendations for the lunch goulash and after being prompted to try it with compliments from the chef I have to say that I need to go back. 

I did try their biscotti plenty of times and I must say I'm not impressed but then again I'm not a connoisseur."}
{"text":"They advertise as a biscotti bakery (and those are good to be sure), but I love them for their oven fresh butter croissant. They're huge and flakey. If you get in there around 8 they're still warm and a little crunchy. They have lots of other pastry as well. Give 'me a shot if your in the Strip."}
{"text":"*I have died and gone to heaven.\"  Mark my grave with biscotti from Enrico's. 

My review is based on a whirlwind less than 48 hour trip to the 'Burgh that had me eating whenever and where ever something looked tasty.  I made a purchase here for dessert to take back for that night and biscotti for the plane ride the next day.  And a little nibble in the car on the way home (geez, so I suck a tiny bite... w/e!)

I got a total of 2 biscotti and 2 chocolate oblivion minis (3 bite sizes of flourless chocolate cake).

+ 1 Star - Variety.  I mean, who knew that there were over 20 types o biscotti made here - and most are available every day.  Variety is the spice of bakery life.
+ 1 Star - Staff.  How pleasant and funny and knowledgeable.  Every one of them (I chatted with 3) has not just the ingredients committed to memory, but little tales to tell about this flavor and that. Lovely and engaged bakers make for fat, happy eaters o biscotti.
+ 1 Star.  Quality.  I was a little wary that the biscotti would be like shingles, as that is what biscotti always taste like.  Not here, my friend. Here they are as the bakery gods intend biscotti to be - edible with coffee or other dunkables, but also sheer delight on their own.  And that is 90% to do with the excellent ingredients.
+1 Star - The other stuff.  Like I said, I bought two small flourless cake-lettes.  OMG and I never eat desserts.  Thank heavens I don't live in the 'Burgh or I would be here at least weekly.  Or more, as they are across from the yoga studio I like (Bikram!).
+ 1 Star - Price.  Did I mention I bought 2 biscotti and 2 mini-cakes for $5!!!! WTF???!! Amazingly cheap.  I really should have bought more.
- 1 Star - Regret.  That I didn't buy more to take back home with me.  I am still weeping over that.  Yes, I can order online, but it's not... the... same....

I never have a need to go back to Pittsburgh, but I may have to concoct one to go here.  This was my dream-come-true bakery.  Sigh."}
{"text":"If you like Biscotti, you need to try Enrico's. The have a broad assortment of flavors from which to choose, and the shop smells amazing while you contemplate your selection. You can't go wrong, so save yourself some cash and buy the bag of ends for $6. It's the best deal in the shop And guarantees you a variety."}
{"text":"I ate here this past weekend for lunch with my girlfriend.  My friends wife had recommended it to us, otherwise I do not know that we would have noticed it as I have walked by many times without noticing it.

The entrance to it is cute and invokes a little side street bistro in Europe complete with string lights.  We decided to start off our meal with some coffees.  It was easy to tell it wasn't mass produced, had a great taste and was strong too.  For our entrees I decided upon the pollo sanwheech while my girlfriend had the pesto.  My sanwheech consisted of cooked pizza dough flipped over to make a sandwich with field greens, chicken, mushrooms and a piece of pepperoni a side.  It was interesting with the pizza dough as bread and I enjoyed it.  My girlfriends pesto was also one of the better tasting that I had tried recently.  The good food is only half the reason to go as the atmosphere is cool as well.

The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here in the future.  The food was good and the ambience even better."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and haven't had a really bad experience. Yesterday my friend found a piece of chewed gum inside her napkin.
My silverware was wet as the servers hands were wet.
Later I saw our server carrying dirty glasses (4) with his fingers inside the glasses.
Surely he should have used a tray to carry dirty glasses.
I was very put off and probably won't go back. Nothing worse than a dirty restaurant and unkept servers."}
{"text":"How long has the cute little café in the back been here? I noticed a sign with an arrow that read \"hey, look over there\" or something along those lines, simple, caught my eye and attention so my friend and I strolled back to check it out. We had already eaten but decided to stay for a cup of coffee and cheesecake, which was delicious. It was also packed so we sat outside to enjoy the nice weather. Busy as it was, the one lady who was working was so friendly and very efficient. I cant wait to go back and eat there."}
{"text":"How can the biscotti store have incredibly wonderful friendly employees and their cafe be the complete opposite. Stood in the entrance for 5minutes while the employees just looked at us. Upon asking for a table for three they all shrugged and walked away. Finally someone cleared a table and we just helped ourselves. If there was a towel handily I would have wiped the table off. The service was so horrible I can't find the words. The food was ok but we will not be going back. Ever."}

A couple years ago, I was hosting a baby shower at my house and asked the husband what his wife's favorite foods were. He mentioned scones and biscotti, so I had the idea to place a to go order with Enrico for the items. My husband picked it up, and the baked goods simply blew my mind.

Since then, I've tried to come to the shop multiple times on my own, but it has been closed. Finally, this past Sunday, I was able to get in! The bakery's storefront is filled to the brim with pre-made bags of biscotti, dozens of flavors of biscotti sitting in glass jars throughout the shop, and a case filled with scones and other baked treats. We selected one flavor of biscotti (Coconut Chocolate) and three flavors of scones. Though none of the flavors were life-changing like they were with my first order a couple years ago, everything was delicious and perfectly made. Next time, I really need to try some of their other baked goods. The sample of peanut butter cookie sitting on the counter was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Peanut butter biscotti was good. Need a drink because it is a dry cookie. I would go back, but only if the person I was with wanted to go."}
{"text":"After an exhausting rowing practice, I invited a friend to join me for lunch at the cafe at The Enrico Biscotti Company in Pittsburgh's Strip District. I should note that I've have been here a handful of times, always enjoying each each experience.

I consider myself adventurous when it comes to trying different things, but similar to when I dine at Olive or Twist, I always order the same thing when at Enricos - the beans and greens. I love this dish, especially since I make it at home and I enjoy their variation (made with kale) just as much as I enjoy my own  (generally with escarole). Priced at $9, you receive a healthy portion of greens and beans in a delicious broth. As an accompaniment, they serve a small portion of bread to sop up all the broth as you make your way through the meal. For an additional $1, you can order a fried egg to be placed on top. For $2, they'll serve a moderately sized piece of chicken breast. I ordered both!

Not served with, but something you can ask for are red pepper flakes to top the dish. On this particular occasion, I did ask for them, but unfortunately the waitress never returned. I was too hungry to wait and had to get to a hair appointment, so I chowed down. After realizing that she forgot to bring the flakes over to the table, the waitress apologized and noted that she'd take the meal off the menu. I really didn't think that was necessary, but it was a really kind offer and I didn't refuse her gesture.

If you haven't been here, keep in mind that there are only 2 and 4 top tables. The location is tiny and I do not recommend dining here with groups larger than 4."}
{"text":"Get a macaroon for enjoying immediately and a biscotti for the next day's morning coffee.

Should be a no-brainer stop while shopping on the strip."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd of three sweet stops of my Foodie tour of the Strip District in Pittsburgh. I think I was a bit overwhelmed by all the choices and also because we didn't have enough time in the shop I randomly chose a Walnut Biscotti which was really dry and just not too my taste palate. 

I did like that they sold a decent size brown bag of broken biscotti for $7 and that way you could try a whole bunch and find a flavor combo that works for you, so I reckon that's what I will do at my next visit. Unfortunately this visit, the biscotti just didn't do it for me!

Yelp Review 67/ 2017"}
{"text":"It's worth getting a scone or biscotti from Enrico's if just to walk into the bakery and take a good smell. It smells heavenly - how you wish Grandma's kitchen smelled. 

Nice selection of scones and biscotti to tide you over while you walk the Strip doing the rest of your shopping."}
{"text":"I reviewed Enrico 2 years ago and wish there were more stars to give it.  Back then I was still hooked on the Macaroons (which I still love) but now I have unfortunately gotten hooked on so much more.  Their Ricotta Pie is like no other.  For breakfast, for dessert, whatever the occasion, it fits! 
Torte Rusitco- the Italian Quiche- the first time I had this I came back to Chicago searching and searching for one like it and a year and a half later I am still searching.  Thankfully I will be back in Pittsburgh next week so this will definitely be my carry on for the flight home! 

Lemon Tarte- I love lemon and this one is a great classic with the perfect amount of tartness and a flaky crust.  

I cant wait to see what I find in the pastry case on my next trip...maybe something with Chocolate!"}
{"text":"Was so, so let down by my most recent visit.

I remember coming here when I was younger and always getting a free cookie, and being blown away by all the other offerings. I went back for the first time in years this week and was sufficiently underwhelmed. The biscotti that I loved for all my childhood was bland, dry, and stale, while the brownie was hard, dry, and lacking any flavor. 

I really hope I just got there at a bad time because it would be a shame if what I had is representative of their best product. Willing to give it another try but thoroughly disappointed"}
{"text":"One of the many things I love about Pittsburgh is this cafe. When the suburbs get me down and I need to remind myself I can escape, I head here. The food is traditional and fresh. The wine is just wonderful and the staff is helpful in all aspects.  

Looking forward to my next visit already."}
{"text":"Great little place that I stumbled into on Tuesday morning while checking out what Penn Ave had to offer. Grabbed a few different treats and regrettably had to not pick up some of the fresh pepperoni rolls that were sitting out. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Just the smell of fresh bread alone when we walked in made me fall in love with the place. I had one of the calzones and it was very good. We also had a bread basket with olive oil, which was great. The service is super friendly and I love the style of the restaurant, especially how you can see the kitchen. If I had more time in town, I would definitely be going back very often."}
{"text":"like this place .
small cozy , with great pizza. 
Good for 2 and more people.
has Vine selection ,but not to big ."}
{"text":"A little slice of biscotti heaven. With only 30 minutes to spare in the Strip District, we set out to find some sweets for the evening's dinner. Enrico nearly fell in our lap as we trotted up the block. It was either the smell of butter pouring out the front door or the cozy \"what's going in on there?\" street appeal that lured us in. Between the two of us we purchased everything from pumpking and fig and walnut biscotti to cannolis, lemon basil shortbread cookies, cream puffs and chocolate espresso tea cookies. Needless to say, this is the perfect place to visit if you find yourself en route to a tea-loving Italian family's house for dinner. Almost every dessert we purchased was crafted for dunking. 

This place is pretty cozy. Rumor has it they have a mini cafe with seating in the back (behind the kitchen)."}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem! Tucked in the alleyway next to Enrico Biscotti bakery , the café is easy to pass up as it's not well marked but if you happen to spot it you will be glad you did! The atmosphere I'd describe as rustic-you can see into the kitchen, the walls are brick and filled with pictures, it's very quaint. Both of my dining companions ordered the beans and greens-kale,canellini beans, garlic, and olive oil sautéed together-one added a fried egg to it,while the other added both a fried egg and chicken. They both finished the plates raving about it-also saying the rustic bread served with it was delicious too. I ordered the fig jam and mozzarella pizza. While only being a four cut pizza, it was a large four cut pizza but was so tasty I finished the entire thing! The fig jam added a unique sweetness to the pie and the mozzarella used on the pizza was excellent quality. The crust was thin and fluffy-very light. Many of the pastas looked good as did some of the sandwiches. This was authentic Italian at it's best. The owner was there as well and was very friendly. I've also tried the 
 rabbit ragu that was to die for and a prosciutto, mozzerella, tomato pizza that was excellent! It's usually a wait but never too bad. Seating can be very cramped at times-just be warned."}
{"text":"great bakery but the secret here is the cafe down the alley to the left.  Great soups, pizzas, pastas, espresso, etc.  Little taste of Rome in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"So like....am I missing something here?

We walked in the door, and the place smelled AMAAAAAZING, like a huge pot of rich chocolate simmering away.  I was super psyched to eat some biscotti - we got a half dozen, and they were very well priced (like $7.50 for six, i think?)  All well so far.

So then we get home, eat dinner, and we are pumped for dessert.  How surprised and disappointed we were to find that the biscotti were totally plain.  Though we had gotten six different, very unique-sounding flavors, we could not distinguish one from the other.  The texture was great, but it tasted like what I can only describe as \"plain biscotti.\"

I'd love to give more stars to a local business, but like....it was just plain.  Barely a hint of flavor.  I'm totally not making this up or trying to be bratty or snobby - I'm not exaggerating at all.  The stuff was totally boring.

I see another reviewer here said exactly what I said, so I know it isn't just me.  Maybe we've been on a bad day?  I'd be willing to give it one more try, but if it's plain again - then me and Enrico's are done."}
{"text":"i've got to say that this is 100% the best place i've ever been. the atmosphere is wonderful and you feel as though you're in an Italian neighborhood. the music and service is absolutely lovely and everyone is so energetic. the food was delicious, and the servers and owner were incredible."}
{"text":"Find your best cup of coffee and eat these biscotti with it.  As everyone knows, I LOVE places that specialize in one thing.  Therefore I love the Enrico Biscotti Co.  The black pepper one was especially interesting/spicy.  YEAH!"}
{"text":"My Dad came into town for the holiday, so I thought a visit to the strip district was a must.  After we bought some necessities at Penn Mac, I thought it would be fitting to grab some biscotti. 

Walking in, you are surrounded by the smells of an old Italian bakery.  Multiple flavors of biscotti await your purchase - if only I could buy them all!  We selected the chocolate almond, black forest, oatmeal,  and orange cranberry nutmeg (I think that's what it was called).  These double baked cookies are flavorful and crunchy, just like you'd want in a good biscotti.

I noticed a sign above the counter that said \"If you come in at 10am (pajamas allowed), you can learn how to make this biscotti...\"  For  $85, you can learn from the biscotti master and take home your creation!  That's a perfect date night (or morning)!  I know the hubs and I will be signing up for that class and learning how to make amazing biscotti.

My dad and I had a great trip to the strip and he got to take home something sweet from Enrico.  It was a great day!"}
{"text":"Im a biscotti fan and Enrico's is legit. Great biscotti and friendly staff.
Almond anise was off the hook. Get some."}
{"text":"This is a must for those biscotti lovers out there! They had about 20 different flavors of biscotti to choose from including almond, which was very tasty!"}
{"text":"I found the bakery to be very pleasant. There is a very extensive selection of biscotti as well as some other baked goods such as scones.

One of the interesting things I noticed was that they offer a class with Enrico during which he shares many baking secrets with you. The class costs $85 per person. This seems like a fun opportunity for a baking enthusiast!"}
{"text":"If you're in the Pittsburgh PA area, you can easily stop into Enrico Biscotti and get a dozen or two of these delicious biscotti which Enrico makes himself every single day. Otherwise, you can just order them like most of us who can't get to the East Coast anytime soon. Enrico's biscotti are legendary. Although the original recipes were for anise/almond and lemon biscotti (handed down from his grandma), Enrico has expanded his flavors to include white chocolate, cherry, cinnamon to name a few. Order these lovely treats from www.enricobiscotti.com"}
{"text":"I love this place!  It smells divine and they make their own wine.  What more do you need?  Carlo's Garage Winery is located in the basement of the cafe and oh baby is this a hidden gem!  The grapes are from Cali and the wine is from the basement; it reminds me of stories that my grandmother would tell me about her Italian relatives who make wine

I am a fan of their Americanos and cappuccinos and their biscotti and oh my everything.  The people are so friendly, even on a busy Monday-before-Christmas lunch rush.  I can't wait to go back for an actual meal in the cafe."}
{"text":"Attended a private dinner, six courses starting with pizza, pasta, roasted Brussel sprouts, rosemary chicken, fantastic assortment of deserts and I know I forgot a dish but this was fantastic and I rarely ever say that. The service was impeccable, If I lived here I would return again and again."}
{"text":"A nice, old school bakery and cafe in the heart of the Strip district. Although it's not among my absolute favorite bakeries in town, they've got some nice selections to choose from. Living nearby, I make a habit of dropping by Enrico's every once in while. The bread is hearty: rustic, massive loaves that could feed a family of eight or more. Biscotti are tasty. Plenty of other pastries available too, although they tend to be on the sweet/dessert-y side. Super, super friendly staff. Haven't tried the cafe."}
{"text":"My Pittsburgh friends love this place on the strip. So many delicious choices! More than just biscotti but I only purchased biscotti. I took it to my office staff and it was gone - just disappeared. Lots of happy smiling faces in the office that day. There are so many great places to eat on the strip. Be sure to park close so that you can return to the car and drop off purchases and keep shopping!"}
{"text":"I only got biscotti from the biscotti side. Flavors were good, consistency was meh. I don't know what it is about my experience with PIT, but I thought the Italian food was supposed to be better than what I've been getting.

For some reason, it was just overly crumbly. It fell apart, like dust. Perhaps it was the humidity?"}
{"text":"Visited The Enrico Biscotti based upon an Anthony Bourdain review of Pittsburgh places you had to visit. We walked into the cozy bakery and were immediately greeted by amazing smells, visual overload of pastries that all looked too good to eat and a staff that was warm, inviting and extremely helpful. The young man behind the counter asked if we had any questions and made some suggestions to us as we perused the options. Given the name, a biscotti was definitely in the cards and the chocolate chip coconut biscotti proved to be a great selection. The biscotti had the crunch you'd hope for and had a smooth and rich taste to It. The coconut was soft and matched the chocolate nicely. The other selection was for the lemon blueberry scone which offered a zesty component to the sweet blueberry and pastry flavors. The scone was delicate and rich and paired well with a coffee.  Prices were very reasonable and we could have spent a lot more there as the entire bakery had options that likely would have been as good as the two we selected. There was a cannoli cake which was a round cake with cannoli filling in the middle, chocolate and cake topped with a whole cannoli that I will be having good dreams about; would love to here a Pittsburgh review of this cake!"}
{"text":"Enrico's is what is right about Pittsburgh and is a must do on a Saturday afternoon and every first Friday of the month. The owner, Larry, is the quintessential host, the food is fresh and local and the staff truly care about making your experience a great one. Chef, Kate Romane, who typically prepares the First Friday dinners, other parties and off site catering, uses only the best ingredients and somehow makes every dish comforting yet different enough that you will never forget it. The atmosphere is beautiful and rugged and is like no other in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"So...it was our last day in Pittsburgh, so we decide to head to The Strip for breakfast. The place we were going to had a line out the door, but we saw a sign for breakfast across the street. We'd had Enrico's biscotti before, so we figured what the heck. 

When we asked what's for breakfast, the hostess/server handed us a hand-written menu on the back of a lunch paper bag. 

We asked Enrico if he makes whatever he feels like for breakfast? He answered with a smile, \"My house, I can do what I want.\"

Hubby had French toast and I had the breakfast carbonara, which is pasta loaded with bacon, egg, and cheese. 

Another customer asked the server how many slices of French toast, and Enrico answered, \"How many you want? How's that for an answer?\"

The homestyle, tasty food and down-home feel will definitely bring us back."}
{"text":"Making our way out of Primanti's the next stop on our list was another stop well thought of by locals - Enrico Biscotti Company.  Featuring house made, old school, all natural, hand cut Italian treats I rather expected to enter a large rustic space full off cakes, cookies, and confections - and to that end we most certainly weren't disappointed.  Greeted by a friendly young man as we watched two young ladies cut biscotti in the back I asked about a number of items that were not clearly marked and the three of us eventually settled on four separate options.  Paying with credit (I was actually amazed how many spots in the Burgh were cash only) we made our way to the car and drove to the National Aviary where we'd enjoy the desserts while waiting for the exhibits to open.

Having heard great things about the Chocolate Ravioli I'd ordered one - or at least I thought I did.  Taking a bite we'd clearly received the wrong order as the filling of the crisp and buttery shell yielded candied lemon peel.  Tasty, sweet, but definitely not what I'd expected.  Moving on to the next taste, a dish described as \"Strawberry Soft Biscotti\" we were yet again duped, but this time in a good way.  Sweet and cakelike this \"biscotti\" was most certainly not Strawberry but instead a sweet and complex amalgam of maraschino cherry and pistachio.  The best of our four options and also the most filling of the group I was quite happy with the biscotti while my mother and sister remained underwhelmed.

Moving on to our second pair of selections, the drier of the options, we started with the \"Banana Walnut Biscotti.\"  Tasting minimally like banana, less like walnut, and mostly like a good sugar cookie all I can say is that it was nicely textured plain biscotti - I'm not sure if this was another mistake in our order or simply a lack of pronounced flavors.  Following the biscotti was a \"Blackberry drop\" Scone - a sugary biscuit with lush pockets of butter and thick whole blackberries - it was excellent.

Throughout the rest of our visit to Pittsburgh we would see Enrico Biscotti at multiple markets, bakeries, and shops - clearly they are not hurting for fame or business, even if they are hurting for competent help at home base.  While none of the items we had were bad, only the scone was more impressive than an average quality version of the same thing at any good bakery - perhaps we just went on a bad day or perhaps we ordered wrong...then again, perhaps we ordered right and just got the wrong thing?"}
{"text":"Can I live here? There are no words to how amazingly incredible this place is. 

We came on Saturday for a bachelorette party. It was a nice twist to your standard bach party. It is pretty quaint and unique inside.  First, let's talk about their wine... I had the red, it was not sweet, but not dry. Right in the middle and it was perfect! They kept it flowing, but made sure our waters were always filled and kept us hydrated. I appreciate that! 
They had a nice little appetizer set up for everyone with fresh charcuterie, cheeses and fresh bread. 
Next, salad. So I would like to tell you that I did tell them in advance that I do not participate in eating animal products. No problem! They were so nice in accommodating my needs. They asked us about food allergies and made sure everyone was getting what they wanted. They served a nice salad and gave me a bowl with one just for me with no cheese! How awesome! I attached a picture! 
Now to dinner, they served roasted chicken with fig jam and I believe penne vodka. The girls said everything was amazing! It looked super yummy. For me, they gave me a plate of penne with a slight spicy red marinara, YUM! But, my favorite part was this steamed kale with onions, carrots, beans and this corn meal topping. I am so sorry and sad I did not take a picture, it was sooooo good I dug right in! It was seriously amazing, the woman who made it came over and told me how to make it, I cannot wait to give it a try! 
Now to dessert and after dinner coffee selections.... They had some cookies, macaroons, cake pops and more! Everyone said they were super good and they had to go boxes for everyone too! I am OBSESSED with their americano, to say the least -- I had 3! Haha I love espresso and this might be the best espresso I have ever had. 

Now to making the bread, first I want to tell you about the attire. We were all a little confused on how to dress. But, it is such a fun, casual atmosphere; don't feel the need to get super fancy. Heels are a no, but booties will be fine. Don't worry about getting dirty while making the bread, they have aprons! You can be super involved in the bread making or not at all! It's totally up to you. It was super fun and Max was so nice and patient while he talked all us girls through the making of the bread. Some girls never probably bake, some all the time. So it's truly a night out for all different types of girls, moms and so much more! 

I cannot wait to come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing biscotti bakery in the Strip District.  The front is a bakery, but if you walk back down the side alley to the left of the building they have a super casual café.  

They make everything fresh, including the dough for the pizzas, etc.  They have fantastic simple flatbread-style pizzas and sandwiches, salads, and pasta dishes, all excellent, and a lot of vegetarian options.  

This place has interesting strip district character and you MUST go there!  I think they're closed on Sundays.  

After you have lunch there, go down a few doors and go to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for all your imported Italian food needs."}
{"text":"I am hooked.  I have stopped two times in the last week and a half.  The biscotti is perfect.  What else can you say?  But the Brownies...I was surprised.  I decided to try them and I am in love!  They are different.   It's like they are overcooked on the outside (but not really), a little crunchy (I don't think that's the right way to describe them either) and they are moist and gooey on the inside!  Oh my goodness...it's brownie perfection!"}
{"text":"I just had my first Enrico biscotti today and YUM! I'm definitely hooked! The white chocolate Macadamia nut is delish!"}
{"text":"This review is limited to the bakery only since I did not dine in their cafe. I was so thrilled to have found this place after sampling one of their biscottis at Yelp's recent airport event.

They were surprised to learn that a business out there sold their baked goods but delighted that it brought me in. While biscottis may be their mainstay they sell other pastries, pies, cakes, cookies, gluten free items, and even Italian bread round loaves.

Everything is made in house. Some biscottis come prebagged for travel but they are smaller and you don't get to choose.  You can also get bags of broken pieces for an assortment.  Full ones sell for $2.00 each but you can get 6 for $10.00. I was told not to refrigerate them. I didn't need to wrap them tightly when I got home. All I had to do was keep them in the bag and it would last for a long time. 

I chose 4 different flavors to make up my 6 including cherry, lemon, macadamia nut white chocolate, and a pecan filled one. As I was finishing my order I heard the baker in the back say the macaroons had just been taken out of the oven so I immediately purchased the apricot one for $1.50. Literally it was so soft, warm, and had that fresh taste about it.

Some of the items they sell require refrigeration so I would recommend either stopping here last when visiting the Strip district or bringing a cooler. When I got home I broke into part of the cherry one. It was fresh, crunchy and broke off easily. I will be anxious to see how the others hold up as I consume them over the course of the week.

Conveniently located on Penn Ave near 20th St you are in the heart of the business district. Only problem has and always will be parking. Metered street parking is your best bet if you want to save some money."}
{"text":"My husband and I always make this our first stop when we are in Pittsburgh. The food is always good and the ambiance charming on the patio. BYOB makes it even better as we can always have our favorite wines with our meal. The service is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where I read that Enrico Biscotti was the place to get to in the Strip District but wow, were they right. These are some magic dang biscottis. Crisp, flavorful and very, very tasty. Well made, they hold up well despite a brief dip in the coffee cup and then a munch. Perhaps a little crumbly but that's what a biscotti is supposed to do.

I got an assortment. Walnuts, chocolate, almonds, all sorts of great stuff. I don't have a favorite - they were all excellent!"}
{"text":"Ok so where do I start? Greens and beans? Pizza? Sandwiches? Biscotti? How about all of it and then some??
When I come in here I want all of it, all at once.
I will say the apricot biscotti is my absolute favorite and I like taking a bag home. Perfect with coffee in the morning."}
{"text":"Yum! I'm glad we stopped here, they had the best biscotti I've ever had. There were a ton to choose from, and I can personally vouch for the pumpkin walnut. The prices were good, and the biscotti were fresh and the perfect texture."}
{"text":"Have you ever been served by someone who's drunk? Well....I have.... 

I'm not talking about your drunk friend wobbling over to hand you a plate of food out of her kitchen. Or the bartender who's drinking along with you. I'm talking about an actual server at a restaurant...for lunch. 

If I didn't find it so amusing I would have been SO irritated. Thankfully, it's just one of those times you're just a spectator in a funny comedy of errors. I've been served by this woman before, and it seems that she may be an owner or manager. Someone who's obviously able to imbibe on the wine during work hours. Oh, and she was definitely tipsy last time...this time....it was party time drunk! 

So Drunky McDrunkster kept forgetting to bring us our drinks, our water and our bread. She also messed up our orders by forgetting what they were and then running back to find out what we had asked for. Then our orders came and both my friends \"sangaweeches\" where wrong. They were gracious enough to just eat them and not care. They agreed that they weren't bad, but they weren't t life changing either. Everyone wants a life changing meal! 

I've been here once before for lunch as well and wasn't too impressed. I got the pasta vodka the first time and it was ok. Not mind blowing...obviously how I like my pasta to be! 

This time I just ordered an anti pasta salad. I thought it was an interesting twist to add dried cranberries and walnuts with absolutely no cheese (boo!). The bread was actually really delish! That was probably my favorite part...well...other than the drunk server. 

The really surprising part about McDrunkster is that the wine they sell is NOT good. They've started to make their own and it just tasted as if the ingredients didn't mesh like they should. I've meet a couple wine's I don't particularly like, but I've never meet a wine I can't even stand to sip. I'll take my cheap Yellow Tail if that's the case! 

So more power to you lady, if you can enjoy your job, with a bottle of wine included daily. I just don't think I'll be back to eat. Maybe just spectate!"}
{"text":"This was one of my stops during my first visit to PA's Strip District.  They offer a variety of biscottis, some even unique.

The biscotti here didn't have enough crunch for me.  They also offer a few other baked items that I didn't get a chance to try.

This is definitely a place to try out if you're visiting, not sure its a place I would frequently return to.

An order to-go type of joint."}
{"text":"I love this place! The bakery is in the front. But walk down the aisle on the side of the bakery and you will discover a restaurant. A trattoria. Sit down. Relax. Order a pizza. A dish of pasta. Or a cup of coffee to dip your biscotti in. Everything mixes and matches in the back. Ask for Larry- the owner!"}
{"text":"\"How long will these keep?\"
\"I suppose a few weeks since all the moisture is gone, but we've never had any last that long.\"
Sold.

These biscotti are outstanding. Lemon and cinnamon are our house favorites. Entering my humble abode with my bi-weekly, two bag order from Enrico's biscotti, you would think I was returning from a multi-year military campaign, ushered in with a hero's welcome, celebrated as though I conquered ISIS, North Korea, and Nickleback all in one battle. 

But seriously, this biscotti is the real deal. Saddle up with some strong coffee (or splurge on some whole milk if you're my kid), and enjoy.

Oh yeah, the coconut macaroons are the jam, too. Those don't make it home. Mama has got to do Mama sometimes."}
{"text":"They have A LOT of different types of biscotti. They even have ones for your dog.
I tried the cranberry pistachio, which was good. But the only thing is - it gets stale really quickly. I tried a bite right after a bought it and it was baked perfectly - crunchy, but not hard to eat. When I went to finish the rest of it a couple of hours later, it was already kind of stale, which meant buying some to bring home was not an option. So if you do go to Enrico's, my advice would be to enjoy the biscotti immediately!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch and we're so pleased. Their Malbec wine is absolutely delicious. At $40 a bottle it's worth every drop. Be sure to bring some home with you. We had the opportunity to chat with Enrico. He was so hospitable and generous. He let us finish off our bottle of wine without charging and gave us free biscotti and coffee with out mean. I had the Italian wedding soup that he had just made that morning, it was a little salty but very tasty. His homemade bread is to die for! For $80 you can take a bread making class. As a main dish I had the gig pizza. It came with quite a-lot of fig jam that Enrico also made. I took some off and ate it with my bread. As an out of towner this is a must eat! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The menu is a great mix of classics and originals. Our breakfast was a mix of eggs, bacon and salads that we never would have expected. Head up the alley and treat yourselves!"}
{"text":"Chocolate covered macaroons, oh my.  I think I died and went to macaroon heaven.

And yes, the biscotti is delicious, too.

They close at 3 p.m., so you'd better get your sweet fix on early.  But the aroma alone is worth it."}
{"text":"Fun and affordable with great atmosphere.  Hidden off the main strip of Penn Ave next door to Enrico's famous Biscotti Co bakery is this tiny, casual, Industrial-revival restaurant.  The owner will acknowledge you immediately as you enter and will make you feel like a welcome guest in his home.  Our group of 4 had to wait 15 minutes, so the owner (Enrico, perhaps?) gave us a free bottle of table wine, which was light, dry and good.

The menu is short, but rest assured that everything is good.  Each person in our party of 4 got a different dish and shared it.  There wasn't a dish I wouldn't order again.  I got the stew which, surprisingly is not broth-based but includes fried potatoes with onions, sausage and spices.  It's dern hearty.  The lasagna was very cheesy and indulgently good.  The pasta fagioli comes in a large portion.  All dishes came with a side salad."}
{"text":"This review is for the bread making class. I had heard great things from a few friends about their Sunday brunch + bread making class and had been wanting to try forever! I finally pulled the trigger, splurged the $85 per person and reserved a spot for my husband and I. So so glad to have this experience! 

We walked in to the cafe and there was a long table with wine, water, and table settings for about 14 others. We were greeted and showed where the coffee was which was needed at 10am. A few short minutes later we were given an overview of our morning - brunch first followed by bread making and the history of bread told throughout. The staff began to promptly pass around brunch which was served family style and it was seriously amazing - so so SO much food and an endless supply of both red and white homemade wine. 

Today's brunch was sausage with potatoes and peppers, penne with red sauce, lox and hard boiled eggs, biscuits and gravy, berry French toast and bacon, breakfast quiche, and breakfast risotto with poached eggs. The quantities alone made my mouth drop- there was more than enough to go around for everyone + seconds (if you can finish your first plate). The food was incredible - the absolute best French toast I've ever tasted and the breakfast risotto was outstanding. I don't even know what was in it but I know I'll have dreams about it for a long time. 

All the while, you're being told stories of the history of bread while you're eating and drinking and the staff is incredibly friendly, catering to you along the way but staying silent enough so you can be captivated in the story of bread. 

Then we moved to the kitchen and began making our loaves. Each person makes their own rustic Italian loaf. The dough is prepared in advancebut the rest of the forming and baking is up to you (and as I learned there is much to it to get the perfect loaf)! Once your Italian loaf is in the oven, if there's time you also make focaccia and there are a plethora of toppings to go with it. 

While the bread is baking, you then learn how the dough is actually prepared and how you can translate these techniques to baking the bread at home (not in a beautiful wood fired stove). Once the bread is finished you take the fruits of your labor home and that's a wrap! 

Honestly it was an amazing experience and I'd love to do it again (even for just the food). Between my husband and I we left full, happy, learned some interesting history about different cultures and their experiences with bread, and with 4 loaves that we baked in the shop. It was one of my favorite activities I've done in the city and most certainly worth the money (especially if you're a wine drinker)! Would absolutely recommend for couples, friends, family to try it together -you'll leave feeling so cultured! Very much looking forward to returning to the cafe for brunch and trying another one of Enricos classes in the future!"}
