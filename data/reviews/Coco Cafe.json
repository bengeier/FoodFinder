{"text":"Went to coco for a samdwich. Service was quick and polite. The tuna melt is good. It is pricey but the entire building is in the same range of 7 to 9 dollars for a sandwich. Overall, recommend if you are in the building."}
{"text":"Its very specific to the building.  I don't suspect many people that don't work there would even know about this place or take the time to find it.  Its a simply little cafeteria style restaurant.  Pricing is OK, and the food is reasonable.  I've only eaten here once and was not too impressed, but as I am now in the area I am sure to go back.  Its fast and there in a pinch when you need a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Too adorable! Such a sweet place to hangout & drink your hot cocoa (which was so smooth & tasty)...so many items to choose from and definitely a place that locals can come & enjoy! I like that it's shared space with ENVY next door so when I'm finished having breakfast or lunch, I can go shopping!! The store layout is very impressive when you first walk in. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab coffee or to eat breakfast or lunch the place is well designed and welcoming I had a latte with almond milk which was great and oatmeal was delicious. Will sure go back to try more stuff. The staff was friendly and welcoming and I even got a free muffin and a punch card to get a free coffee after the 10 order. Thank you Coco Caff√®"}
{"text":"Note: Coco's is located in the west tower on second floor just by the elevators.   Coco's is pretty good.  They're pretty pricey for offering sandwiches and breakfast bagels, but I think everything in the Sussex Centre food wise is pretty pricey because they are the lunch shops for big businesspersons and it's probably safe to assume the employees are well paid.    Though the prices irk me, I can't deny that the food IS pretty good.  I still don't think the prices are justified, and therefore it loses a star, but I definitely ate their more than once.  (Okay, more than a few times.)    It loses it's second star because sometimes the service was inconsistent and I would select things on the menu that they just didn't have, several days in a row.   But if you're in the Sussex Centre for an interview, or anything else for that matter, you might want to consider stopping in and judging for yourself."}
{"text":"They have outstanding bagel sandwiches. Those beauties could be filld with proteind and cheese. Actually, the protein option impressed me so much. There is infused lemon water for everybody in the house free of charge. Great quality and upscale prices. Quiet place that is not overcrowded."}
{"text":"I had a turkey sandwich and my friend had the sriracha chicken wrap. Both came with a side salad.  The salad good, the sandwich and wrap were mediocre.  It took 25 minutes to get our food. When ordering, it took a good 10 minutes to even be acknowledged and then another 5 minutes to place the order and make payment.  Decor is nice.  The only person that was good was the sweet old lady doing EVERYTHING while a young man was on his phone most of the time. I believe even the owner, a skinny tall lady, didn't even say \"hello\" or \"we'll be right with you\" when we were waiting to place our order and we were RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER.  never again."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic Apple Brie  Croissant.  The people here are so friendly and the food was great. Start out here at the back of the Town Square shopping center and be fueled for shopping! & its right across from Valet parking so give valet the keys & get something great to eat & a yummy hot drink"}
{"text":"I came here to study with a friend. It's spacious and cool, so it worked well, so it's a place to revisit.  They have a variety of healthy and filling options aside from pastries and coffee. We were there in the afternoon, so I got a fruits and vegetable smoothie instead of coffee. It wasn't so, busy, but they're food prep can take awhile when there's only one person. It's understandable, because this isn't McDonalds. Again, it's a place I'd return to...especially if it's for a quick healthy meal at Town Square."}
{"text":"Nope, never again. My husband and I walked in and there was a woman behind the counter. She walked past us a few times before greeting us. It took about 10 minutes to get an order in and we were the only customers in line. I ordered an iced chai tea latte (which is on the menu), but there must have been some confusion because an older woman replaced the other girl and finished the transaction. For whatever reason she explained to me what a chai latte was (chai syrup and milk). I thought it was strange but I told her, \"perfect, that's exactly what I want.\") That's not what I got... I received an overly sweetened chai flavored water. I took a couple sips and threw it away. What I don't understand is, why tell me what the drink is and then not make it that way?"}
{"text":"Really cute new place! Decided to stop in while wandering around, and I'm glad I did. Ordered the chai tea iced, and it has a nice creamy flavor. Not too spicy or sweet. Really milky and smooth. I'll make sure to be back often! :)"}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but I guess that salad that is supposed to come with your $9 sandwich, is only available if you dine in which is super disappointing since you have to extra for a bag of chips and you paid the same amount for dining in as you did taking it out. It's a cute place to hang out and grab coffee or tea though."}
{"text":"First time i have been here,  Very beautiful nice elegant coffee shop.  The workers are SOOOOOO nice. Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"You can pretty much get anything from this place for a lower price anywhere else. They do have Lavazza, which is a finer quality coffee, but they'll make sure you pay the finer price for it. Also, all their pastries are from Sam's Club. Those will run you about five times as much than just getting it at Sam's a club yourself. To cut it short for ya here's their Three U's:  Unorganized, Unoriginal, Unethical."}
{"text":"This is a cute restaurant in what looks to be a brand new outdoor mall. They have a variety of breakfast and lunch options, though nothing really stood out to me. I got an oatmeal and shake and my husband got the roast beef sandwich that came with a small salad. The food was good, though the oatmeal tasted instant, but nothing memorable that I would return to this spot in particular for. My one year old loved the chocolate nana shake and he's a tough sell! I wish the older lady working was a little more friendly, but it sounds from other reviews that she does most of the work which was the case on our visit as well, so I understand if she gets burned out. The other women working were polite and welcoming though. I hope they are successful in the future and perhaps just working through some kinks as it appears they are brand new."}
{"text":"Cute new cafe Great friendly customer service Nice seating and layout I like how their prices are not ridiculous when it comes to desserts and pastries Got a macchiato and a chocolate bundt cake, both were tastefully served Definitely will be returning everytime we go to Townsquare"}
{"text":"I don't know why they thought it might taste good to put strawberry jam in my parfait. That really weirded me out. Also, my pastry was cold even tho they \"warmed it up\" since I don't live here, I'll never come here again. Thanks tho"}
{"text":"This is a little deli type place located in the Sussex centre. Similar to select sandwich, the prices are quite high. A sandwich will run you between $7-$9 but they do give you A LOT of meat and toppings. They also have lots of hot dishes to choose from that change daily, plus salads, sushi, fruit cups and veggie cups.  They also do food for meetings. I have ordered the wraps many times and both the hot and cold wraps are delicious. The hot wraps have grilled zucchini, eggplants, etc with the meat (or vegetarian) and the cold wraps are more tomatoes, cucumbers, etc. I've never heard a complaint about the wraps and when I could eat them, I remember them as being delicious!  They also serve pastries for meetings and the standard coffee and tea. Their prices are a bit hefty when it comes to \"takeout\" meeting food, but they are stingy so it kind of makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"The chicken salad sandwich was fantastic----------the greek garden salad was very fresh-----the cucumber alone was worth the price of the meal----the person behind the counter was very nice and friendly,,,,,it was very very clean and a beautiful facility-----if you are at Town Square I highly recommend it...........and the sweets counter ( I did not indulge) looked amazing"}
{"text":"Apparently as of yesterday at 10 am , they are closed, for non payment of over $200,000 in rent . We tried to go after the Grant a Gift for Autism 5K ."}
{"text":"Came her on a Wednesday afternoon, the weather was great, and was looking to try something new. Great location, convenient to all who come to Town Square. Did the $10 for $20 deal offered through Yelp. Our total was $30 something so using the deal, we only had to pay $11 in the end.   Upon entering the cafe, it was not busy and the decor was nice. Indoor and outdoor seating. Great variety on drinks and food items, as well as the desserts displayed right in front of you. We ordered the Pesto Panini with chicken, as well as some smoothies. Don't remember the names, but one has spinach and mango, while the other had pineapple and some other fruit.   Food: food was great! Came out warm and in a timely fashion despite how busy it started to become. The paninis were warm and fresh and the mozzarella would be stringy, exactly how it's supposed to be. The smoothies came out few minutes after and tasted just as good as I thought it would. Definitely a healthy meal!   Staff: the guy working was friendly and attentive. He apologized for the food coming out late and asked if we needed anything else. He was the only one working and it became kind of busy, rush people coming in all at once, maybe at least have two people working during the afternoons especially. Traffic seems to come a lot by Town Square employees during lunch time. Having an extra set of hands will definitely help!   Overall, definitely will come back and try their other food items and possibly a dessert next time!"}
{"text":"Found this cute little gem in town square today before I popped into work in a Sunday morning.  The food was good the coffee strong and I like how it's situated in the middle of a clothing boutique.  Definitely will be back for a quick bite and coffee."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have ordered from his twice through Postmates (which is pretty good.) the first time we ordered we received our order a little late than what the postmates app said but completely the driver not the cafe.  We got the salmon bagel sandwich and the chicken salad sandwich, a medium vanilla latte, and two smoothies. They were pretty good! I wish there was a little bit more cream cheese for the salmon bagel but overall it was delicious!  Last week we tried to look for this place when we went to Townsquare, couldn't find it, but it was probably just me and my bad driving!  Anyways we just ordered from here today for our lunch later! But so far the food and drinks have been really good!"}
