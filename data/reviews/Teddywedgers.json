{"text":"Not good. Not good at all. The new owners SUCK. And the Wedges are gross. What happened? :("}
{"text":"A Monument to Madison tradition the recipes keep the same traditional pasties and friendly personable service behind the counter. I've been going here for six years and it always has been a staple comfort food. Service and flavor have only improved."}
{"text":"All I have to say is ew. I got a big cheese (as recommended) it was cold and kind of soggy, not the best thing. I threw it away after 4 bites. 

The guy behind the counter was weird. He creeped me out. Kept looking at me weird and i was super uncomfortable. 
Also, there are like, a ton of homeless people hanging out right out front. It's super unnerving having to wade your way through them just to buy a crappy pasty. 

Definitely not worth the effort. 2/10 would not go again."}
{"text":"We did breakfast. Service was quick and super friendly. Told him we were from out of town and he took care of us. Could not think of a better way to start a fall day than walking downtown Madison with a hot B-2 in my hand. So good."}
{"text":"Chicken Pot Pie wedge is the best pot pie I've ever had outside of Georgia. Always hot and always delicious."}
{"text":"I got the traditional pasty which has beef, potatoes and onions and it was just as good as the first one I had back in 1980 when there was a Myles Teddywedgers shop on E. Johnson St. It's good to see there's still an eatery from the \"old Madison\" I remember. I will definitely be back to try some new pies especially the breakfast pies."}
{"text":"The restaurant is under new ownership, and just reopened in the last couple weeks.  The previous owner carried the recipes over from the original owner, Myles.  They were excellent authentic Cornish Pasties.

This new owner must not have gotten the pasty recipes in the deal.  They currently only have a couple breakfast pasties and one lunch menu option, the ground beef pasty.  So I went withe the ground beef pasty.

This pasty was like eating an unseasoned dry hamburger wrapped in slightly overcooked pie crust.  There was no hint of potatoes, onions, or anything but ground beef inside it.  The portion size was about half the size of what the original pasties were.  This actually was fine since it took a full can of soda to make it through the size that it was because it was so dry.

I will not eat there again.  I can't wait to see what will take its place next.  Too bad since Teddywedger's has been in that location for decades."}
{"text":"I read some of the other reviews after having gobbled down my pasty and my experience at Teddywedgers was very positive.  I did notice some of the other reviews were quite old and maybe things have gotten better since then. I have nothing but good things to say.

I didn't know what I felt like eating for dinner tonight but i was walking by Teddywedgers and the \"handpie\" Sign enticed me to go in.  The smell of fresh baking pastry and roasting meats and veggies met my nostrils as soon as I stepped in. The woman who was working there was very friendly, kind, patient, and she explained all the different options to me.  I decided to get the traditional but it was a hard decision because several of the pasties sounded really really good. I was offered a whole or a half of a pasty  and I got the half and I'm glad I did, because it was huge and very filling.  I was not disappointed. The crust was baked to Perfection and was light & flaky with perfect browning and the inside was juicy and delicious. I am so glad that I stopped there.   Yummmm"}
{"text":"Very good.  Well done crisp, but not hard crust.  Great tasting ingredients.  I loved the  ground steak and potatoes in the Traditional.  The ground pepper makes for an excellent little enhancement to the well rounded flavor.  

Definitely a great place to go repeatedly.

It's a togo place so don't expect a table.  Just some friendly people ready to help you out."}
{"text":"I visited Teddywedgers for lunch on a recent weekday. It's a tiny store on a triangular corner with no seating right across from the capitol. However, if the weather cooperates there is plenty of seating outside on the square. 

The menu consists of a variety of pasties. I was not familiar with pasties so I asked the cashier what they were. The cashier, who was friendly and congenial, showed me a 1/2 one which looked like a calzone and said the traditional ones are filled with meat and vegetables. He recommended getting just a half order for myself. That was an excellent recommendation as I was stuffed by the time I finished my half.

I opted for the cheesy pepperoni filling. It was fine, but to me it was just a calzone. Perhaps if I would have gotten a traditional filling I may have thought it was more unique.

The price was great. The cashier was great. It was certainly convenient. I wasn't impressed with the product."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive (there's a difference between inexpensive and cheap) pasties which are greater than the sum of their parts. If you read the menus available on the counter, you'll notice the pasties don't have a large list of ingredients; they're simple so you get an idea of what to expect. Each time I've tried a kind for the first time, it exceeded my expectations.

I recommend the chicken pot pie or the veggie wedgie for lunch, and the B-2 for breakfast. But be sure to ask about the daily special, too!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive, fast, and filling.  If you need to grab a quick meal for breakfast, lunch, or an early dinner and you're near the capitol, this is a safe bet.  There's lots of good places to eat downtown, it's a real tragedy of too many options, but Teddywedgers is one place that's definitely worth a try and then many returns.

This place only serves various kinds of pasties and drinks, and seating is all outside.  If you're just getting one for yourself, go for a half-pasty, a whole is too much for one person.  I mean, you can eat it, but you'll get the regrets that come with feeling uncomfortably full and thinking, \"I really should have only gotten a half.\"

Personal favorites are the traditional and the corned beef hash pasties."}
{"text":"I love pasties and was excited to see this place in Madison. I grew up in Michigan, which has great pasties, and I used to live in the UK, which also has great Cornish pasties. Whatever this guy is selling, it is not a pasty. It was tasteless vegetables wrapped in soggy, raw (undercooked) pizza dough. Such a shame, so much potential and just so disappointing."}
{"text":"Simple, tasty pasties. The new owner is kind to all, engaged with the downtown community, and has added a lot of nice touches to the shop - It's a must when you're downtown Madison!"}
{"text":"I tried the chicken pot pie pasty. This place is a safe bet. It won't give you something earth shatteringly great but it won't be awful either. The service is great. The cashier is super chatty and friendly. The pasties are served hot and are very filling. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time here since the original owner passed. I was happy to see they still have the B-2!  My favorite breakfast item ever.  It is smaller than i remembered it, and was a little bit cold, however it was still very good.  You can't beat eating one of these on Capitol square in the morning.  Glad to see the tradition is carrying on!"}
{"text":"I wrote a review for this place a few years ago, and apparently it was deleted, I didn't even find it in the \"not recommended\" bin. I suspect it's because my review wasn't very PC. Nowadays, if your opinion isn't all sunshine and rainbows, then you are censored. 

After placing an order we stepped outside and immediately accosted by a large homeless man who asked for money. We didn't have any cash and told him so, so he demanded \"THEN BUY ME SOME FOOD MAN! I'M HUNGRY!\" 

We hurried away as he continued to yell at us down the street. 

For anyone who claims that this experience is not part of Teddywedgers, I beg to differ. Teddywedgers doesn't have any inside dining space, and while they can't be responsible for random panhandlers shaking down customers as they exit, you can't say this isn't part of the \"atmosphere\" either.     

It's a shame really, because the folks who work there are nice enough. 

As for the food itself, we ordered 3 pasties and they were drowning in red sauce on the inside, which neutralized any other flavor that might have been in there. 

Definitely not worth the time or the hassle."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time because I've never had a meat pie before. I see a lot of reviews complaining that the ownership isn't as good as the old one, but I don't have that point of reference.

I really enjoyed my visit. It's a really simple carry out counter, and they offer just a few different varieties of these \"pasties.\" My pasty was a huge, hot, flavorful pie just gushing with slightly saucy ground beef with cooked celery and hearty potatoes. My favorite part was the crust; it's a thick, flaky but hearty pie crust. Overall, I found this to be somewhere between a pot pie and a calzone.

The best part is how cheap this thing is. You can get a half for $5.50 or a whole for $9.75. I found a half to be plenty of food.

I will definitely be back simply because it's so cheap and convenient while being relatively tasty. Too bad they're not open late; it would make a perfect late night food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the sausage breakfast pastry. I just wish there was a place to sit...it was raining outside."}
{"text":"One week ago I ordered the salmon Teddywedger.  Thin, rip-off filling with a few miniscule pieces of salmon was what I received.  It won't happen again.  I have learned to stick with the \"Traditional\" pasty, consisting of lean ground beef always thoroughly cooked, and potatoes, served hot.  It's adequate.  For condiments, salt and pepper and ketchup work for me.  Someday will sprinkle on some hot sauce if feeling adventurous and may try some other Teddywedger versions."}
{"text":"Was hungry not expecting much of this hole in he wall! The wedges  where very tasty and good! Hearty breakfast and lunch ! It appears to be a local spot! I would come back! The owner Ali's very friendly inquired about our road trip from CA to NYC."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try out this place for a couple of years now and finally got here.  It didn't disappoint.  I got the sweet potato veggie and it was great with chunks of sweet potatoes, black beans, corn, and I think some peppers.  I got the half size for lunch and I was full for the rest of the day.  Some spots in the crust were a little soft from the moisture on the inside, but I don't know how that would be prevented and it was kind of a nice complement to the flaky crust on the outside.  You can't dine inside, but it was so nice outside that that wasn't even a consideration.  

Also there is a very nice hot sauce selection to add to the dish.  I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"They were about the only place open on thanksgiving morning. Bread plus cheese equals awesomeness."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, well made comfort food. HUGE portions. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"A State Street staple. The pies have a great crispy crust every time. The fillings are made from good quality ingredients but could use a little more seasoning sometimes. I'm still giving it four stars because the food is a great value and savory; it's always very satisfying after a long walk down state street on a weekend morning. Even a half-order will give you some leftovers.

The question of service is somewhat moot since it's 'grab-and-go' only, but the new owner is very friendly and talkative which adds a positive note to the brief ordering experience."}
{"text":"I love teddywedgers and eat here three times a week! $5.50 for a half pastie is a great deal, and more than a meal. Anthony who now owns and runs the place is a super- nice, chill guy, and is very concerned for customer satisfaction and happiness! They're hours are usually in the morning, and I love their breakfast pasties. 

My favorites are the B2, chicken pot pie,and the spicy traditional!"}
