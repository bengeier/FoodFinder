{"text":"First time at this board game cafe. My friend had called to reserve a table just in case it was super busy which it does later in the evening. Nice environment and feels comfy inside. Really liked how the tables are not too close to one another so you don't feel too crowded. They have regular tables, electronic mahjong tables and electonic darts. I would say they have a medium sized board game collection. The \"entry fee\" is pretty much just buying anything from the menu and they will let you stay 3 hours. If it's a really busy night they will tell you to leave but if not you can stay longer.  My friends and I had dinner here as well. I thought that their prices are a bit on the pricey side for the amount and quality. Most of the entree items are around $7.99 - $9.99 and most of them didn't appeal to me. I ordered takoyaki, 6 pieces for $5.99. It was meh, not enough squid in the filling and it was missing the brown sauce. Also got a matcha slush which was very good, not too sweet.  Tonight we tried a gamed called Tokaido and we loved it! It's an easy-going game but also involves strategy (and also very pretty!). It was missing one small token though, but thankfully not a very important one. I would totally recommend it to anyone. We also played a game called Coup and noticed the cards were very sticky and gross to touch. I would suggest bringing some hand sanitizer if you are a germ freak.  Overall a pretty nice place to hang out with your friends. Good service and waiters are nice. It can get pretty noisy when there are more people though."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out. Very friendly and welcoming environment. They have discount on food and drink Mon-Thur. Might be a little too noisy during weekends."}
{"text":"Tucked into the edge of a business park, UDT&M is a nice alternative to the busier bbt options around Warden & Steeles. Parking is still limited, given it's in a business park complex with spots just ringing the outer edges of the building. Inside the Mao-esque decor is gone, and it's more like a simple modern tea house with the same tables and benches, some couch seating, board games, magazines, comics and Foosball.   Lunch specials are 11:30-2:30pm, M-F and it seems fairly quiet mid afternoon, and the (English) music isn't too loud in the background. The food menu has good variety but the majority of selection is in the drinks; typical bbt offerings plus some interesting options: egg nog, fresh fruit/veg juice, yogurt and yakult. Drink specials are in Chinese-only, so you may need to ask for translation. Service is friendly, and if you need wifi just ask for the password!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible.  It was my first and only time I will ever go.  It was way too noisey so it was hard to have a conversation or learn about a game as a group - you had to almost scream to hear each other.  For food we ordered chicken wings and popcorn chicken, which both were extemely salty and the slushy drinks we also ordered were way too sweet.  We were quite unimpressed by the games selection and the game we chose looked uncared for and dirty.  The women's washroom was absolutely disgusting - the minute you stepped into the washroom the stench of urine was prominent, the toilets looked like they had not been cleaned in ages and one of the toilets handle to flush was broken and had a string you had to pull to flush (you definitely did not want to pull that string to flush with your bare hand, that's how gross it looked).  We tried to give the place a chance, but we ended leaving after being there for only an hour.  We ended up paying $60 for crap.  Though the best part was when I went to go pay by debit, I did not put any tip in as I was extremely not satisfied with anything (including customer service) - as the lady who rang me in gave me my receipt she told me that my total did not include tip and that I needed to put a tip in, I was dumb founded that she even asked and thought I heard wrong so I asked her to repeat it and this time she said if I was happy with the service.  She looked at me and gave me back my receipt on the receipt tray, so I took it and went back to my table and told the group I was with, what had happened.  Everyone was shocked, so we left the paid receipt tray there with no tip, since they were not deserving.  As we left out the door, the waitress actually came running out telling us that we did not leave a tip.  We could not believe that she actually chased us out for a tip!  When our friend responded to her no tip, she asked why not and I blantantly told her we were not happy with anything there or the service and if she realized, we did not even stay long.  The waitress just looked blankly and went back in.  Are you serious?!?!  I am not stingey and working in the customer service industry I am very concious of leaving tips to those who deserve it, but they definitely did not deserve it and obviously know that in their debit machine you can opt out of putting no tip, so to ask for a tip (and especially chasing us for tip as we are out the door), is extremely tacky, rude, ballsy and definitely undeserving!  I am a big games person and I have gone to many gaming cafe's, so this is not my first rodeo, this place was the worst I have ever gone too, i will even say worst experience in general, ever!!!  I do not recommend this place at all and will never go back again.  Absolutely, disgusting place, food and service.  No stars at all are deserved, I just was not able to put an option of nothing on Yelp."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night with a group of 7. This was a great place to grab bbt, play board games and catch up with friends. They also have food, darts, and mahjong (probably additional prices). I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Washrooms are a little gross but place is great aside from that. It's well decorated and has a nice medium sized selection of games to choose from. You obviously can't compare it to the huge selection of board and card games at Snakes & Lattes but games at Utopia are still decent to play. This cafe also has mahjong, poker and darts to play, which makes up a bit for the difference in game selection.  House rules requiring every guest purchasing food or drinks every few hours are very reasonable considering that they make money off that to stay open. It feels almost as if their business exists because they simply want people to have fun and not because they're trying to make a lot of money.  By the way, please don't order the rose carnation aloe tea from the flower hot tea section. That drink was just so bitter even with the sugar syrup. The honey tangerine tea, on the other hand, was excellent."}
{"text":"9 pm on a Saturday, there are about 7! Empty tables but we can't get seated because they're all reserved for people who aren't there. But we could come back at midnight! For a group of 3 people. Seriously wtf.  Last time we went we couldn't get seated because they said they didn't take reservations.   Don't bother with this place!"}
{"text":"I cannot begin to express how upetting this establishment is.  From beginning to end this experience was a living NIGHTMARE.  I am absolutely livid.  I walked in with 7 friends, 8 of us in total.  A server sat us down and we only observed the games on the side.  No rules given, no explanation.  After taking a few moments to look at the menu, two friends and I decided to order. We had just come from a large dinner and the rest decided to pass.  To summarize, our \"waitress\" did not come back until at least 15 minutes later.  She became heated and EXTREMELY rude when she realized not every single one of us would be ordering.  She proceeded to mention that my friends, two who were black and one who was brown, would have to leave the premises OR they would have to pay a fee of $5 each to use the board games. It was also mentioned that her \"boss\" was watching, whatever the hell that means.  There were many tables available and our group was not being rowdy or obnoxious in any way possible.  Mind you, 100% of the customers there were Asian and my friends felt extremely uncomfortable already.  There is no doubt in my mind this is an act of full on discimination and racism. I observed the way the server treated the other tables. There was a clear difference, as she frequently visited those tables and spoke in a softer tone.  After the three of us who ordered begrudingly resided, she threw the bill trays down and called someone else to take our money. We had only stayed in order to not cause a scene, but seeing as my drink which tasted like Febreeze and was served in a shitty quality plastic cup cost $7, this is my biggest regret.   To Everyone: go to Chatime down the street, your time will be better spent.   This hellhole needs to shut down immediately."}
{"text":"I thought the drinks / food was a little overpriced (compared to other board game cafes) for the options / quantity. I liked their tapioca though. Board game options were also more limited than a lot of others (not bad though), although I appreciate their comparatively large selection of Chinese board games for the demographic that needs those.  They also don't require two fees for board games (ie pay for board games + drink order, which I know some places like snakes & lattes do), just the order.  Staff was nice, we stayed a little longer than 3H (the limit per order per customer according to their menu) and they didn't kick us out or anything. Tip: Don't order the mcao Oreo cake, it's not worth (literally just cheap whipped cream and Oreo crumbs). Waffles when we went was also a little too soft."}
{"text":"This place is really bad. The food took so long to come, and the rules are plain stupid. The plates and glasses were disgustingly dirty and it is really loud in there. Not to mention that they only have one machine! The deserts aren't even that good. I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've visited this spot twice over the past month and a couple of times when it first opened. They have a pretty grand selection of games, but they have definitely worn down in quality overtime due to usage. Many of the games we picked out, such as DixIt, was missing several game components leaving us to awkwardly substitute pieces to make it work. The drinks themselves are relatively subpar and are all served in plastic/paper containers. If you are eco-concious, this place is definitely not for you. The staff do what has to be done, but don't expect them to go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. My friend was harassed over a tip; I don't believe she will be coming back. Given the availability of cafes like this in Markham, it's decent but it has a long way to go before it can be considered satisfactory."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place to kick back over games and asian snacks. Liked the fried chicken balls and all the fried snacks except for the chinese sausage which was so damn sweet. Loved the tea selection. Game selection is good. But twas my first time at board cafe so dont have a bar of comparison. Would come back though cuz this place is good for kicks with friends. Too bad no beer though."}
{"text":"Super loud, not many games. If you do find a good game it's hella sticky and sometimes missing pieces. The waitress got all my 3/4 drinks wrong so another waitress had to help us fix everything.  Super loud Asian populated board game place. Yea, o and my boyfriend got a belly ache"}
{"text":"The plaza is at the southwest corner of the intersection and the cafe is towards the back of the plaza. The atmosphere is pretty laid back and the cafe has a cupboard of board games, a separate cupboard of magazines, 2 darts machine, an old jitz table and a few mah jong tables.   The menu holds no surprises - your standard mediocre bubble tea options and quality reflects the same.  But of course the main attraction is the items listed above - and with the least expensive drink at $3.99, this is a great place to play board games with a bunch of friends. Unlike the famous Snakes and Latte, no additional fee is required to play board games.   There are a wide variety of board games/card games here. While about half the options are Chinese games, there are still a lot of options ranging from your standard Settlers of Catan to a few zombie games. Since the cafe isn't really new, a few of the games look pretty battered but the few games I played were not missing any pieces. One of the card games I picked up was missing 1 non-crucial card out of a deck of 120, so overall I'm impressed. There's rarely anything to do at night in Markham so the cafe (with fairly late hours closing @1am Mon - Thurs) is great for the low price.   The only thing I have a problem with at Utopia is that the washrooms are pretty nasty. Maybe it's a lack of maintenance or cleaning but there's a pretty bad stench and I usually avoid using the washrooms when I'm there."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst cafe or whatever you want to call it, I've ever been to. The waitress was extremely disrespectful and rude.   We were seated there for a good 15 minutes, completely confused on what's going on in this cafe because the waitress just left us there. We were not made aware of their \"rule\" that each person who steps foot into their store was required to purchase something.  After just leaving another restaurant and finishing a huge meal with my friends, a few of us decided to pass on getting drinks/ dessert.    I understand that every store has their own rules, and my friends and I were happy to obey them, but the way the waitress came off about it was extremely unprofessional. When we told her that only 3/8 of us were ordering she started to get upset with us. \"Well everyone has to buy something, or everyone is going to be charged $5 because you're using the board games\"   Well first of all we were not even using any of their board games, we were just all siting there confused as to what was going on. Were we suppose to line up to place an order? Are we suppose to sit here and wait to get served? THERE WAS NO SERVICE, so we just assumed it was like a lobby/ food court kind of deal.  The cafe was filled with empty tables, we were not disturbing any of their customers and we were NOT taking up room in their Cafe as half of it was empty. So my two friends and I just ordered and told the waitress we were just going to grab the drinks and leave the store, like a take out kind of deal.   She leaves and comes back 5 minutes later with 2/3 of the items we order and said, \"The people who didn't order have to leave the store right now \". I was absolutely upset at this point, I was like well, one of the orders didn't even come yet so they're just waiting with us, we will pay as soon as we get our order and leave the store. She threaten us saying that \"her boss\" was here so if the people who didn't purchase anything don't leave immediately she would charge us $5 extra for each person.   Taking into account, everyone in the store was Asian expect for 3 of my friends who were brown and black. As we looked around the store, not everyone ordered something... Why was she just strictly picking on our table?  She was so polite to all the other guest at the other tables, making small talks, asking if they needed anything else, taking away their garbage. My friends and I were polite when we walked in, we greeted her, and we were not being loud or disturbing. Discrimination? Maybe?   So moving on, when the last order came my friend found hair in her sundae! That is disgusting- both the service and food. I paid $7 for a regular size cup of bubble tea which included the rude \"service\". When we went to pay she just threw the bills on the counter, walked away, and asked another guy who worked there to collect our payment. None of the staff said thank you or bye, nothing.   Above all, please don't waste your time and money here. If you don't want someone to ruin your day just don't go there. If you're looking for a place to chill just go to Chatime which is like literally a 1 minute drive away. It is a much better atmosphere, friendly staff, and cheaper bubble tea. This place was hell just don't even bother going there."}
{"text":"My friend and I walked in and waited to be seated but instead we sat ourselves in the cafe. I was accustomed to being served. I found it really awkward having to get up from our seats to take our menus up to the counters to make our orders. The rose tea was delicious and their black bean noodle was amazing! I would give it a 3.5 since the food was amazing but the service needs to be more attentive."}
{"text":"Love coming here for board games as this is one of the only board game cafes near me. They also open very late on weekends.They have quite a wide selection of board games, including the most popular ones and chinese ones. There are also a couple mahjong tables. Theres a lot of seating in the cafe and I've never had to wait. The food is not pricey, but it is not cheap. Only downside is it can get cold inside, probably because they don't turn up their heat."}
{"text":"Very Nice Place to Meet Friends and Have Fun! Hundreds of Games Selections, Free to Play, Drink and Food Are in A Very Low Price Range, And Are Very Delicious Too. There Are Private Rooms If You Don't Want to Be Bothered."}
{"text":"My brother has been headed to a bunch of board game cafes, and has been recommending them to me. One of those recommendations was Utopia.  Went in during a Friday afternoon, so it was very busy but had a couple tables around. Definitely was decorated and catered to an Asian market, serving bubble tea and even having some Chinese board games and mahjong tables.  Food and drinks weren't bad overall. You can't really screw up a Green Apple Green Tea, but it did come in a cheap plastic cup you'd get for takeout. Popcorn Chicken were good, as they weren't too salty, and the cucumbers were great, but definitely NOT worth $4.99.  A medium selection of games on the shelves, but use to the gigantic variety at Snakes & Lattes, so was a bit underwhelmed.  Good overall experience, but found it a bit too quiet at the time we went. Felt that we couldn't talk to loud there... Not a bad place to hangout, but probably would head to another cafe in the area."}
{"text":"Food/Games: 4/10 -- Value: 5/10 -- Service: 4/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 5/10  This isn't a very good board game cafe.   It fails for me because there are too few games and too few good games.   Half of them were foreign and didn't look remotely interesting. Some of the games in English were missing instructions or pieces. There were a few popular English games, but most of the other ones seemed like variations of Apples to Apples. They just weren't fun. It's easy to buy small board games to pad your numbers, but are these actually quality games?  It fails for me because of the atmosphere.  Lots of really loud yelling in Mandarin. Every surface is sticky. There's not enough ventilation (and the weather is cooler these days!) and it's hot and stuffy inside.   It fails for me because of the service.   You just feel very rushed by employees who are counting down the minutes to three hours so that they can ask you to buy something else. Each person has to buy one thing every three hours. And good luck flagging anyone down after they've taken your order.   The food was perfectly fine; at least we can give them that. And they're super expensive because they expect you to be there for a while. We had popcorn chicken, green tea with honey, mango slush, strawberry yogurt drink, and house special milk tea with tapioca. The strawberry yogurt was room temperature, which was really weird. The house special was $7.50. You don't even pay $7.50 for something good at Cha Time.   This place may be the biggest board game cafe in Markham (their claim; I didn't fact check this) but it is nothing compared to any of the locations downtown. I would rather plan a day downtown to attend Snakes & Lattes than come back to Utopia. Staff there actually make game recommendations and I prefer the food there."}
{"text":"Drinks are not cheap but I guess you have to make up for the games somehow right? The waitresses always look exhausted and I don't think I've ever seen more than 2 servers running about. I feel bad sometimes because they look so overworked but at the same time I really just want my goddamn menu .  My green apple green tea was $4.49 + $0.50 for tapioca and most standard drinks are in this range.  The food is eh but they put cinnamon on their fries which is really strange to me... As for the games, they are not well preserved and many of them are missing pieces or are entirely in Chinese (bonus points for bilingualism). Not as many as say FTW or Snakes and Lattes, but decent selection. Also have mahjong tables and darts which is fun. Basically a decent place in Markham for a casual night out."}
{"text":"Board game cafe on Warden north of steeles. I don't think there are too many board game places in markham so this isn't a bad place given its location. Omescape is nearby and has a lot more games, but I don't think they have food and it's $10 to play, so this place might be better.  There are a lot of seats, whether you want the booths, or some small or large tables. There are mahjong tables available as well. Washroom is no good however.  Their menu comes with a lot of different foods, drinks, and desserts. They have a rule that a drink only covers 3 hours worth of games. I don't know how they enforce it but presumably they'll come around at the 3-hour mark and ask you to buy something again.  Ordered an original black milk tea, but there wasn't much flavour.  Decent collection of board games. Lots of chinese versions of familiar games as well as english versions. Some games are worn or falling apart but they still work.  They have monopoly."}
{"text":"Perfect place to lay low and hang out with a group of friends. Good variety of games. I would say 60% of them are not in English and doesn't have English instructions. They did have other popular games such as apples to apples, monopoly (different versions), cards against humanity, Jenga, and more.   The food however is very basic and didn't really do me. We had the octopus balls, ice cream sundae, crepe, and bubble tea. Nothing was out of the ordinary, and tasted very plain. I felt the price was too high for the food we got.   The staff also was not very engaging with us. Even to order we had to call them, maybe that is common in a game cafe."}
{"text":"Great place for mahjong and board/card games in Markham. Downside is that a lot of the board games have been worn down from usage over time. The mahjong tables have an hourly fee, for the traditional tables they're $5 per hour and the automatic tables are $10 per hour. Relatively cheap compared to other mahjong places.   They also have numerous \"rule\" such as minimum one food/drink per person for every 3 hours and they automatically charge 10% service charge if you plan on going with a group of 8 or more. The service here isn't the best either, very slow. They also only provide you with a maximum of 2 cups of water per person if you decide not to get a drink. Also make sure to have cash or your debit card if you plan on coming here they don't accept credit cards.   Their milk tea here isn't the greatest either, taste just like powder but they do have a large selection of drinks and food here as well. They have entrees, snacks, desserts and soup. However, I wasn't a fan of their food either, haha. It may look good but the taste was far off from the flavour!   This place does have wifi though! ID: Utopia Dream Cafe Password: 7170 warden"}
{"text":"The experience wasn't the greatest here. When I first arrived the server is very polite and sat us down. But they never checked on my table after we got our order, a big no no in my books. I think it's strange if I have to get up and ask for more hot water. We ordered the waffles and tea. My god, the waffles were like taking spoonfuls of the desert. The green tea ice cream was freezer burnt, tasted like how it looked! I left 3/4 of my waffle, it was awful.   The board games were in rough shape, at least the ones I looked at. I have definitely been to better board game cafes with better conditioned games. The selection seemed wide enough.   The bathroom... I'm sure Killer Croc would have been grossed out by it.   I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times (all suggested by my friends) and I can't say I've enjoyed it. There are a fair amount of board games, which I guess is the redeeming factor.  Drinks are meh. I've definitely had better elsewhere. Atmosphere is LOUD. Everyone is yelling in Mandarin so you in turn, also have to yell across your own table to have a conversation (the vicious cycle of yelling). This in itself, isn't so bad. People who have been to HK cafes know they're just as loud. However, I'm here to chill and converse, and not just eat and drink, so it changes things a bit.   The tables just feel nasty. Sticky substances everywhere. Bring your own board games at your own risk because they will become sticky and gross. Service also sucks. You can never seem to wave servers down. When you do wave them down and get an order in, it takes awhile to get to you. I once spilled water on the table and asked for napkins. The girl looks at how much water is spilled (half a cup) and comes back with two flimsy napkins. Seriously? Are you that stingy with your napkins?"}
{"text":"This boardgame cafe. Has been around for a long time  and have been here a few times. The price of food is overpriced. The drinks are about average when it comes to boardgame bubbletea places. Although decor is nice. And the boardgame selection is plentiful. This place is chronically understaffed  Weve ordered food here. And it does take a long time when it is a busy weekend night. And food is largely inconsisent. It is very salty most of the time when it comes to the food. And popcorn chicken is overpriced.   The service is subpar. However most peopl come to this place for one reason which is the games available  and the comfortable environment.  The place has mahjong tables as well. Along with poker though i would not play poker here since its popular with teenagers and therefore loud. Overall as a neighbourhood place it is good. Since not overly pricey and offers variety of games. I would suggest thise around the area to go if they like board games"}
{"text":"Don't come here for the drinks - the bubble tea is way too sweet and tastes super artificial. This place also feels really dirty and tables are always really sticky. If you're desperate to play board games then come here, but you're probably better off playing t at someone's house."}
{"text":"Stay away! So many rules and the food is (in a nice way of saying it), crap. I have never been to a board game cafe-- let alone any food place-- as disappointing as this. Not impressed at all.   First, I was set off by so many rules they laid out for you. One, to which you have to purchase an item of food/drink every 3 hours, which is understandable. But the food is such poor quality! I will get to that later.   Another rule is that you are only allowed 2 glasses of water and no more. That raised a red flag. Is this even legal? You are not even allowed to bring your OWN water.   Okay let's talk about the food. I got the coconut toast (~$6) and the menu picture shows a nice caramelized top. I was so disappointed by what was placed before me. First off, what was on the plate, looks different than the picture. My toast had a giant yellow wet patch on top, and was confused on what it was. It smelled like butter, and was iffy about it, but I went with it. It had a mild taste of coconut, but it wasn't what I expected.  In addition to false advertising, the quality they have for food was the deal breaker for me that led me straight to giving this place a 1 star. 1) the bread was DRY AS HECK. As I cut into it, it was as dense as a pound cake and as tough as a week old bun. It was so dry that there were WHITE SPECKS on it! I could shred the bread apart with my fork. I don't even know if you can even find stale bread like this at the discount section of the grocery store. 2) As if it couldn't get any worse, my toast wasn't even toasted-- at all. It was a plain dry bun. So my coconut toast was not toasted nor did it have much coconut flavour. I was shocked. The fact that they were willing to serve such gross food says something about them.  My friend ordered a tapioca slush, to which tastes terrible. In addition, all the drinks were all served in plastic take aways. Which makes sense because if they can't afford to serve water to guests, they can't afford to wash dishes,  right?   Sure the place looks clean and decent, though very empty on a Sunday evening, with just 3-4 other tables filled. I wonder why the place isn't popular.   At least they were able to bend the rule of no splitting bills because it wasn't busy. I really appreciate that they didn't make me pay for my order, after discussing with them that I wasn't happy. That made things better and I considered bumping their rating to a 2/5, but I predict this place will go bankrupt soon. Asian places have low standards in general, but this is so extreme. I would not come back nor would I recommend this place, sorry!"}
{"text":"The drinks are not bad and the place is average, however, never going back there. Me and my friends went there and we got treated totally different from their Asian customers. All the Asian customers were sat right away and treated normally. For us, they wouldn't sit us right away and kept asking if we had reservations, even though the place was less than half empty. They took longer to bring us the drinks than other customers, and the worst is that they forced us to pay one by one the second we got our drink, which they never asked of anyone sitting around us.   So if you're not Asian, look for a different place, they don't want your business."}
{"text":"Third time. They're down a set of English Catan. Sad.   Food: Ginger milk green tea ($4.99) - there's ginger bits in it. The green tea is oddly floral. It makes for a very strange combination. I know green tea isn't supposed to have caffeine in it, but I didn't sleep until 4am last night, and it wasn't for lack of trying.  Veggie fried rice - I didn't buy it, and I didn't try the rice, but one of my girls (the one who ordered it) handed me a carrot from her rice, and it was cold. Not lukewarm, cold. She said that when she bit into hers, they were like ice cubes. I see a big issue there. The peas in her rice were also bitter (as attested by multiple people who ate her rice). Curry fish balls ($4.99) - I believe there were six fish balls. They were swimming in curry sauce. Notice to management: if you put that much curry in a bowl, expect people to spill...on your games.   Service: Struggles with English. One of the servers bent really close to me while asking me a question about my drink, and her breath went into my mouth. It was gross. They didn't have onion rings in stock. I asked for separate bills. They told me they could separate my bill into four. I said that would be fine. They gave me one. Then, when they saw we were struggling with our bill (not fun to make change for 12 people), they told us they could split up our bill into three. At that point, I told them not to bother, as we had already figured out half of our bill.  Ambiance: Table size is an issue. We wanted a table for 12. All the chairs were right next to one another (so middle people trying to get out of their seats isn't fun). If you want to play multiple games, it's very difficult because there isn't enough table space, especially once you have food and drinks going. Tough."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this board game cafe so I decided to give it a try after a friend recommended it to me. It's a decent place to play board games uptown. We went around the afternoon around 2:00pm and it was relatively quiet. There is gaming fee but you have to order something and then order something every 3 hours you stay there. Gaming selection is limited here but they have some decent games. The place got busy later in the afternoon. The food and drink selection was okay and you can say it's very similar to a bubble tea cafe menu. There is also Mahjong there for those that like it. It's a decent place to play board games if you happened to be uptown."}
{"text":"Evenings + board game cafes usually = jam packed, hour-long waits.  However, at 10pm on a Friday night, my party was able to get a table of 8. Impressive.  They don't have a sitting fee - only a requirement that you get a drink every so often. Quickly browsing their menu, after skimming through the typical bubble tea line up, I came across something interesting. Utopia served fruit-flavoured yakult drinks. For those that don't know, Yakult is the probiotic dairy drink that comes in the small clear/red plastic bottles, commonly had as a snack as a kid. It's a little sour but sweet at the same time.  I had the large Green Apple Yakult drink with tapioca. +$1 for a large size, +$0.50 for tapioca. It was... alright. The green apple taste was too artificial and sugary for my liking, and I'm not sure I needed a large size Yakult drink. I'm happy I tried it, but it's not going to make a regular customer out of me.   On to the board games - they have quite a large collection. My eye test counted at least 100. The games appear to be in relatively good condition. The game we ended up playing was not missing any cards or pieces, which is a good sign. In addition to board games, they also have mahjong tables, a couple electronic dart boards, cards, and magazines.  One thing I found weird was that their menu says they will provide a maximum of 2 glasses of water per customer. Never seen that before. Oh well."}
{"text":"Honestly, I really wanted to give this place more stars, due to the variety of games, the roominess, the decor etc.  But it doesnt deserve recognition as a cafe if theyre this inconsistent. If I knew the food was going to be THIS bad, I wouldn't have even considered ordering any, and would've happily obliged just paying a $3.99 sitting fee. :(  Green Tea Buttercream Toast ~$4.99 -  It looked really unappealing, like bird poop plopped onto half the surface. The bread was wayyy too stale and wayyy too chewy (because it was slightly soggy - essentially if i grazed a knife on the surface, it'd be disappointing to hear; actually you wouldn't hear anything because there's absolutely no crunchiness). The green tea buttercream was the only source to combat the dry toast but was lacking.   Vanilla Icecream Waffle ~ $8.99 - I thought maybe in comparison it'd be much better than the toast. All's fair in redemption.. but no! The waffle batter was missing every single protein (egg) /dairy component in it I swear. It was so dry and dense that with every bite I felt like I could choke. I applaud them for at least knowing how to scoop icecream and cut up bananas and strawberries.   Why... just why...  We didn't really mention anything from the above, but even when asking for water, I had to go up to grab it since the servers were not very responsive. I can't believe they had the guts to serve us stale food and even so, we did not dare try out the bubble tea as dry as the food was and as thirsty as we were (plus my friend was a huge bubble tea fanatic - so that was a clear indication of how shocked we both were.)  .... Im just really envious towards my friends who've told me they had good snacks here.  I'll give it another chance..  sometime in the distant future.   TL;DR - food sucks, come here for games only"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends! They have an extensive menu of different drinks (bubble tea, Chinese teas, coffee) desserts (waffles, crepes), and savoury foods like chicken wings and fries. I had the taro milk tea with red bean (extra $1 for it) and it was good although on the sweet side.   They have a whole wall shelf full of different games. They also have poker tables. Lots of seating.   Service was fine.   It was very loud and lively which was fine with me. Some may be bothered by this though.  Overall, this is a great place to just chill out and have some fun! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered the same bubble tea drink. Both had sand in them, that was unacceptable.  Also, the washrooms were gross.  Service was so-so, waitresses didn't seem very happy to be there.  The games were disorganized, pieces were mixed from other board games and some were missing. And there was only 1 of each game.  It was quite noisy inside too."}
{"text":"A relatively fun place to be with friends for enjoyment.  They have quite the variety of board games that you will be able to find games that are the right fit for your friends and colleagues.  There are a few things that needs improvement such as quality of service and drink quality, but I believe that the price is probably a factor to why this might be the case.   It is very affordable in terms of spending a night out as pretty much for a drink per person, you are able to spend a couple of hours here chilling with friends. Tbh, the food is actually not too bad here.  For a late night snack, I think this is actually a pretty decent place to be.    I'm of the belief that this place should consider charging a premium, and if service and quality of food and drinks become similar to most bbt places in the area, people would definitely be long term clients and customers and would not mind the extra up charge."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem for board games - it's like a Chinese Snakes & Lattes.   The place is actually quite large inside with a selection of board games, poker, jitz and automated mah jong tables! (at $10/hour/table) The minimum charge is $3.99 which is pretty good as you can stay as long as you want.   To be safe, I ordered the Apple Green Tea which is not bad. Other orders were too sweet.   Service is pretty accomodating despite a slight language barrier."}
{"text":"+.5 Asian service is Asian Service. You go, you order, food comes faster than your boyfriend, you pay, and you leave. However, this place cannot even Asian service right. If i see you doing nothing but standing around for 15 mins in those cute leggings and i flag you down, don't you dare turn around and pretend to be busy, especially when we made i contact. If your going to rob me with these mediocre bbt and bargain bin food please do so efficiently   The selection of games was lacking. A very standard collection with nothing new or exciting. You have Catan, monopoly, risk, Cards Against Humanity, Dominion etc. Standard but limiting. Not a place to go to if you are hoping to find a new favourite game  The poker tables and the majong tables are what save this place. But good luck finding a seat because once that mob of asians sit down they are gonna be there the entire night.   Dont bother unless you plan on using the poker tables or majong tables."}
{"text":"The place can get really packed at certain times (I went around 8 ish), the space was crammed and the atmosphere was very loud. The menu didn't have that big of a selection in my opinion and the drinks aren't anything special, same with the food. The service was horrible, I waved the waiter a few times but was ignored and when we finally ordered it took them a very long time. The only redeeming factor was the selection of board games  wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Popped into this place as it's close to our office and it's a hot hot day (for once).   Ordered a mango slush and a passion fruit green tea.   The drinks were pretty good.   The thing that really irked me, as an animal lover, is a turtle in a really small aquarium. It looked like it was suffering.   For that reason I could never come back here.   I asked the owner why they had a turtle and he replied it was for good luck to bring in more money. Poor turtle. Wanted to report these guys but just didn't have the heart to do so.   Thus I chose to boycott it instead."}
{"text":"In all honesty, this is not the best place for food. I don't even remember what I ordered, just something sweet in a plastic cup. If you are here, it is because this one of the few board game places uptown and the food/drinks is just an excuse to access their game collection. The collection itself isn't bad, I've played four random games and all the pieces are there and in working order. They even have a helpful list on the side with the amount of time and number of people you will need.    The environment is hit and miss. If it is mostly empty, it is a great space to play and relax for a couple hours. However, if you are seated beside a rowdy group and the majong tables are going at double time, you won't be able to hear yourself think. The service is pretty much hands off the moment you order and have your drink/food delivered, so be prepared to wave them down to get their attention."}
{"text":"What a cute lil cafe! Unlike other board game cafes, there is no base fee to play--you're expected to order something from the menu, though. I went with a small group around 10pm on a Thursday and the cafe was virtually empty. The selection of games is quite large, but one of the reasons for my not giving 5 stars is that many of the games are missing pieces. The menu is quite expansive with plenty of drinks and desserts as well as a couple small appetizers if you're looking for something savoury. I ordered a mango slush and french fries from the menu. Mango slush was good, nothing special but nothing to complain about; the fries were seasoned nicely and were crispy and actually very good, which was a pleasant surprise as I was suspecting them to be average. The service could be better, as most of the workers seem uninterested and they do not check up on you. Washrooms could also be cleaner. Overall, though, I enjoyed my visit and would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"So many people on weekends...... The place is great for casual gatherings with friends when you want to enjoy rounds of board games or have loud chats in general. It's perfect if you're looking for a vibrant environment, because the place is super busy and sometimes you have to yell over people. Food wise the place is pretty average. Bubble teas can't compare with real teashops like Chattime, but the price is like them... They offer a large collection of both Chinese and Western board games, plus majong tables. Be sure to ask the server for pokers because they don't keep them out"}
{"text":"Went here this afternoon just to chill. The place is nicely decorated and spacious with a ton of board games on a couple tall shelves and a good amount of seating. It was empty when we were there in the afternoon.  Service was good. Not everything might be available - we wanted a mango shaved ice (snowflake on the menu) but they didn't have it so we got a matcha red bean one instead. The portion was decent though the dessert itself tasted mostly like ice with a hint of matcha. Not nearly sweet enough and didn't taste that good.  We also got a mango slush with tapioca and this was okay. It wasn't mixed very well as I think they soak their tapioca in sugar water and so the bottom was where all the sweetness was. The slush itself tasted fine though the tapioca took some time to chew and was harder than usual.  Overall not a super great experience but could be a good place if you want a drink and somewhere quiet to do work as there is free wi-fi. It was also a little awkward because there was zero music and also no one except us and the one server."}
{"text":"A great place to relax and hang out with your friends while playing board games. The minimum purchase per person is $3.99 which, compared to other board game cafes, is cheap!   It is quite large inside so finding space is never an issue. There is a slight language barrier for service but it has been consistent.  They have an electronic darts machine, electronic mahjong tables and lots of board games. A lot of the board games are Chinese, but the main favourites are there.   The menu is your standard bubble tea menu - nothing pops up or is memorable but that's okay because people are really there for the games, anyways!"}
{"text":"I've come here on a regular basis for the past 2 years. It hasn't changed much really except for the addition of board games and now they take reservations.   The food, like any typical bubble tea shop, is overpriced. The food itself is subpar and if I were to rate this just based on the food I'd give them a 2. The bubble tea is powder based with lack of any strong taste or flavour. The tapioca isn't terrible, but doesnt stand out either.  However, the selection of board games makes up for it. There is at least 4 shelves overflowed with board games.   If you are planning to stay longer then 3 hours, you do have to order another drink. I don't fault them for that, I always wondered how they made money if I ordered one drink that night and sat at their table for 4+ hours. Glad to see this place is doing well."}
{"text":"The good: the great thing about this place is the price. All you have to do is buy a drink and you get to stay for a limited time (I think three hours), and the drinks are at a fair price and doesn't taste all that bad. However...  The bad: in terms of environment... It feels nothing like what you would get at the other prestige board game places. It's losing its character. On the one side you get this fancy chalkboard wall (pretty cool) but it's paired with a brick wallpaper (alright...), and then you have a weird counter that doesn't know whether to hide the kitchen/staff area from its customers or not. I just felt it was off...  The ugly: but that wasn't the worst part.. The board games are either super old or the pieces felt like they've been touched tens of thousands of times. Some even felt like they were falling apart. Had to make sure to wash my hands and sanitize after touching those pieces.  Neutral: great for groups, they have lots of big tables. Good for mahjong, has a card table, and a few good selection of board games. It's open late, which is nice. Bring gloves if you want to play board games though ;p"}
{"text":"Aside from the previous review, the service here is really really subpar. The waitress was taking our order and pauses to take a call from her personal mobile phone.. what kind of waitresses do that?!?   The drinks are still expensive and taste mediocre.   One cool thing is they have really innovative mahjong tables that help you stack it together."}
{"text":"Like this place, although we came on a Saturday afternoon at 2 when it wasn't busy.--don't know what it's like when it's crowded. Hard to find if you don't know it's there-- it's around the back corner.  Decor is college crowd grunge. The stand-out menu item, of course, is bubble tea (\"boba\"), of which they have an awesome selection, but they also have food-- the spicy soup was superb."}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday at 1pm wig a group of 9. The place is good for large group. They offer many different board games, but I don't know if it's free to use.  They also offer mahjong, automatic align table is $10/hour; traditional table is $5/hour.  Do not expect good food from this place,  but the drinks are yummy.  Food price is pretty expensive too, plus a drink on a side you are look at around than $18.   Service was so-so. They don't have many staff to serve, probably didn't expect people comes in for lunch/food?  The waitress wasn't very friendly while the waiter was better.   I would go for a drink and some chit chat time, def not food."}
{"text":"Environment was great with a nice ambiance, however it was quite noisy and all the smoothies or non-herbal or teapot drinks were way too sweet. When I bought their mango milk smoothie drink I barely drank it because it was way too sweet & you can easily see the sugar settle about 3/4 of the cup of you leave it sitting there for a while.   Excellent place to just relax with a group of friends if your interested in both Asian games like San Guo Sha or English games like Munchkins. Although I highly recommend not getting anything with too much sugar if your drinking late at night."}
{"text":"Trash. The drink gave me and my girl a stomach ache. The server was aight tho.  Only the red head. Other server was shit got all 3 drinks wrong."}
{"text":"Came here for board games late at night on a tuesday night with some friends. Stayed here til close which was at 0130. Their game selection was pretty good, but their service was terrible. There were missing markers in some games, but they couldn't necessarily replenish the dry erase markers.   They also weren't clear about minimum seating price. They also forgot one of my friend's food orders. Their drinks were okay, their dessert was okay, but nothing special.   Still a really good place to pass time and have some friends play games."}
{"text":"I always have a great time when I go with friends. Typically I go with a large group, about 8 people. Love playing resistance. Perfect for big groups. Staff are great and always make Good recommendation. I get the mango drink. So good. Gets pretty full on weekends and nights."}
{"text":"For a Saturday late night hangout, it's a pretty good place. Tons of boardgames to keep you busy all night.  This bubble tea joint is mostly for rich chinese kids that drive expensive nice cars. Therefore a lot of the boardgames are Chinese games I've never seen. Thank  goodness they have Monopoly and Jenga!   Parking is ok. It's always packed at night.   Haven't tried their food but so far, the drinks were only ok. It tasted very powdery and sweet.   I ordered the large Rose Milk Tea and by the end of the night my drink was still 3/4 full. (That's how bad it tasted..LOL)   We came here as a group of 5. Each person is required to order at least one drink. We ended up staying for 3-4hrs.   Overall, I would definitely go back - it's a fun way to spend a Saturday night :) but next time I'll order a small drink or food instead."}
{"text":"i know this dish is a rip off already for what it is, but i like having it everywhere i go. scrambled egg with shrimp on white rice.  most of the food items are decent here, you can give it a pass. but their version of the scrambled egg + rice was a disaster. not only did it come out as something different the past 2 times i ordered it, but when my order finally came out right this time. it tasted nothing like what i expected it to taste like. it just taste like oil, very minimal seasoning.   anyway, they also made some changes that are notable, which i have nothing against because they do need to make money somehow. 1 order per person per 3 hours. it's fair. in the past u could stay there forever and only order one small item.  and now that is is busy pretty frequently, i think the charge is fair."}
{"text":"It's a board game cafe, not a restaurant. Simple selection of games and OK food and drinks. It's a go to place for late night fun with friends."}
{"text":"I don't think this place is half bad! My friends and I ordered some dishes and man they were so good! We got the creep, lobster balls, squid balls, and the seafood udon. The board games are free so without paying for food, you can play with the board games... but I think it would be nicer if you did buy something. They have a variety selection of boardgames, and it's also a pretty chill place to hang out at."}
{"text":"Utopia Dream Tea is now under new management with a brand new look and new menu."}
{"text":"Super popular and awesome board game store! So many varieties and we played zombie mall."}
{"text":"Used to be a great place with great service, but my most recent experience with them was less than stellar.   My friends and I called ahead to reserve a table, and the waitress told us that she would reserve a table but only for 30minutes. We got there in 15 minutes and she told us that she gave our table away. To add insult to injury, after waiting 20 minutes and snagging the first table we saw, she told us we couldn't sit at that table for long since it was a large table (a table for 6 and we had 4 people in our group) so we would have to relocate once a smaller table opened up.   The only good part about the subpar service was that she took so long to even come over and take our order (45 minutes) that we almost didn't have to buy anything (usually you are required to buy something every 3hours)   Finally, upon cashing out, when I went to leave a tip, I decided to leave a tip less than 10%.  After I paid and everything, she proceeded to tell me that I had to pay at least a 10% extra tip, and made me pay the rest of the tip in cash to make up for whatever I didn't tip. I asked why they didn't just add in an extra service charge of 10% on so that everyone has to at least tip 10%, but they just stared at me and didn't answer.  So all in all, go in with low expectations for service, but hopefully you'll have a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"Not bad since there are not many board game cafés in Markham; however, not the best selection of games or drinks. Have gone here a few times at off-times and it has not been too busy. Drinks are nothing more than  mediocre. Have had a variety of black teas and milk teas and none were very impressive. Reason for low rating is that last time I went there were a few games that had a horrible smell, almost as if someone had thrown up on the pieces. Overall not a bad place if you want to try a few new games but it is definitely worth the extra travel to go somewhere like snakes and lattes."}
{"text":"The only thing I remember from my visit to Utopia was the rancid smell coming from almost all the board games. No it's not because the games are old but because when customers eat and play the games at the same time they touch the game pieces and boards with their greasy hands, the food grease gets transferred to the games and overtime it really starts to smell. Especially when the game boxes are closed the bacteria inside really does get a chance to cultivate and stink up the game so when you go to open it you get hit with the odour from unsanitary games. Monopoly was the worst."}
{"text":"A nice game room tucked away in a plaza with free parking.  Great menu with lots of drinks and food to choose from.  I got iced green tea, and have to say it's one of the nicest iced green tea I have gotten in a while.  The taste is so nice and fragrant. My friends and I decided to play Monopoly.  The board game version was unfamiliar to me. Actually it was very worned down and the board was literally torn in half, so we had to be careful not to agitate it too much, otherwise objects on the board game would be out of place. Sanitation was lacking.  The floor was a bit sticky, and the washroom.... ew.   There was also a time limit placed on staying there to play games - 3 hours. We only stayed for two hours, but since the place was not jam packed, i didn't think it would matter much, but that's just me guessing."}
{"text":"Small little dainty place. Hard to believe where it's actually located as the plaza is a small dark area that doesn't look too safe. Inside is really spacious and very comfy. The place is very clean and service is okay...waiters don't really understand English but the job gets done.   The selection of board games is somewhat limited but overall food is good. Drinks could be better and prices are slightly high but as there is no sitting fee, it is very good. I would definitely want to play mah jong next time.   Definitely would go again and recommend it to someone looking for a place to hang out."}
