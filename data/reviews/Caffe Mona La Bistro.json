{"text":"Delicious, friendly staff, cool atmosphere, all around great experience! They have a pretty great selection of crepes and omelettes, among other things. I enjoyed the Cherry Omelette (cherry tomatoes, swiss cheese, potato slices, and bacon) which was pretty big and cooked perfectly! Nice side salad and bread as well. Coffee was great and our server was warm and polite. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Very positive and nice ambiance. Caner and the rest of the crew are very friendly.  The menu has a wide variety of crepes and omelettes. Mediterranean omelette is particularly my favorite. I tried pesto as for the crepes, and num num and berries for the desert. I enjoyed all the food I had  each time. I would recommend this place for having pleasant time, thanks to the very friendly staff. Keep up the good work guys!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee (even if the espresso is Italian roast instead of French roast, which we usually prefer) that is clearly made with care. The three of us each had a cappuccino, one regular, one a little dry, and mine as bone dry. All three were clearly made differently and exactly as we wanted and ended up ordering one more each to finish off our breakfast, which leads to the food. We're vegetarians and got the Goat omelette, the Veggie egg sandwich and the Mocha French Toast. All were quite tasty and the French toast was pleasantly NOT cloyingly sweet. 
Service was a little on the slow side, but that was because he spent so much time on each of our coffees. Had we not ordered dry caps, I'm sure it wouldn't have even been noticeable."}
{"text":"Our first time here for breakfast. I had Brie and apple Crep which was delicious and my husband had madetranean omelette. Both dishes were fresh and delicious and beautifully presented. Coffee and juices were fresh. Our servers Eto and Connor were friendly. This place is clean and warm. Would love to go back with friends and family."}
{"text":"Oh man, I hate to do this but:  The food here is simply not good.  I had the \"Remember the Alamo\" crepe and home fries for brunch recently.  I don't know who they think they're fooling, but the guacamole scoop that came on top of the crepe was store-bought - and not even one of the higher end store-bought guacs.  It was inedible.  To make matters worse, the \"home fries\" were...steamed or boiled or... I don't know what they did to them, but they were most definitely not fried.  They were just slices of mushy potatoes.

I really want this place to get it together.  When it was J'eet, the food wasn't especially great, but it was good enough.  My advice:  learn to work with fresh ingredients and learn how to make home fries.     

The service was by no means stellar, but it was acceptable and the restaurant itself is cute.  They really could have something great if they tried a little harder."}
{"text":"I was just Googling breakfast places in my neighborhood and stumbled onto this place.

One word: Pierogi crepe."}
{"text":"Very rude. 

Last weekend we stopped by for breakfast. The place was full. The curly haired waiter didn't even offer us a wait time when we walked in. Instead he said, We're full right now. Sorry but...it's not a good time. So we just left.

Despite the lack of care, we decided to try again today. We were standing next to another family who was waiting to be seated and looking at the advertisements on the wall. The curly haired waiter came over to tell them a table was ready. The woman, who was cleary older, did not hear him. So, the waiter decides to say \"whatever\" in such an annoyed tone, and walks away. I was so shocked at how rude he was to this family!  

The food wasn't anything special. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. We went for brunch on a Sunday. We weren't in a hurry, so the wait for our food wasn't a problem, but it did take surprising long."}
{"text":"Came here because of the cutest umbrella decor and it turned out to be just as exciting as we anticipated! Caffe Mona has both indoor and outdoor seating, but make sure you come on a sunny day to enjoy the outdoor back patio. The umbrellas do an amazing job at keeping it cool. As well, the location is not in a busy area, so despite being outside it is still extremely peaceful. Such a nice change up from similar restaurants in lawrenceville or southside. As for the food, it was so delicious! Service was fast and attentive. Overall, a very relaxed atmosphere. They have a very unique style with their restaurant that remains true to their business. They even bring the checks in a wooden box...such a cute touch! We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"a very \"Ben Folds Five\" kinda vibe...I can't stand BFF...but in this case...Perfect mellow Sunday morning Bistro. Food tasty and fresh.."}
{"text":"In sum, I do not recommend eating here. In fact, I feel I am being overly generous giving it 2 stars. I felt, since my picky brother enjoyed his strange meal that I should at least give it 2 stars. If we are to base it solely on my dish and that of my friends- a one star would more than suffice. That being said, I have to wonder if I should have eaten something other than crepes. I see my fellow trusted yelpers enjoyed their meals- but none of them eat the crepes!

Even if I never had a crepe before, let alone the AMAZING light as a cloud crepes from Paris 66 I would still know the crepes served here are largely inedible. But I am getting ahead of myself.

The place was largely empty when we arrived on a late weekend morning. Only about 3 other tables besides our party of 4. Yet we waited for over an hour for 2 orders of crepes, french toast, and a sandwich. Really? 

Our waitress was not much for conversation. My friend, who is notoriously more picky than my brother requested whipped cream instead of something else in her crepe. At first, the waitress tried to convince her not to change the menu as it would annoy the cooks. After a few minutes of talking she finally accepted my friends request. She wanted to add whipped cream not lobster I don't see what the fuss was about to begin with- bygones.

I ordered a fruit crepe. Which the exception of the cooking outcome resembling a burnt-ish flaming campfire marshmallow, folded up like an egg roll, the taste was boring, burnt, and listless. I eat two bites and put down my napkin. I had no idea one could defile a crepe in such a way until that day. 

My friend that requested the whipped cream. If I thought my crepe saw a rough afternoon her looked like it was literally dropped on the floor a few times then thrown on the plate. Guess they showed her for ordering that whipped cream? I can see now why the waitress warned us not to change the menu. May I suggest that their employees partake in some local anger management meetings?

My brother ordered the savory french toast. Italian made with ham, capicola, salami, pepperoni, and marinara Sauce. He loved it. Then again he also loves McD's and Taco Bell. I did not try his meal, I took his word for it.

My husband ordered a sandwich The Club- he said it was good. Not bad, not great but good. 

Lastly, I was not a fan of their coffee either. I could not wait to leave. I only live a few blocks away and needed to go home to make something to eat.

On a positive note, I loved the Einstein artwork. It was the one positive thing I can recall of our visit."}
{"text":"Delicious Cobb salad. Looked beautiful and tasted great.  Ingredients all fresh.   Ton of big thick  slices of bacon. Comfortable atmosphere. Reasonable prices. I will come back here again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite lunch/brunch destination.  Great discovery!  Outdoor deck was terrific.  The menu had so many great options that I had difficulty deciding what to get.  I finally ordered the chicken sandwich (not doing the actual menu name justice) with brie and a wonderful salad with home made dressing to die for came with it as the side.  Seriously, I didn't think that a chicken sandwich could taste this good.  Can't wait to go back to try the crepes!  Heads up...they are not open for dinner."}
{"text":"They have an incredible Crepes! I went this afternoon to Cafe Mona and I ordered the Tuscan Chicken crepe it coms with side salad as most of the dishes in that Cafe, and it's really delicious, the companion of the feta cheese and the artichoke with the fresh chicken is insane!! I just loved it! And I ordered Turkish Coffee couldn't believe how good they made it.The place is Super clean, cozy and they play nice music,they also have outdoor patio and a strong connection Wifi.I think Cafe Mona is my new hangout place. I live in Shadyside and it's about 20 minutes walking. I think it's worth a try. Great experience."}
{"text":"That Place is Hidden Gem!!! Outstanding Service With Delicious food with beatiful presentation. Peaceful ambiance. People who like outside seating must try this place. I Love everything about this place. This Place is a must see."}
{"text":"Awesome outside seating area, BYOB and a great selection of brunch dishes! Options for sweet and savory crepes, French toast, sandwiches and salads. Got the pesto chicken crepe and berry topped french toast with chocolate for dessert- both of which were delicious. The owners are super nice and service was awesome. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've always run past this place during my AM workout so my fiancée and I decided to try it out last weekend. It was a nice, quiet place over in Lawrenceville which has a great breakfast/brunch selection with sizable portions. If you like the Ritter's/Pamela's scene, this is a step up, both in quantity and quality."}
{"text":"I used to come here wt my friends for brunch, it's been a while since I did my last stop. They changed a lot of things here.. they have crepes, French toasts, bagels and much more.. too many delicious options... the place is cozy, European and so nice to hang out.. one of the most beautiful back patio absolutely at Caffe Mona.. must see"}
{"text":"Great food, great people, I've been going here for awhile and I love it! Food is delicious and their patio is amazing! Totally would recommend this place"}
{"text":"This spot is the place to go if you want to enjoy an ambrosial breakfast that is sure to get you hooked from the first try. 
The employees are incredibly kind and accommodating and the owners provide service that is difficult to find at cafes nowadays. 
Was I pleased? Duh. Does a baby go ga? 
Very pleasant environment. 5-stars is an understatement."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food was good, overpriced but good. Today, however, I sat down for breakfast that I was really looking forward to but was left completely unsatisfied. I ordered an omelette and it was bland. No salt or seasoning, bad texture, the side salad was very sad. The only redeeming component was the coffee. The service was poor as well. The \"server\" seemed irritated the whole time. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I thought the food we ordered was delicious. All the ingredients in the Mediterranean omelette and Terrapin crepe tasted very fresh and flavorful. However the variety of fruits in the fruit plate could be better by adding some seasonal delights such as berries, grapes, peaches or melons.
Overall the ambiance was very calm, quiet, and refreshing . Perfect for a Sunday morning breakfast! The servers were very polite, efficient and service was prompt."}
{"text":"I would not even give this one star. my experience was horrible! we went for lunch as soon as I entered the place the server  asked me \"what can I do for you?\" obviously I was not wondering in a park or lost some where. we were there to have food. This guy was rude from the beginning. it took him some time to come to our table. finally we ordered but it took more than half an hour before I went to ask how much more do we have to wait for the food. he replied rudely \"how long has it been since you ordered \". And at that point I asked him that I would need to contact the owner of the place.  apparently the guy in the kitchen was the owner. he couldn't care less either and said it would be at least 10 more minutes if not longer. Made no effort to rectify or solve the issue. After we saw this 'take it or leave it 'attitude, we just left and went some where else. if you are looking for bad service and attitude this is the place to go. With other places next door that offer good food and excellent service, this place will close again! Apparently, this place had another name before. Either a new name or management.  Good luck buddy !"}
{"text":"Good food! The owners who are also the servers are friendly and welcoming. I had the feta,mozerrala, and spinach crepe it was really good. If you are around Pittsburgh this place is a must! I visit Pittsburgh regularly and this place is always on the top of the list! The French toast is my favorite, I crave their French toast all the time! If you are a coffee taster, their coffee is one of the best in town if not in America!"}
{"text":"Hands down! New ownership brings that place a lots of positive things. Now the place is very fresh lots of atmosphere specially back patio is rainbowy \"woov\" and very attentive service. The omelets were so yummy. We had veggie and steak omelet both were excellent . We enjoyed our coffees too.
This Cafe Mona experience was totally different than others. Give them a try highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is simply delicious!

I am not too familiar with Bloomfield area, but my friend and I were out on a Sunday looking for a nice brunch spot and we stumbled upon Caffe Mona. I noticed the lights outside and it caught our attention!

The food was incredible. She had the bagel and egg sandwich (you will see how it is done when you go) and said it was absolutely delicious. I had the banana split french toast--the name should say it all! They also offer other sandwiches and breakfast items as well as a full coffee/espresso bar.

Right on Penn across from the hospital, this is a place you definitely want to check out!"}
{"text":"Good food and vibe overall. Service is terrible. Do not come here if you've got some place to be in an hour or two. 

I've been here a couple of times over the past few months and everything moves at a snail speed - from being sat, to having someone take your orders, to getting a drink, to getting food, and even to getting the bill.

However, if you're not in a rush and don't mind waiting for a bit, go here because the food is good and the outside patio is nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing . I had lunch at Caffe Mona and I had buffalo chicken crepe it was not on the menu before they changed the menu and everything and it became one of my favorites , it is something everybody should try . From preparation to presentation it was pleasing . The staff is great everything is fresh gotta love this place . I am also gonna attach a picture of a dessert they gave me as a treat . I will definetely be back . Thank you guys great business ."}
{"text":"I have gone several times for lunch and breakfast, every time the service was slow and I felt like I was bothering them. European owner could care less about customer service/or being remotely friendly.  I once walked in and was ignored for 15 minutes until I walked to the back of the restaurant and found the owner messing with his phone in the kitchen. Again, felt like I was bothering him to make me a sandwich. 

Once ordered mocha french toast, they make it completely covered in nutella, way too much nutella, it was disgusting.  Even after scraping all of it off, I still felt sick from all the sugar. You can see pictures of it in the photos section. 

One positive is that their sandwiches are very tasty and the bread is amazing."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a handful of times.  The food is usually good but the service is always slow. The past two times its taken an hour and a half to have brunch. Not sure if the hold up is in the kitchen or with the servers but this place will be losing customers quickly. The table next to us started snacking on ceral bars they brought with them after they waited over 40 minutes for their food."}
{"text":"Incredible! Can't say enough about this place.   The food presentation is beautiful.   The fruit dish was to die for.   Overall absolutely freaking fantastic.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A sleek dining room with excellent coffee. Caffe Mona is a well-executed modern coffee shop, with clean lines and a beautiful patio. If you're looking for a place to simply get a well brewed cup of coffee look no further. While you may not want to linger in the indoor dining space due to the peculiar odors wafting from the kitchen at the back of the building, the service is impeccable and this is an excellent quick-stop for coffee and a sandwich."}
{"text":"Very nice brunch.  It's not the usual French toast and omelettes.  Not too much of a rush either."}
{"text":"So I used to work at children hospital and come this place a lot, I am big fan of savory crepes and coffee here, I now work in Shadyside, and walked in today with my friends for lunch, and I see a lot of fun changes here. They have great back patio with rainbow umbrellas. I love the fun colorful umbrellas. I ordered Penn ave sandwich and cup of coffee which was so good and high quality ingredients. The server was so sweet turns out he is actually the owner and so kind. We will definitely come back. I enjoyed the art and music. Definitely a comfortable atmosphere. I left  full and happy. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Over rated. Nice venue but crepe with apples were very not very good, they didn't taste like anything. Also spanakopita was not very flavorful."}
{"text":"A great little undiscovered place that is frequented by locals and people like us that are always looking to find unusual little places to go to.... And Caffe La Mona  is certainly that! My daughter took me for birthday brunch and even though the menu is not as large as during the week, there were a lot of choices on the menu  Everything was fresh, tastefully prepared and presented. The service was great( not sure where everybody's coming from with complaints of slow or non-existent service, not this day) . For sure we will be returning there!!"}
{"text":"Nice cafe with unique outside seating. I recommend if you're looking for a casual brunch spot in the area. One thing I wasn't a big fan of is how they served water from mini Costco? water bottles, but maybe it was a temporary? thing. I ordered the Mediterranean? omelet? and it was delicious. 

The outside seating area is fun, it has a bunch of rainbow umbrellas? hanging above to block the sun. ?"}
{"text":"Feel like the food and drinks are overpriced, the food is good, but for the amount and type of ingredients feel it's too pricey. Have had inconsistent service so can't really comment on it, once it was pretty good, the other two times I've been it felt like it was a bother to them to serve and there were only two other people inside."}
{"text":"So, first things first - four stars for the food. It's great. I'm a native Pittsburgher and discovered this place on a visit this summer. They make a great quality brunch, and the mocha French toast is amazing. 

But the service would get two stars - and even that might be generous. 

Others have mentioned this, but the waitstaff at this restaurant is so profoundly unfriendly and unwelcoming that we began to wonder if we were on a hidden cam reality show. We walked in and the staff person (possibly the owner, based on comments - a middle aged man with glasses) literally stared and BLINKED at us until he finally said, \"Breakfast?\" Not, welcome....or hello...or anything like that. 

Our waitress in the summer was the same way. No words, no pleasantries, nothing. I don't need anyone to slop on fake pleasantries, but c'mon folks. A few basics, please!

Seriously, we felt as if we were imposing on them by being there. As a native, I know we Pittsburghers can be no-nonsense, blunt, and to the point, but either this place is being run by a staff comprised solely of people who are living with Asperger's, or they're just plain rude and unfriendly."}
{"text":"Stopped by Cafe Mona with a friend of mine this week and were pleasantly impressed with another new bistro.  The interior is eclectic and kind of reminds you of being on vacation somewhere else.  The outdoor seating in the rear is as pleasant as it gets.  Vibrant and colorful and quite airy.  My friend had the chicken pesto salad which looked incredibly fresh and attractively constructed.  I had the Cheese steak crepe which I wanted to try just out of curiosity.  The flavor was exact but the crepe made the dish a whole new experience.  A good part of the menu is crepes and I wast to try many more.  The staff were friendly, courteous and attentive.  But most of all...they smiled and seemed honestly glad to see you.  Quite friendly and gracious."}
{"text":"Had the Mediterranean Omelet and could eat this for breakfast everyday. It was delicious with some of the best coffee I've ever had. Great service, very cool decor. Love eating here!"}
{"text":"Wasn't sure about stopping because it's a very small restaurant from the outside, but decided to give it a try.  What a great menu!  Everyone in our party of three loved what they ordered, the iced Mocha was excellent!  We'll definitely stop again the next time we're in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to grab a quick breakfast on a Thursday morning before they left to drive back home. We had a wonderful experience at Caffe Mona. 

The coffee was a little strong but the breakfast sandwiches were out of this world. The basil pesto that they used in mine was some of the freshest I've ever had. The service was fast and easy and I am pretty sure our server was also the cook. Would recommend and will be going again soon."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes! The best breakfast! Looking forward to go back to try other foods in the menu. I loved the coffee taste. Has very rich flavor. Of course Turkish coffee is the best !!!"}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED this place ! If you want to have amazing and delicious breakfast YOU MUST visit this caffe ! Atmosphere and design is really cool ! 
Gonna come back for sure !  Service is great ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"Hands-down best brunch ever and Rod Grandma Square is amazing food was amazing and Grace really enjoyed my homework and I drink your tea's and the outside is amazing and the food is very unique and they gave us free food afterwords and there's free bottle water from Cosco and chocolates are free with the coffee"}
{"text":"Came looking for J'eet but found Caffe Mona in its place.  My girlfriend ordered the Mediterranean Scramble and enjoyed it.  I got the Surfer Dude crepe, with spinach, feta, olives, and a greens salad.  It looked more like thin crust pizza than crepe, but everything tasted fresh and delicious nonetheless.  I'm tempted to find out if they make their own salad dressing... it was so good.

Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, and the outdoor deck seating was cute.  Just a lovely brunch experience overall."}
{"text":"Just to be upfront, I only very recently went here once and I only got a cup of coffee to sit and work for a bit. I did not get any food. So I live a few blocks down from Penn and I've walked past this place dozens of times. I was really surprised to read that this place has been reviewed a bunch and seems so established. To be honest, almost every time I walk by the place is empty. And after walking in, even though it's very cool and beautiful on the inside, I got the sense that it was a newer place just starting to get its bearings. This was the case with my stop-in (around 10am on a weekday). The guy behind the counter was helpful and nice. Something that I noticed was a little odd was that he said the cook was out and I'd have to wait if I wanted to get food- so I got a cup of coffee and sat down to work for a bit. The coffee was good, and the Wifi is free and worked perfectly. After a while, the guy behind the counter gave me a menu and even a free refill on coffee while we waited for the cook the arrive. The menu actually looked really tasty, particularly the brunch food (I'm a sucker for breakfast food anytime of the day). I wasn't necessarily stopping in for food, but if I had I would have been frustrated waiting. I finally got up and paid for the coffee and left. I might come back to try the food- and hopefully the cook will be around!"}
{"text":"We went to Caffe Mona La Bistro for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was excellent. We tried the Mediterranean omelette and the Caffe Crepe. The atmosphere/ambiance, service, and quality of food were all great! The serving size was generous for the cost. Loved the homemade fig jam, too. The cappuccino was rich and tasty. I hear the French toast is the best in town. I would definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We went to this cafe for the breakfast. We like everything here. Food is delicious. Decoration is unique. Very good service. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch with a friend yesterday. We work close-by and walked less than a block to get to this sweet cafe. 
A small bottle of water is given right after we were seated. The menu has several interesting choices. 
Enjoyed the fig sandwhich, which is huge and comes with a nice fresh side salad. 
A sweet touch was when we completed enjoying the sandwhiches, a complimentary plate of mini eclairs and strawberries was delivered to our table for us. 
The decor and atmosphere are colorful and relaxed, yet give an energetic vibe that invites you to come back again."}
{"text":"I have been there many t?mes,one of the best breakfast place in the city and this place is great example of what you would want in a simple breakfast/lunch.The service was great and guys so friendly.The prices are so reasonable and I highly recommand to go and try mouthmelting omlets ."}
{"text":"Very cool place, food and latte was good. Service could be better though, maybe happier would be nice. Some of the guys acted like they just didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in town, amazing crepes and a laid back atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I checked out this hidden gem I'm Lawrenceville for Sunday brunch and I was not disappointed! I was greeted by very friendly service that was consistent throughout the meal, and the atmosphere was top notch. Inside is very quaint, and there's also a cute porch out back. Our food was equally as wonderful, and we were treated by the hostess to a wonderful eclair dessert. I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the combination of two visits.

The first was a weekday lunch:  Walked over from  Children's and the place was empty. We were seated right away and the jerk chicken crepe that I ordered arrived quick and was fairly tasty. 

The second was a weekend brunch:  The cafe was semi-full but one table and the bar seating were available. We were seated quickly and ordered soon  after -- so far so good.

Then came the wait. We waited for over 45 minutes for two orders of French toast - one savory and one sweet.  When they finally arrived, they were disappointing.  The berry topping on mine was half frozen.  My wife did not care for her spanakopita French toast.

In summary:  Not a bad choice for a quick lunch, but I recommend looking elsewhere when it comes to brunch."}
{"text":"The back patio is strongly recommended. I also think they get their coffee grounds from a different supplier, or they managed to get them fresh. Really good coffee espresso so far I have tried."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place the two times that we went.  I'm a sucker for breakfast sandwiches, and the veggie is so creative and delicious... I want one now.

The mochas are tasty, and the space is small and quiet... almost too quiet... but nice.  

I will be back to get more breakfast sammiches!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. The online menu seems amazing with so many delicious brunch options ranging from sweet to savory. Despite some of the negative reviews given to this place, I thought maybe I'll get luckier. However, my experience was a complete disaster. 

The location is great, right on a main street. The café is spacious with plenty of lighting. However, they did not make very good use of the space. The décors were all over place with Christmas, spring and summer themes going on at the same time. The service was awful as well. The server was inattentive, rude when we asked for an extra minute to look over the menu and he mixed up our order when the food came out.

The food took exactly 40 minutes to arrive to our table. There were only two occupied tables in the entire café so there should be no excuse for taking that long. I ordered the Caffe Crepe with chicken, apples, avocado and melted brie. The chicken was overcooked and super bland with no seasoning at all. There were no avocados in my crepe. The only thing I could taste was the brie. The crepe was so horrible and tasteless that I could not finish it. Each bite was a complete struggle and I had to fight to keep my food down. 

The food was bad. The service was bad. The experience was overall bad. I am ashamed for bringing my dining companions here. Caffe Mona, never again."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a long time and went there on a Sunday for brunch with my girl friend. Initially was apprehensive to go in as the look of the building was bad. When I entered the people inside were very friendly and helpful. They have fruit salad, eggs, bottom less coffee and sweet crep for just 13.99. Can't get better deal than that"}
{"text":"Nice brunch spot. This place was cozy and relaxing when we visited. It's not too crowded and not noisy. The food was good too. The only thing was we were charged for the small water bottles the waitress brought us. The prices on the menu was outdated as well."}
{"text":"Very tasty French Toast with Spanikopita! Good prices, friendly staff. Would definitely come back to try the other items in their menu. The french toast is big and I could not even finish!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars even though they have a serious service problem for Sunday brunch when the back patio is open.  The food is all fresh and excellent.  I got the banana nutella crepe and a bagel breakfast sandwich. Both were perfect and excellent.  My friend got the $20 3 course brunch with a turkey crepe, fruit cup and nutella crepe.  All were excellent, but they were all brought out at the same time which really doesn't fit the 3 course bistro marketing of this place.  

So if you come on a nice sunny Sunday for brunch, be prepared for so-so service.  We waited a long time for someone to take order and for the food to arrive.  Once it arrived, we never saw the server again.  We had to go to the front to pay and our server had to ticket for us, we had to remind him what we ordered and he figured it out.  We will be back because the food is so excellent, but maybe on a day that is not so busy."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. We were sat down, took about 30 minutes just to get our order in. When we got our food (45 minutes later) we had no utensils. The food is overpriced, I got a crepe with Nutella & bananas & it was literally just topped with it. The inside of the crepe was empty, we got a chai latte that was pretty much milk, way too much ice in my coffee that I was practically drinking water. Terrible communication. I haven't been this annoyed with a restaurant in a while"}
{"text":"After a terrible morning, these guys made my day!! Astonishingly delicious food. I ordered chicken crepe and it was well done (you gotta try!). The crew inside were awesome . It is pleasure to have a businesses like you around.
Thank you so much guys.
Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"Such a cute and quirky caffe! You don't find caffes' like this so often in Pittsburgh! It such a friendly atmosphere and the food is delicious! I got the berries French toast with vanilla cream . The servers Julia and eto were super nice and brought out complimentary cream puffs! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the owners and employees are very nice! The place is very adorable with the little umbrella sky at the patio. Adorable!"}
{"text":"Sat out back with a large group for a bachelorette party. The brunch food was excellent all around, and since it was our first time there, they gave us a free fruit platter and some pastries. My only minor complaints were that the stem cost was pretty high for the byob mimosas we brought, and while we enjoyed being outside, I don't think it should've been assumed that we wanted to be outside given that it was a chilly day. Again minor complaints, but overall a very good experience and will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"I used to drive by Caffe Mona every day while on my rotation at Children's Hospital, never realizing what a gem it is inside! I finally came here this past Sunday afternoon for brunch with some friends. We made reservations prior and we're seated right away. They have a beauuutiful patio with hanging umbrellas!!! Unfortunately due to the size of our group we were not able to be seated out there :(

They have a $20 3-course brunch special which is so worth the price! For first course you can get a salad or plate of fruit, second course you can get any entree on the menu (omelette, French toast, crepes, bagels, sandwich), and for third course you get a crepe (Nutella banana, strawberry or apricot). Also included in the deal is a latte/cappuccino, or unlimited coffee/tea.  I got the fruit plate (so much fruit!), Mediterranean omelette, and the Nutella banana crepe with a soy latte. Everything was so delicious! And the food was plentiful (they didn't skimp considering it was a 3-course). My only criticism is it took a bit of time for our food to come out, but we were a group of 7 so I will attribute some of it to that. Overall, friendly, interactive staff and good food!"}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast and this place has got it !!! Omelettes lattes gourmet French toast crepes omg so good this place is my jam !!! I love a good cafe along W a good brunch & atmosphere is adorable !!! I got a latte an awesome veggie omelette and French toast all fantastic !!!!! and can't wait to try every item on their menu !!!!!!!!!!! So many options. Yay for finding awesome new brunch places can't wait to go back !!!"}
{"text":"Really great service. Everyone was very friendly and the environment is even more comfortable than when it was J'eet....I consider myself a coffee snob, and the latte I got was pretty good. My favorite meal of any day is brunch and their menu is packed with interesting sweet AND savory french toast dishes and crepes...delish!! I may become a regular :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We waited over two hours for our food, and the server defensively said that the cafe is \"European style\" when we ultimately asked for our food to go. The thing is that in Europe servers provide excellent service consistently over a several hour period while you linger over your meal. We were just lingering over our growling stomachs, the server didn't even refill our coffees and waters. After all that, the food was merely ok."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch after my sister highly recommended it.  I wasn't disappointed!  I loved J'eet, so I was happy to see they kind of stuck with the same crepe theme, but added much more.  

The french toast is to die for - and the portion is VERY generous!  The plate of fruit is very large as well and displayed nicely.  Ours was apples, pears, bananas and oranges.  The omlette was delicious and so was the brie apple crepe.  No complaints at all!  I'm no coffee snob by any means, but I thought their coffee was top notch as well.  Everyone seemed very friendly and helpful, but not annoying -- my type of servers! 

My sister and I left very full and happy with our time there.  A huge plus is the beautiful back patio too.  I would def suggest going here when it's nice out and you can sit outside.

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We were able to bring both of our dogs. The back patio is dog friendly, but it was full so they moved a table out front by the window for us. They brought out water for the pups, and had quick and friendly service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Small coffee shop. Espresso and drip coffee. The drip coffee was very robust, like a moka pot was used. Pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Went for Sunday brunch and the food was phenomal. I especially recommend the spanikopita French toast. Not the best service but decent. The quality of the food overshadowed any subpar service. If you can, go when you can sit outside. The patio is lovely and (surprisingly) not crowded at noon."}
{"text":"The owner is an asshole. I don't expect servers to coddle me, but some amount of welcome is appreciated. I've been here numerous times because my boyfriend lives very close by. Every time I've been in, the owner seems bewildered that I would want to sit and eat breakfast. Imagine! Breakfast at a cafe that serves breakfast! When I sit down, he continues to act as if I'm imposing on him, while I eat my (honestly, average) breakfast. Really not worth it. Today, he said there \"might\" be someone in to make breakfast at 8. I went to *Einstein's* for, and had a really comparable meal served by a human being who was perfectly nice to me. I genuinely hope Mona's goes out of business."}
{"text":"Passionate, caring and hardworking owner. Focused on customers, providing a warm and friendly atmosphere. Don't hesitate, go in and try the food for yourself, you won't regret."}
{"text":"Cafe Monna is another breakfast/brunch spot in the Bloomfield corridor that flies under the radar.

Breakfast is without a doubt the most important meal out of any. This being said, the varieties in breakfast fare from culinary adventurous, to hip and chic, to greasy spoon leave a diversity in the class of breakfast and brunch themed resteraunts or events.

To me, it is like Best Picture overall, Foreign Language film of the year, or Best RomComnotstarringSethRoganOrBradleyCooper.

Caffe Monna is its own niche. They can really develop this into something fantastic with their real estate. They have a quaint inside, and sidewalk seating. The outside porch is magnificent. Kudos for outside spaces that make our flighty Pgh sunny days all the more wonderful.

CM has a hipsterish vibe, and there is nothing wrong with that. Their menu is succinct and their coffee mugs large. The prixe fix menu is very reasonable on price, as are most of their options. They could use a few more meat and taters options though, as potatoes, to me, are the hallmark of a good brunch.

I ordered the Elvis Crepe and my girlfriend ordered the French toast. My crepe was somewhat dull and had too much peanut butter. The simplicity that is a perfect crepe was betrayed by the lack of balance in the ingredients. A crepe with bacon, bananas and peanut butter can be made a lot more interesting. The PB should be a very delicate spread though.

My girlfriends french toast with fig preserve and brie was quite good. The fig preserve could have been made better as a fig syrup.

If CM steps their culinary game up just a tad, they could be a repeat spot pretty easily. I don't think this would take too much on their part."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Food and service were excellent!  We had the brunch special with the bacon/tomato/gruyere omelette, the lovely fruit plate, and banana Nutella crepe to finish. Definitely coming back and sending friends!"}
{"text":"We have been there several times with my friends,really nice place for breakfast,I love their nutellabananacrepe and french toast with berries and guys so friendly you should go and try mouthwatering crepes.... i just came back for delicious omlet today, and again and again never leaving this place unhappy .. thank you guys"}
{"text":"Great place to grab breakfast. The bagel sandwiches and omelets come with fresh greens and their fruit platter is a great deal!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure how this happened or is possible, but my crepe was served with Velveeta \"cheese\".

Moment of silence. : /

Also, I was given a smuckers grape jelly plastic container. 

Besides that the food was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"This is very nice café.

The coffee is fantastic. It's strong & has a lot of good flavor

The café crepe was good. It could have a little more flavor in it. But I would give it four out of five.

The bacon chicken sandwich was very good with the exception of the chicken being kind of dry. I would give the sandwiches three out of five and probably choose something different next time I go.

Besides all of that came with the sandwich in the crate we're good they had balsamic vinegar rat on them.

The price was a little expensive for what we got. I was also little disappointed to find out that they did not have tapwater and we got charged for half size bottles of water.

Overall the experience was pretty good the staff was friendly and attentive environment was nice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed brunch today.  Liked the french toast with berries and creme, as well as the french toast with brie, apple and fig.  Coffee is excellent.  Service was friendly (thanks, Tuba!) and the atmosphere pleasant and comfy.  Sat and chatted for an hour after we finished and didn't feel pressured at all.  great little place.

BTW, was there on a 95+ degree day and the temp inside was fine (referencing an earlier review about it being hot)"}
{"text":"I was a fan of J'eet when I wandered in last year.  I found the coffee here to be exceptional, especially when I told the owner to \"surprise me\" when he asked what I would like.  I had a spinach French Toast that was exceptional, as savory French Toast was something of a new experience and the Chili was good enough that I ordered a second portion to take with me on the long drive home.  I'm looking forward to making this a regular stop when I visit the Childrens' Hospital across the street.  I spoke at great length with the owner, who was very interested in customer feedback, as was the chef, who told me a lot about how she selected a real artisenal bakery with fresh deliveries."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars, but unfortunately Yelp forces you to give a star rating.  This place is the worst. My fiancé and I just left.  We unfortunately cannot rate the food, since we were not served any. Instead we were seated then any present waitstaff disappeared for 20 minutes. So, we left.  It was barely busy. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed brunch today at the quaint Caffe Mona. Despite being pretty busy we did not have to wait long for a table. We had excellent Caffe Lattes while we perused the extensive menu. We ordered the Protein Omelette which was delicious with Ham/Turkey/Bacon and the French Toast with Berries which was beautiful and fresh. Good service - we will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place . Wanted something different. Everything on the menu I wanted. It all looked so good. Got the Meditate Crepe. Every bite was heavenly. Also got a crepe with Nutella and banana and strawberry on top and nutella hot chocolate to drink. Everything was perfect and so delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Very clean place. Its Its beautifully decorated inside it gives you a feeling of being in Paris. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for great food or coffee, this is the place to go. With a street side window, a cozy interior, and a beautiful secluded patio out back, it's the perfect place whether you're on the go, or in the mood for a nice sit down meal.
They have a great selection of crepes, omelettes, French toast, and bagels (and everything that we saw and tried was generously portioned). We tried the monte cristo french toast  and the mocha french toast and shared the Nutella and banana crepe to finish. Everything was delicious, and fairly priced. Etto, the owner, even came by to introduce himself and chat for a while, making our experience even more enjoyable.
Overall, we had a great time and definitely plan on going back."}
{"text":"Every week I go with my family, delicious food and very good service... My favorite vegetables Omelette .....     I would recommend"}
{"text":"I went to caffe mona la bistro for a brunch and i loved it. The outside patio with colored umbrellas was a very nice setup. The food was delicious too."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast / brunch spot. They have a decently  priced 3 course prix fix menu ($14) that includes \"bottomless coffee\". My food was good; first course was a large fruit plate that included pear, apples, raspberries, banana, and black berries. 2nd course consisted of a savory crepe (mushroom and onion) was was large and tasty. Last course was a strawberry preserve crepe which was my favorite of the dishes.

My only complaints are that is was quite hot inside, and it felt a bit smoky from the close proximity to the kitchen.

Give them a shot. No wait, and a lot of food for not too much money."}
{"text":"Just finished a very disappointing brunch here. We were seated right away but then waited 5 minutes for menus and water. We had to flag down the waiter to order. We ordered 2 plain crepes for our 3 year old, a Cobb salad for me and a buffalo chicken crepe with a salad for my husband. I asked for strawberries on the side for the crepes and was happy to see avocado on the Cobb salad description. I ordered a $3 ice tea. Our food was brought in a short amount of time. The plain crepes arrived as French toast. The Cobb salad was lacking avocado and had gross turkey deli meat laid over the top. I instantly recognized it from Costco. I dug into the salad and found the avocado.... dollops of Costco guacamole. I tried to eat around it but it was smeared on all the half wilted greens. My husband's crepe was fine. The salad was just greens and vinaigrette. My daughter's erred French toast was fine but not worth the cost of the meal. My ice tea was never refilled, no one checked on our meals, and the bill was $50. What a waste."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had the berry French toast and my wife had a chicken sandwich with avacado spread and bacon. The low rating comes from slow service. A long wait to order, a long wait for our food, a long wait for our check. We sat outside on the patio, it's a very cute area."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our first taste of Caffè Mona . From the warm inviting European atmosphere, to the fabulous freash quality food & happy smiling staff. Will definitely be returning for the Crepes  (They are to die for).  Very child friendly   The Coffee deserves five-stars alone ."}
{"text":"I walked in this cafe today, and ordered ille de omelet and espresso, it was so good, melted bri cheese wt side salad and all fresh ingredients like I never had such a tasty omelet before, servers are so friendly. They have a cute patio with colourful umbrellas, I'm so glad finally I got a chance to see this, definitely coming back"}
{"text":"My group and I always are looking for a new brunch spot to love. So we looked online for brunch spots ( we LOVE Coca Cafe, Gypsy Cafe, Square Cafe ) and found this GEM. It may very well be our new favorite brunch spot. Or one of them. It's SPECTACULAR!

My we shared so much stuff around the table it was unreal. The crepes were so yummy. I had the Elvis minus the bacon, bananas and peanut butter drizzled with maple syrup. So yummy, so good. Then my main course was the potato scramble. It wasn't a scramble in any way shape or form, it was an omelet. But it was one hell of an omelet. Cheese, tomatoes, and hash browns inside the omelet. So fluffy and so awesome. My good friend ordered the espresso french toast and said it was the best french toast she ever had. Drenched in a chocolatey gooey goodness. And had the perfect amount of coffee flavor to it. And the bread inspite of the glaze was still perfectly browned in butter. 

My wife went with a savory french toast, one with pepperoni, tomato, olives. Not my scene, but she loved it so that's all that matters. She said she thought it was great. 

My ONLY complaint was home fries. They weren't that great, oven browned I think then wayyy too much paprika. Most places trash home fries so no big deal. But the amount of paprika was WOW!! But no big deal. 

Oh and I went and had the gingebread latte. Couldn't wait til' September, so I went ahead and had one. MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. Exceptional latte. Great. 

Please go. If you love brunch, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The coffee alone warrants a good review. It was so delicious, just a regular cup! My mother and I went for a lunch around 1:30, there were only two other people there so we were seated immediately. The server was nice but not overly friendly.

My mom ordered the veggie and Gouda omlette and I ordered the goat cheese and sun dried tomato omlette. They came out quickly and were hot and fresh. Mine was tasty, but it wasn't anything that deserves a raving review. The salad on the side was nice as was the rustic crunchy bread!"}
{"text":"I visited Caffe Mona during my US trip.. Especially i suggest You have a breakfast there. Delicious French crepes and tasteful coffees  by the way, very friendly and cheerful staff."}
{"text":"We had a very good brunch here. The food was fresh and the space is really cute. It was really busy, but we were able to get a table right before the main rush came. 

I had a breakfast sandwich and my friend had a chicken sandwich. Both were made fresh with fresh ingredients and were delicious. 

The service left a little to be desired. They were very busy so I'll cut them a little slack. But the server forgot my coffee and was MIA for probably 30 mins. I ended up asking another server who got it for me right away. 

I will definitely return- very cute cafe/breakfast place in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and each time I encountered no problems. It's a nice place to have your coffee and work on something or just hang out. I had the meatlover's omelet which was great. The service is OK. It took a little bit for someone to take my order, but the place has many artwork and a coffee bar open to the street that I was easily distracted."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for Breakfast. We had a reservation, but had to wait for a table to open up for us, which kind of defeats the purpose of a reservation. A group with the same amount of people was in line in front of us when we entered. They didn't have a reservation and were seated right away at an empty table. That table should have been saved for our reservation instead of given to a walk-in. 

My husband and mother ordered the mocha french toast. I had the Brentwood bagel sandwich. The French toast was drenched in chocolate. It was too much. Way too heavy. The toast was supposed to be infused with espresso, but there wasn't the slightest hint of any coffee-like flavoring. My husband said he tasted some of the toast without the chocolate coating and it was flavorless. This dish had a lot of potential to be amazingly delicious, but it fell flat.

My Brentwood sandwich wasn't nearly as big of a miss as the mocha french toast, but it still was lacking. I got the Everything bagel and the sandwhich description said it was bacon, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. The only complaint I have is that there was barely any avocado. They used mashed avocado instead of slices, and they swiped a nearly undetectable amount on the bread. It was kind of disappointing since I'm a big fan of avocado! With such a weak amount, the sandwich could have really used some mayo or something to help counter the dryness of all the other ingredients. 

Besides the food, the service was a little slow and it took quite a while for our food to come out. They only had two servers working though so I could understand that they may have been a little short staffed. 

Overall, I don't know if I'd visit again. Maybe to try the crepes, but I doubt it."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast on a weekend. We arrived when they opened. It was a brisk morning, but it was still nice to have the cool breeze blowing through...until the cook went outside to smoke right in front of the window.  Inhaling cig smoke was a huge turnoff and really irritated us.

The tea selection is modest but I was beyond thrilled to find decaf English Breakfast.  For my meal I ordered the spanikopita crepe.  I was going to go for an omelet, but thought I should try something different that I can't get just anywhere.  The crepe was filled with spinach, onion, and feta cheese. It had an amazing flavor, but the crepe was rather rubbery. I actually felt like I was eating pizza rather than a crepe.  

My friend got an omelet that she really enjoyed and she also got the Nutella dessert crepe. Again, her crepe was very tough and rubbery and there was only a small smear of Nutella on it. 

I think if they tweak their recipe for crepe batter it could have far more potential to be an amazing food option. The omelet choices are pretty great. That's what I'll stick to, should I return."}
{"text":"Had crepes on the brain, and visited Caffe. Ordered the turkey blue and a coffee. The crepe portion was huge. But just big cuts of deli turkey and ham that you'd find on a chef salad. And the dollop of jar Dijon mustard on top didn't add anything. The side of tossed greens was sad too. The food was alright but I wouldn't go out of my way again for this. Service was fast and nice."}
{"text":"As I drove by Caffe Mona looking for a parking spot, (good luck. parking is on the street only) I seriously considered turning around and canceling my brunch plans. Wow. This place is a little frightening from the outside. However, when I was able to find a spot at a nearby meter, I cautious walked in and took a huge sigh of relief. The inside is quaint but charming. A few tables inside and looks like a deck with tables outside in nice weather. Although I was drawn to Caffe Mona because of the prix fixed menu, I decided that I really wanted to try the Elvis (crepes with peanut butter, bananas & bacon) and I thought that a third course of a sweet crepes might be a little much. In addition to my Elvis, I ordered a fruit plate for an app. I was rather disappointed in the fruit plate. I understand that most fruits are not in season in late March but I was expecting a little more than just apples, bananas and white grapes. It was not pleasing to the eye. Also to note, my plate was significantly larger than my two dinning companions who ordered the fruit plate as their first course with the prix fixed menu. A few minutes later, I was presented with the glory that was the Elvis. I can still taste the sweetness of the syrup and bananas perfectly complimented by the saltiness of the crisp bacon. I sat back and enjoyed every last bite while the girls were presented with their third course, a crepe with strawbery jam. In conclusion, don't judge a book by its cover. Although Caffe Mona looks rough and tumble from the outside, the food, atmosphere and decor are well worth the fight to find parking."}
{"text":"What a beautiful experience here!!! Totally worth it!!! 
We got the brunch special was amazing
Plate with fresh fruit, the you can have any plate from the menu.. even the special dishes.... andddsss also you can have a desert!!!! I'm so happy we live close because you will here from me again. 
My son enjoyed every thing like a champ!! Thanks a lot"}
{"text":"Been looking for something new for a breakfast place and came across this Bloomfield gem. We got French toasts and they were delicious! It was really hard to pick though because everything sounded really good lol. Also, the atmosphere is really lovely, so is the staff. We will definitely be back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Just yum!   Delicious, creative, and trendy breakfast options.   The only problem is I couldn't just pick one!   I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast&lunch place hands down! Foods are always fresh, the staff is friendly and l can not believe their fast service! My favorite food is south omlette and it was amazing! They put in it steak, mushroom,onion and cheddar and they served it so fast and warm enough! l also eat one every two days bagels and french toastes! They have all tastes for a delicious lunch and breakfast. l do love their backyard, you should have your lunch there, you will see how amazing place it is! Perfect environment, delicious foods!"}
{"text":"It looked so promising. I saw the cute outdoor counter/walk up window the day before and thought I'd give it a shot. Walking in, staff seemed a bit frazzled and there was small confusion about seating. They were apologetic and I was seated.

I ordered a coffee as I looked over the menu. Another waitress came by and asked what I wanted. Mocha French toast, please. I sat and waited and watched more frazzled encounters with other patrons. I checked in on Yelp (free coffee) and was playing with my phone. A waiter comes by and asks about my check in redemption on Yelp after I've toggled away. It was a bit creepy watching what patrons are doing on their phones.

After that strange encounter and over 30 minutes later did the two slices of French toast arrived. It's covered in chocolate syrup and that was all I could taste. I move some of it off while cutting the toast. Not exactly what I was expecting, but at this point, I've waited long enough and needed to get on with the day. The first slice is fine, but then here's where it went bad. Into the second toast, I tasted the egg batter and spit it out. Thinking it might have been a bad edge, I cut another piece and more egg batter and I immediately spit it out. I'm done and worried. A waitress sees my expression. I informed her it wasn't cooked completely and another waiter comes to examine the toast. Odd, but they take it away. I'm done.

Yet another waitress comes by to check on me. I'm done, I say (Really? Why would I want more?). She comes with the check. Here's the kicker, they charged me the full amount even coffee! It wasn't edible! Raw egg batter!!

Ugh. Tired of the experience, I pointed out the coffee check in and was told it'll be taken care of. I was still charged for the French toast. That's when the waiter comes with fruit and gummy bears to apologize for the toast. No, grapes, slice of apple, kiwi, nectarine, and a couple of gummies doesn't make up for it. I'm already worried, a hodgepodge of stuff isn't what I want now.

Staff tried, but missed the mark. The French toast was covered in chocolate syrup for anyone to notice it was still batter. Avoid it. I ended up getting sick. Also, they charge 50 cents for water, without telling people. It's a mini 8 ounce bottle. So much hope for this neighborhood spot and it failed in many ways."}
{"text":"Nice chilled place. Great attentive service and food (I came for breakfast, got the bagel) hit the spot. Nothing else needs to be said"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday with my friend and we got seated immediately which was awesome. This place is super cute and their menu had so many different options. Of course we went with a sweet crepe option and coffee which was amazing. The restaurant is nice because there's people around you but you can still have a conversation and hear each other too. This for sure is one of my favorite brunch spots in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I drove into Lawrenceville on New Years Eve and my Yelp popped up to tell me what good brunch places were in the area. Café Mona La Bistro was at the top of the list and I saw a pic of the outdoor seating which I thought was cool because I'm always looking for places with outdoor seating in the summer. I checked out the menu and it seemed like a great place. It seemed to have a bit of healthy and comfort foods on the menu. 

I walked in and it looked like a nice little place. I grabbed a menu and sat down. A minute later the guy at the counter greeted me and got me a coffee and a mini bottle of water. I ordered the protein omelette which had Black Forest turkey, ham, and bacon with Swiss cheese. I asked for Gouda instead of Swiss and asked if they had sides to order. The guy didn't seem to understand me so I asked if they had breakfast potatoes. He said, \"Yes we have potatoes, do you want some?\" I said yes. Waited about 15 minutes and they came to my table with my omelette and a plate of French fries with a Cajun or Old Bay seasoning on top. I said I wanted potatoes not fries but was told that was the only type of potatoes they had. No big deal, but I know not to order potatoes next time unless I want fries. 

I went to eat my omelette and noticed the omelette had Swiss cheese on it. I hate Swiss cheese but understand this is how it is on the menu so I know mistakes happen. They offered to remake it but I was in a hurry so I said I'll just eat it. The omelette was delicious. Would've been better with Gouda or the fresh mozzarella but even with Swiss it was good. Fries were baked instead of fried and they were good too. Only reason I gave  this place 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the fries and Swiss cheese. They charged me 1/2 price for the mistake since I didn't want them to remake it. 


I'll definitely come back again. One of the best breakfast places in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for making me aware of this one! I never would have imagined such a place existed! And it's not obvious by looking at the place that such wonderful food resides inside that door. We intended to try Coca Cafe for brunch but the line was far too long so we decided, based on Yelp reviews, to go up the hill and try Caffe Mona since it was so close. WOW. Amazing. The place is small but it has a deck out back that, in good sunny weather, offers a great place to sit, relax, and enjoy some good food.

Great menu selections include a prix fix 3 course brunch for $13.99 - includes unlimited coffee, a fresh fruit plate (tons of fruit!), and entree, and a dessert crepe. That's what we chose but I don't think we could have gone wrong with anything on that menu. I got the Mediterranean omelet which was done to perfection with peppers, olives and feta cheese. My wife got the savory French toast with brie, fig preserves, and slices of granny smith apples on a thick piece of French toast. She claims this may have been the best breakfast dish she's ever had. I tried it (imagine that!) and concur - it truly was amazing. People next to us got the berry stuffed French toast which, I admit, I drooled over. Even with a full stomach I would have taken a bite if they had offered. He couldn't finish his and took half home.

The crepe was the only disappointment - it tasted like it had been made ahead of time and was a little hard. I know crepes and they should be thin, served warm, and not crunchy in the least. I'm willing to forgive it since by the time that was served, I could barely eat another bite. All in all it was a great place. GREAT place. I'm ready to go back."}
{"text":"I came here for the french toast, but it was the \"cherry\" egg white omelet that I devoured. The omelet and coffee are fantastic, the french toast, not so much! I ordered the berry french toast topped with goat cheese and whatever the berry sauce that was concocted to top the french toast was awful to me, it tasted like artificial science. Additionally, I don't like french toast that's topped with fried egg, I prefer dipped in batter french toast. The waitress was very pleasant and dutiful. Before I conclude, allow me to share an oddity, the waitress unprompted brought us two small bottled waters, and to our surprise, a cost for the same appeared on the bill. I would return because I love small businesses, and the coffee and omelet were great!"}
{"text":"Really cool breakfast and lunch spot. I noticed a bunch of people ordering the authentic Turkish coffee so I can't wait to try that next time I visit. I ordered a sweet crepe and a chai latte which were both wonderful. They have limited outdoor seating but it's worth it to wait to sit on their balcony. The price is very fair and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent crepes French toast and coffee
Great service from Eto and Conner
Nice lunch patio
Would highly recommend"}
{"text":"This little cafe is perfect for a quick brunch! We ordered the berries toast with vanilla cream, the apple & brie crepe, a caprese bagel sandwich and chai lattes. I would not order the french toast again, just because it was a little too sweet for me. The chai lattes were served in a little mason jars, and they were good but could have been hotter. Everything else was delicious, especially the bagel sandwich. The staff was very kind and the food came out quickly. I will definitely go back to try more food from their extensive menu!"}
{"text":"Brunched here with the hubby & his newlywed friends on a Sunday afternoon. Sat on patio, loved the vibe, very laid back. Food was lovely, hubby and I had the prix fix -AMAZINGLY fresh and delicious! Anytime brie gets on French toast, I'm happy!Left full and happy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here nearly every Saturday for breakfast, and we are never disappointed. We bring our books, get bottomless cups of coffee, and enjoy a lovely lazy Saturday. Our favorite menu options are the pierogie crepe (it sounds scary but it is scrumptious!), the brie and apple crepe, and the berries and cream french toast. You can't go wrong with anything, but the crepes and french toast are extraordinary. Don't waste your time with bagels or eggs--why not enjoy what Caffe Mona does best? Our only complaint is that they stop serving soup once it starts warming up, but we wish they served it all year because the tomato basil bisque is delicious!"}
{"text":"Generous portions and friendly service. Check out the beautiful back patio when it's sunny outside. Convenient to Children's Hospital"}
{"text":"So breakfast was delicious!

 BUT service was slow...horribly slow. With 3 tables total I don't really think it should take 10 minutes to get a glass of water or a pot of tea. Let alone the length of time we waited for our food. 

Maybe our server was distracted by other things but eh...I rather just order food to go and call it a day."}
{"text":"So meh... that is all I can say.  For some reason, I had fond memories of the old J'eet and even though some items seem to remain the same, I am less than impressed with what they have here and the service that now goes along with it.  

I was always happy with my experiences prior to the change, but since that, everything has seemed to have gone down hill.  Take out orders seem to take way longer now (even when u call a few hours in advance), they have been \"out\" of basic items making me change my order on multiple occasions, and their coffee drinks were less than impressive.  

Not worth the $ being spent here... I think for what you get the costs are too high as well."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good! Got shot down from Coco Cafe...2 hr wait so this was plan B. It was busy and only one waitress yet service was still excellent. I had the Mona Style eggs with hot tea and it was delicious. Convenient location and inexpensive. Parking is only on street though and if it's not Sunday, it's not free."}
{"text":"Small, cozy storefront with some of the best breakfast entrées I've ever enjoyed. I had an omelette with goat cheese, spinach, and sun-dried tomatoes; perfect proportions, lovely side salad included. My wife's French Toast with fig jam and apples was exquisite - not too sweet at all. Great coffee, too."}
{"text":"I love this cafe close to Children's Hospital. Coffee is always delicious and their food is amazing. Thick slice of toasted Tuscan bread served with eggs or salad. Amazing crepes, omelettes, salads. The back patio is a little slice of paradise. Quiet and peaceful. A gem hiding in Lawrenceville on Penn Ave."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Caffe Mona La Bistro! I discovered it via Yelp last year and anytime I go out to brunch I always come back to Caffe Mona. You can tell they really pride themselves in their food and service. A few times I've stopped by on my way home from a bike ride and they're cool with me bringing my bike in and parking it by the table. They've even offered to let me store my bike in their back garage, too!

The food is also very yummy. Good hot and iced coffees. I love their omelettes, crepes and lunch foods too (sandwich with salads). 

The ambiance is great. Even when it's busy they help accommodate their guests and ensure a great experience!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to try this place but sadly I was very disappointed. The service is nice and friendly but the quality of food unfortunately is very low.  Lots of canned processed food and not fresh vegetables.  I was not even able to eat my food because it tasted like leftover food. Other people in our party were somewhat more satisfied so I might have picked the worst options on the menu but overall very underwhelming quality of food"}
{"text":"This is a hard one. On the one hand the food is always good. On the other, you must weigh which is more valuable...your time or your taste buds. This place takes forever. I mean FOREVER! Breakfast for 2 takes at least 1 hr from start to finish. If you're gonna get lunch you might as well take a personal day. I appreciate a high quality culinary experience as much as the next guy, but there's no excuse for a 45 minute omelette. Oh yea, and the coffee is haggard."}
{"text":"Really delicious food with imaginative breakfast creations (I had the Caprese bagel sandwich and it was terrific) and well-made espresso a nice atmosphere. At this to your list of breakfast places to try in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I recently brunched here with Yelp's own delightful and insightful Angela B.  We arrived around noon and were seated right away. Caffe Mona has a very welcoming décor, with tiny tables, light wood tones, and a beautiful exposed brick wall. The layout itself is very cozy, and delicious smells overwhelmed me as our friendly server handed us our menus. We both decided to go for the prix fixe brunch selection, which included soup, salad or a fruit plate to start. We both chose the fruit which was a decent selection of sliced apples, pears and bananas. Nothing super special, but perfect for nibbling while waiting for our second course. I ordered the fig and apple French toast, which was supposed to be served with fig jam, Brie cheese and Granny Smith apples. I was told by our server that they were all out of fig jam, and my heart sunk a little. He offered a substitute of apricot jam, which I accepted, although it didn't sound nearly as amazing. It was a yummy dish, the Brie was melty, creamy and gooey, the apples (even though I had just had some with my fruit plate) were a tart and crisp contrast to the sweetness of the apricot jam. I ate every bite with content. The third course consisted of a crepe with either strawberry or apricot preserves. I got strawberry, as I had already sampled the apricot. The crepe was a little crisper than I would expect a traditional crepe to be. Stiff, almost. The strawberry preserves were nice, however, and by this point I was full anyway. All in all, a pleasant meal and would certainly go back to try other menu items. 
So why only 3 stars? The music was simply awful! It was unnecessarily loud, it was difficult to hear my dining companion because we were seated underneath a speaker. The loudness might not have been such an issue if they had played something that didn't make me cringe. It was like some created a Dave Matthews Band Pandora station and just kept hitting \"like\". Well, we didn't enjoy the onslaught of Mumford & Sons, Jack Johnson and DMB that polluted our lovely brunch. I'd be happy to make Caffe Mona some more appropriate playlists...trust me, they need the help. This is very important for an enjoyable dining experience!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place for the cute little cafe atmosphere! The back patio is adorable and makes me feel European in Pittsburgh's Little Italy. I've only even been for breakfast but everything I've gotten has been great. I'm a huge fan of the bagel sandwiches--not your average breakfast sammie! The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are so delicious. My favorite is the veggie sandwich, with balsamic and creamy cheese (on an everything bagel!) They also come with a tasty little side salad. Coffee is a great and the refills are plentiful! One drawback is that they're not open very late (close at 3pm or 4pm). The service for me has also been hit or miss, which can hinder the experience but overall I think it's a great hidden gem right on Penn Ave."}
{"text":"Wonderful variations on deli fare. I've loved everything I've eaten there. My favorite is probably the Turkey Fig Sandwich, a tasty and unique dish I haven't seen anywhere else. Highly recommended. I hope more people come in!"}
{"text":"Cute place and decent food, but poor service. When I asked for tap water, they told me that they stopped using tap water because of a bacteria in the water the previous month (how do they wash the dishes?). They brought me a very small 8 oz bottle of water. I said I would need another bottle of water, and the waiter said ok. 20 minutes later the water hadn't arrived, so I got up and asked for it (I was the only person in the restaurant). Then they charged me for the bottled waters. When I mentioned it was strange that they were charging for water given that they didn't have the tap water option that I asked for, they said sorry but I'd still need to pay. Strange and not good first experience, which is too bad because they have a beautiful back deck."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love crêpes and wanted to try out a new restaurant for brunch. We both regretted it right after we ordered. The waiter was extremely slow. We waited 25 minutes just for our cappuccinos. Finally, a warm wilted salad arrived for me and \"fruit plate\" with a whole nectarine, a whole un peeled orange, and a stem full of grapes arrived for my boyfriend. Then we were served a tasteless crepe with overcooked chicken in it and a plain crepe with a few slices of banana and Nutella drizzled on it. The whole horrible experience took almost two hours. Absolutely will never come back!!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for breakfast during our weekend in town for a wedding. Delicious crepes and bottomless coffee, great value for fresh ingredients and great service. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Though the ambiance is nice, we were throughly unimpressed with the food and service. I ordered eggs, they were completely cooked through and rubbery. Came with 2 slices of American cheese (yuck)! The other food was okay, but not worth the $40 check for 2. They also charged .50 for tiny water bottles that we had not ordered. Not satisfied, not coming back. Left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Good breakfast/brunch spot. Had a veggie and egg breakfast bagel. Veggies were cooked to perfection and stayed nicely on the sandwich as you took a bite because the cheese was perfectly melted. My dining companion had one of the omelettes on the menu and deemed it very tasty. I liked that the items came with a side of greens dressed in a tangy dressing. The coffee was also to my liking, though I like a bitter cup of black coffee so take that with a grain of salt!

Overall atmosphere of the bistro was cozy and welcoming, would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place we had brunch at with our CM Rachel C and her friend the other weekend. I liked the fruit plate also. Service was a little off. The crepe with apricot jelly was very good I recall."}
{"text":"Wow. From the coffee to the Green Apple , Brie and Fig Challah French toast and the meat filled omelet my wife got everything was fresh and fantastic"}
{"text":"Super cool place. Very artsy and clean. I would highly recommend Mr Green. Coffee is delicious too and I'm a coffee snob!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We found Caffe Mona on Google and their top rating brought us across town for the best breakfast in Pittsburgh!  Completely awesome. Here is what we three had: Portabello Mushroom crepe with extra (and generous) spinach, South Omelette, Fig and Brie French Toast. Coffee was great. (We are still debating whose choice was best.) Service was outstanding - very attentive and kind. Hint: Check out the back patio with fanciful umbrellas to provide a bit of shade as you eat outside."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a great menu and wonderful service. Went there for a bridal shower after they closed. They were very attentive, and incredibly nice. They had fruit platters and water ready, and everyone ordered their own dish. They brought all dishes over at the same time and it was all delicious. Don't skip out on trying the crepes, sweet or savory, they are who they excellent. Plus, the place is beautiful. Outside, they have multiple colorful umbrellas as a roof. Great photo opportunity!"}
{"text":"The food was good; I likely won't be back.

I was planning to get a crepe but I saw the spanikopita french toast and knew I had to try it. It was really tasty, and a wonderful combination of flavors. 

Honestly, this may seem like a small grievance but I'm really put off by this: they automatically charge for bottles of water that you don't order. Sure, they're only .50, but I don't buy bottled water and made sure not to drink the teeny tiny bottle that was brought out (before I even arrived while my friend was waiting, no less). It didn't matter, it was on the bill anyway. 

The server brought our check out, and I showed him my coupon for a free coffee upon check in on Yelp. We then gave our cards, but he didn't update the original bill or itemize it per person when he returned; just ran our cards. I think he split it 3 ways evenly instead of by item ordered because my bill was only a few cents cheaper than the others. So, I'm not certain that he took my coffee off my bill or not. Ordinarily, I would give him the benefit of the doubt, but given that they trick each customer into purchasing water that isn't ordered, I'm side-eyeing this place a lot harder than I would normally."}
{"text":"This was an amazing find. We always eat around this area and have never heard of it oddly until yesterday. I don't know how it snuck up on us! My girlfriend and I were extremely impressed with their food, prices, portions, decor, and overall atmosphere. Yesterday, we bought the mocha French toast, the Nutella crepe, and a cappuccino. The French toast came with a shot on the side you could pour on the toast which was delicious, the crepe was huge and was full of flavor, and the cappuccino was delicious in the mason jar! Our server was great as well! Our favorite part was the patio. They have rainbow umbrellas hung up all over the place with other cute decor all around! They also gave all the tables a free plate of cream puffs which were to die for! I was so happy I saw this place advertised on yelp, otherwise I don't know if I would have ever found it!! I would highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"5 STAR WITH NO DOUBT!!!! So i just started workin at children hospital, and was lookin for a nice place/good food to eat, i asked people there and they told me to go Caffe Mona, just a cross from where i work, its like a min walk. And i walked in this amazing cafe shop. I loved it. The wall decor, outside seating under rainbow umbrellas and everything is just excellent. I so ordered Portobello crepe, and home made iced tea. Crepe was so good, melted swiss cheese and onion with portobello mushrooms.. yummmm.. its just mouthwatering.. im so glad i found this place, very European, cozy and hipstery cafe shop. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"Favorite brunch place that I've dined at since I moved to lawrenceville, kind of slow service though. Breakfast sandwich was larger than average, which was a nice surprise. Free coffee or tea when you check in too!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in lawrenceville. The food was fantastic and the service was exceptional.  BYOB is a plus. The staff were very friendly. Loved the outdoor patio.  The owner ETO stopped and made conversation with us. The cappuccino was fantastic. I would go again and again."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in Pittsburgh! Food is absolutely delicious and so reasonably priced. The best part is that there is never a wait (at least no time that I have been here!) and service is typically very quick. A must try in the spring/summer too with the peaceful patio in the back."}
{"text":"amazing patio!! under colorful umbrellas!! delicious food, great coffe, friendly service! nothing to say more !! everybody should try there !! i will back definitely!"}
{"text":"The Num Num was WOW, the Fig and Turkey sandwich was HUGE and delicious, the Egg and Cheese Bagels were standard but delicious, and the  Apple and Brie Crepe was good (but not great). Overall, the food came in huge portions, and tasted amazing on a Saturday morning at 11am when accompanied by some coffee and sunshine."}
{"text":"a hidden gem! everything was spot on: the sun dried tomato omelette, the crepes, the americano... and don't forget the service. everyone was so nice and helpful"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this little coffee shop ... It's cozy and the service is prompt ... Had the Nutella crepé with bananas which was very good and also had a cup of coffee !!"}
{"text":"First of all, I want to say if you close the Bloomfield you should be try sandwich and crep. Also omelette..These guys very friendly and hospitality.."}
{"text":"We had intended to visit J'eet today and found that it was gone, and Caffe Mona in its place. We had also walked just as the restaurant was supposed to closed but we didn't realize, and yet the owner served us graciously.

The menu has some of the same offerings as J'eet did, with many new additions as well. Notably, the espresso machine and coffees have returned. Mike had the Elvis crepe (banana, peanut butter, and BACON!), I had one with spiced applesauce, caramel, and walnuts. The crepes themselves were excellent, just the right texture and the flavor spot on. I love the new crepe offerings, can't wait to try them, plus there is a French toast menu which is a great idea.

We chatted with the new owner for a bit, he's a really interesting and friendly guy and he makes good food for sure, so we'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"I loved this placed! THe vibe is amazing! If you can try to sit on the deck with instagram friendly umbrella decor. I've been here a couple times so I've tried a couple things on the menu. They even made me a smoothie that wasn't on the menu. All in all a nice place to grab a quick bite with cute decor and great service."}
{"text":"The chocolate covered strawberry crepe did not have fresh strawberries, it had preserves. I wish their menu had said that it is strawberry preserve."}
{"text":"So we wanted to get brunch and my friend thought that this would be a good idea. 

The service sucked so horrible that it made us lose our appetite.  The waiter asked us if we were ready to order (we weren't) and sighed. We had just gotten seated and already we were feeling unwanted.  Once we ordered we waited for what seemed like ages, it was actually 40 minutes, and he never came over to tell us where our food was, if we wanted more water, to apologize for the wait, anything.  The people who came after us (smaller party) got their food before us.  

My friends and I  were furious, we were going to just get up and leave and then he finally brought our food (no explanation either). We didn't even order anything particularly extravagant.  My friends both ordered savory crepes and I ordered the White Salad.  It was good, but way too much chicken.  My friends both said that the food was so creamy and rich that it made them sick.  

TLDR: I would never go back, not even for big portions."}
{"text":"Such amiable and attentive owners, they gave us great service. The food is awesome as well. Definitely will come back :)"}
{"text":"This is probably one my favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh lately.. I've been coming here since I moved this city for school, the place is pretty trending, decorated and smells like Europe.. today we came for Saturday brunch with group of 6, it was really busy, but we had seat right after we walked in.. servers and management is just working great here.. u can't complain, maybe because of thanksgiving weekend it was very busy. We ordered omlets, crepes, and some breakfast sandwiches. Ingredients are so fresh and tasty. I got apple bri crepe, melted bri cheese diced apple and walnuts with honey. It's definitely mouthwatering crepe u should give a try. Well before I go, I like to say best coffee ever u can ever taste here at Caffe Mona. You guys rocks !"}
{"text":"Wonderful little hole in the wall brunch place.  Both times I came it was a Sunday around noon and I was really surprised that it wasn't more crowded since this place is so awesome.  Delicious food and coffee, reasonable prices, and great service in a cute and cozy atmosphere.  They also have a great outdoor patio for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I've walked past his place several times, so I had to finally check it out.  Boy, I'm glad I did.  Caffe Mona is great.  The service was good, and the staff was really friendly.  i ordered the Remember the Alamo savory and crepe and my bf got a breakfast sandwich. Both were delicious. My only complaint would be I wish I would have had a bit more dressing on my salad. I'm not someone who likes their salads drenched, but I would like to have the dressing noticeable. Coffee was good and strong.  i will definitely be heading back here.  The menu is interesting and I'm ready to try more."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and loved the Ille omelet. Friendly staff and I appreciate that the brunch dishes come with a side salad and are price 10 or less. My brie and spinach omelet topped with julienned green apple was a great combination and the whole thing (minus the toast) was really friendly to my low carb diet."}
{"text":"First of all, the staff at Caffe Mona are so lovely and personable!  They are so accommodating and friendly!

The food was absolutely fantastic - there is a great variety to order from! I decided on the Elvis, a sweet crepe with my favorite food groups: peanut butter and bacon!!!   Most importantly, the coffee is so flavorful, I didn't even need cream or sugar! Coffee is a necessity in my life, and it definitely complimented my sweet meal.

The outside deck pays a sweet homage to the \"umbrellas\" of the three rivers arts festival by their own exhibit of multi-colored hanging umbrellas. It was perfect for the sunny day- just enough colorful coverage!

Caffe Mona does not disappoint- I can't wait to return soon!  Next time I hope to try a savory crepe - the buffalo chicken crepe looked delicious."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect. 
Coffee and food were amazing. 
Atmosphere was relaxed and felt like home. 
Server was friendly and helpful.
Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this cafe. The atmosphere is very cozy and very French. Loved all the details in regards to decor. 

I ordered the Mediterranean omelet it was delicious. I also ordered their chai tea latte which was great as well. I recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"A good place for a casual brunch with a large group. We were able to make reservations for 9 the same morning without a hitch. The brunch special is a great deal - you get to try multiple items for much less than their combined price. The menu is really extensive, with a ton of different types of crepes, sandwiches, French toast, omelettes and more. The food was pretty good; I appreciated the fresh, seasonal fruit on the fruit platter that came with the brunch menu (as an option), and my apple and Brie-filled omelette was tasty. Coffee was also good. Someone had their small dog on a leash; they seem dog-friendly. Nothing blew me away, but it was all good enough for the price!"}
{"text":"I love this place, especially for breakfast! 

The staff is lovely and the food is delicious. We loved the patio. The umbrellas are neat. It's like you're not even in Pittsburgh. 

I highly recommend this hidden gem! 

Oh . . . and if you're nice, they might make you Turkish coffee, upon request! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in before hitting the strip district for some Saturday shopping. The atmosphere is casual and cozy, we were invited to seat ourselves wherever we liked. 

We quickly perused the menu and decided on cappuccinos to start with. The cappuccinos are very sizable and pretty good quality. I mentioned to our server that we were thinking about Turkish coffee, but he told me that was typically reserved for after the meal. 

I decided on the veggie omelet and my boyfriend got the Mona sandwich. Both were fabulous, but the Mona sandwich was definitely the winner... try it! We also split a Nutella and banana crepe, which should not be missed. 

After we finished up, the waiter remembered we were interested in Turkish coffee, and asked if we would still like some but unfortunately we were way too full. Will definitely be back to try it out though!

The only reason I am rating Caffe Mona a 4 is because of the bathroom cleanliness. Wish it was a bit more well maintained."}
{"text":"Very good experience. Service was good (which seems hard to come by these days). Server was new, but still took care of us. Atmosphere was good. A unique breakfast menu. My friend and I split the Brentwood bagel & Brie & Apple Crepes - both meals were delicious! I got a latte and she got a coffee. Constantly came around to fill coffee & waters. Good prices for the quality of food. We went on a Saturday morning, but luckily had no issues finding the place or finding parking. Steps from Children's Hospital. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something a little unique."}
{"text":"First time visit with friends. Great value for $20 brunch specials! Delicious food and casual cozy atmosphere added up to a good time with friends. Highly recommended. Next time we will try seating at the back patio in warm weather."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this brunch location. The iced coffee is delicious! I drink endless amounts of it when I'm there. 
The staff and owners are always friendly. 
I got the chicken pesto salad, and it was amazing. Would highly recommend, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"For Sunday brunch you can't beat it! Delicious food, recommend French toast w/ berries. Crepe with Nutella and banana is wonderful. We will be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is very over rated. My omelet wasn't cooked well, the eggs weren't even beaten the whole way. It came with smoked gouda and it was just two thick slices I side of the omelette... the cheese wasn't even warm... like, they cooked the omelette, then added the cheese. I was holding my coffee and when I went to let it go, it stuck to my hand because of how dirty the cup was. They also make you pay for tiny water bottles... I like to drink a lot of water, and had I known that is have to pay for it, i would have brought my own. The waiter offered me a new coffee but I declined because I just wanted to leave. He went to grab the check and came back with dessert, which was thoughtful and delicious... but that was the only part of my breakfast that I even enjoyed. I doubt I'll come back here. I had much higher hopes based on the many photos and rave reviews."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite place for a bagel! I got the Brentwood and it was amazing and so fresh!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch or breakfast! Mediterranean omelette was really good and accompanied by salad. Stuff is very friendly, attentive and quick! Atmosphere is calm and easy going. All in all a very nice place for a relaxing weekend morning. Recommended, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Not enough stars to rate this place !!!! Great food, serve and atmosphere. I had the Protein 9 omelette and a Chia Tea Latte. Absolutely delicious. You have to check them out. You wont regret it"}
{"text":"Lovely place for brunch! The outdoor patio is very quiet and peaceful. The Elvis crepe, the Brentwood bagel sandwich, and the coffee drinks are all quite delicious. I have been twice, both were very pleasant experiences. Only complaint (if you could call it that) is that food can be a bit slow to arrive if the place is busy. Service is extremely friendly however, so they were attentive throughout the meal. One of my favorite quaint brunch spots in the city!"}
{"text":"I stopped in one day before work for some coffee because I've always seen it when I get off from work. Their coffee menu is not extensive so I ordered an iced mocha. I asked if they made cold drinks and they said they did. What was offered to me was disappointing. My cold drink was delivered in a double layered paper cup and there was too much ice in my drink so it became diluted too quickly. I will not be going back for the coffee."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to return for the awesome Caffe Mona brunch for a while - in fact I can't believe it's been so long since we've been here. After reading some less than stellar reviews I felt compelled to jump in and send Caffe Mona some love!

This place is incredibly cute - very European inspired, brick walls, wooden tables & an awesome back patio. Reminds me very much of Birchwood Kitchen in Chicago, which I love! Plus they have a killer location literally right across the street from Children's Hospital. 

The $13.99 prix fixe brunch menu was an exciting thing to find. The only thing that could have made it better would have been knowing it was BYOB before we went. Nothing better with a tasty brunch than a good bottle of champagne, although their coffee was pretty darned delicious.

I started off brunch with a fresh fruit plate and everything served was in season, ripe & juicy. Great start. Then I was served a dish that made my eyes roll back in my head (even without the champs)! The savory French toast topped with house made fig jam, Brie that was super creamy & buttery and Granny Smith Apples was absolutely superb. The flavor combinations complemented each other perfectly and I only shared a couple of bites with hubby & devoured the rest. 

I was totally stuffed when the final item, an apricot jam crepe, was placed in front of me. Sad to say, they should have skipped this item. It was crunchy & pretty flavorless. I couldn't have eaten it anyway, but based on the rest of the meal it just didn't compare. 

Next visit, I'll have a hard time not ordering that French Toast again & you can bet there will be champagne!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! Everything on the menu I've tried so far has been delicious. The coffee is good too. The folks that work here are really nice. 

My only issue is that the coffee cups are far too small."}
{"text":"I came today this caffe with my best friend for some good coffee and lunch, i had berries french toast with vanilla on top, it came with powder sugar and whipped cream, ingredients are so fresh and plate looked so good, my friend had holy crepe which is cream cheese and nutella melted in crepe top walnuts and caramel.. it was so good too, we both got latte, served wt cute mason jars. Place was pretty busy, servers are so kind and did a good job. We will def be back!"}
{"text":"A modern crepery with unique and cultural food styles. The best place to grab breakfast! When I went my friend and I got fast service with lots of options for food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch place in Pittsburgh :) The place is so cozy, the food is always fresh, the staff are super friendly.

Last time I got Nutella Banana Crepe, Vanilla Latte and Turkish coffee. The presentation on everything was so pretty! My crepe came up like bouquet of flowers, latte was topped with heart shaped foam and Turkish coffee was served in tiny cute cup! Everything was served hot and I really enjoyed my brunch! 

So this is definitely nice place to have breakfast and brunch!"}
{"text":"My review is based on the overall experience of the place. My friend and I went on a Sunday a little after noon. It was not very crowded inside, but the patio was full. We ended up sitting at a high top table, which was fine. It took them awhile to tell us whether or not they had outside seating available. So that was weird. 

I ordered the potato Mona styles eggs. The eggs came with a small piece of toasted bread and a tiny salad. The salad dressing was delicious (balsamic) and the lettuce and tomatoes were incredibly fresh. I would have been ok sacrificing some eggs for more salad. The eggs were also really interesting and tasty. There was a little bit too much cheese on the eggs but I still thought it was yummy. I loved the bread and wish it had been larger!

The experience was overall not pleasant, though. They seemed short staffed. The guy at the front seemed incredibly stressed and frazzled. I think there was a family there that really frazzled the staff. They kept going behind the counter and preparing their own drinks! It was really weird. So I understand that the annoying family was not the staff's fault, but their annoyance was translating onto other customers like us. The guy was clearly not handling it well and it showed. Again, this was really not their fault because that family was so obnoxious!

I would maybe go again if I had a patio seat. I feel like all that frenzied activity would have been shielded from us had we been outside. So, while the food was excellent, the service was very uncomfortable.

I would say it was just a bad day! So that's why I'll still give four stars. I docked a star for the staff experience."}
{"text":"Sit out on the patio! Lovely ambiance inside and out, but the floating umbrellas on the patio are sweet. 
Good coffee, a varied menu, hard to choose. I had the French toast with Brie, apple and fig compote which was a mix of savory and sweet. 
The Nutella hot chocolate was fabulous, but too rich to drink a whole mug!"}
{"text":"I loved my breakfast, our waitress was very friendly and helpful with menu selections. It also has a great atmosphere and good tea. Highly recommended for people looking for all day breakfast or a good cup of coffee. Will be returning soon. Prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"I cant imagine another place to sit and drink my coffee better than Mona La Bistro in the neighborhood ! Amazing design, cool staff and beautiful taste. Always fresh and on time! I always enjoy this place. Love!!!"}
{"text":"At last, Kay and I made a lunch date with our saint of a Community Manager Rachel and a non-Yelping friend of hers. Rachel suggested Caffe Mona for a brunchy kinda get-together, and due to the establishment's hours, it made for a perfect Sunday afternoon fit. 

As I write this, my dilemma is whether or not to give Caffe Mona a 3 or a 4.

First off, the service, while friendly, was somewhat flighty. Our server brought us a dish that none of us had ordered, and at the end of our meal, mixed up our split checks. 

Secondly, the food seemed to be just a scintilla astray. 

Acting as a starter was a tastefully simple plate of freshly cut fruit. Granny Smith Apples, pears, and watermelon triangles did wonders for my produce cravings of late. The watermelon in particular was gushingly ice-cold and made for ideal, wholesome snack. 

My minor issues with the food began with my breakfast entree. The Potato Scramble, a dineresque \"garbage-style\" jumble of cubed tubers, Applewood bacon strips, Roma tomatoes, and Swiss cheese filled my stomach but failed to excite me much. An online search indicates a bit of controversy over whether or not to season scrambled eggs, but in this case, I felt a pinch of salt and a crank of the pepper mill would have lifted this dish from mildly palatable to positively epicurean. The textural admix of light/fluffy/crispy/chunky/creamy/gooey was bold while the flavors were a little shy. 

Desiring a dessert of some kind, I also had an Oreo Crepe, which was supposed to contain within an \"Oreo-infused\" blanket both Oreo fragments and marshmallow. The crepe itself somewhat resembled a gourmet Pop-Tart in appearance, toasty taste, and mouthfeel and didn't seem to have any Oreo origins to speak of. The filling did have an Oreo gravel inside it but seemingly lacked the marshmallow, making the crepe far more timid than the decadent mess of a treat I expected. I did enjoy it but not as much as I thought I would. 

So, perhaps a 3 is appropriate after all. Mona's got the looks with her modern, brick-and-wood-laden decor and welcome-to-my-new-loft ambience but could use some fine-tuning in terms of service and culinary technique. 

P.S. All of us had a pleasant, chatty time together despite the uneven dining experience."}
{"text":"Such a great spot for brunch! Highly recommend the super divine Mocha French Toast (ask for some bananas on top). It's literally dipped in chocolate! The crepes, bagel sandwiches, and omelettes are also awesome. Also, one of the best cappuccinos I've had in Pittsburgh! Such nice staff and owners - truly a can't miss spot!"}
{"text":"Im visitin pittsburgh all the way from europe, my favorite kinda food is crepe, and i was wondering if i can find a good place to have some in the united states, couple of my friends told me to go to Caffé Mona and try it. so i went there today for the first time. It is so european, cozy, such a lovely place, they have too many good options on the menu and its not that pricey at all. I had a mr green crepe its asiago mozarella feta with some fresh baby spinach in it. That was soo good.. comes with side salad and costs me only 9$. Server was so kind and quick. During my pittsburgh visit i believe this place will be on top of my restaurant list. They have a beautiful patio with umbrellas i love it.. you all gotta see this place"}
{"text":"From the outside, you'd think this cafe would be tiny, but they utilize their space pretty well and have an outdoor seating area too. We came for brunch on a Saturday and were seated right away indoors because there was no more space outside. The menu is plain and simple; they offer several omelettes, crepes, and French toast to choose from. We ordered the Spanikopita French toast (Baby Spinach, Feta, Asiago, Fresh Mozzarella, Balsamic Glaze), mocha French toast, and Swiss omelette. The Spanikopita French toast is the first savory French toast I've ever had and it was pretty good. The mocha French toast and Swiss omelette were unimpressive thoigh. The former was just bread soaked in chocolate with whipped cream on the side and the latter was just your typical omelette (a little dry though). Would recommend this place if you're looking for a casual brunch spot and I can imagine the brick-walled cafe being very cozy in the wintertime.

{"text":"The food and atmosphere was great! But, they only had 2 servers that also doubled as host and cashier.. Maybe someone had called off of work making them short, but the service time wasn't great. Would be back if they had more staff."}
{"text":"First thing, the umbrellas on the patio is the cutest decoration your new favorite brunch spot in PGH could have! The food and coffee are also to die for! I had the Veggie Omelet and their iced latte when I went and MAANNNN that smoked gouda cheese on the omelet!  DELICIOUS! The staff is also super friendly. Just an all around great brunch place, not only in the neighborhood but in the city!"}

{"text":"So I was pleasantly surprised by this place when I arrived. I thought this was just a little coffee shop that served simple breakfast items such as bagels. Boy, was I was I wrong. I had no idea this place had a lovely deck out back with rainbow colored umbrellas.  This place was very inviting and the staff was super friendly. I came in with my husband on Memorial Day for brunch and opted for the outdoor seating area.  Their menu was quite varied, and ranged from your typical omelettes, to some really intriguing sweet and salty crepes. 
They had a $20 brunch special which I highly recommend, you can pick your choice of fruit or salad, your entree, followed by one of their sweet crepes: nutella and banana, strawberry and apricot, or feta and honey. I opted for the salad, the Philly crepe, and the feta and honey desert crepe. 

We were served their coffee with is some strong delicious stuff, I usually have a ton of coffee when it's unlimited, but I totally met my coffee quota here. Really good stuff. The food itself was excellent. My salad had some spring greens and sliced tomato with this incredible creamy vinaigrette sauce. Despite the simplicity, it was excellent. My entree was really good, it was basically a cheese steak filling, with roasted peppers, caramelized onions and Gorgonzola cheese. This stuffed crepe was enormous and quite delicious. My husband had the Mediterranean omelette which had olives, roasted peppers, onions, and feta. This omelette was really well balanced and I loved the tang that the feta added.  For dessert, the honey feta crepe was really good, not overly sweet. Excellent desert.  

Overall I was very happy to stumble upon this place. I can't wait to return, especially since you can bring your own Champagne for mimosas!!"}
{"text":"I am SO glad we found this place! The inside is lovely and the patio is awesome - under a canopy of colorful umbrellas.

My husband and I had the brunch special: 1) fruit or salad, 2) an entree, 3) a crepe, and 4) unlimited coffee or OJ or a latte. The fruit was fresh, dusted with powdered sugar, and served with whipped cream. Our omlettes were giant and served with toasted Tuscan bread and mixed greens with creamy balsamic. The crepes were also giant and paper thin. I got bananas and Nutella - the perfect breakfast dessert. My mocha latter was the best I've had in a really long time. And we got all of that for only $20 per person. 

I absolutely plan on visiting for brunch again!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Sunday. They weren't too crowded as the outdoor patio was open. The cafe has a cute and quaint vibe. I started off with coffee and my friend had the chai. Tip, if you check in on yelp, the coffee is free! I had the apple brie crepe and my friend had the berry french toast. The crepe was delicious. They did not skimp on the brie so it was nice nice and melted. The crepe was topped with apples, walnuts, syrup, and powdered sugar. The french toast was also beautifully presented with berries and chocolate sauce. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food. They do charge automatically for mini water bottles from costco, which was a bit odd. Do want to come back to try a savory crepe!"}
{"text":"picked this place for brunch based on brunch spots on yelp close to my boyfriend's apartment. he and i both enjoyed our meals - he got an omelet while i went for a peroghie crepe. the place is small so be ready to wait if they're busy but we were literally the only people there when we went."}
{"text":"What a gem! Cute cozy cafe feel with delicious fresh food. Greater as soon as I walked in. I selected a yummy chai tea latte and fresh berry French toast. 
Neither disappointed. French toast was fresh, perfectly toasted. The toppings were fresh, flavorful and delicious. I can't wait to go back, so many other yummy items on the menu I need to try!"}
{"text":"If you get past the cute atmosphere and fancy yet intriguing sounding menu, this place is just alright. When you get water they give you tiny water bottles, but I felt bad drinking more than 2. I got the fig jam and Brie French toast which tasted like nothing. I was expecting to taste the fig and could just taste mush. One piece of French toast is very filling. Parking can be tricky too here."}
{"text":"Seemed disorganized. They seated us and we sat watching other people come in and have their orders taken (and drink orders arrive) before we flagged down a waitress and determined that they hadn't assigned us a server. They bring tiny bottles of water to each person and charge 50 cents per bottle, which seems both unnecessary and wasteful. Food was decent. Unlikely to come back."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here--great service, relaxed vibe, and my food is always excellent.  Great, affordable lunch spot in the area."}
{"text":"Honestly I have no idea what has taken me so long to patron this great little bistro; especially since it's within walking distance from my house. But hey, better late than never. We were the first customers for brekkie on Sunday and the wait for our food was a little longer than most places. However, that wasn't an issue because our meals were clearly prepared with a pride and passion for food. We started with a cheese plate that came with a crepe and marmalade and that could have been a shared meal itself. For main courses I had the pesto crepe with side salad and my boyfriend had the Polish Hill crepe with a side salad. You guessed it, his was similar to eating a pierogi with cheese, mashed potatoes and caramelized onions. I had s bite and it just melted in my mouth. And for me how can you go wrong with a pesto crepe? It literally tasted straight from the garden with fresh mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and the most fragrant basil. Service was very good and the interior is quaint, inviting and comfortable. They've even got a back dining patio. Everything about this place reminded me of Europe without trying too hard. It's a theme that flows organically throughout. Also want to mention that the menu has so many choices without being overwhelming or too much to take in."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my fiancé and it was exquisite, we enjoyed two savory crepes and then finished up with a classic Nutella crepe that we shared. The decor is beautiful, reminds me of a Parisian cafe in France. The walls are covered in beautiful photos and paintings, each one more beisroful than the other. The environment is intimate yet spacious. I can't wait to come back in the summer to sit out under the rainbow umbrellas on the terrace!"}
{"text":"Server inattentive. Got check before even silverware. Was served wrong food. Had to ask for our food, knowing it was ready after 25 min. Coffee refills sat at coffee bar until I got up and retrieved them, and they may have had three tables."}
{"text":"Caffe Mona you snuck up on me!  I was searching for a place to grab brunch and stumbled upon this place.  I didn't know where it came from, but apparently my friend pointed out that it used to be J'eet.  

It's really very homey inside.  I love the wood accents and casual feel.  What drew me in was a promise of fabulous french toast.  That promise was kept thankfully!  I love a good prix fixed menu and for $13.99 you can get three courses of breakfast goodness!  

First course was a fruit dish.  It was actually a plate full of apples, pears and watermelon.  Way bigger than I thought and fresh to boot.  The second course I choose the fig, apple and brie french toast.  The fig was baked into a large slice of french toast while the brie was melted on top adorned with a couple thinly sliced pieces of apple.  It was incredibly tasty and had a plentiful amount of fig!  

If the air issue is cleared up I'd happily hunker myself down here for a afternoon work sesh.  They offer free wifi and we even had a dude sitting next to us with his laptop out, so I feel like they're welcome to workers.  

The last course was an apricot preserve on a crepe.  The apricot was so so good!  It's definitely something you're not going to get everywhere.  I may have thought it was a lot of bread if they hadn't served that huge plate of fruit, so thanks for not making me feel guilty Caffe Mona!

The one complaint is that it was hot as Hades inside.  Like the oven's been on all day and we don't have a strong enough air conditioner/don't have one on at all hot.  It was pretty uncomfortable so good thing the food was a win or I may have been outta there by the first course!  As long as they get that under control I'd return.  

Looks like they're welcoming to workers considering they offer free wifi and we were sitting right next to a busy little worker bee next to us.  So pump that air and I'll spend the day ordering up some delish food and have a nice little work day!"}
{"text":"The barista was very pleasant and handed me one of the strongest cups of coffee I've had in a long time.  Not only did it help with the rest of my day but it had hit the spot...the roast that day was nutty and warming.  

They have a nice selection for bagel sandwiches as well.  They were able to accommodate with my lactose sensitivity and slabbed on some hummus instead.  They also had other alternatives.  The salmon was fresh and cured just right.  

It is conveniently located next to children's if anyone needs a break, you must stop by this spot!"}
{"text":"#1 go to brunch place in the city.. no matter what you choose from the menu it'll be great, beautifully served dish... make sure to check out the gorgeous back patio, rainbow umbrellas, nice service, the best coffee will give you all the vibes!
 P.S. Einstein is the sh*t"}
{"text":"Its great place for breakfast&lunch, i think they have brunch at weekends and i heard its so busy, i become a regular at Caffe mona, they are so friendly. I love the bagels and comes wt organic salad. Todat i tried apple brie... it was amazing.. def will return soon.. Caffe Mona rocks. Let me update yall this place is just my favorite spot now and everything is amazing.. HIGHLY Recommended!! The coffee is excellent!"}
{"text":"Another good spot for brunch in Pittsburgh!! My bf and I got different omelets, he got the \"southern\" which has mushroom and cheese and a salad. I got \"cherry\" with cherry tomatoes, bacon and swiss cheese, and a salad by the side, both are very good and just big enough to keep us full lol. The umbrellas weren't up when we went! Kind of disappointed. I like the inside of the cafe and their clean restroom. If I need to say something slightly not as perfect as anything else, it looks like they need a slightly better hood for the smoke to get out. Otherwise it is a lovely place to go to and people are all very nice. But please note they did charge for the little bottles of water so make sure you let them know that you do not need water if you don't want to have another $0.5."}
{"text":"This place deserves more than its current 3.5 rating. The food was really good (I had the goat cheese omelette which came with a nice side salad and a thick, fresh piece of bread). The waiter and cook (chef?) were both very friendly. Affordable. Nice ambiance (although the frames without pictures creeped me out a bit. Must be a hipster thing). If the weather is nice, get some fresh air on their elevated patio out back. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"We walked in and seated ourselves. Looked like they had a walk-up counter from which you could order from the outside. Unfortunately the back patio was closed at the time so we settled for a high top table. The interior was decorated with large eclectic art pieces and empty picture frames.

My friend and I ordered two coffees and two crepe entrees for under $25. We split one savory and one sweet, the Polish hill and the Nutella banana. Food came out with minimal wait. Presentation was great and the crepes were absolutely delicious! Very fulfilling. Good portions and an even better price."}
{"text":"Cute place, yummy coffee. The morning we came there was only one cook working and the service was very slow even after we told the server we had a time constraint. If you go, plan to wait."}
{"text":"this is such a nice place I like to go to, I think their omelettes and lattes are the best in town. and the owners are really very friendly and hard workers.They recently remade the patio and those colorful umbrellas look just phenomenal. I feel so peaceful sitting in that patio and eat my delicious breakfast on Saturday mornings.  if you didn't try this place before you definitely should because I think you're missing a lot."}
{"text":"Cafe Mona was great! I went to visit my friends for the weekend and boy let me tell you!! This place was a great call. it looked like a secret spot at first because I am not that familiar with Pittsburgh, haha!! 

The food was great. We had pretty much everything on the menu, we were a group of 6 and we love sharing. 

Also, coffee was fabulous as well! We had black coffee which was served well and they were really good with refilling our coffee at no extra charge. 

More importantly, the staff was really friendly and service was casual, fun, and fast!!! We got to meet and talk to everybody works there. YES!!! the staff was that amazing!

We also sat outside and enjoyed our brunch. I still can't get over how cute & fabulous their outdoor patio is. Highly recommended!! This place is easily getting a 5 star."}
