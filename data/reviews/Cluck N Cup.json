{"text":"I ordered the asian chicken wrap. There was not much flavor. I was hoping for some sauce inside with lots of asian flavor like sesame oil, cilantro, or lime. It had none of that and was very bland. Inside the spinach wrap was broccoli slaw, dry shredded chicken, sunflower seeds, and crumbled up ramen noodles. The two positives were quick service and my side of broccoli casserole was very good. My husbands ham sandwich came on cheap slightly stale white bread with subpar deli meat ham."}
{"text":"I had a chicken caesar wrap, the wrap was a green one denoting it was spinach. A pretty standard green flour tortilla wrap, but the contents were certainly worth the money. They load the wrap with real chicken breast meat that appears to be cut off a rotisserie chicken! It's very good along with the fresh romaine, and shredded asiago (?) Cheese stuffed inside. It was rolled nice & tight so it wasn't messy at all. My only gripe would be that they need to add more Caesar dressing or make the chicken more moist. I mean, it is loaded with chicken but the breast meat can be a bit dry. All in all, would def go back to to get a Wrap, or their pot pie-heard it was to die for good :)"}
{"text":"Tried out Cluck N Cup for the first time today for lunch. The lunch special for today(Thursday) was the Chicken Quesadilla with Salsa, Sour Cream and a Drink so I decided to go with that. I also got a side of chips(Lays Barbecue). Overall it was only about $7-$8 so pretty cheap. The quesadilla was just chicken and cheese then I dipped it in their salsa. The chicken and tortilla were really good and the cheese was..well cheese. The salsa also was pretty good. Overall, I was pleased with my visit. Maybe next time I will try their speciality, the Chicken Pot Pie."}
{"text":"Been going to Cluck N Cup every Wednesday for the past 4 months for their chicken pot pie. My coworkers introduced me to this place when I came to Charlotte, and I certainly recommend it to everyone who is looking to get a great-tasting pot pie for the price of a JJ sandwich. The staff is very friendly and always seems to go out of their way to make sure you leave satisfied. I haven't tried anything on their menu except the pot pie, but I love it. It's always fresh and delicious. Great place for a lunch gathering."}
{"text":"The food and service were completely mediocre.  I think this place survives only because of it's location and proximity to the courthouse.  Hop on your trolley and head down to Viva Chicken, Earl's Grocery, or one of the other excellent venues on Elizabeth closer to Presbyterian Hospital if you're looking for a more satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Ordered the chicken Caesar wrap with a side of broccoli casserole. My food came out in minutes. It was tasty and fresh. The wrap was ok but the broccoli casserole was great. The location is perfect for people watching. The staff was friendly. A good experience!"}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch and found the place quiet, but I got the impression that the place gets a good lunch crowd.  According to the hours on the door, it's actually only open for breakfast and lunch, and closed on Sundays.  The decor is comfortable.  The walls are painted with bright colors, there's a variety of booths and tables, and it's an open space with a high ceiling.  You seat yourself and get your own drinks, but they deliver the food to you.    I ordered a chicken quesadilla and found it delicious.  Gooey cheese inside, big pieces of chicken, perfectly cooked.  Jalapenos are an option for those who want it a little spicier.  The salsa is homemade, as are the desserts.  We tried the lemon bars and they definitely tasted homemade -- good stuff!  The quesadillas were served in baskets, and we were also given plates painted with chickens (cute!).  The chicken pot pies are supposed to be amazing, although when they run out for the day, they're out.  So get there earlier in the day if you want to make sure you get one.  The menu is not that extensive (mainly sandwiches, salads, and specialties like quesadillas, white bean chili, pot pies, shrimp tacos, etc), but prices are fairly reasonable.  We got the impression that they try to produce quality food from a smaller menu instead of creating a vast mediocre selection.  I can appreciate that.  The manager (I think) was friendly and welcoming.  Even though we came just before closing, he encouraged us to take our time and not feel rushed.    The only con, in my opinion, is the limited hours.  We'd love to be able to go there for dinner.  Even so, though, we will make a point to come back sometime (hopefully early enough for the pot pies!)."}
{"text":"Great chicken pot pie and Asian slaw.  Friendly service good prices.  Just a little limited on the menu.  Definitely Recommend."}
{"text":"The chicken pot pie is excellent! I highly recommend it to anyone. They homemade the pie in the restaurant. It takes about 10 minutes after ordering because it is fresh. They also offer it in a take and bake fashion if you cannot stay.  The broccoli casserole was recommended, but I personally did not like it. They do offer other side dishes with each meal however. They offered daily specials & a weekly salad special as well.   The staff was very friendly, and when I was there the owner was working the counter. He was very passionate about the food that they were serving.   I went with a coworker and we both highly enjoyed it. I look forward to returning soon. It is a great lunch destination if you are in the Northlake area.   Credit cards were accepted."}
{"text":"This is one of Charlotte's hidden gems. Occasionally my job brings me to the Mecklenburg County Courthouse, and it's always a great excuse for lunch at C&C.   Friendly, helpful staff. Their pot pie is to die for, and the broccoli casserole side dish is a family favorite too.   I recently discovered they do breakfast, too, and has become a nice spot to try out too. They'll convert their lunch quesadilla into something awesome and breakfast-friendly if you ask.   And validates parking!"}
{"text":"Coffee not very hot. Egg sandwich from the microwave with microwaved bacon on a bagel that was really a roll with a hole. You have to boil it first for it to be a bagel."}
{"text":"I read on YELP that their specialty was the chicken pot pie. I ordered it and was not disappointed.  Crust was flaky, inside was hot and full of goodies. I would have liked more chicken inside but I ALWAYS WANT MORE MEAT...so it probably had the appropriate amount.   This was my first visit (very convenient for jury duty). Next time I'll try the chicken Caesar wrap!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a amazing chicken pot pie.....look no further! This pot pie is stuffed with delicious chicken, the crust is light and flaky and yes there are yummy vegetables. Other pot pies I have tried were mostly vegetables but that is not the case at Cluck N Cup. You definitely get your monies worth and the flavor is amazing! Considering we were passing thru Charlotte we are happy to see that they have online ordering and can ship anywhere. If you haven't had a chance to try one of their locations please don't miss out. The staff is friendly. The restaurant was very clean. We took a family sized pie with us to our final destination and it was a big hit!"}
{"text":"Cluck 'N Cup serves up Coffee, Chicken Pot Pies, Chicken Nachas, Chicken Wraps, Chicken etc... and from what I can tell its all worth checking out. Inside you'll find a relaxed cafe vibe with flowers, artwork, and plenty of chicken. We ended up going with the nachos, quesadilla, chicken salad, asian salad, and a bbq wrap.  The chicken nachos were piled high with mounds of Mexican cheeses, grilled chicken, fresh made salsa and sour cream. Outside of an authentic Mexican restaurant... these may just be the best nachos we've found in the queen city. My little brother got the bbq chicken wrap which came wrapped in a spinach tortilla and was stuffed with grilled chicken, BACON!!!!!!!, melty cheese, and bbq sauce. I could barely get a good picture of it before he had it completely devoured. I went with the chicken quesadilla with a side of fresh made salsa and sour cream. The tortilla was crispy, flaky, almost a little buttery... and 100% delicious. The cheese and grilled chicken were plentiful and more than enough to fill me up. If you closed your eyes, you'd almost think you made this quesadilla right at home :)  The side of cole slaw was pretty average...  My dad got the Asian Salad with grilled chicken breast, mixed greens, shredded cabbage, carrots, almonds, sunflower seeds and crunchy noodles with an Asian dressing. Aside from being one of the BIGGEST salads we've ever come across.. it was also one of the best we've ever had. The real star of the salad was the mind blowing Asian dressing.. it may not seem like there's much in the small bowl but I can guarantee that a lot goes a long way.  Not expecting the salad to be quite so BIG... my dad also got the chicken salad sandwich with a side of broccoli casserole. All in all the sandwich was pretty average but the broccoli casserole ended up being a big hit at the table. Cluck 'N Cup ended up being a lot more than we had expected. The food was amazing, the service was on point, and in general the place rocks."}
{"text":"This place is just Ok.. I had the Wednesday special chicken pot pie + side + drink for $7.. I would have been disappointed had I paid more, because although the pot pie was prepared fast and was hot.. It was basically bland! Needed salt, pepper, onion or SOMETHING.. The crust was the best part, it was buttery on top and perfectly baked. The chicken inside was all breast meat, large pieces that could have been delicious, had they been seasoned at all."}
{"text":"I picked up a couple of take-and-bake pot pies from here.  They are quite tasty, just the right size for an individual, and easy on the wallet at 6 bucks each.  I haven't been to any of the other locations, but this one is new, clean and cozy inside.  The folks at the register are smiley and friendly.  I'll probably make another trip to try the \"cup\" portion and see what their coffee is like, but I would definitely return for the chicken pot pie, either in-house or take-and-bake."}
{"text":"I ordered the veggie wrap. There wasn't a gluten free option so I asked for the contents of the wrap in a bowl. This was a mistake because I ended up with 2 tablespoons of hummus, shredded carrots, 2 lettuce leaves and a side of pineapples and strawberries for $7.00. They had forgotten to put avocado into the concoction but were happy to do so when I came back and asked. I don't know that I would come back here."}
{"text":"Employees need training. Not one smile, no thank you.  Coffee-meh. Strong but not flavor and I drink it black, so can taste the real coffe. Chicken pot pie, slightly above average (frozen)...ingredients, veggies, seemed fresh, very little chicken. Hot sauce was supplied in tiny packets. Had the feeling this was a probation employee facility. Doubt I'll be giving this place another try, sorry. Staff needs major overhaul."}
{"text":"Looking for a place other than Shomar's for your lunch break while uptown? The Cluck N Cup is a short walk away from most of the government building located on 4th street. The Daily specials were visible as you came in. The soup of the day was white chili- my first choice, but they were out of soup. Out of soup at noon?! That was rather disappointing. I hear that Cluck N Cup is known for their chicken pot pie. My lunch partner swears by it and says this dish is his go to meal when he visits Cluck N Cup. He attempted to convince me to order it, but I already knew what I wanted- Cobb salad with the healthier choice of  balsamic dressing. The salad was neatly built with lots of color. I ordered my salad for a dine-in experience, but it was served as take out in a to go box. The more I think about it, the more that this makes sense. Some folks may not finish their whole salad so of it's served in a to go box then the customer has that container already available. So, the healthier choice of balsamic dressing just wasn't complementing my salad the way I would've liked it to...creamy blue cheese dressing was the second string choice but was the most complimentary option  for this salad. My least favorite part of the salad was the chicken, which was very dry. It seemed like it was the left over chicken that wasn't used in the pot pie. I'll have to try the pot pie next time to compare :)."}
{"text":"Out of the daily special (Chicken Salad Wrap) in the middle of lunch...that's irresponsible, Poor management, bad for business,and just plain dumb! You don't run out of the daly special in the middle of lunch..ever! AND IF YOU DO, KINDLY OFFER A SUBSTITUTE!!!  Also the person working the register was slow as molasses, three people left in the 8 minutes I waited in line... Two people ahead of me and I waited 8 minutes during the end of lunch rush!  Also, Please have whoever is working the register be a little friendly, greet people, and say thank you... She didn't do that!  I'm sure you've worked very hard to build this business, you're losing customers... Take another look at things!  You're losing business!"}
{"text":"On a visit to Uptown we came across this place while we were very hungry and decided to try it out. The interior is nice and bright with big windows. The menu is simple and not overwhelming, and everything looks delicious. We got breakfast. Justin had an egg, sausage and cheese bagel and I ordered the bagel and lox, but they were out of lox so I just replaced it with ham. It was really good, everything tasted fresh.   The prices were stupid reasonable for uptown; maybe because it's a little bit tucked away. Coffee was really good too. The guy at the counter was really nice and accommodating. If I find myself in that part of Uptown again, I'll definitely pop in, at least for a coffee."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday.  Unfortunately they were out of lettuce and tomatoes so the chicken salad I ordered was a bit on the sweet side.  My husband ordered the barbecue chicken wrap and enjoyed it immensely even though he is not a wrap kind of guy.  The place was empty,  small in a cute way,  but very clean and inviting.  I'd come again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I eat here a few times a month.  I really like their salads; they're huge.  Their chicken salad wrap with broccoli cheese casserole on the side is also another favorite.  I'll enjoy the Friday lasagna special only if I've been good all week!  Cluck N Cup is one of the best options when you are near the Courthouse or Government Center."}
{"text":"ALL BAD EXPERIENCES HERE!!!!!  If a place can't get a simple egg sandwich and coffee right then I have infinite confidence that they can not do anything else right either.  I have been 3 times and each time it has been a struggle for them to put ketchup on my egg sandwich.  Each time I was the only customer and each time I clearly told them what I wanted and heard them clearly tell the cook to do it.  One of the times I waited for like 3 minutes for them to get me ketchup after they already handed me my sandwich.  The bacon was clearly microwaved for it.  The coffee I ordered was absolutely wretched as well.  THIS PLACE BITES, try again owners!"}
{"text":"This is for the Southend Drive location. Cute neighborhood atmosphere and friendly staff. Very cozy... you get the 'I'm getting a homecooked meal' sensation right away. The daily specials are amazingly priced. I had the lasagna with garlic bread! It was a daily special around $6 with a drink.  Definitly a lunch spot I plan on hitting up again!"}
{"text":"Super great staff. I always call my order in on my way to work and its ready by the time I get there.   I like the shakes, and breakfast items. I have actually never been here for lunch but I hear they get crowded.  There is a daily special each day but I never found the time to get out there and try it out."}
{"text":"Food was lack luster and service was worse. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad with a water and was given a chicken Caesar wrap and never saw my water. I even reminded the cashier about it and she still didn't get it together. After bringing me a wrap I told her I ordered the salad and she told me that I was wrong and I ordered the wrap. I'm not sure how you can tell the person who ordered that they are wrong. The other cashier had an attitude with other customers as well. I'd give the wrap a solid 2 out of 5. The chicken was a dry, overcooked disaster and the Asian slaw I had was a cup of oil. Only giving 2 stars because they had wifi available. Total garbage of a restaurant top to bottom."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried their chicken pot pie and broccoli casserole on Wednesdays for their special, then you are in for a TREAT!!! For $7.50, you get the yummy pot pie, a side, and a tea.  This pot pie crust is so flaky and soft. The chicken is fresh and has a hearty quantity.  The broccoli casserole is moist and has a good cheddar cheese hint to it.  They sell a lot of different foods that I've tried (Asian salad is the bomb), and this Wednesday special is the BEST pot pie I've had in a long time.  I gave the place four stars instead of five because the cost for most other items is too much, and the staff is a bit standoffish."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago, we went for a nice Saturday Brunch.  Second time we tries because the first was over a holiday weekend and they deviated from their normal schedule but no problem. We finally made it.  Despite all the hype, I can honestly say this as a bit of let down.  Very little taste to the Chicken Pot Pie, very little Chicken and a crust like cardboard.  Server was friendly but little responce from the back so service was slow. At least the coffee is good.  Would not recommend. Food is nothing to write home about, service is adequat but can't blame them because they are not getting the orders from the kitchen promptly and they are trying.  Restaurant is an interesting concept but needs a lot of refining."}
{"text":"Validating parking for my court visit has never been so surprisingly enjoyable.  I can only speak for the Chicken white bean tomato-based soup, but it was stellar.  The chicken was lean, cooked right, and had grill marks on it. Why did I only get a cup?    I enjoyed chatting with one of the two owners for about 25 minutes....Sheesh - I wanted to become a business partner.  Seriously - really good people trying to provide a good product at a reasonable price.  The sub shop next store truly has no advantage over this place - Go to Cluck N Cup!"}
{"text":"Giving three stars because of the chicken pot pie and they validate parking.  However, the \"turkey hoagie melt\" is not at all as fancy as the place or name make it seem and for $8.85, a waste of money.  It is literally two pieces of wheat toast from a grocery (not the good/fancy stuff either) toasted with turkey and cheese... They didn't have any bacon when I ordered and didn't find out until after I paid so they added additional turkey in place of the bacon (not the same at all but, A for effort).  The sides leave a lot to be desired as well and their chips... Plain lays or bbq- not the homemade style that most deli's offer with their deli style sandwiches.  Needless to say, we won't be visiting again other than when we want a really good, homemade style chicken pot pie."}
{"text":"Decent food, convenient location. They have a lunch special everyday that is usually reasonable, but for the most part this place is over priced. Lots of seating inside. Sides are the best bet"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out while on lunch from serving jury duty. I was going to go to Quizno's but the line was too long. The service was pleasant and quick, the barista was really nice and the cook that brought out my food was cool too. I ordered a mocha latte and the spinach artichoke dip with chips. The latte was tasty, though had a slight burnt taste. I didn't mind too much since I needed the latte to wake me up a bit. The spinach artichoke dip was ok, but the chips were good and hot. I was hoping for more of a cheese based dip but it seemed to be more creamy. A bit tangy-sour like mayo, sour cream, or cream cheese, which I'm not a big fan of. Besides all that I'd still give this place another try. The latte was good, but i'd try something different to eat on the menu, maybe the chicken pot pie mmm!"}
{"text":"This cute little place is right across the street from the courthouse, which is a blessing when you're on jury duty and want to eat something that's not from the courthouse cafeteria, or your run of the mill fast food.  One of their specialties is a chicken pot pie, so I ordered that.  I'm not a frequent consumer of pot pies so I don't have a lot of basis for comparison, but this one was good.  The crust was light and flaky and crispy, and the inside had a creamy gravy and nice chunks of chicken breast and some vegetables.   They had it out to me in just minutes, too."}
{"text":"Quick service, good coffee, good selection of cafe food.  Their drink variations aren't as extensive as the bigger names but I enjoyed what I ordered- skinny mocha latte. My husband says the house coffee was a bit watered down, though."}
{"text":"Had jury duty and this place was right across the street. Had decent Yelp reviews so since it was close by gave it a try. They're known for their chicken pot pies but I wasn't in the mood so I ordered the House Salad with chicken added for $1. Not bad to add chicken. The salad is advertised as having mixed greens, hearts of palm, avocado, sugared walnuts and crumbled bleu cheese raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Several of my favs in one salad - walnuts, avocado and bleu cheese dressing. The salad was huge, however, I could barely see any avocado. There was plenty of sugared walnuts however. I enjoyed the salad nonetheless. I'm deducting 1 star due to the missing avocado and another due to the dirty table that I had to wipe down myself. OAN their floor is very sticky. Someone needs to buy a mop."}
{"text":"I'm so sad they closed this place. I just recently tried it for the first time a couple weeks ago. All I ever hear about is the chicken pot pie and boy was it good! The Broccoli casserole was really good as well . This location will be missed"}
{"text":"This place has been on my mind for a while, every time I am down town I see and say I have to go in there to see what it's all about.  So last Friday I had some business down town I had to take care of so I decided to finally go into cluck n cup.  The atmosphere is really beatiful it's a nice place really clean, smell good nice people.  I got the pot pie, and I'm use to really super good pot pies, and being that this place is about the chicken I expected that it would live up to all my expectations.  Well let's just say I enjoyed the brownie that I got after I had my pot pie.  The chicken in it was juicy and great, the vegetable part of it tasted like they open up a can of vegetable soup and poured it in the crust and cooked it.  I'm very upset that it did not taste better than I thought it would have but oh well.  I said I wanted to try it and I did, just never again.  I took my mama with me, and she enjoyed her chef salad very much the ranch dressing was homemade so it was very good.  But I will not be going back, but it was nice to get out down town and walk around and try new places."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out this quaintly named restaurant for breakfast this morning.  The decor is quite cute, plenty of seating, even a couple of nice leather chairs should you drop by with a friend for a simple coffee.  The windows advertise catering services are offered as well.  However, I noticed right away that the entry floor was in need of a serious sweeping.  As we perused the menu, I seriously considered making the awkward decision to do an about-face and go to Mimi's, perhaps allowing the ladies working the Cluck-n-Cup time to find a broom, a few spray bottles, and some clean dishrags; but my husband placed his order for an omelette.  He was told it would be about fifteen minutes... for an omelette?  I ordered a breakfast croissant sandwich and we both asked for coffee and water.  We were given two styrofoam cups of coffee at the register and two of water.  Seriously? Ceramic mugs and at least plastic glasses should be the norm in any restaurant.  When asked if we'd like cream, our cashier/waitress told us to hold on a minute.  She went to the back and returned with our creamer, in the quart carton you'd pull out of the case at your local grocery store, and let us pour it ourselves before we walked over to the sugar station.    We walked by plenty of booths where both table and seating needed to be wiped down, as well as more evidence of the neglect of floors. As for our breakfast, my husband liked his omelette quite well.  My sandwich was nothing special.  My husband asked me to sit facing the window so that the TWO people \"working\" the morning shift in this restaurant devoid of any customers besides ourselves would not see my face.  I don't think the one standing at the front counter would have looked up from her computer screen long enough to notice anything amiss.  We both stopped by the bathroom before leaving.  Dirty everything, and trash hanging out of the trashcan.  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Got the Salmon and cream cheese sandwich it was decent. The Vanilla latte coffee was way too sweet."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast as it next door to my hotel and prior reviews were good. This must be a lunch place as I was the only customer at 8am on a TUE and they did not have coffee ready. Service was indifferent and S soon as I ordered I wished I hadn't - and styrofoam cups - really?"}
{"text":"NEVER see many people inside.  coffee, ok.  for somewhere within walking distance of court, it'll do.    not sure how they stay in business.  woman working front counter nice.  expresso / late machine perpetually broken.  go with standard cup-of-Joe.    guys in back always seem to be eating McDonalds (no kidding) and doing close to nothing.    frankly the food-prep-while-eating Mickey D's grossed me out.  seems to be a whole lot of doing nothing back there, which makes sense since no one seems to be ordering the food.    they HAVE to be getting discounted rent / special dispensation from the county.  no other business would have survived this long.    i'll drink the hot coffee. won't eat there without Imodium.  Cup, not Cluck thank you."}
{"text":"Came here during jury duty. Got the pot pie with a side of broccoli casserole.  Pot pie was great.  Casserole was good/ok (I would have liked more broccoli in it).   Served VERY fast and hot.  Very nice staff.  Clean place and great for people watching."}
{"text":"Chicken pot pie!!  It's so very good! Honestly everything I've Tried there was really good. Broccoli soup,chicken salad, and desserts. My office is right across the street and we had them cater breakfast one morning. The breakfast casserole was so good!"}
{"text":"I have never been to the location in South End even though I have driven through there plenty of time (on my way to the nail shop in the same complex). But recently I had to be at the Mecklenburg County Courthouse for various things, and since the closest parking garage is the one by this Cluck N Cup, I stopped in to get a quick bite (and to validate my parking ticket). I like it, something about the big glass windows and sun shining in make it very peaceful. My first visit I ended up doing work here (armed with an iPad, free wifi and remote log in).  My go to breakfast item is their breakfast sandwish with ham, egg, cheese on toasted croissant ($3.99). FABULOUS! Their regular coffee is good too, not the watery kind but has a good robust taste to it.  They also serve lunch and are open on weekends. Quite honestly their price is very reasonable for being uptown.  P.S. Remember the parking validation is only good for 90 minutes ($3 worth)."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a quick bite around lunchtime on a Saturday. It was fairly quiet with plenty of open booths. Our food was hot, fresh and very delicious!   The BBQ chicken wrap was made with shredded chicken I imagine was cooked same day in house, very much unlike some places with cubed, bagged, frozen then thawed chicken pieces. It was served warm, which was kind of a surprise, but as it turns out a nice one.   The chicken pot pie was, as others have mentioned, delightful. I hadn't had chicken pot pie in a while, but it really hit the spot on a cold and cloudy day. There was a lot of chicken though, I'm sure that's most people's preference, but I wish it was more veggie heavy.  On top of all of that, their staff was courteous, and they serve coke products which is always a win for me. Their prices are more than reasonable, and most if not all daily specials have a drink and side included in their $5-$6 price range. It's a great value."}
{"text":"Cluck N-NOM-NOM-NOM Cup!!  This place is soooo good!! Always large portion sizes and great taste!! It smells like home cooking the minute you walk in the door and the service is quick, polite and so wonderful.   I always get the Asian Salad with extra crunchy noodles on the side - YUMM!  Best Tip about this place: everything is made FRESH!   Sad Tip - two of their locations are only open until 4pm aka lunch only"}
{"text":"This is a small cafe diagonally across the street from Mecklenburg County Courthouse at the 2nd level of the parking deck. They offer coffee and breakfast in the mornings and have a lunch menu of sandwiches, wraps, salads and chicken pot pie.  The staff has been wonderful in my two visits here. Very friendly. Prices are reasonable here and they also give a discount to jurors so make sure you wear your juror badge.    The seating is actually comfortable padded chairs mostly with low top tables but there are 2 high top table and a comfortable seating area in the in the front corner.  With few restaurants within walking distance of the courthouse, this is a nice find."}
