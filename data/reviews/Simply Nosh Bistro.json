{"text":"The french toast is amazing. Comes with a crunch piece, one stuffed with cream cheese and a regular one. I love the crunchy one. Just make sure to get the big juice when you go. It's only a dollar more and double the amount of juice.  Liked our waiter. He was charming.  It's a great environment with nice art on the walls and great antiques. The record player adds a nice touch."}
{"text":"Slippage. I went in today for lunch and had a drastically different experience. The first item of contention was a $1 increase in price of the sandwiches across the board and when I ordered the takeout veal cutlet I received only the sandwich for the full price. I did not receive the potatoes or the mixed greens as advertised on the menu. This is what disappointment feels like. It might be some time before I decide to visit again.  Service; it's all about the little touches. If you lose them, chances are, you lose me as a customer as well."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. I had a chance to chat with the chef, who followed his dream of opening a resto. All the food we ordered for brunch was delicious. The quality of ingredients (fresh, organic) was amazing. I highly recommend anything that comes with eggs and potatoes."}
