{"text":"Being a fan of Broaster chicken, I was excited when Sheriff offered a Groupon deal.  I hand't heard of them, so looked them up and found out that they're fairly new (looks like opened in the spring?).  I took a chance and bought a coupon.  On a recent Friday evening, I decided to pay the store a visit.  There were 3 tables with people, but nobody was eating...not a good sign.  I walked up to the counter, and saw 3 people scrambling behind the counter in the kitchen area, looking overwhelmed and confused.  I was acknowledged after about 5 minutes and asked to wait.  After some time, one set of customers finally got their order and left.  The man then took my order, and told me it'll be ready in 20 minutes.  I ran some errands and came back at about 25 minutes and was told our order was not ready yet.  One of the parties that was there waiting when I was placing our order was STILL there!  The phone rang and rang, and went ignored.  It wasn't as though the place was super busy;  it was just that the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing - the 3 people behind the counter were not coordinated / organized and did not work as a team to get orders out.    Finally, after an additional 25 -30 minutes (so almost an hour in total), our order was ready.  I checked our order very thoroughly, because I had a sense that things would not be perfect.  Indeed one of my sides was missing - I was told they forgot to make it.  With the broasting process, I know that it takes time, so I agreed to take a coleslaw instead.  They were extremely apologetic, but considering it's mostly a take-out joint, the overall turn-around time is just not acceptable.  All this to say it's such a shame!  The chicken was actually really good!  I had ordered the spicy, and there was a nice flavourful \"kick\".  Even the coleslaw and potato salad were good.  But was it worth me waiting almost an hour for my order?  No...there's fried chicken everywhere these days.  Granted, not the same as broasted chicken, but they are much faster.  There is potential here because the quality of food is good - they need a manager who can coordinate the kitchen staff, so that they're not stumbling over each other, and can churn out the food faster!!    I'll give them one more try, the next time I head to Mississauga.  This would have been a 1-star review, but the chicken was good enough to bump it up to 3-stars."}
{"text":"Excellent!  I did not expect much walking into this corner shop of this dinky strip mall. But I was amazed at the good customer service as well as the delicious food.  I ordered the cheddar and jalapeno waffle sandwich . It was definitely made to perfection. The jalapenos gave the waffle a nice kick. The chicken was moist, juicy, crispy and very flavourful. The only thing was I love cheese and was expecting more on the waffle as it is named \"cheddar and jalapeno\" so I would have preferred a lot more cheese on the waffle. The chipotle, spicy mayo, dill pickle, coleslaw all came together very nicely.  The fries could definitely be improved, they tasted like they were from a store bought packet.  Overall, the taste and cost of the main dish was on point, the restaurant was clean and the service was friendly. I look forward to eating her often :)"}
{"text":"I went there a couple of weeks ago. I really wanted to try the jalapeño chicken waffle sandwich and was very disappointed as it was undercooked. I ordered take out so when I went back to my place, I tried to fry it on my stove but still it was undercooked. I had to throw it away, which made me very sad.   I am giving it three stars because I have had their broast chicken and chicken burger which are very tasty."}
{"text":"Best chicken waffle sandwich! The waffle is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside! Reasonably priced too! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating here from a recent visit from California. I love broaster chicken and am very picky about the quality of broast since I compare any broaster restaurant to Al Bake, the middle-eastern chain that is the standard for all broaster chicken. Many restaurants will tout regularly fried chicken as broast. There is a difference. The fryer is different and the cooking method is also different from regular fried chicken. This place is authentic broaster chicken.  Although it's in an older plaza, the restaurant is new and clean. The owner is very nice, friendly and accommodating. The seating area is not huge but was big enough to accommodate us, a party of 7, after combining two tables.  Food took a few minutes, which is expected since they cook it fresh after you place the order. I love that. Chicken comes hot and freshly cooked.  I missed not having the sesame seed buns that I have come to expect with broast chicken. Being new, they were either not carrying them yet or must have run out recently. Anyway, the owner was nice enough to offer a replacement.   Food was very tasty, fresh and not a single thing I could point towards that was wrong or off with it. Garlic sauce was good. Could have been more garlicky for my taste.   I am very happy to have a broast restaurant again in the area and each time I visit, I am sure to swing by at least once."}
{"text":"We had chicken and fish,flavours or spice in chicken is mild, Very tender chicken,  Excellent french fries. The only missing is the salad or green options with meals .Nice service, clean place,the plaza location is not very welcome, however it deserve another visit."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my boyfriend. I've had chicken and waffles in Toronto, but he has never had any at all. We were definitely not disappointed. The place is fairly priced and cooked so fresh. I was very pleased with the outcome, and let's just say that my boyfriend has a new favourite food. Will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"I had the Holy Rooster for $11.49. For a place that claims to have fresh food, the chicken tastes more frozen than a woolly mammoth that died in the last Ice Age. I might be delusional, but generally speaking, fresh doesn't mean \"freshly frozen.\" It means not frozen. This isn't a difficult concept. The waffle had very little jalapeño flavour, and the cheese tasted like Cheese Whiz. It really didn't taste better than a mediocre \"waffle\" (I use this term loosely) from the frozen food section at Walmart.  The people working mocked customers 24/7. Comments about weight, intelligence, clothes, looks, and payments were made.  Would I go again? Yes, I would, if I could put \"OUT OF BUSINESS\" signs on it."}
{"text":"The review below was written a week ago, but my most recent visit there deserves a ONE star.  I'm giving it two stars because your experience will really depend on the customer service.  Two Indian guys were manning the station last night and boy were they pissed.  They only allowed french fries as the side.  They told me they're not sherriff broaster but Broast Inn.... ok buddy, your box still says sherriff broaster but ok.. I get it the company changed names, but that's just  a scam.  Anyways, they were pissed, they were rude.  They made sure to tell each other to put only SIX onion rings.  Ummm okkkkkk. and they forgot my \"biscuit\"... or didnt bother to give it to me.  This place had potential to be good, but because of their rudeness, it's super BAD.  Previous review some nice caucasian lady served me.  I called in my order for lunch just because I didn't wanna wait.  The lady was working there alone and put me on hold and never hang up.  She apologized for putting me on hold and was very patient.  I decided to just show up there wherein the lady was very courteous and pleasant.  Needless to say, great customer service!  The chicken was made fresh.  It's a decent size and it comes with ranch dipping sauce on the side.  It was an odd combination.  I thought it was garlic dipping sauce on the side.  There is some hint of something I cannot explain, some after taste that I didn't particularly enjoy.  Hence why I can't give this place a five star.  Maybe it's just my preference, maybe I just don't enjoy Broaster chicken.  But maybe you would, so go ahead and give it a try.  I must say that the meat itself was tender, but the skin was soggy.  The sides were pretty good.  I really loved the wedges.  The macaroni salad was a good portion for an individual.  I didn't finish mine in one sitting.  The chicken I ordered was spicy, but it wasn't hot spicy, maybe just flavoured.  Maybe this was the after taste I didn't particularly enjoy, or maybe it was the weird ranch dressing I'm not sure.    I guess I can try it again and see if I end up liking it more."}
{"text":"Chicken was hot and tender and waffles were great tasting.  A surprise to find this in the neighborhood strip mall."}
{"text":"Waffle sandwich is huge and tastes great!  Maybe a little too much sauce as the waffles soak it it up and it becomes soggy but worth the price!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. They fry the chicken right after u order and everything is FRESH and u taste the difference. Very underrated and probably the best chicken and waffles I have had."}
{"text":"I'm very sad to be writing this review, because I seldom give out such low ratings, but Broast Inn and the staff who regularly work there are so rude it's ridiculous-- and I'm not even being oversensitive here, other yelpers have said similar things! We'll talk about the food shortly, but first, the service. It can take over 20 minutes to receive your food even when it's not busy, and the place seems to prioritise take-out or delivery. The biggest issue, though, is that the workers in the back talk a lot of crap in Urdu thinking that the patrons they're talking about won't understand. What prompted this low rating is that specifically, because the things that were said during my last visit were vile. Workers made fun of an Arabic couple who came in because of the clothes one of them was wearing, and they spent several minutes making fun of a man because of his weight.. while he was ordering food for his family, and this was his first visit. The man spoke in English, and I was horrified to hear the awful things that the workers were saying about him, and unfortunately, so was he-- he, looking completely white, responded in Urdu and told them off and left without buying anything. It was so incredibly unprofessional and none of them expected the man to be able to answer them, and they didn't even apologise. I told them off as well, even more to their surprise because I'm white-passing, and was absolutely disgusted with them, because you do not discriminate against customers based on their bodies or clothing, especially not loudly enough that anyone in the restaurant can hear.   As for the food, it's nothing special. The waffle sandwiches are often drenched in sauce to hide extremely bland chicken. The mediocre food, vulgar staff, and long wait times make this a place to be missed for sure. If I could give them 0 stars I would, I would rather give my money to people who treat their customers better."}
{"text":"This is the second branch of Sheriff and opened only three weeks. They have an excellent set of deals as Opening Specials. 10 pieces of chicken for $13.99 is one of the specials. The chicken was very good. Not oily! I didn't even feel like throwing up like I do after Popeyes! Plus, the front staff and manager was super nice! They even gave free small icecream to my wife and I, on the house! Very surprisingly nice customer service! All brown/Asian restaurant owners should come here to learn a thing or two about how to run a business!   To the Sheriff (Mississauga) Staff: Please keep up the same customer care even after you have passed the \"Grand Opening\" phase. You're doing wonderful! God Bless!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but any place that is rude and inconsiderate enough to post NO hours on their door, or online...gets a bad review from me. The only thing I'm offered is wasted time and gas."}
{"text":"I would say that the food was alright, and the cashier kind, but the wait time was ridiculous. Please keep in mind that this was my first time trying chicken & waffles so I am not even too sure what combinations of sauces and so forth lead to the best meal.  Unfortunately, I can't handle much spice anymore so I had to go for all the mild options (although I did ask for ancho sauce). I had to wait close to 20 minutes for my food (not really Fast Food), and the waffles tasted slightly stale (I had to use my hands to eat the waffles because I could not split them with utensils). The chicken on the other hand was slightly better; it seemed air fried since there was no observable oil stains (very good!).  In due fairness, when discussing this restaurant with some friends, they said that the spicy options really enhanced the flavour and they personally enjoyed the experience. So perhaps this meal was supposed to target that sort of audience - and my experience may have been an outlier.   At best I would give this place 3 stars. Many restaurants can get away with possessing flavour through the alias of strong spice; however, for people that can't handle it, it's generally a poor experience. Likewise, the wait time was again just too much, especially when the restaurant is not even busy."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken. Delicious waffles. Perfectly crispy and extremely flavorful! The place was immacutely clean."}
{"text":"Deliciously seasoned chicken - moist, not too oily and the perfect amount of crisp! Very different from Popeyes or other fried chicken spots. Looks similar to KFC fried chicken but a lot more tasty.   Ordered the \"Hey Rooster\" with 2 piece chicken and waffle. Waffle is ok - basic recipe I could make at home. Looking forward to trying their jalapeño/cheddar waffle or their \"Rooster Eh!\""}
{"text":"Ordered the waffle sandwich with onion rings, I don't know exactly what is in their sauce but it is delicious.  Will definitely return again to sample some of their other menu options."}
