{"text":"By far one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh! The chefs and owners are incredible! The food is amazing and the staff are friendly. The drinks are superb and the menu unique while being delicious. Chef Justin is very friendly and created an exquisite menu. Cheers to another great addition to Pittsburgh. Wonderful date night away from the baby."}
{"text":"Morcilla is for a bit more particular appetite. You need to be into sausages and meat to really get a good experience here. Your waiter will do an excellent job of getting you through the menu and finding things you want to try but, I would never guarantee anyone that they will like it here. I ordered the potato chips, octopus, and their variety sausages. I thought everything was good but don't see myself going back due to the price and particular menu. I've heard people rave about their sangria and thought it was terrible."}
{"text":"Wonderful and big menu. Had the chorizo, lamb meatballs, potatoes, baby back ribs. Also the gazpacho was fantastic. Nice wine list and good bartender. Definite recommend."}
{"text":"Not the place for a vegetarian!!  \"All the Meats\" plate is as good as it gets - a true indulgence.  Had five small plates and not a single taste was below five stars.   Asked for a second helping of the pigs feet croquettes.  Bar space is open seating but get reservations and take time to revel in the happiness of your belly."}
{"text":"So worth the hype.  I made reservations for my husband and I weeks in advance for a Friday night.  We arrived a little early and got a drink at the bar until our table was ready.  Once seated, our server greeted us and took great care of us throughout the night.  I told him that I was a pescatarian and he marked up a menu showing me all the things I could have - this was such a great help and made dining that much easier.  The food was phenomenal, we ordered a little bit of everything -  my husband loved the Morcilla Sausage, and I couldn't get over the Bacalao (I could have liked the honey side sauce dish clean).  We also enjoyed Patatas Bravas, Totilla Espanola, and the Churro.   And honestly, our night would not have been complete without the Crema Catalana dessert - a frozen, crispy creme brule that was to die for!!!!  Overall, service, food, wine, ambiance was all great and I am already making my next reservation!"}
{"text":"If you don't dine at Morcilla, you're missing out on a great place! Our dinner was delicious and Michael, our bartender made our dining experience perfect. We had a great seat at the bar and received excellent attention and service by all. As a vegetarian I enjoyed the brussel sprouts and butter lettuce salad. My boyfriend also thought the brussel sprouts were delicious, however he said the ribs were fabulous! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great place to spend a night with friends enjoying good drinks and good food. The small plates are a fun way to snack on better-than-authentic Spanish foods. The flavor combinations can only be described as incredible. I particularly enjoyed the Morcilla Sausage and the Pato Escabeche (duck leg)."}
{"text":"I love Morcilla! My favorites are the chorizo, duck croquette, oxtail, and manchego and orange (queso en aceite). They are all so incredibly flavorful, the manchego an unsuspecting favorite. The only thing I haven't really loved is the pork belly. I love their sangrias, which are not too sweet like a lot of sangria is. Also have only ever had great waitresses/waiters here. The crazy thing is how affordable this place is compared to many other restaurants where the food just is not good. The restaurant is pretty small, so a large group may have trouble getting a reservation unless you make it quite far ahead."}
{"text":"We had:  Lamb meatballs - not bad but not great  Foie Gras - excellent, but really small (one baguette slice spread with foie gras)  Crab butter and tarragon churro - awesome  Chorizo - good but simple (as in I'd make that at home next time with parma's chorizo)  Morcilla - ok, soft and loose texture that I didn't expect  Conchinillo - inedible  Red sangria - different, not bad  Syrah Rose on tap - meh  We were disappointed in our meal at Morcilla.  The service was well paced; we finished dinner in a reasonable amount of time, though there were spurts and lags, but this is expected in a tapas restaurant.  The seating was extra uncomfortable; we must be getting old because sitting on a hard seat with no padding for 2 hours really started to bother us.  The cocktails disappointed, and the food varied in quality from excellent to inedible.  Unfortunately, the excellent small plate (crab butter and tarragon churro) was quickly forgotten when our $45 platter (conchinillo) intended for 2 people proved to be inedible.   The quarter sized medallions of meat at the end of each chop were quite tasty, but you literally couldn't chew the rest of it.  The 'crispy skin' had obviously been recooked, leaving the skin so hard that you were afraid you would crack a tooth on it, so no yummy fried skin for us (a tragedy).  The fact that they hadn't cooked it slowly enough to break down the tough tissue meant you missed out on all those bites that blur the lines between meat and fat; oh yeah, it also meant that your double sized entrée consisted of...5 bites of meat!?  The 3 sauces served with it were ok - the salsa verde had tarragon in it, which I love, elevating it to excellent.  The rustic bread was darkly toasted, which wouldn't have been a problem if the rest of the dish wasn't so hard to chew, but we had no energy left in our jaws.  When the server came by to ask how it was, we responded 'it's really tough'.  She nodded, replying, 'it's tough?' (to which we nodded vigorously), and she walked away never to mention it again.  Thanks for caring...    There was nothing on the cocktail list that called to us, and we weren't impressed with the sangria or the wine we had, so we didn't order more drinks, which kept our check down to $110.  Unfortunately, despite ordering slightly more than typically recommended (based on our double sized entrée), I had to pull out the snacks as soon as we got home.   Ok, the conchinillo...I want to be fair...I'm sure this dish would be extremely difficult to cook, particularly in a restaurant setting.  Honestly, I don't know what they were going for; Severino is a butcher and a chef, so I'm really confused.  I believe this was basically 1/3 of a suckling crown roast, except with the full rib attached, grilled and cut into chops.  I've never heard of cooking a suckling pig hard and fast - way too much collagen, etc.  (though I am no chef and don't get much suckling pig, so what do I know?)  Maybe the chef tried to jump the shark on this one, but why does it stay on the menu?   The only reasonable conclusion I can make (because incompetence doesn't seem reasonable) is that I'm an idiot and totally misunderstood, that they really only intended you to eat the tenderloin/ribeye medallions (and maybe that's all that's edible for a suckling pig, I mean really, how often do you eat suckling pig?).  But that isn't enough for 1 person, much less 2, and what about the ribs (waste the ribs? really?? Is this true?).  And that does not excuse the skin; let's not forget that they ruined the skin.  Maybe our server misunderstood what was actually edible on the plate when describing the size of the dish.  Maybe we got the tail end of the pig, making those bites pitifully small.  Regardless, this was a total waste, and I'm talking about the animal, not my money (though that was sad too).  Even I, the unrepentant foie gras eater, lamented the little piggy that gave his life for 5 bites of meat."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best meal I've ever eaten. Delicious. Tried maybe 8 different things off the menu. All fantastic. All impeccably crafted and balanced. You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"First visit here. For two, we had the pintxos: oysters escabeche (very tasty); montaditos: beef tartare (interesting with the vegetable escabeche), foie gras (tasty), oxtail (savory / comforting and wanted more); croquetas: pig feet and cheeks (tasty, the pickled greens were interesting); plates: pulpo (the cilantro jus was curiously good, octopus tender), bacalao (salt cod - well prepared but maybe overwhelmed by the capers), and the lamb en moreno (the winner out of the small plates - the sumac yogurt fit remarkably well with the lamb). Shared a platter of the costillas de la matanza (killer ribs... pomegranate sherry caramel & coriander glaze) - which were perfectly fall off the bone tender & delicious.   Atmosphere was very laid back & comfortable, wait staff was attentive, service was well timed. With what we ordered we left satisfyingly full & not stuffed (the right ammount of food).  Having been to Cure several times, I had possibly unreasonable expectations that every dish would blow me away and leave me drooling for more - and as such this seemed hit or miss.  Full house, the kitchen was orderly and did not appear to be backed up or in a rush. Compliments to them.  Overall - the oysters, foie gras, oxtail, lamb meatballs, and the ribs were excellent.   My only complaint has nothing to do with the food. The flat sink in the restroom is ridiculously not utilitarian for something that's going to be used 150 times per night by buzzed patrons. But don't let that stop you from visiting, just go easy on the faucet at first :)"}
{"text":"Walked in to Morcilla on a weeknight with no reservation and were able to sit at the bar. The place is VERY VERY BUSY, and small. But wonderful vibe and decor.  You will probably need help interpreting the menu, but that's okay, because the staff seems extremely knowledgeable. Speaking of staff, Morcilla has plenty of it. There were SO many people working when we went - it was amusing. But made for good service.  The food is very good. It is mostly small plates. There are bigger plates I believe, but overall, I would say don't expect to come here for a real dinner. Definitely a pricey, pre-dinner snack. The drinks are great - as is typical of Lawrenceville, very cool cocktails.   We got a variety of things - wings, oxtail, corn on the cob and a few others - it was all very good. I really couldn't complain about anything. It is a bit of a complex menu if you aren't a total foodie.    Two drinks and 4 or 5 small plates brought us a bill of about $100. If you enjoy good, interesting food, Morcilla is it."}
{"text":"One of the most memorable meals I've had in Pittsburgh. The oxtail tapas cannot be recommended highly enough. I ordered them twice in one meal. The Sangria wasn't too sweet and the Churros were delectable. Make a reservation because there's a well-deserved line at the door for dinner."}
{"text":"Our company gave us a gift card to use at any restaurant, so we chose morcillas. Since we had a high budget, we got a wide range of options. The food was good, but not overly impressive. All the cured meats had a similar sweet flavor that must be unique to the restaurant. The foie Blanc was pretty good. The duck was almost very good but it seemed like something was lacking. The jamon croquettes seemed like they were trying to revamp the Dutch croquettes/bitterballens but the breading/shell was very strange and I didn't like it at all.   Atmosphere was really nice. The waiters and staff were all super friendly. Definitely worth trying but not sure if I would go back again."}
{"text":"Unbelievable.  So good it brings you to tears.  Everything is perfect without exception.  From start to finish, you will not be disappointed.  You can feel the love in every dish.  You must try the Manchego with blood orange and olive oil, charcuterie platter, baby back ribs, crema catalana.  Just fantastic.  Don't miss it"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere.  Would definitely go back.  I also really liked how easy it was to book a reservation online."}
{"text":"That's just about it.  It's good at everything.  Food and drink are impeccable.  My only gripe I can come up with is they rarely open their front bar window, which in nice weather would make the place a little 'cooler.'  But that's it!"}
{"text":"Severino and co are at the forefront of the Pittsburgh foodie/restaurant scene.  It doesn't get much better than this in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My husband liked (but did not love) Morcilla.  I found their kitchen a bit too devoted to using vegetables as a garnish on a half cup of butter.  Yeah, the main dish was the melted butter, and the veggies were the garnish.   They cheaped out on the mariscos by filling it out with chick peas.  At least they didn't call it paella.  (It was also on the upper end of too salty.)  The butter and oil totally overwhelmed the more subtle taste of the vegetables and seafood.  I do not object to fat per se, but Morcilla's kitchen was just using it as a crutch for sparse or common ingredients.  The ambience was nice, but really, anybody can melt a stick of butter on a vegetable and heap cheese and aioli on top.   How about some finesse instead of hammering us with GREASE?"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great service. Very unique. I would recommend trying! We had many small plates and drinks all of which were great! The staff is very knowledgeable and will help you navigate the menu."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in town now! Called ahead the same night on a Thursday and were seated pretty quickly. The place seems very well run - cozy but not chaotic. Had a table of three and ordered maybe 8 or 9 items from the menu, everything was delicious. I'm not normally a super adventurous eater, but there wasn't a single thing I wouldn't order again. Fresh cocktails, and very knowledgable and helpful staff for overwhelmed newbies. Just a few of our favorites were the salt cod croquetas, chorizo, and duck with grapefruit. Really impressed, and glad to have this restaurant in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here this past Friday for dinner and it was a great experience.  We made reservations for 6 PM, got there about 10 minutes early and were seated right away.   Our server was attentive, prompt and conscientious. At her recommendation, I tried the Spanish Martini which was really good - not overpowering whatsoever. My wife had the sangria which was also good,  tasting subtly of star anise if you're into that.  As for the meal itself, we enjoyed all of our selections thoroughly and had no complaints. We tried the blood sausage and oxtail (montaditos), the goat cheese croquettes, duck leg (plate) and the rib platter. While small, the duck was cooked perfectly and fell right off the bone. The ribs were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender and flavorful on the inside. By the end of dinner we were both comfortably full.  To avoid a potential complaint of waiting a long time between courses, I'd suggest knowing what you would like to try ahead of time and ordering it all at once as opposed ordering a couple items at a time. We picked out our courses the night before, ordered them at the beginning and the pace of our meal was just right. Also, to avoid the potential pitfall of small-plate post-meal hunger, picking a platter and 4 other items was just right for 2 people.j"}
{"text":"Went here last week for hubby's birthday. Loved it!  The menu is weird and I didn't understand it at all until it was explained to us. Each thing you order is tiny, and meant to be shared. You're supposed to order a bunch of things. I think me and my husband ordered 7 or 8 dishes. It's brought out to you as it's ready so you can have no food in front of you or like 3 or 4 dishes. Two things you must must must get are the oxtail and the jamon.  So tasty. I also had a glass of their homemade sangria with red wine and didn't like it. Something in there was REALLY strong. I'm not a drinker at all(I expect a glass of sangria to be sweet and fruity.).  I felt buzzed after about 3 sips of this. It just wasn't my taste but apparently it's a super popular drink there. Anyway, I would most definitely go here again."}
{"text":"A group of three of us ordered the \"all the meats\" tray, however, not all of the meats that were listed on the menu are included, which the server neglected to tell us. So if you are looking for a particular meat to be on the all the meats tray-ask before you order. Our server didn't take any time to explain the dishes or how much of each you receive. It would be nice if the shrimp dish would state that you receive on shrimp only! The gin and tonic drinks were the best part of this place. So refreshing and so many to choose from. The Mahon Gin is worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype! I was skeptical going in because we have heard so many great reviews, yet the food and service exceeded expectations. We went on a couple date and started with the All The Meats (it's a perfect way to try all of the house made meats and small cold appetizers). Each meat was unique and delicious a you could even taste the chamomile in the homemade salami. The olives melted in your mouth and the lavender almonds were surprisingly delicious (who would think to put lavender on almonds). We also tried the tortilla española (which was my least favorite dish), the shrimp and ribs. The brussel sprouts with smoked goat cheese were some of the best I've tasted. And the service was wonderful and thorough!"}
{"text":"Excellent food but probably not as good as Cure.  Great Drinks including the sangria."}
{"text":"Price to portions is not equal.  Sure this place has good food, but so do tons of restaurants in Pittsburgh. Don't believe the hype and go somewhere else where you can get your dollars worth and not feel looked down upon by the elitist setting."}
{"text":"I went here for nye. Great service from the staff. Liked the Gin menu. Nice atmosphere. Table for 4...we love sharing...so we tried several things. Some of the dishes fell short. There were of course some good ones though. It was a 50/50 toss up of good/needs work. But for the price, we were hoping for a higher winning percentage. We will come back in a few months after things are a bit more solid.  Good: BACALAO EN ACEITE; my husband ate a lot of this growing up with Mediterranean food. He thought this was done well. CHORIZO; excelente. OXTAIL; rich and tasty. PULPO; the octopus was cook perfectly. Not a pencil eraser rubber. PATO ESCABECHE; this was a smoky flavored duck that resembled pork (although I would have rather had the duck flavor not be overpowered by the smoke). The fruit it was paired with was marvelous.   Not my style....could be yours: CRAB BUTTER AND TARRAGON CHURRO; definitely for sharing with more than 2 people. Too rich by itself. 2-3 bites and everyone couldn't do anymore. PIGS FEET AND CHEEKS; 1 from my table liked it, I was indifferent. Wasn't bad, but didn't wow me. Was like an egg roll. LAMB EN MORENO; a bit gristley.  Missed the mark for everyone: SPIDER CRAB DEVILED EGG; I love deviled eggs. They are meant to be a vehicle of flavor. These were surprisingly bland. QUESO DE CABRA; something about the overly smokey cheese & spiced quince that combined to have a plastic flavor. This was the whole tables least favorite item."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic, northern Spain tapas joint, this is it! All of the croquetas are flavorful with great sauces! The lomo sandwich was delicious!  The churros are good not great but the chocolate is not great but fantastic! I ate it with a spoon! The red sangria is proper and perfect!"}
{"text":"First time visit and it was truly amazing. Every single plate was wonderful. Great service as well. We will definitely be back and will spread the word. Awesome addition to the Pittsburgh food scene."}
{"text":"Top five meals of my life. Hands down.  Based on reviews and word of mouth, my husband and I chose Morcilla to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. It was difficult to get a later dinner reservation, but we were very pleased with a 4:15 seating. Upon arrival the restaurant was rather quiet (this changed as our visit continued which was the only draw back for me). To start, my husband had a beer and I had a Gin & Tonic with one of the lovely gins Morcilla offers. I loved the presentation of my drink with fruit, rosemary, and star anise! As for food, we tried the oxtail, chorizo, sobrasada, and the pigs feet and cheek croqueta. All of which were fantastic, but for me the sobrasada and oxtail were the home runs. Tip: if you're sharing, order two oxtail. You're really not going to want to share. Finally, we ordered two plates: the Cordero en Moreno (lamb meatballs) and the Pulpo Escabeche (octopus). Both were perfection. The octopus was tender and delicious, and the meatballs were unique and fantastic. Aside from the increasing noise level as our visit wore on, were beyond pleased with our visit to Morcilla. Remember this is a tapas and small plates restaurant- you're not going to find a huge entree here. With that said, we spent $88 on three alcoholic beverages, after dinner espresso, and enough food that we certainly didn't leave hungry. To me, that's a pretty fair price for a restaurant at this level!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, the first time I went to Morcilla I don't remember being impressed so my boyfriend and I decided to give it another shot. Maybe I'd had too much to drink the first visit, but the second time back I only have good things to say about it! We went in around 5 on a Saturday and got seats at the bar with plans to just have a few drinks and maybe a snack. Of course you can't read the menu and only get one dish, so we ended up ordering quite a few and making it dinner.   Everything we ordered was amazing. Serrano ham is so simple but just well done. The tuna crudo we got with peaches was a great combination of flavors as was the anchovy/tomato toast and the artic char a la plancha. However - the unexpected standout was the pistachio-grape-cucumber gazpacho that was on the menu. Seriously - unreal! It had a black garlic oil and some crunchy pistachios and grape halves and ... yum. The boyfriend and I both agreed this might have been one of our all-time favorite dishes.  Overall - great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. Definitely a favorite in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE. I randomly decided to go to Pittsburgh while on a roadtrip and wandered into Morcilla. As I was alone, I grabbed a seat at the bar thinking I'd just get a quick drink and dessert then head back to my AirBnB. I ended up hanging out for about 3 hours. People at the bar were super friendly and I got to watch the waitstaff slice charcuterie - which looked amazing. Also, one of the awesome bartenders, upon finding out I was new to town, gave me a list of food suggestions and fun things to do while in Pittsburgh. Cocktails were interesting and their sangria was perfect for an unusually hot spring day. For dessert, I ordered the churros which came with a chocolate hazlenut sauce - YUMMMMMMM. Will have to get a full meal at Morcilla on my next Pittsburgh trip!"}
{"text":"For someone who lived in Spain for three years, walking into Morcilla felt like going back in time, to a happier and ham'ier place. From the decor and expertise of the staff, to the hams hanging from the ceiling and the lively, social brightness, I felt at home. Friend and I sat at the bar, as there was no unreserved or untaken spots in the back, and did not regret it. The olives were tasty and fresh, the croquetas were hot and delicious, the jamón serrano was perfectly sliced and topped with delicious, crunchy almonds. We ordered tortilla española, as well, which was too cold for my liking, as it should be cool, or room temp, but not straight-out-of-the-fridge cold. For the main dish we shared pork belly a la plancha, incredible! Crispy, salty, porky perfection. Everything was beyond my expectations, and then we decided to just go for it, and get dessert. Un café cortado y.. Crema Catalana.. does that sound good? Seriously the best dessert I've had, this side of the Atlantic or the other. It is pricey, especially for small dishes of tapas that often come for free in Spain, but if you are looking to try something new, or have a craving for something Iberian, it is 100% worth the price."}
{"text":"Wtf? The hype got to their heads, because the obnoxious service got even more awful.  We made a reservation and were kept cooling our heels for an HOUR.  Hey. This is PITTSBURGH, friend.  It's Pittsburgh. At the end of the day, you're still in a third rate town. Lose the attitude.  The food was mediocre.  What a waste."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love! Takes tapas to a new high level with exquisite large dishes as well - best mackerel will take you by surprise. Wonderful and informed wait staff and management. One of top choices for me"}
{"text":"The best Sunday brunch in Pittsburgh. Great drinks, and amazing cured meat. Oxtail is the best thing in the menu. Get the eggs Benedict for brunch."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner with a friend here. Food was very good. We sampled several dishes."}
{"text":"Severino deserves a James Beard! This guy is cooking extraordinary food in two wonderful venues! America needs more restaurants like Morcilla!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Glorious bevs. What more could you want? For a little celebration my boo thang & I decided to finally try this place. We called day of (Thursday) and couldn't make a reservation so we stopped in and were lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar (which is a little tight but I have short legs so it's cool)  If it's your first time I actually recommend sitting here because as a tapas place they try to have you order your food all at once if you are at a table, sitting at the bar is less hurried & gives you chance to order a plate or 2 & decide if you want more.  The staff was super knowledgeable & we especially loved the octopus, cabbage, Jamon iberico de bellota (\"worlds best ham\"). It's pricey but super worth it. Now Go! GO NOW!! See for yourself!"}
{"text":"It was our first time there and we were looking forward to a great meal however we were very disappointed.  If it's your preference, the facade of a trendy hipster restaurant is alive and well, however the menu is very limited and they missed the mark regarding the meal itself. In my opinion our meals were extremely overpriced for what was delivered.  The service was fine and the employees were polite.  I wish them the best of luck but I don't see us going back."}
{"text":"Morcilla is a great experience. Most of the plates are two bite-sized pieces of food. This isn't just small plates, it's really small plates!  The service was very good, attentive, had good recommendations on what and how to order.   The menu is confusing and you'll definitely need help to know how much and what to order. I think it's overwhelming and could be simplified.  The custom cocktails were good, but very small. I think it's odd for a drink to come from the bar only 1/2 or less filled. I had to order a half dozen drinks before I really felt satisfied. Price was high for what you received.   The food was mostly outstanding although half the time you are trying to remember which dish you are even trying.  The oxtail was delicious as was the savory cheesy churro.  Other reviews do a better job of describing the food here, and I won't try and top that. Besides we ordered probably 10 things, and keeping them all straight would have required a notebook.   Great experience, great food, great service. Cocktails are small. Plates are small. Bill is high. This is all the information you need. Enjoy.  Keith OUT."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and had read about this restaurant and its up and coming chef, so we dropped in for dinner. There wasn't a false note from the cocktails and sangria to the dessert. Service was friendly and mostly efficient - the usual frenzy of plates flying to and from the table in the small plate dining experience. Our server made great suggestions and we happily listened. The oxtail is a near out-of-body experience with its buttery texture and deep, beefy flavor. And the sweet/acidic summer goodness of the the Tomato & Peach salad was refreshing. The mushrooms are a meal in themselves - amazing. And the BBQ ribs were the absolute best I have ever eaten, hands down, in every way. They come off the bone clean, in meaty chunks, and then fell part in your mouth. Crispy outside/ tender and juicy inside without drowning in fat or sauce. What a great meal. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that out overall experience was great. A few things to note the pig feet and cheek was amazing. The hanger steak and the Morcilla sausage were a must have...Don't waste your money on the jamon ibrico is not worth the $25, it's no better than proscuitto. Also we ordered $80 worth of drinks and they still didn't comp out corkage fee. Overall as always Justin is amazing, but I think the service and pricing still need work."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner! Can't wait to come back.  The chicken was amazing!!!Thanks for a memorable evening."}
{"text":"We were only spending the weekend in Pittsburgh and settled on Morcilla. I had been arguing with myself about the $40 Iberico ham and ultimately decided to go for it. I made many good decisions that night, but that was the best. Served somewhere between room temperature and body temperature, the ham melted in your mouth. Delicious! We went on to try the champignons a la plancha, the beef crudo, and the bacala croquetas. All absolute winners. The lamb tagine was also delicious with rhubarb, lebneh, pistachios and golden raisins. We finished with churros which were fine (nothing spectacular here). Will definitely be back next time I visit."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a place like Morcilla's.  We sat at the bar for 3 hours and the entire experience was outstanding.    Started with three meats:  Chorizo, morcilla and something with apricots.  The experience was so unexpected and so darn delicious!  I had no idea charcuterie could taste like this.  Whammo!!!  We continued with Octopus which had fried chick peas, pickled cucumbers and mystery magicness, oxtail numminess, cucumber something that was only soso, beautifully charred ribs, smokey and sweet, raw tuna with peach or nectarine that was a flavor explosion.  Ended with peach sorbet made in Shadyside and churro with warm chocolate/fudge.  WOW!  Best meal I've had for a long time and so much fun!!!  Oh, I can't forget to tell you about their gin cocktails!!  Made with their own tonic and all sorts of botanicals, depending on the drink.  Mine had juniper berries, yellow mini marigold, rosemary. I also had their fabulous red sangria.    At the bar its like you're watching a cooking/mixologist show.  We were shocked that three hours had passed by.    Go."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday after trying to go to like 3 other places that were huge failures. The bartender was great. The drinks were delicious. My favorite tapas was the queso. It was the best value for the money. Huge bowl of cheese and olive oil and bread. You definitely will need extra bread tho, which is like $2. The fancy Spanish cider with the arm length pour is very interesting and if you ask they will explain it to you...it's super funky and delicious. Gin and tonic dedicated menu available and the gin selection is not to be f*cked with. They have the best selection in Pittsburgh by far! If you like gin and meats and cheese, you should definitely make this your next stop."}
{"text":"I've been to Morcilla for brunch twice in three weeks. It's that good. The first time was with friends and two infants. They weren't exactly prepared for the infants but we figured it out. Granted one carseat was on the floor and the other on the bench. But not horrible - it isn't a kid place. The service was excellent. Zack took time to explain the menu, give advice on how/what to order based on the party, and didn't rush us through our meal. He didn't just say \"everything on the menu is good.\"  He gave recommendations about tapas after he saw what we liked as charcuterie. I had the oxtail toast the first time and the goat cheese and caramelized onion omelet the second time. Both were amazing. Dressing on the mixed greens with the omelet was fabulous. I could drink that stuff. Definitely try the chorizo with dates and bleu cheese. The flavors are amazing together. And lastly get the French press coffee. Go for the big pot because you are going to want more."}
{"text":"Fun tapas experience in a cool little spot on Butler Street.  Cure is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh, and even though Morcilla is from the same team, I probably should have tempered my expectations given that Morcilla is a completely different dining experience than your typical sit down meal.   Everything was good, don't get me wrong, but none of the plates (which looked beautiful by the way) were out of this world amazing.    Definitely an ambitious restaurant (for Pittsburgh) that I appreciate and am happy to see is doing well.  Even though I wasn't too high on any of the plates, I know how talented Chef Severino and his team are, and I 100%  plan on visiting again."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant true to the Spanish tradition of small plates, delicious meats and mains that are as good as those found in Spain. Service is professional and informative, the drinks and wines outstanding. We are so happy Morcilla choose pittsburgh as its home. it would be successful in markets like New York and Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Lived and Ate in Pittsburgh for the past 4 years. Morcilla, in my opinion, is the best enjoyment to price ratio out of all of the \"finer\" dining joints in the city. Great drinks, even better food, at a an extremely fair price."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and drinks!  Best meal I've had in Pittsburgh.  The foie gras, goat cheese croquettes and chorizo were amazing.  I had the hangar steak, which was also excellent.  The true star of the evening was the smoked ribs.  They were incredible!  I don't think any entree could top them.  The churros and dark chocolate dipping sauce was the perfect ending to a phenomenal meal.  I also loved the decor, especially the gravity defying sink in the bathrooms."}
{"text":"I'm going to precursor this review with the fact that as a 'newbie' to Pittsburgh, I have found most of my dining experiences sub par to any other place I have lived/visited. The Pittsburgh food scene likes to present itself as the next up and coming place but, so far, Morcilla has been the ONLY restaurant in Pittsburgh that has delivered a meal that I felt I paid a fair price for and received the exceptional quality, service, and ambiance that coincides with the pricing.   First of all, we had to make reservations weeks in advance - I don't view that as an accolade of any type, but now I can at minimum respect why we waited for 3 weeks for a table. This place gets PACKED and based on dining style it makes sense. You absolutely need time to luxuriate and enjoy each bite and sip of food and drink in front of you - so tables are occupied by the same parties for hours (we were there for at least 3 hours).  Second of all, our server (Sarah) was awesome - we had all hit hungry to the point that we wanted to order everything off the menu, she helped us reel ourselves in with exceptional advice and tips on her favorite dishes. She was super patient with us while we floundered through their salivating menu (seriously, I could order all the jamon and call it a day).   We ordered a bunch of food to share: almonds, beef tartar, mushrooms, croquetas de jamon, chicken wings, patatas bravas, the Cecina dried beef, and Churros in hazelnut chocolate sauce. Food wise - we were in HEAVEN. The meat melted in your mouth and the chicken wings fell right off the bone (I've never had a better chicken wing in my life). The mushrooms & patatas bravas were both absolutely delicious, there was a unique egg situation on top of the mushrooms that formed this delicious sauce, that just tied everything together so incredibly well. We finished off the delicious food with perfectly fried churros and a hazelnut chocolate sauce you'd want to take home and bathe in. Of  course we tied this all in with a delicious bottle of Tempranillo and topped the night off with rather alcoholic, but super smooth G&Ts.   My only issue with this spot is that I spent 3ish hours sitting in a rather uncomfortable chair (those could use an upgrade), but that still cannot detract me from saying I'd absolutely go back and sit in that chair for 3+ more hours to enjoy this spot as frequently as possible.   Thanks for the awesome experience, Morcilla!"}
{"text":"Being in the company of a few others allowed us to really work our way around their terrific menu. The house-made charcuterie is excellent, as was pretty much all of what we ate. Highlights included the morcilla sausage (over the chorizo) which was rich and intense in flavour, the fluke contrasted well being delicate yet standing up, and as a discerning octopus aficionado, I'm happy to report it was a really enjoyable plate. The monkfish took my \"best in show\" award."}
{"text":"I loved this place! The service was impeccable - new utensils after every course, crumbs cleaned from table, we were never rushed, food was paced perfectly. Our waiter was Zach and he was wonderful! He knew every answer to our questions, presented the menu well and also took a photo for us. My favorites - the oxtail, the bacalao croquettes and the ribs.  THE RIBS! Can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Overall masterpiece. Ordered the brandade de bacalao montadito to start, unbelievable in taste and the slight hint of lemon at the end is perfect. The Chorizo was perfect, a counter to the date and \"blue cheese\" as well as the serrano ham being a perfect funk balance to the almonds. The octopus was beyond tender with an enough snap to break the texture and finally the 18oz steak was to die for. Lain over a bed of smashed potatoes with caramelized shallot and it was one of the best pieces of meat you could get in the city. Last (and for all) the Crema Calatalana desert was a perfect way to end the night here. Our sever, Clara, really made our experience here beyond amazing. She was friendly, down to earth, and willing to answer any questions that we had, as well as give excellent recommendations. This is a highly sought after gem of Pittsburgh in my book and I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with a group of 4 for dinner, and it was a fantastic experience!   For a group of 4 we had reservations at 8 and were seated right away, A little after ordering drinks, my friend and I realized we were sitting right under an AC vent and it was a little chilly. The staff was super accommodating in allowing us to switch tables and keep our server, who was awesome by the way!  Cocktails were delightful! I started with the Palabra Amarilla, a mezcal & chartreuse drink that was much easier to drink than it sounds. Major points to the bartenders behind the cocktail program because we were continually satisfied. The Old Havana, with a smoked ice cube, was another awesome cocktail. The Vermut con Refresco was another group favorite, sweet vermouth + gin and saffron. Dangerously good.  We started with the \"All of the Meats\" platter of charcuterie, which some might say is a little steep at $60, but for the amount of awesome meats you get and the variety presented, it's definitely well worth it.   The meal itself is more tapas-style, so we ordered around 2-3 plates per person. We were blown away by the dishes as well! To start, the manchego cheese dressed with olive oil & served with the baguettes was incredible. The flavor packed into the little cheese bites (and the charcuterie) was just priming us for the rest of a delightful meal to follow.   Of the tapas, our group's favorites included: octopus a la plancha, brandade de bacalao, arctic char a la plancha, morcilla sausage, napa cabbage a la plancha, & pork belly and peaches a la plancha. Every dish was composed E X P E R T L Y. The octopus was cooked perfectly, tender and snapped into nice, not chewy bites. The bacalao has a saltiness that lended it well to spreading across the crostinis that were given. Arctic char's cherry tomato sauce & sweet garlic complemented each other beautifully, and the sprouts on top only elevated the dish. The sausage was phenomenally crafted, as the entire dish truly complemented itself. Between the braised greens, toasted nuts, fresh cilantro, and the flavors in the sausage itself, it was wildly good.   We finished by ordering all three desserts featured, the churros, crema catalana (like creme brulee), and the peach sorbet. If you don't have the kind of appetite we did, definitely get the churros! They're nice and hot, with a chocolate hazelnut sauce, and it's great way to finish up your meal.  Big shout-out to our server Dave! He was super attentive and on top of everything we needed! Don't be fooled if your server appears to be somewhat casually dressed, because their service is anything but. He was on top of coursing our meal out for us, and clearing the table and also cleaning between courses, and always did so with a friendly and efficient manner. We never felt that we were waiting long for a single thing, it was a service experience I'll definitely remember! Even when we were having desserts and my friend dropped his fork, he had a clean one before he even had a chance to pick up the other off the ground. That's how great our service was!  Morcilla is on top of everything. Definitely stop in if you haven't done so already. We will certainly be back (I made a yelp account just so I could tell them how great they are)"}
{"text":"We eat out at least once or twice a week. We started going to Cure when it opened and have followed Justin and Nathan (I think he was 17, and very, very tall). We had no reservation on a Thursday at 7:30. So glad we arrived when we did, two other couples breezed in right after us. We got a bar seat which was amazing because we were inches from the charcuterie station, and to the right was the raw bar. From our height we could see into the kitchen as well. This place is a well-oiled machine. The staff have all been together for over a year. I talked to the GM, Raoul, and extended my compliments. He was humble, yet busy, and excused himself to go back to helping his team.   Food:. Incredible. We had All The Meats. And wine - we asked for suggestions for wine, tasted samples and chose.   There are at least three flavors to everything you eat. For example the marcona almonds that you eat have lavender sugar, sea salt and pepper; it's quite divine.  If you like to eat by choosing flavors from a bounty that is all within hands reach  - if you like tasting fennel pollen, rendered fat from dry-aged meats (I asked Nathan what he did with the Iberico Jambon when he cut it to make a plate for a guest), and smoked ice with your drink, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are excellent, decor is interesting and homey (and doesn't feel like every other exposed brick hipster place -- it actually reminded me of places I went in Seville), servers are knowledgeable and helpful/candid. Great meal!"}
{"text":"Chef Nathan had me at first bite!  Great dishes, unique flavors.  Where does Chef Justin comes up with these amazing creations!  Love being back in the burgh!  I can't believe that I didn't take a picture of the artichoke.  The best I've ever had!  That speaks volumes since I lived in the artichoke Capitol of the country!"}
{"text":"5 stars.  This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, in my humble opinion.  *Disclaimer*  I studied Spanish in college, have been to Spain twice, and likely have a nostalgia for that culture and food that really hits me in the feels.  Regardless, I was recently at a tapas bar/restaurant in DC that didn't even come close to Morcilla.  Where to start?  The beauty of a tapas style restaurant is that the portions are small and offer a perfect couple of bites between two people, so you can really start anywhere and circle around the menu to your heart's content.  Although if you had to ask me, I'd say you should start at the oxtail and blood sausage.  After you've kick started your senses, meander around to the restaurant's take on Spanish tortilla and choose some sort of oily fish to cleanse your palate.  Finally, bask in all the glory of España and savor some jamon Iberico along with a sherry (or several).  I'll be at the bar, and you can buy me a drink for detailing the best way to eat, at the best restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience here.  The food was tremendous, great portions for a great price.  The service was wonderful, they didn't rush us at all.  We spent about 2 hours taking our time tasting different items.  Everything was very good, although I was not a fan of the crab chorizo, it sounded interesting, but didn't hit the mark.  It could have been that I was just stuffed with everything else we consumed.  We started with two gin and tonics (they make their own tonic).  The we had some of the Charcuterie, as must if you go here.  Although, the menu has a lot of meat and fish, there are items for vegetarians (which my gf is) to eat.  The ambiance is very nice also.  Our meal was under $100 for two drink, the below food items and two espressos.  Very, very affordable.    We had the following: MARINATED OLIVES  LOMO  MORCILLA ACHORIZADA SALCHICHON  MATRIMONIO OXTAIL PIGS FEET AND CHEEK CHAMPIÑONES A LA PLANCHA TORTILLA ESPAÑOLA CHURRO DE CANGREJO Y ESTRAGON"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in a long time.  As a cook myself, I appreciate creativity in combining various flavors in a dish, and Morcilla does this expertly.  The ingredients were combined into an intoxicating fusion of flavor.  Everything we had was great, but I'd say the chorizo, the trout, and the ribs were our favorites.  Our waitress was super friendly and spent a good deal of time with us covering the menu and recommendations; she also gave us written recommendations of things to do in town.  They are gluten-conscious, and our waitress was very helpful in choosing GF menu items.     We happened to get a late seating on a Thursday night with a couple days notice, but I think weekends are booked out far in advance.  I so wish this restaurant was in my home town - it would be on our regular rotation.  We may have to travel to Pittsburgh again just to eat there!"}
{"text":"We are speechless!  The Octopus A La Plancha is out of this world. The Pork Belly A La Plancha comes with this amazing smoked potato fondue that will make you wish you have a whole bowl of this delight. The All of The Meats is the best meat platter we ever have. It is no wonder people are raving about this place."}
{"text":"Spent our annual girls weekend in Pittsburgh and was thrilled to be able to get reservations at Morcilla for lunch (dinner was booked Friday and Saturday night even though we called 5 days in advance).  The open air entrance to the bar called us in from the street and we were greeted by a friendly bartender before our party of six was seated by the kitchen. Our waiter (Beautiful Dave...there a lot of Daves apparently, but this guy is extremely easy on the eyes) expertly described the menu offerings and aging processes of the meats. He also carefully reviewed all of the vegetarian options for our friend. Hunky-ness aside, he was easily one of the best waiters we have ever had.  The bar offerings were wonderful, especially the Flor de Jarez. My friend swore that angels must have cried tears into it!  We ordered numerous plates for sharing, each one unique and delicious, especially the Puerto a la Plancha and Alcachofa a la Plancha.  Our only regret is that the kitchen activity was not viewable even though our seats were right next to it. We would have enjoyed watching the magic happen. Our dinner reservations will be made a month in advance for our next visit. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved Morcilla! I couldn't wait to try out this new spot and it certainly did not disappoint. We went with fellow foodie friends so we could enjoy a lot of the menu items and that we did! I started with the park guell cocktail and it was excellent. I also was able to try my friends rebujito that was also a fabulous choice.    Our server was extremely helpful in explaining the portion sizes for each item and when we needed to order more then one to split for the table. She was friendly and provided great recommendations. There honestly was not one dish that we didn't all love. It was such a fun dinner from beginning to end with each bite being better than the last. I would highly recommend any of the following dishes that we had.   From the Pintxos section we started with the Island Creek Oysters (excellent!), the Cecina which was the dried cured beef with cara cara oranghe (so delicious), Chistora, tiny chorizo wrapped in a potato chip (loved this!), crab butter churros (melt in your mouth) and the manchego cheese (one of my favorite cheeses so it was perfection!) From the Montadito's section we shared the beef tartare and the smoked spreadable salami. Both were excellent, especially surprising was the spreadable salami. The flavors combined with the hazelnut and dried apple were outstanding. From the plates we shared the lamb meatballs which some thought was the best dish of the night. They were excellent. And lastly, we shared the pollo platter. Again, this was also fantastic. The salsa verde was a perfect combination with the crispy chicken.    There were four of us and our server suggested ordering about 10-12 small dishes. Keep in mind this is tapas style so some of the Pintxos and Montadito's section are only a few bites. The platters are a bit larger, which as I mentioned, our server was excellent at guiding us through the menu so that we had the opportunity to try a lot of items. I only took a photo of my first beverage because after that we were enjoying every single bite so much. I definitely can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Mind blown. I've been wanting to come here since I heard about its opening and am soooo glad we were finally able to make it here.   We tried to make a same-day reservation and the website stated it was booked. Despite that, we called and were able to get a table. So I highly recommend calling even if the website says they're filled.   The concept here is small, shareable plates which is nice so you can order many plates to sample. The pricing doesn't appear to be that expensive but it can add up quickly. Their menu was a little difficult to interpret at first but once the server described the different sections, it was pretty simple. Basically, they have shaved dry meats, a selection of crostini, different croquettes, small plates and large plates.  We ordered somewhat of a feast so I won't list each item but each dish we tried was beautifully presented and had a complex array of flavors within each bite. My favorite was the Fois Gras which was savory, creamy and buttery, and sweet from the membrillo (a sweet jelly) placed on crunchy toasted bread. I feared my husband wouldn't like it but it turned out to be his favorite dish of the night as well.   This is a great place to go for a date night since everything is meant for sharing. The ambient lighting is also rather romantic. Overall, I loved the sophistication of the small bites and the flavors were out of this world."}
{"text":"I'm from out of state and a customer chose this restaurant for dinner. It. Was. Amazing! We ordered the pork belly, the oxtail, the tuna, the less intense version of the two specialty hams and the chorizo. We ended our meal with the frozen maple brûlée. Every dish was full of mouth-watering flavor and a delight to savor. The ambience is comfortable and cozy. Be sure to order a cocktail, they are mini works of art. If you like charcuterie style food, do NOT miss this restaurant! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service which we were not surprised about at all.  The most expensive item we ordered was a chorizo type of stew with fried egg. It was great and only $14.  Also really good house red wine on tap for $6 per glass. Will definitely be back to try some of the other items on the menu.  We ordered about 6 different items ranging in price from $5 to $14 and liked every one of them."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN one of the best tapas restaurants I've ever been to. Comparable to a restaurant in NYC, this restaurant did everything perfectly with its food and service. Their dishes were cooked perfectly and always had a special touch, like their Marcona almonds with lavender and manchego cheese with orange. Came here for a dinner with coworkers and ordered probably half the menu. I loved everything and I highly recommend their oxtail, pork cheek croquettes, Padron peppers,  and tuna crudo. I didn't think their dessert could do any better but their crema is probably the best I've ever had. It's basically a frozen creme brulee but it was warm on the outside and cold on the inside. I'm going to dream about that dessert. Our server was attentive and professional, handling our order well when we kept ordering more food while stuffing our faces with what was already on the table. Go to Morcilla."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  Everything was delicious, especially the charcuterie.  Waiter was very helpful in checking on ingredients.  Pigs feet/cheek croquette was easily best dish of the night, we ordered multiple times:)"}
{"text":"Sat at bar for business dinner and it was fantastic. Bar wasn't extensive in selections but it's a small place. Had the jamón con queso and it was divine. And I'm Latin so that's saying a lot. My second plate was the pork belly which was so good I almost thought about doubling up both orders. Would strongly recommend. With their humo y vino cocktail, glass of white wine and 2 apps came out to $50. Very affordable and very worth it. Will return when in in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Great staff, customer service (5/5) and great ambiance but the food was just OK. Portions were small, prices were high and the $10 chorizo platter was just cold cut chorizo with nothing else. For $10 I can pick up my own cold cut chorizo and cut it at home.   Disappointing."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh before they shut down. They have been closed for a few months after a pipe bursted on the floor above them, but reopened a week ago. I noticed a couple changes to the menu that disappointed me on our first time back. The one blaring change was the switch from Spanish menu options like \"pinxtos\" to small plates. They also removed the \"montaditos\" options which was one of my favorite courses. The main thing that drew me too this restaurant initially was the feeling of being immersed Basque culture. However, like other restaurants, they \"dumb\" down their menus to appease the masses. I really thought Justin Severino was above that but I guess no one is immune. The food is still excellently prepared and service is impeccable. We were even given a complementary glass of wine while the bottle we ordered was chilling. Morcilla offers an incredible selection of Sherry's and wine. I am just distraught to see one of my favorite restaurants back slide."}
{"text":"Catalan placa food all dressed up.  The food was tasty but the drinks were the best part in my opinion.  Portions (even though they are tapas and meant to be small) were laughably small on a few occasions. Restaurant acoustics made for an overwhelmingly loud dining experience.  I felt like it was trying a little too hard to be hip."}
{"text":"This place is just terrific. The food we had was unique and amazing. We had salmon, octopus, salad, patatas and wine. Every dish was well blended with different ingredients and tasted delicious. Also the waiter was super nice and friendly. Such a great experience."}
{"text":"Great addition to Pittsburgh.  We ordered ox tail, octopus, potatoes bravas, shishito peppers & ribs---everything was great. The atmosphere is cool too and service was fine.  Will definitely return"}
{"text":"Interesting bar concept, great appetizers/small eats and drinks! All you need is the bar area :) This old mayor's office turned restaurant is a fun place to check out with friends if you are just looking for a couple drinks and some fun appetizers! After being there twice just at the bar area, we finally got seated for an actual meal the third time. Although after eating a sit down meal, I have to say the best part about the restaurant is the small plates and the drinks! No need to get seats for that! Anything they have on the display case at the front of the restaurant is worth trying (anywhere from foie gras to ox tail)! I was not disappointed. The drinks they serve are also pretty fun to try! If you are willing to pay, try their Jamon Iberico Bellota appetizer. It's an interesting pairing of almond and the cured meat. As for main entree, we tried the grilled octopus (Pulpo). It was pretty good, but maybe not the best ever. The lamb meatballs (Cordero en Moreno) was definitely something worth trying if you like lamb. Lastly the artichoke was more of a one time interesting dish to try. After peeling layers of it, we finally got to the edible part, but there wasn't much left to eat haha. Overall, would recommend anyone to try the small plates and just stand around the bar and order fun drinks!"}
{"text":"I've now been 3 times and every time it has only gotten better. Does not disappoint, every dish was delicious. I recommend ordering a few from each section of the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, but very high prices and small portions... Two of us ate with two drinks spent $85 and left a little hungry... I did not hate my time there but I could not see myself going back"}
{"text":"So. Friggin. Good. One of the best foodie experiences in Pittsburgh and in my top 5 restaurants in town. I've been twice and made a point of trying lots of different things. The dishes are consistently interesting with complex flavors. Drinks are great and they even have my very favorite gin (Citadelle), which I've never seen in PA."}
{"text":"Excellent new addition to the neighborhood. Went with my husband on a Sunday night. I am glad we had a reservation because the place was busy. The concept is well conceived. The ambience is intimate yet lively. The waiters are knowledgeable and friendly, but not intrusive. We ordered about 9 tapas- 6 smaller bites and 3 plates. It was the perfect amount of food. We left satisfied but not stuffed. All of the tapas were very good- standouts were  the chorizo pintox, beef tartare montadito, and  pig feet and cheeks croqueta.   I give this place 4 not 5 stars because some of the tapas, while good, fell a little short- particularly the artichoke and the butter lettuce salad. Don't get me wrong, my husband and I cleaned our plates, but in comparison to some of the other tapas these just weren't as good or interesting.   Overall, I was very pleased with my meal and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! My boyfriend and I were blown away by the food and service. Cannot say enough about this place. We were in town from California and wish I could eat here every week. Our server was fantastic as well and I wish I could remember her name but we were there on Sunday Aug 20th so tell her thank you from the couple from California who were the last to leave, and to Dave or David?  who stopped us on the street the next day and shook our hand because he recognized us from the night before. We're in the rest buis so I can attest this place rules!"}
{"text":"A nice location with a lively atmosphere. The menu is extensive and has reasonable options for the vegetarian. Some things are strange, though. For example they take a perfectly good vegetarian item like tortilla espagnola and wrap it in jamon. Why do this? I figure the reason is they just don't care if the vegetarian guest is well served.There were some very nice other items including the patatas bravas. In all a good experience."}
{"text":"If I had to describe Morcilla in one word it would be \"underwhelming.\" It's probably my fault for having such high expectations, but I was generally disappointed with it and will probably not be back. I love tapas more than any kind of food, but was not overly impressed with anything at Morcilla besides the dessert. I'm not confused about what to expect at a tapas place, but everything we ordered was unusually small and overly expensive. I was continually sad to see such small portions and high prices. Most of the food was good, but it wasn't mind blowing. The servers were also very attentive with filling our water, but lacked charisma and did not improve the experience.   While dining at Morcilla our table ordered: 1. Serrano ham- table mates liked it but described it like \"regular prosciutto\"  2. Poquillo rellenos de bacalao- was tasty but disappointingly small. If I had to describe it in layman's terms: small piece of toast with potato and a pepper on top. We ate it in four tiny forkfuls.  3. Churro de cangrejo y estagon- apparently really popular crab and tarragon churro but nothing special. I was not impressed with the flavor or grease and mayo (aioli) combo.  4. Queso de cambra- delicious, but $6 for three small cheese croquettes. If we had ordered four of these plates I would have been satisfied. If there had been at least two more on the plate I would have been less annoyed. 5. Mushroom plate- flavorful and unique  6. Bacalao- very interesting and innovative, but also tiny and $14.  7. Canelone crepe- enjoyed by my table mates. I don't eat duck so I couldn't really tell you.   The best part of the meal was the creme brûlée type desert we ordered. It was phenomenal. If everything else we ate had been similar to the desert, I would be rating Morcilla 5 stars.  I can honestly say I've never been so confused about a restaurant's Yelp rating as I am with Morcilla. I feel like it should be rated 3 stars and if I could give half stars I'd be giving it a 2.5 right now. I'm kind of confused in the way people have jumped on the Morcilla bandwagon. Maybe it's because I don't eat enough meat, and their impressive dishes are meat based? Or maybe I wasn't invited when everyone decided to drink the Kool-Aid."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk, to Morcilla. And bring along a few friends while you're at it so you can share and sample a bunch of plates family-style. This place lives up to all the hype, plus more, which is becoming increasingly harder to do in Pittsburgh's buzzing food scene. Make sure you make a reservation, especially on the weekends, when spots fill up really fast."}
{"text":"Visited a week ago with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Overall, the food was very good and the ambiance was perfect. Yes, it's expensive and the portions are small, but it was worth it.  For drinks, my boyfriend had 2 beers and I had the Patxaran Espumosa which was a simple cocktail containing only 2 ingredients: cava and patxaran (a Spanish liqueur that kind of tastes like berries). My cocktail was small but the taste was on point.   For food, we got the following: Chorizo - Small thin slices of chorizo w/ dates and Cabrales cheese...delicious balance of salty and sweet! This was one of my favorites of the night. Poquillo Rellenos de Bacalao - A pepper filled w/ potato. I thought this was just okay but I am biased because I don't normally like peppers. Churro de Cangrejo y Estragon - This was amazing! This is essentially fried dough made with crab and tarragon. Comes with a creamy dipping sauce. Foie Gras Croquetas - Probably my least favorite dish. Tasted okay. Loved the rhubarb sauce but I have come to the conclusion that I am just not a huge fan of foie gras. Pigs Feet and Cheeks Croqueta - Good but didn't stand out. Alitas de Pollo en Adobo - WOW! We loved, loved, loved these chicken wings. These were the most expensive chicken wings we have ever had ($14 for 6), but they are amazing. Perfectly crisp skin, sauce was unique and full of flavor. Costillas de la Matanza - Smoked baby back pork ribs. Fall of the bone. They had a little too much pork flavor for me..I know, sounds weird :P  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here today with a friend. Service is really good. Parking and reservation wasn't an issue for a Saturday lunch. Had a 3 course meal: Mojama for appetizer, Lengue De Res for meal and tried both dessert that was on the menu, Churros and Crema Catalana. Mojama would be probably better with some wine, doesn't have any fish taste to it, you can mostly just taste the pine nuts and chili oil, not spicey. The Baguette is warm and it mostly tasted like roster red pepper, I really enjoyed it. From the desserts I would favor the cream burley vs the donut sticks with dark chocolate fondue. My only issue is that when I left I was still hungry. I guess my meal just wasn't very filling. Love the atmosphere of the place though."}
{"text":"Torn between 3 and 4 stars but leaning towards 3. Dishes were a mix of a hits and misses for me. But I guess that's the fun of tapas!?  A group of friends and I (6 people total) had a reservation here. First off, we arrived around 5 minutes early but were made to wait for our table to be ready until around 10 minutes after our reservation time. This is disappointing for a higher priced restaurant.  We were hungry and it would have taken a while to consolidate our order choices, so we decided to go for the \"Family Feast\" for our table. This is a 4 course set dinner (more than 4 dishes) for the entire table, $45/person. The waitress explained that this was a good choice for people who were dining at Morcilla for the first time and want the Morcilla experience. The amount of food and dishes was perfect, but I would definitely choose what to order myself if I were to do it again.  Here's a quick rundown of what was memorable, going off the list on their website.  Snacks (warm bread, almonds, olives): Highlight were the lavender flavored nuts. I'm pretty sure we got nuts that weren't almonds, but I don't remember exactly what. They give a lot of olives so you can keep munching on them throughout the meal.  Charcuterie: I was so excited for the cured meats here, and they let me down. The lomo slices came with kumquat preserves on top. The kumquats were extremely sweet and overwhelming, and the syrup got on all the slices of the meat. The kumquats were nice, but I felt like I couldn't enjoy or taste the lomo. Chorizo was in a pool of oil. Wouldn't choose to order it again.  Croquetas de bacalao: These were pretty good, would recommend as a small dish.  Arroz con pitu de caleya: Basically rice with chicken. The chicken was extremely soft. A crowdpleaser, but not a very exciting dish.  Champinones a la plancha: My favorite dish of the night! That oyster mushroom mixture with the egg was sooo good!  Churros with chocolate hazelnut fondue: Tastes just like it sounds. Chocolate sauce isn't too sweet which is nice.  For drinks, I ordered a pitcher of the Sangria Espumosa. Our table agreed that we probably would have enjoyed either the red of white wine sangrias more."}
{"text":"Morcilla has a great atmosphere, great service and really, really good food.  A few things blew us away but a few were just okay, so it evens out to a solid, 4 star review.   Amazing: tortilla espanola, any of the cured meat, homemade soft drinks, sangria, croquetas.  Just Okay: We didn't love the lamb meatballs, they seem to be a crowd favorite so maybe it was just our night, but they were REALLY intense in flavor, a little too much for us.  The crab churros also were just okay.  They were a little dry, and the dipping sauce was good but heavy, so if you used it to outweigh the dryness, the flavor was way too much.   Overall it's definitely a place I'd recommend.  I think next time I'll focus on the cured meat dishes because they really were outstanding."}
{"text":"This place really is as good as everyone says it is. Delicious food and impeccable service. Try the ox tail, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner and drinks with friends. Came here on a weeknight early evening and we were not able to get a table for 2 (highly recommend reservations) but they also serve a full menu at the bar and provide amazing service! I ordered the beefeater gin and tonic all evening. I just recently tried to go back for that specific drink just because I loved it so much. The bartender also crafted a delicious drink for my friend based on her preferences. I absolutely love the tapas menu for sharing and the queso en aceite was my favorite. It was this delicious cheese dish and even after all the cheese was gone the oil was great for dipping bread in."}
{"text":"In town this last weekend from NY to see Bruce Springsteen,  I've been to San Sebastian and as we say in Brooklyn not for nothing Espana you got nothing on Morcilla.  Just superb Spanish (really basque) food, reasonably priced, great service.   Great varied menu with tapas and some large dishes.  Beware if you order the large plate chicken which is superb it can feed 4 we ordered it for two of us along with tapas way to much great food.  Kudos to the manager of who I was informed used to work in Brooklyn.  This gentleman knows how to manage a bustling busy happening restaurant.  Oh yeah its casual.  Bravo well done.."}
{"text":"Many of the dishes we had were exceptional especially a dish of mushrooms and I really enjoyed my gin and tonic (do try it). Only thing I did not enjoy was the tortilla which for no good reason was slathered in a chipotle sauce which made it inedible. The only misstep in an otherwise great meal."}
{"text":"Definitely my new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. From the folks that brought us Cure, comes Morcilla. I've had everything on the menu at least twice and there isn't anything that I wouldn't recommend. You'll feel like you are in Spain when you walk in and see that the bar has no seats, a refrigerated display that holds ready-to-eat snacks (pintxos), and cured meat hanging from the ceiling. From ingredients to presentation, there is not one thing missing. You can order small plates and create a multi course experience or have a traditional meal by selecting a starter and a second course. I've been here a half dozen times and I'm 50/50 on small plates vs large plates. Just know that however you order, you will not make a mistake.. unless you don't order enough!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Morcilla! Last summer I went to San Sebastián, Spain where I enjoyed Basque cuisine. Morcilla certainly represents the spirit of this wonderful culinary paradise while preserving the individual style and creativity of the chef Justin Severino. Will return for more!"}
{"text":"My friend from Spain told me that this not the authentic Spain Culinary but most of dishes tastes food despite of the fact some recipes are not originally from Spain. I also like their service and their atmosphere with candlelight."}
{"text":"An amazing Spanish dining experience right here my hometown.   As soon as i walked in, the vibe of a boccaria"}
{"text":"Amazing creative menu. Dave was an attentive, polite server that was very helpful for us to choose the menu. Very noisy. And as others have mentioned on yelp, VERY unconfortable chairs.   Peach sorbet, caramel bbq ribs, lavender Almonds, ham, and smoked goat cheese are a home run."}
{"text":"Love the place. Get the oxtail and get plenty of it. The ribs, which were recommended by the waiter, were amazing. Lamb meatballs were good and interesting. Drinks were underwhelming but the carafe of house red was really good and reasonable. Overall not disappointed and highly recommend. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to Morcilla. It is easy to go to a restaurant and have a fantastic meal. It is impossible to go to a restaurant, order 8 menu items, and have every single one be perfection. That is what you get at Morcilla. Impeccable. In two trips, everything has been fantastic and consistent.   My only nit is that the second time I went with a friend and the waiter acted like she wasn't at the table.  The waiter spoke only to me. This did not happen when I was here last Friday, so I hope it was a fluke.   Be adventurous. Try everything, share everything.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I love the food at cure, but the portions are unreasonably small and so pricey. The food is good, but I can't justify spending that much money and walking away hungry, even if the dishes were interesting and tasty.  I came with 3 other people and we tried to sample a bunch of things. Most dishes were really hard to share, which I found strange for a tapas place since I thought the point was to share and sample. We ordered nearly half the menu trying to get full, by to no avail. I will mention that we had to avoid pork, so maybe if we ordered one of the large dishes which were pork based maybe we could have been full.  I think this place would be good for a pre-dinner appetizers or small nibble and drinks, but don't come here and expect to be full!"}
{"text":"A really unique spot to have in Pittsburgh. Think the Spanish version of Cure. Great variety in terms of cured meats and a great place to go share plates. The restaurant does get extremely loud, service was fantastic -the food was good to very good. Tried the ox tail-like a short rib French onion soup sandwich(best Dish i had). The beef tartar was an extremely fresh and light take on the dish which was really nice. The chorizo was fantastic and the ribs were fall off the bone and not to filling. I would give this a 4.5 if I could but I think the restaurant lacks a signature dish and if I would say cure is a 5 it's tough to give their sister restaurant the same rating but it is close."}
{"text":"New(ish) joint from Justin Severino.  Tapas.  Spain by Disney.  Angry bartendress.  Boomin'/ crowded.  I was solo, so I had chorizo plate.  I have the same complaint about Morcilla and about Cure..... where I had steak tartare.  The concept/ vibe of both buildings I found inviting but in a Damien Hirst kinda way.  Morcilla has gotten an infinite amount of attention and praise.  It's worth going to see what \"the best Pittsburgh has to offer\"."}
{"text":"So much meat! The small meat plates bring a lot of meat. The morcilla and chorizo were delicious. Oh, the pulpit was perfectly tender. The bar staff gave us great recommendations."}
{"text":"Trying to get a handle on this great spot is not easy.  It sits in the uneasy overlap between a tapas place and a fine dining restaurant. The only reservation I could snag was 4 p.m. on a Sunday. When I returned the obligatory call to confirm, I was told that I could not come later as they were \"fully committed to our other guests.\"  In contrast, our server was totally friendly and completely unpretentious. She fully explained a menu that needed little explanation -- I didn't have the heart to interrupt,  We began with an Oloroso sherry for me and the house white sangria for my partner. Both were perfect.  While I considered an \"All the Meats\" it seemed like it would unbalance the meal, so we plumped for Iberico, Fuet and Cecina instead. The perfectly sliced Iberico was topped with halved Marcona almonds. There is no question it was handled properly, still it is better and cheaper on its home turf. (I envied another table's Serrano - a more generous portion to be sure) The chef's homeamde fuet was excellent, fatty and flavorful. I had never had the Spanish style cecina, which is more like bresaola or bunderfleisch than the beef jerky style Mexican cecina. It was delicate and mild. The fuet and cecina were served with toasts, we asked and received extras to have enough for the iberico as well. Definitely spring for the chef's cured meats.  I segued into a glass of Tempranillo.  We limited ourselves to once conserva, the beets. They were babies and barely trimmed, so you ate the whole delicate thing. Four to a portion. To me, conservas would also mean the tinned seafood so beloved in Spain but none are found in this section of the menu.  From the croquetas, we chose pigs' feet and cheeks the squash and maple giving it a taste of Thanksgiving. The texture was perfect, but I didn't find the flavor profile to be Spanish, despite the pimenton. Still they were delicious, and the three balls were gone in falsh.  Next up was the eponymous Morcilla. A single delicate sausage, on a bed of chestnut puree. The highlight of the meal. The oxtail Montadito was also superb, the Mahon cheese more pungent than I expected, the melt in your mouth quality unlike any other Montadito in my experience.  We finished with a half order of the ribs. Meltingly tender as well, they were a good segue to dessert.  I had originally intended to order the frozen crema Catalana and the churros, but a cooler head prevailed, and we found the good sized crema sufficient for two. Think a warm burnt caramel creme brulee topping over a frozen panna cotta.   About $180 for two people with tip, total of three drinks, no coffee or tea. Worth it."}
{"text":"Service was dismissive. Food was ok relative to other tapas and pinchos places in the north east. Maybe this is the best or close to good that Pittsburgh can offer but when compared to the rest of the north east, this place is umm so so. Not a place I would recommend as a place for foodies to check out."}
{"text":"Easily makes my top 3 restaurants in Pittsburgh list.   I'll start with the staff - so attentive yet not overwhelming. We had multiple servers, and despite the restaurant being full we never felt like we were waiting too long or that they were pestering us.   The food was all incredible. Very rarely does my family go to a restaurant where everyone loves every single dish. As it's a tapas style restaurant, the plates are small but we loved tasting so many things and we also didn't feel so uncomfortably full at the end.   Get the pork confit, don't even question it. Incredible flavor and the pork was so tender, it was also a good size for a main dish. Don't expect large portions. We also ordered the crab churros, lomo, goat cheese croquettas, morcilla montaditos, leek potato chorizo stew, lamb meatballs, duck crepe, and the chocolate and churros for dessert of course. We loved every single thing, each dish had unique flavors and every plate came out hot and obviously fresh. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Muy, muy pequeña tapas. I lived in Miami for several years and have eaten at many Spanish-style tapas restaurants, but I have never been to a tapas restaurant quite like this (and I don't mean that in a good way). While yes, \"tapas\" is Spanish for \"snacks\", I expected that a $14 duck plate would consist of a bit more than literally two bites of duck and a couple slices of apple. The other plates and montaditos we tried also consisted of extremely small tapas portions. While I don't mind spending money at a nice restaurant, I shouldn't still be hungry after spending a significant sum of money at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure that I would like this place when my husband made a reservation but I was definitely pleasantly surprised! I initially found the menu confusing (which led to my initial ambivalence) but the waitress was very helpful, made great recommendations, and the food was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"It's opening night and I just left. This place is so neat. They have a really interesting menu full of surprises. There were a ton of small bites, small plates, full meals and more. I would recommend going with a pal and sharing a ton of treats. We had cured pork loin, lamb meatballs, beef tartare, pork spare ribs, and a pork loin in the best vermouth sauce I've ever had.   For it being opening night, the food deliver pace was on point. We were in and out in 1 hour 10 minutes. The staff is amazing.   My friend and I are huge fans of Cure and we couldn't wait for this place to open.   Make a reservation right now and go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Maybe the best meal I've ever had in Pittsburgh. We got (in very, very rough order of how much we liked them):  Sobrasada Oxtail Serrano ham Salt cod croquettes Octopus Beef tartare Beets Olives Patatas bravas Churros Queso  This was a ton of food for two people -- we were both incredibly stuffed after, and yet there were still more things on the menu we would have liked to have tried (eg brussel sprouts, ribs, and especially more charcuterie). That said, we really liked all of the above, and I'd be fine getting any of those dishes (besides for maybe the queso) again.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go. So many people told me this was an amazing place that I was very excited to go and give a try.  So, if I understand correctly, this is a Spanish restaurant. Having visited Spain on many occasions, I am expecting to have a convivial environment, a good slow-priced food in small portions. What we basically call \"tapas\". I am expecting to have good house wine and Sangria.  So, I came, ordered the Patatas Bravas, which is the basic tapas. I ordered the lomo, another basic. And I ordered another dish that consists on a spread on a toast. There is an obvious effort to make the food nice. But the portion are ridiculously small (a toast is the size of a cracker - no kidding!) and the effort to make the food tasty ends up in an overdose of salt. After that, I ordered the salad and the lamb meatballs. Same thing: really small portions and too much salt.  With four glasses of house wine (you have to eat the Spanish way, right?), the check was $72 ... and I was still hungry after that.  Spanish food is basic, good, cheap, accessible. Morcilla fails at all of this. Morcilla falls in the same trap than almost all french restaurant in the USA: they are trying to overdo things and just do not respect the basics.  A real disappointment to me."}
{"text":"After hearing such great reviews, I came all the way from NYC, where I've worked as a professional cook for 3 decades, to sample your Spanish cuisine. Because i am Basque from Bilbao, I feel compelled to say that pintxos are not just a fancy word for tapas, they are a style of cooking from northern Spain. While the flavors are creative and interesting, the menu is not very authentic and the portions are insufficient and overpriced. I even had to ask for bread, a staple at the Spanish dinner table, to accompany my cheese, aceitunas, and jamon --- and I was charged for it. I was particularly looking forward to your flagship food, morcilla. A very small sausage link was served, doused in sauce. While the sauce was flavorful, the flavors of the tiny morcilla were drowned out. A good restaurant overall, but definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"Expectations influence experience. Fair or unfair it is true.  When you watch an Oscar nominated film you expect better than when you watch a Razzie.  Your filter changes.  So when you eagerly visit a restaurant of one of your favorite cuisines by a chef from one of your favorite restaurants (Cure) with the buzz of being the hottest opening in a foodie town your expectations are high.  Atmosphere:  The restaurant is beautiful.  Woodwork throughout represents incredible craftsmanship and looks very authentic to a typical upscale Spanish Tapas restaurant.  The Jamon hangs from the ceiling above a traditional tapas counter top display that makes you feel like you are on the Iberian peninsula.  Where this goes wrong is the playlist.  Perhaps i am being too literal but while a glass of chianti or scotch with Frank Sinatra is a great night on most occasions this is not what I look for with Spanish inspiration.  Flamenco, spanish guitar or other traditional music would better fit the bill.  Service: Very good, prompt, knowledgeable and attentive  Drinks: Cocktails were very nice - specifically the Gin and Tonics.  The red sangria was better than the white.  Food:  The important stuff.  Again to me Spanish cuisine is borderline perfection.  Tradition and ingredients trump creativity.  We can run through the Great, good and meh but overall if you live by the belief that octopus, chorizo and croquetas are some of the best things on earth you will be disappointed with the overuse/abuse of aioli and the lack of traditionalism.    Highlights:  Bacalao en Aceite, Matrimonio, Pimientos de Padrones (no need for the aioli), Jamon croqueta  Underwhelming dishes: Pulpo - admittedly this is a sacred dish for me and it was overpowered by sauce vs. standing on the flavor of the octopus Beef Tartare Montadito - nothing special Abuse of Aioli!!! I like Aioli its delicious but no need to include in every dish.  Tapas should stand on the flavor and quality of the lead item and not the sauce.  Additionally, Tapas mean you are eating many and the reliance on this one ingredient lead to a blend of flavors.  We went hoping for a 5. We ended at a 3.  We will be back but expected more and hope Morcilla can find its way to living up to the hype."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch date and was fairly impressed. We sat at the bar next to the open window and were very comfortable. We split about six of the different plates and had several cocktails. The bartenders were amazing and their cocktail list is divine. My favorite plates were the fried fingerling potatoes (omg that smoked paprika aioli they're served with is to DIE FOR) and the octopus. Unfortunately, we still left hungry and our bill was almost $200. Definitely not filling by any means, but was a great spot for a boozy lunch."}
{"text":"We had:  QUESO EN ACEITE - yum. manchego cheese on carbs is good.  PULPO ESCABECHE - perhaps the most disappointing dish of the night. There were three tiny bits of Octopus. $14 for pretty much potatoes is a biiiit pricey, my friend!  PORK BELLY A LA PARRILLA - perhaps our favorite of the night. An explosion of all the right flavors.  BLISTERED PADRON PEPPERS - nice light snack.  COSTILLAS DE LA MATANZA - we ordered a half rack, we thought these were just ok  The cocktails were good. I recommend the Humo y Vino. Mezcal is da best.  All in all, for the above and four cocktails we paid $120ish + tip.   TL;DR Small portions, kinda overpriced, good cocktails, not enough Octopus, attentive service."}
{"text":"Nouveau small plates. Nice cocktails. Engaged staff who listened and gave thoughtful responses and suggestions. Menu not extensive, but deep; innovative, not obnoxious. Seriously yummy.   Don't expect the plates described elsewhere in these reviews. My guess is they buy what's fresh and set the menu accordingly.   Utilitarian atmosphere was only a slight drawback. Tables were spartan and extremely close together. Think \"tapas joint.\" Go for great food and great service. Not for romance. Unless you're romancing a Foodie."}
{"text":"Frankly, I was a bit disappointed especially after reading the terrific NYTimes article about Morcilla.  It was good, but definitely not great. The manchego (cubes) were soaked in olive oil, and croquettas were tiny and quite oily. Surprised not to see paella on the menu. Perhaps think about adding that and migas. There were no albondigas, steak paillard, empanadas, figs & bacon with a reduction balsamic sauce, goat cheese and mushrooms. The list can go on of menu items they are missing. I've definitely had MUCH better!  Note to host staff - it's really pronounced Mor-thee-ya rather than Mor-see-ya."}
{"text":"So much better than I thought it would be! We had oysters, pig skin, salami, ribs and oxtail. All of it was excellent and we most appreciated the attentive and knowledgeable service, which is often lacking in this town! Oh and the churros... Yum! Will be back."}
{"text":"I am going to focus on the negative because I think this could be a 5 star place maybe 5+ or some other suoerlative...You get the idea.  I think there are things that would make it better that are within reach.  That said this is a wonderful place which I enjoyed and would gladly return.  Things that should be worked on:  1.  The salumi is great but it isn't a dish in and of itself.  Getting paper thin slices of cured beef or pork is great but if all there is as accompaniment is a peperoncini and two thin baguette slices that are like crackers, well that's just not that interesting if I am there to dine.  If I was at the bar and this was a way to get me some salt so I had more.beer then I get it but these are not free giveaway dishes designed to encourage consumption of libations.  They are part of the dinner menu.  I would love to see the kitchen do something creative with the cured meats as in actually make something new with them.  2.  The seats are absolutely the least comfortable I have ever sat in in a restaurant not by a roadside in a third world country.   I get that turnover is good, but these seats made me want to stand and eat.  It's rare for seating to actually detract from a meal but these seats do (if you are lucky enough to sit on a bench good for you.  I didn't actually sit on a bench but unless the bench was on fire it would probably have been better than my chair.  Those are my 2 cents.  I actually think the veggish items were better than the straight up charcuterie. ."}
{"text":"For us first-time visitors to Pittsburgh, it didn't escape our notice that the city has received a bunch of national notices for its dining scene in the last few years.  The chef here, Justin Severino, gets mentioned in almost of those pieces.    We chose Morcilla for a big birthday dinner for one of us (I'll leave it at that!), and the restaurant came through with flying colors for that occasion.  Severino is most renowned as a magician of cured meats, based on his original restaurant down the avenue, Cure.  Not surprisingly, Morcilla's got an outstanding selection of charcuterie.  It'd be easy get lost in this first section of the menu and have no appetite left over for anything else.  (In fact, Morcilla offers \"All of the Meats\" for 50 bucks, and any big party should take advantage of that.  Hell, maybe just you and you and a single guest should make a trip just for that purpose.)  But we forced ourselves to make some tough cured-meat choices, and the namesake morcilla (basically a spicy pork salami) and Surryano Ham turned out to be great ones.  (That Surryano, which is a steal here for $7, comes from the excellent Edwards Smokehouse in Tidewater Virginia, which had a huge fire not ago and tragically lost tons of product.  Get it while you can.)    We also had the bacalao (codfish) en aceita, the \"Who Cooks for You\" salad (ground cherries, smoked goat cheese, candied pistachio, & peach-amontillado vinaigrette), and Spanish mackerel.  All terrific as well.  We wanted a little bit more, so we asked for the Cordero en Moreno (that was lamb meatballs in very North African yogurt sauce) and a half dozen oysters (out of Marblehead, Mass.).  More excellence.    The staff handled the birthday stuff with understated aplomb, and our main server did her job well all night.  Morcilla's got an attractive old-looking bar up front (even though the restaurant is almost brand new), and the back dining area has high vaulted ceilings and is comfortably and nicely appointed.  Only minor complaint with the whole experience is that the noise levels got kind of oppressive as the early evening became night.  All in all, easily one of the best two or three meals we've had all year."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Morcilla! Although I have unfortunately only had drinks once at Morcilla, it was a fabulous time. My friend and I sat at the bar, but I couldn't help observing the rest of the place - beautiful! To drink, I had the Park Guell - something about the ingredient jasmine caught my eye and I knew I had to try it. It was beautifully crafted and so refreshing. Additionally, because I'm a lush and tempted with a good time, I decided to try the Sangria Rosada, too.  I would love to come back to eat some time soon!"}
{"text":"I have been eying up Morcilla for a while now. My coworker says this is his favorite restaurant so we ended up making reservations a month in advance. Is this place good for big groups (over 6)? No, definitely not. It's really small inside.   This was my first time trying Spanish tapas and I went all in with the octopus a la plancha and the costillas de la matanza. I never tried octopus tentacles before and I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm not a big fan of rubbery textures so I was hoping for the best.  The octopus came out on a sesame yogurt base, cucumbers, crispy pickled chickpeas and merguez spice. The octopus was cooked to perfection and almost caramelized exterior. The interior wasn't rubbery what so ever, but very tender. I highly recommend this dish (just keep in mind the menu changes often). The costillas de la matanza (baby back ribs) was dressed in a pomegranate sherry caramel, scallions, coriander, and crunchy black olive. The ribs fell right off the bone and were nice and crispy. I did try the beef tartare and chicharones both equally delicious! Pretty sure this is the type of restaurant where everything is prepared to perfection.   I wish I could say the same about the service. Our waitress left a lasting impression of having absolutely no personality at all. She couldn't have had her nose anymore up in the air than she did that night. She acted like we did a disservice to her by not sharing our plates. My friend also had her as a waitress at his previous visit and mentioned that she acted like that back then too. Service can and will ruin a business. I don't think that waiting tables is her calling."}
{"text":"The ribs were weak. Little to no flavor infused into them. I was really excited to try them and I held out to just have those. Waited nearly an hour and a half (mainly because we had a lot of food coming out as a party of 4) and the ribs were a massive disappointment. They were cooked well but it tasted like chewing meat just to chew meat.   You'll probably like everything else they have there but maybe don't try the ribs."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, if not anywhere. Every aspect is well thought out and perfectly executed. My husband and I have eaten here twice, both times have been amazing. We spent our honeymoon in Spain and visited San Sebastián, the home of Spanish pintxos. This restaurant always reminds me of that amazing trip. The food is well executed and delicious. The last time we went we stopped in on a whim expecting to either not get seated or maybe wait for a bar seat. The staff was so accommodating, they were able to fit us in the dinning room by chance. Service is superb. Highly recommend the pickled cauliflower, amazing dish."}
{"text":"Food was all it was talked up to be! I definitely recommend the churro for both a starter and dessert!  My only complaint is that our server, who was a middle aged man with dark hair, was very odd. At times he made me uncomfortable.  When I come back, I just hope he isn't my server!"}
{"text":"There's nothing bad I can say about this restaurant. The menu from top to bottom was fantastic, hand crafted cocktails were amazing, and the atmosphere cozy, and service was impeccable. We had a party of three and we decided to each pick some things and share, I wish we wouldn't have done that, everything we ate I wanted for myself. I recommend this place over any tapas bar in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Morcilla was a really great experience but doesn't quite hold a torch to its sister restaurant, Cure.   We started with All The Meats, a really generous sampling of the charcuterie menu. The chorizo, Morcilla sausage, pork loin, Serrano ham, and spreadable selections were the standouts. You can't go wrong with that menu.  Jamon croquettes were terrific as was the manchego cheese. We ordered a few tapas for our mains including duck, oxtail, Brussels sprouts, and artichokes. The meats were delicious. The vegetables fell short. The Brussels sprouts were quite vinegary and the artichokes were just a bit boring.  Churros and crema Catalana were both great desserts. Overall, a great experience with just a few shortcomings."}
{"text":"Wow. It completely lived up to the hype! I can't even completely remember what we ordered because I was in a daze from the overwhelming deliciousness.  We had some friends in town from Montreal and wanted to show them a good time. We opted for Morcilla because of the rave reviews. All of the dishes were incredible but the ones that stood out the most were the jamon iberico, oxtail, octopus, and the smoked baby back ribs. It was so good my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. Get reservations and go!"}
{"text":"I blame my disappointment on myself, honestly.  I should have expected that an establishment like this would be severely overhyped, but I couldn't help but want to try Pittsburgh's own James Beard-nominated \"best new restaurant.\"  After waiting 4 weeks for a Saturday reservation at 5pm, we arrived at the restaurant 6 minutes before our reservation time to find the establishment closed to the public with a sign on the door.  A small crowd of hopeful diners gathered outside the door as the team within just stood there and watched us.  I understand that many restaurants do this--refuse to open their doors a minute before \"opening time\"--mostly just because they feel that they can get away with it, and I just find it to be extremely poor customer service.  I'm here a polite few minutes before my reservation, and I'm not trying to disrupt your pre-service ritual--I'm just trying to get out of this 34 degree April snowfall.  Once we were allowed inside at precisely 5, service was decent enough for our party of 6.  Our server made recommendations for how much food to order and was honest what we should expect for plate sizes.  My SO and I ordered the OXTAIL Montadito, the PIMIENTOS DE PADRONES, PUERRO A LA PLANCHA, and the BACALAO Plate.  We both liked the oxtail--the meat was super tender, and the funkily fragrant Mahon cheese was a wonderful complement.  The padrone peppers were tasty but nothing very special, while the spring onions were delightfully sweet and nicely charred.  The bacalao was nice and tender but had little flavor by itself--my favorite bite on the plate was the cauliflower.  My fiancee disliked the lemony notes in the green sauce on the plate, feeling it to be rather dissonant against the fish, or, in his words, \"This tastes like cheap lemon-lime jello.\"  Overall, nothing was UN-tasty, per se, and the oxtail could even be called excellent, but nothing blew our minds.  I enjoyed the flavors of the vegetable dishes, but they were both so oily that it was a bit repulsive.  My green onions' romesco sauce sat in a moat of grease.  Our friends who ordered the ALCACHOFA A LA PLANCHA felt the same way about their dish--their artichokes came with oil pooled in the hearts.  While I appreciate Severino's take on a tapas restaurant, I feel that $6 for 3 bites of oxtail on a baguette chip is complete departure from the spirit of a true Spanish tapas joint, which offers small bites as a free complement to ordered drinks.  I'm not suggesting his entire menu should be free of charge for a glass of the (pretty decent) red or white sangria--I'm only speculating whether the astonishing high prices for very little and non-lifechanging bites is taking advantage of a PIttsburgh food scene that jumps at anything new and fresh in this town.  My thoughts are, sadly, yes."}
{"text":"Positives:  1. The vegetarian options that are available are delicious. The highlight is the mushrooms a la plancha! 2. The wait staff is very patient and accommodating. Ordering tapas is pretty challenging when everyone at the table is demanding, but our waiter handed it very well. I also appreciated that he warned me about items that seemed vegetarian but were not (e.g. the butternut squash).  Less positive:  1. As you could probably tell, not a lot of vegetarian stuff. 2. It's very, very loud. We went on a Friday night and it was pretty crowded - we were at one of the tables in the center, and we pretty much had to yell the entire night."}
{"text":"Morcilla is on my short list of Pittsburgh favorites.  It's a great date night spot, friends gathering, or a treat-yoself dinner.  The restaurant had a warm ambiance with wooden decor, hipster lighting, and jamón hanging.  For dinner, we ordered the Serrano ham, tomate, chorizo, side of olives, machego queso, the potatoes, and squash.  It was way too much food for two, but we ordered with our eyes.  The a la carte charcuterie tapas came out individually (shame, cause I'd love some charcuterie plating) but the portions were so much bigger than I hoped for!  Every meat has topping accents.  For example, the Serrano ham has Spanish almonds.. the tomate was dipped in basil oil... and the chorizo had dates and blue cheese.  I love that it's not plain and naked.  My favorite out of the three was the tomate.  My friend loved the Serrano ham.  We both thought the cheese was too stinky with the chorizo!  Guess we aren't on the expert level of stinky cheese.  The side of olives was great! And I really loved the taste of the squash.  The potatoes with spicy mayo sauce was very dry.  It was the only dish we didn't enjoy.  Morcilla is everything I need in a tapas restaurant.  Ambiance, wine list, delicious tapas, amazing charcuterie!  I'm excited to try out the rest of the menu on my next visit."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and great service. Nice drink list and wine menu. I went with a friend and we are both pescetarian. I understand that the menu is oriented to meat eaters and that's fine. However I'm always impressed by meaty restaurants that do a great job with fish and veg dishes too, even if they aren't a majority of the menu. We ordered 5 veg/seafood plates to share. The veg dishes were creative but the bill was SO high for measly bites. The portions were extra small for tapas. It would have been nice to have a good crusty bread to go along with the food. Delicious Rioja."}
{"text":"Literally, the very best ribs I have ever had!!  We started off with the Morcilla sausage app which was delicious and then the cod coquettes (ok but not amazing) and Artichokes (YUM) and the anchovy app, which was good but I don't love anchovies so can't really judge.  But back to the ribs....they were so tender and smokey and amazing!  Great place, will be back soon"}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY GOOD. I had mixed expectations: low due to disappointing tapas experiences in Pittsburgh and cautiously hopeful based on Justin Severino's prior endeavors. On a whim made New Year's Eve reservations and was very glad I did! The food was superb, with attention to detail and respect for authenticity. The service was quite impressive. And the cocktails were excellent as well."}
{"text":"After going here for drinks one time, I knew I had to come back for a full meal. I would love to recommend specific dishes to try, but I really can't because they were all so phenomenal. The menu is tapas based, which might disappoint some who don't understand that they really are supposed to be quite small plates, but the quality is excellent and you get to try so many more things this way! I went with four people total and I'd say that was the perfect number so that you could try a lot of different plates with everyone still getting a bite of each.  The restaurant is actually quite small with limited seating, so you'll likely want to make a reservation. It has an open kitchen and a relaxed, upscale vibe with some Spanish flair. The bar portion in the front is standing only and a great place to grab a drink or try some of their smallest dishes, pinchos and montaditos. The service was great as well. While the food is quite pricey, you are going to have an amazing experience and it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh right now. Reasonable prices given the extremely high quality of the food too.  it is not a traditional tapas restaurant however. So do not go in expecting chopitos or paella. Instead, prepare yourself for a restaurant specializing in charcuterie and pickling. Get a sweet or bitter cocktail and embrace the salty, fatty glory of this menu."}
{"text":"All I can say is: wow. This place is delicious. She had the Sopa de Mariscos, I had the Garbonzo en Piperede. Appetizers were the oysters and the roasted pepper conserva.  Really, the flavor palates could not have been more divergent, especially the sopa and garbonzo dish (which was reminiscent of N African). But all of it was fabulous. Her sopa was perhaps the best fish stew I've ever had.  It was better than my choice, but I'd definitely get all of it again."}
{"text":"This small Spanish restaurant fits right in the Lawrenceville food scene. The food is inventive and tasty; the ambiance is convivial (or, if we take a less charitable spin, very LOUD); the prices are high, but the young hip professional-looking customers don't seem to care.  We ordered a range of dishes, shared family style, at the wise suggestion of our server. On the whole, the portions are probably smaller than the menu category would have suggested (in particular, something under \"plates\" is actually more appetizer sized). We shared: oysters with pickled grapes and mustard seeds (surprisingly refreshing!), ham croquettes (fine, but probably the least impressive of the things we got), a leek and potato stew (NB: chorizo is spicy!), octopus (good complementary sauce), duck leg (absolutely delicious!), and baby back ribs (also very delicious and tender). This was for three people. It may sound like a lot of food, but most dishes, other than the ribs, were really just a few bites (though I think a few bites is exactly the right portion). Good desserts too.  I had a lot of fun, even though it's hard to hold a conversation without resorting to shouting. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Well I have to say, the accolades prove to be right. Morcilla, is by far an impressive and amazing gastro Delight.  Justin Severino and his wife Hilary we're very sweet and great to talk to during and throughout our entire meal. They checked in on us to see how our meal was and every time they brought out more plates, we all just looked at each other and we're very impressed!  There are so many dishes that we got to try.  I'm very excited to say that the oxtail was one of my favorites, the oysters were exceptionally good, along with; surryano ham (OMG), chorizo, tomato and peaches,  tortilla española, pulp escabeche,  Spanish Mackerel,  Cordero en Moreno (lamb meatballs)  I have to say everything was excellent. I look forward to coming back and making this a regular restaurant for my gastro pleasure."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Our servers' knowledge of everything on the menu was incredible and everything he recommended was amazing.  He even brought out a dessert with a birthday candle in it for my husband.  :)  Overall amazing experience and we cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Hip spot on Butler Street.  We came here after a Steelers game -- somehow my friend got us reservations!  I have been to Spain many times.  Upon entering, I was reminded of some of the restaurants in Spain.  The Jambon hanging from the ceiling is truly a sight...and I do not eat pork.  We were promptly seated at our table.  Drinks came quickly.  The wine arrived without delay.  In true tapas fashion, we ordered a series of dishes for the table.  The gazpacho was amazing -- one of the best I have had.  The potatoe bravas were great - the aoli was really flavorful.    I would also recommend the Octopus which was also a great dish.  I was encouraged to try the ox tail as my buddy swears by it.  I did not like but he seemed to love it.  The salads were great.   Perhaps my favorite dish was the cauliflower.     We had the churro for desert.  This was a little disappointing.  I would not get it again.  But the cappuccino was nicely done as was the sherry.  So the desert drinks more than made up for it.  I would love to come back and try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Last night we finally got our chance to eat at this special restaurant. Having just returned from Spain we were very happy at how creative the dishes and drinks were. The cava sangria is delicious and not sweet with aromatic herbs and infused with fruit. The pickled beets were outstanding and complemented with flavorful goat cheese. The octopus was a total surprise. Not anything like I expected and so flavorful. The bacalao was fried which I hadn't had prepared this way before and surrounded by a tahini like sauce....amazing! The bistecca large place was the absolute best. Tender and served with roasted shallots and mashed potatoes.  I could go on and on but the food and drinks were beyond fantastic! Only wish the setting were alittle more comfortable and quiet!!"}
{"text":"What a great brunch! My party and I shared a number of small plates, and literally all of them were fantastic. The tastes were varied between sweet and savory, and everything was cooked to perfection. However, since Morcilla had only recently started serving brunch, there were a few kinks to work out. Namely, the coffee was very weak. However, our waiter let us know that we would not be charged for the coffee - without us even mentioning it. The other issue was that the waiter put many of another table's dishes on our check. Without realizing, we paid. However, only a few minutes later, he came back, apologized and explained what had happened, and proceeded to resolve the issue quickly and efficiently. I was overall very impressed with the service and quality of food we received."}
{"text":"I loved Morcilla.  Great place to come for a bottle of wine and some tapas.  The ambience was great.  We really enjoyed the oxtail and the ribs.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came from San Francisco, CA to visit friends for a wedding. We are obsessed with good food and heard great things about Morcilla and the chef!  When you first walk in, you feel like you walked into some rustic European restaurant. It's beautiful. Cured meat is hanging over the bar. Drinks are strong and good (got the sangria!)  The 4 of us split 8-10 small plates / apps as the entrees apparently take 1-2 hours. We saw one of the large ones and it was gigantic, easily could've fed 4 people alone without any other dishes.   The standouts were the beets conserve with goat cheese, oxtail, and oyster mushrooms with egg yolk. The charcuterie was amazing. Ribs, asparagus, and croquettes were ok. A little dried out. The octopus was good but very very small. Overall, the portions are very very small. We ended the meal with churros and it was delicious.  Service is outstanding, FYI. Bravo, Morcilla!"}
{"text":"As you can probably tell by my recent reviews, I've had a hankering for Spanish food lately.  Decided tonight to try Morcilla, given the great reviews across various rating sites and its a Justin Severino spot.  As someone who has been to Spain and Portugal a great deal, I have to say I was really disappointed with the food just not being authentic Spanish in any way.  I found the flavors to be pretty bland sadly.  We ordered the following dishes:  Serrano Ham (4/5) -- Was good serrano, but the amount for the serving was pretty small as compared to the same priced versions of the dish in Madrid.  Bacalo Croquetas (4.2/5) -- These were probably the best dish we at Morcilla.  Nice size croquetas and good quality cod.  The honey sauce was good, slightly strong, but a good pairing.  Jamon Croquetas (2.75/5) -- Would not consider these croquetas.  These were like one inch diameter balls that had a very hard exterior breading and minimal filling.  The aioli they were served on was an ok pairing, but the dish was very \"meh\".  Brandade de Bacalao (2.75/5) -- The bread served with the dish was a like a hard crouton.  The bacalao spread was very flat on flavor.  Octopus a la Plancha (2.5/5) -- Definitely far from authentic Spanish.  The octopus was tough, meaning it wasnt cooked properly.  Plating was sloppy, when the authentic version of the dish is so simply plated.  Patatas Bravas (2.75/5) -- The potatoes were not very crispy, but were very oily.  The aioli was average.  Charcoal Roasted Creamed Corn (2.9/5) -- One of the dishes that I have never seen on a menu in Spain, but decided to try it with local fresh corn in the region.  The dish was again average. Seemed under seasoned and bland.  Also though the temperature was off for the dish and should have been hot rather than very luke warm.  Costillas de la Matanza (2.7/5) -- The meat itself was real tender and good quality.  The sauce used those is overly sweet.  The crunch black olives just seemed like an off pair.  Churros (3.2/5) -- Churros were very good with the cinnamon sugar mixture.  The chocolate sauce, again, just was not authentic.  Brought the dish done.  Sangria (3.25/5) -- Adequate, but not sure I would order again at Morcilla.  Had extremely high hopes and cant say I would go back for a second round given the other options of proven commodities.  I really wanted to like it since I am a huge Spanish food fan, but the blandness of the food just really missed the mark.  I do think the inside of the restaurant is very well designed.  Intimate and warm.  So to wrap it up, the food was edible but just was mediocre.  A lot of bland flavors, under seasoned, and the biggest just not being authentic in any shape or form.  High expectations going in, but probably would not return."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night; dinner for two. It was my first time at Morcilla and I was blown away by the quality of the food. Definitely became one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh after my dinner experience here.  Food: 5/5 Given that Morcilla is a tapas-style restaurant, we ordered 4 dishes to start before adding 2 more as we finished our first selections. Everything we ordered was pretty on-point, and came out of the kitchen promptly.  We began the service with Surryano Ham charcuterie, which was deliciously topped with pecans and just the right amount of savoriness. Then came the Oxtail Montadito, which was recommended to us by our server. I liked the fullness of the flavor of the meat. We also got the Pig's Feet & Cheeks Croquetas - another recommendation and also very good. Next came the Pulpo Escabeche, a hearty heap of potatoes and perfectly-done octopus. After these courses, we ordered two more: the Spanish Mackerel (beautiful presentation), and the Duck Escabeche. We concluded the dinner with the hazelnut churros, freshly fried and paired with melted hazelnut chocolate.  Service: 5/5 Our waiter was friendly and offered numerous recommendations, and the speed by which the food came out was phenomenally speedy. We ordered more food as we felt the need to, and never had to wait long for them to arrive at our table despite it being prime dinner hour on a Friday evening.  Value: 4/5 Morcilla is not cheap, but for the quality of the food and the selection it was well worth the price. Our total bill came out to around $90 for the two of us, post tax & tip. We were both stuffed at the end, but not so much that we were uncomfortably so. The plates were perfect for sharing amongst two people, so we were able to enjoy many flavors at a reasonable cost. What I really liked about the menu was the fact that they offered 2oz portions of wine; this was perfect for me because I enjoy the taste of wine but cannot drink a lot of it."}
{"text":"My husband and I fell in love with this place at first sight!  We came to Morcilla after church on Sunday and arrived right as it opened, so it wasn't crowded at all.  We decided to eat at the bar because it looks welcoming and you get to watch the charcuterie preparations and cocktails.  Plus we like to talk to the bartender about his or her drink recommendations.  The Ambiance:  I am a sucker for a well thought out restaurant and bar, and this place was well thought out to me.  You can visibly see their pieces of meat aging right before your eyes, but it isn't creepy or anything.  I really like their material selection from the tiles or hardwood on the floors to the wood/tile selection on the walls.  I could imagine myself in a restaurant in Europe.  It is legit.  The drinks:  They have a nice drink selection.  I'm personally a HUGE gin fan, so when I heard they made their own tonic water I nearly jumped out of my seat to hug the bartender.  I appreciate fine taste!!!  I had the citadelle and it was floral goodness.  I also tried the botanist and it is my new favorite!!! Sweet and floral. My husband had a red sangria and it was probably the most potent sangria I've tasted.  It was REALLY good.  Apparently they have a red, white and rosé sangria option.  The bartender recommended the red and rosé.   The food:   There were so many food options that we were interested in, and we have to go back to try more!  Because the list was so overwhelming, we decided to first try the \"All the Meats\" charcuterie, and it was delicious!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to it. Had dinner there last night. The food was okay but the a/c must have been broken because it was brutally hot there, resulting in us leaving after the first round of apps.  I have eaten at Cure twice and now Morcilla and two of the three times it was uncomfortably hot.  I don't know if I just hit it wrong or they are just not appreciating that the experience is as much about the comfort as it is the food. Don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Hard to believe we hadn't been here in three years. Sad for them to have had the fire but the place looks amazing. The tasting menu was fabulous and a real bargain considering the quantity and quality. I could eat that cider braised chicken and the octopus and the mushrooms every day. It's crowded and it's loud and the staff is nonetheless impeccable at every turn."}
{"text":"The food here blew me away - no exaggeration. My mom loved it too, and she's picky! The food here puts tapas restaurants from San Francisco to shame.   Highlights (hard to pick out what we liked best because it was all so delicious): - Salmon crudo - holy moly, how do they get the mushrooms so crispy? The salmon melted in my mouth and the apples were perfectly spiced. - Who cooks for you farm mesclun green salad - More mushroom amazingness mixed into crisp greens and tangy dressing. I usually hate goat cheese, but I couldn't get enough of the smoked one in this salad. The smokiness cancels out the gaminess which is what I can't stand about garden variety goat cheese.  - Jamon Iberico - super thinly sliced and full of flavor especially when paired with the marcona almonds that come on top of this dish - Queso en aceite - bread so warm i had to wait before I could comfortably handle it, flavorful manchego cheese that isn't too salty, and fragrant olive oil - hints of orange zest. Ah! We swiped every last drop of olive oil from the dish. - Crema catalina - Mom won't stop raving about this dessert even though it ended hours ago. It's more like a parfait with a candied nut layer on the bottom, a citrusy ice cream in the middle, and maple-flavored whipped topping (denser than whipped cream but fluffier than pudding) on top. I've never tasted anything like it, and I pray I'm lucky enough to someday taste it again.   The attentive service (fresh plates ever 2-3 dishes, constant water refills) was the icing on the cake to an incredible dining experience."}
{"text":"As a fanatic of Justin Severino's other Pittsburgh restaurant, Cure, I knew I was in for a treat when visiting Morcilla. What I didn't expect was for it to pass Cure as my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. My dinner experience could not have been better.   Morcilla is a Spanish, tapas restaurant with an emphasis on cured meats. The chef is renown in the US for his curing ability and it shows in every dish. The space itself is unique but fits the food. You almost feel that you are in the family dining room in a Spanish Villa.  Like Cure, the bar staff are exceptional the drinks are phenomenal. I did not have a bad drink and tried four throughout the night. If you'd like something off menu let them know what flavors you appreciate in a cocktail and they will do their best to make a unique drink for you.   I ordered the Family Feast with my girlfriend. At only $45 per person for a full four course meal, it is the best prix fixe experience in Pittsburgh. Not only is it four courses, but there are a large number of plates per course. All in all we shared all of the following: MANZANILLA OLIVES - citrus, rosemary, olive oil, MARCONA ALMONDS - lavender sugar, sea salt, extra virgin olive oil, WARM BREAD - olive oil, MORCILLA ACHORIZADA - pork salami, pigs blood, piquillo pepper conserva, PIMENTONE CHEESE MONTADITO - mahon, idiazabal, manchego, queso de cabra, fermented iberian chili, piquillo peppers, cucumber, dill, OCTOPUS A LA PLANCHA - sesame yogurt, cucumbers, crispy pickled chickpeas, merguez spice, CHAMPINONES A LA PLANCHA - oyster mushrooms, egg yolk, shallot, bread, ARROZ CON PITU DE CALEYA - cider braised chicken, calasparra rice, herbs, BRANDADE DE BACALAO MONTADITO - salt cod, caramelized crab, lemon oil, CHURROS with chocolate hazelnut fondue.  We could barely finish 2/3 of what the brought us and had to take home some leftovers. After trying every dish it was almost impossible to pick favorites. The first course offers the most dishes and largest variety of flavors. The cured meats were salty and full of spices that complimented the meat perfectly. The lavender almonds were also divine.  The small and large plates were absolute perfection. The meatiness of the octopus was cut perfectly by the yogurt sauce, the Championes A La Plancha blew me away. I didn't expect that amount of savory flavor to come from a seemingly simple dish, but it was one in the top of the night for me. The chicken was another dish that seemed simple but is accompanied by a rich variety of flavor that elevates it beyond normal chicken dishes.   I cannot wait to go back, the food is unique in Pittsburgh and could not be more perfectly executed.   TLDR: Order drinks, order the prix fixe (\"family style\") and gorge on delicious savory, salty flavors in unique dishes that you haven't experienced before. Enjoy some of the finest dinners Pittsburgh has to offer."}
{"text":"In town from NYC and wanted to take my mom someplace that represented the best of the new restaurant scene in Pittsburgh. We kicked off with a cocktail and told our server to order dinner for us; told her our few dislikes and said everything else was fair game. She coursed 8 tapas plates and chose wines for us... everything was a TEN! Loved all of it. Attentive service with fabulous suggestions/slections, nice ambiance, and ultimately very approachable food for an affordable price. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Easily a 5/5. One of the better restaurants I have eaten at in any city (at least for the four things that I ordered). The ambiance is warm, inviting, and youthful with no TVs (huge plus). I sat at the bar, but I did notice the tables are very close together, which I would have found off-putting.   I started with the Roasted Pickled Cucumber Conserva with spicy hummus and saffron yogurt ($8). The portion was very generous and the dish was very tasty (4.5/5).    Then ordered just one Jamon Croqueta ($6) because I was curious about the leek ash aioli. It was unreal. The flavor combinations were perfect (5/5).   Then had the tuna crudo ($16) and wow. This dish was spectacular and also generously portioned. The tuna was very fresh and paired perfectly with the accompanying ingredients - saffron sidra, fresh peach, chili oil, crispy shiitake, celery sprouts (5/5).    By this point I was too full to continue eating, but I did anyway and ordered the octopus ($14), which was another home run.    I accompanied my meal with a glass of their Rioja on tap ($6). I would pass on this wine. It was not very tasty.   There seemed to be many other tasty dishes that I wish I could have ordered as well. Either way, this is a \"can't miss\" restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow.  I made sure to hold off on writing this review so it would be my 600th. Obviously, that doesn't mean anything, but it just made writing this review that much more special for me. I love dining out not only in Pittsburgh but all over the country and world, and after much thought, I have named this restaurant my \"favorite restaurant of all time.\"  The hubby and I dined here with two fellow foodies and good friends in mid-February. The experience was exceptional from beginning to end. The restaurant is intimate, but the tables are still well spaced, not too crowded. Our waitress was attentive and made great recommendations. And the food - the food!! Our check was around $400, and considering the quality of our food and our overall experience, we happily paid the tab.  We ordered (and devoured): Bacalao en Aceite Surryano Ham Queso en Aceite Oxtail Queso de Cabra Basque Butter Lettuce Salad Pulpo Cochinillo (recommended for 2)  My personal favorites were the Oxtail, Pulpo, and Cochnillo. The bite of Oxtail - though petite - packed so much flavor that it was quite memorable. The Pulpo (aka octopus) was simple but very well cooked. Finally, trying the Cochnillo was just purely a lot of fun. The \"recommended for 2\" serving was on the menu when we dined - I see the \"recommended for 4\" listed a lot now - but it was plenty for the four of us to share along with everything else we ordered. The pig was just delicious, and I had never consumed anything quite like it.  In addition to the food, we enjoyed a bottle (or was it two?) of wine, and I also had the Park Guell. With \"sparkling rosado\" in the title, I was concerned that the cocktail would be too sweet, but in my opinion, it was a great balance of sweet and sour.  We finished off the evening with two servings of Churros, because apparently we just still weren't full enough.   I cannot wait to return here again! I have actually made reservations a couple times with a friend already, but unfortunately, life's timing just hasn't worked out yet.  So what are you waiting for? Go make reservations now! You can get \"prime time\" weekend reservations about four weeks in advance currently."}
{"text":"So I have attempted to write this review on several occasions...with intent of reliving my first experience at Morcilla...and then my first and my second experiences at Morcilla...I had a list of all 500 items I ordered and planned to regale and delight by detailing every nuance of every dish. Well, now there are too many items I've eaten and who has the time? So here are my cliff notes: The food is amazing. The space is intimate. You can spend a ton of money or a modest amount, player's choice. If you are given a lemon to squeeze on something, use it. If you have a picky spouse, ditch them (or lie to them about the dish if you can get away with it). If you are given the opportunity to go, do it."}
{"text":"I am all about trying new things and there are not many limits to what I will eat, but I just dont understand all the rage that Morcilla is getting. Maybe I just expected more, especially for the $200 bill and leaving hungry, only 4 alcoholic drinks on that bill, the rest all food.. I will give it another try eventually, hopefully earlier in the evening, but Pittsburgh has too many new places to choose from to just rave about this one. One thing to note, our waitress, I believe her name was Colleen was absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"So I hesitated a bit with the rating of this review, partly because I can't but help compare it to Cure where every bite was a feast for the senses, and for me Morcilla had some great food and just really fantastic service, but it didn't quite reach Cure's level and I'm struggling to put into words why.   It was a group of 7 of us and we ordered a fair bit of food including the Charcuterie sampler platter, the suckling pig, the tuna tartare, potatoes bravas, blood sausage with acorn relish, sous vide Octopus and a jug of sangria.   I don't know if there was someone on the table who was a food hog, or if the pieces were miscounted, but by the time the platter got to me, and I was the second last person to be served, a lot of the meat only had x 1 piece left and the person served after me definitely missed out on some of the Charcuterie! Btw, what I tasted of this platter was great - really perfectly curated.   I really liked the rest of our menu choices too - we had some fussy eaters who ended up loving the blood sausage to their surprise and our table had a lovely conversation then about haggis vs blood pudding and white pudding. I loved the acorn relish and licked the plate clean with a piece of bread- I wasn't letting any of that food item go to waste!    The octopus was another favorite as was the lavendar sugared marcona almonds. The suckling pig's skin was so crisp, and the flavors were perfectly spot on and tender. The tuna tartare was another favorite and frankly, you can never go wrong with an order of Potatoes Bravas at a Spanish restaurant and this was no exception.  For dessert we tried 2 of the 3 available choices - I'm not a fan of sabayon and after I described to my colleagues how it was made, there was unanimous agreement to instead try the Creme Catalina plus the Churros. To my surprise, I really liked the Churros - the cinnamon dusting on it wasn't at all aggressive but the Creme Catalina is what I would order again next time and then not share!  Really lovely evening out but if it came back to a choice, I'd go back to Cure before coming back to Morcilla!  PS - it was only after I uploaded pics that I realized my review failed to mention the cauliflower and mushroom with egg dish! Guess they weren't that memorable even tho' I recall liking the mushrooms!  Yelp Review 58/2017"}
{"text":"After visiting our son, who was living in Barcelona, I became a fan of the many flavors and textures that could be offered by the mini-meal tapas! The food was market fresh and wonderful there. Justin Servino and staff bring that same freshness and creative cooking to Pgh. The tapas were very very good, my wife and I shared a variety of tastings. Then we decided to share an entree'. We ordered a rack of BBQ ribs. I was blown away! I don't know what I was expecting, but at first taste eyebrows arched, eyes widely opened, jaw dropped! Never had I tasted ribs like this, I can't even describe the savory & sweet sauce adequately. The ribs melted in your mouth. I certainly hope that they stay on the menu, I know how Justin likes to keep a menu moving from one thing to another, but this was a keeper. I am thankful Justin is in Pgh, that he left Monterey Calif, and other Cali locations, this is where he belongs stoking our foodie world."}
{"text":"Wow! One of the best Pittsburgh has to offer. The chorizo and goat cheese are amazing. The octopus plate was the best."}
{"text":"The food is great, in addition to what was already mentioned, I was blown away by chicken wings. The design of place is very cozy. The drinks were tasty except red sangria, which did not have much flavor"}
{"text":"This dinner was a great moment in history, (personally), haha. We went in December so it may have to do with the season but the atmosphere felt warm and comfortable. It felt like a ski chalet with the dim lights and beams. There was no brushed nickel or repurposed wood as far as I could tell, which I found to be refreshing.   The meal was incredibly good. I might be intimidated by the menu on my own but the server was so knowledgeable and helpful that we just let her guide us and everything fell together perfectly. The charcuterie plate was so flavorful. There was some nutty meat, chorizo, blood sausage with dates and blue or Gorgonzola cheese. The almonds were fantastic; I ate nearly half the bowl. Ooohhh!!! There was an egg something or other, a frittata maybe? Finally, we ended with a suckling pig with the crispest skin and pork that melted in my mouth.   I'd eat pretty much anything this guy makes. Great experience. They're really doing something special there. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Always a favorite go to restaurant. The salmon stuffed with shrimp and crab was so tender and moist. Also come on an empty stomach big portions and they keep you a lot."}
{"text":"It was great to find a tapas restaurant that isn't obsessed with the concept of small plates and sharing. Morcilla is a Spanish restaurant, so it just is what it is--no explanation needed.  All of the items are delicious, including the eponymous pork blood sausage, and reasonably priced so that 3-5 items will cost no more than you'd pay for an entree.  Beef tartare, boquerones, and pickled vegetables were just some of the highlights.  The bar makes great cocktails, if a little too sweet.  Service is excellent; the staff were very helpful with my allergies.  Buen apetito!"}
{"text":"We had a great first experience at Morcilla! I was anxiously awaiting our date night reservation, but there were some empty tables on a Sunday evening so you may be able to get in without one. I eat seafood but not meat (fiance does but he doesn't eat cheese); we still found plenty to try. Between the two of us, we had a carafe of wine, one pinxto, one montadito, three plates, and dessert. I felt like this was plenty and left full. The price points are a good guide to the size of the dish, but even the small plates were rich. I appreciated having fair priced house wine because I expected that would be pricier (I think it was $17 for a carafe giving about 2 glasses each). Here's what we tried:  Bacalao en aceite--I really liked this, it came with three crostini and a bowl with several pieces of fish. Overall very delicious, I liked the caper and fried garlic accents.   Morcilla sausage--I didn't eat this, but my fiance was very happy with it.  Churro de cangrejo y estragon--This was actually the one thing we found a little disappointing. I saw a lot of people raved about this on here, but it seemed light on the crab. It mostly tasted like fried dough with a cheese sauce. I still liked it, but it didn't meet expectations.      Pulpo Escabeche--Soooo good! I had never tried octopus but was feeling adventurous, and I'm so happy I went for it. The potato and sauce complemented it perfectly. I can't wait to come back and have this again!  Champinones a la plancha--If you like mushrooms, you will enjoy this. They had a nice hearty flavor.   Churros--Obvious choice for dessert, delicious chocolate sauce. They did seem a little underdone in the middle, but it didn't bother me.   The service was wonderful, very professional but not overbearing. My water was always refilled and empty plates were cleared promptly. It's a casual atmosphere (many diners were wearing shorts) yet refined food and service. The pace of the meal was also well timed. Our two smaller dishes came out very quickly, which worried me it might go too fast, but the rest of the courses had appropriate breaks in between. Yes, it is a pricier night out, but it's a unique Pittsburgh dining experience and well worth it in my opinion. I'm looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I went on opening night and figured there would be service issues with a new staff....We were wrong! The staff was wonderful, the food was even better!  The only MINOR complaint I had (and it couldn't be helped) was that the paint fumes in the ladies room were so strong, I couldn't take it. I'm sure is gone by now. Other than that, it was a great dinner and experience. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place was so hard to get a reservation at!  We booked it 2 weeks in advance for 3 people but the only time available was 4pm on a Saturday.  When we arrived we were seated immediately and the service was prompt and friendly.  I love the cozy feel of the restaurant and the cured meat hanging over the bar, as well as the open windows in the front of the restaurant.  The back of the restaurant is a little dark but cozy with a nice ambiance.  We started with the large charcuterie platter that had samples of all the meats.  It was a perfect size for 3 people, but a little pricey for $50.  The meats were all excellent but I wish it had some cheese options to accompany it too.  We tried several of the tapas as well and my favorite was the wild mushrooms with the raw egg that you mix together.  That was fantastic!  Everything was very good, but I felt the prices were rather high for the size of the portions.  For example, I ordered one of the shrimp tapas and it only came with one shrimp :(  It was a large shrimp but still.  Tapas are usually meant to be shared and that is hard to do with one shrimp.  We also sampled some of the cocktails and those were excellent and at typical Pittsburgh high end cocktail prices.  They have a focus on gins which nice for a change, since it seems like every other place in Pittsburgh is focusing on Whiskeys and Bourbons now."}
{"text":"Unreal experience!  Cured meat there was the best I've ever had !  Imported hard cider was great.  Atmosphere and service was as good as it gets.  Gem of Pittsburgh !"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, and wonderful food and drinks. A must visit when you're in Pittsburgh!  Pros: -The food!         Pigs feet and Cheeks: a very interesting dish rich in flavor and texture        Bacalao En Aceite: Salt cod w/fried garlic and olive oil. A bit salty but our waiter gave us    extra bread to eat it with. The garlic and capers added a lot to the dish! Very nice starter.         Oxtail: Caramelized onion and mahon cheese. Delicious! So tender and flavorful.         Chorizo: housemade with great pairings. My SO loved this dish! -An incredibly knowledgable waiter! -Great ambiance -Solid non-alcoholic drinks -Decently priced     Cons:  -No differentiation between lunch and dinner menu/prices -Wouldn't get again:          Strawberry gazpacho: An interesting mix of balsamic and pureed strawberries, but not something I'd like to eat in a soup form. It was too vinegary and overwhelming. Our waiter took it off our bill for us."}
{"text":"Pro: - amazing Spanish tapas - patient and accommodating staff - the great selection of beers and wines - unique atmosphere  Con: - expect lines - a little bit crowded"}
{"text":"We were really hoping for the best and nope.  Oxtail wonderful.    Both of us got the pork loin with clams based on visit to Portugal we took a month ago.    For $26 each plate.  Sprouts burned not Carmelized. Pork way way too fatty and most of it ended back in my plate because couldn't  eat it. Other was tough and also burned.    I'm surprised at the other reviews to be honest."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been dying to try this place and it delivered. We had an early reservation and were seated immediately. He had the strip steak, I had the black cod, and my mom had the duck leg. Portion size was perfect. I had the hardest time deciding what plate I wanted they all sounded so good. We also had the bruchetta. Foies gras and sobrasada (spelling ?¿) were exquisite as were the coffees and aperitif cocktails. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. The staff and manager were very attentive. So much flavor in everything we tried. This place is a must, will be coming back many times in the future"}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night (reservations were for 9:30pm).  We arrived early and had a drink at the bar prior to being seated.  They advised us that they would transfer our drinks to our table tab when our table was ready which is a nice bonus in service.  I tried the Sidra.  Different and definitely worth the taste especially since they have a special tap.  Once seated we looked at the menu and had trouble deciding which things to try.  Our waiter was well versed in the menu and initially guided us towards some safer menu items.  After discussions and initial orders, he helped us pick some more interesting choices.  My boyfriend and I tried 8 items on the menu.  Our favorites were the Morcilla Sausage, Oxtail and Octopus dishes.    Service was great and seems to be team oriented.  Will definitely being going back."}
{"text":"A very rustic, hipster, dim-light dining Spanish ambiance, with delicious food. Great for a date spot and intimate dining. This is a gem for Pittsburgh locals who have never been to Spain to experience Spanish tapas and food."}
{"text":"Great food but dessert is definitely not their forte. Tables are too close to each other so it is hard to squeeze and it is not private. This used to be a great place a few years ago when it opened, price has considerably gone up with the hype. A few dishes are great but, as Spaniard, they mess up others--iberic ham for example was too thick, which is a waste of the product. Frozen crema catalana for dessert is not good (it shouldnt be frozen!). Probably the best Spanish restauranr in town but still lots to learn and improve"}
{"text":"Extremely overrated restaurant.   Good:  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was good.  Gazpacho was great.  Bad:  Everything else, especially the food.  We ordered 7 dishes. Peppers were horribly spicy but not labeled as such.  Meats were way too fatty.  Drinks were mediocre at best.    Would not recommend.  Far better meals on the area."}
{"text":"We love the food at both Cure and Morcilla but find it difficult to understand how both restaurants can be so meticulous and sophisticated with their food preparation but so random and raw with their music. We appreciate the potential for music helping to establish atmosphere, but it should enhance the experience rather than detract.  In both restaurants the music selections were random and the volume so loud that natural conversation across the table was impossible. Be good to all the senses - match your music selections and volume with the quality of your food and you will be more deserving of the reputation as Pittsburgh's best."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh is old. It's a dying city stuck in the rust belt. Some may say Pittsburgh is on the rise. I say it's risen, and Morcilla proves emblematic of Pittsburgh's Phoenix-like return.   Morcilla crafts decadent meals that satisfy both the palette and the wallet. From the Lamb Meatballs to the date-soaked Chorizo, you'll be drooling over each bite.   Your evening dinner decision has been made for you. Go to Morcilla and don't look back."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I were very excited to try this place tonight and came away more excited to go back.  Soon.  Having been to San Sebastian in the past and experiencing the unique concept of pintxos - very small, delicious plates combining foods that don't maybe sound like they should go together - it is clear that, absent a lot of thought and attention, this is an incredibly tough thing to pull off.  They succeeded, to say the least.    The atmosphere is cool and quaint.  The waitstaff was attentive and informative.  The manager and the owner both checked in on us during our meal.  And the food was tremendous - in concept, flavor, and presentation. We didn't even get to sample any of the large plates as we loaded up on pintxos and other smaller items (about 10 in total!) and our only regret was that we got filled up and couldn't try the whole menu - we plan to in the near future.  I previously lived in New York and San Francisco and I would put this up against any similar restaurant in either of those food meccas.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Not surprisingly, (We are big fans of Cure!) Morcilla delivers on every front! Creatively conceived, superbly prepared, mindfully sourced food. Great decor. Friendly, helpful, informative and very attentive staff. Having just visited Spain in October, this restaurant took us back, just for a little while! We shared tapas with our friends (just as we did in Spain), and every bite was on point! Especially loved the oxtail montadito and Garbanzos en piperade, but there was nothing lackluster about any dish we tried (or saw!). Amazing, predictably well executed establishment that we will make the drive to visit again very soon!"}
{"text":"Last night four of us dined at Morcilla. Décor, ambience and service were all excellent. The drinks were great and I had the best mocktail I've had in Pittsburgh, yet. I wasn't sure what to expect as I do not really like Cure. I never felt like the flavors worked well together. Well, Justin Severino has figured it out. Morcilla is a slam dunk and my new contender for top restaurant in Pittsburgh. Here's what we ordered. Jamon iberico- to die for. This is THE delicacy in Spain so very appropriate that it was on the menu. Oxtail- to die for; Beef tartare- exploding with flavor; smoked pork conserva with pickled shrimp- the unexpected start of the evening;  queso de cabra- the whole table was swooning over the smoked goat cheese; bakalao, just the technique of this dish was ridiculous, the fish, the sauces, the flavors, a must-order; pig's feet and cheeks- great- toted as the best egg roll ever; pulpo- we got 2 orders, the first was cooked perfectly, the second was too tough. Also, the cream on the dish was too heavy, although the potato was delicious. I'd re-work this dish a bit. Duck leg was not a stand out either. Duck was a little tough and I thought the accompaniments to the dish, while great individually didn't really work together. We split the suckling pig which was outstanding. 4 great sauces, pickled vegetables and it filled us right up. Definitely recommend it when you have a table of more than 2. Morcilla is more expensive that other restaurants in Pittsburgh but well worth it. We all can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I could not wait for this restaurant to open and it did not disappoint! The atmosphere was nice and our waitress Madeleine was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. We absolutely loved the food, especially the pintxos! I would definitely recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Morcilla is, perhaps unsurprisingly given the quality of the food at Cure, definitely the best tapas restaurant in Pittsburgh. It has a very authentic atmosphere and reminds me of bars/restaurants in Spain, from the hanging hams to the bar-top display of tapas.  As this is a tapas restaurant, the menu is dominated by snacks (Pintxos, Montaditos, and Croquetas). Every snack I have tried here, across multiple visits, has been absolutely delicious. My favorites are the oxtail and jamon. Some reviewers have complained about being surprised by the price-to-quantity ratio of these snacks. I encourage you to look at the tapas that are on display on the bar as you enter the restaurant... this will give you a sense of the quantity of food you are getting, and you can decide which ones are worth it to you. They may not be huge, but the snacks I have tried are rich and delicious and worth it.  Then there are small plates to share. I haven't tried any of these yet, but they look great!  Finally, there are big platters that are meant to be shared (and commonly are combined with snacks and small plates). I tried the ribs platter on my first visit here. They were good, but not mind-blowing. I think we expected something a little more unique from a place like this, considering how inventive and amazing our experiences at Cure had been in the past.  In the one full dinner I've had here, we had churros for dessert. The sauce is delicious and the flavor of the churros was fine, but they were so thin!  I was expecting more substantive ones, based on my most recent experiences in Barcelona.  Not sure I would order this for dessert again.  Although the restaurant is usually pretty busy and advance reservations are necessary on many nights, the bar is first-come, first-serve and often has space. You can order any of the snacks to enjoy at the bar. I love that you can stop in on a whim and order a drink and a snack or two. It is such a luxury to have this new joint right down the block!"}
{"text":"This place is so popular that on a Sunday night the best time we could get (on short notice) was 5 pm on Open Table. Great tastes on everything. The gazpacho soup with some intriguing unexpected flavors was so good I ordered it twice. Great service. With a house tempranillo, our whole bill came to $106 plus tax and tip -- a great deal for one of most respected restaurants in Pittsburgh. There were so many intriguing dishes that we could have come back a second night and ordered a whole new set of tapas."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience last night at Morcilla.  The setting was beautiful.  The chandeliers are wrought iron, and the wooden walls make a cozy setting.  The service was really wonderful.  Our server was super helpful with the menu, and attentive.  We were a large party and ordered a bunch of dishes to share.  Highlights include the pulpo, the ribs, the pig feet/head croquetas, bacalao and of course the churros.  Really enjoyed our dinner there last night and looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't get enough buzz in the burgh. I tried the opening dinner at cure and hadn't tried the actual restaurant until now. Not disappointed. It may have been the best small plate dinner we've had in a while... we ordered the oysters. They came with a fantastic ramp mignonette to compliment the buttery, slippery oyster. Superb. The next dish was tuna crudo with fresh peaches and salty crunchy mushrooms, with a sprinkling of some sprout like green herb and a chile oil.... so good. You should order it. The tuna was fresh and buttery, peaches were tart and sweet. We tried the octopus based on a review on yelp that mentioned how tender the octopus was. I tried octopus a few other places and was totally let down :::cough,cough, Tako:::::it's always been so rubbery and flavorless. This 'pus came with yogurt, dill, cucumber, nuts and was probably favorite of the evening. The last dish was the pork belly with peaches and some type of fruit compote. It was crispy, fresh, and amazing. We got the guell something and the menasco? Sour? The sour tasted like wine on the top, sour on the bottom. The guell tasted like a Spanish twist on Italian spritz... like soda water with some bitters and wine. Everything was great, can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at sister restaurant 'Cure' last night, was so good that I had to try Morcilla. Wonderful food! Portions were perfect size and allowed to try a bunch of different things on the menu (which I love).   Favorite Dishes: - Chorizo (fantastic combination of sweet and spicy) - Matrimonio - Pigs Feet and Cheeks (so flavorful)"}
{"text":"I researched my restaurants carefully before going to Pittsburgh. Morcilla seemed  like a place that I just couldn't miss. Located in the trendy Lawrenceville, it boasts an outstanding menu of savory tapas. I went with my friend for brunch. It was hard to decide between brunch and dinner but brunch is very reasonably priced. We each ordered the eggs Benedict with Iberia ham as a buttery hollandaise. It is a meal I will never forget.  The dish was perfectly balanced with smokiness and sweetness with the savory hollandaise in between. Every bite was fantastic. I will be back, and you should go too."}
{"text":"Another welcome addition to the restaurant scene in the Burgh.  Cool place.  Nice to have some Spanish cuisine.  There are mostly highlights but a few minor things that I am sure will evolve since only open a week or so.  We stopped in for a drink and some small plates. The bar is a stand up bar and limits orders from the menus of small plates, just what we wanted to try.  Morcilla cures meats in house so we decided to give them a try.  There is a small case of the many of the menu items on display at the end of bar.  The bar staff was good and friendly.  It was nice to be able to talk with the staff while they mixed sangria and some interesting drinks. We tasted a few of the wines available as a 2 oz. pour.  Not real familiar with some of the Spanish wines, so asked the bar staff for some info on a couple of the wines.  While they were helpful, I think a little more info/description would be helpful.  One was compared to a french wine but did not get a real description.  I would think this will change over time, but a little more of a description would be helpful. One of the wines tasted was probably open overnight and seemed to be a little oxidized but was drinkable.  The others were quite good. We had a couple of the Montaditos (sandwiches), the  Matrimony was terrific, the beef tartare was good but it probably had just a little to much aiolo, The Cecina of cured dried beef  and the Morcilla sausage were both excellent.    The menu includes some Jamon and seafood that we did not get to try, but will definitely come back to sample.  Will have to stop in with more time and have a dinner, too,"}
{"text":"What a gem! Lawrenceville has no shortage of good restaurants, this included. Great service from Sara since we dined and drank at the bar. Friendly, trendy scene here so space was at a premium.   What we ate.. many things. Luckily there were 4 of us so we tasted all around the menu.  Bacalao montadito, Marcona almonds with lavender salt, Serrano ham, warm bread with olive oil,, mesclun greens with strawberry vinaigrette and shall I go on! Each bite was truly delicious. Enjoyed the herbaceous sparkling sangria and the dramatically poured txacholina (rose and white, preferred white). The have 2 dessert; both great but the frozen creme catalan was the winner. Really enjoyed our time with friends here."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  We are literally still sitting at the. Table waiting on our 3rd tapas, it's been 50 minutes since we have sat down. Our drinks are empty. It's not a large place and more than one table is empty. I've been to Spain, they do not eat THIS slowly. Also feel that our server should've given us the talk on portion size that I can now hear our neighbors receiving.  Will not be back. In fact we are not ordering anything else.  Be advised even the \"plates\" are maybe three bites and it will take a good 45 minutes to receive it. If you do eat here, do not come hungry and order many things at once.  Or make sure your server discloses the specifics of the dining experience.  Or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great food and even better atmosphere. Try at least one item from every section and split the pork or chicken course!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am from Spain so my standards might be higher than normal but I still feel it fell way short for a Spanish restaurant. Both on food and drinks. We ordered the tomato bread and only 1 slice of bread came out. Only 1 slice. Really??? It is bread and tomato. And you only bring out 1 piece of bread? For that price? The ham croquettes so stale and tiny we had to ask them to please substitute them (which they did at no charge, so that was good). We suggested to go with the Spanish omelette instead and was advice to go with something else as their version would not be what a Spaniard knew as such. Ok? We went with a montadito which again, for 2 people, came just as 1 piece of bread montadito. It was good but the amount was so cheap. For drinks we ordered a Hendricks gintonic. Hendricks was nowhere to be found and we ended up leaving half of our drink as was pure soda. They also used what seemed to be black pepper vs pink pepper so the taste was overwhelming. Considering Barcelona is the new gintonic capital of the World it fell massively short for a true Spanish experience. Pros: service was excellent and the restaurant is very nice."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant! We had dinner at Morcilla last night and it was exceptional! I ordered the white sangria and it was unlike any sangria I have had before. It had a lovely floral taste and was not very sweet, but it was delicious, refreshing, and garnished beautifully! Because I have always wanted to tracks to Spain to eat authentic Spanish ham, I ordered both the Jamón ibérico and the Surryanyo Ham. The ibérico is pricy, but WELL WORTH THE MONEY!! I have never tasted anything like it! if you LOVE ham, then I say GET THAT HAM!!!   I also ordered the chorizo, leek, and potato stew, and shared the blistered leek and romanesco dish. Everything was spectacular! My husband (a vegetarian who understands my love of cured meats) ordered a couple of fried croquettes that he said were delicious. I am not sure what they were because I was too enamored with my ham to pay attention to anything else.  The service is great and the atmosphere is comfortable but still has that fine I dining feel. I really like it when I can go and have a good meal but feel comfortable as well.   In closing I would like to leave you with this advice about this wonderful restaurant: GET THAT HAM!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love it.  I truly did.  The atmosphere was small and cozy, a tad on the dark side...it was tricky to read the menu.  There is a small bar at the front of the restaurant, but no seats, just standing room.  The waiter was very attentive and explained the menu in detail, and recommended 2-3 small plates and then perhaps an entree each.  I will say that each menu item I tried was delicious.  My complaint was that, $40 later, I was still hungry, and wishing I'd had more.  Having been to the sister restaurant Cure, I knew the quality of food would be superb, and it was.  I just was hoping that with a more casual atmosphere would have either some more casual prices or portions that left me feeling satisfied.  I would probably go back for a great glass of bourbon and a quick appetizer, but with all of the great dining options in town these days, unless they offer dinner sized entrees to accompany their dinner-sized prices, I will likely take a walk down the street for a full meal."}
{"text":"I have had 3 experiences at Morcilla (so far...I imagine there are MANY more in the future).  Every time I went I've tried new things, in addition to 'old' favorites.  I was an exchange student in Northern Spain many years ago, the memories this food brings back...  I have 2 favorite dishes, although I think a 3rd was added to that list last night.     My first choice when walking into Morcilla is the Churro De Cangrejo y Estragon - this is a MUST ORDER (if you don't have a shell fish allergy!).  It is so, absolutely, utterly amazing and scrumptious.  Order it.  You won't be disappointed.    My second favorite dish - Endive and goat cheese.  I got this my first 2 visits - but was bummed to not see it on the menu last night.  However - I appreciate that they change their menu according to the season (hello asparagus!)  The new addition to my favorite list - Chorizo.  Holy yum.  That's all I can say about it - YUM.  I've tried almost all the Montaditos and have absolutely no complaints.  I've tried most of the Croquetas as well.  I will say - personally - I'm not a fan of the Queso de cabra.  It has quite a strong smokey flavor, but that's just me.  My friend I was with last night loved it.  The wait staff has been great (other than the hiccup the first visit where our waiter would only talk to my friend who had been there, but not me - who had never visited....weirdo.)    They recently added Sangria Rosada.  I've tried all 3 sangria's and this is by far my favorite.   I will say I had one frustration in this last visit however.  (But it surely won't keep me from returning.  Many.  Many times)  I made reservations for 3 - but one of the members of the party ended up having a work event she couldn't get out of.  I wanted to try to find someone to take her place, so i didn't call immediately to let them know.  Wednesday when the hostess called to confirm our reservation - she questioned why I had not called to let them know the reservation had changed.  \"Good thing I called\".  That wasn't necessary.  You are the first face your patrons see/hear. I thanked her and moved on.  However, we were running late getting to our reservation last night, so I called to let them know we would be 5 minutes late.  (I'm not one to no show!) She wasn't too pleasant AGAIN!  \"Well I guess we can keep your table\".  Um...what?!  At least I had the courtesy to call!   Morcilla hasn't been open long - and I have visited 3 times and have additional upcoming reservations.  A \"hiccup\" in the hostess will not keep me from going as the rest of the wait staff is incredibly friend and helpful.   Thank you Morcilla for being you - I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Small storefront style building. Standing room only bar. Outstanding service. Interesting and flavorful selection of foods. The tapas are small plates and not really enough to share. They are delivered quickly, so dinner is easily done in 1-1.5 hours. The cocktail and wine selection is small, but those that are offered are very good. Two observations worth mentioning are that there very few seafood items on the menu and they need to improve the air conditioning."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, some of my friends assume that if I choose a restaurant, it will be good, even if I've never been there before and have no real idea. Morcilla, thank you for allowing me to keep this reputation (although I cheated a little, I love Cure so I knew this was probably going to be good).  As soon as I walked in the door, something about the lighting and the decor made the restaurant seem cozy and cute.  Delicious looking pintxos lined the displays and hanging above us were huge blocks of meat. All of the food surrounding us made us even more excited to try the food.   We ordered a sampling of plates to share and each was quite good. Pigs feet and cheeks croquetas -- fried deliciousness. Basque butter lettuce salad -- an elevated take on Caesar salad, tasted fresh and good. Champignones a la plancha -- tasted almost like a tartare with that egg yolk mixed in, good. Pulpo -- haven't had a lot of octopus lately and this convinced me that I'm missing out, so good. The Costillas de la Mantanza -- a sweet, glazed plate of ribs; now maybe I'm biased because I love ribs, but these were probably my favorite!  We ended on the churros plate. The churros were dusted with a good heaping of sugar and a perfect blend of doughy and crispy. The chocolate was very dark and rich but I wish I could taste more hazelnut!  The short version of this review: Morcilla is great and you should go there. I love Cure, but I think I might love Morcilla even more!"}
{"text":"Ten months later and Morcilla is still blowing my mind - and my palette (see my original review on 2/15/2016 for more details). I will say that, this time, we sat near the kitchen in the back corner, which was super exciting for an amateur foodie chef like me. Also, even though Open Table said Morcilla was booked, we called and got a late night table. And, again, we ate all-of-the-things and had dessert and had a bottle of wine - and our bill was more than reasonable. Morcilla should be on the top of everyone's list for date night - or ANY night!"}
{"text":"Wow just wow. I had been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it featured in Bon Appetit's Hottest New Restaurants in 2016. Came here on a friday around 5 ish. It is a very cozy restaurant with warm lighting. Once we were seated, our server went through the menu telling us her favorites and recommendations. It was helpful as the menu can be a bit overwhelming and we just wanted to order everything.   We ended up ordering the fuet, chorizo, queso en aceite, bacalao, leeks a la parilla, the costillas de la matanza, and the crema catalana. First the queso en aceite came out and it was amazing. The warm bread dipped in the olive oil and marinated manchego was just delicious. Then the salami and chorizo came out. The salami had hints of garlic and was perfect with the toasted bread and pickled peppers. The chorizo took some getting used to as I had never had dates, blue cheese, and chorizo before. I definitely would love to come back to try the charcuterie platter of all the meats!  The bacalao was the only thing I didn't love although my friend thought it was great. The fish was shredded so it just had a weird consistency to me. Then the ribs and leek came out. The ribs were amazing. They were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The leek was also unique. Finally for dessert we had the crema catalana which was basically a frozen creme brûlée. It was a perfect way to end a wonderful meal.  Although the portions were not huge we were both still full. It was great sharing and trying a wide variety of dishes. I honestly liked coming earlier, because it wasn't as crowded yet. By the time we left it was very loud. I know though I will be back as their menu changes monthly!"}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary dinner. Bar was fun and drinks were unusual and tasted great. We were sat for our reservation and were blown away by the number of options there were on the menu. I would say about half of the items we ordered I would order again. The rest, we honestly were not a fan of. Overall, I would give this place another shot because of the atmosphere, a few good dishes, and its proximity to my house, but I'm not sure it lived up to the hype the first time around."}
{"text":"The best Sangria. Service is great.  Nice atmosphere.  I've dined here a couple times now and have enjoyed everything from the menu."}
{"text":"The food here is unbelievable. Spanish food is our favorite, we've traveled all over Spain and have been to the top spanish restaurants in NY- this beats them all. Every dish is unique and full of flavor. Make sure you make reservations, and try the oxtail!"}
{"text":"Great tapas restaurant. Service is always very good. Recommend getting a few small plates and an entree. Great wine variety."}
{"text":"I was thrilled when I learned that Morcilla now offers lunch on both Sat and Sun between 11-2 pm. I was anxious to try out the food from Chef Severino who also is the chef at Cure in Upper Lawrenceville.  Although I had made a reservation when I arrived the place was virtually empty so the hostess seated me immediately. As I walked past the bar area I noticed that the montaditos were encased for full viewing which would help me decide which one I wanted to try. Montaditos are various cured meat toppings on toasted bread.  My waiter helped me interpret the menu and told me about the more popular dishes. I wanted the main course of bacalao which is salted black cod that came with cauliflower catalan,and capers and other items. Since I wanted to try I dessert I opted for a lighter motaditio which was sobrasada. This item had spreadable smoked salami, with apple and hazelnut.   Since I love ice tea I was pleased when they offered me their version which is made with red rooibos, saffron, and caramel for flavoring. While I was waiting for my food I could see the hanging meat at the bar area. My food was served very quickly and I was told what it was upon presentation. The sobrasada was very spicy and had a smoked taste to it. I got my bacalao next. This meal was cooked to perfection good! It also had a bit of a smoked taste to it.  Portion sizes tend to be small but this is what I would expect in a higher end restaurant. I noticed that dress is very casual for lunch.The place has that Spanish feel about you.   After I had finished my main course I opted for dessert. For $9.00 you get a choice of either churros or frozen crema catalana. I chose the latter since my waiter explained that it would be like a frozen creme brulee on top of a pine nut cookie. It was so good I was scraping the sides to get every morsel of it!  Many of the meats that are served here are raw so please note that when ordering. It is also noted on the bottom of the menu.  When I completed my meal they allowed me to take the menu home to show my family for a future visit. The staff is both knowledgeable and professional. My waiter made me feel very welcome here.  This is definitely a place where you can run up a high tab if you're not careful, however, for me I usually like to frequent places like this for lunch over dinner since lunch prices tend to be a bit less. Morcilla is located in lower Lawrenceville. Metered street parking is available."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Hands down the best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Had many courses but some of the highlights were the Tuna Crudo, Jamon Con Queso and Morcialla blood sausage. Sarah, our very knowledgeable server, lead us down an amazing food experience. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice selection. We had a tapas meal where they brought 8 dishes over 4 stages. I really liked the octopus and the cocktails were good. We had good service and our table was comfortable. I don't think it lives up to all the hype (no reason you should need a reservation so far in advance) but definitely a nice meal."}
{"text":"Great tapas, we ordered over a dozen different ones. The tartare was the best tartare I've ever had. We also had a few of the main dishes as well as the jaberico. The octopus was nice, but not fantastic. Sadly the wines on tap were out for the season, so we had cocktails, in all a nice experience. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about the dishes. They didn't have the suckling pig entrée which is why we went all the way out to Lawrenceville, so they miss a star for lack of the delicious baby pig and wine."}
{"text":"I had a fantastic experience at Morcilla. I met a couple of friends for dinner here on Friday night, as I was moving out of Pittsburgh the next day and wanted to eat somewhere special for my last meal in the 'burgh. Given all of the great things I had been hearing about Morcilla, I made a reservation--and it did not disappoint!  The menu is broken down into a few categories depending on the type and size of the dish. Some items consist of just a few bites, then there are some larger plates, and even a few platters meant to be shared by the table. My friends and I took the approach of ordering a bunch of items and sharing/tasting them all. We were a little unsure of how much to order, but our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable.  A few favorites were the beef tartare (on crusty, thin bread with cured egg yolk and vegetable escabeche--basically pickled veggies), the salt cod with crispy capers, fried garlic chips, and lemon, and also the lamb meatballs with with raisins, sumac, and leek. The tartare was possibly the best I've ever had, and was absolutely packed with flavor. The lamb meatballs were juicy and also full of flavor, and the sumac yogurt was a fantastic pairing. I also enjoyed the chorizo with crispy potato and brandied prune. The thick prune sauce was unique and a flavor combination that really stood out to me. While some items definitely stood out, everything was enjoyable and I loved the ability to experience so many different ingredients, textures, and flavors in one meal.  The service was also great. Dishes were brought out with timing in mind, so at no point were there more than two or three items on the table. Each dish was also explained as it arrived, which was also helpful since it's easy to forget exactly what was ordered when it comes to small plates.  It's also reasonably priced, especially given the quality--for ten menu items and three cocktails, our total bill (for three people) came to just under $100. Overall I really enjoyed this meal and would love to return whenever I'm in Pittsburgh visiting."}
{"text":"We've been several times at Cure and we loved it, so now we were dreaming of tasting new Justin Severino's tapas restaurant. Last night was the night!!  Once I was inside, was love at first sight: the counter with some pintxos, the tapas menu written as the Spanish way and, most important, see those ham legs hanging up at the counter area was such a familiar feeling... He nailed it!!! AMAZING, these tapas with a Severino's twist were soooo special. The best one for me?? The oxtail montadito was one of the best I have ever taste in my life ( and as a Spanish girl I've tasted many tapas in my life). And the croquetas, specially the bacalao (cod) one was incredible!! The way he prepared the cured meat...awesome, as usual. Of course, there were other ones that weren't so special for me and I have told him too, as a constructive comment (sorry if I bothered you with my suggestions, Justin Severino). This is a great place to discover, definitely. Congrats to this brave chef and his team and all the best for them. They really deserve it!"}
{"text":"Morcilla is a restaurant of inconsistent extremes at least for brunch. The food was either very good (champinones a la plancha, Greek salad) or completely meh ( dry manchego biscuits, French press coffee, beet juice) or sounded better on the menu than it tasted like the lamb sausage. I wish Morcilla the best of luck, but on my next visit to Pittsburgh, I'll pass on coming here again."}
{"text":"Really great addition to the food scene in PIttsburgh.  I was delighted to see wait staff from some of my favorite restaurants who have migrated over to Morcilla--the service is excellent because of the team they have assembled.  Space is great--even when crowded it doesn't get too noisy.  Small plates are all good and the house-smoked meats are fantastic.  Great tapas and a cool place to take folks out for dinner.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Was on a trip in Pittsburgh ate break dead lunch and dinner at \"the best\" restaurants. This was number #1."}
{"text":"Morcilla was incredible! We came for a 7pm reservation on Saturday and the place was packed. We ended up having to wait another half an hour for our table, but grabbed some seats at the bar and had a drink while we waited. I had a white sangria, which wasn't too sweet and came garnished beautifully with different fruits.   We ordered seven plates total, which ended up being too much for two people, but we just couldn't decide! Started out with the tuna crudo, sopressata, the jamon iberico (which is claimed to be one of the best hams in the world), and a roasted pepper dish. The tuna crudo was phenomenal, with so many contrasts of flavors. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The jamon iberico was also very good, although I don't know if I would pay the steep price for it again. I also enjoyed the sopressata and roasted peppers, but they didn't stand out as much as the other dishes we had.   Next, we had the mushrooms, ribs, and octopus. These were all absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend them all. The mushrooms in particular were so rich, and the egg yolk mixed in with them added a depth of flavor and creaminess. The ribs were fall off the bone tender but crispy on the outside, with a really yummy sauce. I also loved the octopus - it was cooked perfectly and wasn't chewy at all.   Service was attentive even though they were pretty busy. They staggered bringing out the dishes so that we had enough time to enjoy each one, and we never felt rushed. Morcilla was one of the best dining experiences that I've had in Pittsburgh, definitely give it a try if you can!"}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious, portion sizes were plentiful, and the ambiance is great. I do not even like meat, but the people I went with do and raves about the meat dishes. I liked the Seafood and vegetarian options so much. I don't live in Pittsburgh but will be coming back to Morcilla whenever I come back. I enjoyed the wine selection and the attentive/ knowledgeable staff. It was a pleasure to dine here."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to come here for a while now after being pregnant for what seems like forever, I wasn't going to come here and not eat all the meats! And all the meats I did eat... including seafood as well!  Honestly thinking about the seafood, I almost enjoyed the seafood the most. We had a fantastic Bacalao cod dish that was reminiscent of the Italian baccala dish I love, but a Spanish version. I also loved the octopus, which was grilled to perfection. An unexpected and maybe favorite dish was the fresh tuna crudo with delicious peaches. It was such a great summer dish.   We ordered a huge charcuterie board with literally all the meats on the menu. I'd imagine we had about 10 meats on the tray. They were all fab, but my favorite was probably the Sherry Pork Salami. Full disclosure, we had a group of 6 people... So we may have over ordered too much food! By the time our last dishes came, we were all pretty full! Our last dish was the wings, which I did enjoy, but again, it was the last dish and we were stuffed!  A couple of the sides I loved too were the pickled carrots and the heirloom tomato gazpacho... Which is a huge bowl and maybe not the smartest thing to order with a ton of other foods, because it was so much food!   The environment was great though with dim lighting and a Spanish vibe. I'd probably come to the bar and order some snacks and a wonderful glass of rose again!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food, lovely attention to detail. Excellent quality and knowledgeable staff that went above standard. I took one star off because it was very loud, I had to basically scream across my table to talk to my boyfriend. But then again, alot of people speak of your success! So I'm happy for you!"}
{"text":"Here is a list of things I love about Morcilla:  1. The food. This is a good thing to love at a restaurant. Morcilla offers some of my favorite things, including beautiful beets, exceptional ribs, perfectly cooked seafood, and all the charcuterie including spreadable salami and a surprise star, the Cecina. This cured beef upstaged a lot of the pork (as we all know, the finest meat to cure) with it's roasted pepper conserva. Plus it all looks damn good, in addition to being tasty.  2. The bar program. I could drink the Piel de Sapo for the rest of my life, and the other cocktails I tried were nearly as good. Toss in some great sangria, the best sherry selection I may have ever seen, and the awesome and insane cider pour thingy (technical term) happening at the front of the bar, and there's nothing not to love.  3. The service. We almost always sit at the bar, and there's very few places where that's a better call. The bartenders know their biz, make great recommendations, and are just generally pleasant people to be around.  That's it. That's all you need to get me in here."}
{"text":"Cure's Rockstar Chef Justin Severino has struck lightning a second time, with Morcilla.    Even though most of the tapas are just a few bites, they're extremely diverse and intensely flavorful.  It's worth going with friends, and trying and sharing nibbles of everything.  The staff was attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable about the menu, happy to discuss the differences between exotic dishes.  Quality ranged from extremely good all the way up to Transcendent with a capital T.  The following were some of the tastiest dishes we'd ever eaten.  The freshness, textures, and symphonic flavor compositions were perfection given physical form.    Beef Tartare  Foie Gras  Smoked Pork Conserva  Lamb en Moreno  My parents recently ate their way through Spain, and said Morcilla's spanish tapas cuisine was better than anything they had in Spain!  When you first walk in, you see the pigs hanging from the ceiling of the butcher bar, a fitting metaphor for the angelic flavors that could only come from pigs that fly."}
{"text":"Absolute fantastic dinner!! My partner and I came here on a Thursday evening (no trouble getting a reservation online). Even though I don't eat meat (I came here once before when I did used to eat meat and it was divine as well), there were a ton of options on the menu -it did help that I do eat fish though.   My partner and I started off with a tuna dish -poke-like tuna, with peaches, a saffron chili oil, microgreens and wonderful fried shiitake mushrooms. We then ordered the ox-tail (for him), the most recent octopus dish, and championones a la plancha (mushrooms). WOW. The octopus and mushroom dishes were definitely our favorites. The octopus is cooked perfectly and served alongside chickpeas that are pickled and then rolled in (a spice that I cannot remember). Mushrooms were mixed together with an egg yolk -the flavor was definitely a little heavy but insanely delicious, especially when you topped the bread with it. All the dishes (save for the platters) are tapas-sized. We ordered 4 dishes, which was the perfect amount for us to enjoy dinner and still get dessert.  For dessert, we ordered the churros and frozen crema catalana. The chocolate/hazelnut sauce that came with the churros was the perfect amount of bitterness (great chocolate). The crema catalana we had was a simple vanilla and maple flavor. Again, delicious, a bit lighter than a creme brulee. Overall, the meal was fantastic. As for the actual setting, the tables are a bit close together and lighting is a bit dim, so it's definitely better for a more intimate dinner. The service was fantastic -Sara(h) recommended us fantastic wines to go along with our dishes."}
{"text":"Food flavors were delicious. Service was outstanding. Drinks and wine were excellent. The richness of the food was relentless, too much so."}
{"text":"Nationally recognized. Award winning. Best new restaurant. With such high expectations, Morcilla was bound to disappoint, right? Wrong. For all you Spain lovers, Morcilla is the place where you can recreate the classic long, late dinner, savoring good food + wine (on draft!) and engaging in lively banter with close friends 'n family. It's worth trying at least one charcuterie selection...a highlight for us being the housemade Fuet. The imported Serrano Ham was another delectable delight. From the dozen tapas we sampled, the faves included Pork Belly, Scallops a la Plancha, Mussels, and Patatas Bravas. Were there disappointments? Croquetas de Jamon and Ribs fell a bit short, but overall the accolades are well deserved. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and personable as well. A return visit will have to wait for a special occasion for sure."}
{"text":"We've been waiting patiently for this place to open and finally went for dinner!   First, the staff was all so helpful and kind. Our server was so pleasant and answered all of our many questions. She took the time to briefly explain all of the cocktails and wine to us so we could make a great choice. I also loved the coat check they had at the host stand. The person who seemed to be the manager came around at the end to check on us and ask about our meal and it was appreciated.   Second, I loved the inside of the space. It's small but comfortable. I appreciate the bar area without stools where you are free to stand and have a drink and small plate. A lot of great little touches on the decor and presentation   Last, the food! I cannot even list everything we ordered because with four people, we ordered about 10-15 smaller options and then two large plates and shared everything. Some favorite small options were the crab and tarragon churros, the bacalao, and the jamon croquetas. Everything we had was good and full of flavor. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I don't feel like I'm racing to make another reservation. We tried a good portion of the menu, pretty much everything that sounded delicious to us, and it was good. But I'd love to see how often the menu will change or have rotating items to go back for new things!"}
{"text":"It was great... one of the best tapas I have ever tried. Raw fish with pomegranate was such a brilliant idea. Cherry jam with chicken liver is balanced!! Ham was typical Spanish one and whole fish with lemon is tender in texture and the fish skin is crispy."}
{"text":"Great every time! I am sad the tapas display case is gone from the front, but the food is still delicious! I always get the Spanish cider from the cool hand statue to start. The service is friendly, knowledgeable and timely. Always an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. We ate in the bar hightop without a reservation. We got lucky. Please make reservations.  Service was excellent, loved my drink that they made especially for me.  When we ordered three took into consideration how it was best to deliver the food and they made recommendations on what order to eat each course. Much appreciated.  The atmosphere is beautiful. Even care is taken in the restroom decor.  Eating here is like experiencing a fine symphony."}
{"text":"Visited a few weeks ago with my husband. Everything I tried was great. The meats were all wonderful (as I'd expected). My favorite dish was the octopus.   My only complaint is that there was no bread. I'm used to tapas restaurants having tomato bread and there wasn't any bread in sight on the menu."}
