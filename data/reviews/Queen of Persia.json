{"text":"a wonderful retreat from city life.  Beautiful artwork on the walls and attractive Iranian d√©cor and table ware. the food was delicately fragrant and delicious. The gracious owner stops by each table to greet every guest."}
{"text":"We live in neighborhood and we were looking forward for this place opening. We went there at a weekend and it was full of guests ( second time we went there during the week and it was not crowded ). The decoration is very nice, Lily , the owner came to our table several times to make sure everything is ok , and they kindly offered us extra rice when they noticed it is finished on our table... I had khoreshte ghormeh sabzi and khoreshte fesenjon  which were very delicious. 
Kababs were fantastic, specially Kabab Torsh.
I really recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We walked in for the ambiance and stayed for the food. Mouth watering kebabs and Fish in tamarind sauce. Even the home made pistachio swiss roll cake was to die for.
Lily the owner was very gracious and gave every patron her attention. Highly recommend this place both for the food and service."}
{"text":"My most favourit Persian restaurant among ones I have been. It has the best Kebab in Toronto. Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Friday (so incorrect actually that it says the restaurant is closed until 3). Wonderful atmosphere and food. Not sure of actual dish names as we asked for a recommendation, but I really liked the eggplant and egg appetizer as well as the beef/lamb kebab with rice. Coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to a number of Persian restos in Toronto -- there are quite a few, particularly in the Yonge/Steeles neighbourhood -- and this one has to be the best.
The food was fragrant, flavourful and tender. The rice was freshly cooked and fluffy. The kebabs -- koobideh (ground beef and lamb) and bolghari (tenderloin and chicken) -- were truly a standout. Seasoned so they had character and with flavours that were new to me but not overwhelming. Perfectly cooked. We also ordered a traditional Persian stew, Gheimeh, which opened my eyes to the possibilities of using french fries. 
Desserts were similarly well executed -- we ordered pomegranate and pistachio ice creams and a Persian specialty featuring a lime sorbet and rice noodles. The latter was interesting, though I probably wouldn't reorder. But on the whole this was a great culinary experience with most hospitable service!"}
{"text":"Superb middle Eastern food (best chicken ever), appetizers (fantastic yogurt and spinach, eggplant and tomato dips etc) to die for, huge portions beautifully arranged, vibrant (yet discreet) and wonderful ambience and decor, and most attentive (without ever appearing intrusive) service - this has become my (our) favourite place in the neighbourhood!  Lily the owner drops by to check on her guests; you just feel welcome here!"}
{"text":"Looks nice but quality of cooking very poor. Fish super greasy. for $27 I dont expect deep fried food.   meatballs fried as hard as rocks served with plain boring rice. Appetzer spread was tasty. Art on wall very funky and unique."}
{"text":"We live just around the corner, and have been looking forward to trying this place out since it opened a few months ago.  The food was delicious.  I had the ghormeh sabzi - kidney bean and beef stew, with a burst of dried lime.  Very rich and satisfying.  The saffron rice was good too.  I loved the hammered metal serving dishes and pretty glasses.  Lily, the owner, graciously came to check on our table and welcome us, which was nice.   Not a lot of options for vegetarians - and they weren't serving their vegetable kebab that night for some reason, which limited choices even further.  It wasn't too busy, so we were able to stay for a good long visit without feeling rushed at all.  Will definitely be back."}
