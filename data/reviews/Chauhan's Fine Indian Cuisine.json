{"text":"I attended a wedding event at Chauhan's in their banquet hall. The hall is rather dingy/rundown and the chaircovers were tied so haphazardly that I was mortified (I work in events and this is just a no-no!) I had to resist the urge to go around retying them!  We enjoyed some apps before the main event (the pakoras were AWESOME) and a buffet style meal. I ended up eating rice+naan because the chicken and beef dishes looked too oily and creamy for me to stomach. The naan was fantastic though!  I don't live in the area so won't be back anytime soon, but probably also wouldnt go out of my way to go if I did."}
{"text":"Great lovley food. Better to order fresh than trying the buffet. Naan and tandoori chicken is made right in front of yours in a corner room with a clear glass to see the chef in work. Place needs a cleanup."}
{"text":"Good: - butter chicken, naan, gulab, ice creams are good.   Bad: - Everything else except the food I've listed above.  Service:  -OMG OMG!!! what the heck is he doing? eEXTREMELY bad service  the man only came once which was to fill up water..never came after to refill them -did not take our used plates -my husband and i stood at the entrance for about 5 min watching him walk back and forth but never welcomed us or gave us a seat. -food had wrong \"names\"- my husband could not eat beef ..the sign said chicken so he took it and the light was dim&red light;/(was bad for my eyes when I looked at the meat which the red light was shining on) so we could not tell til we got to our seat  -man yelled at him for wasting food(really it was both mine&his combined so we can stack them) and threw the plate back down on the table -beef&mutton signs had the same meat - did not come to check if were okay during our meal -the only waiter was i guess the owner who didn't see us at the doorway and yelled at us  Food: - Nasty. - Mutton was so soft and mushy - Tandoori had \"meat blood\" very visible is every bite - Only had 3 typical flavours of icecream& gulab, slices of orange  Washroom: - Very stinky - Febreeze air sprays on the sink counter - No paper to dry hands  Restaurant overall: - Dirty - Plates already on the table had pieces of dirt of some kind which was covered with napkins - Table of 2 was very small  i advise you not to go there& i would never go there again."}
{"text":"Have been there a few times. Was introduced to the restaurant via the use of an Entertainment Book coupon, and liked. They do feature good appetizing, well prepared Indian Cuisine.  Their Vindaloo is truly superior, and their Mhurg terrific. It is an all around good place to enjoy your favorite Indian specialties.  The decor and ambiance are a bit 'dated' but the service is good. If you are a bit 'spice sensitive' please make sure that you request very mild items."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times a long while ago, and recently decided to give it another shot. The location has been home to North Indian cuisine for about twenty years now, what used to be Sangam Restaurant, has been home to Chauhan for about 10 years.   He used to be a chef at a huge restaurant in New Delhi, then part of the Host's team in Toronto (when it was located at the south east corner of Bay and Bloor in the late 90s). Since the break, Chauhan's specialized in Indian cuisine with a distinctly Punjabi taste a la Peel Region(a little oily and a little more spicy). Though, not my favourite and that's probably what kept me away for a few years. I'm pleased to say that he once again returned to his foundation of typical New Delhi-esque Indian cuisine.   On my visit here during lunch, I found the service quite decent and the waiter was courteous and all smiles, so kudos on the quality despite the thin staff.  Though the food is fantastic, fresh and inspiring, I would return more frequently if a bit more attention was paid to the presentation of the dishes in the buffet. It would make the already delicious items look miles more tantalizing.  3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"The food is pretty terrible, but it's fairly cheap. Naan was okay. Wont rate the service since it was a buffet."}
{"text":"The banquet hall looks nice, but the service is poor.  We recently held our son's christening party there, and when we went to visit the hall before the event, it appeared very nice.  However, on the day of the event, the chair covers were filthy.  Seeing as how you have to pay extra for chair covers, this was really aggravating.  The staff were very unresponsive and needed to be babysat.  For example, they didn't replenish the buffet when the food ran out; we had to keep asking them to do so.  Anytime we needed anything, we had to ask repeatedly before they did it.  We also felt cheated on the food.  For example, the palak paneer had barely any paneer in it.  The rasmalai was not the good stuff that they serve at the restaurant, but rather the cheap (and awful) canned variety.  Overall it was not a good experience and I would not use them for another event."}
{"text":"When I first entered the restaurant and looked at the menu, I thought \"wow these are downtown Toronto prices in Markham\".  I went here with family on a Sunday so the restaurant had very few people.  We started off with tandoori chops. The meat was succulent on the inside and well seasoned and marinated on the outside. Lamb is often overdone when grilled , but this was just right.  The assorted platter was really crisp and not too oil soaked.   We then got the karahi chicken. This was excellent as well. Often at some restaurants, being a semi dry dish , one can taste all the individual spicing that went in. Not so at this place, it was well seasoned and the chicken was well cooked without being overdone.  Our third dish was the navratan kurma. This was very rich and creamy with exotic spices. I am not usually the one in the group that goes \"that vegetarian dish was amazing\" but I did with this one. What I also liked was that each of the sauces was unique and didnt seem like the chef makes 3 sauces which he uses in everything (some indian places will do that).  When I left I no longer though the prices were too high for Markham, everyone in our group was happy with the meal and the service.  This is definitely among the best exemplars of Indian cuisine I have tried."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet on Sunday. Not sure if it was due to the weather or the day itself, it was quite empty. More seats to choose from !  From the outside it looks a tad run down so upon entering Chauhan, I was pleasantly surprised. The dining room is quite spacious and nice. The host was very friendly and even managed to crack quite a few jokes.   Food was a-ok. A little bland for me, but I suppose I could have brought hot sauce. For 2 buffets, we paid $25... this includes taxes AND tip.  Nothing to write home about, but if I'm in the area and am jonesing for Indian, why not?  Solid three stars."}
{"text":"So I was excited to give this place a try, and i was happy to see that a take away plate was only about $10. Then when I saw an aerosol bottle of RAID on the counter behind the bar; I felt sick. The man who worked there was so nice and friendly, but the food was tainted in my mind."}
{"text":"Another place where everything used to be amazing but now the food quality have gone down from amazing to good, service from amazing to bad and the restaurant itself from good to super dingy and disgusting.   Can't recommend this restaurant to anyone anymore."}
{"text":"Dark, musty smelling. Will never go again. Food was bland."}
{"text":"OMG - The absolute best Indian food I've ever ever had outside of India itself! And not just in the US, but other countries too!!!  This place just had the most perfect cooking and the most delicious food - ever!!! I've often considered driving up to Toronto from Chicago just to go eat at Chauhan's!!!  This place was just serving perfection in food!!! Please continue to do such an amazingly good job!"}
