{"text":"I was warned that there would be nothing for me to eat here besides the salad bar, but I figured that was an exaggeration - surely there must be some appetizer, composed salad, or pasta that wasn't full of meat on the regular menu. Nope, should have listened. Should have remembered I was in Toronto.  I figured that at least a $14.99 salad bar would have more than cold salads, bread and a soup - my last experience with salad bars being Sizzler at age 8 of course.   There's nothing terribly wrong with the salad bar offerings here - except that most people could make better things at home very easily for way less money. While there were plenty of beans and lentils, don't expect to feel satisfied if you are a vegetarian."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day last year.  The restaurant we wanted to go to did not take reservations for Mother's Day, so we decided to head to Sierra Grill for a Mother's Day brunch.  We ordered off of the menu.  The food was pretty good...I had a veggie omlette.  Can't remember what everyone else had...there was a big group of us and it was a yr. ago.  The service was ok, not the best, but also not the worst.  It's spacious inside, but if you are looking for that intimate, quiet setting, you will not find it here.  What really turned me off was the fact that when my 3 yr old daughter was acting up, my husband decided to walk with her so I could enjoy my Mother's Day brunch.  They passed the buffet and he asked either the manager or a server if he could take a piece of banana bread to settle her.   At the end when we got our bill, they had charged us $2 or close to that (I do not remember the exact amt.) for the banana bread we took from the buffet.  How cheesey and for Mother's Day too....turned me off of the place."}
{"text":"The salad buffet is the best and only reason we keep coming back.  The food is average, so we usually order something simple and stuff ourselves at the buffet."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a get together. Cozy and warm place as soon as you entered the restaurant...I think it is the yellow stucco decor that gives you a fuzzy warm  feeling.  The salad bar is awesome, so many selections and very fresh.  Never a disappointment when I come here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for food. We took advantage of the fact that it was the weekend and we slept in until noon. In spite of the time we woke up, both of us were jonesing breakfast type food.   I have been going to Bayview Village for years ... even back in the day when there was a K-Mart in this chic shopping mecca.Today was the day that I was going to finally enter this establishment found in the parking lot of Bayview Village.  The clientele consisted of elderly couples, elderly groups of friends, and families. There are both booths and tables that you can sit at. Parking is a plenty and it's free.  I ordered the Western Omelette, which is a generous portion that comes with mini hash browns, a piece of orange, and a bagel. For an additional $4.99, you can full access to the salad bar. This salad bar included: fruits, bread, dips, pastries, and obvi salads. I had to go for this option.  Weekends are busy, but in spite of that, service was awesome."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Their salad bar buffet is super good, healthy and filling! They have 2-3 different soups, lots of salads (not just the lettuce variety, but pasta salads, grains etc), veggies, bread, flatbreads and some desserty items.  You can get a meal and add the salad bar buffet for a small fee, or you can get the salad bar as a full meal.    I think this is the only place I've seen in the GTA region, with a salad bar buffet.  It's a great idea. This place is fairly large and busy. It's outside of Bayview Village. They also have a regular menu, standard American cafe type of food. Pretty ritzy area, great quality at a fair price!"}
{"text":"I ate here on the day of the \"big\" earthquake, and I was more interested in that than the food at Sierra Grill.   I opted for the salad bar, go me. With that being said, I wasn't too impressed with the salad bar, but then again for $11 (approx.) I guess you can't really go wrong. I guess it wouldn't be so bad if you're really into that kind of thing, but to me it tasted like an assortment of bean dishes I could have made myself.  Oh and the restaurant felt like it was 100 degrees, which made it difficult to enjoy the food anyways. While we were waiting for a table I asked the hostess if it was always that hot in there and she replied with a snide remark along the lines of \"well I'VE been here ALL day, so I'm already use to it.\" Cool.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"A good all around vegetable and salad bar. It is varied, relatively inexpensive, and has some tasty salads. Their menu items are varied, and generally pleasing. A good place for a quick dinner, especially if you like salads and seasoned veggies. They also feature 2 kinds of soup."}
{"text":"A group of six of us came here for breakfast/brunch on a Saturday and ordered off the menu.   The coffee was somewhat weak, and the Mediterranean omelette I ordered was decent but otherwise very ho-hum.   The service, however, was very good. When the waitress put down the Madeleine benny in front of me, I looked at it puzzled, and she picked up on it right away. I would probably not have sent it back as a wrong order, but she insisted the order be corrected. She also took it off the cheque. Our water glasses and coffee mugs were also refilled frequently so the service was very attentive.  We ended up staying for 3 hours chatting. The company, enhanced by good service and a comfortable environment helped us to enjoy a pleasant and relaxed break with our friends."}
{"text":"When I was younger (read: middle school) I thought Sierra was pretty cool.  All you can eat SALAD BAR (which I had never heard of before) which you got for free when you order an entree. An expanse of cold pastas (penne, macaroni, etc) mixed with sundried tomato, pesto, etc. Soup (as if anyone ever ate it. seriously. I have never seen the soup pots less than 90% full). Raw veggies, coleslaws, breads. fruits. ALL FOR FREE! My frugal asian mind couldn't stand it. It was beyond amazing.  Now when I go back I see what I failed to see before (wow. lyrics to a country song anyone?) which is that Sierra really isn't that great. The salad bar contains mostly starchy stuff like cold pastas or raw unflavoured veggies that have been sitting outside under their lights all day. the meals are mediocre (the meat is always wayyy too chewy. too hard to chew or swallow. you know when steak is like that? yeah.) and not anything special.  I DO recommend their brunch (ends at 2:30) because I like waffles and I like ice cream. so maybe I'm still a little kid. don't hate. and I guess they can get some bonus points for bringing me happiness when I was smaller.  But all in all...meh."}
{"text":"I really like this place for brunch. I don't know how excited I would get for a salad bar at dinner, but for a Sunday brunch it is perfect. Everything is really fresh and the serving area is kept very clean - it isn't your typical buffet. There are all kinds of salads, fruits and vegetables. I like the addition of soup, because its nice to have something warm.   There is a patio here that is small, but nice. The staff are very quick to clean up your plates and bring your drinks. There is a full menu here as well, I get tempted to order off of it, but the whole reason I go to this place is for the salad bar. It is about $11 or $12 and trust me, you can easily get full on what they offer."}
{"text":"This is a proven option for group or family brunches and dinners because there are so many choices and the pricing is reasonable. The salad bar is the best I've seen in the city; you get a lot of fresh, appealing options and the value is excellent if you're exclusively ordering the salad bar for your meal. There are always a variety of freshly made bread and soups, but I'm most impressed by the quality and quantity of salads. These don't look like your typical petrified buffet mystery coleslaw or sloppy ceasar; instead, plenty of colour and variety to satisfy!  I've ordered items off the menu and the food is good, albeit somewhat standard (you've probably seen a version of many of the choices in 10 other places). This is not the place to try something wildly exotic, but that's what makes it accessible to so many people!  Overall service and cleanliness is EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"I loved the day I was introduced to Sierra Grill.  It's an upper class restaurant that offers a large amount of food in their salad bar (Fantastic!). I've never had anything off the menu but I plan to one day. The wait staff is amazing and I've never left there with a negative vibe in my body.  Check it out. Its more on the pricey end but well worth it."}
{"text":"I always have a dilemma when ordering at Sierra Grill. I could get the all you can eat salad bar for $13.99.  Or I COULD order an entrée for $5 more which comes with a free salad bar. (Note: The salad bar is an extra dollar Friday through Sunday. REALLY. Are there actually more expensive items those days?)  My husband always argues that I should get the entrée because it's the better value, but he's wrong. For one, the entrees are only okay. Granted, I've only had one - the Orange Cranberry Chicken ($18.99), but I much preferred the salad bar and only ate my chicken because I felt like I should. Also, the salad bar is PLENTY of food.  So, yeah it's some salad bar. I think it's a little pricey for what you get, since there aren't a lot of expensive ingredients used, like say, meat. The spread is pretty impressive though. There are a couple soups, salad ingredients to make your own salad, fresh fruit, and a BIG selection of pre-made salads from Caesar to lentil to 3 bean to pesto pasta. There is also a bread cutting station with yummy cinnamon raisin bread. And last but not least, dessert. I think last time I was there it was bread pudding, which is my weakness.  This place always works great when my husband's extended family gets together because they can accommodate our large group and there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Sierra Grill is closed after 33 years in business.   I guess Sierra Grill doesn't really fit the vibe of the New Bayview Village!  http://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Eat/November-2011/Sierra-Grill/"}
