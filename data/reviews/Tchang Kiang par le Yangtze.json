{"text":"I have just found the very best egg rolls in Montreal.  I am usually not a fan of egg rolls but Yangtze's were so delicious I had to force myself to stop at 4.  They are tradtionnal cabbage and meat egg rolls which are 25-30% bigger than the usual size. Yangtze's rolls are bursting with filling and the meat content is very high compared to any other egg rolls I have eaten. The cabbage still retains a bit of crunchiness which I like very much. The dough is the perfect thickness and very crispy.   The kicker here is their plum sauce. It actually tastes like plum. It is closer in taste to Polish paszkis filling than the usual Chinese plum sauce.   All in all, these egg rolls are not to be missed.  Also tried the won ton soup and general tao chicken that were mediocre."}
{"text":"I see that one of their categories is Kitchen and Bath...makes sense I guess cause you might be spending a bit of time in the bathroom afterwards. Ha ha. I ordered this for delivery a couple months ago - I had the one of the generic combos and was really jonesing for some plain old beef and broccoli, so I ordered some of that too. After waiting for an hour, I called them back to make sure they hadn't forgotten about me. They hadn't, but it was another 20 minutes before my food showed up. Cold, I might add. Nothing was remarkable about the combo except the amount of grease and msg. However, there was something really remarkable about the beef and broccoli. There was no damn beef in it. I counted 6 thin slivers of beef in the entire order which was...wait for it...$14.50 without tax. The saving grace to this whole experience was that I opted not to go for their insanely overpriced battered prawns."}
{"text":"I almost passed this place by due to the one solitary review of 1 star...Not only is this place open but the staff is friendly and the food is fresh , tasty, and delicious. I always use my standard selections to gauge how good the food is...in this case I got the standard won ton soup an eggroll and the general tao plate.  The WonTon broth was made just right and petfectly balanced. The Egg rolls made fresh were much better than expected...and the General Tao was exceptional with a surprising amount of meat with just the right amount of batter....please discover for yourself...this place is worth your time."}

{"text":"I have not been to a good chinese restaurant in a long time.  This was extremely delicious.  We had the best peanut butter dumplings, but the salt and pepper squid was fantastic.  The staff was very pleasant.  Kenneth was nice and efficient.  We are definitely going back for more."}

{"text":"Ordered take-out at 5:45. Was told to collect the food in 15 minutes - arrived at restaurant and had to wait another 20 minutes. Checking the invoice, i was charged for Chow mein which I did not order nor was it included in the take-out. oops. Refunded me the $10.00 The dumplings were all dough and the beef in black bean sauce had no beans in it. Just bland brown sauce. Spare ribs were delicious and chicken with spinach was very tasty. Eggs rolls were crispy.  Disappointing meal which cost more than $80."}
{"text":"Holy crap.....these are by far the best eggrolls in the city- they're HUGE and full of Chinese yummyness (whatever that means). The peanut butter dumplings are fantastic and the won ton soup is excellent as well. I'm a big fan of General Tao chicken and normally judge a Chinese restaurant based on that one dish. Theirs is not the best but it's adequate so when you add in all the other great dishes I'd still highly recommend this restaurant. It's a bit pricey but worth the money. They also deliver for those days when you're just too damn lazy to go out.....or all of December-February in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. I highly recommend the salt and pepper tofu and the honey garlic spareribs. The service was also great! The servers were so pleasant and helpful, the food came out quickly and hot. My water glass was refilled constantly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yeah, okay. So, we've lived in NDG for over a year now, and we've been wanting to get Chinese from somewhere for a while. This seemed like the best spot. I stopped in once before to get a menu, and tonight, we ordered.  We got the dinner pack #1. 3 spring/egg rolls each. 1 chow mein. 1 sweet/sour ribs. 1 vegetable fried rice. 1 hot and sour soup. (Small adjustments are possible). Total was $33 with tip, which was really amazing we thought. But we figured out why eventually.  Spirng/egg rolls were amazing, never had bad ones before to tbh. Chow mein was meh, just bland flavored noodles. As was the vegetable fried rice, just very nothing flavored and soggy. Even adding salt didn't help.  But the ribs were actually revolting. Bits and pieces of pork bone chips covered in flour and water and fried. Little balls, not even shaped like ribs. You bite into a dough balls to find little shards of bone in your mouth. So disgusting. But covered in this mega tasty red syrup. I threw out the last 50% :( Also, the soup was pretty bad, no flavor at all. Like floating mushrooms and sprouts in red colored water.  This is not good at all. I'd never order again or go back. I still feel a bit gross thinking about the texture and shards of bone and uncared for flavors.  Such a shame. We were kinda excited that this would be good."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service. People rave about the egg-rolls... we found them very boring, bland. The filling is just cabbage. They were crispy and not greasy. WonTon soup was just like everybody else's. Shrimp in lobster sauce and beef in black bean sauce were just ok.... very bland and dull."}
