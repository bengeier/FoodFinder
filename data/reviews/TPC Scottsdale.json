{"text":"Course was in great shape and is reasonably priced for a TPC course. This is a fun course to play but is very tight! Great location right at the Marriott in Scottsdale and is convenient to get to from most places.  The people were friendly except for one guy in the pro shop. Interestingly the 18th hole is the only one where there were some quality issues as the fairway and green were not in as good of shape as the rest of the course.  All in all though, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed golfing here and I'll tell you why first off the course is amazing it fits the benefits of every golfer out there. Now onto the clubhouse, the clubhouse is well maintained it has your standard golf locker room with shower equipped and the food is really good I'd say one of the best golf course food I've had but the negatives are that the snack cart dosent come around as often as other golf courses do. But in general if your looking to golf for a good price and looking for fun I highly recommend going here"}
{"text":"Played Champions again and must say it's heading in a better direction.  Maybe they read my review?  Greens were headed in the right direction.  Still too many ball marks, but they were rolling much, much better (10 on stimp).  Still can't get over how many un-filled divots there are in the fairways.  I understand they get a lot of play but don't you have a maintenance crew?  The course marshals were a joke (Richard) and could barely be bothered to say hello.  We thought it would be a great idea to require that the course marshals be given a giant bucket of sand and rather than sit under a tree doing nothing, fill some divots in-between groups.  They've got to solve the divot issue or this place will always be a $49 muni-style.     Will be playing Stadium this weekend so will send an update."}
{"text":"We just played the champions course on saturday and all I can say is that the entire maintenance crew has been at the Stadium course for a very long time and have not paid attention to the champions course. There are a lot more choices throughout the greater Scottsdale area that you can play at that are far better maintained than TPC."}
{"text":"Highly overrated, arrogant course for way too much money. Was excited to play a course where the pga plays but it's obvious they know people will do this and over charge and rush you. And they don't even have GPS in the carts for the amount you pay! So many other cheaper, friendlier, just as challenging courses in Arizona to go to.  Go there!"}
{"text":"First and last time at the tpc stadium course. Course was in poor condition. Greens were beat to heck. They still had the big cups and flags on the greens. The starter was a no show at the first tee but then caught up to me on 1 green and asked me why I wasn't with the group in front of me as I was a single. I just told him that there was no one on the tee and the starter was no where to be found, so what else was I suppose to do. Joined up with the threesome in front of me and enjoyed the company. That was until 18 when we were heckled by a bunch of drunk douche bags on the patio bar at the clubhouse. They began to throw golf balls out on the green while we were still putting out.  Mentioned the incident to a club employee and he just said sorry.    There are so many other places to play in Scottsdale so make sure this one doesn't make your list. My local public course in Houston is much better than this goat track."}
{"text":"I was only able to play the front 9; my wrist was hurting too much to finish, which is a big deal because I live in IL, and was returning from LA and stopped here specifically to play the TPC. Oh well.  I was a single, and got paired with another. The course was pretty open, but we took our time and enjoyed the round. The front nine, although rarely shown on TV, is quite nice. Definitely challenging enough, and I didn't even play the back tees.  It was fairly easy to get on, the bar had pretty good food for a clubhouse, and the staff were very helpful. Definitely recommend the TPC."}
{"text":"To be honest I was disappointed with TPC the course was not in great shape and the layout was ok I might might have set my sights a little high before I got there. If you want to play here because you want to say you played the TPC then fine but there are other courses around that are better and for much better deal. I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great course. Wellmaintained. Saw my first desert snake. Help! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Two great courses and of course the annual Waste Management Open. Probably the single rowdiest event on the PGA."}
{"text":"It was fun to play a TPC course. Great scenery and landscaping. Wide fairways and big greens. However the price was high and the greens were full of divots."}
{"text":"The service in this place sucks!  Who rushes a foursome when they put a twosome right behind us?  We ended up finishing our round in 4.5 hours!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Yes the greens are being worked on, but in a month they'll be great!! Tee boxes & fairways are in perfect shape! You can find errant shots on other fairways (saving strokes baby) and the staff is very friendly. Recommend to anyone in playing in Scottsdale. We played as a 4-some in just under 4 hours - great pace of play!"}
{"text":"Snobby golf course. Overpriced. Lots of golf courses in the valley that are much nicer and less expensive. No GPS, the course is not well maintained. The ranger has a power trip. This course is a novelty and that's about it."}
{"text":"Stunning scenery and exceptionally maintained course."}
{"text":"Played 11/23/17 Stadium Course   The only reason why this course is receiving two stars is because of staff members Taylor and Corby.   Taylor agreed to move our tee time up so that we would be able to finish before dark; at the range Corby pointed out the new tee time required a fore caddie, which we did not want or need.  Taylor came down and it was agreed we would go out ten minutes later...a one hour open block of time with no other golfers booked.  Sweet!  Keep this in mind - all groups ahead of us had a fore caddie for every two players.   And then it started going downhill.  The pace of play management was absolutely horrible!   By the time we made the turn, there were three - yes, three! - groups waiting on the box.  Being ever the optimist, we patiently (or not so much) wait.  At this point the entire rhythm of the game is shot to smitherenes and we sat for so long between shots that we were frustrated. As we finished 13, there were now four groups waiting on 14.  Oh, heck no!  We are done with this BS and head back to the clubhouse.   As we pass the groups we notice that while the lead group on 14 is just approaching the green, the group on 15 is also approaching and the group on 16 is replacing the pin.  How in the world does this happen - ESPECIALLY when there are fore caddies?!  For a world renown TPC course, this is absolutely unacceptable.  For a round of golf that can go for more than $200, it is insulting.    When I voiced my complaint to the manager in the pro shop, his repeated parroted response was, \"I'm sorry you did not have an enjoyable experience.\"  Don't spend money here just because it is a designated TPC or because No. 16 gets you all misty eyed when watching a tournament on television.  Those are the only two things this highly overrated course has to offer."}
{"text":"What a disappointment today. For $225 per round after tax I expected a whole lot more. Summer time weather conditions with it being nearly 100Â° yet still charged full spring rates? As a whole, the course is in horrible shape. No notification or condition warnings about seasonal work bring done. Mowers and weedeaters on virtually every hole all day long. Fairways were in ok shape but the rough is all yellowed out. Greens were obviously just aerated and sanded...it was like putting on concrete and not a single shot would hold the green. I know there's a giant tournament held here every February, but you think they could throw some sod down on the plots where there were grandstand posts on 16, 17 or 18? I mean....it has been 3 months. When booking this round it was advertised with a \"Four-Caddie\" to be included. On the 1st tee, we were told the 4 caddies stopped last week...what the heck did we pay extra for? And at that price, nothing else complimentary included? When I played here a few years ago, we got a couple complimentary water bottles, a sleeve of ProV1's, a bag tag, and a couple granola bars. Today, we got fresh ice in the ice chest and a bag tag. That's it.... AND we were advised no outside refreshments at check in so what's the point of fresh ice? Gps golf carts slow to an embarrassing crawl if your tee shot strays and you drive outside the fairway to find a ball. Not everyone is a scratch golfer who hits EVERY fairway ya know, not even the PROS. So yeah, a very dissatisfied customer today. It will be along time before I play TPC Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"The course was in very good shape, but the round took 5.25 hours.  The booking agents seemed to be put off by the business, and when we finished our round, we were told that the Grill was closed for drinks, but we could go inside to shop for apparel.  For the price, this was the worst golf experience of my life."}
{"text":"Played there this week.  This course was in such bad shape that the tee boxes looked to be random in the middle of a field with weeds all over.  Most fairways had large spots of patch worked in grass that was dead.  It was only $39 to play but I would have thought it would be a nice course since it's a TPC course and part of the waste management tournament."}
{"text":"What a thrill it is to play such a great course that you've been attending the Phoenix open at! The course was in immaculate shape for being the end of the summer. Locker & practice facilities were great. The restaurant \"Toro\" was delicious but pretty pricey for lunch after golf."}
{"text":"Great day. Great golf... Good greens and nice staff"}
{"text":"Played during our stay in October.  Just reopened after re seeding,  but was in pretty good shape.  The staff was great from the starter to the guys who checked us in. Max helped us out and was a great representative for the course."}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting.   Rooms were kept very well.  Alisha at the front desk easy very helpful and accommodating.   We are looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Great course and people.     Staff is very nice and professional.   Course is always in great shape and play is pretty fast all the time"}
{"text":"Played the Stadium course the following weekend after the Waste Management tournament.  The course was in excellent shape (obviously) and the stands were still up.  The sand was immaculate and very fluffy.  I am a 15 handicapper and shot 83 here - with 10 pars and a disastrous hole with 5 putts that got me a 7 there.  The greens were very well manicured from the PGA tournament previous weekend.  Caddie was good and very knowledgeable that probably had a big impact on my score that day.  It also had the Championship course with a separate clubhouse and location. For the budget minded that is a better choice but the course condition defers.  They are all good courses.   Stadium course seemed a bit ordinary in level of difficulty of play but then I was on a roll that day and a 8 handicap in my group shot 90+.  Overall between the score I had and the condition of the course, it was a memorable event for me. Go play there !!!"}
{"text":"I played there last Saturday it was one of the best rounds of my life I believe the championship course is great for anyone at any skill level. The pro shop staff is amazing, the course is in amazing shape! I'm 16 and a 12 handicap the junior rate was beyond reasonable with a cart is was 93 dollars which was a bargain. The food prices were very reasonable I got a bottle soda a hotdog and chips for 9 bucks I think. The staff is the most friendly including marshals and starter LEN was amazing he gave the best info of any starter ever! They really treat you like your a tour pro there."}
{"text":"Home of the annual Waste Management Phoenix Open (WMPO).  Great golf course, sitting in the heart of North Scottsdale near Loop-101.  Easy access to anywhere and everywhere."}
{"text":"Besides the Waste Management, this course is super overrated!  The green fee was astronomical even the time of year and cart path only! Even the beer girl was pushy about her sales and push for gratuity by telling me a sob story, pathetic! The grass and view was awesome, plus the 16th hole didn't disappoint. I wouldn't play here again and would rather watch the from the tv instead."}
{"text":"Updated review as I played the Stadium course this time.  Much better experience - nicer layout, better conditions, more professional staff and service. Nice practice facility.  Played in the summer when rates are way down.  Nice course but don't know that it is worth the rates charged in peak season.  Stadium is much better experience than Champions course."}
{"text":"Played here on 3/12/13. I was very disappointed in the condition of the course as well as the noise as they were still taking down the stands from the tourney.  1st off, we started on the back nine.  The greens were scruffy and even the forecaddie, which they force on you, couldn't figure them out.  Then we went to the front and they had just punched the greens in the last two weeks.  Holes were sizes of pin holes, but very noticeable and they were lightning fast.  You play a course like this and you would actually like to finish your round like it was meant to be played, but they switch it up and don't tell you until after you paid your $300 to play.  I would not play this course again, and I wouldn't recommend it and I've been a golfer for over 40 years!  There are PLENTY of other courses in town."}
{"text":"The course just reopened after a grand redesign. It was in perfect shape as it is high season in Arizona for the snowbirds. The entire round was an experience. I admit I was pampered. After checking in I met my forecaddy for the group.  Beiderwolf. I decided wolf would do. German from Wisconsin. Normally I play terrible with a caddy. Find myself playing for them psychologically.  And it takes time for them to learn your game.  Luckily wolf had some great reads on the greens and was clubbing me correctly. Having a forecaddy also improved our pace of play. He had yardages when we arrived at our balls and kept us playing while he took care of the details. We finished in 4 hours.  And that is the whole point: play golf fast, an oxymoron IF there ever was one!  The course is well thought out. The redesign made it longer and more challenging. Playing the blues from 6600 yards played closer to 7000 as there was no roll out. The fairways and greens we're emaculate.  The greens were stimping around 11 and rolling true.  The signature holes at 15, 16, 17, 18 are a great finish and I parred the last 5 holes. 14 is the most drastic redesign with an elevated green, the only such green on the course making it feel out of place.  The first hole is the easiest at 360 yards and follows the philosophy of starting your round with an easy hole. The fourth is a par three to a new green that overlooks the Fairmont princess hotel.  The entire course as with all tpc courses is designed for spectators with large rolling hills and seating areas throughout. The stands on 16 were going up and it was as big as a football stadium. Great fun during the tournament. I'd recommend it as the experience was a truly memorable and positive one. It sucks when the round ends and you want to keep playing."}
{"text":"Good facilities and fun. I would say the redesign of the champions course has been a great thing and the stadium course speaks for itself. My only compaint is the greens are always kind of slow but everything is quality.  Lots of good choices in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great great time! We had club house tickets for the whole weekend so the experience was that much more enjoyable. It was my first time attending Phoenix Open so I didn't really know what to expect. The weather was a bit too warm and the over 200 K people there (each day) made it hard to see everything but fortunately we had access to special seating with and without air conditioning, depending on choice, unlimited food and drinks and valet parking. The people watching alone was so entertaining. Hehe!  Given the size and popularity of this event, I found everything very organized, clean and enjoyable. If you love sports and Phoenix Open Golf Tournament is something you want to try, I would definitely recommend getting good tix."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my trip to the Champions course.  From beginning to end it was a huge letdown. I'd read several reviews stating that for the money the Champions course was better than the stadium course. The turf on the driving range was loose and sandy. It almost felt like I was trying to hit bunker shots. We were paired with two other guys that were great people to play with. The first five holes the marshall followed us. He moved to a new position after every shot the group hit. He went from in front of our group to behind the group and back.  He finally said that we were out of position. Understandable. I let him know that we wouldn't be out of position if he wasn't moving between each shot causing us to wait. He finally left us alone and we caught the group in front of us and waited on them for every shot after for he rest of the day.  The next issue was the beverage cart lady. If someone wants to buy something then you probably shouldn't get upset that he wants to pay with a card and you have to write the information down. Her response was \" Ugh. A card? What is it with you guys?\" She came around a few more times stating \"well I can't go anywhere until your carts move due to the erosion.\"   The final issue has to do with the course condition itself. I wasn't sure what to expect with the lower rate compared to the Stadium course and the Grayhawk course we played yesterday.  I know for sure that the condition the Champions course is in right now is not up to par for even the lower rate. The greens were great, I will give them that. The fairways were burnt up on 50% of them. I had multiple hard pan shots after hitting the middle of the fairway. There were spots in the fairway that I needed to take relief from standing water.  We decided against driving across the road to play the Stadium due to this experience. I wish I had paid the extra up front and likely had a better experience with the Stadium. Oh well, on to better Scottsdale golf courses the rest of the trip!"}
{"text":"I played TPC Stadium this morning for the first time, just a few days after the Phoenix Open was held there. It was pouring down rain, which sucked because I came to AZ to enjoy some sunshine. But it also thinned out the crowd and it allowed me to play as a single and finish my round in less than three hours.  Another cool feature was that the bleachers were still erected - making it the closest that I will ever get to feeling like a pro.  I sucked ass on the front nine, partially because of the rain, partially because of this new duck hook that I've got on my tee shot. I seemed to be in trouble every time I prepared for my second shot. Thankfully the rain turned to a light sprinkle and my game stepped it up a notch. I played pretty good on the back and finished the round with a 92.  Only slight disappointments were that the course was a little more flat that I imagined, and the Pro Shop didn't have that many cool things.    5 stars - but I've had better..."}
{"text":"This is a review of the Champions course at TPC.  Overall, this course is a big disappointment.  The conditions were poor with the greens bombarded with ball marks, tee boxes filled with divots.  The course looks like a run down, old course.  Maintenance must be on vacation here...How dare the PGA put their name on this course with such bad conditions.   The layout feels like a muni someplace in Texas.  The holes, most especially the par 3s, are plain vanilla.  Finally, if you come to Scottsdale thinking this is a desert course you will be disappointed.  There isn't a cactus to be found here, and the desert is hard pan waste areas.  No desert.  The cart girl disappeared for 2 hours in the heat of the day.  When we asked where she went the reply was \"I went to lunch\".  Hun, have lunch on the damn cart! There are many many better choices for golf nearby.  I would not return here again."}
{"text":"Had a fun day on the course. It was in great condition and the people working at the course couldn't be nicer. Forecaddies were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Couldn't have recorded the relatively low score without them. We only had to wait for other foursome playing in front us. One of the guys is kind of a prick, so no surprise there. Otherwise we moved pretty well.  Having played at the Ocean Course, Pebble Beach, and Sawgrass, I can't quite put this course in the same 5 star echelon, but close. Then again, it doesn't cost as much to play as these courses, so maybe some value there."}
{"text":"golfed the stadium coarse with my wife, just wasn't impressed, some of the public courses in scottsdale area are better and more challenging, also don't rent clubs from them , 2 sets $181, really !!  that was more then my car rental for 3 days."}
{"text":"Horrible does not adequately describe this course, the caddies, or management.  If you want to play an expensive five-hour round of golf play TPC Scottsdale.  4 groups on the 14th!  What is appealing is that there foursomes actually had two caddies each!  24 people on one hole!  No response from the pro shop!  Too many other nice courses that are better managed.  Compare the boulders south course."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of playing at this famed course recently and the golf itself was a very nice experience, especially with the ability to say you've played a course that's been featured on the pro tour.  The greens were well kept and with it still being in the late part of the summer for the region, the fairways and roughs were dry and some places quite brown but it's nothing unexpected.  When we first arrived, the bag drop attendees were very helpful and got us all set up.  Even the check-in process was good.  Because it was the first time for many of us here, we decided to tour the clubhouse and ran into Gary Johnson.  Gary was nice enough to take us on an impromptu tour and even allowed us access to the members' locker room where a lot of the pros had their names.  The tour and the education from Gary was a great start to the day and I had high hopes/expectations.  As I stated before, the golf was fine and the front-9 went off without an issue.  However, the back-9 is where the issue came up and were it not for the seriousness of the issue and the manage in which the staff addressed it (or rather, didn't address it), I would have still given this establishment a good review.  Being a late summer day, the temperature still got into the high 90's, almost 100 degrees.  I had 3 full bottles of water in my cooler at the start of the back-9 and after seeing the refreshment cart a number of times as well as a number of water coolers, I didn't think keeping myself hydrated would be an issue.  However, by the 12th hole, I had gone through 2 bottles of water and was expecting to be able to fill them up with water soon.  The following 2 water coolers were empty and by the start of the 14th hole, having gone through my last bottle of water, I was in desperate need of water.  Upon coming up to the tee box of the 15th, I finally saw the refreshment cart and bought 2 bottles of water, downing one right away.  I then called up to the clubhouse informing them the coolers were empty and they needed to be filled right away.  I also saw a grounds maintenance personnel and informed them of the same and they assured me they would be filled immediately.  However, there were no more coolers left after that on the course so I have no way of knowing if they were filled.  My next disappointment came when we finished the round and came back into the clubhouse.  The attendees asked how our round when and I told them the golf was fine but I informed them of the water issue.  They offered some apologies but that was it so I decided to bring the matter to the clubhouse's attention.  When I came into the clubhouse, I again informed them of the situation and in addition to some less than enthusiastic apologies, I was given a half dozen pointless excuses.  This is THE TPC for crying out loud... your whole brand is giving golfers the ultimate golf experience and this is the experience you're putting out there as well as risking the safety of golfers on a hot day on your world famous course?!?!  I expected better from you.  The coolers shouldn't even have ran dry before I had to inform you and for 1 cooler to be empty, sure, maybe the group ahead of us just emptied it but for 2 coolers back to back to be empty?!?!  Totally unacceptable and again, dangerous to the well being of your guests.  And knowing the situation, you should have ran water our to each of the groups on the course!!!!  Again, the latter part of the day was totally unacceptable and because of that, I will be telling all of my golfing friends that TPC Scottsdale is NOT worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good course at an affordable price. The staff is really friendly. Challenging but not overly difficult. Tight fairways, loved it when I had to hit from the rough."}
{"text":"Played the championship course - I got to tell you there are nicer courses in AZ especially in the Scottsdale area, the course is under the 21 approach into Scottsdale airport so you get jets ripping by every 10 mins, not my idea of relaxing (unless I was on the jet) - Kierland, Rancho Manana, even Silverado are better than this - TPC - come on it is just a name.  (the toury course may be better)  -"}
{"text":"Playing championship course tees off at 218 pm.  The group in front of us are thinking they are tiger... no Marshall!!!!  We will not finish.., save your money... better courses around here to play."}
{"text":"4 stars for the champions course...good condition, fun course- negatives are the cost, the lack of gps in carts.  2 stars for the restaurant Toro....very small portions of their signature dishes and the service was quite slow"}
{"text":"Well it would be tough to come out of here feeling like you got a good \"value\" out of your round at $300 a pop during high season.  Nevertheless, they really make the effort to make every facet of your round the best it can possibly be at the Stadium Course, and it comes through.  First: the forecaddie.  Every foursome gets one, and I cannot imagine navigating this challenging course without the guidance of our forecaddie, Wally.  Wally knew every inch of the course, and gave us the requisite hole previews, sprinted out into the fairways to find our tee shots, saved us from hazardous cacti in the desert, gave us detailed yardage measurements, and read greens when necessary.  Every read was spot on; he must've saved me at least 5 putts over the course of the round.  The course itself is exquisitely manicured, even just a couple weeks after the WM Open.  The greens are gorgeous, and quite fast but not incomprehensibly so.  Every cut of fairway and rough is pristine, but the coolest part is definitely the desert patches all around (and sometimes within!) the fairways.  The desert contains all manner of exotic cactus and is a veritable nature reserve of itself.  There are also a ton of jackrabbits, chipmunks and birds who are all astonishingly friendly and unafraid (but also unthreatening).  Obviously the final four holes here are the golfing highlight, and they didn't disappoint (despite causing me to make an \"other\" on the par five 15th).  This is one of the most gorgeous four-hole stretches I've ever played, and I would love to have the opportunity to play it again some day.  But for the moment I'll have to settle for watching them on TV next January."}
{"text":"I have volunteered for 2 years at the WM Phoenix Open that is held at the TPC Scottsdale every January-February.  This is a beautiful golf course.  The grandstand at the 16th hole is a site to see.  The Open is a well run, fun event that I would recommend to anyone.  All lot of the volunteers at the concession stands are supporting charitable causes which the Thunderbirds support."}
{"text":"The current condition of the Stadium course is very poor, apparently from a very cold winter.  The course was closed in July and August 2011, in an effort to nurse it back to health.  Even putting the condition aside, the course layout was good, the greens were slow, but overall not a very challenging course.  With the stadium setup, there was tons of room on several holes to spray drives everywhere and still have them in play.  The best part will be watching it on TV this winter and knowing I played the course.  I would bet there are many other courses in the Scottsdale area that would rank as a better course over TPC.  The customer service was excellent and very friendly.  My playing partner rented clubs and it was a very nice set of Calloways.  The practice area and range were very good."}
{"text":"My friends and I have played at this course for two straight years during our annual labor day golf trip. I love way the course uses the natural dessert. There is fine wildlife that may walk through the course. My friends and I saw a fox in the front 9. Im also a fan of the flavored towels they have. They definitely make those hot days bearable."}
{"text":"Phx Open on the 16th hole is always a good time"}
{"text":"loved every min of this. Great course. easy to walk and lots of fun. the 16th hole is a must. More fun than any hole in golf"}
{"text":"Both courses are really nice.  It's particularly fun to play the Stadium course if you've ever watched the pro tournament played here."}
{"text":"Always great to play a course that's on the tour.  Are there nicer courses, absolutely, but this one is a must play.  Staff was great from start to finish.  I really liked the course layout and it played fairly short from the blues.  The par 5s are reachable in 2 if you have any distance, but you can get in trouble fast here.  Greens and fairways were excellent condition and some of the scenery on the back was great."}
{"text":"Great layout. I've only been for the waste management tournament, but it's gotta be great to be able to accommodate this large of an event."}
{"text":"What a BEAUTIFUL course. I was blown away. And I've lived by the Olympic Club in San Francisco for most of my life. TPC Scottsdale is like an Oasis in the desert. It accents the beauty of the desert perfectly.   I was here for the Waste Management Phoenix Open. What a great time. I still can't believe how loud and drunk the crowd was- no wonder the pros hate coming for it. There wasn't anywhere within 20 ft of me that I couldn't buy a beer or two. There were 201,000 people on the Saturday I went... breaking the all-time attendance record for a golf tournament!  Overall it was a great experience. The staff was really enthusiastic, friendly, and helpful. Hopefully one day I'll be able to play a round of golf myself on this course."}
{"text":"We watch the Waste Management PGA Open so since we were heading to Scottsdale, it was a no brainer that we had to play this course.  Sure, we booked a late tee time since it was much cheaper that way... why wouldn't you!  The course itself was not as nice as I thought it would be, but maybe because it was summer?  And having said that, since it was summer, you would think, they would do a better job of ensuring that the water and ice machines throughout the course would be replenished.  They were all empty.  The lady in the cart came around here and there though so that helped.  And she was really nice.  The cart guys at the beginning of the course were really nice.  But when we first got out to Hole #1, the ranger wasn't even there so we were waiting for a bit.  He finally came out eventually and when he did, he was nice as well.  But, I kind of really expected a lot more at this course.  And, so back to my tee time.  We booked a late tee time, around 3:30pm.  We arrived early and wanted to push it up about an hour.  I guess every hour you push it up, they charge you more.  But seriously, why can't they just let you on an hour earlier?  I mean they charge $30 more PER PERSON just to play an hour earlier.  It's not like it was packed with people waiting or anything.  And for pete's sake it was 110 degrees.  That was kind of annoying...."}
{"text":"Save your money .... With all the golf courses in Scottsdale be sure to skip this one.   The staff is arrogant.  They acted like they were doing me a favor by letting me play there.  When you walk in the place smells like a locker room at the YMCA.  For the amount of money it takes to play there I wouldn't have expected to be followed around on the first 5 holes by an idiot driving a John Deere pulling a jet engine blower screaming at 150 decibels.  Watching him drive back and forth was almost comical.  That combined with back up beepers from all the heavy equipment tearing apart the stadiums from the PHX Open made it a terrible experience.  TPC should pull there name from this course.  I have played better municipal courses."}
{"text":"First time at TPC Scottsdale for waste management open, outstanding tournament. First off the parking and bus shuttle service is very useful, the staff at the course were very helpful. Beers & food was a reasonable price, can't wait till the next open."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to play this course in late December, just after the skyboxes and grandstands were setup in preparation for the Waste Management Phoenix Open.  It was an unbelievable experience playing on a course like this. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpc-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=b8S5ixALJ8fig3eDLQKt5Q#b8S5ixALJ8fig3eDLQKt5Q http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpc-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=ztolGdWKuqHmSFKIj6xPXA#ztolGdWKuqHmSFKIj6xPXA  The course was in perfect shape.  The rough will kill you though if you play anytime around the Open....that's because they get it in shape for the tour, so the level of difficulty is really high for us weekend hackers.  Our caddie was awesome.  He explained a few of the historical aspects of the course, like Tiger Woods Rock from 1999's Phoenix Open. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tpc-scottsdale-scottsdale?select=k6CKLiApSShNU0WirXVwxQ#k6CKLiApSShNU0WirXVwxQ  Overall, it's a pretty awesome golf experience.  A must do if you're a golfer visiting Scottsdale.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Great course-nice fairways and the greens rolled well too even though it's clear they get a lot of play.  I hope to come back now that I know the layout better.  Definitely worth playing once since the PGA tour has an event here."}
{"text":"Played this one a lot.  Great course and always solid.  You need to show up here when the weather is above par.  Have fun."}
{"text":"TPC Scottsdale is one of my favorite courses in the valley for a variety of reasons.  Both the Stadium and Champions courses are typically in great shape relative to other courses when taking into account the time of year.  In the vast majority of rounds pace of play has been exceptional.  Stadium course can get slow as some players are fixated on playing where the pros play and feel the need to make the most of their experience and take pictures and read every putt like their round was riding on it.  The marshals do keep on it as best they can.  Everyone I have encountered on both courses has been very friendly and helpful.  Also ,the TPC Pass is one of the best deals in town.  Being able to play either course for a cart fee after 2:30 is a steal, especially in the fall/winter months. The other perks of the pass make it hard to play anywhere else as reduced green fees make the value hard to beat.  I typically prefer to play Champions however after watching the open I am more inclined to play Stadium a few times before I get back over to Champions."}
{"text":"Got the opportunity to play both courses, especially the Stadium course on the last day before it was closed for final preps of the Waste Management tournament. The Stadium course was in great shape and the caddy we had was excellent. Playing No. 16 in the stadium was an experience I will never forget. Too bad the seats weren't filled with people watching, lol. Greens were lightning fast."}
{"text":"Not really a public course. They charge $80 just to practice. Couldn't hit the range or practice green without paying. Staff was arrogant. I should've stayed in Cali."}
{"text":"I played the Stadium Course on Saturday (June 9) for the first time. I was rather surprised at how bad the fairways were. I was driving the ball well and over half of my 2nd shots were being hit off of dirt.  I was pleased with the place of play as our round was done in 4 hours. I would consider playing here again, but only after calling to see what condition the course is in"}
{"text":"This is the fourth TPC course I've played(Vegas, Dallas and Scottsdale). TPC Scottsdale is similar to the other three, well maintained, greens roll nice even though they are a little slow, and good service with a  very good staff.  But, there is nothing really special about this course. No hole really stood out. Ok #16 only because its so well known, but on its own its just another par three.  I can see why the Pros shoot 15-20 under par on this course.  I do want to recognize our Fore Caddy, Trevor, he was great. He was very knowledgeable and was great to talk to during the round. I would highly recommend him. In the summer he caddies at the Straits in Wisconsin.   Overall, unless you just want to play where the pros play, I feel your money is better spent at other courses in the area"}
{"text":"TPC Scottsdale: Stadium Round played on 06/13/17, 06:30 tee time, $105 per person.   Home to Waste Management's infamous tournament; probably one of the most rowdy and college like golf event on the PGA tour. \"Stadium\" Hole #16 is the modern age, Roman coliseum like arena.  Let's be frank, we picked to play this course because of the hype. We were \"tourist\" golfers. This course was probably the one on our list that we looked forward to the most. TPC Scottsdale actually has two courses: Stadium and Championship. By simply talking to numerous locals and other golfers visiting Scottsdale strictly for golfing, everyone is just automatically drawn to Stadium because of its popularity.  The staff was professional, helpful, and courteous. We arrived early and dropped our bags off first. The guys prepped our cart for us. I immediately noticed that they had Titleist clubs to rent and the newest models available: 917 driver, AP2, AP1, etc. They had a few other brands available as well but it seemed like Titleist was the leading pack. After checking in, we headed over to their range to warm up. They will send over a guy to let you know when to head over to the 1st tee box.  If it is your time like it was ours, the first hole had its aura of \"Wow, I'm playing the course the pros play that I've seen on TV.\" However, after a few holes on the first nine, the hype will soon wear off. Nothing stood out as amazing. The greens weren't as fast as I thought they would be and the conditions were mediocre. They did ask us to try our best to apply the 90 degree cart rule and if we had to drive on the fairway to just stay off the rough as much as we could. Lots of holes were lined up against homes and/or condos. The starter gave us a helpful yardage book that I wished I used more of.  When you finally reach the back 9, things start to open up a little bit and you start to wonder about that hole #16, par 3. We saw less homes and just more open land. You can get better pictures on the back 9 because it's much more picturesque. Hole 16 without the grand stands is really just a short par 3. We did take a minute to stand around, trying to imagine it all, while snapping as many pictures as we could. They had like four maintenance guys around on this hole. I found the back 9 holes to be a little more target golf, with more hazards coming into play. I don't recall any water hazards on the front, but be ready for some on the back 9. Do look out for that nasty left side bunker after the water hazard on hole #18.  All in all, I would suggest to every golf enthusiast to come and try TPC Scottsdale: Stadium just to say you have played where the pros come through on tour. However, if and when I do come back to Scottsdale, I think I will skip Stadium and try the Championship Course. Many locals told us that it is quite underrated, in better shape, and has a lot less visitors since everyone is stacked on Stadium. If it wasn't for the Waste Management tournament that goes through Stadium course, then I would think of this course as any other course. I never even really felt like I was in a desert setting except for the heat that started to bare on us near the end of the round.  The club house seemed like a pretty cool spot to hang out after the round. The locker room had a country club like feel to it. Knock Stadium course off your to-do (play) list, snap some pictures for memory and proof, and move onto the many numerous courses in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"Course was great as always, however, we left our golf GPS in the cart.  We went the next day after calling and was told that the cart boys had not turned anything in. Hard to believe especially after we gave them $20 tip for cleaning the clubs after the round.  The young man at the counter in the pro shop did nothing to help us out other than just giving us a \"hey, sh%# happens\" look. Understand it is our fault for leaving it there, but we won't go back - hate to think if we had left something really valuable in the cart.  Pretty sad really."}
{"text":"We found the course to be nice. Greens and fairways were not as pristine as I had hoped. Played Champions Course 3/30/18.  All staff were very pleasant. Club house, food services, beverage cart, starter...everyone was very nice. Accessing the course was easy, and our round was pretty smooth at right around 4hrs 15 mins. Which is a good pace.   Greens played pretty fast, disappointed not a lot of golfers had the courtesy to tend to their divots and ball marks.   We had perfect weather, not too hot.   Only real thought is that the course conditions did not seem like a $120 per round course. Having played a few Trump courses, and Torrey, and some of the great tracks around SoCal, I thought it would be magnificent, and it was \"just ok.\""}
{"text":"We played on May 5th 8am tee time for the stadium course.  Signage could be better to the practice areas an although it was in good shape Quintero was in better shape.  The Marshal was harassing us to play faster with nobody behind us.  Not a good way to enjoy the round."}
{"text":"The TPC Scottsdale Stadium and Champions courses are way over rated! The Champions course is nothing more than a hacked up muni. In 2011 the greens have about 60% coverage of grass, the rest is dirt painted green! They roll at about a 7 on the stimp meter (very slow and rough). The Stadium course greens are much nicer.  One of my other chief complaints about these courses is that year around you will have balls plugging and balls with mud on them. They over water the courses to try and keep them green (still lots of dried out brown spots though). There is no sand base under the turf so you get lots of wet/muddy spots. They do dry out the Stadium course just before the PGA plays there, but the rest of the year both courses are wet.  Net, net: Stadium is an overpriced tourist trap and Champions is a modestly priced, slow playing, beer drinkers muni."}
{"text":"I will note staff very good.  Course just isn't in that great a shape and no god on carts you would expect for the price tag.  I prefer the Marriott course dessert ridge where we were staying."}
{"text":"Hubby had his tee time at this place and he liked it. I was just riding with him and i also enjoyed the place. It wasn't that hot while we're there. The staff talks to you and they're the ones who start the conversation which was really awesome. I find the place clean and in order and charming, you can really notice that's it's very well maintained. They also have great selections of golf wear and golf supplies and souvenirs. Hubby wanted to play here because of the PGA Tour, i don't play golf so this review is entirely based on my hubby's experience and it was great. :-) This place is also GREAT for pictures."}
{"text":"If you are not a \"Par\" golfer and ever want to play the #TPC Scottsdale, DON'T. They treated us like garbage because we weren't playing fast enough. Note: that we paid for 4 and only were a threesome. We explained that we are not good and this was a fathers day outing. They told us to either leave the course or play ahead a hole to \"catch\" up. I'm sorry we came in your off season to try the course out and are not good golfers- we still paid really good money to play the entire course, not to get pushed ahead or forced to leave if we didn't obey. they did offer to buy us a round of drinks to do so, but we were already done drinking by that time. we already invested $100 worth of beers from the beer lady... I wish we would have spent our $400 for the day elsewhere-Please share this story for any of you golfers out there. There are too many really awesome courses in Phx to have to deal with that bullshit. I will not be back and will tell as many people as I can about my experience."}
{"text":"Do not play the Champions Course!! It is terrible: 1.  Greens have burnt sections of sod sticking out 2.  Fairways are dried out , lumpy and not maintained 3.  There is no reduced green fee considering the extensive damaged areas to course  4.  No showers"}
{"text":"Took family from out of town to play this course. We paid over $200 each to play this course last week. The ranger was on us the entire round for being 4 minutes behind!... the 4-some behind us was two shots back and the ranger was continually pressing us and it was to the point where we had to run. This is not how golf is suppose to be played. The pace to play was 4hr and 15min. We finished in 4hr and 19min. Give us a break. Definitely won't be playing that course ever again for that price and service."}
{"text":"Beautiful course! I love the open layout...great for the waste management tournament. Hole #15 is by far my favorite! Work on your sand game before you play this course, because every hole except #1 has sand. I suggest playing right before or right after the tournament so you can get an amazing experience, with the stands up on hole #16."}
{"text":"Immaculate course that is challenging enough for good golfers and forgiving enough for beginners! Would love to see the stands left up year round on 16th for the full tour experience. Had Keith as the caddy and he was phenomenal and I would highly recommend him!"}
{"text":"Happy Mothers Day to an Alternate Olympic Sailing Team,300 bowler and maybe the best putter in the family Mom made me pass swimming lessons 2 times until stepping foot on the golf course because that's the way she was taught. We went here as kids where we had a picture take out front that I lost track of taken but this place is so memorable as my parents asked us where we wanted to go for spring break and Arizona was the choice it looked cool. Shot 74 at age 8 or 9. #sobrightyoucallmesun  enjoy the @nikewomen clothing and have a special day  LOVE RYLEY, X's and O's"}
{"text":"Course is okay, for the money there are way better courses in the scottsdale area. Understand if you must play it because you saw it on TV. Shot low round of my life here 71. Course Marshall is a real piece of work, finished in 3.75 hours had two girls with us so most likely jumped to conclusion we were playing slow. Greens are great, course layout is fun, way over priced.....oh and also you need to pay for practice balls....first course I've played since moving to the scottsdale area where that was the case. It should be your first clue that this course isn't the quality of wekopa,Troon, grayhawk, or quintero.  Spend your money at a better course."}
