{"text":"Best takeout on the east side.  Nothing fancy but solid and reliable."}
{"text":"iheart the dragon rolls!! #FIYAH"}
{"text":"This is an excellent \"to-go\" Chinese restaurant. The near dozens of times we have ordered here, everything was made correctly, tasted good and still hot. This is definitely the way to go if you're in the Solon, Warrensville or Bedford area and want a non-dining experience."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times by now. They have a nice buffet that you pay by the pound. The food is good but the place is not a nice place to stop for lunch or Dinner . My Advice is go get your Chinese here and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst most disrespectful place I have ever been to. They got my order completely wrong and after looking over the menu I was overcharged for the items they gave me"}
{"text":"When I entered Tangs for the first time I could not help but to notice that they store meat in plastic sink dishwashing pales in a large refrigerator with glass doors behind the counter. Eeeek. The place is a mess, but when my in laws are in town and I need to feed them, this is where I go... ;) wink"}
{"text":"I like this place. But I ate here yesterday and It made me sick. Won't go back. sorry."}
{"text":"Happen to be back home in Cleveland this past weekend and I knew exactly what I wanted for lunch. This is by far one of my favorite places to eat. They have an awesome lunch buffet deal from 11-2 that you pay by the pound. Options include general tso chicken, fried rice, lo mein noodles, etc. Staff has always been friendly."}
{"text":"Shady ass place . My total for the food was 19 and some change . I tipped them a dollar even though technically they didn't provide any service Bc I did the buffet box by the pound  , later I looked at my bank statement and they charge 22 bucks and some change . Also,  food as meh."}
{"text":"It's human nature for people to write reviews only when they have a bad experience, so I thought I'd offer my good experiences with this place. I have been a customer of Tang's Wok for several years now. I have never had a bad experience. Large menu and I have liked almost everything I've ever tried. Definitely never been sick like other reviewers. The kitchen area seems very clean but the little dining area could definitely use a good scrubbing. Anyways, long-time customer here and while I have had better Chinese take-out, I would definitely recommend anyone trying it the place at least once."}
{"text":"This is our favorite take out Chinese spot. The service is awesome and they have a great menu. The homemade iced tea is great!!!!"}
