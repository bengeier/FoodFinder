{"text":"Been here a handful of times since they've opened.  It was busy 4 of the 5 times we went (Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening visits). If you have a group, make reservations because otherwise you'll be packed into a corner sharing a table with 2 or 3 people.   Waffles and crepes were really good. I had a waffle topped with fruit and a scoop of their vanilla ice cream (which I heard was made in house, not commercial brand). Very good! My friend has the crepe with chocolate ice cream with chocolate sauce - also very good!  Another occasion we had the hot chocolate with a slice of chocolate cake. Hot chocolate was really good. The cake slice was huge. I feel that they could reduce the price (which was pricy as is!) and serve a smaller portion. This is definitely a \"share\" sized piece of cake - but you're stuck with just one variety if you're with a date. Table beside us had a group of 3 who ordered 3 slices and left about half of their cake behind.   They sometimes have entertainment - Bollywood dancers, band, themed parties, which is a nice change from the normal dessert places."}
{"text":"Best Dessert place. Food, service and Quality beat Cafe Demetres and other dessert places. Visitors and Resident of GTA - you MUST try this place."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to dining at the D-Spot, but I've never been more sorely DISAPPOINTED. To start off, the server got our order wrong: there were two of us at the table, but for some reason, he thought we had ordered only one entré and brought just mine to the table . Secondly, the salad was old, with stale croutons and tasty bits of dirt in the creases. Third, the Hawaiian crepe had uncooked bacon and bland chicken pieces in it. And to top it all off, the \"crepe\" wasn't even a crepe! No crispness, all soft...like a pancake!!!!  We complained and were told we didn't need to pay for the main entrés, which we thought was reasonable. But when I asked to speak to the manager to advise him/her about the quality of the food, I was told there was no manager on site this evening. How is this even possible??!!  Never going back again."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about this place I decided to check it out.  I ordered a Nutella waffle which was nothing special and my friend ordered a molten chocolate chip cookie.  The cookie was stale and you could tell it had been reheated multiple times.  This place just isn't worth visiting.  Disappointing experience, don't understand the hype around this place. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great waffles. Satisfied my late evening sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and shrimp crepe. It was good, though the sauce was a bit on the sweet side, which I'm not a big fan of. I ordered a strawberry banana smoothie and it was awful. It was overly sweet, and tasted like cheap McDonald's smoothie. Certainly wasn't worth the price. The ambiance was casual. The bench seats are too short and uncomfortable. I felt like I was going to fall off the whole time. Someone with long legs would have to sit on the chairs. We went on a Friday evening and the place was packed. I would go again.  I went back and tried their pizzas and I was impressed! They were super cheesy, the portion size was enough to eat and take more than half home, and the flavours were so satisfying. Also had the Hazelnut Macchiato. I would have preferred it to be a bit less sweet but that's just me. The whip cream was yummy."}
{"text":"D-disappointed. 5 of my friends I and wanted to grab coffee and dessert at 10:15pm on Easter Monday. We were turned away because they were closing early since it was not busy.... Advertised closing time Midnight. Definitely not going back there again.  They just lost some good business."}
{"text":"Server assigned to us was really nice.she gave us enough time to decide and made sure we enjoyed our stay. We love her accent and her way of talking! ;)    We got excited with the menu. They served it pretty fast. We ordered the 1.)white chocolate lava cake-this one we really like. 2.) Banana Nutella crepes- nothing special with this. Just your straight up banana and Nutella ( diluted in water to make it a little runny syrup) 3.) Nachos- chips itself taste good. it could have been better if cheese were still melting when served. We feel that it was prepared way before that it cheese hardened and that makes it weird.  We went there for our usual Wednesday girls night and we were glad it wasn't crowded. It has modern industrial ambiance. Locations was a little hidden though. I won't find it if no told me there is a cafe in that area."}
{"text":"We brought some friends who are visiting from abroad ...  We had ordered few items  -nachos   -vanilla lava cake -strawberry cheesecake  -poutine  (2 different types) -few hot drinks   -chicken something salad  I can't remember all the names of the dish. Sorry.  Overall food was good and desserts were large enough for 2 people to share unless you really want it for yourself .   We were seated within few minutes .. it was busy buy not super packed as other nights .   We went close to closing time  and we're slightly disappointed that we had 2 differnt waitress serve us our food and didn't get our food all at once but one at a time . Mind yiu there still people coming in at 11:30 when the store is to closde at 12 midnight . Other Than small thing we were satisfied with the service and the food .   I usually like to tey out a place with a clear mind and with no ones opinions stuck in my head ... so i say Do try it out for yourself with a open mind .... that goes for all restaurants ! :)"}
{"text":"Service was awful... Might as well put a sign that said self-serve. Perhaps they were understaffed but we had to ask a waitress for a seat. Didn't even get a menu (again had to ask). We had no confidence in our order coming out so had to periodically ask waitress if it was even placed!   Nice attempt to be an alternative to Demetre's, but pictures of deserts on menu were not appealing (not that the actual cakes were better..)  Ordered the d spot signature dish: two waffles with chocolate syrup in between stacked with brownies and ice cream. $20! You're paying for the quantity vs quality.   Would not recommend to anyone...."}
{"text":"Always drove past it but tonight decidedly to try this place ... awesome service! Deeeelicious crepes the strawberry and cream and generous portion so much so it was shared! Excellent latte, I'll be certain to return! Great value for fun delicious deserts and savoury good eats!"}
{"text":"Tried their cookies and cream cake and maaaaan that was disappointing. It was super crusty and dry.   They serve tap water too so I couldn't even get rid of the taste.   My friend has the tandoori chicken poutine and she said that was good. Wish I chose that."}
{"text":"I ordered the big cookie with ice cream and chocolate drizzle (the name is escaping me). The cookie on its own was dry and tasted like the dough was previously frozen but with the ice cream and chocolate sauce in one bite, it was a delicious combo. I also got a cup of milk on the side because I thought it would add to the taste but it doesn't really. I can't say this is their best dessert and it's certainly expensive considering the taste of the isolated cookie.  However, they get an extra star in this review because the service is great and their waffles and crepes were delicious the last time I tried."}
{"text":"This place is always over crowded and packed not cause so they have good deserts ..:::it's actually cause it's the only place open till late night in this area. People tend to come here for late night gossips."}
{"text":"Came here on a monday night and it was quite busy. Tables were left uncleaned but service was quick and we got our food promptly. I ordered the triple chocolate brownie and it was served with a mound of ice cream.   The brownie was warm and soft and paired well with the ice cream. Its what you would think a triple chocolate brownie.   Overall a good place to hang out with your friends with average desserts."}
{"text":"The desserts are nothing special and they were definitely overpriced. The waitress added gratuity to our bills without informing us when it was time to pay. Which of course meant we tipped her twice. She never mentioned anything at any point during our stay and I asked her to return my extra tip. I will not be returning. Also, the menus had a bad smell to them which is pretty gross."}
{"text":"Like this place.... food are amazing. Good service... nice atmosphere.. they also have tv to watch... clean restaurant. Very nice will come back again..."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends around 7-8 ish pm wanting to satisfy our sweet tooth and to finish off the day out with them with a sugar high and full bellies.   The place had a cool and edgy interior, with circular themes all around. We came in and I was quite surprised that there weren't a lot of people - maybe 2 tables of couples when we came in? It was kinda quiet too. Maybe the busy hours aren't until later when movie go-ers finish watching stuff from the movie theater near by.  We came in and I didn't really get a good vibe from the staff.  We were seated at the round booth which I thought was really comfy and roomy. She definitely wasn't as enthusiastic and cheery as I expected from dessert places. She did kept checking in on us which was nice, but we didn't stay too long.   Friends and I ordered their NY-Style Cheesecake with strawberries and strawberry sauce, and they also ordered the chocolate lava cake and another cheesecake for take-out (Will talk about those take-out items later). The cheesecake was dense just the way I liked it, and the tartness of the strawberries balanced the sweetness of the sauce and the cake. We ordered this one because it caught our attention on their menu photo, which had a lot more strawberries than the one presented to us. I wish the slice was a bit bigger considering we paid $9+ for one slice. Overall kinda underwhelming in consideration of previous cheesecakes I've had, the menu photo, and the price. 4/10.  We also ordered their nachos, which came with cheese, jalapeno peppers, bell peppers, onions; the usual things on nachos. Came also with  2 mini sour cream, and 2 salsa sauce bowls. We decided to add bacon to our nachos, which is additional cost. The course itself was okay; I've had cheesier, hotter, and tastier nachos, but I liked how it was a 3-flavoured/coloured nacho chips that they used. Definitely added to the colour visuals of the plate. By the end of our stay there my mouth was burning like crazy from the jalapenos and there was no re-filled water glasses to be found.  The take-out items were okay... but I don't think we'll be doing take-out here anymore because of the high price for just the slices/lava cake. No plating/decor/whipped cream/ice cream/sauces with the take-out.   This place is most suited for dining in and eating their desserts. Maybe I'll come back for those and their specialty drinks."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had been wanting to try this place for a while, since we love going to demetres, I thought we would try it out. 4 of us went on a Thursday night, we got there around 10:30pm for a late night snack... there wasn't really much of a crowd, so we were seated somewhat promptly. They have a decently large selection of things to choose from, but we opted for the desserts of course, the first thing I noticed is that the prices were different from their website I had looked at earlier in the day (I'm one of those people who check the menu prior so I'm not taking forever when I'm actually there) I know the economy keeps changing but I was a bit annoyed, I think it had been around a dollar off so I let it slide. We had been waiting for at least 15-20 min just for someone to take our order, as there was only one waitress but 3-4 other staff members behind the counter. She took our order, and the food was given to us within a reasonable time (all delivered at separate timings though), the food is good I'm not gonna lie, and I was surprised to see the portion sizing is very large (I would definitely recommend sharing, we had no idea they would be this big) but good none the less. We then waited at least another 20-30 min for the bill (within this time there were many people being seated, also, there had been a few parties who came after us, got their food and left before us), so my friend had to go up to the counter to actually ask for her to bring the bills. We paid, but when I looked at my receipt, it had seemed that the prices had increased yet again from the menu that I looked at in the restaurant, so I questioned it and she kind of gave me a look that made me second guess myself and feel stupid, so I let it be and paid anyways. I paid in cash, she asked me if I wanted change and I said yes, she then proceeded to give me a dollar less than what I was supposed to be given, I'm not sure if she couldn't calculate the simple math or if she was given herself a tip from my change, but this just put me over the edge. I'm not sure if this is because of the timing we went at that it seemed short staffed or if it's normally like this, but other than the food being decent, I did not have a good experience."}
{"text":"So so so yummy! Great dining and great food. Tough place to find even with GPS lol. What I like is they have dessert and dinner food too. 5 star. who doesn't love dessert?!"}
{"text":"After going to Friday Service at church (nearby). Me and my mom decided to have dessert. We were between this spot and the competition nearby called premium dessert, or something like that ( I could not find it on yelp). We saw more people on this spot, so we came here. And me and my mom are so glad we did.   We got help from the host (which is a young lady from guinea, quite exotic place) on choosing what to pick from their extensive menu. We got seated right away even though place was uber-superly packed. The waiter helped us further along choosing a dessert.   We ended choosing \"Something to Talk about\", which was delicious. We actually can taste the is hazlenut of the ice cream. I would say that it is a monumental, overly generous amount of ice cream, which was great. It made me feel that I was getting my moneys worth (I think the plate was like 12-13 bucks).  I was very observant of the place, it was popping.   Before leaving, the owner of the location (dude is only 24 years old and super succesful) came to our table to check we enjoyed our experience here, it was awesome.   I can absolutely tell that the whole staff works in a team, takes orders correctly, brought our food right away, and incredible service.   I have to be very specific and give a shout out to the host that sits you down. She is absolutely amazing and hard worker. I hogged her to help me chose a dessert, and even then, she was able to handle incoming traffic, sit people, clean different tables quickly and detailed-ly. You can tell that she cared about the place as if it was her own. Absolutely incredible Service!  Easily coming back here before my journey back home  Ken"}
{"text":"Great interior with average food and good deserts. The servers are friendly. Especially a place for young adults! The place does have the potential to become the best dessert place in Scarborough. Best wishes."}
{"text":"This is a place that can be a hit or a miss. Their sundaes and milkshakes are really good! Fair warning, some of the dessert are massive so you might want to ask the server how big a dessert is before ordering!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place especially for the younger crowd. Ambiance is very nice. We had the chocolate lava cake which was amazing. We also had a waffle dessert (Hit D Spot) which was massive(my kid was obsessed). Portions are huge so you can easily split a dessert between 2 or 3 or sometimes even 4 people. Definitely a place you'd wanna try out at least once if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The service here has def gotten better, which was a serious flaw about this place before. The dessert has always been good so no complaints there. I haven't had the actual food so I can't speak for that but the desserts are great."}
{"text":"Lmao not gonna lie, me cousins and I were very skeptical about coming here. The name sounded kinda sketchy, and some reviews were terrible. BUT, we decided to just try it out cause why not. I really recommend coming to D-Spot!! The dessert here is amazing. I got the New York cheesecake, my cousin got a crepe and my other cousin got this brownie. The whole place itself was very modern, new and clean. Loved the vibe and the food :) d-spot is definitely a hidden jem."}
{"text":"Went to check out the place and to be honest I was satisfied with the portions and pricing. The food quality, presentation of desserts and iced-drinks were pretty good. Only mattering concern is the customer service. Although, we had some ice cream and couple of iced drinks and we were served without any napkins. We had to ask for napkins when almost we were done with the food. The server's attire was not clean enough. I understand they work hard but a decent cafe server should also try to dress up nicely. Nevertheless, no complaint about the food but lack of efficiency in customer service can hamper their popularity and ratings big time."}
{"text":"Slice of ice cream anyone? so this is comparable somewhat to Demetres. You're looking at similar dessert selections and drinks (cold/hot). What Demetres tops over this place is presentation.  You're mostly liking at crepes, waffles, Apple pie and a few slices of a variety of cakes. Nothing to write home about.   I literally got slices of ice cream- not scoops. I think they got the chapmans ice cream from the cardboard box and went at it with a knife. Hmm ...a little weird but dessert is dessert.  I wouldn't trek out here, but if this is the closest late night dessert spot to you, then do check it out."}
{"text":"The place is always super packed when I go and customer service isn't really there you kind of have to catch your waiter at the beginning, if you need something after you will have to chase them and the place is really noisy (during the weekend at night).   I had a waffle with cookie dough and chocolate shavings, overall pretty good maybe a little too sweet. The item that makes this place a bit more unique than your other typical dessert places I think is they really load on the toppings and they give you a side bowl of hot chocolate sauce to drizzle onto your waffle. Other than that it's just okay. They have some cool combos and some super waffle for like $30 if you're down!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place after seeing many pictures of dessert all over my social media. It definitely didn't disappointment. My friend and I went here spontaneously and we loved it. We had amazing service from our waiter (Hedi I think his name was). He was very friendly and welcoming and constantly checked up on us. We ordered the waffle with the pistachio ice cream (I forget the name now).  It is definitely enough to share.  It was not overwhelming sweet but still satisfied our sweet tooth.  I ordered the London grey latte and it was tasteful. I could go to this place just to have that latte again. My friend got the green tea and said it was really good.    The atmosphere was okay. Different age ranges from toddlers to elderly. I liked how we got a booth tucked into a corner. I think the interior could be made more cozy but other than that no complaints.   Great service.  Great dessert. Great prices."}
{"text":"Huge portions for a reasonable price. Definitely a good spot for a date. Would suggest ordering one dessert for two people."}
{"text":"I visited here with friends during the day during the week so it was pretty quiet.  They are known for their large dessert servings which you can definitely share with at least one other person.  I didn't manage to finish mine on my own.  We ordered the Cookielicious and Nuts for Peanuts crepe.  Both desserts were presented well and tasted yummy.  Such a great restaurant if you have a sweet tooth!    Despite really enjoying the desserts, the service is not good.  My friend ordered a coffee and the waitress didn't come by to offer more coffee nor did she stop by the table at all - not even when it was clear we were finished and might want our bill.  As mentioned, the place wasn't busy so there is no reason for the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"So I must admit, I don't have a lot of experience with desserts, so take this with that in mind.   The place was always visible when we finished the movie from the nearby Cineplex and never tried. On a whim, my wife wanted to have dessert and we thought we would finally tried this place out. The place looks good inside and is in the plaza which is still relatively vacant.   We ordered the red velvet waffle, chocolate nut waffle, and the Canadian pizza for the family to share.  For drinks we had the man-go wild and hot chocolate. The waffles are big and the ice cream they top it up with is even bigger.  The waffle was freshly made and made very well, not too hard but not too soft either.  The ice was delicious and not overly sweet. After struggling to finish both waffles, we looked at each other and both had that look of hindsight. Should have shared 1 instead of ordering 2 of these.  The pizza was thin crust and a good small size. My kids loved every bite of it, so it must have been good.  The mango drink was great and would recommend to anyone big on mango.   Overall a very good dessert place."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite dessert place in Scarborough. Everything about this place is awesome from the interior to the desserts. I cannot comment on the food as I've only ordered dessert here.   Over the years I've tried lots of things on the menu but for my most recent visit we got a chocolate mocha ice cream waffle and the cookie cake (forgot the exact names) but both were awesome. The waffle was warm and fresh out of the waffle maker and the ice cream was blended perfectly with the nuts and chocolate curls. The portions here are extremely generous as there's no way one person can finish everything (or maybe I'm underestimating you guys ?). This place is an awesome place to hang out with some delicious desserts would highly recommend to all"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I visited a Spin, and I was quite looking forward to going there after our movie last night. Unfortunately, we've found out that this is no longer a Spin and is now called D Spot. We still decided to check it out. Pretty glad we did. It's basically Spin, down to the same menus, but under a new name. It's a bit bootleg, they've covered \"Spin\" on the menu with a Velcro sign saying D Spot... Aside from that the food is still good. Tried the butter chicken pizza, which could have been really bad but was actually pretty good. Tried the Turtle cheesecake and the Hazelnut cheesecake (with legit chocolate ice cream) and the hazelnut ice cream. Desserts are definitely as decadent as I recall from previous visits to other Spin locations. Not really sure what happened, to cause the name change, but for Spin lovers, D Spot is still a viable option!"}
{"text":"This is one of the only cafes I know about in Scarborough that are open late at night.   It's perfect for those midnight cravings, or simply if you and your girlfriends have a sweet tooth.   The environment is relatively casual, being located in a newly developed plaza. They play modern music that makes you enjoy your sitting a lot more and keeps the environment lively.  With a wide range of desserts they also serve other meals such as savoury crepes, salads, pizzas and more.   Overall, my rating is based on the hours of the location and the range of cake flavours served."}
{"text":"Service here was very mediocre. Even when it is never packed, staff are absent and talked loudly to each other more than servicing customers the two times I visited. Messy tables left as they were until the end of the night.  Good thing is they carry mint chocolate chunk ice cream to go with your waffles and crepes. Demetres stopped carrying mint flavour a long time ago when I craved their decadent deadly desserts for my sweet tooth so its good that they offer them here. Not bad if you are in the area, an OK place for dessert and opens late too.  They replaced the Spin Dessert Cafe that used to be here (or maybe just re-branded)."}
{"text":"The deserts are so damn delicious!!! Can't wait to go back. I've tried their crepes, cheesecake and \"your crepe ate my brownie\" .... Portions are pretty big so it's good to share."}
{"text":"The 15 is great, the wife loves the Rockyroad waffle. Definitely a great brunch lunch dinner dessert place. It's almost a ritual for us every 2-3 weeks we have to go."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and it's not my favourite place. Mediocre desserts and crappy service. Atmosphere is nice, that's about it.   Definitely my last time visiting here after our experience with a rude waitress. She had so much attitude answering a simple question we had about a menu item. Never checked in on us, nothing. If I had it in me to give a $0 tip I honestly would have. Won't catch me back here."}
{"text":"We came here after watching a movie and we're craving dessert/hungry. But knowing that this is no longer spin dessert made me sad. It is definitely quiet and a lot of emptiness then it was before. However there were people coming in. If you came here when it was spin you have to try your best and have an open mind. Yes they are reusing the old menu covers and covered the old embossed logo with a Velcro patch (was not very impressed with that). They have kept some of the original items and have reprinted it in a different layout/colour scheme. I'm not really sure how comparable all of the new food is to the old place is. My friends ordered pizza(which did look quite on par with the old offerings), turtle cheesecake, chocolate cheesecake (?) which was a good serving with plenty of ice cream. The prices seem to be similar, and the taste of everything is really good. Good quiet place to grab dessert and share, very generous with the servings. Try not to compare with old company even though it will be hard not to. The service is good and our waitress made sure to keep our cups full. Probably would come back due to the offerings being tasty and generous."}
{"text":"Returned to D Spot today and ordered chipotle poutine and my wife got the veggie pizza.  The poutine was surprisingly really good! The gravy was delicious and mixed with the chipotle chicken.  The pizza was amazing and we were very surprised how great the food was considering this place is known for desserts! For Dessert we had to share a chocolate lava cake considering how full we were.  But we had to end the night with something sweet.  The service was amazing we had 2 different servers constantly check up on us and was a very friendly atmosphere.  The staff here are very friendly.  This Spot will be our regular go to spot!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a casual spot for a good slice of cake or personal pizza, I highly recommend this place!   I took my parents and fiancé on a random Wednesday night and this place was POPPING. Friends catching up, groups celebrating...something.... other families - this place was filled with diverse patrons.   This time we only got dessert - a waffle with fresh fruit, a waffle with mango ice cream, and a crepe with butterscotch. All three were devoured within 10 minutes!!! Really delicious. I had been here previously and my brother-in-law enjoyed the pizza and affogato (hazelnut ice cream was on point).   The people are really friendly. And the place is non-pretentious. The only reason I didn't give it a full five is because I'm always cold when I come here! I think it could be a bit cozier but maybe of we sat in a booth it would have been fine!   Definitely recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Visited this D-Spot location late on Sunday evening. We were starving after an event downtown and were looking for something that was open at 11pm.   Despite it being primarily a dessert café, we were pleasantly surprised to see that there were a variety of savoury items on the menu. We ordered 2 pizzas (Hawaiian Heat & You Can't Handle Me Spicy) to share between 4 of us. The pizzas were amazing, very fresh ingredients, lots of flavour and large chunky pieces of chicken - highly recommend!  The service was impeccable and the waiters were super friendly. We were touched to have the owner come out to see us and when discovering that we had come from Montreal, he brought us a 'Spicy Tandoori Chicken Poutine' on the house! This too was bursting with flavour - cheesy fries topped with tandoori chicken, drowning in the signature house gravy and sour cream - it was heavenly!  The Star of the Show however has to be the enormous 'Hit D Spot' dessert. A massive stack of waffles topped with ice cream, fudge, chocolate sauce, chunky brownie pieces, chocolate pieces, cream and almonds. Our kind waiter Shazane also threw in some cookie dough pieces (as I was unable to make up my mind between desserts) which was lovely. All of us devoured every single mouth-watering bite - it truly was sensational!  From the excellent service and warm welcome and hospitality by owner Haroon, to the mouth-watering treats and delights, D-Spot has quickly become our favourite dessert spot in Toronto and we will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Walked in expecting a not-so-good experience based on the yelp ratings, but I was actually quite surprised.  We went on Christmas eve and this was one of the few places that were open. Despite the fact that they were completely packed, we were seated within 5 minutes. Our server looked after us properly, yes he almost brought the wrong order to us once, but I can't blame him because there were just too many people.   This has a very demtre's vibe to it, with a south-asian touch. We had butter chicken crepe, it wasn't as good as I was expecting, but it wasn't bad either. Waffle and ice-cream was ok, the cheesecake was pretty delicious, on of the very best i have had, i can't recall the flavour exactly (i believe it was chocolate)  In short, I have been here once on a very busy day, and I have nothing but good things to say about my experience."}
{"text":"Very good food and great ambiance. I would definitely come back again! The food will fill you up in the most satisfying way"}
{"text":"This place is perfect for kids and young adults who can handle the sugar rush you get from their HUGE desserts. Overheard the young men next to us planning to split a dessert three ways, that gives you an idea on how big they are.  I've outgrown my sweet tooth a loooong time ago but hubby still has his and nurses it periodically. You need to wait to be seated, lots of available tables on a Monday night. Decor looks like an adult version of an ice cream parlour (see pic). Noisy crowd with Miley Cyrus playing in the background and blenders whirring away.  Ordered the twisted chocolate shake (had a shot of espresso) and hubby had the apple pie pancakes. The pancakes were dense and dry and the cooked apples had pieces of apple peel in it. Could not handle the sugar overload.  Pluses: close to the movie theatre and open late with free Wifi."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple friends months ago, back when this place was called spin cafe and really didn't like the food. It was too sugary and dry. However, I came here again recently as I was in the area and was pleasantly surprised by the difference in taste.   I ordered an oreo waffle which costed about $12 and wasn't able to finish it because it was too large. It was very tasty and filling, however I don't think it was worth the price. The thing about this cafe is that they don't necessarily make anything... the just buy a bunch of premade foods (like oreos, two bite brownies, whipped cream, etc) and then put it together. I totally could've made this at home for half the price.   On top of that, I was a little disappointed that I had to leave my leftovers in the cafe instead of taking them home for later. The problem is that the ice cream would've melted and ruined the waffle so I was forced to waste food. Perhaps in the future I'll ask them to give me the ice cream separately??  Also as a side note, I saw some other reviewers mention that this place was reusing old menus but covering up the logo... but when I came here I was given brand new menus with new item names so don't worry about that."}
{"text":"I really don't know what's up with all of these reviews. I have been to d-spot several times now and I have received quality treatment each time. The desserts here are delicious, and the service has been kind each time, even going so far as to remember our order when we walk in."}
{"text":"Disappointment. One word sums up my experience here. Perhaps this wasn't the place for a dessert that tastes like a dessert, but rather an over abundance of pomp and circumstance with superfluous servings.  For a party of 4, I was glad that we were seated promptly...but about 10 minutes in the line ups started. Needless to say this was a popular establishment, although why I could not say. Given my very frequent visits to other dessert establishments, I opted for a crepe. Do not ever order a crepe. I ordered \"something to talk about\" and oh boy did we have something to talk about! The egg and dough taste was extremely overpowering and I could not taste the supposed hazelnut ice cream. I needed to steal bites of a chocolate lava cake nearby to allow for some sweetness. The hot chocolate was ordered as a drink...but I think it was mixed up as an order of \"whipped cream with a drop or two of hot chocolate\". Ok I exaggerate, but seriously! Ease up a bit on the whip. I understand that these desserts wish to make a statement. I understand that there is the need to impress with swirls and swirls of chocolate and cream and toppings galore. Perhaps that is the customer base one is looking for here, but unfortunately that does not include me. I'll be heading back to Demetres."}
{"text":"Huge quantities but not very good quality. The pancakes were very heavy, like undercooked and not airy at all. The music was a little too loud until we asked for it to be turned down. And it was cold in that restaurant. The waitress seemed in a hurry (although we were the only customers!) and didn't even ask if we wanted drinks."}
{"text":"A local version of Demetres with a couple more savory food options to have for dinner before dessert. Came on a Saturday night and there were many tables with large parties, so expect it to be crowded and loud. Also, there were alot of kids despite the late hour. I only had a drink, but my dining companion had a full meal and was happy with it. It was substantial enough for a lunch portion the next day also. A easy place to go grab something sweet and chat, but expect to wait for a table at peak hours."}
{"text":"Let me make this very clear to anyone who goes to this dessert spot: SHARE YOUR DISH WITH SOMEONE. You will not finish one whole dish by yourself, I promise! Anyways, I got the Birthday Cake sundae thing. It had two scoops of birthday cake ice cream with sprinkles on a waffle cone, with white sauce to drizzle on top on the side. I hardly used the sauce because I knew it'd be too sweet with it. I just ate the ice cream but it had a weird texture to it--it wasn't smooth like ice cream is supposed to be. My partner got the Big Cookie dessert that consists of vanilla ice cream with chocolate drizzle on top of a giant chocolate chip cookie. The cookie itself was really good (and very, very big) and even better paired with the ice cream. However, drizzling the chocolate sauce on top was a bit too much and I would ask to omit it if I were to go again. Of course, neither me or my partner finished our desserts. He did package his leftover cookie up, though. The service is average and the place is pretty normal, lots of seating and located in a quiet plaza. When I visited I heard Despacito THREE times within 20 minutes-so I kind of don't like the music they play. It's worth a visit for all the dessert lovers out there."}
{"text":"Second time at D Spot in the last year, and it was just as impressive as the first time.  This is a very popular place in the neighbourhood, especially after a movie lets out from the nearby theatre.   Always pretty busy and packed on weekend evenings. The decor is satisfying, the tables serve their purpose. The staff have to rearrange the tables often to seat different groups. It's really a nice treat to score one of the two huge corner circular booths especially if you have a group of 4-6 people.   I ordered the \"Warm and loving\" waffle. It was well worth it! The ice cream was piled high, good amount of whipped cream and white chocolate curls. They even include a nice little side serving of warm caramel sauce to add on if I wished.   Service was quick, staff were friendly and helpful with accommodating our request for a table away from the front entrance.   Overall, this spot is definitely somewhere to check out if you're looking for a nice place in Scarborough to have dessert!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place and unfortunately left pretty disappointed.    The servers were friendly and attentive, however it was the food that we took issue with and its overall value to us as customers.  The drinks were tasty but at $7 a glass, and a fairly small one at that, you would expect them to use higher end ingredients or just give you more product.  My husband, who previously worked in the food industry,  estimated that his banana and strawberry milkshake probably did not contain a whole banana as it was quite thin in consistency and as stated above, the glass was quite small. They also do not use real whipped cream for their topping, we saw the can sitting on the counter.  Next were the nachos.  They were $14 and although they used really nice tortilla chips the toppings were sparse.  There was probably only cheese on 10 chips and random other toppings like green pepper and olives sprinkled around.  Half the cheese was also burnt.  The plate just looked like they threw a pile of tortilla chips on it and got distracted while adding the toppings and forgot to cover all the chips.  We were going to get dessert as well but after seeing the price decided against it.  $10 for a slice of cheesecake is absolutely ridiculous.  Even places that make the cake in store, in front of you do not charge that.  We ended up going to Walmart and getting an entire cherry cheesecake and a box of strawberries for the same price as a single slice from here.  Overall, the food and drinks were okay but for what you get they are very over priced."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. I usually always get the waffle with the hazelnut ice cream. Always delicious. Their food other than desserts aren't that great. I based this rating on that one dessert I usually get along with their overall atmosphere. It's a nice place and the price is okay for the portion size (I can't usually finish the whole thing). They do seem understaffed though, but the customer service for the times I've visited were great."}
{"text":"would not recommend to anyone even for the people to work for this company. the food is over priced and the quality is not good. save your money and get dessert from somewhere else. the other negative reviews is as true as it gets."}
{"text":"the menu is great. no matter what was ordered by company or myself-- everything looked beautiful, and tasted just as nice. the portions are always generous and great for sharing.  the service isn't something i'm particularly satisfied with. they don't seem to keep enough people present during shifts; so despite there not being many other customers when we went, we were checked on and served quite leisurely.  nevertheless, i would still go back. good ambiance and cute desserts. a nice little place to satisfy a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Friday night. Got the last table around 9 and then it was packed until we left. Had a pizza and a day and night waffle. The pizza was small, powdery and tasted like frozen pizza but that was expected. The dessert was gigantic. Barely able to finish it with two people. Prob made for three. Portion size was definitely nice to see. A bit on the pricy side but if the portions stay large over time, worth the visit."}
{"text":"Good, clean restaurant. Great for casual dining, and desserts. The staff are attentive, and polite. Would recommend the lava cake, best thing ever!"}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken poutine and the cookie dough pancakes. The poutine was amazing. The gravy was incredible. Tasted like deliciousness. The pancakes had cookie dough, chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream on top. They were the best pancakes I have had. I still dream about them. They make me feel complete. They make me feel whole again. Like there was a void in my life that I didn't know existed. A void that was filled when I tasted the sweet deliciousness of a warm pancake mixed with the perfect blend of syrups and cold vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people are hating on this place, it's a cute little cafe, mainly for dessert. I was feeling savory the last time I went so I had their mexican crepe and it was absolutely delicious! Although I ordered ceasar salad with it, it ended up getting wasted simply because it was too much and really not that good ! Haha, definitely going again! Their pizza was whatever but I did enjoy the crepe!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Even water is filtered here!  Great atmosphere, tasty deserts!  Prices are moderate."}
{"text":"I come by here often usually for their coffee drinks and dessert with friends and family. Anything off their ice cream and cake menu is good and service has always been amazing!"}
{"text":"This place was really cool, open late night and pretty trendy it seemed like since they were at capacity all night. They had 3 chocolate fountains for dark milk and white chocolate and so of course I had to order something that included all three. We ordered 2 chocolate waffles for the table and I basically ate both and asked for extra of all three chocolates. It was amazing. We also got a Nutella strawberry bannana crepe which was good. They know their desserts!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting this place and it has definitely improved. We ordered the chocolate heaven on a waffle and strawberry shortcake + espresso. The food was great but I felt that the service was lacking. Perhaps they didn't expect it to be so busy on a Wednesday night? But our glasses of water remained empty once finished and were never refilled. We had to ask for more water and for our bill. Once we received our bill we weren't sure if we would need to go up to the front to pay or if they'd be bringing us the debit machine. Overall, we enjoyed the desserts but the service can definitely improve. Our server was very nice and welcoming but she seemed a bit overwhelmed."}
{"text":"This use to be another dessert place with a similar layout so I was intrigued to see if their menu was different and tasted better than the last.  Price Range (Not including tax and tip) - $5-$10 for drinks. $8-$15 for desserts. I'd say the price is very similar if not a tad bit cheaper than other dessert places like Demetres.   Food Quality (Taste, Portion Size, Menu) - 4/5 They have a really large dessert menu with so many different ice cream options, I was pretty impressed. They offer food too but I only had the dessert. I had the Belgian Hot Chocolate which was around $6 and I was skeptical at first but it tasted amazing and was pretty huge too. It was really rich in flavour. I also had the \"Undercover Nut Crepe\" (Pistachio Ice Cream with Pistachio curls) and it was so good, pretty filling and the ice cream was bomb. It was a large serving so I'm glad I split it with a friend. It definitely hit the spot for my sweet tooth.   Atmosphere -4/5 It has a really fun, family/friend vibe. I like the design of the place, has a kind retro look to it. It gets pretty busy on weekend nights so you might have to wait a bit. I always love the music they have playing in the background, its not too loud so its perfect if you just want to chill somewhere and talk. They have a decent amount of seating, I'd say its ideal for a group of 4. They have their own parking lot so parking is easy.   Service - 5/5 All the waiters/waitresses are really nice and and friendly. They come regularly to check on you to make sure everything is good and to see if you need more water. They usually give realistic wait times. Orders come out at a reasonable time, never had to wait long for it. They do a pretty good job at describing their stuff and giving recommendations so if you're ever stuck, feel free to ask them!   Would I go there again? For sure! It's starting to become my default late night Scarbz dessert place when I want a basic, filling desserts.   Lash's Recommendations  Belgian Hot Chocolate - It's really rich and there is a lot, so if you're feeling like something sweet and comforting, this is your drink!   Undercover Nut Crepe - If you love pistachios, definitely try this! It's huge, so unless you're really hungry, split this with a friend!"}
{"text":"Been here many of times always great desserts with my two homey champions will continue to come here till the owner throw US out."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and find it simply OK.   I wouldn't recommend the food. The pizza is always burnt for me at the bottom which is a huge disappointment. The cheesy fries are good but for $8+ it's totally not worth it.   The desserts are good but if I were comparing to Demetres I'd rather just go there because the pricing at D Spot doesn't seem to be worth what you get. I really like the ice cream at d spot though, tastes very fresh.  Tip: Share! We paid $25 for a waffle with icecream that could've totally been shared amongst 2-3 people if you don't have a crazy sweet tooth."}
{"text":"First off, service here is great! If you're here for dessert you'll be satisfied with their delicious chocolate and waffles or crepes. I would opt to skip on the savoury here. The chicken burrito I had was not good, the chicken was too dry and it was lacking filling. The pizza had a good amount of cheese but it's nothing special and for the price I wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"Dessert:  Day and night waffle: 3 stars Cookie monster crepe: 3 stars  The waffles and crepes are a good size for sharing, unless you're planning to skip dinner, it's pretty tough to finish one on your own.  This place is pretty much like Caffe Demetre. Menu loaded with sweets.  My cookie monster crepe came with quite a few bite-sized brownies and chunks of cookie dough. Crepe was wrapped around a mound of vanilla ice cream. Eat it quick or it gets soggy and kind of gross real fast unless melted ice cream crepe is your calling. Tried a bit of my friend's day and night waffle. I liked the cookies and cream ice cream and the waffle was just the right amount of softness. Would probably recommend the waffle over the crepe, but it is entirely up to preference.  Ambiance: 3 stars Bright and spacious. Came here on a Sunday and it was pretty busy but we still got a table pretty quickly. This place is a little harder to find because it's not actually part of the big Warden and Eglinton plaza, it's located in the plaza with a HSBC. I believe it is behind Michael's.  Service: 3 stars Our server was nice and polite. We got our desserts promptly after ordering and he checked up on us occasionally."}
{"text":"Ordered a red velvet cheesecake and the New York style cheesecake  I'll start with the New York style cheesecake. Delicious. With Japanese cheesecake taking the GTA by storm, new York style cheese cakes are becoming a memory of the past. But they shouldn't be. Japanese cheesecakes are inferior. This was a nice dense but soft cheesecake. The strawberries and strawberry sauce and cheesecake had a perfect balance. Nothing overpowering the other, very complimentary.  The red velvet cheesecake was very interesting. Normally, the flavours are all blended in together, but this cake had flavours separated. If you just ate the red cake part, it tastes like chocolate cake. But if you combine it with the Center cheesecake cross section, then you get the full red velvet flavour. Very interesting take on red velvet.   Servings are pretty big. Location was a bit hard to find though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last month and I will not go back. On both occasions I took my 15 year old daughter out for a treat. I don't recommend it. The atmosphere is pretty chill. I love that it's open late. But you will never hear me say \"Hey, you should go to D-Spot!\" This place has so much potential but it is such a disappointment.   The first time I ordered the white chocolate lava cake. Which is supposed to be a chocolate filled dome cake with a scoop of ice cream and white chocolate curls. Instead, it's a tiny little dessert shell, with a little bit of white chocolate in the middle, no chocolate curls and a PLATE FULL of ice cream. So much ice cream! It looks nothing like they present it in the menu and tastes nothing like they describe.  My daughter got the New York style cheesecake and while it looked pretty it was nothing to gush about either.  Last night we ordered Chicken Pesto Pizza, Cheese Pizza, Bacon Cheddar Poutine, Mango Dream, Man Go Wild and Cookies and Cream cake and Strawberry Shortcake to go. A $70 bill!  The pizza tasted like that Oetker Ristorante frozen pizza you get at the grocery store. The poutine had this nasty cheddar sauce on it, that had a terrible after taste, the mango drinks also had a weird bitter after taste. The cake was the worst though. I love sweets and cakes and I couldn't even finish mine. It was just sweet.Had more cake than cookie. The cookies were stale and the chocolate sauce was just brown, not chocolate.   If the food was really good, I wouldn't have even blinked at the cost. They price their food like there's a hard working chef in the kitchen, painstakingly preparing every dish. But the food tastes like they got it from the grocery store frozen section and made it look pretty on a plate.   Their prices are comparable to Kelsey's or Jack Astor's but their menu is comparable to Metro's Fresh to Go.   This was my second and last time ever setting foot in that restaurant.  Would I go back? If they got an actual kitchen and real food worth what they charge, probably. It's close by and as a nice vibe which is why they got that second star. But until they try a little harder in the kitchen and do a complete menu overhaul absolutely not.   The long and short of it is this place has so much potential...maybe they just need new management."}
{"text":"After all the buildup and excitement about checking out D-Spot, I was really disappointed in almost every way possible.   The service was unprofessional and untrained, with the exception of the bubbly chunky guy who seemed to be just a food runner / bus boy and a super thin girl washing tables. Which I had taken their names...they worked hard the entire time we were there.   Our waiter took our order and we never saw him again - oh wait yes, he was leaning over the cash register on his phone.  There was a waitress who popped in a couple times to drop off water, but never brought utensils or napkins until asked.   The items on the menu are over priced..$10 for a small sliver of cheesecake? Really!!  The pancakes with fruit...3 huge pancakes, tiny bit of fruit..with even smaller amount of drizzle.  They were good pancakes but very dry!! ( ordered the strawberry, and the chocolate)  The cappuccino was good, but served in a regular sized coffee cup?? 5 sips of cappuccino with 1/2 cup of froth!   The acoustics are terrible - the blender ran constantly mixed with a  16 - 24yr old crowd both were very noisy and created a loud echo so you couldn't be heard unless you shouted.  Suggest putting up glass barrier between seating and food prep area to help drown out blender which needs to move to the other side.   Spot lights r pointed downward directly in your eyes making it hard to see the people at your table.  Or change the name to D-Spotlight??  Decor is trendy-ish and liked that they seat you.  Menu very over-priced so not a place I'll be bring my co-workers to for Friday lunch. :-(  I hope the owner addresses some of the issues as it can be a great little dessert place after a movie which is right next door.   This didn't hit my D, E, or F Spot!"}
{"text":"It was surprising how busy this place was so I guess its really popular. We dropped by on a Friday afternoon. We had the strawberry shortcake which was delicious and the cookielicious (?) They had to substitute a brownie for the cookie as they had run out. It was all good as everything was delicious. I had some warm caffeinated drink that I cant remember the name of. A little pricey but a cute place to visit for when the sugar cravings hit."}
{"text":"D Spot is my GO TO dessert place! Can't even begin to count how many times I've came to D Spot and they have repeatedly given me the same amazing food and service. There's a 5-10 minute here and there depending on when you go but overall there's always seats. I've had plenty of the stuff on the menu. I definitely recommend Together Forever and Chilled Hot Chocolate for drinks. There waffles & ice cream are always perfect, solid portions to satisfy your sweet tooth. Hazelnut Cheesecake and Cookies and Cream Cake are a must have! I prefer D Spot over Demetres."}
{"text":"First time going here and wanted to try a new dessert place! Our server was nice however this place's fryer was not working that day (Sunday evening) and didn't find out until we ordered a fried appetizer. Mind you half the menu is fried. Wasn't too impressed with this place. Noticed the table next to us barely even touched their desserts and left. I guess they didn't like it either. The reason for the 2 stars is 1. Server was nice 2. The waffle was nice and dense. I wouldn't recommend this place. I'd rather spend my money at Cafe mirage or demetres!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite dessert spots! I personally have a sweet tooth, and whenever I crave something sweet and end up here, I leave satisfied.  I've tried a few items on their menu, however, my favourite dessert by far would be \"Your crepe at my brownie.\" It's SO good believe me.... but you def. won't be able to finish it on your own, because the portion is huge. It's a warm brownie inside, wrapped with a crepe, with milk, dark and white Belgian chocolate sauce drizzled on top. My favourite drink would be \"Man Go Wild,\" and yes it's a mango flavoured drink.  Service was good, but can improve. We got seated pretty quick, however our waiter could've checked up on us a bit more.  If you have a sweet tooth, and craving something good, def. check this place out!"}
{"text":"We will not come back to this place. Food are expensive, my latté doesn't look like latté. My latte is not presentable , it looks crap. I have experience in barista and i knw how café latté should look like."}
{"text":"I came back here with a friend. We ordered the mexican dream crepe, it was filled with lots of corn and other veggies. On the side it came with sour cream and a ceasar salad. The burritoo was really good even though I felt the crepe was a bit too soft.  My friend ordered the cheesy fries which she felt the cheese didn't taste so good.  Lastly we ordered the white chocolate lava cake. This was the best! It was so delicious the white chocolate lava wasn't running out but it was really spongey and white chocolatey and smelled really good too. Love how the ice cream with the white chocolate curls on the side balanced out the sweetness! I would come back here just for the white chocolate lava cake!!"}
{"text":"Really great food, perfect place to bring a date, or family gatherings. A little loud, but overall good experience"}
{"text":"Got violently ill after my first visit here tonight! My husband and I split a dinner crepe, which was mediocre, barely any dressing in the side salad so barely ate any. Then we each got desserts, which were massive. I got the hazelnut cheesecake with hazelnut ice cream. Cake was ok but I couldn't finish it. Ice cream was delish and creamy.   However, I got very very sick right after, so something was up with the dessert since my husband did not get sick. I've never been so sick like that before!   Also the service, although friendly, was quite slow. We ordered the dessert when we ordered the food, and we still had to wait at least 15-20 for them to clear plates and bring the dessert. There were plenty of staff and the place was only half full. Saw my server just standing around talking and drinking coffee with another employee while we waited for dessert.  Was very loud in there too, some family just letting their kid scream the whole time. And I have a toddler too so I get it but come on, get off your phone and try! Not the restaurant's fault I know"}
{"text":"Had the cheesecake here, wasn't all that.  Also had the cappuccino which was lukewarm and not all that great.  The menu is promising so will try other items but overall,  not sold on the two items I had.  Also service was very slow unfortunately."}
