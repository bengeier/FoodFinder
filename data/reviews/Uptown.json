{"text":"12 of us stopped in here before the Eric Church concert. They have a very large bar upstairs with an outdoor patio that faces the Console. Very nice place with a great wait staff. The alcohol selection is top notch with many selections.  What impressed me the most was the honesty we experienced. We came back for a nightcap after the concert. My wife left her purse on the patio. She only realized it was missing the next day. All her personal belongings including her credit cards, cash and phone were in that purse. I called there the next day and a young man who will remain nameless answered and told us her purse was there and in their safe. When we picked up the purse all her cash and credit cards were in tact. It's a good feeling to know their staff is a honest group."}
{"text":"This newly opened rooftop bar is atop the Blueline Grill and a perfect spot for a drink on a nice day. I went to a fundraising event they had for the grand opening which was great because we had the chance to sample many of the drinks and food from the menu. They have a nice mix of draft beers and I went with the Third Shift. The variety of speciality cocktails is quite impressive and I tried the blue Lemieux-very tasty and sweet. If you like seafood this is the place for you. They had mini crab cakes, lobster roll sliders, sushi, tuna, a seafood martini which was a mix of many types of seafood including lobster in a mini cup. I tried the pepperoni pizza which was very good as well as the popcorn chicken both of which I recommend.  The space is great with indoor and outdoor seating and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch...  Intro:  We took my parents here for Sunday Brunch this past weekend.  I had looked for a Sunday buffet through-out Pgh and could only find them at the Aviary & Zoo (Say WHAT?).  Yes- it's true.  Houlihans which was my 'go-to' for Sunday brunch had stopped serving and when I say The Blue Line Grille / Uptown FaceBook post on Sunday Brunch- I immediately inquired.  It was their very first one and aside from a couple 'growing pains- the grill guys not knowing they were supposed to be grilling pork belly (along with the NY Strip Steaks) and the menu listing Brisket (but the order never arrived in time- BUT the chef told me later that they were subbing Prime Rib, I think, to make up for it!)  There's no possible way I could give this place less than 5 stars.    Price: $20 per person, Mimosa's were $5, Bloody Mary's $8 then $5 refills  Food:  Starting with Breakfast types: White & Wheat bread, Croissants & Bagels, butter, cream cheese, smoked salmon (A FULL PLATE of it!).  Various pastries.  Potatoes- Hash brows & fried wedges, scrambled eggs and an omelet chef who would have cooked you any other types of eggs you would like, along with an Eggs Benedict chef who was prepared to send your eggs bene crave into high gear.  He had about 6 toppings at the ready to top your eggs with along with plenty of hollandaise sauce to smother it with.  They had a full pan of asparagus spears that were cooked perfectly.  I'm sure I'm missing something, but trust me- this would take care of your breakfast desires real quick.  Lunch Types: they had a grill going where you could get a NY Strip steak cooked to order, 2 skewers of pork belly, menu said shrimp but I didn't see any, and brisket (that was being replaced with Prime Rib?).    Salads:  House made antipasti salad, a macaroni salad and a rice type cold salad.  They had 2 bowls of field greens that contained plenty of spinach, 3 types of dressings, and plenty of salad add-ons.         Desert- Breakfast pastries, brownies, chocolate chip cookies, and mini deserts like cheesecakes and toasted almond things...    Oh, almost forgot... Gotta give a shout out to our server (Keith, I think).  He was very friendly, very helpful and made our visit all the more enjoyable...  We left there full for the day...  I would recommend this place to everyone...!"}
{"text":"I love brunch and this place delivers!! It's not the easiest to find. Enter the door to the left of Blue Line take the elevator at the end of the hallway to the top floor and you have arrived.   What I noticed right away is that there is a mimosa bar!! I don't like bloody Mary's so I'm always jelly of brunches that have all different types of options to accommodate Bloody Mary's. They do have said Bloody Mary bar but the mimosa bar was right up my ally. There are so many food options and I wanted to try them all. I love the omelet station and they have more options then what you would see at other places. They also have a nice salad and fruit area right next to the desserts. Our waiter was nice and accommodating.  Over all this was a great breakfast and let's not forget to mention that part of the proceeds from the bill went to the Ronald McDonald House."}
{"text":"After dinner at the Blue Line Grille we stopped upstairs to their rooftop bar called Uptown.  What a great place to relax and have a few cocktails. It has a large bar area inside and a great deck with nice decor and a terrific view! I will definitely come back here soon."}
