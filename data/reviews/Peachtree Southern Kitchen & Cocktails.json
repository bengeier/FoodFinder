{"text":"We stopped at Peachtree for a glass of wine and appetizers. The place was comfortable. Unfortunately though not only was the bartender cranky but he made us feel like we were a bother to him. Then we order sweet potato chips which were $9. The chips were burnt and was about one cup total. So overpriced and bad quality.  Couldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We were a party of three with a one year old for dinner last evening.  We had a difficult time choosing from the really appealing choices on the menu, and ended up ordering more than we could finish.  The menu is southern inspired, but don't expect a slab of ribs, this isn't Applebee's. We loved everything, including the delicious cocktails.  The ham sampler starter was yummy and quite generously portioned.  The white cheese pimento jar was delish.  The pork chop dinner was our favorite, although the bacon wrapped chicken breast with chestnut dressing and the cassoulet were also really good.  The staff was extremely accommodating, especially given our little mess-making one year old dinner companion, who really enjoyed the creamy mac cheese.  We were fairly regular customers of Old Whedon Grille, which was the previous restaurant in this location.   Peachtree is a huge improvement and is several culinary steps up from the former establishment, with the commensurate difference in prices.  Perhaps that is why some former reviewers have complained about the prices and portions. We found our dinner and experience to be well worth the price and are looking forward to being regular diners at Peachtree."}
{"text":"ATTENTION: NEW CHEF. DON'T BOTHER! As a Hudson resident, I've eaten at Peachtree plenty of times since moving here a few years ago. Friends told us about their famous fried chicken, and while I am the last person to order fried chicken, I must say it WAS incredible. We brought out of town friends and family to Peachtree for brunch, cocktails and dinner. We were very proud of this local gem. They had creative recipes, infused their own cocktails and rotated their menu seasonally. Well, no more. 

Last night's meal was an absolute disappointment. Out with another couple, we gushed about how we haven't been to Peachtree in quite a while and were ready for some of that famous fried chicken. The recipe is completely different. And while that may not seem like a big deal, the server's reaction told the story. I asked what prompted them to change their recipe, and she replied that they \"got a new chef\". I said, wasn't the previous chef one of the owners? She awkwardly acknowledged he was, but that he hasn't been there for about 8 months. She didn't care to ask us how anything else was. Clearly, she probably already knew.

Overall, this place has just gone down hill. Lifeless, unaware servers - never asking if we wanted to order more cocktails, and constantly having to ask for water refills.......Flavorless cocktails; Overall boring food; Bringing appetizers out only to be followed 4 minutes (not joking.....4 minutes) later by our meals...and the list goes on. I was embarrassed that I brought these people here.  

No wait on a beautiful Saturday night. Telling. Mark my words, this place will be closed in a year. I don't know, or care what went on with the management, but it is shame we lost a local favorite."}
{"text":"Wonderful addition to the Hudson restaurant scene. Great southern style food---fried chicken is not too be missed. Friendly and helpful staff that always seem to be there when you need them.  Relaxing patio great on warm nights."}
{"text":"This place has it's great points and it's goof ups but their chicken and waffle was great. Their burgers was wonderful and did I forget to mention their scrimp and grits are good with a capital G. :) 
 My issue with them is that they changed their mac and cheese into something horrific and they had a wonderful super great dish called piggy fries that they destroyed. I hope they fix (I brought it to the managers attention) those two dishes but the rest are worth every penny."}
{"text":"Northerners trying to cook southern food. For the price I expected it to be more than it was. I would go again but probably try something different or maybe just cocktails."}
{"text":"After seeing the not-so-great reviews, my friend and I decided we were feeling adventurous and would give it a try anyhow. I can only guess that they've made some adjustments in the last couple of months because both the food and the service were fantastic.  We shared a number of bites (catfish tots), firsts (fried green tomatoes, southern ham sampler, shrimp and grits), my friend ordered the soft shell crab sandwich, and I had the corn souffle skillet.  Everything was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked (including the shrimp), and the portions were appropriate for the price and richness of the different dishes.  I think I could live on their catfish tots and shrimp and grits.  The only item that approached \"bland\" was the souffle, but a.) it's a souffle, it's supposed to be light with a more delicate flavor, and b.) it was alongside some stronger flavors.

Only one small snag with the meal (overtoasted top sandwich bun) and it was taken care of immediately and apologetically.  No harm, no foul.  Our server was Chrissy (I hope that's right), and she was wonderful - very friendly and helpful. 

Yes, Peachtree is on the expensive side, but it's very much in line with the other finer-dining restaurants that are within walking distance of the square in Hudson and First and Main.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and the staff is very pleasant. I had the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad; my friend had the chicken salad sandwich with roasted beet salad. None of what we had was very good and we would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I've strolled past Peachtree many times and once they had a chalkboard outside announcing their daily special of macaroni and cheese with kale and breadcrumbs. I am not a mac and cheese person but that day it sounded delicious and the three days following, I could not stop thinking about that mac and cheese. 

I finally made it to Peachtree last night, not for the mac and cheese-that craving has passed, but for the five dollar build-your-own burgers on Monday nights.

It was a Monday night so there were not a ton of guests there but more than I expected to see. The restaurant is in a historic home on Main Street in Hudson. They have fixed it up really nicely. The decor is simple but elegant.   There also seems to be quite a lot of seating for being in a complicated space. 

Our server was Alex. He was also the host and the bartender. Staff was a bit thin being Monday night but we got all of the kindness, attention, and friendliness we could ask for and not a bit more than we wanted. Alex was fantastic. He made sure that our drinks stayed topped off and we were updated on the status of our food. He took a few minutes to have a conversation when we had questions even though he had pleanty of other tasks at hand.

The build-a-burger deal is pretty cool. Your burger starts at 5.00. There are extra charges for some items.  I got a veggie burger instead of beef and it was a dollar more. My husband got the sirloin burger with onions, mushrooms, garlic aioli, feta cheese, and ketchup. I got the veggie burger with onions, mushrooms, garlic aioli, and sriracha.  We also got an order of fries to split. 

I was really impressed. After reading yelp reviews I didn't have the highest expectations for Peachtree but gosh--the fries were the picture of perfection and my burger was just fantastic. The fries were cut very thin and cooked just perfectly. The most incredible balance of perfect and soft, sprinkled with flakey sea salt and rosemary. My husband kept trying to offer me some sauce to dip it in and I told him not to dip perfection. 

My burger was also impressive. It was a black bean base with corn and brown rice (I think?). Sometimes black bean burgers end up crumbly or the outside gets hard and sticks in your teeth. This was perfect. Soft and not crumbly or gooey. The other issue with black bean burgers is that they tend to be seasoned (not a bad thing, just a thing). They often taste like something to make them taste less bean-y. These had no overwhelming flavor. Just a nice, delicious canvas. The bun was toasted just enough to keep it from getting soggy, but not enough to make it crunchy. The garlic aioli and sriracha were wonderful together.  They came on the side so that I could apply the amount I wanted. The onions were crispy. There weren't a lot of mushrooms.  I actually forgot that I had ordered them until I found one near the end of my burger but it was so delicious that I didn't care. 

Peachtree was a great experience.  A beautiful restaurant with great service and excellent food. I will be back and not just for the Monday night burger deal."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, drinks amazing! Ate every last morsel on my plate.  Really cool building and architecture"}
{"text":"Peachtree was pretty disappointing.  We went there expecting Southern food, as advertised, but it turned out to be another one of those \"foodie\" places where the chef is trying to impress with appearance, trendiness, and high prices instead of genuinely good food.  There wasn't a real down home Southern dish to be had:  no bone-in fried chicken, no catfish, no ribs, no grits, and not much seasoning on anything.  We were looking for a place to please the palates of those who love real Southern food.  Cornbread was pretty good, but no refills after one small piece.  A very limited dessert menu -- and the South is famous for its desserts.  The service was good, atmosphere nice but with weird music (Rockabilly?) and the check for two of us was over $100."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best, I had the blackened chicken served with sweet zucchini and smidgen of red beans & rice @ $19. My first choice was Etoufee (out of that) or Shrimp & Grits (out of shrimp) and we were the first seating @ the 4:00 dinner on a Sunday. Bloody Mary's were tasty but rather expensive @$9. Server was tending bar as well as waiting tables, seemed to have a chip on his shoulder & another server aka bartender was downright rude. Can't give much of a recommendation, probably won't return!"}
{"text":"Specialty cocktails had virtually no alcohol in them. The mac and cheese was bland. Chicken and waffles soggy.

Stay away from this place. It has gone downhill in a hurry."}
{"text":"I really wanted to try this place. I walked in and saw plenty of free seating but the waitress looked me up and Down and said \"wellll..... we only take reservations\" My friend and I were in casual attire for a girls night out. She was a loyal customer and said she never had this happen before. Needless to say we will be finding a better southern restaurant.

I'm sorry our pockets didn't look to be lined with enough gold for your snobby restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night! Tiny portions, very expensive. Guy pouring water accidentally poured water in my vodka soda. Served a half bowl of soup without any bread or crackers, had to ask for them. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Complete dinner fail. 

- online menu is not up to date. Despite my afternoon call to confirm that the menu posted on their website was current, this was not the case. As a vegetarian, my options here are limited to begin with. The vegetarian dish on the actual menu did not appeal to me. 

- waitstaff not well versed on the menu.

- again- very few vegetarian options. Meat and meat juices lurking in most dishes, even those that one could reasonably expect to be vegetarian. They should take a cue from other area restaurants and label truly vegetarian items as such: with an * or v.

-sent fried green tomatoes back- way too greasy. Breading to tomato ratio was out of whack. Fried spinach & oil featured more prominently than said tomatoes.

- in summary: fail"}
{"text":"This is one of my friends and my very favorite restaurants for Sunday brunch.  The Pecan French Toast is absolutely outstanding...it just melts in your mouth!  Nice, casual & comfortable dining restaurant.  Friendly and accommodating staff.   Since it's on the main street in Hudson, there are plenty of shops in which to browse to walk off your breakfast, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place was actually horrible... food wise and customer service. I got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was literally half cooked (if that). When I told the waitress, she had the manager take the food to the back and returned with no food and stated that \"the chef said it was cook\". She then stated she would take 1/2 of my meal off but would not give me my food back or a different meal. I was baffled by the disgusting customer service. I refuse to return and have literally convinced people to save their money. The meal my husband received was mediocre at best. There are a ton of better restaurants in Hudson"}
{"text":"Went to brunch today and thought the good was very mediocre. Had grits and shrimp. The shrimp were baby shrimp over mushy grits. Very tasteless nothing served with the dish.  I would not go back. Very expensive for what you get. The menu is very small."}
{"text":"Had a nice experience. Staff was very friendly and very competent. My husband got the short rib ( pot roast) and he loved it - it looked great!  I ordered the ribs and sadly I cannot recommend them - they were not very tender and I had a difficult time getting the meat off the bone. For a $23.00 entree I really expected better. Even though some of the entrees are overpriced ( I know- it's Hudson) we will go back - I'll just get the pot roast next time."}
{"text":"Good food and atmosphere.  Corn bread as a starter is a nice touch.  Kids mac and cheese was good.   Pork spring roll app was a plus."}
{"text":"Outstanding food in the heart of Hudson.  Chicken and waffles at Sunday  brunch with a bloody mary.  Great service too."}
{"text":"I am Not one to typically write reviews but I was extremely disappointed in my dining experience here.
I went in with a reservation on Mother's Day. I was promptly seated.
It took 15 minutes for a server to come and greet us. 
This was just a sign of everything to come. We only ordered entrees and a small salad....it took approximately 1 hour and 35 minutes for our food to arrive. Our waitress came by every 30 minutes or so apologize for the wait with no explanation of why everything was taking so long. 
The food was fine, however, we subbed out sides with one entree and they charged a fee for this (but when we asked they didn't inform us there's an upcharge). 
All in all, I'm beyond disappointed with staff and service. This $25 chicken meal is not worth a 2 hour wait. A simple explanation as to why they were so slow or management coming and apologizing may have made the experience better. 
Treating someone to a Mother's Day dinner was supposed to be a gift, and I left embarrassed."}
{"text":"We held a private event here and couldn't be more pleased with the outcome. The food, atmosphere and service were wonderful. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The food itself was pretty good (I ordered French toast and my husband ordered biscuits and gravy). Unfortunately, it took over 30 to get our food and no one really checked in with us to let us know the food is coming or why it was taking so long. The restaurant was not at all busy- only about 3 other tables when we ordered, then more came in. Once we did get our food, my husband's plate was cold. There were bites that were room temperature, but others that tasted like they were straight from the refrigerator. Since we needed to be somewhere at a specific time, we didn't ask for a new plate of food since we didn't know how long that would take. They did give us a complimentary serving of peach cobbler. Overall the flavor was there, but I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"We recently gave Peace Tree another try, this time for lunch, and were happy to see some positive changes. I'd been to the bar a few times between the first review and this update, and was pleased with the service and drinks, though less so with the appetizers. This most recent visit, however, my family had a very pleasant experience. Our server was friendly and helpful, the food was great, and the manager popped by to check in on us at the end of our meal. I had the bone-in fried chicken, which was added to the menu about six months after they opened. The meat was juicy and full of flavor from the brine (perhaps a little too sweet, though) with a good crisp fry. The dish was served with sweet potato waffles, which were overpowering when combined with the maple syrup. One waffle was enough, and I would order the sauce on side next time around. We also had calamari with banana peppers, which was excellent."}
{"text":"Great lunch beginning with well-done corncakes and sweet tea and ending with excellent pulled chicken Caesar and Cobb salads.  Service on the quaint patio was superb.  Enough to bring home for a second helping at dinner.

We've also been for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed the food - creative but not too \"out there\"."}
{"text":"Strange service, good food.  
Reserved a table through opentable.com and asked for seating in the bar area. Arrived and did not get seated in the bar area. Ok, no big deal, bar area is small.  Tried to order appetizers before ordering our dinner and was told it is easier on the kitchen if we order it all at once. I don't usually experience that, but ok, no big deal, order it all at once. It comes out at record speed in quick succession, and plates are cleared before my fork hits the surface. The food was good, not great. 
The dining room on the main floor is too cramped with tables. I had to keep my elbows close to my body at all times. I really want this place to succeed and maybe it will, but it needs some tweeking. The tables offer no coasters or anything to set your silverware on besides the bare table itself. Try resting your silver on the bread plate and you get both snapped up in record speed. The cocktail I had was lovely and would have had more but felt rushed. Will probably not go back."}
{"text":"Terrible!  We have been going to Peachtree since it opened.  It was always great food and good atmosphere, But something has changed.  The food was bland and well, just bland. The deviled egg app used to be fabulous and now tastes like prepacked Sysco food.  And the clientele is now loud drunks that camp out all evening and ruin a nice place.  Small restaurants should decide if they are a bar or a foodie place.  Peachtree is now a bad mix of both.  I will no longer recommend it.  Too bad."}
{"text":"We were looking at the menu at Peachtree the other day when another couple told us it was great, but knowing it had bad reviews.  Having eaten there tonight, we know the problem -- the customers.  Apparently they confuse Cajun cooking with Southern cooking.  Just as most confuse Spanish cooking with Mexican cooking.  This is not a Cajun restaurant.  It is more akin to southern low country cooking.  And we were delighted.  We have a home in Savannah.  We eat in Savannah, and this was as good as Savannah has to offer.

We did an assortment of appetizers and sides.  The fried green tomatoes with bacon jam -- awesome.  The sweet potatoes -- excellent.  The collards -- great.  The shrimp and cheesy grits -- super (maybe a little salty).  We'll definitely be going back -- because its like home."}
{"text":"Here visiting from FL. We were lucky. We came in on a Thursday when they have their Tasty Thursday 3 course menu. I enjoyed the bourbons paired with each course. The pumpkin pie is to die for. Brandon, the bartender, is awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting to go here for brunch for ever! Unfortunately, they only serve it on Sundays. So I had to wait a few months, but I am happy to report that I have finally gone. I made a reservation via OpenTable, and it was super easy. I was really excited to go here because I was a huge fan of the Old Wheedon Grill, which was the restaurant in it's place before. So I was anxious to see what filled its shoes. And I was not disappointed. While it did take a good while to get our food (40 minutes from the time we ordered), and I am 99% sure our waiter had a massive hangover, the food was still delicious. I had the chicken and waffle with a side of hashbrowns (which were really potato slices). The chicken was actually chicken breasts, which I was a fan of because I have chicken thighs and wings used before, which is so stupid because it's covered in syrup ... so it's hard to eat. But these guys got it right. It was mouthwatering chicken, the syrup wasn't too sweet and the waffles were fluffy and light (my mouth is watering just thinking about it). And the potatoes were just the right amount of crispy. I can't wait to go back and try its dinner menu."}
{"text":"OK -- Fairly pricey for a rather limited and not very inspired southern cooking menu. I will say that the sriracha calamari was a very good appetizer. Cocktails are small. 

OK if you want to spend $25 + on a dinner of fried chicken with a waffle, and eat in an old building on historic Hudson's Main St. --- I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here though."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have come here for both dinner and brunch and found both meals to be very tasty! The restaurant has a small plantation feel with hardwood floors and an iron rod spiral staircase.

My family and I ended up here on the Family Style Fried Chicken night (Wednesdays) and it turned out to be what both my Dad and I ordered. I am sure glad we did because the fried chicken here is out of this world delicious! The pieces of chicken are large and the in house breading is to die for. Each order comes with hush puppies and a large side. We opted for the cheesy grits and the collard greens. The cheesy grits were so so good! The whole meal is what dreams are made of!

My Dad and I also came here for Easter brunch and again were blown away by the flavor and made from scratch quality of the food. I opted for the ham benedict while he ordered the biscuits and gravy. You can tell the biscuits are made from scratch and are so good. 

The service here both times has been great and I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"We were here for Mardi Gras we ordered the calamari appetizer. For $11 it was very skimpy and not enough for 2 people to share. My wife ordered the crab cakes which were very salty and not good. I ordered the jambalaya, it was not a true jambalaya but edible. We have tried this place twice both times we were disappointed."}
{"text":"When my stepmom invited me to meet her for lunch at Peachtree I was excited. We both dig Southern food.  I am so sad to write this but this place fell incredibly short.  Instead of leaving the review as that blanket statement I will explain why:

Honey sriacha butter that came with corn muffins was stone cold and not spreadable 

Fried green tomatoes were hard and the breading didn't adhere to them

Pulled Pork sandwich had slices of American cheese (as in Kraft singles).  Come on, where is the gorgeous cheddar that should be on there?  I didn't think there was any real flavor to it, and the pork tasted like it had been reheated quite a few times.

Chili had hardly any meat in it and was more like a bowl of tomato paste.  No spice, no flavor, bland.  

Music sounded like it came from a boom box in the kitchen.  I heard Journey and Bob Seger during lunch.  Where is the music connection to Southern food?  

There was NO ONE else in the restaurant at noon on a Wednesday.  Such a great concept but flawed execution.  Bummer.  I won't go back.  But something tells me they won't be in business much longer."}
{"text":"One expects any Mother's Day brunch to be busy. However, we found the service to be lacking at Peachtree. No water offered or salt and pepper on the table. The wait staff acted more like bar tenders than waiters...pretty informal. The floor under several tables was messy with dropped food from previous patrons. The eggs Benedict with biscuits was not hot. The wait staff offered my husband a coffee refill, but did not offer to refill mine. The food was good, but the service was disappointing."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch yesterday. It was okay, took awhile for a server to get to us and took 30 minutes for our food to arrive (after being told a few times \"your food is coming right out\"). I had the french toast and bacon. It was nothing special (I think the french toast I make is better). The bacon was just your standard thin, not crispy enough bacon. I think they could make a good change to thick cut applewood bacon for something special. My husband enjoyed his chicken and waffles. 

They do not NOT have cappuccinos or lattes, which I also think would make brunch more special. Oh and mimosas should be added to the menu.

I wouldn't go back, other places to try."}
{"text":"I love having dinner and drinks at Peachtree. The cornbread muffins are delicious and the food is excellent. I could eat the cornbread polenta every day and never tire of it.   Portions are not huge, but that doesn't bother me. The drinks are great and priced competitively priced for Hudson. It's not just the food that keeps me coming back, it's the atmosphere and the service. We try to take our new guests to dinner at the Peachtree when they come to town."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I can't believe I waited so long to try it.

Chicken and waffles - amazing! I was part of a party of 4 and we all loved every dish.  The happy hour prices are a steal and the portions are generous."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in Hudson!!  Love this place!  Southern cooking with dome flair!  One of my favs in Hudson"}
{"text":"Stop what you're doing and head on over to the Peachtree! Great cocktails, many bourbon based and outstanding food! Crawfish etoufee, crab & pimento dip and much, much more deliciousness. The owner, David, is a wonderful, kind man, which is what we needed after a long, tough day. The entire staff is great and the bartender is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"There hasn't been this much failure for a Southern experiment in the North since Pickett decided to slaughter those slave-owning imbeciles from the Confederacy on Cemetery Ridge."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday, service was mediocre.  Figured we'd get southern food (shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles.) grits were horrible, im pretty sure they were instant grits, and probably soaked in plain water.  The chicken and waffles were nothing spectacular, chicken was kind of soggy. They need to work on the breading better.  I really wanted to like this place, the menu looks good, but i feel no reason to ever go back."}
{"text":"Cute place in Hudson with good food.  I had the fried chicken appetizer and a bowl of clam chowder.  Followed by the classic burger (I think that was the name) and southern coleslaw instead of fries.  All was delicious.  My lovely had a veg- burger and pecan pie.  She approved."}
{"text":"I was close to a 5 star rating but its a little pricey for what you get.  This is one of those \"presentation and flavor\" places.  Great for a foodie tv show.

I really enjoy how Southern the food is and how tasty.  Great change of pace is why i gave it 4 stars.  We will be back."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and tried Peachtree tonight.  Everything was great!  We had the brisket nacho appetizer- YUM, fried chicken, ribs, mac and cheese, and greens, all wonderful!  Service was great too!  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What a great place.  We took in dinner at Peachtree after seeing Phantom of the Opera in downtown Cleveland. We wanted to try something different. Wow!  We were so surprised at how great the food was along with the service.  The nachos were our appetizer of choice and oh my, we were not disappointed.  We also had the chicken and waffles which we highly recommend.  It was out first visit but won't be the last."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but I just couldn't. We came for New Year's Eve and there was only one other couple on the main floor when we arrived...on NYE! It was shocking. I felt the fried green tomatoes were bland. My husband said the breading on his wings had a hard time staying on and I would agree in terms of my fried green tomatoes. We both thought the breading was bland but he enjoyed the sauces with the wings. My pulled pork mac and cheese was tasty and flavorful. My husband's fried chicken was plentiful but again the breading didn't hold onto the chicken. The honey added a nice sweetness. The chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked. The collard greens were well cooked and flavorful but could have used a touch of acidity. The mashed potatoes, like other things, we're bland. They were completely lacking salt. .  Towards the end of my meal the songs played in the restaurant were 'N Sync back to back. If I'm paying $100+ for a meal I expect different music. Service was good but I highly doubt we will return."}
{"text":"Fabulous corn bread and She crab bisque.  The patio is a great setting for a family get together or Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"They have updated the menu since they originally opened and it is awesome. Real southern food.  Chicken and waffles,  buttermilk chicken, ribs,  etc.  Great drinks. Good atmosphere. It is our favorite place in Hudson since the menu change."}
{"text":"Food was great! However. We had a party of 23 with a menu that was already decided. They ran out of crab cakes! Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were so so excited that a new restaurant option was going into Hudson, and when we heard it was going to be Southern Cooking we could hardly wait for it to open.  

And then it did.  And we went.  And we were soooooo disappointed.  

There wasn't much traditional southern food on the menu.  It was hard to pick what to order because it just wasn't what we had in mind when we had our hearts set on \"traditional\" southern food.  What bummed us out even more were the prices.  So expensive!  Why can't someone in Hudson open a decent restaurant that is a mid-price range instead of trying to be One Red Door/Rosewood Grill/Downtown 140 wannabes?  This area is desperate for good food at a lower price point.  We thought a good southern cooking place was going to deliver on this. We were let down.   

Then the food came.  It was OK.  I wasn't all \"wow! Now I get it\" over the food.

Service was OK.  But if you insist on being a high end restaurant then your service should match.  

Hudson is known for its great restaurants.  You can't just open something up, charge a lot, and expect to be successful.

If you are the owner/manager reading this, please reconsider your menu and price point.  It's a great idea in theory and something completely different, which Hudson deparately needs.  I promise you, if you do this, your place will be packed.  There's and amazing New Orleans style restaurant in Denver called Lucille's. They are only open for breakfast and lunch.  People will wait for hours with a line stretching down the street waiting to get in because the grits, biscuits and gravy, egg mash ups, beignets, fresh squeezed OJ etc are OFF the HOOK!  The restaurant is nothing too fancy inside and it isn't excessively expensive to go.  But it is top on our list of places to eat at whenever we visit Denver.  Point is, it can be done."}
{"text":"Great, intimate space with bar on one side of ornate spiral stair and dining room on the other. Greeter and wait staff are just lovely - warm and genuine. I love getting beer recommendations and the light beer was perfect. Table bread is a corn muffin with spicy sirracha butter but make sure to order the savory beignets - hot, bacony goodness."}
{"text":"We went on fried chicken Wednesday where the deal is a salad, 3 pieces of scratch made fried chicken, hush puppies, and a large side for $22.  And if more than one in your group orders it they serve it family style.  Make sure you plan in a bit of extra time if you order the fried chicken since they make it from scratch and only make it when you order it, it does take a little longer than the normal turnaround time.  And I totally recommend the cheesy grits, they were the best I've had in a while."}
{"text":"A very nice atmosphere to enjoy good southern food !! Enjoyed the bar which is very tastefully decorated with the southern accent and style !! Very nice people !! Wines and the food selections were excellent !! Courtney and Hailey were very nice and made sure we had a great time !! Eric was very personable and made sure everything was to our expectations. Will most definitely recommend this place anytime !! 

Thx

{"text":"Absolutely the BEST fried chicken I have ever had.   The server recommended it, and it was fantastic. Crunchy spice filled breading and juicy wonderfully flavorful chicken. They take reservations and our server Lauren was wonderful."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. Have never had a bad meal here. Highly recommend the beignets as an appetizer and the eggplant for your main course. Servers are friendly but not very attentive, management should definitely focus some efforts on hiring and training on customer service but the food makes up for any lack of that."}
{"text":"Had a truly awful, overpriced meal. Chicken tender on salad included literally a deep fried piece of pure gristle. Service was slow and uninspired.This is a place to avoid, and shouldn't stick around long at the rate it is going."}
{"text":"Great Southern menu. I lived in the south for almost 10 years, and Peach Tree serves the best chicken and waffles I've ever had. I love that the menu rotates seasonally, as well. Everything tastes fresh and flavorful.

You can also get quite a change of scenery at the same restaurant. There's a quaint, dog-friendly patio, a classy indoor dining area and bar with a historic-building feel, an upstairs with a fireplace and a really cool basement with modern lighting and exposed brick. Despite all the seating, I'd recommend making a reservation. 

The only slight negative is that the cocktails always seem somewhat off. The flavor profiles on the menu are excellent, but they are always a tad strong on one or two ingredient. But they pour very generously on wine :)"}
{"text":"Seriously out of fried chicken?????!!!!!  I brought 8 people tonight because I love the flavor profile.  2 hours to get served .. Res at 7.45 .. Food at 9.45 and cold.  Taste was good but 2 hours and no fried chicken.  A real shame because the chef absolutely knows how to cook.  Hard to come back even though I like it.

Not a good experience.. Until they took off the main course ... The owner understands some nights don't work and he made up for it!!!   Smart guy .. We will be back and again he can really cook!  Jacob an awesome server by the way!!!

Back again and so far the service and food are superb"}
{"text":"Had a nice meal at Peachtree, excellent service and good food.
Started with chicken cracklings, the honey hot sauce combo was very good. 
Had the pork tenderloin for dinner, it was well prepared but missing a sauce or something to elevate it to the next level. I really like the peach/ pork combo but it fell a little short.
The amazing redemption was the pecan pie. I am a dessert person and this definitely exceeded my expectations. 
Nice variety of cocktail and wine options, would definitely return again."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for brunch today with a couple of friends and were very underwhelmed. We ordered the beignets and sausage gravy and biscuits. I don't know what those little round pieces of bread that they brought to our table were, but they were NOT beignets. Far too dense, the wrong shape, cold, barely any powdered sugar, and made out of possibly sourdough? Not good. The sausage gravy and biscuits was pretty bland. I don't think it was made with sausage - maybe cut up pork tenderloin instead? it was missing the flavor that normally comes with sausage gravy - more pepper and sage were needed here. The eggs were bland (I ended up asking for salt and pepper because they do not keep them on the table) and the breakfast potatoes were just okay.

We had really high hopes for this place but, sadly, will not return to give it another shot (especially for brunch)."}
{"text":"Review of Peachtree Southern Kitchen, Hudson
An attentive staff could not redeem this establishments uninspiring, overpriced menu or it's feeble attempt to replicate a \"Southern Cuisine\".
We endured $9 watery baked macaroni with microscopic bits of Tasso ham, $6 bowls of a \"gumbo special\" which although containing plenty of vegetables, was bland & unseasoned, and $15 \"Southern\" Cobb Salad soaked in a bland oil of some sort, (did I say bland again)? There was also a small $24 short beef rib dinner that our dining partner said was OK.
These items were actually some of the less expensive on the menu. I don't mind paying for quality, but this was a far cry from quality and an indistinguishable facsimile of \"Southern Cuisine\".
If you want the real deal and you not worried about paying for it try Russo's on State Rd."}
{"text":"admittedly I was thinking a bit more about Cajun than Southern when I walked in. I quickly recalibrated and set expectations for a more subdued food.
 Even with this, I have to say the foods were very bland. The chicken soup was very uninspiring. My hopes were high for the bacon wrapped chicken but the bacon didnt appear to be precooked in anyway before wrapping the chicken which may have been why it melded into it and was rather limp?

I was happy to see the bar stayed in tact as this was always a favorite part of the old place."}
{"text":"Was here about a week ago and I thought the food was great! My mind is blown on why there are so many bad reviews. Waiter was very knowledgable of bourbon and I thought the ambiance upstairs was great. I had the coulotte steak with the BBQ steak sauce and I thought it was excellent. Presentation was great too! I've only been here once, but I think this is 1000xs better than Old Whedon or however the hell you spell it. Will def be going back!"}
{"text":"my wife and I went here for the first time yesterday. Peachtree is a pretty cool place. 

As soon as we walked in, my immediate reaction was \"well, this place is loud.\" But then the person seating us so that we could either sit on the ground floor, in the \"cellar,\" or upstairs - awesome!  We picked the cellar, which had great ambiance, and was quieter; the stone walls and low light were really nice.

Our server, Lori, was amazing. Pleasant, conversational, and attentive.

My wife really liked her meal - I'd say mine was between 3 and 4 stars. I had the chicken and waffles, and while the flavor was outstanding, everything could've been cooked for a little bit longer.  For the record, everything was totally done & safe, but just lacked the level of golden brown crispness the other photos showed. 

I certainly plan on making a second trip.

Went back for a second visit. I'd previously said that my first meal was a bit underdone - same story this time around, but it was both my wife's meal and my own. I had the crawfish etouffee, which is described as \"Butter garlic sautéed crawfish served over rice with a spicy Cajun red sauce\". If you look at photos of this dish, it maybe looks like a stew at its most liquidy...what I had here was a soup. A soup with undercooked rice. And the spicy sauce? Nope. There was zero heat to the dish. My wife's grits were also undercooked. 

I still love the atmosphere here, and the service is fine. But for the price, the food should be better."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Very happy that we came back. Sad that we couldn't try the crawfish sloppy joe, but the pulled pork mac and cheese was delightful! $5 burgers are huge and delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, great drinks. This is a fantastic addition to Hudson's already eclectic restaurant scene, and a very unique one at that. My favorites are the catfish, southern fried chicken, chicken and waffles, catfish tots, and the smoked wings (amazing!). Haven't had a bad dish yet. Drinks are phenomenal as well! Try their blueberry vodka or a southern mule. Decent draft list as well. Glad they're in town and once again occupying that historic building in the oldest part of Hudson."}
{"text":"Myself and 5 friends went to lunch, we had Emily as our server, we met the owner he came to our table and asked us how everyone was doing and how the food was. We were very pleased with the special cocktail we had. It was a titos blueberry homemade lemonade, it was delicious.
I would rate this higher than a 5 star but yelp won't allow that, the place is cute and very homely.. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"At first skeptical of the this restaurant because of some pretty terrible reviews.

The location is great, the building looks cute, and it's a dining room with some personality, so you'd figure the food and service should match.

Now, for me on my first visit it did match.  Our server was fantastic, never went hungry or thirsty, and she was amazing with coming back as we needed time to research the menu.

Ahh, researching the menu...it's big.  14 starters, 13 entrees and 7 burgers.  A bit much to take in.  Kinda like cable TV, having 57 channels and nothing's on.  There's 20 possible dinner options and none jumped out at us.

The bar's mixed drinks were good, very strong.  So good we doubled down on our order.

We went with the server recommendation of the Catfish Tots - House Pickled Peppers / Remoulade.  They were awesome.  Really loved them.  Great suggestion.

Next up were the Carolina Crab Cakes - Red Beans and Rice / Remoulade, and the Chicken & Waffles - Sweet Potato Waffles / Chicken Tenders / Ohio Maple Syrup.  Both were very good dishes.

Only odd thing we noticed was the chef delivering dishes to the table, not in uniform, but in an Indians t-shirt."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time at Peachtree. We don't venture out to Hudson often but we are glad we did for this dinner. We went on a recent Friday night and although busy it wasn't packed. We had reservations for our group of 6 & a couple arrived 15mins early and they were promptly seated. They have a nice cocktail menu & decent beer list. Everyone seemed pleased with their cocktails. Our server was wonderful; attentive, funny, knowledgeable on the menu & was able to make recommendations when asked. 
My husband & I ordered the fried green tomatoes & the pimento cheese to start. The tomatoes were good, thick cut & fresh. I would have liked a mustard type sauce for dipping but the addition of spinach & peanuts on top was tasty & new to me. The pimento cheese was spicy, the house made BBQ chips were mind blowing. I prefer my pimento cheese to be creamer but all in all I'd certainly order it again! 
I got the fried chicken as the entree. 3 perfectly cooked bone in  (leg, thigh & breast) the breading was crispy & not greasy at all. I Loved the onion mashed potatoes! Seasoned just right. My husband ordered the special, country fried steak, & the small taste he allowed me to have was very good. He was pleased as well. No one in our group was particularly awed by the desserts however. All in all we were very pleased with our dinner & we will be back again."}
{"text":"I am writing this review solely on atmosphere and friendliness of staff as I unfortunately didn't get to try the food because I got pulled away for an emergency work call. Maybe the food is absolutely amazing and something to write home about, but I will not be returning to this establishment. Here's why:

The staff. Lifeless, no personality, and unattentive. For being a place with a southern menu, there was absolutely no southern charm, or any charm for that matter. The host didn't say two words to me when I walked in and instead blank stared at me until I spoke. I sat myself at the at the bar, and watched the bartender look right at me in the eyes and walk in the other direction to pour coffee. Great, pour coffee but at least say hello for petes sake! The manager came out and gave me a menu. \"Can I get you something\"

That is my biggest pet peeve greeting when sitting at the bar, obviously you CAN get me something that's why I'm here, but I just sat down, and haven't even opened the menu yet. Tip for the manager and staff: Have some personality, say \"hey welcome! What brings you in? Here's our drink menu And this is the food menu here. Give a minute to look it over\".

Anyways, I looked it over decided on a glass of wine. Food menu was a book which included all menus in one. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Kind of strange but whatever. I wanted to order the eggs Benedict as I was here during brunch time, but as mentioned above, my time was cut short with a work call, I instead had a glass of wine, and headed out.

The atmosphere: zero atmosphere. Was strangely quiet with a boom box playing classic rock quietly in the corner. The place was bright and open and had no charm or character. I was disappointed, maybe a more southern style feel, louder music and I'd switch from the ac/dc Classic rock to maybe country or jazz or blues or anything more southern feeling to go with the supposedly apparent theme of the place. 

Overall thoughts: maybe the food is so incredible but the atmosphere and staff just didn't live up to the hype or expectations I had and I won't be returning to try the menu. 

Not recommended. Two stars for the adorable name."}
{"text":"Expensive with little portions. Food was not good. Very disappointed. They are never busy...I can see why."}
{"text":"Food took forever to get to us, they forgot an order in our party altogether. The food tasted odd like old oil was used. They didn't staff enough help for a Sunday"}
{"text":"Culinary excellence at it's best ! Peachtree was officially opened just three days when we arrived to dine, they did not advertise the opening but will do a grand opening, just down the line, I am sure.
  Peachtree is a very welcome arrival to the City of Hudson, 
Ohio, for sure. The appetizer we choose were the chicken frits with some hot sauce, wonderfully done and I may add a Southern tradition. Our main course was the light breaded and seasoned Southern fried pork chops, I died and went too Heaven, in addition the side dishes were also excellent, very few eateries compare in Hudson. We will be back ! The service was great but, not overdone. The wonderfully light and beautiful décor was a very welcome item with great appeal.
  PS; They have a Sunday Brunch from 10 AM until 3 PM ! Bring your appetite !

Impressed,
T. Dean"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times, most recently with out of town friends.  Best Southern style food I've eaten North of the Mason Dixon line.  The fried chicken is amazing and the drink menu is pretty good too.  Good overall selection of appetizers and entrees.  Service has always been great. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Over cooked greasy burger, stale fries, unseasoned mashed potatoes, chewy fried chicken. Wait staff was nice but there was 4 servers for every customer. Won't be returning until it's under new management."}
{"text":"Great ideas around food choices; however, the food doesn't have the seasoning that would allow anyone to call it southern. Work on that and the place would be perfect!"}
{"text":"The short of it: new management and wait staff. Don't go. The staff, while nice, is green. Coffee was served cold because they didn't know how to turn on the warmer. The kitchen must also been new staff as well, and a bit inexperienced. We went for the brunch they now serve on Saturday's and got the sausage gravy over biscuits. The home fries that accompanied the plate were wildly over seasoned. I could enjoy the extra flavor, but their season was mixed heavily with salt and made them almost inedible. The biscuits didn't live up to my memory of past meals here. I have no proof of it, but I question how much was prepackaged compare to house made. 
Until they get their legs underneath them, wait it out. Staff mentioned they will likely be changing the name soon. That ought to be a good indicator of the level of change PeachTree has gone through."}
{"text":"Went here with a group from work for lunch and we all loved it. The food was great, the cocktails were creative and the decor was very cool (loved the spiral staircase in the middle and the artsy photos of Hudson on the walls). White tablecloth setting; Southern food, but with polish. If you are coming here looking for greasy (yet delicious) fried chicken and traditional Southern food, you are probably not going to like this. See some of the other reviews as reference. But if you are coming for a classier dining experience, creative twists on a few Southern classics and a price point that is certainly not cheap, but probably no more expensive than nearby establishments (e.g., One Red Door), you may just dig it. We did."}
{"text":"Very small portions for too much money. No side dishes come with the sandwiches. We were so excited about Southern comfort food locally, but they tried to make this too fancy and failed in the process. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love this place! Super friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere, and unique, delicious food options not readily available anywhere else. Great cocktails and appetizers, lots of delicious, homey entrees. The chicken and sweet potato waffle plate is unique and yummy!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after finding it on Yelp, not from the area and was just here for a night. LOVED the food. Absolutely amazing. My boyfriend ordered chicken and waffles which is a favorite of his. I tried some and they're easily the best I've had. I ordered she crab soup, which was also delicious and we split some \"piggy fries\" which are like a southern version of poutine. Thick cut steak fries with tender bbq pulled pork and a homemade cheese sauce. I was bummed we didn't get any of the cornbread I read they bring to the table, but that might be because we sat at the bar. The beer selection could use a little help. Seemed like they had a random selection of California and Michigan beers which doesn't really fit with the southern theme of the restaurant. I tried a tequila sunset, one of their specialty cocktails. Good, but overly sweet for a tequila cocktail. Reasons I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5: it seems a little over priced for the area, but again I'm not a local. I think the chicken and waffles was $20 and it's just two small waffles and a few pieces of breaded chicken. The soup was $7 for a cup and the piggy fries were $7 or $8 for a small portion. That with a $9 cocktail and I felt like I was paying downtown Cleveland prices. Finally a note to the management, you need a more concealed server station. The current one is at the end of the bar and it doesn't look good when you have 5 staff members leaning on the bar chatting about their private lives. Clearly the bartender didn't care for this either as he kept asking them to please go do something. He was the only bartender and the bar was full. As a former server, the management needs to find them some side work to help out. 

Overall fantastic and will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered Catfish tots...just a little under cooked.  The smoked chicken was delicious.  The greens were too sweet. 
Very nice atmosphere. Our waitress was new she did an awesome job."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. We were sat with two three tables in the basement the two other tables were served immediately we sat there for 45 mins with no acknowledgment what so ever. Keep in mind I has a baby and wearing a bright neon green hoodie. I called the manager and he said we needed to flag down a waiter. I'm sorry it's not my job to make sure my order is taken that's why waitresses and waiters are hired I'm brand new to this town and that gave me a really bad impression. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Went in for a drink at 9:30 the cold reception coming in a half fucking hour before close -- they just stared at us and said they were closing. Sorry thought you were like in business. Thumbs down"}
{"text":"Good service and nice locale. Food was really inconsistent. Desserts we're excellent but rest was more bland. Bisque and greens were good but others like chicken was only ok. Mashed potAtoes bland. Good drink menu. 
Portions were small in some cases. Catfish bites am example of that but white pimento in a jar great bargain."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with a fitting Feng shui that enveloped the southern theme and the extremely high quality of food. Every time I go there I have a great meal that begins with an interesting dish that is great leading to a wonderful entrée that takes my senses on a tantalizing hayride. Besides a few small issues this is one of my favorite restaurants that I make the hike to Hudson for."}
{"text":"Had a disappointing dinner here last night.  The atmosphere is nice, but the value just isn't there for the price. The service was mediocre; my wife had to wait 10 min for her first glass of wine, the waiter spilled sauce from the appetizer on the table and failed to clean it up.  As for the food, up and down.  The catfish tots appetizer was delicious but scant on portions.  The shrimp and grits lacked zest.  The Potato Sage Gnocchi was fantastic.  Overall I would not recommend with so many other excellent choices nearby."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. The decor is French country chic and is really quite inviting! The service was great as well in this very intimate atmosphere. 

The dinner was great as well. I had the catfish over a veggie quinoa salad and a Rosemary sauce. This was absolutely delicious! It was also beat to have cornbread at the beginning of the meal. The wine selection here is amazing! Overall, it's great but the only thing keeping it from receiving a 5 star rating is due to the fact that it's a tad expensive for what you are getting. Overall great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Love this place...we come here all the time for lunch. Their cocktails are great and they have a good selection of wine and beer. In addition, the service is always nice. They have cornbread to start (delicious!) and each meal is so different that anything you could get nearby. The fried green tomatoes and mac and cheese are good to start.... Pulled pork and catfish are great entrees."}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I wanted to love Peachtree so badly. The location is great, the name is adorable and southern cuisine in general typically rules. But, its just OK. 

Ambience: The interior is very simple. Not a lot of color and ambience, and the focal point is the cute spiral staircase that goes between floors. Also, for an 85+ degree day, it was really hot inside. I know it's a Southern restaurant, but... crank on that air conditioning! 

Food: I really enjoyed the chicken and waffles. The chicken had a nice tendered breading to it and the portion was very generous. It had a nice presentation and made for excellent leftovers. I also ordered a side of grits, but they had zero taste to them, which gives me all the sad faces in the world, because I loveee grits. We asked for cheese and salt/pepper (they don't leave any on the tables), and that helped a tad.

Drinks: For a place that has cocktails in its name, I had super high expectations. I have never sent a cocktail back in my entire life and sent my Bloody Mary back due to the overly strong pepper. My second drink, Aviation, was marginally better, but no one at the table really loved it, so it maybe only had a few sips out of it, despite having pretty presentation. Le sigh. My mother enjoyed her raspberry martini, though.

Service: Our server was very nice and attentive and was more than accommodating when we asked for salt and pepper or a different drink. She had a lovely personality and was very welcoming.

Overall, the experience wasn't super awesome, but it wasn't the worst. Considering our bill was $115+ for 3 people, not sure if this would necessarily be my first stop in Hudson again."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday brunch with some friends. The hostess and our waitress are both really nice and helpful. We all really liked our meals and also the atmosphere in general. 
I am a huge egg Benedict person so naturally that's my go to. They replaced English muffin with some kind of southern biscuit. It tasted good, just personally not my style. I was disappointed when my poached eggs didn't have runny yolk...but I wasn't going to send it back. The home made fries are more like potato slices. But it is the perfect amount of crispness! I also ordered a chocolate pretzel martini and it was really delicious and well made."}
{"text":"Some of the complaints in the poor reviews for this place seem to be based on small portion sizes and high prices.  After enjoying a GREAT meal here, I think those poor reviews are very unfair.  The portion sizes are appropriate and reasonable.  My wife and I shared an appetizer (chicken liver pate with crostini and house-made pickles) we each had an entree (sweet pea gnocchi with garden vegetables ; fried snapper with crawfish grits and green tomato relish) and shared a dessert (pecan pie) and we were both very full.  The waiter recommended a side of the braised collards with bacon- really great suggestion, I could have eaten a whole plate of them.  The prices are higher than most, but they are completely fair based on the quality of the service and food, which were excellent.  I will be back, for sure.  The bar selection is excellent too.  If you go, try one of the old fashioned southern cocktails.  My wife tried a sloe gin fizz which was beautifully made."}
{"text":"Went with my wife and a friend for lunch.  It was OK.  The food ideas were good, but everything was just OK.  It all needed a little more spice, a little more flavor, it just wasn't anything to get excited about.  The service was excellent, but this is not a place for a quick bite, it was slow paced."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious I already know what I'm going to order next!!! My friends and I had ordered the chicken and waffles! My husband ordered the sausage gravy and biscuits.  We also ordered a side of sausage gravy because we wanted to dip our chicken and waffles into something.  The service was fast even though they were busy.  

The food was so delicious that even though our portion was big enough to have some left overs, we ended up eating it all! This left us with overly full bellies and uncomfortable pants... so definitely wear your stretchy pants if you come here!!

Everything on their menu looks so delicious that I am already planning another trip back!  So if you're craving some southern homestyle cooking, you need to try this gem out!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this restaurant that's located in my hometown.  Someone told me it would be a perfect place for a date night and so I planned a date night with my beau! I was looking forward to this meal for days. 

We started off with some drinks. I ordered Bell's Two Hearted and my boyfriend got a Corona. The waitress brought the drinks and I instantly noticed that my beer looked lighter than it should've and I knew she gave me the wrong beer. I brought it up to the waitress politely and she insisted it was the correct beer and said something along the lines like \"I can ask the bartender\" (the classic game that some workers play of pointing fingers to other workers), and alas, I was correct. She gave me Bell's Oberon. I don't mind Oberon but that's not what I ordered. I really didn't care about the incident but our waitress shouldn't have tried to argue. 

We moved onto food. We ordered the Piggy Fries (House Cut Fries / Cheese Sauce / House BBQ / Pulled Pork) and it was amazing. We were starving and this combination of unhealthy goodness hit the spot. 

It was hard to order entrees because everything looked great so it took us some time to make up our minds. I ordered Peachtree's Signature Buttermilk Fried Chicken (Country Green Beans / Onion Mashed Potatoes) and John ordered the Carolina Crab Cakes (Black-eyed Pea Salsa / Rice / Citrus Aioli). 

My fried chicken was in my top three that I have ever had! The breading had hints of honey and it created a perfect flavor. I didn't care much for the green beans and mashed potatoes but the chicken stole the show. 

John's crab cakes were good but not the best. It was a bit bland and the rice didn't help it either. The rice was plain and could've been dressed up a bit more. I just expected better flavors since the price is up there and well, southern food usually screams flavor. I'd skip the crab cakes, especially if you have high expectations.

Overall, I'm not craving to go back. I had a great experience trying the chicken but nothing is pulling me to go back to the restaurant.  The price isn't very reflective of the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience, fantastic food! That's Peachtree in a nutshell! 

First, the restaurant is in downtown Hudson and offers all the charm inside, as the street does outside. It's nice and upscale, yet still maintains a casual feel. There is a three story winding staircase right in the middle that adds to the overall atmosphere.

The food is phenomenal! True southern cooking! Chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, and a burger that has a piece of fried chicken on top! How can you go wrong??

I was going to leave a 4 star review because we went there on Sunday in the afternoon and app they had was a very abbreviated \"Sunday Brunch\" menu, and the rest was off limits, however, our waitress went above and beyond and spoke with the chef and he agreed to make us what we wanted, which was excellent service. They absolutely EARNED a 5 star review.

If you are craving good home made southern style cooking, in a fun, upscale atmosphere, this restaurant is for you!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere reminded me of some of the restaurants I've dined at in Charleston SC. A+ for the feel. Music was great. They played a lot of doo-wop and it fit perfectly. The mint juleps were awesome. Maybe a little too good. Food overall was great. They ran out of fried green tomatoes so we went with the beef brisket nachos instead. The shrimp and grits were fantastic so I'm not sure why it was getting some negative reviews. Maybe they just had a bad night? Regardless will definitely go back. The outdoor patio is an added plus."}
{"text":"Seriously, does the \"chef\" actually taste anything that comes out of this kitchen? My wife and I chose to order there dishes from Peachtree at the Taste of Hudson, as I was anxious to try this restaurant. 

The mac and cheese was totally tasteless! No flavor of butter, cheese, or even basic seasoning like pepper. I didn't realize that it was even possible to make pulled pork so flavorless, with the meat in the sliders being cold and mushy in texture as well as devoid of flavor. Continuing this trend, the chicken wings were also totally lacking in seasoning and flavor of any kind. Very sorry that we chose to spend our money at this vendor. Needless to say, we will not be venturing into this restaurant. An opportunity squandered by Peachtree Southern Kitchen."}
{"text":"A very small place. .. with very very very small and expensive items. Our bacon wrapped pork tenderloin took forever to arrive and was 4 half dollar sized pieces..one without bacon. The waitress was fine..but the overpriced small entrées is not worth it. Keep driving."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere (18th century tavern) with fantastic food! Like most Hudson restaurants, however, not cheap. But if you're looking for southern food delivered in a sophisticated presentation you'll love Peachtree. Also, if you're a bourbon enthusiast, go for the Thursday bourbon dinner: 3 courses paired with 3 bourbons/bourbon cocktails for $25!"}
{"text":"The building is pretty neat and that was it. I got the seafood special which was Ahi Tuna rice and vegetables (zucchini) . The vegetables were cold and the tuna was bland. Sorry if I'm paying 28 bucks for a meal I expect it to have more flavor and for it to be warm. Wife got pulled pork, very small sandwich for the price. She did say it was good. Waiter provided good service."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've actually sat down and read all of the reviews, while clearly my experience was more favorable  compared to others I can see why the majority of locals would be disappointed. This place is expensive but let's not forget where you're dinning at; it's Hudson- EVERYTHING in Hudson is over priced!!! I felt Peachtrees prices just came with the territory. I ordered their White Pimento Cheese ; for this being something out of my comfort zone I have to say it was fresh & the homemade chips were delicious by themselves. But paired together was also smile worthy & the price vs/ portion was dead on. 
    As for not being the stereotypical Southern quinine everyone was craving, well that's one of the reasons I like this place. If you're craving \"traditional\" clog your arteries, gravy looks like puke southern cooking then go to Mike's Place in Kent or even Bob Evans. But you shouldn't put this place down because it has class and the chef incorporates their own (healthier) twist on food. I'll admit, my meal wasn't the orgasmic experience I had anticipated but it wasn't horrible either. My husband ordered the caramelized scallops & said they are ten times better than Virtues (the Akron General Hosp. restaurant)! He also enjoyed their shrimp & grits. 
  I found the skillet mac with bacon jelly to be kind of bland ( I got mine without the kale which is prob why) but once you stirred in the bacon jelly it was awesome! It even tasted great when I used my left over chips to scoop it up, the smokiness just added to it. 
  However, I have to disagree with the comments about the service. The hostess was so polite and jolly. Our actual server, Stiles; was perfectly attentive and had a good sense of humor- as I responded with \"How about a foot rub\" when asked if we needed anything else. And the entire staff behind the bar all wished us a good evening as we left. The atmosphere itself is stunning (wish I couldn't seen upstairs), clean, sophisticated and intimate. You can't go wrong with the original woodwork of the bar. 
   As for the music, it's always going to be personal choice vs. the owners play list. When it comes to music, I'm bi-polar; I can rock out to Eminem one minute & Janis Joplin the next...so the acoustic versions of the Beatles & Eric Clapton was much appreciated (at least by me)."}
{"text":"We have driven passed Peachtree Southern Kitchen and often thought about stopping to eat. I'm glad we finally did!  Everything from the drinks to the main course was amazing. Even our server, Jacob, was awesome!  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place. I'm all about the different food influences on the menu: Charleston, New Orleans, etc. But the food left me wanting. Service was fine; we made reservations on OpenTable and were seated promptly, on Valentines Day. The drink menu was well bodied. She had a beer, I had an Old Fashioned. It was just strong, but just OK. We got the Fried Green Tomatoes which were passable. The Bacon Jam was the best part. She had the Shrimp and Grits. The shrimp had a chili-like BBQ sauce. The grits needed more cheese. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffles and syrup were good. The chicken needed more time as it felt almost raw (it wasn't) and lacked the crunch I expect. 

It wasn't bad; maybe I built it up too much. I wouldn't rule out coming back. But out the door with a 20% tip was a whopping $96 for 2 entrees, and appetizer and 3 adult beverages. Ouch. Next time I want Southern food, I'll venture down to SOHO in W.25th..."}
{"text":"My friends and I met up here for lunch on a Monday. It wasn't crowded and the staff was very nice. I had shrimp and grits. I'm not a fan of anything but butter, salt and pepper on grits. There was some red sauce barbecue like sauce that I didn't like on the grits, but the shrimp tasted great. However, me and one other girl had to ask for salt and pepper. I felt like they didn't add any and I had to keep adding salt."}
{"text":"Peach Tree Southern Kitchen is tucked away in the historic main street of Hudson...just off of First and Main. My wife and I received a gift certificate and ended up with a free afternoon - kids free - to enjoy a meal out. 

The atmosphere is pretty plain - nothing that necessarily stands out, but clean and quaint.

Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. She was not overbearing but made sure that everything was to our liking. 

The menu is magic if, like me, you like southern cuisine. I actually said to my wife, \"I want the Etoufee, the chicken and waffles, the fried chicken, and the shrimp and grits.\" Not too much to ask for!!

My wife ordered the soup special - vegetable leek. It was a great soup, creamy, we'll seasoned, and unique.

I chose to start with the pulled pork spring rolls. Spring rolls are hard to get right as the oil temp needs to be perfect so that the dough crisps up instead of absorbing the oil and becoming a log of grease. The fry was okay, but the filling was too sparse for my liking.

I chose the Cajun Etoufee. It was good. Really good. The seafood and pork were succulent and the dish was well seasoned. If I had one minor complaint it would be that I could have used a larger helping of rice to offset the liquid.

My wife chose the Pulled Pork Mac and Cheese. The pork was well cooked, and nicely sauced. The mac and cheese was equally good. My favorite note was the bacon jam which had a great smokey sweetness to cut through the richness of the rest of the dish.

The tap handles were a bit above standard. Not too out of the box, but more than your basic American Lagers. 

All in all, I will be back. A great experience with excellent food and service."}
{"text":"The drinks were good, but a little high priced- typical expectation for Hudson though. The service wasn't desirable as the waitress forgot to put in part of our appetizer order and never offered us dinner. We had split our bill with another couple and it was also itemized incorrectly. The place was not busy for a Saturday night, so no excuse in that realm for the mistakes or lack of service offered. The appetizers were mostly delicious minus the undercooked steak piggy fries and the awful chili on the nachos."}
{"text":"$9 for the pimento grilled cheese and fries felt a little overpriced, but the taste was good and the waitstaff was very friendly and competent."}
{"text":"I have never been so blown away by a restaurant. If I could give 10 stars I would! I woke up hungry for some brunch on Sunday morning. I randomly found Peachtree on Yelp. I just got back from Nashville so Southern food was definitely on my mind. I arrived and was seated immediately in an absolute gorgeous dining area with leather padded chairs, cloth table cloths, and cloth napkins. Out waitress was prompt and incredibly friendly. We ordered biscuits and gravy, the omelette, and chicken and waffles. The portions were perfect and the presentation was out of this world. Absolutely better than anything we had in Nashville the weekend before. I'll post pictures as well. We ate every last bite and gave our compliments to the chef. The chef kindly allowed us to sample a new dessert he is considering for the menu. They are small chocolate cheesecakes. I'm not a big chocolate eater but this tasted just like hot chocolate but with a subtle kick. It was cayenne pepper! Unbelievable! We had the best meal ever for under $35. I can't wait to go back and try other menu items. You'll love it too!!!"}
{"text":"Passing thru Hudson and came across this place. Great food, excellent service!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here with my parents, who are sometimes hard to please when it comes to finding something they are comfortable eating.  The menu is large enough where one should be able to find something they like.  The chicken and sweet potato waffles were great.  There are daily specials, which we took advantage of including a family style dinner that included sides and salads.  

Our server was fantastic, very attentive and kind.  This would be a great place for happy hour and even family events.  Definitely will be returning!"}
