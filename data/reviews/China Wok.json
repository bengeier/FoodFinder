{"text":"This is my go to place for Chinese delivery. Never actually been to the store though, most of the food is pretty standard, however the dumplings are fantastic, they're all I order now."}
{"text":"Chicken is always cooked properly. Lunch prices are unbelievably reasonable. I highly recommend this place for a fast lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here one time and that was to many. My teriyaki chicken looked as if it was another animal..egg rolls were covered in sweet and sour sauce from being delivered and when I called to complain about the disgusting food and the way it arrived they did nothing to make it right and the 9 year old girl working in there was even more ridiculous. I will never go there again ."}
{"text":"The food is ok for Madison Chinese food (I say this because I do not think Madison has very good Chinese food overall).  It is cheap, we got three entrées and an order of crab rangoons for under $25."}
{"text":"We have had take-out quite a few times and every time the food has been excellent. What more do we need to say! Wayne & Millie Martin, Alamogordo, New Mexico"}
{"text":"So after a long day at work, I was feeling a little peckish and truly felt like some Chinese food. So, I came here to \"Yelp\" to read a few reviews and decided on this place not too far from my flat.  

The food wasn't bad at all.  The \"House Special\" fried rice was really very good as well as the Salt and Garlic wings.  I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. The egg fu young was horrible. The edges were so tough I couldn't get my plastic fork through it. After eating a few bites I found a black hair sticking out of it. And it was the size of a McDonald's hamburger.

The fried rice was okay. It had lots of white meat chicken and ALOT of scrambled eggs but it lacked flavor."}
{"text":"This buffet is by far the WORST buffet I've ever been to. All the food was old. There was only 3 pieces of battered fish and one shimp on the food pan and they were hard as stone.  The fried rice was only a little and old and hard.  There was barely any food on the pans...like 10% of food on each pan. We got there about 2:30pm and stayed there for 30 min. waiting to see if they would bring any new food out...but nope. They would not bring any food out until dinner time which is 4pm. We couldn't stay and wait one more hour until they serve dinner. We came hungry and we left hungry. And there was no other customers but us. What a waste of money!!! The worst part is, i got sick for 3 days after. Thatd what eating old food will do to you!. So beware of eating old food. I would never recommend this place to anyone. Worst place ever!!!"}
{"text":"My go to delivery Chinese spot..from that category you gotta know what to expect but the Wok definitely steps it up over any other delivery place that I know of in the area."}
{"text":"The food is good only problem is the place needs to be cleaned. I was eating and here comes a cockroach on the table, lost my appetite after that since I had to kill it."}
{"text":"Awful service order egg foo yong got some kinda shrimp slop.We ordered two orders of dumplings got one.Hair in my egg drop soup.They did not want to give us credit or money back when we called.I think it is disrespectful not to honor costumers. I think this restaurant is run by cheaply and cant admit when they are wrong.Not coming back here .I suggest you stay far away from this nasty place..."}
{"text":"First time here and I order beef and broccoli. It was pretty good it wasn't terrible like I had in the past. The inside is not the nice but everything is or seems pretty clean. I gave this place three stars because when I called the person was kinda rude and when I went inside the cashier was rude. Other then that it's not that bad of a place to eat just not the greatest customer service."}
{"text":"We went for dine-in and wasn't really what we expected.  Food was served in to go boxes but ended up being pretty good.  We will be going back, just not for dine-in."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Isn't the cheapest price but for what's it's worth I'll continue to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"The food is good for inexpensive Chinese food.  The service when we ordered online was awesome - they noticed we wrote a note asking for something to be made vegetarian, and they took the extra step of calling us to make sure we knew that one part of our order did have meat in it.  It was very thorough and thoughtful!  Their delivery is speedy.  Food is satisfying."}
{"text":"I ordered the sesame chicken and it was good. Had a nice breading, but could use some more sauce(might have been since I got to-go). Fried rice also good and the egg roll had a nice crisp to it. Restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"The great thing about China Wok is it is exactly what you'd expect. It's your decent, standard Americanized Chinese fare. I've never had a bad experience; it's always the same. This place is close by me, so delivery is always super fast. Although the food is generally nothing special, the fried dumplings hold an especially, soft, doughy spot in my heart."}
{"text":"The staff here is always friendly and they have the best Wor Won Ton soup that I can find in Las Vegas imho"}
{"text":"this might possibly be the worst food I have EVER eaten.  No flavor, the vegetables were almost mushy, and the \"crispy\" chicken was squishy. The cost was not worth the product delivered.  I could not even eat most he food.  Too bad I did take out, I would have left it in their trash can of I had tried to eat it there."}
{"text":"I think I am always gonna find myself coming back to this place. It has the best crab Rangoon and the Seseme Chicken is unforgetable. There should be more places like this and if the building space was more attractive or bigger, I think it would be really successful unlike other resteraunts. Also, the delivery usually takes half an hour so I order 15 minutes earlier *hint hint*"}
{"text":"so, chinese food... i never care for it, but every once in a while, mr. bekee gets a hankerin', so i go along.

their vegetable moo shu was excellent. a great mix of fresh, crispy (when necessary) vegetables and egg, delivered with four pancakes (not flour tortillas, like some places try to pull), and yummy plum sauce. the vegetable spring roll was also a success, though a little over-greasy.

my dining companion had a three-meat and garlic sauce dish, which he said was delicious with dumplings and a pork egg roll. all were very tasty.

the best part was that the delivery took under 15 minutes! and we're over 2 miles away, as the car drives. i presume they'll become part of our lazy weekend agenda."}
{"text":"Tasty tasty tasty, and speedy delivery. I have regularly had them arrive early with my order. Try the honey garlic chicken, it's fantastic. It only costs a little more to get the entrees with noodles instead of rice, which I infinitely prefer. The Hawaiian shrimp fried rice is also really good. If you're looking for something lighter, their healthy menu, while it lacks the yummy sauces which are the tempting side of Chinese food,  is always freshly prepared, the vegetables at just the right texture."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for delivery.  Results were good; I ordered Szechuan chicken. The meat was very well cooked and tasted great with plenty of veggies. It was spicy, and that's the way I like it!

Girlfriend ordered the Kung pao, was also spicy and good. 

Overall, Would order again!"}
{"text":"I'm saddened to give this a poor review. One stars is a huge overshot but zero was not possible....

We veered off from Yummy Yummy to try something more \"traditional\"....what a MISTAKE! We love Yummy Yummy, next time we'll stick with what we know....

We ordered Won Ton Soup, Chow Fun (not so fun), General Tso's Chicken and Cashew Chicken....in a nutshell, there was something wrong with every dish except for the soup, which, contrary to what I'm posting, was delicious.

The Chow Fun was very overdone, so much so that the noodles were breaking up and the vegetables in it were turning from their bright, friendly colors to a dim, sad mess....I do agree that the pork was cooked good, but it had a fishy undertone that tells me it was cooked after some fish or shrimp dish which carried over the taste into the noodles.

Don't get me started on the General Tso's Chicken (soggy, drenched in sauce)....Cashew Chicken (also fishy) and even those things so simple, like deep frying the Crab Rangoon and Egg Rolls were a huge MISS! The oil (which they said was changed daily, I highly doubt, even the best restaurants with the highest table turns don't change it but once a week!)....the oil was changed daily but the food told me otherwise: dark brown in color....no better than Panda Express if you ask me.

We really put our best foot forward with ordering from China Wok. As I said, we normally order from Yummy Yummy....and have never been disappointed. Why we took a journey to an unfamiliar restaurant, I'll never know....but this insures that we are devoted to them and would sadly, never go back to China Wok unless they got their act together!"}
{"text":"I had the seafood delight today for carry-out.   Portions were very large.   However, overall the food was not very good.  The steamed rice had a unknown flavor.   I don't know what spice they added but it was unpleasant to the palate.  The seafood delight had two pieces of lobster that was way overcooked.   It was extremely chewy as were the shrimp.   Even though the menu states 'jumbo shrimp', they were not.  The crab meat was not real crab, although the menu states 'crab meat'.   It was the typical substitute crab concoction.  I did not find a scallop, though one sliver might have been a piece of a scallop.  Probably 50% of the dish was broccoli.  Way too much.   And there was little or no flavor to the entire dish.   Not a good experience.   There are much better Chinese restaurants in the area.  Would not recommend and would not order again from this place."}
{"text":"Probably won't eat here again, ordered fried rice which tasted extremely bland, dry, and under seasoned. Truly awful. Ordered the general Tao chicken and pan fried noodles and it tasted equally dry and bland. They forgot my drink. Gross."}
{"text":"I love this little place. Delivery is always fast and usually earlier than the time given. The food is really good. I've been eating here for years and while the menu has never really changed, it is a large menu of great food.  I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the female owner who I've seen multiple times over the years yelling at her delivery boys and staff in front of customers; totally unprofessional. I haven't seen her there recently and I'm okay with that."}
{"text":"My hubby and I order from China Wok when we are just too wiped out from work to worry about dinner.  Vegan stuff for me, meat stuff for him.  Everything is always pretty much fine.  They do have a pretty long delivery time, but they let you know while your on the phone what eta to expect.  The delivery person is always nice. No complaints."}
{"text":"They always give us free soda while we wait. The counter persons are very nice. We always have taken the food to go Bcz it's after grabbing groceries. They have something very close to real duck sauce if you know what's up."}
{"text":"My husband & I happened to be running errands around the Phoenix area and got hungry, so we found this place... At first glance, it didn't look clean and nobody greeted us or smiled as we walked in, but it had gotten late and we didn't want to drive around any longer. 

The good: Our meals were prepared quickly, it was cheap, and the portions were large. The staff was nice and personable once we ordered. The bad: Well..... The food was yucky and bland, and tasted like it was sitting all day (and I am not picky about Chinese food). The rice had hard pieces in it, the noodles tasted strange, and the tofu dish just had small pieces of a few veggies with tiny slices of tofu that seemed like it hadn't even been cooked. The egg roll had a strange stuffing and it was burnt black. There were 2 fried ick type \"veggies\" included and they were so hard and burnt crisp that I couldn't even tell what they were. They were too hard to even break apart.

When I threw away our plates, I had to use a napkin to push open the trash can because the lid was filthy. There was also a fish tank with extremely cloudy water and huge fish that were crowded in and didn't have much room at all to move. Sad for those fish. I wonder if someone should call the Arizona Game & Fish Dept.? I wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"OK I ate here and the next day my Head was killing me. I'm not sure if it was the geese, the sodium or the combination of both but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I ordered food here today and was highly disappointed. The chow mein had no pork as ordered and the cashew chicken had no chicken. With all the options Las Vegas has to offer, I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I love china wok, been going there for a long time, always fresh! I love any dish I get there!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at China Wok for years and years. I've always been blown away with how delicious and fresh everything tastes, as well as how quick the delivery is. I've never been disappointed with their food, even after having eaten their food at least 100 times.

I usually try to broaden out from my favorite menu items, but I find myself gravitating back to them. The lettuce wraps are VERY underrated and you get enough in one order to eat as a meal for one or two people. You get a big container filled with whole lettuce leaves and a giant bowl containing a mix of grilled meat, crunchy veggies, and little noodles. It's actually quite sweet and that pairs well with the taste and freshness of the lettuce leaves.

Broccoli beef is always just the right amount of sweet, salty, and savory. It's one of my all-time stand-bys.

The honey-garlic chicken is flat-out amazing - my girlfriend orders it every single time we go. It's a tangy, sweet, and ooey-gooey dish.

But the best two things on their menu, by far, are the crab wontons and steamed dumplings. You owe it to yourself to try these, as well as the lettuce wraps.

Overall, it's one of my favorite places to eat, anywhere.  And since I don't live in Scottsdale currently (coming back soon), it saddens me to see the locals where I live think the mediocre Chinese food they eat is any good. When I come for visits, I now bring my friends to China Wok with me and they finally understand how good Chinese food can be."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. I literally just got home from there with my small order of chicken chow mein and egg roll packaged in a paper bag. I reach for the bag as I'm exiting my car and the bottom falls out bc it was soaked with the juices from the food. In turn my legs are burnt from the noodles and all over the floor. I call to explain the situation and the lady tells me I can pay for another order and to bring the old order back. I explain that I'd be happy to bring the bag with the bottom out, but the food is all over the ground and most went on my legs which is now In the garbage. She was hostile in turn and put the phone down for a few minutes while she spoke to her \"boss\" while I could hear them arguing the whole time. I've always sent people to this place, never complained about anything, the least they could do is replace my food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go to China Wok every time we visit Scottsdale. It's a 30 minute drive from where we stay but it's definitely worth it. The crab angels are AMAZING and they make Honey Garlic Chicken which I have never seen at another restaurant. I've tried quite a few of the menu items and I've never been disappointed. They have average pricing and the restaurant itself is nothing special but it's all about the food."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The food is always hot and fresh and the delivery is fast. Our favorite is the combination fried rice. Tonight they delivered even though it was right at closing time. We really appreciate the excellent service!"}
{"text":"We order from the China Wok on a regular basis and the service, food and owners are great."}
{"text":"Not sure why I keep deciding to come back here. Rice is rock hard and has no flavor, along with most of the other food on the half-empty buffet trays. $10.50 for a plate of stale food and a drink that they forget to refill? No thanks."}
{"text":"The worst experience I've ever had. I went out to lunch with a group of coworkers. We intended to go to Defalco's, but due to a long line we decided to go across the street. Wrong mistake. We walked in and placed our order. As I went to fill up my drink, we received our food. When I sat down to eat, I noticed there was something in my cup. I used my fork to fish it out, and fished out a cricket. I immediately asked for a refund, and the lady insisted to provide a refund for my drink. I demanded a full refund and returned their food. At this point the lady showed the manager the cup and the manager apologized and provided a full refund. She offered to remake my order and give me a new drink to which I declined. My coworkers realized that I was returning my food and stated they didn't want to know what happened. I respected their wishes and let them finish their food. They did state that their food was good, especially the orange chicken. Neither one of them was happy with me after I told them why I didn't start my meal."}
{"text":"The china wok buffet is the best Chinese buffet I've ever been too! I only give it a 4 instead of a 5 because if i find something better(very unlikely) i won't be able to rate it as such. This buffet has everything you could want from Chinese food. It has a delicious array of chicken's, pork, and seafood. My personal fav's are the Tso's, peppered chicken, crab cheese bake, deep fried shrimp, and the baked salmon. Their crab Rangoon, egg rolls, and soup are fair. Finally their desert. Unlike most Chinese buffets I've been to this one buckets of ice cream. You serve yourself but you get a decent assortment of Mint Chocolate chip, strawberry, butter pecan, and birthday cake. If your ever in the mood to over indulge on food at a really good price. I definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"Worst chinese ever.  Hot and spic chicken smelled like ketchup sauce, not spice at all.  Mostly onion and what chicken there was, was rubbery and disgusting.  My wife's beef and brocoli was mostly brocoli with grizzly and fatty pieces of beef.  We will not order there again.  I ended up eat hotdogs and throwing it away."}
{"text":"It's REALLY hard to find good Chinese food around the South Scottsdale or Arcadia area. This place is the best of everything I've tried around here.

I would recommend their Spicy House Chicken. It's lightly battered chicken in a spicy honey sauce and just hits the spot with you're craving Chinese takeout. Their egg rolls are pretty good along with their sweet and sour sauce too. My boyfriend recently had the egg drop soup which he said was really tasty.

They're super fast with takeout too - I called during the week recently and it was ready in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"I moved from Cleveland Hts to Westlake two years ago, and have finally found a good Chinese restaurant. On top of the food that was perfectly prepared and seasoned, my small order had plenty of soy, hot mustard, and duck sauce in the bag without having to ask. plus they deliver."}
{"text":"More than once I've found myself driving fifteen minutes out of my way just to eat here.  Their food is consistently delicious and generously portioned.  The place is clean (usually the opposite is true for good Chinese places) and they have a large fish take, as every respectable Asian establishment should.  Friendly family owned place and the people there speak English (??!!?),  Brilliant.

I would highly recommend the soup here.  Mmmm, hot and sour..

And it's cheap!  For about $20 you can get a big portion of whatever main dish, rice, fried wontons, an eggroll (the combo), an order of crab rangoon (they call them crab angels and they are AMAZING), and a large thingy of soup.  You can get your food as a combo, rice bowl, or a la carte.

And it's quick!  And conveniently located amongst the strip clubs and pawn shops of south Scottsdale.

Did I mention they deliver... for free?"}
{"text":"Delivery is fast to Mt Washington. Food is always hot. The price is right for what I order."}
{"text":"YYEEESSSS!!!!! Recently moved to Pittsburgh and we were craving Chinese food. We found our new place! We got delivery and the food was still steaming when it got to our building. Portions were bigger than expected and it tasted great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely pathetic. I get that this place has cheaper prices, but the ingredients are trash. The chicken isn't even real, its processed and slimy and is like biting through rubber. The rice tastes like they just poured it out of the friggin bag and there was no seasoning AT ALL on anything that touched a wok. 

For $16 i could have walked to the giant eagle next door, made better Chinese food and saved four dollars. 

Bland color and bland taste. If you like eating plastic then order food here and shove a chopstick in your eye so the pain distracts you from this god awful food."}
{"text":"Been coming here for about six or seven years now for the pork lo mein. Love the orange chicken. Once a month I pick up dinner for my family here. They have never let me down. Will be coming here for another six or seven years for sure."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time the other day since I was really craving some Chinese food. Since this place was fairly close to me, I decided to give it a try. I'm all for supporting small businesses but I really wasn't a fan of my food. I ordered the general tso chicken combination plate. It came with 2 wonton crisps, an egg roll, and your choice of white or fried rice. (All for a very good price). They also throw in homemade sweet & sour sauce, soy sauce packets, and a fortune cookie (of course!). I felt like a grease ball after eating the chicken (smothered in sauce). The egg roll was very bland and super dry on the inside and the fried wontons were just OK. The ONLY thing I actually enjoyed was the fried rice. It tasted pretty good surprisingly!! However, I felt that it lacked the eggs and peas. I had about 3 peas in my 2 scoops of rice. I might go back here again when i'm craving chinese---only for the fried rice though!"}
{"text":"Stay away. The food is awful and the service is terrible. I can see why they make you pay first. The fried rice is like mush. it must have been sitting in a warmer for hours. The egg drop soup has so much potato starch in it it was so thick and nasty. Been sitting here for a half an hour after eating the gal has not checked on me once. The heat must not be on at all because it is cold in here. Just slightly warmer than the 50 it is outside. Once again stay away.  My first and last time here."}
{"text":"Chinese is Chinese and I have bad, disgusting and have had tasteless crap but this was tasty and speedy delivery and can't say anything bad!"}
{"text":"They make really good tofu dishes... way better than Wang's Kitchen, since the tofu here is fried, not breaded. They seem to be OK with substituting tofu for meat in most dishes. They also gave us the cutest little bonus calendar last time my husband and I ordered."}
{"text":"My only place to go for Chinese food. Sure it is not fancy nor is it very authentic, but if you are looking for something tasty and quick-here it is! 
They have a fantastic tofu bowl (Hot and spicy bean curd) which is perfectly spiced! Others have tried the meat meals and have never been disappointed. 
If you're looking to be snooty about your Chinese food, go somewhere else. Otherwise this place is perfect."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place for the first time since I just moved into the area and it was the worst service and food wasn't that great. I took over 2 hours for us to get our food delivered.  Called and hour later and they said the driver just left with the food and it took another hour after that to get our food. I only live 5 minutes away from this place. The mall has better \"asian\" food then this place. Will never order from again."}
{"text":"Was jonesin for some Chinese and they hit the spot.  Tofu was as I expected it should be.  Waiting area was a mess though.  If someone drops food all over you gotta just take a second and clean that sh*t up.  That said I guess it's my new Chinese spot now that I'm an Old Brooklynite."}
{"text":"Solid four stars.  Nothing is perfect, but it's fast, cheap, and delicious."}
{"text":"Great delivery, great food. Best in town!
Sometimes I try to venture out other than teriyaki though and am disappointed but, they still have my business!"}
{"text":"So my coworkers and I have ordered from this place a few times. The last time they mixed up one of my coworkers orders with someone elses. They told him they wanted the order they gave him BACK. He said he already started eating it, and they said they still wanted it back. He gave it back to them and we hoped they did not give it to the other person who actually ordered it. We should have learned our lesson after that experience, but we did not...

A few weeks later several of us ordered again. When my food came there was a MAGGOT in it. That's right, a MAGGOT! I told my coworkers and nobody wanted to eat their food after that. We immediately called and told them about the situation and instead of offering a REFUND and APOLOGIES, they argued with us and told us they would not refund us but simply give us 10% off of our next order. They never apologized and would not give us a full refund or any other compensation except for saying that next time we call we will get 10%. COMPLETELY RIDICULOUS! I am calling the health department. Hopefully I didn't eat anything harmful before my discovery."}
{"text":"Portions are large. You get a good amount of food for your money if you get a combo with egg roll, wontons and all the extras.

We call it the \"dirty Chinese\" place because the inside is insanely outdated and ugly. Doesn't look especially clean either.

The delivery is super fast and we've never had any problems with their employees- always nice and pleasant. At least, we think they are- there is quite a bit of a language barrier."}
{"text":"Just awful!  Honestly I don't know why the health department would permit this place to be open for its current state of (un)cleanliness.  I'm not disgruntled for these nice people, just disgusted.  You only need to look at the soda fountain and the trash can and I guarantee you will turn around and not order food here.  I suppose if you like their free delivery you never have to see where your food came from."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from China Wok, we ordered egg foo young the patties were small and were not seasoned well,the fried rice only had a few onions in it, not fried at all and their was very little of it and the egg rolls were soggy and not crispy. Omg the gravy was yellow and tasteless needless to say this was my first and my last visit it was not worth the price that they charged."}
{"text":"I love this Chinese food! We always order sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken and Mongolian beef. The food is delicious and definitely way better than your average Chinese delivery spot. Yum!"}
{"text":"Their food is disgusting rather eat at Panda Express and I don't even like that place!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the Chinese Delivery suggestion, Yelp! I ordered online using the Beyond Menu app, which was simple enough.

Delicious food. I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan (see pic) and Egg Drop Soup. Delivery arrived on-time. Will order delivery from here again!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, a roach crawled across the windowsill at the table as we were finishing eating our lunch today. We went based on the positive yelp reviews and are regretting our choice now. The food was decent but not worth the experience of seeing a roach after eating most of a plate of food."}
{"text":"BEWARE!  They say free local delivery, only 2 miles away, tried to add $3.00 onto my bill!  Thankfully I caught it and cancelled the order.  They said 2 miles is was VERY, VERY far away."}
{"text":"I ordered string beans with garlic and could eat it at all. This dish was made with a sauce that seem to have come from a chemical factory and tasted awful. I had to return it even though I did get my money back."}
{"text":"Gross and overpriced. Seriously feel like they just made up a price at the door. Lo mein tastes a bit fishy and has about 5 pieces of chicken in it. Bummer, they used to be ok Chinese food. We got no fortune cookies either."}
{"text":"WORST HOT AND SOUR SOUP EVER.  
I complained and they said they would make me more soup.
Just like yesterday, they made a big batch, heated some for me and put in vegetables and meats.
They raised the price to $4.00, the quality decreased to horrible.  I won't go back there.
When I told them I wanted a fresh batch, they said we just made this.ars.
I will not go back to this hole in the wall dump.
See my other one-star review about this dive."}
{"text":"I would say its your average Chinese take-out restaurant with all the familiar menu items.  I have eaten here a half a dozen times and haven't been disappointed yet.  That said, it has also never been amazing hence \"average Chinese take-out restaurant\".  They also deliver..."}
{"text":"I use this Place for delivery whenever I don't want Pizza or Burgers. The food is fine not the best but for the price its just fine. Plus delivery is fast."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place based on the reviews but since chinese food in Scottsdale is slim pickin's we decided to try it and were pleasantly surprised! Egg drop soup, crab angels, sweet and sour chx, and sesame chx... all good. Finally a decent place to order take-out from!:)"}
{"text":"my favorite Chinese spot. generous portions always fresh and great service"}
{"text":"Another great place for lunch.  Nothing special, just good food.  Always consistent.  The Mongolian beef and cashew chicken are always good.  They always have good lunch specials."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here, but I've never had anything that made me wanting to come back the next day.  This is probably a bit of a safer pick than yummy yummy up the street.  The lunch specials are decent while I think the dinner menu really isn't that great of a deal.  They have always gotten my order right and service is always prompt, but the one word best to describe them is decent."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying food from here ever since I moved back to Westlake in 2008, their egg rolls are out of this world and so is their gen tso's chicken, ANYONE I have referred to this place has loved it, can't understand the one bad review... this place is DA BOMB lol"}
{"text":"Price to quality for china wok is great. Their sushi and typical American Chinese offering are as good as you'll find elsewhere, even if it isn't the most \"authentic\". The Wok is a great lunch option for a typical weekday, but I wouldn't take a girl here to impress her."}
{"text":"I live 5 minutes away, food took 1.5 hours to get here. General chicken was sub par at best.. Everything else wasn't. No thank you"}
{"text":"Was told it was gonna be the best Chinese within my area, and it was pretty decent a lot better than I expected. Chow Mein was just how I liked it, which is always a 50/50 chance of being the right type, fried rice same as the chow mein, perfect! Beef and broccoli, perfect! Sweet and sour chicken might needed to be refreshed, probably going to go with pork next time but overall definitely going to see my business again."}
{"text":"It's hard to find decent Chinese food in the Valley.   They are one of the better ones.  Hot and Spicy Bean Curd was wonderful."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery here last night - the delivery was fast and hot which was a plus! However, the only good thing out of my whole order was the crab angels. My fried shrimp was super dry and unflavored and my boyfriend's orange chicken was dry, dry, DRY. Such a shame because they are super nice, fast delivery and good pricing. Might give this place a try again but not in the near future."}
{"text":"We went here a couple days ago and I wasn't impressed. I thought it was a nicer restaurant, but it ended up being like a fast food restaurant. We called in an order and asked for Mongolian beef and a separate order of fried rice. When we went to go pick up the order, he said there was 2 scoops of fried rice inside that came with the meal. Thank goodness we ordered egg rolls and some crab ragoon (which were good)  because if we only had a scoop of rice and the small portion of Mongolian beef we would of not been satisfied. I probably would not recommend going here again."}
{"text":"Honest business. Good food mostly had everything that they serve.
Great for in and out a little cozy if your more than four. To small to let your kids run around but, you should let that happen anyway."}
{"text":"Standard Americanized Chinese food, nearly the same menu as most other places. Convenient location between a few busy streets when you've just got a craving. Historically the hot and sour soup, as well as the egg drop soups are hot, soothing, and loaded with ingredients. Recently, the hot and sour soup was so gelatinous that parts of the what-would-be-liquid stood up on its own. So disturbing to imagine what it does to the body. Egg rolls and noodle dishes are more consistent.

Though there are a couple of small tables inside the door, this is definitely a carry out joint for me. I call ahead to avoid standing in the very small entryway against the people in the tables. Really, a place like this doesn't need much more so it's fine. They offer periodic coupons in mailings and menu after the bill hits a certain amount, if you remember to bring them with you!"}
{"text":"Despise the negative comments, this Chinese restaurant is REALLY good. My husband and I always order from here and we're alway greeted by friendly workers. As I assume it being family owned. You cannot miss the wonton soup! Generously served and delicious! As well for their other entrees, well served!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved to this area and were on the hunt for a great Chinese takeout place. So we searched on yelp and found great reviews for china wok, and we're very pleased with the service, location, and of course, the food! The house fried rice is a MUST , as we as their chow mein and egg drop soup, which, to us, are the most important part of Chinese food.

We have been back since then, and I will continue to order from them in the future!"}
{"text":"This was a great Yelp Find!  Had the typical delivery Chinese food craving so I looked for a good one!  Delivery was quoted about 30-45 minutes and it came in about 40!  I ordered the cashew chicken and crab angels, both were very delicious and was enough for 2 meals! Obviously your not expecting a 5 star restaurant but definitely would order from again!!"}
{"text":"What the literal heck!!!! I ordered their twice cooked pork w/ pineapples. This is a \"saucy\" dish, but they still packaged it in a paper box. (The boxes the rice is placed in) so literally they packaged liquid in paper. The sauce from my twice cooked pork leaked through the box and brown paper bag leaving a complete and utter mess in side the plastic bag the meat n rice where placed in. There was literally a pool of sauce. When I called and explained to them what had happened, they were not sympathetic at all. I got no apologies or no solutions to rectify this. I had to scoop my food out of the plastic bag to put it bag into the mutilated box to take the pic. I don't even know if it was good, because there was no way I was going to eat from the dirty bag. It was a waste of money. Anyone ordering from here, if you're not ordering something sauce free specifically request that's it's packaged in their soup containers since they don't have the common sense to instinctively do so."}
{"text":"{Actual Date of Visit: 12/14/2011}

I ordered the Hot & Spicy Bean Curd.  It was ok...  I'm still annoyed by the fact that decently priced combo specials in AZ are few and far between.  When I asked to substitute the white rice for fried rice, they told me I would have to make a side-order.  What is up with that out here?  Can't you just charge me extra? I KNOW for a fact that you have a big VAT of fried rice sitting in the back...Don't front like you make it fresh per order.  Anyway, I decided on the rice bowl size.  The meal was fine, just uneventful and a really small portion for almost $7.  Next..."}
{"text":"Went there on Saturday night to get some food to go. On of the worst Chinese Buffets I've seen. Half of the trays were empty and other half were almost empty. Very little selection. The worst pay is the take out prices: $10.50 to get a to go box(should be under 2lb) and 40 cents for every ounce after, WTF is that!!! So we just went somewhere else that night and didn't dine there at all. Bottom line: EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE."}
{"text":"i have been ordering from here for 2 years, haven't had a bad experience yet, no matter what i order they tell me it will be ready in 10 min, which gives me just enough time to run out the door and get there, it is always perfect never forget a thing.  Family run business explains the quality and consistency.

they don't pack their dishes with vegatables, hate it when you have to look for the meat like your digging for a prize, the prices are great and the portions are huge, crab angles are home made and very good......get them! 
you are about to find your new chinese food spot...and bonus! its right down the street from blockbuster.  ....................do it"}
{"text":"They seem to be really inconsistent. I've eaten here with good results, but recently ordered Beef and Broccoli, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and Orange Chicken, as well as Wonton Soup.

The soup tasted like warm oil, and the wontons were more like uncooked globs of noodle dough (yes, I know what that tastes like). The main dishes all had little to no sauce and we quickly gave up on actually finding any sort of meat in either chicken dish.

It wasn't the worst I've had but it wasn't good, and like I said I've eaten here a couple of times and every now and then it'll be pretty good, but just not consistently. I will say though that the delivery driver was extremely nice and upbeat. 

Overall, unless you are desperate, I'd try somewhere else. You may get lucky, but if not then you'll regret it."}
{"text":"I come here fairly regularly only because it is close to work and it's a buffet (when I'm craving more than just one dish). The food is mediocre, but I do really like the lo mein, egg drop soup, crab Rangoon, bbq chicken, and pepper chicken. There are others that aren't too bad. I find the general tso, which is a favorite of mine at most places is very mild and soggy. 

The people who ruin the place are interesting. The woman who is always there is sweet and always checking up on you. The man, however, is fairly rude and rarely acknowledges me even when he's the one at the cash register while I'm paying the bill. Convenience is the biggest thing that keeps me coming back though."}
{"text":"This was the worse chicken. Inside of the chicken was brown and green tint. The pieces were chewy and just horrible tasting. My 10 year old almost threw up when he took a bite. I would not recommend the sesame chicken or generals chicken .. Horrible."}
{"text":"China Wok is sure to please
When you want some tasty Chinese
The food is delish - delivery makes it easy
And you won't find it salty or the least bit greasy
The menu is varied and at a great price
And for you healthier folks, you can request brown rice."}
{"text":"I am in town to visit with a friend and while they were working I explored around and came up one this place.  I looked it up and it seemed to get ok ratings,  and since I wanted some sushi I thought I would check it out.  One great thing is that when you see actual natives, (chinese), eating there then I thought.. well it has to be at least decent.  I order 2 rolls Spicy Girl and Ocean roll b/c it was buy one get one half off. And I must say they are pretty good. They didn't use a whole lot of rice and the fish taste pretty fresh. And as you can see from my half eaten plate it is presented nicely as well. The only real complaint I have is that the ginger and the Wasabi aren't that fresh. And I love ginger, so I was a lil disappointed. And also if you choose to sit down to eat don't expect a true waitress service, they bring your food and that's about it.  Now I don't know if that's only for lunch b/c you have to order from counter then seat yourself. Dinner may be different. But other than that it is a decent place."}
{"text":"Gross, gross and gross. I should have walked back out the door as soon as a saw the 3 giant koi fish sharing a small aquarium.. so sad. Service was awkward and food was horrible. Thankfully my gf ordered veggie fried rice with no egg so they were forced to make something fresh. I ordered the combo  orange chicken with fried rice.  I literally had to spit the chicken back out in a napkin because it tasted so old and had a dog food smell to it. I gagged. The egg roll was salty and greasy and the wonton looked as if they were refried 3 times and sat under a heat lamp all day. So nasty, if I can give no stars I would."}
{"text":"The lunch specials aren't so bad.... But the food is your typical fast food Chinese place. Greasy, saucy, mediocre. 

Try the sesame chicken. The pepper steak is really overly sauced up but not too bad. The fried wontons are yummy but the egg rolls are super bland.   This place is good for hangover food or a good place to stop if you want really unhealthy Chinese to hit the spot.... I've had this feeling one too many times. Order on line and pick it up or they also deliver. 

Ummm side note... What's up with the HUGE goldfish looking thing in the fish tank? It's seriously too big to even swim in a tank that small. It literally can't move. I know it's just a fish but I feel like this is animal abuse."}
{"text":"Their food is not the best, my fried rice was under cooked but the thing that made me angry was my boyfriend called and they asked for delivery or picked up.. He was pleasantly surprised because we did not think they delivered, so he got it delivered a few times.. I was willing to giving them another chance, so we called to place a delivery order last night and the man said they don't deliver. I told him we recently had it delivered and he was very rude saying they never delivered.... Very confused!"}
{"text":"Wow.  That was a seriously disappointing meal.  I had the hunan beef rice bowl, which was not very good and not at all spicy.  I'm really glad I didn't order the wonton soup.  It had about a cup of cabbage, some miscellaneous veggies floating with one poor lonely vegetarian wonton in a bowl of what looked like dishwater.  Apparently it wasn't dishwater, though.  That might have had some flavor, not necessarily a good flavor but you get the idea.  Fail! I love some good ghetto Chinese food and I had high hopes walking into this place.  It has the right look.  I am walking out with a tummy ache and disappointment.  I won't be walking back in..."}
{"text":"The food would have been good if not so salty! It was difficult to eat! The combo includes an fried wonton, eggroll, two scoops of rice and main dish. The main dish had a good balance of meat and vegetables. They have a large variety of dishes to choose from. There is a great fish tank inside!"}
{"text":"The yellow curry was actually red and it was covered with red chili pepper. It was too damn hot for me and I couldn't eat it. They were nice enough to offer to make me something else, which I took them up on it. 

I ordered General Tso chicken and was much milder."}
{"text":"It was all right.  The vegetable egg roll was great.  The fried rice was ok.  I had chicken lo mein and the noodles & vegetables were good, but the meat was yuck.  I'm not sure what it is... I think I should only order items that do NOT have meat in them when I go to restaurants, because I commonly end up unsatisfied with the meat and it ruins the whole meal.  The checken was bland, tasteless, kind of gummy and some pieces were extremely gristly.

The fortune cookies were the good kind :) and they gave my boyfriend real pancakes w/his order (moo shu pork I think?)  He seemed to like his quite a bit.

PS it was delivery, not eat-in, and the delivery time wasn't horrible, but not super great."}
{"text":"I Yelped for Chinese delivery in the North Olmsted OH area and this place was the most highly rated, so I gave it a shot. I ordered the shrimp egg rolls, egg drop soup and the Kung Pao chicken.  The food took about 45 minutes to arrive (which is exactly what they told me on the phone when I placed my order) and it was actually piping hot when it arrived....yeah!  They even delivered it right to my hotel room....double yeah!!  The egg rolls were good, the soup was really good, and the Kung Pao was great (albeit very spicy).  I'll certainly order from this place again when here on business."}
{"text":"So far the best Chinese delivery we've had here in Madison. Their food is flavorful, fresh, and not super-greasy. 

They also have an online menu to order from, which is amazing! It makes life simple, and I don't have to worry that I mispronounce something or said the wrong thing entirely. 

The only complaint I had is that while our food was steamy hot, the crab rangoons weren't. They were actually a little on the cool side. But, it's delivery, so that's not all that surprising."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food. Probably the best chinese on or around Craig Rd. Food is always good and the delivery is quick and professional. Some of the yelping crowd are disingenuous, and they ruin yelp for everyone. Self absorbed little narcissists phone zombies who believe they matter. You don't."}
{"text":"I really don't understand all of the bad reviews for this restaurant. It is a buffet, not a sit down restaurant and is far and away the best Chinese buffet in the Madison area. And having eaten at close to 100 Chinese buffets around the country, I have no problem saying it is way above average.

The owners are there every day and even coming in for a late lunch, the food is usually still in pretty good shape. And having eaten many times at Imperial Garden, there are several items I would take off the buffet here first."}
{"text":"House fried rice is awesome. Delivery is fast and still hot. Add a little soy sauce and siracha and you're in fried rice heaven."}
{"text":"In general their food is pretty good quality. Noticed some odd off-taste with the lo mien. I usually get it to-go, and notice some of the cashiers lift on the container (to check how heavy it is?). The last time I went the cashier opened my container, closed it, opened it again, scowled at it, put it down, hesitated, and then with no explanation charged me an extra dollar over the posted take-out price.To me that's kind of rude--instead of thanking me for my patronage, they're giving me a scowl for no reason, or at least none that they told me about. I don't appreciate being treated that way"}
{"text":"Great food! I am a frequent customer. Good customer service and fast! Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Ordered two plates of chow mein and got two plates of rice... i knew i shouldve gone to panda express. Everyone told me this would happen but i didnt listen..."}
{"text":"Picked lunch up for the office and everyone was impressed! Their big portions make it nice so that we can all share! We ordered Moo Shoo Pork, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Fried Rice, Crab Puffs, Egg Rolls and Won Ton Chips. We'll be ordering from China Wok again!  -Momentum Brokers"}
{"text":"This review is based on the food alone. Per a friend's recommendation, we went by and got takeout. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken combo which came with the Kung Pao chicken, an egg roll, two wontons, & fried rice. The fried rice was cooked and seasoned well, but it was a little bit on the salty side. The chicken itself was delicious. It was spicy but I enjoyed it, and the best part was that it was full of vegetables & peanuts. They definitely didn't skimp on the portion side. The egg roll & wontons were just okay.

I didn't order the crab angels but my friends did & I definitely regretted that. They were large & full of the cream cheese & tasted great with the sweet and sour sauce.

We will be back."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and very good. Now, you can even order from an online menu. Our favorite Chinese food stop."}
{"text":"Normally they have good food and I've been many times. I must say don't get the curry chicken. A seven year old could make a better sauce. Super bland, small kick, taste like spiced chicken base. However, I do give 4 stars to their normal food. Personally, I've still had better chinese food ... But they are close and deliver!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a zero. General tsos was all breading. The chicken that was used was terrible quality."}
{"text":"I ordered this by accident. Thought I was ordering from No. 1 Chinese (which I love), but clicked the wrong button on yelp.
Chicken teriyaki: awesome! Very tender and flavorful with large pieces of chicken. 4 skewers.
Chicken fried rice: they have a lot of nerve calling this fried rice. It was slightly yellow, with some scraggly pieces of very white chicken and a few sprouts. So. Bland. No flavor whatsoever.
Shrimp lo mein: meh. Could've used more shrimp. The flavor was ok-ish.
Beef and broccoli: beef was very tender, broccoli was very fresh, but again NO flavor, especially no Chinese flavor.
Egg drop soup: and again...NO FLAVOR.
When I order (american) Chinese food, I usually expect some hint of (american) Chinese flavor. 
Will NEVER order again, I'll be sticking to No. 1 Chinese, which may not be perfect but at least had (American) Chinese flavor.
And I must add, the only reason they still have a decent number of stars is because for some reason the many other negative reviews have not been posted. But you can read them at the bottom of the page."}
{"text":"best chinese food  in las vegas.  they wll cook it the way you want it.  you can see them cooking.  super clean and very nice service."}
{"text":"I went to this place at 7pm. And most of the food was cold or warm some hot fresh food. That was good but not for 10.75.  The only thing was great was the ice cram."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food.. use to be one of the best... Last time we ordered it was delivered cold and there was a piece of plastic in the food... Would not recommend them."}
{"text":"If you are a Chinese food junkie like me, try another spot. This is the kind of place which gives Chinese food a bad name. Over-fried, greasy and downright tasteless. I had the Kung Pao combo.... the Kung Pao sauce was a gelatinous mess with everything from zucchini to bell peppers thrown in. It was actually hard to tell where the chicken was hiding. The \"alleged\" fried rice was still in the shape of the ice cream scoop when it arrived. The \"fried\" rice had fused into a starchy ball. And did I mention the egg roll. Hmmm, maybe I did't because it was one bite......and off to the trash."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in the meal I received tonight. I ordered a family meal with Kung pow chicken (that wasn't spicy at all, in fact it was quite flavorless) chicken with broccoli (which had little brown goo chunks that were disgusting and again, flavorless) and sweet and sour chicken (that my husband bit into and was not fully cooked). Overall the meal was lacking any flavors and my husband described as \"all tasting the same\". It was a horrible waste of $45 and next time I'll just cook at home."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place for months, and they never disappoint. They ALWAYS deliver quickly. The main dishes (fried rice, General Tso's entrees, etc) are always fantastic. They're hot and fresh. However, the side dishes (the egg rolls, dumplings, soup) are always sub-par. The egg rolls are dry, the dumplings are cold, the soups are cold, and it's just not...great. The solution? I order only the main dishes. If you haven't tried China Wok, do it. Just stick with the entrees."}
{"text":"It's a very basic take-out place.  I wouldn't actually eat there even though they do have 2 tables.  The staff was very nice but the food was very uneven.  We really liked the crab rangoon and the pork lo mein.  The chicken fried rice was OK too.  Everything else we got (egg rolls, sweet & sour soup, sweet & sour chicken, szechuan shrimp, Gen'l Tso's chicken, beef & brocolli) wasn't very good, especially for the price."}
{"text":"China Wok is getting 1 star simply because of extremely poor service.  Some of my coworkers ordered lunch delivered, as they do many times a month.  One of the orders were missing so we called the restaurant.  Not only did they want to charge extra to bring the correct food, they asked for the incorrect order back!!  We will never order from this restaurant again.  I also plan to alert the several hundred employees that work in this building of the poor service."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Everything I've tried has been spot on except the hot'n'sour soup. If you're a big fan of that- skip it here!!"}
{"text":"this food sucks!  it was horrible!  fried rice included soy sauce and carrots only!  no flavor.  the chicken dishes had fat on the meat.  i called and told them it was horrible and that i would not come back and they said, okay.  i spent $46 dollars on food that was awful and i definitely will not go again."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese place. Super-fast delivery, solid staples for a typical Chinese place. 

By far the best part of ordering China Wok is the phone call. I once dreaded the sharp orders coming through the other line, but I've come to appreciate the humor and adventure in successfully placing an order. Just make sure you check the menu first before you call. If you hesitate on the phone, watch out! (It's awesome)"}
{"text":"Average chinese buffet. Good food. Therere Better buffets around w larger food selections."}
{"text":"So far this is the only take-out chinese place I can tolerate in Scottsdale.  I would've never though that Nebraska and Iowa's chinese food would be worlds better than a big city like Phoenix, but I haven't found anything that really compares yet.  Anyways, I have tried chicken fried rice, sesame chicken, and sweet & sour.  I always start with the basics with a new place because if they don't have those done, they aren't gonna impress me.  Chicken fried rice is amazing with lots of egg and big chunks of white meat chicken.  The sweet & sour and sesame were just ok.  Portions were small and pieces of chicken were tiny.  But the sauce was good.  I am still on the search for excellent chinese but this place will do for now."}
{"text":"Not pleased. 

Yes, they have good portions.  Yes, its cool they deliver and are open til 930 every night.  Yes, the receptionist can speak English, which is not a prejudice comment, just a general fact after calling literally 7 Chinese restaurants who could not understand a single word i was saying. 

But the food that I received was sub-par.  It just didn't have any flavor!  The pot stickers were way overdone and oh too crunchy on the outside with very little filling on the inside.  The lo mien noodles were...awkward.  Half were bunched together , some were overcooked, some were undercooked; the veggies were waxxy and the beef in it was overcooked and under seasoned.  Seriously you messed up lo mien???  The generals chicken was just OK, not horrible but I've had better.  

All in all a poor experience, so bad I didn't even bother with the leftovers, which is usually my favorite part of a good Chinese meal!"}
{"text":"China Wok is amazing.... if you're a diabetic or have absolutely no taste buds that is.

My boyfriend bought us hot and sour soup which had NO flavor, was watered down, had barely any veggies or egg in it, chicken that was mediocre, beef wontons with way too much wonton that was all gummy, and cashew shrimp which had mostly sauce slop and barely any shrimp! The wonton crisps that they gave us on the side were stale. The shrimp dish had no flavor and we had to add our own seasonings to it to make it taste all right. We ordered extra rice which we didn't get. 

This place is the MOST BORING, TASTELESS CHINESE FOOD IN TOWN and their prices are not reasonable either. Try Asia Garden or China A Go Go instead. Their food actually has flavor and you can tell they care for their business and not just about saving money, unlike China Wok."}
{"text":"i really like china wok. like other reviewers have said, it is just average chinese food that delivers.

i've ordered many different things and have only been truly disappointed by the Dragon Phoenix Soup. this is gross, but it was the consistency of snot. everything else i've gotten from there has either been exactly what i expected or a pleasant surprise. 

they deliver and they're usually very quick about it, only had one incident that took more than an hour.

i will continue to order from this modest restaurant, it makes me happy."}
{"text":"Foods OK, for Pittsburgh, the service is terrible.
It's a dumpy neighborhood, so expect sleezy fat chicks and drunks."}
{"text":"Ok I wanted to try this place because of the price
Here's my order
Pork Egg Foo Young
Greasy dough balls and no sign of pork only had 3 bites
Mongolian Beef pedestrian at best but eatable
Pork Fried Rice sorry but there was no frying involved here
Chalk it up to the old axiom \" you get what you pay for\"
Only positive is it was hot delivered by Grubhub and well packaged 
But never again for me!"}
{"text":"Nice people, quick delivery... Bad food.
At least there was barely any chicken in my chicken lo mein... It was so dry I thought I was chewing on a carrot.
And my dinner was the best of the 4 of us. The chicken and broccoli looks full sitting in the trash... About to run out and grab a pizza since we are all still hungry."}
{"text":"Always great food!

Tonight I ordered delivery . Food was delivered by a very nice lady. I apologize I did not get her name. Wish everyone was as nice as her!

Black pepper chicken, beef chow mein, pot stickers and free crab puffs what was for dinner! We loved everything.

I love the bar when I actually go in- and need to go more often. 

To the delivery lady - you rock! :)"}
{"text":"It si exactly what you would expect for a strip mall Chinese place, except for one thing, the people there are really nice and willing to talk to you about the food or anything really. For example, I noticed that there was a distinct \"smoky\" flavor to their fried rice. So I was thinking maybe it was the pork they were using, but after talking a while figured out that it was the oil they had. That combined with the 700 degree woks impart a very pleasant smoky aroma and taste to the fried rice.

You can dine in (simple seating for about 16 people) or take out or have delivered. The dining room was clean and the restrooms were spotless as well.

The prices were good, my wife and I got away for under $15.00 for the lunch special (which include egg-drop soup if you dine in) but the dinner prices were not much more. To me any time the wife and I can get away for under $20.00 for a meal we feel lucky. Heck, two people at McDonald's can easily pay more than $15.00 for a meal.

If you are in the neighborhood and want lunch, give it a try."}
{"text":"As a first timer, this was good for lunch. Nothing fancy, but the food was hot and yummy. 

A side note; the fish in the fish tank creep me out. They are Huge and way too large to enjoy life in the small tank... Just saying."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout Moo Shu Vegetables. Delivery was faster than expected, but the food was horrible. The vegetables were over-cooked, mostly shredded cabbage, sitting in so much liquid that I had to use a slotted spoon to get something I could put on a tortilla. That's right - tortillas in place of pancakes. Not the same. I did think the wonton soup was good - large wontons, well-stuffed, plenty of them. But not good enough to make me order from here again."}
{"text":"Excellent Delivery Chinese Food. Comes Hot & Fast!!! Honey Garlic II is the best!!!!! Love the crab angels too! Everything we have tried has been delicious. We are bummed because we moved from the area and miss ordering China Wok."}
{"text":"I don't know jack about authentic Chinese food, but if it's been a rough day and I just want to spend the night working down my dvr list then this is the perfect companion."}
{"text":"Wontons were mush, and tasted terrible.  The rest of the Wor Wonton soup was really good however.  Wierd.  The King Triple Delight was just so-so.   Very average, not great flavor, but not bad.  Other than the inedible wontons in the wonton soup, just a meh rating from me.  They were nice, but I won't return."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place. All the booths had dirty tables and we had to ask to have them wiped down. I ordered a rice noodles soup and it wasn't too tasty either.  Not a fan!"}
{"text":"Not good, not BAD, this place is a fine choice if you're looking for totally mediocre but plentiful food. That being said, I would not recommend the place to friends."}
{"text":"I'm all about the mom and pop places and that is exactly what China Wok is. Family ran and very friendly. I ordered a small (plenty big) beef chow fun and my daughter ordered the orange chicken lunch.
The chow fun was exactly like what you get in Hong Kong. It was served piping hot with plenty of meat and veggies and just the right amount of sauce. Not to saucy and not to dry.
My daughters serving of orange chicken was massive. Lots of crispy chicken again with the right amount of sauce. It came with two generous scoops of rice and a few fried wonton."}
{"text":"Very nice staff considering the aesthetics of the little place. And the service is super fast! ....very impressive! The food, curry chicken and the hot and sour soup, was like none other. This \"small shop\" of an establishment did the dang thang ok! I'm a fan!

They deliver as well; I'll try the service out whenever I get a Chinese food craving again."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday evening and it was fairly busy. Ho-hum selection. The shrimp entrees were well stocked (there were 3-4 avail). The sushi wasn't much. There was also crab legs and mussels. Nice place for a last minute dinner decision."}
{"text":"its cheap chinese food. they have a lot of options but the quality and passion are lacking. i would not go back here unless a group really wanted to."}
{"text":"Alright so I have ordered two lunch specials from here in the past. I tried the chicken with broccoli as well as the orange chicken, which both come with their fried rice. These lunch specials are fairly standard for a Chinese restaurant like this so I can do a comparison with other restaurants in the area. The chicken with broccoli was decent and I liked the sauce that they used. However, the orange chicken was not very good and definitely not what I expected. What surprised me the most was that their fried rice is actually quite good that they make in house.

As I only ordered take-out I can't really comment much on their service. The food has always been on time with when they say it will be ready and the prices for the food is reasonable."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time Wednesday got the general Tao's chicken I ate 1 third of it threw it in the trash there was no flavor the wonton soup was boring the only highlight of the meal was the chicken wings the egg rolls taste like sawdust I hate to give any restaurant a bad review but they really need to re evaluate the kitchen!!"}
{"text":"First of all, China Wok is located in the Food 4 Less parking lot on Craig and Simmons. 
Secondly-- Holy crap! How is this place NOT getting at least four stars? I'm always skeptical about Chinese food so if I'm impressed, I think that means something. 

I called in my order on a Saturday and the woman on the phone was super friendly. She said the food would be ready in ten minutes but it was actually more like 20 minutes, which was relieving because 10 minutes would have been suspicious. We got three lunch specials (shrimp in garlic sauce, shrimp and broccoli and Mongolian chicken), one order of egg rolls and one order of crab rangoons. The lunch specials each came with a side of rice (fried or steamed). All the food tasted fresh, the shrimp were gigantic (about 5 or 6 pieces per order), and the order of crag rangoons was generous for the price (about 10 large pieces.) 

They advertise that they're \"New York Style\" and I'm not sure what this means because it seemed to be the same \"style\" as any other take-out Chinese food restaurant in the Las Vegas area. But in China Wok's favor-- the menu is huge, the food is fresh and flavorful, and portions for the lunch specials are generous for $5.95. 

In the three dishes we got, the meat to vegetables ratio was probably 2 to 5, which is great for someone interested in healthier fare but possibly disappointing for someone who's expecting a lot of meat. Anyway, the variety of vegetables was good and the meat is good quality.

The inside of the restaurant is kind of run-down looking but when you look closely, it's very clean and well-kept. I guess the age of the building and the style of the furniture just don't really help it out at all.

The cashier asked me if I'd like some soup while I waited and I declined, but it's a gesture worth noting. 

Overall, I'm actually looking forward to going back and trying more things on the menu. Fresh, healthier food for $5.95 a plate? Hell yeah. That's cheaper than a meal at a lot of fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered Snow White Chicken combo which was very light and healthy in terms of the right amount of sauce and no unneeded salt, let the ingredients shine...just the right amount of flavor. Perfectly cooked veggies, and tender juicy white meat chicken, surpassed expectations on quality and taste, I'll order this again."}
{"text":"This Chinese take out place is pretty good. I like their hot and sour soup and the chow fun.

However this order was not up to par. The wonton soup was more like vegetable soup with some wonton skins.
And the beef chow fun didn't have enough flavor. I had to resort to some soy and chili.

Hope it's better next time"}
{"text":"So yummy!

I love coming here - the food is beyond delicious, it doesn't take too long and the customer service is so friendly! They always make sure your food is alright, you have enough water and are always there to listen to feedback. 

By far one of the most authentic Chinese food places - the chicken and soup is delicious and fresh. It always helps when the food comes quick, tastes scrumptious, AND the people are so kind!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for about a year now, and i have to say China Wok has never treated me poorly. the food is good and the delivery is on point. I enjoy eating here and taking friends."}
{"text":"It's fast food chinese. Even better take-out. You can re-enact like the Hollywood movies with their Chinese take-out boxes. I never dined in because like most people, take out is perfect option for escaping cooking responsibilities. I did notice the rather large Koi fish trapped in the tank that I wanted to set free!

Generous portions. Cheap. It's perfect amount of grease and saltiness to soak up weekend shenanigans. Choose the fried pork pot stickers, grab an order of the Shrimp Chow Fun. The Hot and Sour Soup is not a bad option either. Besides, I always look forward to the wisdom of the fortune cookie of how lucky my night will end!"}
{"text":"Ice tea was bad. Food ok, pretty clean place, dirty fish tank, fish waay to big for tank"}
{"text":"my favorite local chinese restaurant.  there is nothing fancy about the food, but it is always tasty.  the staff is very friendly.  I recommend the honey garlic chicken and the spicy bean curd."}
{"text":"Been going here since 2007 ever since being a duquesne student. Love it. They delivered to anywhere on campus. Besides being convenient, quick, and accomodating, their food is special in a weird way. Homey, not too greasy. Imo I liked them more before their remodel. They had more seating and didn't try to food newcomers with their appearance. Regardless, their lunch specials were a great value. My professer and I always talked them up on campus."}
{"text":"I love china wok!! Ever since moving out here's years ago I've been looking for a good Chinese food place in Arizona and when I found china wok I stopped looking. I have to have it at least 3 times a week. They know my order I go so much.  Everything is fresh and they make it quick."}
{"text":"Some of the food on the buffet is quite good. The Szechwan pork and barbecue pork stand out in my recollection. The fried rice is memorable for its blandness and frozen peas and carrots. Cabbage was apparently the only ingredient that they could find to stuff their egg rolls with.

This gets lows ratings for staff and service. We were barely acknowledged upon entrance and completely ignored when attempting to pay. One drink refill arrived at all, and even then it was about 7 minutes later than desired. The manager chatted quite loudly on his phone while we and several others tried to settle our bills. He grunted in lieu of speaking and made his best effort to lob the receipts over the counter to avoid ever being within 6 inches of his customers."}
{"text":"About a year ago I went to China Wok- it was horrible. I would have rated it 1 star had I been a yelper back then. 

But, the other day, I was looking for a new Chinese food place to order delivery from and accidentally ordered from China Wok. When I hung up the phone I realized what I had done and almost called them back to cancel, but decided to give them a try.... I have to say, it wasn't bad. It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. 

The noodles were way overdone, the wantons were inedible, the friend rice was way to salty, but the main dishes made up for it. The Orange Chicken and the Sesame Chicken dishes were both very flavorful and I am pretty sure they were both made with white meat. 

This place is comparable if not better than any visit to Panda Express. Very much Americanized Chinese food I have to give it 3 stars solely for the main dishes I tried."}
{"text":"A lot classier on the inside than the outside would lead you to believe.  Food was pretty good as far as American-Chinese food goes.


My top recommendation here would be the szechuan beef noodle soup."}
{"text":"I always get their Shrimp with veggies. Super yummy low guilt. My son had Kung pow Chicken with generous helping of peanuts and just the right amount of heat/spice. Crab Angels were amazing however there  is no crab in them ... But tons of flavor! My mom had sweet and sour chicken was ok. Their fried rice is consistently delicious. 
They have free delivery also! This is definitely our go to Chinese food place for now."}
{"text":"Fast delivery. Debility arrived hot and it was pretty good. Nothing amazing. Cheap and good portions. My husband got sweet and sour chicken and I got chicken and broccoli- easy meals."}
{"text":"We love this place! We do delivery. We always have an early morning due to my husband working overnights and order when they are closed but our order is here 20 minutes after they are opened. Their Singapore Noodles are Awesome and Orange Chicken are faves for our house! Try them you will mot be disappointed."}
{"text":"No vegetarian options, and staff always too busy and not personable."}
{"text":"I usually get the crab rangoo, General Taos chicken and the mooshu pork, all of them come rather consistent and delicious. This time I ordered the Kung Pao chicken by bias confusion and  the jumbo shrimp on a limb.  First off there's nothing jumbo about these shrimp except the breading it's fried in. I had to break open and search for the shrimp and when I found it I could've sworn it was imitation crab meat, it could've been for all I care because I through it in the trash where it belonged. I had to eat one more bite to search for the flavor but they must've forgot that too. 
Everything else was good as usual but the shrimp should've been forgotten at China wok and I wouldn't have mind."}
{"text":"I live in the area and get lunch delivered to my house from here anytime im in the mood for chinese. Their spicy house chicken is amazing fried goodness with rice noodles and hot red chili's. They have cheap lunch deals and only require $10 to deliver. Is it the best chinese food in phoenix? No. Is it really good, inexpensive, and available? Yes. Good job China Wok, keep it up."}
{"text":"Usually when I eat here, my food is good. However, today I ordered from here and the food deserved zero stars. I ordered their General Tso Chicken. I mean, I can't believe they even served me the food that they did. The rice was over cooked and extremely sticky and the chicken was so dry, almost inedible. 
I would not recommend this place to anyone. If you're looking for decent Chinese in the south Scottsdale area, go to New China Gate on McDowell/Hayden."}
{"text":"Really nice staff and really fast delivery. Disgusting over cooked chewy stringy general chicken with chunks of cartilage. I ordered extra sauce and didn't get it. I ordered and paid for hot oil and didn't get it. The crab Rangoon were over cooked and really paste like bland because I had no hot oil or general sauce to dip in so I just threw them away.
My coworker loved her fried rice and shrimp so they get 3 stars even though the garbage can ate my dinner."}
{"text":"I have ordered here several times, always delivery.  I am from the Midwest and the Chinese here is exactly like that. We always get the egg foo young, which is excellent if you've never tried it.  Fried rice, egg rolls, veggie with meat dishes...always good.  The only thing I really didn't care for is the seafood with white sauce.  The sauce was kinda bleh and the imitation crab just ruined it for me.  Delivery is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but they left out the egg rolls that were meant for my combo specials. I understand that I ordered food close to closing time, but leaving out food that I rightfully paid for is unacceptable. I will no longer stop here nor will I recommend it to other patrons"}
{"text":"I ordered steamed dumplings, Kung Pao Chicken, and Hot and Sour soup. The lady was very nice on the phone and they got my order exactly.

The food came when they said it would and it was hot! The ingredients definitely taste fresh and the food was well made. My only complaint is that the H&S soup was a little too salty for my tastes. Regardless, I'll definitely order from here again! :3"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  I went there for lunch a few days ago and had their General Tso special which included fried rice for less than 6 bucks.  Came out hot, crispy, and just fantastic.  I gotta admit, part of the reason it was so fantastic is I ate it at their restaurant, I think once it probably sits in the container it steams out the crispness.  I used to visit the restaurant a few years back, and WOW, they did an awesome job renovating/and or maybe moving it down the street?!?  Looks great!!!!"}
{"text":"I just recently discovered this place thanks to coworkers.  We all were hungry and for some odd reason they were determined to get Chinese.  They recently ordered from here and spoke highly of it, so I thought what the heck, let's give it a try.

I do have to say that the bright spot of it all is the amount of time it took for us to receive our food.  It was not as long of a wait as you would have expected.  When the food arrived it smelled great.  Each combo seems to be served with pork fried rice and an egg roll.  I went with old faithful General Tso's.

The chicken itself was nicely cooked, but the sauce was heavy on the peppers used to spice it.  I'm fine with spicy food, but leaving such big chunks of those peppers in the sauce was a bit of a turn off.  As far as the rice it was not the best fried rice I have ever had.  I'm not a fan of pork to begin with and this was riddled with bits of it made me think twice about devouring it.

Just because I had a poor showing with this the first time around, doesn't mean that I will the next.  I'll just make different choices."}
{"text":"Hope you like cockroaches... If they don't bother you then the place is great  Nothing like taking a big bite of chicken fried rice and then a cockroach crawling by you on the table."}
{"text":"You know what, man?  I LIKE China Wok.  I've been here a few times and whenever I go, I get a mountain of food.  I always forget how big the portions are, so whenever I see the final price at near $10 I'm like, damn, kinda pricey for American Chinese Food... then I get like two deals of rice, an egg roll and a fortune cookie that doesn't tell me any sort of fortune whatsoever (\"the closes distance between friends is laughter....\" but what does my future hold, cookie?!).

Inside is totally fine.  I've been to a lot of quick-stop Chinese food places with flickering lights that hum nauseatingly and have a dirty fish tank with a single beta fish who I can tell is contemplating suicide.  Here, though, the inside is a little cheesy but it's clean, fun and doesn't make my head split open.

They also deliver, which is always good to know.  Also, in the shame shopping center is a 4:20 evaluations thing, so if you're suffering chronic pain, you can self-medicate and then nom out with your, uh... mom out?"}
{"text":"This is a great, no-fuss neighborhood place. The staff is friendly; the food is good and consistent. We've tried a few different chicken dishes and they were all very tasty."}
{"text":"Based on the Szechwan Chicken and the Spicy Chicken dishes two stars seems about right.

The menu here states that the spicy chicken would be in a bean sauce but we received it in approximately eighty percent sriracha sauce and the rest was mostly oil. This was the better dish.

The Szechwan Chicken I couldn't eat because it was extremely sweet and could have passed for a dessert sauce.

Both meals were made with nicely cooked white meat chicken. The vegetables in both dishes were bell peppers, onions and mushrooms that were a good ratio. They gave us two plates of white rice that were approximately three cups each.

Maybe other dishes on the menu are better I don't know.

This place is very casual you order at the counter and seat yourself.

I do note this place is very clean and spotless."}
{"text":"It was pretty good for fast food Chinese, did take a long time for the order to be delievered though."}
{"text":"I order Wor Won Ton, and while there were some won ton noodles, none of them had any pork meat. Called and was told that they are pre-manufactured and nothing they could do about it. Also that they've been serving it like this for the past 10 years...WTH?

I bought some wor won ton from a China Wok in Queen Creek last night, delicious with plenty of won Tom noodles that had meat. Thought both location were affiliated but according to the guy on the phone they're not.

I'm no stranger to Chinese food having just moved here from San Francisco."}
{"text":"Two stars for the fact that the delivery was quick and food was hot. But the food falls flat - not sure what it tastes like but it isn't good. We ordered the curry, which I guess isn't typical Chinese food, and it was terrible! Didn't taste like curry at all. The only positive was the egg roll. Had high hopes for this place as a quick and easy take out option but we won't be back."}
{"text":"They're amazing. I order from them religiously. Whether I have it delivered or I pick it up. They're sweethearts and they throw in some stuff they know I enjoy on the house (that's how much I order from them). I love that everything is hot and cooked to order. They have the best chicken on a stick ever!!! And the spicy chicken is amazing!!!!

I totally recommend going there when you get a hankering for Chinese."}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming back here. The food is mediocre at best. Go spend a few more dollars at Imperial Garden up the road. This is your run of the mill chinese buffet."}
{"text":"Someone has to show this place some love.  I've been a regular for about 8 years.  The wonton soup is delicious.  The chicken fried rice and lo mein are good as well.  Try this place.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Found a place plastic coated wire in my food delivered last night. I'm disgusted and will never eat this food again!"}
{"text":"the price does not match, charging 2.00 dollar for ice tea when the menu said 1.60.
Fried rice is bad.
Overall, unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Best takeout Chinese I've had in a while. Crab Rangoons are amazing. Lots of cream cheese filling. Very reasonably priced. This place is definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"I randomly found this place through a couple of friends and it has become one of my FAVORITE Chinese restaurants in AZ. I have driven WAY out of my way to have a taste of there Honey Shrimp. Their cream cheese ragoons A-MAZING and have to order a whole batch for myself. This is no Pei Wei-type fancied-up type pf place. This place is all about the food."}
{"text":"I love this place for delivery chinese.  As everyone else has said, it is decent food, not the best or very authentic, but for delivery chinese it takes the cake.  I love the house special chicken and their rice that comes with the entree is actually very good.  I wouldn't recommend anything off the beef menu and the seafood menu scares me, but the chicken dishes I've tried have all been pretty good.  If you're looking for a decent priced chinese delivery, you'll want to check this place out."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've eaten here a million times and I always forget to leave a review because I'm too busy eating their yummy food to thinking clearly enough to type anything.  I'm a sucker for their appetizers and could easily eat nothing but food off the appetizer menu.

I like it here so much that twice I've driven the 20 miles away from my house to get food here. Although generally I try to only eat here when near work, but there are a few times where the cravings are so strong I can't resist.

And their chicken sticks, so yum! When I bring them home my pit bull starts circling me like a shark.  I just want to strap a fin to her back and let her go at it circling the table.

She's yet to kill me over these sticks because she knows if she gives giant puppy eyes enough, I'm lame and I'll cave into giving her a taste. But let's just say if I was choking, she'd use the opportunity to jump on the table and take my food rather than pull a Lassie and get me help.  She loves me, but she loves this food more."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese restaurant. Been here a few times now. Prices are very responsible considering being right by the area, along with portion sizes."}
{"text":"Use to be in love with this place.  The effects have worn off.  Not impressed.  You still get large quantities of the food but I dunno if I care... Sometimes I'd bite into a piece of general tao that tasted weird.  Why would one piece of chicken taste different from the others? It doesn't make any sense. Somethin's off. I'd still go back for redemption general tao."}
{"text":"I ordered my food an hour and 17 minutes ago.  I'm so hungry, why won't you bring me my food?

I get it, you're probably busy, then don't take my order.  I'll come pick it up, I promise.

edit: Called them once at an hour and once at an hour 20, each time they said he just left 5 minutes ago. Totally ridiculous, I will never order from them again. The teriyaki chicken skewers were really good though, so I'll give them 2 stars, but barely."}
{"text":"I love their sesame chicken and crab ragoon. On this side of town I do believe they are the best chinese takeout.  Just get annoyed be side they already have a ten dollar delivery minimum and then also take on a three dollar delivery charge. I feel like it should be one or the other but still worth it."}
{"text":"They're just ok. We have 2 options in Brentwood and this is the our second choice. Free pop or egg roll with a purchase over a certain amount. And good family meal deals."}
{"text":"This place is not spectacular, but it's probably the best Chinese delivery option in town."}
{"text":"First time ordering, and last. I ordered bourbon chicken and am ABSOLUTELY sure this was not chicken. It looked like hunks of pig feet.  Won ton filling had an odd flavor.  Sweet and sour chicken was very oily tasting.  Fried rice was yellow rice. Egg roll was decent but again very oily tasting."}
{"text":"Popped in one evening for some to-go...Standard fare for takeout \"Chinese\" food. Wasn't disappointed but wasn't blown away either. Would I go back? I do believe I would as it was still pretty good and yes the portions were healthy! Two days worth of munching!!!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place after getting my lashes does and not let me tell you this is the best Chinese food iv had since iv moved to Vegas 3 years ago... I love north Vegas and this little hole in the wall is the place to go, lunch specials are a great deal and good amount of food also! If you up this way you have to stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"If they still had the General TSO from a few years ago I would give it 5 stars. I miss that recipe. The new recipe seems a little more bland than the one from a few years ago. Overall I have ordered food from them for many years and never had any issues. Quality food and service."}
{"text":"Great Chinese spot in Brentwood Town Square.  The place is very clean and bright inside.  They have a lot of different options to choose from.

I had the general tsos chicken.  The chicken was crispy even after my drive home.  Sometimes Chinese food ends up soggy, but this held up well.  The chicken was not overly sauced either.  The flavor of the sauce was some of the best general tsos I've ever had.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ok first of all I'm moved from San Francisco to Scottsdale, I always thought that San Francisco has the best Chinese food ever, but last night I looked up for Chinese delivery places and I found this, at first I don't want to order Chinese because I'm in Arizona but I did it anyways so it turns out this Chinese food is so good and cheap.
I would totally bring my family here from San Francisco for Chinese food. Definitely 4 stars:3"}
{"text":"Oh....
My....
God....

It's been a loooooong time since I've been served food this bad before. We ordered beef egg foo young, honey garlic pork, barbeque ribs, and it came with white rice.

The rice was good, and was by far the highlight of our meal. 

The beef egg foo young was some sort of high-density hockey puck (that was supposed to be the egg foo young). It had the texture of leather, but didn't taste as good as leather. It was slathered with a brown gravy that had pieces of beef, but the beef was gristle-y and unappetizing. 

The BBQ ribs looked very good, but this was misleading. One taste suggested this food had \"turned\" and we didn't eat any more for fear of getting sick.

The honey garlic pork dish was tolerable. It was small breaded pieces of pork in a sauce that tasted neither like honey nor like garlic.

The white rice was good and sticky, as white rice should be.

The restaurant was clean, to their credit, including the bathroom.

I will NEVER go to this place again. It's hard to believe a place this bad remains in business. It wasn't even particularly well-priced."}
{"text":"ok, so the hotel gave me this place since it delivered and we wanted Chinese. I think Id have rather waited for the shuttle and made the extra effort to go elsewhere. EVERYTHING  in this order was gross  except for the duck sauce  and the chicken wings. We ordered CHEESE wontons, egg rolls, sweet and sour shrimp, pork fried rice, chicken wings, spareribs. 

They never gave us ANY cheese wontons. I had added more cheese wontons but the entire order had a bunch of completely rock hard wontons that literally you couldn't chew. They had some sort of rock hard sinewy meat... disgusting. The shrimp were hard and tasted old. The fried rice was bleu. the ribs were not edible. My son said they were the worst he ever had. The egg rolls were just mushy old tasting...they do NOT taste fresh or homemade. The other two and a half out of three got left in the bag. 
 

I looked at my order and called them to find out what happened to the cheese wontons. They claimed I hadn't ordered any cheese wontons but fried ones. I told them they were inedible and they claimed they would remove them from the order. We threw out most of the food except for the chicken wings and ordered room service. Heres my order. You decide: 

SKU Item Price Qty Sub-Total
1 Pork Egg Roll $1.40 2 $2.80
2 Shrimp Roll $1.50 1 $1.50
6 Chicken Wing $5.15 1 $5.15
39 Sweet & Sour Shrimp ((Sm.)) $6.15 1 $6.15
17 Roast Pork Fried Rice ((Sm.)) $4.65 1 $4.65
8 Bar-B-Q Spare Ribs ((L10)) $11.95 1 $11.95
10 Fried Cheese Wonton (6) or Fried Wonton (10)  
+Extended:Fried Wonton (12)
$3.95 1 $3.95( I even said to her, \" Even if you say I added on \"fried wontons\" I can see that I ordered cheese wontons as well... she insisted I didn't .)"}
{"text":"The menu says , \" Finest szechwam, mandarin, and hunan cuisine, in Scottsdale.\" That may be a personal preference, but their sesame chicken is tremendous. It is not too spicy, no odd additives like vegetables . The portions are ample and required me to take some home (that usually does not happen). The only downfall is that the food is a bit pricey, but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of China Wok. Since the remodel, you can sit down and have a waitress serve you. They also have sushi at a great deal... $7 for 2 rolls, $10 for 3 (for the basic rolls.. some examples are shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, salmon. Some also have cream cheese, cucumber, avocado, ect. )  They also have another page for sushi entrees which is much larger and a more unique choice of their sushi. We've always enjoyed ourselves here."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice on door dash and both times they were out of several things. I just tried to order 4 items and 3 of them were canceled as they said they were out of them. I tried to cancel the whole order as 3 of us would not be getting food and they refused! Worst customer service ever! What a waste! I will not be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends about a week ago for dinner. I ordered the egg drop soup and broccoli with chicken. Overall, it was good but not great. The egg drop soup was extremely hot, even 20 minutes after I got it, but was ok tasting. The broccoli and chicken was good just had too much sauce for my taste. 

I'd probably have lunch here next time instead of dinner."}
{"text":"I have eaten dinner at this casual American Chinese restaurant a few times so far, and I am sure that I will eat here many more times, given its location to my apartment and Consol Energy Center. However, the food tastes just OK, and I am extremely uncomfortable with how the restaurant writes our credit card number in our email, on the receipt that the delivery person's brings, etc. The restaurant does have some seating inside, but it can fill up with customers when a hockey game is about to begin across the street."}
{"text":"This is NOT your average crappy Chinese takeout. Sure, they have all your typical crappy Chinese dishes, but this place is so much more. The Gyoza Dumplings are some of the best that I've had, the sushi isn't amazing, but it's definitely above average, and SUPER cheap. I would highly recommend dining in, just so you can see first hand how these restauranteurs actually care about the product that they are giving their clientele. However, I have had delivery and takeout, and they are the holy trinity of deliciousness. Anytime you're around PPG arena give these guys a try, I highly doubt you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!!! 16 minute delivery and the food was really really good. House Egg Foo Young seemed a bit pricey at $8.95, but I tried it. I was very happy. It was the star of my meal. Soup was top notch. The only thing that wasn't way better than par was my General Tso's. That was on me because I spent the time enjoying the soup & egg foo young, and the chicken had no chance of staying crispy. The flavor was on point. The have the spices at a level for the average American. I will ask for a bit more spice next time. Thank you China Wok!!!!"}
{"text":"Good neighborhood Chinese food.  The place is clean the Asian folks are nice people. The same young lady has waited on me every time I pick up food.  Sesame chicken is really good but the Orange chicken is one of the best!  Eggrolls are good too!  Oh...they deliver if you're in the OB!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pork fried rice, and the honey garlic chicken. Order took 10 minutes to pick up once called in."}
{"text":"Can't beat the prices!!  Great food and service!!  I ordered take out-the house special with noodles, first off the container was so full and heavy plenty of beef, chicken, and shrimp.  Definitely well worth the price!!  I also got the crab angels which were great. I even was able to get my boyfriend to try it and now he likes Chinese food too!!  So we'll definitely be going here more now!!"}
{"text":"I live close by and stop in periodically and have not had any issues with food or service.  I have left full and happy every time.  

Hot food...all the sushi you can eat!

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The chicken and vegetable soup was heavenly! My all time favorite when feeling under the weather. Does a body good!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese that I've been able to find. I'll order the lunch specials and take home for dinner since it's closer to work than home. Haven't been disappointed yet"}
{"text":"Chinese delivery that actual tastes good! The egg rolls are sooo good not your typical basic bland food. I got vegetable fried rice and beef with broccoli. A lot of vegetables and good flavor! The beef with broccoli was so tender and the sauce was delicious. So glad I found this place"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for dinner. Got beef chow mein. The food was so dry. No taste. No flavor. So bland. :/ Also the delivery took more than 1 hour. 
Have to say I won't be ordering here again."}
{"text":"Great option for a pre-concert meal.  I don't think there is much competition in the way of Chinese cuisine in the neighborhood,  so it seems to do a steady business.
The menu offers plenty of options. I noticed they also offer delivery and catering services.
Service was extremely fast.  Barely any wait at all for our food.
I tend to grade places on their spring rolls, and the salt content of their sauces, so this explains the 3 stars.  They also used way too much raw American celery in my dish.
Overall, it was a good stop before  a concert since most of the other places in the area are overcrowded and overpriced.
BYOB is always a plus!"}
{"text":"My diet is 95% chicken and rice, so when I can't make it at home I go to rice bowl restaurants. The only problem with this is I am weirdo when it comes to hot food and styrofoam. When in contact with hot food it  leaches neurotoxins styrene and benzene. Very very bad so stop drinking coffee and eating food from styrofoam. 

Anyway I asked them to put my hot chicken and rice into one of their ceramic bowls and although not understanding why, they happily complied. Thank you China Wok I will be back often just because of this. 

Oh and my food was good :)"}
{"text":"Standard Chinese American takeout -- I'd recommend for a quick, cheap meal.

Service was great... polite on the phone taking my order, quick turnaround time, and a friendly greeting upon pickup. Prices are good, and so is the food!

I had the sesame chicken combo. The chicken had a crispy outside, which I prefer! And the pork friend rice was tasty (it's yellow rice). Looking forward to trying the orange chicken, too, based on reviews."}
{"text":"This is a typical 'chicken/beef soaked in sauces' Chinese delivery place, but they are quick and friendly. The price is reasonable and there aren't many areas one can complain about. 

I ordered, as per other user's suggestions, the honey garlic chicken. They don't combine the rice with the meat so they are left separate--I prefer it like this. 

I ordered the 'combo' which came with an egg roll and three things they called cream cheese wontons. Unfortunately they didn't contain any cream cheese, definitely skip those. 

The portions were more than enough to feed me this time, and I was damn hungry."}
{"text":"Holy crap....this place is disgusting. I tried them one time and I'll never walk in again. We bought generals chicken combo and Kung Pao chicken combo. We both took one bite and thew it away. The chicken tasted like it was hella bad. I bet it's cooked, Frozen and then thawed when ready to serve. It tasted like fish and I wanted to throw up. I called them to tell them it was terrible and tasted like fish, they offered me my $ back but I denied it. I wanted them to know I was serious about the food being spoiled. Don't risk it."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese can be had here. We came prior to seeing Raw at the arena. The shrimp and langostino dish I had was yummy as were the dumplings. Very clean too."}
{"text":"Cheap with nice service. 

Wonton soup was not the best I've ever had because the noodles were kind of undercooked. I'm a big salt fan--so was the Roasted pork fried rice. If you're not though, this might not be the dish for you.

Overall, it's ok. Non-complicated food for non-complicated people. It's better than TGIF (which is across the street) and their clientele."}
{"text":"Americanized Chinese food that is overwhelmingly average. Enough said.

NOTE: I may be spoiled by many trips to Toronto and Windsor for dim sum."}
{"text":"Yuck yuck yuck!!! I would never recommend this place to anyone!!! The food was so bad I would not even take the leftovers home I don't know how this place is going to stay in business!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for some takeout lunch. The food was pretty good (got the Bourbon Chicken and fried rice) and they were pretty quick in preparing it (10 minutes max). No troubles, i'll be sure to get stuff from China Wok in the future."}
{"text":"I'm on a quest to find a phoenix and dragon similar to my favorite Chinese place in Indy. This is the closet I've come, much to my disappointment. This restaurant keeps getting into my apartment building, despite the security doors. Today they just stuck them in the elevator. Which I thought was pretty neat compared to their normal door spamiming. Then I went down to the first floor and realized they also just scattered them all over the floor.

In my phoenix and dragon I had five \"jumbo\" shrimps. Which are really just average sized shrimp. The only thing I can think of is that they consider the mini shrimp some Chinese places have as normal. I guess compared to those the shrimp is jumbo. The \"spicy chicken\" is just general tso's. I got medium spice which was barely spicy at all. Most of my dish ended up being peas, carrots, and onions in a weird \"spicy\" sauce that wasn't very good.

I also got the rangoons. Some one else mentioned in this that they don't really have much crab. Which is an understatement. There's maybe a flick of crab in each. They're still fairly good, just not crab.

I suppose the worst part was delivery time. The confirmation email doesn't come with a estimated delivery. Whatever, my boyfriend and I expect 40 minutes like normal. 40 minute mark rolls around and we haven't gotten a call. Since our buzzer system isn't set up we were worried that they didn't see the note to call and were buzzing us. The person who answers says it's in the car and close. 20 minutes later we're still waiting. My boyfriend calls back and goes to give his info. The lady says, \"Oh, you just called. It's almost there,\" and that was it. Uhm. Ok. A little less than 10 minutes later and it arrives. The driver apologized and It was still hot. So there's that.

tl;dr small portions, not jumbo shrimp, not spicy, not very good, long wait, unfriendly staff on the phones, friendly drivers, and they litter my apartment building a lot."}
{"text":"I ordered from China Wok online, and after a half hour had gone by I called to get an update on the order status.  The woman on the phone was extremely rude, and said they don't deliver to where we are, 15 minutes away.  She asked if I could pick up the order instead, so I asked if it was ready, and she said no we didn't make it. I asked her why they didn't call to tell me the order wouldn't go through, and she just said again we don't deliver to you, too far. Rudeeee."}
{"text":"We love this place.  The owner is nice and they consistently have great food.  IMO they have the best General Tao's Chicken anywhere.  They even give free food when you spend $10, $20 or $30."}
{"text":"I live very nearby this restaurant, and when I moved into my apartment, I was so excited to have a Chinese place next door. I had high hopes, and they simply couldn't have fallen farther. I have ordered take out from here twice (well, they only have 1 table anyway), and it wins the award for worst Chinese food EVER. I had tofu mixed vegetables, which is my go-to. No. just no. The vegetables were not just mediocre quality, but clearly past their prime. I'm talking soggy, wilted, and literally, barely even edible. It was so bad, I couldn't even tolerate eating the rest of my meal. Again, in an attempt to force myself to like China Wok, I ordered from here a second, and final time, 2 weeks after. The food was still of poor quality.I had hoped it was an isolated incident, but the facts suggest otherwise. I am truly shocked there are so many positive reviews here.

In conclusion, poor quality food, questionable sanitation, very very limited seating. Please, China Wok, if you read this, take a look at what you're serving as Tofu Mixed Veggies, or it's only a matter of time before the health department will look for you!"}
{"text":"A friend first introduced me to this hole-in-the-wall Chinese food place, and is now one of my favorites! Egg drop soup and Garlic chicken are among my top choices. Clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"-A Bland Chicken Dinner-

Very average Chinese place. My girlfriend and I have been searching around for good Chinese places and this place was fairly close to where we now live.

I placed an order over the phone for General Tso's Chicken and Orange Chicken meals (which come with fried rice, an egg roll, and a fortune cookie). When placing the order, the woman on the phone seemed overly rushed, but she took my order and phone number. After receiving those, she hung up. I never said my name, and I never was given a time to come pick up my order.

I decided to just head from my place to China Wok and see if it was ready. On arrival, I know now why she seemed so rushed, she was practically working alone. She asked if I had ordered the General Tso and Orange Chicken, I said yes and was given a 5 minute wait time. I picked out a few drinks from their fridge, paid, and found a place to sit.

It wasn't long before my order was ready, service seemed more polite than it was over the phone. I left and brought the food back to my apartment.

My girlfriend and I opened our food, which was labeled so we could tell our orders apart, and gave it a try. The rice was phenomenal, the eggrolls were large, and the chicken was well sauced. The chicken was lacking in flavor as the General Tso's Chicken was not very spicy (dispite having hot peppers on the menu picture), and the Orange Chicken was not very sweet. 

Serving size was nice and filling, price was pretty standard for Chinese, service over the phone was not very good (but much better in person), plenty of sauce.

The only reason I wouldn't give it a 4 star rating would be because the chicken was not to my standard in flavor, and the service over the phone was pretty rough."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout from here tonight. Eh. It was just okay. I ordered the hot and sour soup, which was a bit thin and greasy but otherwise okay tasting. I also ordered the chicken and snow peas. In my experience, this dish is supposed to be chicken, snow peas, maybe a few carrot slices, and a clear-ish sauce. Instead it came drenched in a brown sauce and had a ton of carrots, mushrooms, and water chestnuts. Not what I expected, plus the snow peas were really overcooked and had no \"snap\" whatsoever. I probably won't be going back here. On the plus side, the prices are very good, and $10.74 bought enough food for two meals or more. The food was hot when I picked it up, and the cashier was cordial."}
{"text":"Felt like writing an update... I had not been for more then a year.. Had to run an errand and passing by it was the perfect time to remind myself how good this food is! It is more then good!!! I ordered the Spicy Kung Pao chicken... and let me tell you.. this dish packed some heat... and I who will always whine on how I like spicy...but can't eat it.. basically licked that box clean! So, so , so good.. Full of flavor. Best chinese food - hands down. The ladies in the shop were very nice as always. I only wish you were closer to work, or home or anywhere I felt like ordering Chinese!"}
{"text":"I never write a review but I have to for this place. This was the WORST food I've ever had, Lo mein had no flavor, noodles were over cooked a mushy. Crab Rangoon tasted horrible. Spring rolls were sloppy and nasty!!! Never again, I usually go to Golden Phoenix but I wanted to try something new. Lesson learned, stick with what you know!!!
Not to mention the delivery guy called me to go outside, to get my food because he was lost and couldn't get in the gate!!!
We only have 8 buildings and the gate is working fine!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love china wok. I know the previous owners personally and although things have changed a little since they sold, its still good Chinese food. I eat here once or twice a month."}
{"text":"The food was acceptable, Kung Pao sauce was not thick enough and the portions are small. I'd probably recommended Panda Express over this place."}
{"text":"Ordered this last Friday night. It was cheap, delicious, and literally only took like 15-20 minutes to get to us. I ordered the kung pao chicken and my boyfriend got the general tsos chicken. Both were good and had a good level of spiciness. I liked the egg rolls too, the combo is a good, cheap deal. Anyway, we'll be ordering from here again because it was sooo fast. I love that!"}
{"text":"Only one panpank with my order of eggfuu yoinh.  I tipped him via thr app but an now concideetation that goigs to groups ( also unfair) i will no east there again.  Plus no bua loads ever.  See a bud as any foos establishment and pass."}
{"text":"This place is normally spot on but my experience tonight left a bad taste in my mouth. 

I stopped by on my way home from work this evening to grab a quick meal for myself and my girlfriend. I order the chicken chow mien and she ordered the sesame chicken with added broccoli. Apparently this little request was far too much for them to handle as this would be the whole downfall of our experience. After a short wait I take the food home and prepare to enjoy our meal when we discover instead of my girlfriend's sesame chicken but kung pao chicken (strike 1). I call the restaurant to inform them of their mistake and ask if they would prepare the dish I had originally ordered. After placing my order and clearly stating that I would like sesame chicken with broccoli AGAIN, I asked if I needed to return the mistake order of kung pao chicken. I got no response but some yelling in another language I don't understand. So, I ask again. More yelling, no real response. I ask one more time and finally get a response of \"yeah yeah, you want Kung pao chicken or sesame chicken?\" So I state my order AGAIN hoping this time they'll get it right. After completing my order I hang up and wait to go back to the restaurant to pick up my second order. After not receiving a clear answer over the phone, I didn't bring the mistake order with me because, well, I already paid for it and figured they would simply throw it away anyways and I hoped that since they messed up my order that they would be gracious enough to replace my order free of charge being as I had to drive all the way back to the restaurant because of their mistake. When I arrived to pick up my order they told me I had to pay AGAIN because I didn't return the kung pao chicken. When I tried to explain how I was not told to return the previous meal all I was met with was more yelling into the back which I could not understand followed by a refusal to replace my meal without paying (even though it was their mistake). So I swallow my pride and pay for my meal a second time (Strike 2). I finally arrive home a 2nd time and as we finally sit down to enjoy our meal once again we open the container to find sesame chicken but no broccoli. That's the whole reason my girlfriend placed the order, that's the whole reason why I went back for a 2nd order, that's the reason why I decided to pay for my meal, twice. So, I call the restaurant a 2nd time to inform them they messed up my order, AGAIN. Am I met with an apologetic response??? Nope. More yelling in the background I can't understand and then I'm informed that it's my fault and apparently I never ordered the broccoli (even though my girlfriend clearly heard me request the order 3 times). STRIKE 3!!!

Poor form China Wok. Just such a disappointing experience all around."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to my hotel room since I was feeling under the weather and did not want to go out. Fast delivery but the food was not very good. The General Tso's was below average and the portion was really small compared to what I am used to. No sharing this plate. The pork fried rice was absent of any pork? Egg roll was soggy and fried wontons barely had any meat in them. I have had worse before, but not much worse."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much, but we were pleasantly surprised by China Wok. The house chicken and house fried rice were great - huge portions! The mongolian beef and eggrolls were just OK, but the egg flower soup was fresh and tasty. The best part? Delivery was SUPER fast."}
{"text":"We order from here a couple of times a month and the food is always great.  The people are nice, our delivery driver is wonderful and always remembers us.  They have the best crab angels I have had in the area, I would defiantly recommend them for take out and you can't beat their prices!"}
{"text":"Okay for a quick meal if you're starving but their won ton soup is terrible. The broth tastes like cabbage flavored dishwater and the won tons had nothing in them, literally just balls of dough - disgusting and inedible. We've been going there and the quality has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Standard midwest Chinese food, fast delivery, good prices, and absolutely the best steamed dumplings in town (and I've tried most of them). They're twice the size of the dumplings anywhere else in town and have a nice bite of ginger. Honestly one whole star is for those - otherwise it's decent utility Chinese and I have no complaints, after 2 years of pretty routine ordering."}
{"text":"I'm going to purely rate this experience on the sushi order I placed. I'll be happy to return and update my review as I try other items.  I was brought here by co-workers who frequent often. Each of them placed their order from the menu while I opted for the Sushi Lunch Special consisting of 5 pieces of sushi and a California roll. That along with a drink was $12 and some change. Please keep in mind this was around 12:30p so the lunch hour. While each of my co-workers received their food and appetizer, I continued to wait for my lunch special. I had assumed since it was a lunch special that it was readily available. I was wrong. About 10 minutes after my friends had begun to eat ( which hey felt awkward doing in front of me with no food but I insisted) my dish finally arrived. The presentation was great and I must say the Sushi was fairly good. You could tell it was a rush job because the sticky rice wasn't holding very well and crumbled a lot. This certainly wasn't the best Sushi I've ever had but far from the worst and it is nice to know I have a place within walking distance from work. I was disappointed in the timing but over all pleased with the end result. I look forward to trying some of their specialty rolls which are buy one get one 1/2 off along with their more traditional dishes.  I'm sure this will become a regular stop as long as small improvements are made."}
{"text":"Decent. Though their fried rice is bit underwhelming. Can't beat the price for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"Overall an average stop. The place looked clean, was well lit and the staff was very nice. 

Then portion of my meal was large enough for 2 people. There was so much chicken and about 10 pieces of broccoli. So if you like leftovers or can eat enormous amounts of food give it a shot. 

The fried rice was bland. This is one of my favorite parts of the meal and this was a let down. No egg, carrot, etc...  Just rice. Egg roll was average as well. 

If you're in the mood for Chinese and are nearby, stop in. Don't go too far to try it out though. They have indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Best Chinese take out we've had in a long time!! Not too greasy and all the food we order is very flavorful."}
{"text":"For the most part, take-out Chinese restaurants are fairly indistinguishable, and, in terms of menu offerings, China Wok is on par with what you find at most other places. That being, said the quality of the food is certainly a notch above where your expectations could reasonably be set. I have been here on numerous occasions and have sampled much of the menu, so for the purposes of this review I will concentrate on some of the standouts. 

The fried rice is amazing. I mean, truly and seriously amazing. Each bite is full of soft, pillowy rice and lots of vegetables (with the veggie fried rice) or chicken (with the chicken fried rice). I could eat this dish every day the rest of my life and still crave it the next morning. They have the standard array of soups, and all are pretty decent. They are served way too hot (must be heated up in the microwave), so just keep that in mind. The chicken lo mein and sesame chicken are both excellent, but the sesame chicken is only served as a full dinner. There are other dishes (such as General Tso's chicken) that are offered in the same manner. That's disappointing because what's better than sampling multiple Chinese dishes, right? The sweet & sour offerings are the only thing I've tried that I'd recommend avoiding. It's not that it's bad, per se, but it's just boring. Chunks of deep fried chicken served with a side of tangy sauce isn't the worst thing in the world, but it's not that different than what you can get absolutely anywhere. Not worth the grease and fat. 

One of the things that draws me to this place in the cleanliness of the restaurant. It's absolutely immaculate. The service is also very friendly. It's a family affair at China Wok with a man and a woman and two little kids always working. The little boy is always funny and friendly. He generally will talk to you as he sweeps the dining room as you wait on your food. 

Overall, if you live in the area and are in the mood for Chinese, don't hesitate to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Family went here before a concert at PPG Arena. The staff here are great and modified food based on our tastes. We had 6 of us and all were so happy with the taste and quantity of the yummy food. The check was less than $40 and the taste very authentic. We love Chinese food and this place is too on our list. They made my wife's dish gluten free which was nice of them."}
{"text":"Recommend, ordered delivery from here when I was working late and the food was great.  Had orange chicken, egg foo young, egg rolls, and white and brown rice."}
{"text":"It's good Chinese delivery.  Not the highest quality of food, but you certainly get the value of what you're paying for.  I don't think it's a place I would ever consider dining in at, but when you don't feel like the leaving the house, it's a pizza alternative.

Last night we ordered Moo Goo Gai Pan.  It was average.  All though it was big and loaded with chicken, veggies, and white sauce, it was nothing I had to keep eating after having a little less than half the box.  We also had the Chicken Chow Fun.  It was good, but as much has I like that dish, I think Chow Fun tastes the same no matter where you order it.  Nothing was bad, but it's all standard Chinese Delivery/take out."}
{"text":"You know how you see a picture of food at a restaurant, you order it, only to have what is put on your plate barely resemble what you saw in the picture?  Well, you don't have to worry about this at China Wok.  What you get as your meal looks even better than the pictures above their counter.

I've dined at this carry out Chinese location numerous times over the past 2 years.  My office is only a mile or so away and it makes for a quick meal.  I must say, I feel like something has changed in the past year.  When I used to go, I felt like no matter what I ordered, it all looked/tasted the same. (ie sauce, color, vegetables, etc)  But for the past year or so, my coworker and I marvel at how great the food looks when it comes from the kitchen.  We primarily dine in.  We're practically giving each other high-fives, because we feel like we just scored big.

And the flavor is just as good as it looks.  I just ate at another carryout Chinese location and the quality of food reminded me how great China Wok is, so I jumped out to right this review.

I regularly get Kung Pao Chicken or Mongolian Beef.  My coworker exclusively gets General Tso's Chicken (this thing always looks amazing!)

Value is always great...we can get both of our lunches, i usually add an egg roll (75 cents) and he usually gets a soda and it costs us around $12 for both of us.  Quantity of food is also great.

As you can tell, I highly recommend this place.  Given it's a carryout Chinese place, I really should give it 5 stars for overcoming such an obstacle!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about the service and hospitality we receive every time we order here.  Which makes their amazing food, taste that much better.  The folks here deliver to us and always bring us free Pepsi if our order is over a certain amount without being reminded or having to ask. We frequently get the shrimp chips, General Tso's, and the lo main is always a good choice."}
{"text":"Thank you Doubletree hotel for this great recommendation :(    The only good part is that they delivered in under 30 minutes.  It is located across from Fridays at the Consol arena.  

Wonton soup had undercooked noodles.  Cream Cheese puffs were just bad!  Pork Fried rice was lightly brown in color and didn't have much flavor.  The pork ribs were OK and the happy family main dish was a ripoff.  There were no Scallops or Lobster meat.  There were a few giant shrimp and much sliced pork.  The beef and chicken were of very poor quality.  It did come with broccoli and carrots.  The sauce was very  bland.  

Unfortunately there was only 1 prior review on Yelp.  Mine makes 2.  Prices were very reasonable and now I can see why."}
{"text":"We had some egg rolls, Chicken Chow Mein and General Tso's dinners.  The chicken chow mein came in a small and large size option which was nice.  We were ordering late after a Pirates game.
The food was average, but good.  However, i gave them a 4th star because we didnt get to order until 1045 pm.  They close at 11... but they delivered to our hotel anyway.  We got it around 1120 pm and it was VERY hot still.  
We would get it again."}
{"text":"Good Chinese at an affordable price. They have the best lunch combos and the food is usually ready for pickup in 10 minutes. My food is always hot and have yet had any complaints with consistency.  Not the best Chinese out there but for the price it's pretty solid!"}
{"text":"China Wok is my go-to delivery place for basic Chinese. 

When I just want some moderately priced food that will get here fast, fill my belly with warm and comforting Asiatic foodstuffs, this is who I turn to. I can't speak for its authenticity or service, but I can speak for how often I find myself hungry, cold, and ordering from China Wok's online delivery system. 

I don't generally care for Sweet & Sour anything. That's not real food!  Have you seen that toxic-waste colored, gelatinous red sauce?  That can't be good for you.  But on a friend's recommendation, I tried it from China Wok. It's delicious. Somehow the battered and fried chicken had not become soggy during delivery, and I found it was insanely addictive over pork fried rice. (I like their fried rice- not too greasy. But it seems to turn bitter when you re-heat it the next day.)

Decent dumplings, and my BF seems to enjoy the spare ribs, since those are the only two things he ever orders from there. The sauce that comes with those dumplings is pretty awesome I must say. I also enjoy the crab rangoons, though they are the very creamy kind with almost no actual crab meat. Ask me if I care. Because I don't. 

Really, I've probably had 75% of the menu by now, and nothing really sticks out as \"not good.\"  Though once we tried the Teriyaki Chicken and found it to be pretty dry. Who knows if that is how it usually is, since we only tried it once. What business did we have ordering Japanese food from a Chinese place anyway?

They are reliable, fairly priced, good size portions, hot when it arrives, completely non-threatening Chinese. If I wanted authentic Chinese cuisine, I'd be going somewhere for dine-in, not carry out.  China Wok delivers, and makes my insides happy."}
{"text":"There isn't a lot of selection here. I ended up getting the usual General Tao chicken and it was... meh. It wasn't bad.. much much better than the other crap I got from Thai Express the other day so I guess I wasn't expecting much. Nice service though. I always give higher marks for a nice smile."}
{"text":"Growing up my parents had a Chinese Resteraunt so every time I eat at one I am always comparing. I ordered the beef fried rice and and egg roll they were good. I would go here again out of convenience but not if I wanted any authentic Asian dishes."}
{"text":"Baby roach in the Shrimp with Lobster sauce. Delivered to my company for a lunch meeting. We all ended up throwing everything away. Too bad, cause they're fast and friendly and of all the times we ordered, this was the FIRST time we ever had an issue. 

It is in an old building, but these days, they should just be more vigilant in making sure their restaurant is \"food' ready....."}
{"text":"I have tried several entrees and a wide array of the appetizers here and I would rate all of them a 2 or 3 out of 5. 

My main complaint is that the chicken in all of my dishes,(orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, general tso's chicken, etc) has been rubbery, and often overcooked to the point of being hard and gross. 

If you want cheap chinese delivery that is edible, then I guess this place will do, but if you want your food to actually be better than \"meh\" I wouldn't reccommend it."}
{"text":"WASTED MY MONEY.....and Im big mad about it. The rice had no flavor, it was EXTRA greasy, and just bad all around. I would give 0 stars if possible, the best thing about the experience is that I learned to not go back."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special Pepper Beef it was $6.50, can't beat the price for what you get. The Beef and Pepper where super fresh and delicious. Fried rice was a little bland but I just mixed with black bean sauce and it was super. To top all this off from time I ordered I had food at my table in about 5 minutes, I felt as if I preordered."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Asian restaurant is good when other Asians patronize the place. The food isn't over \"soy sauced\", over salted like most other American Chinese restaurant. General Tso chicken is the poster child for bad American Chinese food. I tired it from here and it made me start rethinking. My friends love it too"}
{"text":"This place offer great food at a great price. The speed of the service is not too slow and not too fast. It is acceptable timing given the quality of the food you receive and pay for. 

The only cons to this place is that their accents make be very hard to understand them and god forbid you call to ask for a manager. If you're not placing an order do not call them. They will bluntly be short and rude letting you know the phone is only for placing orders. 

In conclusion, I would have to say a good place to great great food and overall good service."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place for the first time. I ordered the beef and broccoli and it was amazing! My husband ordered the orange chicken and he ate it all (that in itself was amazing). 
We also ordered the jalapeño shrimp and we both really enjoyed it! 
I would definitely recommend china wok and I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Partner has gotten food poisoning twice from this location and I have once. Yesterday, she had the shrimp with lobster sauce, pork fried rice and an egg roll. One hour later, she came home with severe stomach cramps, got the shakes, and a fever. It lasted 12 hours. Classic food poisoning signs. Poor baby! The last time she got sick from there it was the other end. I have reported them myself last year. Partner reported this incident. Something is up with the Fordem Ave. place. Beware! And so very sorry for writing this but sometimes you just gotta."}
{"text":"The food is good but delivery not so good . Took over an hour and the excuse was location. Sure hope they get better otherwise taking my business elsewhere ."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!  The worst Chinese food ever!  Dumpling were raw, the beef dish had little to no beef, the fried rice was yellow and flavorless. Called to complain and was told too bad! I wouldn't go back if I was paid to eat her! OMG"}
{"text":"Brentwood needed a GOOD Chinese food restaurant. China Wok moved in and was having a Grand Opening so we gave it a try. There are 3 or 4 small tables to sit at and eat. I ordered food for take out. My food was made hot and fresh and packed nicely for travel. 
I ordered the Sesame Chicken. They make theirs with a lot of heat. I asked for little to no heat. It had a smidge of heat and it was good. The chicken was cut into smaller pieces but it actually made it easier to eat. There was a very small amount of breading but not enough that it was heavy or clunky. Their portion size was I keeping with other restaurants. It was served with fried rice which had some bean sprouts and bits of pork in it. The sprouts were a nice little crunch and the pork added a little flavor to the rice. An egg roll came with my meal. It was on the smaller side but like the chicken it made it easier to eat. The egg roll was cooked perfectly and had a crispy outside and the insides were cooked perfectly. 
We will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Last 3 times Ive been there I've asked to make my chicken extra spicy. I literally say \"make it so spicy it hurts.\" or \"the spiciest you can possibly make it.\" it has never been spicy. I don't know if they just don't listen, care, or understand? 

Anyway, standard pretty average Midwest Chinese. Too expensive."}
{"text":"China Wok is your typical Chinese take-out spot; even when you dine in, everything is served in to-go containers.  Seems like most things are cooked fresh here since food is served piping hot!  Always a plus, especially compared to Panda Express.  The food here is decent, and the lunch specials are a good reason to stop by if you're in the area: $5.95 from 11:00am to 4:00pm, with many options to choose from.  It's nothing spectacular, but it is definitely A-OK for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place. It took them about 40 min to deliver, which I think is a standard. Well, the food was alright - didn't wow me and my friend, but we didn't complain about it either.

I liked the fact that they serve not overly greasy chinese. We ordered pork chop suey, mixed vegetable, and beef with snow peas. All of them tasted  good without making my guts feel nauseous. 

One thing my friend and I didn't know - so in Midwest (or in Madison only?) \"chow mein\" is not a noodle dish .... .  So make sure to order \"Lo mein\" if you want that noodle dish. Chow mein is chop suey. I swear it's not like that in California!"}
{"text":"This is one of the WORST Chinese food i EVER had in my life. I ordered Szechuan chicken, the color was PINK and watery with some strange vegetable i could not recognize. Didn't taste anything like szechuan chicken.Shrimp fried rice had plain yellow rice with only tiny shrimps (  no carrot,bean sprouts,onion,peas etc). Lastly, I ordered chicken wings.  i saw they put raw FROZEN chicken wings into deep frier. Within 5 minutes wings were ready. Apparently, wings were undercooked and bloody. I took a bite only and how to throw out. Price was ok but was not cheap.

I believe owner is putting up other reviews other than Chris M. The lady at the front register was rude. She asked .50 for hot sauce!! So overall, food was ABSOLUTELY terrible and service was just poor. I would not mind the service if food was good."}
{"text":"I always order their shrimp egg foo young . Which is amazing by the way, and you get more then enough for the price ! !!! But this time I decided to get  my food delivered . Which there is a $15 minimal . So I added chicken wings to my order , and I wasn't expecting them to be like this ! They're amazing ! You can tell some type of sauce or something was added to them when they were fried !! I will definitely be ordering them again !"}
{"text":"It was just fine for delivery. It took them almost an hour to deliver but they were courteous and helpful on the phone. 

The food was just fine. I ordered the large chicken and broccoli (it comes with white meat) and asked if that came with rice. Well it does, but only a tiny pint. 

The egg drop soup was sub-standard.

Just moved to Phoenix and will probably keep looking for other chinese delivery places."}
{"text":"Hubby and I love this place.  We've had Chinese food all over the country, including Chinatown in San Francisco, and we think the food here is just great.  The sauces are so delicious, the veggies are crisp, they put a ton of shrimp in their dishes, and the meats are good quality (some buffets have really fatty, tough meat).  If you want the buffet, you need to be here between 11:30 and 1:30 when dishes are hot and fresh. They have additional dishes at the dinner buffet, but we think lunch is the best deal.  Hope this place never changes."}
{"text":"China wok is a little mom and pop shop having all your basic Asian fusion inspired Chinese food that you expect it to be. Small and homey dining area, they have fountain drinks as well as bottled drinks. Quick and easy order if you don't want to go to a typical Panda Express come here! Better food and home feeling."}
{"text":"i liked this place, i lived over close to scottsdale road for over 3 years and always occasionally had lunch here and also did dinner a few times when i was on the go i would totally return here if i lived in that area still awesome place"}
{"text":"Overall this place wasn't anything amazing. The food was just alright. The Lunch specials are very reasonably priced so that is nice. Food is also done very fast. 

I ordered the Hot & Spicy Chicken lunch special and it was alright. For supposedly being \"hot\" it was not to me. I do always try and keep in mind though that I prefer things spicier than the average person does. There were a lot of onions in the dish and the vegetable were still a little to raw for me. 

Them main thing that concerned me was about and hour after eating my lunch my stomach started to hurt. I have a sensitive stomach to greasy foods. If you do not it probably is not a problem but for me it can really be a pain."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! Probably the best Chinese food I've had. I love that all the ingredients are always fresh and taste great. Delivery is really quick too"}
{"text":"This place is great!  My husband and I ordered the other night and were pleasantly surprised!  Great food, great pricing and quick, friendly delivery.  I will note that the gentleman on the phone was pleasant and spoke English very well - we have had some issues in the past with communication break-downs so this was totally a bonus."}
{"text":"We decided not to order from Malee's because we wanted something a bit cheaper. God, that was a mistake.

I ordered the spicy chicken combo. I asked for noodles instead of rice. Crazy.. I know.

Pick up the food, take it home, open the container, get immediately pissed off. 

They didn't mix the noodles with the chicken and sauce and the noodles were so overcooked they might as well have been liquified. And I swear to God, they were spaghetti noodles.

(white people problems.. Yeah yeah yeah)

I was so grossed out and annoyed that I didn't eat any of it. I hopped in the car and went straight to Malee's where they know how to cook noodles. 

My boyfriend ended up eating the nasty, pathetic overcooked bland noodles the next day and he wasn't too thrilled with it either. And I quote \"it's just something to eat\".

Ps. They have a fish tank stuffed with two HUGE koi that hardly have any room to turn around. Is that the fish special? Or do they just enjoy animal cruelty. 

NEVER GOING BACK."}
{"text":"China Wok is my favorite go-to for fast Chinese food. They have the hands down best chicken egg foo young in Vegas, the seafood dishes taste fresh and delicious, and even offer off the menu items when you can't decide on a dish. Cheap, fast and welcoming. Cannot recommend enough."}
{"text":"I should of read the reviews before I decided to try this place, thankfully it was the \"lunch\" special.. Please first know that I have eaten my fair share of chinese of this price/caliber  yet this place is the first to be inedible so two Lunch specials rot in my trash as I type..

My son is obsessed with chinese food especially broccoli chicken.. He prefers this one place that's a bit far and I was driving by the new \"smiths\" and saw chinese and decided to give it a try..

We got the lunch specials with fried rice for 5.95 each ...  Chicken Lo Mein and Chicken Broccoli... The Lo Mein was OK but the chicken in both dishes weren't good.. The fried rice is pretty funky but worst of all the chicken and broccoli was like gelatin .. I don't know any better way to say that it was gross!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Moo GOO Gai Pan, Beef and peppers, Sweet and sour chicken and AUTHENTIC NY CHICKEN CHOW MEIN........... Boy, all of ii was good!, TASTY!!!!!! really great chicken chow mein and the Beef and Peppers had lots of beef.I've been going to this place for about 5 years ...never had a bad meal....... I'LL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Fast, tasty and affordable. It's clean and their specials are great, I like the egg rolls and their honey garlic sauce it delish. Go check them out!"}
{"text":"The food's not too bad for a little Chinese takeout place.  

My only complaint is that they're extremely stingy with their sauce packets, and the staff doesn't seem to appreciate it when you ask for more."}
{"text":"I typically hate and do not recommend Chinese buffets, but this is totally the exception. I have been going to this buffet for a few years now, and it is great every time.  They don't overstock the buffet, so they keep the items fresh all the time.  From the soups, to apps to the main dishes, is very good food.  Remember, its Chinese, so stay away from the sushi, its not up to par with the rest of the buffet.  Finally, there is ice cream kind of hidden in the back.   Put a scoop or two on top of a hot doughunt or two and you will finish in heaven."}
{"text":"I came here the other night with my boyfriend for some late night Chinese food. It was just your typical take out Chinese, nothing special. I got the beef with vegetables combo and egg drop soup. I liked the soup, but felt there was too much sauce with the meat. It was a bit pricey for mediocre Chinese, but they give really big portions. I will probably be back if I had a late night craving, but I'm not DYING to go back."}
{"text":"This place is consistantly amazing! Im not a big chinese fan, but my family is. We get the mongolian chicken, (which is amazing) and the beef with garlic sauce, (so good) and the general tso chicken! We also get the crab rangoons, house fried rice, and the singapore moodlea! This place is amazing! Great familu owned business."}
{"text":"That place smells like grease and they don't have sweet and sour sauce?!? I wouldn't recommend this place. I would never sit inside there to eat so why would I want to order food from there."}
{"text":"For take out this place is a 10...quick and priced well

I have never eaten inside and there were 0 people when I arrived - but its Chinese food, you're supposed to do take out."}
{"text":"I need to give these guys another star solely based on the fact that I've been there 3 times this month. And while I hold my ground that it isn't he best in town, the staff is incredible... so sweet! And if you miss their crazy 5-$7 lunch specials 11-3, that's ok, because dinner specials start at $8 or so. Again, I've had better in town, but for fast, like lightening fast take-out, it's fit the bill on some colder nights when I didn't feel like leaving the couch to cook."}
{"text":"Well, they're nothing super special, but one simply doesn't expect \"super special,\" from Asian takeout restaurants. I ordered online with the yelp app, the food came eight minutes sooner than the estimate, it was quite tasty, and I was surprised at how much pork was in the \"roasted pork with Chinese vegetables.\"  They certainly did not stint me on the most valuable component.  The pork eggrolls were kind of small, but crispy and tasty. I wish I had remembered to ask for a hot and spicy mustard to go with them. Automatically included were duck sauce and soy sauce.  You definitely get fair value for price paid. Especially note that their delivery charge is only $1, while the other two restaurants I looked at charged $3.99, and $4.99. I think that's outrageous."}
{"text":"The noodles were literally swimming in oil (in the little take out box, after all the noodles, vegetables and chicken were out, it was literally JUST oil and sauce filling up a third of the box...). Not to mention, the food had no real flavor. The egg rolls, the lo mein... They had the texture and smell of Chinese food... But the taste was very VERY bland. And the chicken in the lo mein dish was dry and felt way too much like rubber... Tasted like rubber too. I haven't tried much else from here but I don't plan to."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for Chinese so I decided to give this place a try,and I'm glad I did!! Got the Governor Chicken and it was amazing!! My daughter got the Chicken mei fun and it was fantastic!! I will definitely be returning when I need my Chinese food fix"}
{"text":"My only Chinese spot I go to for takeout. I'm obsessed with there crab angels with sauce but you must try the House Chicken (recommend extra spicy) Ala Cart. It comes with rice stick noodles and a side of white rice but obviously the best part is the panko deep fried chicken in the fabulous spicy honey sauce - Its honestly to die for! Delivery is extremely quick too - about 30/40 minutes tops. Pickup orders are even faster! Won't try anywhere else for Chinese food especially since good Chinese in the valley is almost impossible to find until this place. So don't let the run-down look scare you, I swear its just apart of the charm! If only they had scallion pancakes (Chinese pizza) because i'd eat here everyday."}
{"text":"We came here prior to watching WWE Monday Night Raw live at the Consol Energy Center, and I didn't find it lousy at all. Our dinner at China Wok was very solid Chinese fare to me, and I'm glad we chanced upon the place as we walked down 5th Avenue towards the arena. 

I randomly ordered the Chicken Wings and Fried Rice and am happy to report that the wings, drumette and flat left connected, were a smash with their brittle skin and supple, unctuous, briny meat. Never did I think that some of the greatest chicken wings ever could be found at a Chinese restaurant. 

The bed of fried rice was but an afterthought but served its purpose. 

Steamed dumplings. What restaurant falters at these? China Wok certainly does not. The potsticker was soft, the meat inside was dense and peppered with bits of onion, and overall, I was reminded of why I always want to order these easy Asian crowd pleasers. 

Kay had something with shrimp and langostinos in it, and I snatched up the chunks of properly cooked seafood anxiously when she decided she couldn't finish her dinner.

A triad of China Wok's almond cookies can be had for just 60 cents, but their chewiness and mild sweetness makes them worth 6 dollars. 

I hate to say that there were no rip-offs nor was there any blandness on our end save for the fried rice. The service was good, the food was mostly above average...sorry. 

Mine makes...3! 

Yay?

P.S. Considering concession stand prices, my wallet was relieved by China Wok's criminal affordability, and again, quality food. To think that we almost hit the new TGI Friday's nearby."}
{"text":"Last time, they use char siu for pork with garlic sauce. This time, there's a staple in my shrimp with lobster sauce. I do not understand. Why will someone replace pork with char siu? Why will there be a staple in my dish? That didn't make sense. Who will have staple in kitchen???"}
{"text":"This is probably the best tasting and fastest Chinese food delivery available in old town Scottsdale. The portions are big, so split one dinner and one appetizer and you're all set. The house fried rice was a little dry but flavorful, egg drop soup is packed with goodness (not just broth), the pot stickers are freaking amazing, egg rolls are very good too with extra hot mustard. *Lunch specials are the way to go before 3pm."}
{"text":"We really like China Wok at our office.  We like it because they are careful taking orders; friendly, the prices are very reasonable, and they deliver right to our office, and usually much more quickly than they estimate.  The food is really tasty and delicious.  The lunch specials are a particularly good value they include either a pop or spring rolls, rice and your pick of meals.  I like the beef and broccoli  with double-beef."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. The food was just the worst. They have a HUGE KOI fish in a tank with other large fish and the poor thing can't even turn around. FIND THAT FISH AN APPROPRIATE HOME!!! Don't go here people.. Between the AWFUL food and animal abuse, skip it! My search for good Chinese food continues."}
{"text":"Your typical basic Chinese food in south Scottsdale for when ur hungover or feeling like a fatty. Me and my roomies get delivery here once or twice a month and the food is always hot, fresh, and quick. I think their crab puffs and egg rolls are above average to most Chinese restaurants. If you like spicy foods my go to is the spicy chicken or spicy beef because it's 'healthier' and flavorful (minus the sodium)"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on GrubHub and decided to have some food delivered. I ordered the crab puffs ragoon thingy s, some beef with broccoli, and king pao chicken. I felt that for the amount I spent the portion sizes were small and not as tasty as many other cheaper options. The crab puffs were overcooked in my opinion. The rest of the food did not interest my taste buds. The delivery man was very nice which I always appreciate. Sadly, I do not think I will order from here again. Nothing stuck out to me for the amount I spent."}
{"text":"Understand this is a traditional style take out joint. This is not the go sit down hibachi style restaurant. If you want some Chinese takeout in Westlake, this is by far your best option. 

The food is exactly what you expect from Chinese takeout. The service is above average for these types of establishments. The food is a solid three but when you couple that with an always pleasant takeout experience, you get four stars from me. 

Additionally, I have never had my order messed up here."}
{"text":"Yummy Chinese food that is not too greasy like alot of fast/delivery type places. Dinner combos are good.portions that aren't overly  stuffed into the plate giving you food coma after. They come with choice of rice (2 scoops ) , 2 deliciously crunchy Rangoon's and a large and in charge eggroll that's chewy soft inside and good none grease filled crunch outside. I chose the 3 king delight which recommend if can't chose great clean meat cuts of steals chicken and shrimp (devined too thankfully) and nicely cooked soft with slight cru check veggies that you can tell that not just been sitting and in sauce prepared and getting soggy and rubbery. This is fresh well rounded light yet confort food approved Chinese takeout/delivery! 
Ps: The hot n sour soup is best  !!!"}
{"text":"I made a large order for my office team and like some of the other comments the food was just okay. I asked for fried rice with my meal, I got white rice. The hot & sour soup does not taste like a hot and sour soup (very bland if you can believe that), it looked almost like a wonton soup. I think we will try some other places next time."}
{"text":"Chinese delivery for North Olmsted/Westlake that tastes fantastic and is clean!  My brother always gets the Kung Pao chicken that he claims is like no where else and I get General Tso's tofu.  Great prices for a lot of food!
The lady who normally answers the phone will remember you on your second order, so nice!!!!"}
{"text":"I live like a short distance away from here, and have been here many times! Although I'm not Chinese, I think there food is pretty good even though I almost always order the same thing every time. Now to the downside, the staff first of all is VERY rude. The cashier barely answered any of my questions about the food, and didn't even look like he gave a crap. This restaurant really needs to work on their costumer service big time, and from what I heard their delivery too! Also the food is really overpriced for just a small bowl of fried rice."}
{"text":"We were here for the RHCP concert and this little place popped up. Not your average Chinese. We were impressed with the way the food was decorated on our plates and how convenient it was to the arena. They served the food quick and it was piping hot. Thanks a lot!"}
{"text":"Speedy quick delivery. Able to order completely on the iPad. Good Chinese comfort food for a sick patient in the hospital."}
{"text":"While I will admit that I can sometimes be overly picky when it comes to chinese food, this place was AWFUL!  I ordered Orange Chicken, expecting a dark glazed piece of fried chicken with a spicy bite at the end, and what I received were fried chicken pieces with orange juice poured on top.  

I was told this was by far the best chinese food in Phoenix, and I couldn't disagree more.  Take my advice - go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I was surprised how good this place was. I happened to be in the area and was feeling Chinese so I decided to give it a shot. Everyone I was with loved their food and we all plan on going back. I tried their lemon chicken and chicken fried rice... Delicious! I'd recommend this place if you feel like Chinese and are in the area definitely try it."}
{"text":"Me and my family were in the area and got a taste for chinese...this one popped up.  We were not disappointed.  Delicious and flavorful! Next time were in the area we will be back. Prices were awesome as well!"}
{"text":"New York Style Chinese food!  Now most people don't really know what this means.  everything I searched on the internet is wrong.  So a REAL NEW YORKER who actually speaks to the Asian owners and cooks. Its not the \"American or Western\" style its the Province from where That particular Family came from. On the west coast  you get Cantonese Chinese Cooking. ( I found San Francsico) But in NEW YORK we have mainly  Saskatchewan Style cooking which is vastly different in taste. Now When we say EGG roll that are large not Small Spring roll the size of your pinky. We mean large size roll. 
Now when your in China Town in NYC (Lafayette st, Canal St, Centre St.) that is more Authentic They Serve you family style with Large round table, its usually a 3-5 course dinner. (the service is excellent and the food is not greasy. ) Im sure there is some added flavors that Us American like on certain dishes but for the most part it way better that the Corner spots. Every New Yorker i met all say the same thing.. Why does the chinese taste horrible here. I thought it was me, I Even asked a few Chinese friends i have here and they suggested heading to China town area on Sprint Mtn ave. So i Go There and its the same. Now the Only Place i found where its New York Style food is China-A- Go-Go.  Now  FYI  Know your noodles, they do not make \"Lo-Mein\" Noodles that we are used to on the east coast."}
{"text":"I've had the worst experience with China Wok and I refuse to recommend it to any friends. 

The food I received from China Wok was dry and tasteless. I ordered the vegetable Lo mein with egg rolls. It arrived room temperature. 

In addition, the delivery man left menus strewn about the lobby of our apartment complex. It was unprofessional and annoying to other residents of our building. 

I won't order from here again, ever."}
{"text":"I love the Veggie Moo Shu!!   This is our regular go to for take out night !! Its tasty, convenient location.  Good price and more than enough quantity of food in each order!  Great take out place they do have eat in space too!  Have always got our orders correct!  It kind of fun watching them cook the orders from the counter you can see the kitchen.  This works for me."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Customer service too. I was a little disappointed that the fried wontons were just chips. They usually have meat in them, but I still at them all. Sesame chicken and kungpao shrimp were awesome. Huge servings!!"}
{"text":"This place is expensive and food is not that good, and portions are small.  If you want great Chinese food for low price with big portions try China King at north ridgeville."}
{"text":"I ordered from China Wok for the first time last night, and was very happy with my meal. I'm now a vegetarian, and initially, was slightly depressed by their teeny tiny vegetarian menu. But as it turns out, they're more than happy to substitute meat in most of their entrees for tofu. I ordered the Yu Shang Chicken (with tofu instead of chicken) and it was delicious. Had the right amount of spice, lots of flavor and lots of veggies. It came as a combo with rice, fried wontons and an egg roll. Sadly, they don't have any veggie spring rolls, so I missed out on my tiny fried delight, but was very pleased with the rest of my meal, so I let it slide."}
{"text":"China Wok...You're like a good friend I can always count on! I get delivery from here usually once a week, or whenever I'm feeling down in the dumps. Yes, the food isn't amazing or super authentic, but it's really tasty. And affordable. AND- what's really important- the food is always piping hot when it's delivered! I usually get the broccoli beef, house spicy chicken or sesame chicken, and either the hot and sour soup or egg drop. It's all good!"}
{"text":"i love there food they have the best orange chickin ever and the lady is allways supper nice"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery for the first time here tonight. Placing an order was a breeze, the employee spoke perfect English. They quoted me 30-45 minutes but showed up in 25. Oddly enough I enjoyed everything about the meal except the actual entree. My hot and sour soup was very good and the egg roll and various fried wontons included were also quite good. I loved that they gave you an actual cup of sweet and sour sauce for dipping rather than just the little packets. I ordered the house spicy chicken and I didn't love it. There wasn't anything wrong with it per se but I just don't think I cared for it that much. It didn't seem much like an Asian inspired dish. The chicken itself was all white meat and of high quality so I am looking forward to ordering again but trying a different chicken dish. The fried rice was very forgettable, I will stick with steamed rice in the future. I've tried nearly all the Chinese delivery places in the area and this one is by far the best. I've found my new go-to Chinese delivery place."}
{"text":"I guess there's a reason why I haven't been here in a few years... Place is dirty, food is blah and service sucks. Go to the grocery store and buy yourself a frozen Chinese entrée you'll be more happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in their service.  Today they dropped off a menu on the front of everyone's door in my apartment building stating they delivered until 9.  It sounded good so I called and ordered $10 worth of food, which took way longer than it should have, and when I was finished they told me it had to be at least $15.  NOOO where on the menus they dropped does it say that.  

Terrible business practices..."}
{"text":"I wasn't surprized, I was shocked.  Forget the Egg Foo Young!

I've ordered from China Wok a couple of times before, and was never impressed.  I should have given it up!  I just received a delivery order from them and essentially wasted my money.  To give them credit, the food arrived more quickly than the 45-60 minute widow they indicated, and was piping hot.  The Egg Foo Young however was the WORST I have ever tasted.

Now, I am not a food snob, but I have been eating Egg Foo Young since my childhood, and eaten it at many places as well as prepared at home.  I've had it good, I've had it greasy, and I've had it soggy, but I've never had anything even remotely resembling what I got today.  

I opened the box and based on what I beheld, thought I'd received the wrong meal.  The egg foo young patties themselves, at first glance, looked like uniformly round batter fried eggplant slices.  I cut, with difficulty, into one of the patties (it was tough) and the inside looked like a meat patty - nothing egg colored or even remotely yellow about it.  The color was like a well done hamburger - gray.  I tasted it and it certainly didn't tase like Egg Foo Young, nor did it taste good.  It was like a bite of a dense veggie patty.  Awful.  I checked all three patties and they were the same, and inedible as far as I was concerned.

So on the chance that they had sent me the wrong order, I called the restaurant and told them I thought I had the wrong order.  She verified that the right thing had been sent.  I said \"but this seems like a tough meat pattie of some sort.  I've never seen Egg Foo Young like this.\"  Her response was \"that is how we prepare Egg Foo Young\".

So, word of warning - that is how they prepare Egg Foo Young.  Order something else, or just stay away completely.  In my experiences with Cina Wok, you can never be quite sure what you are going to get.  This was just bad enough that I HAD to write a review.  I wish there were zero stars."}
{"text":"Ive been ordering delivery from these folks for years. Its always fast and delicious. Today we got the crab puffs which were creamy and hot. The Mongolian beef was in a tasty brown gravy-like sauce with plenty of veggies. The meat was tender but they kinda skimped on the portion. I had the lemon chicken. It was breaded chicken pieces in an awesome lemony sauce with carrots and crunchy water chestnuts. They were served with eggrolls and an extremely plain fried rice. I think I saw 1 pea in mine. Overall, I always enjoy China Wok and will continue to order from this place. Oh...1 more tip...order the house made hot mustard as opposed to the packet stuff. Wow!! Its hot!!"}
{"text":"It is a nice Chinese take-out for nearby neighbors."}
{"text":"Sorry, I didn't like egg-fu-yung, the fried rice was drenched in too much soy sauce, and the yellow curry was watery and bland. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Bbq is horrible...it more like imitation bbq.....don't get it and the sauce....sucks....I will not b going back....ugh...I wish they had beeter chinese food made with pride....not just to get by....this sucks..."}
{"text":"As far as fast food Chinese joints go I'm really into this place. 

The portions were great, the food was piping hot when it arrived, and the GrubHub delivery driver was a doll. Take a look at the photos I posted, and you'll see what I'm talking about. 

Loved it! :-)"}
{"text":"I'm a tough critic because I'm Chinese. The Hot and sour soup and the egg roll was my favorite. Had a combo bourbon chicken which was just ok, I could have used more broccoli and moister chicken. The combo came with pork fried rice and the egg roll at a good price so I'll keep trying their food. Next time I'll try something more authentic and see how it goes. Dining in was nice because I was alone and was treated very well!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite family run Chinese food place in town. The food is awesome all hand made basically from scratch with always fresh vegetables. I love how this is a small family business. They're always great for a quick bit and fast delivery and have a pretty spot on catering game. I will always come back here and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star \"chinese\" food. Is it Americanized? Yes. Do I care? No. I actually prefer it.  Is it something to write home about? No... but you know exactly what you're ordering and you get what you paid for. You end up being full and satisfied. They deliver. And they speak english.

This will be my new staple now that New China Gate got such a god awful health inspection."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese in NLV!

In order to appreciate this restaurant, you need to understand that it's not gourmet Chinese food.  This is NY-style Chinese takeout.  Being from NY, I can attest that it's the closest thing to the Chinese takeout that I remember from my childhood.  This is not a place that you will likely want to sit down and dine in though.  It's just not that kind of restaurant.  

I noticed another reviewer comparing this to food from Chinatown in NYC.  It's not supposed to compare in any way to Chinatown in any city!  If you want authentic Chinese cuisine, head to KJ Kitchen on Spring Mountain.  But if you want good tasting americanized Chinese food that makes you question how in the world it went from raw to prepared and in a to go box in about 3.5 minutes, then this is place for you!  

Try the egg rolls (get a couple orders - you get two smallish egg rolls per order) and the wonton soup to start.  Follow that up with some Kung Pao Chicken, Moo Shu Pork, or Sesame Chicken.  You'll end up pleasantly full and likely need a nap :)  That's the sign of some good Chinese takeout in my book.  

Great taste and cheap prices.  That's four stars!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Just had the cho fung and hot and sour. Fat delivery, big portions, quality food. Awesome! This is my second of many deliveries!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is average. Lots of food. Speedy staff. It's a casual buffet. Great for business lunches"}
{"text":"At first glance this does appear to be your typical honest food spot, which it essentially is. I came in for the lunch special and this place isn't terrible, just sub par. The rice tasted like it had been sitting around for awhile, the beef was extremely chewy. The service was A-OK. it's the kind of place that is as advertised, but if I'm in the area and hungry there certainly are better options for the same price point"}
{"text":"I LOVE their House chicken. If you call in your order, it's almost always ready within 10 minutes. Also, the ladies who work the front are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Nice options for plate size (rice bowl, and then larger full meal options). They are always friendly and pretty fast when you go in. The first time I ate there my spicy dish (which I knew would have spice) was covered with red pepper flakes, so there wasn't much flavor except spicy, and I can usually take heat. The second time, I got the same thing, and asked if they could make it half as spicy. The flavor of the dish was good but my chicken didn't taste as cooked as it should've. All in all, it is a decent place, with good prices. Oh, and delivery is free if you place an order greater than $10-$12."}
{"text":"I am one on those people that Chinese food is a take out our leave it option. I like it, but never crave it 
This place is my go to local Chinese food place for take out. It has large portions for an average price."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's not much to look at, but the quality of the food and service is good.  The employees are pleasant and accurate with orders.  I've never had an item missing that I ordered.   They are always very fast to prepare my food."}
