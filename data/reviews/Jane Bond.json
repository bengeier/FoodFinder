{"text":"Recently tried the calamari & chorizo offering and enjoyed it thoroughly. Lots of protein for $11, with tender rings and well spiced sausage. Well balanced dressing over greens provide a great contrast to the meat for overall a great meal."}

{"text":"I recently visited the Jane Bond food truck for lunch, and found it to be so/so.  The food was a little on the heavy and non-finger-foodish type as compared to other trucks in the city.  I ordered the pulled chicken sliders, which were expensive considering you get 3 little burgers in one order.  I really liked the Vietnamese slider the best - because anything with peanut sauce on it is amazing.  The others were BBQ (so/so - good chicken and sauce, but needed some slaw or veggies on it) and Jamaican Jerk (not my thing).  I would have preferred to have 3 Vietnamese sliders personally.  The other items on the menu look and sound delicious, but probably something I would prefer for a sit-down meal."}
{"text":"Went to Jane Bond Food Truck on Canada Day down at Eau Claire.  Line was long, so I thought I'd give it a try (in my experience, long lines means deliciousness).  I didn't know the line was long because of how slow service was going to be.  Fellow travelers with me went to another food truck with the same length of line, got their food, came to join me in line and had finished their food before I was even half-way through the line.  Waited about 50 minutes to order.  Ordered \"brisket\", baked beans, and mac 'n cheese.  Debit machine shut down as I was paying due to low battery, so had to wait another 5 for the order taker to get it back on the dock, rebooted, and my order paid for.  When I got my food, it was warmish, but not hot.  Also, the \"brisket\" was definitely not brisket as my cut had two massive veins of fat running through  the entirety of the slices I got.  I've smoked my own briskets before and I know for a fact that the brisket cut from a cow does not have the large veins of fat that were in this beef.  I am suspecting they used a cheaper cut of beef for this.  The flavor profile was meh, but considering 30% of my meat was actually fat, I found this to be pretty poor. Sides were actually pretty tasty - mac and cheese had some type of crunchy topping that added a nice umami, and the baked beans were deliciously spicy.  But, for a \"BBQ\" food truck, the main dish was incredibly lackluster and unappealing.  Would not visit again."}
