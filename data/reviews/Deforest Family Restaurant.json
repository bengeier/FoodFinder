{"text":"Best small town, long standing family owned and operated restaurant to eat at! Food is always hot and service is excellent!  Even when they are really busy this place strives to get you seated and fed as quickly as possible! I've never had a bad experience here. Their chicken fajita skillets are the best!  Sooo delicious.  Tried the new place Norske Nook in town and had the worst experience. ..will not go back there!  Deforest Family Restaurant for in town meals! Thank you for great service, good and HOT food!"}
{"text":"Ate  breakfast there  last fall with my wife. She was just about finished when she noticed a hair in her food. She didn't say anything- paid the bill and left. She finally agreed to eat  breakfast again a couple of weeks ago. Same story,she was almost finished and AGAIN noticed a hair in her food. This time she showed the waitress and the waitress had the owner come to our table.  \"HE\"  looked at the hair (which was nothing like my or my wife's hair) and he stood there for the next ten minutes telling us it COULDN'T be from his kitchen staff and that other people eat all the food and then \"claim\" to see hair also ,because they are looking for a free meal... Also,he can not run a DNA test on the hair and he has a food inspector stop at his place, etc. etc. etc. No \"sorry\" from him, but just excuse after excuse as to why the hair had nothing to do with his restaurant...   We paid the FULL price for our meals and we will NEVER EVER eat there again.  We have eaten there many times in the past,but the owner should learn something about  handling a customers complain and learn more about costumer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for carry out.  Very nice hostess made some recommendations on dinner.   Took my order and brought me water while I waited. Food was quick, big portions and inexpensive. My wife and I enjoyed it. We've had their breakfast before too. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"Nice simple homey diner. Very friendly staff, huge family friendly menu, salad bar. If you are on the road this beats the same old options."}
{"text":"Decided to try based on yelp reviews on family road trip. Basic family diner. Massive menu. Salad mix from a bag, vegetable side was boiled carrots, green beans and corn served in a little bowl with a packet of butter on top, reminded me of food that would be served at a nursing home."}
{"text":"Omelettes are routinely over done--as in brown and crispy on the outside and dry in the middle. And they taste like cooking oil. Other breakfast items are fine. Coffee is expensive for this area. Very large menu which usually means not freshly prepared. Many daily specials. Friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"I stopped in De Forest on my way home to Minneapolis. I decided to eat here and I am glad I did. First of all, the menu is huge and there is a lot to choose from. I just wanted something simple though and I was not disappointed. They had the best vegetable beef soup I've probably ever eaten in my life! The staff was friendly and made sure to check on you to make sure you got everything you wanted. I will definitely remember this place and stop in again next time I travel through Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with two co-workers, checked Yelp before we went and the reviews were very positive so we decided to give it a try.

Yikes! How can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best \"average\", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn't rate two stars.

I had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt. It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3\" long and deep fried. They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same. I had deep fried batter for lunch!!
I haven't had a meal this bad since I got out of the Navy! 

 My co-workes meals were not much better, one had Chicken Fried Steak and he said it was made out of the box. My other co-worker had the Cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! YUK! 

I hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned \"one\" star. Maybe they have great breakfast! I hope they do because their lunches are sub-par. 

There are other restaurants on this street/highway, I'd give them a try before I stopped here. I know my co-workers and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The service is good. I really love breakfast there and it's delicious. My family and I went for dinner one night. The chicken and dumplings were not what I expected- it's a half a chicken and two drop biscuits covered in gravy. The blueberry cream cheese pie was a nice way to end dinner though."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken dumpling soup. Wraps were light and tasty. Good choice with many menu choices. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was very good. I had the Reuben sandwich. My only suggestion is that the waitress should check back more often to see if we need anything. Otherwise, I recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped by for some breakfast before heading over to Wisconsin Dells. I ordered a two egg breakfast with toast and hash browns. It was delicious. The person I'm with ordered steak and eggs and she loves it. Server is also on point with us and the service is quick.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"A family all day breakfast place that fits the need if you don't want fast food and a reasonably priced sit down slow food restaurant.  Large breakfast menu with skillet breakfasts always one of my favorites.  Ambiance of small town home cooking all the way although I didn't see that much welcoming and friendliness that one usually finds in home cooking spots.  Here's your table, here's your menu, what do you want? Here it is, good bye.  
Nothing wrong with the servings and the amount is ample.  This is a good stop if you are on the road and want a meal to sustain for many more hours of driving.  Coffee is nothing special, so maybe next time an iced tea."}
{"text":"Unlimited hot coffee. I don't have any recollection of what I ate....

I wanted t give it four stars, but that would be a very generous review for a meal I cannot recall.

I know it was decently good, and it's like the only restaurant in Deforest.

For that, I give it four stars."}
{"text":"Gross.  Special said, \"Prime rib sandwich.\"  It was literally a over cooked one piece fatty steak on a sub bun.  Senior citizen hang out.  Overall drab vibe.  Waitress had her kids there while working her shift.  Open early- but not worth your money."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch with family on road trip, could tell we were on to something judging by very friendly greeting and the number of local families. Nice and clean, could use a little Wisconsin kitsch!
Cheese kurds were fresh and not greasy. The chicken dumpling soup is very satisfying if salty. My Ruben was very nicely grilled and just the right size. My wife had the hot turkey sandwich with buttery mashed potatoes, moist turkey and plenty of gravy. We split some generous slices of homemade pies and got back on the road full.
I-94 has plenty of family friendly spots but most are chains, this is clean, good and reasonably priced. Our 'go-to' next time we're traveling."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to grab breakfast or lunch. Great food and great service. We come here every Sunday for breakfast and it has always been delicious."}
{"text":"I eat here regularily because it is consistently good.  Very large menu which makes it tough to choose but never disappointed!"}
{"text":"In town on business, I phoned in an order Togo. Salad we in a tiny container that was about a quarter full, maybe 4 pieces of lettuce, 2 cherry tomatoes and 7 croutons. The ranch dressing was really good though! Cheese curds, I've had better. Cod, very dry and still had bones in it. The guy at the register took my money, didn't say anything else. I stood there until a very nice lady brought my order."}
{"text":"I always like coming here. The service is consistently good. The staff and servers are very nice, fast, and good. The food it's great tasty and the portions are good.  

Great place for family and friends."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast and lunch alike. I've never been for dinner but I assume it's just as good. About once a week me and the family come to this family owned eatery. Cozy with great service. Reasonable prices and delicious food."}
{"text":"Huge menu, fresh tasty food, reasonable prices.  Beats a chain highway place for sure. The chicken dumpling soup alone is worth a trip (fresh made every day and it caused my vegetable-phobic daughter to eat carrots and celery of her own voltion!);  the steak-cut French fries were great and the coconut cream pie was wonderful."}
{"text":"Good small town diner, both the broiled and beer battered walleye was yummy. Go all in and get the fried cheese Kurds and malted milkshake"}
{"text":"Nice clean place with a very friendly staff.  Great homemade chicken dumpling soup and a very tasty club sandwich.  Decor is outdated, but not sloppy. Good local place to bring the family."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and decided to try this place based on yelp reviews. After the terrible experience I figured out the reviews must be old or friends of the employees. 

My co-worker and I were seated quickly. But it took more than 5 minutes for our server to stop at the table. On a Friday or Saturday evening that's ok. Not so much on a Tuesday when it isn't very busy. She gave us the menus and left. Never asked about drinks. Someone else brought us water tho. The server stopped back and asked if we were ready to order about 3 minutes after stopping the first time. We weren't ready because we hadn't even had a chance to get to the second page of the menu. 

She came back about 5 minutes later and took our order. We waited for our drinks to arrive.  The server came to the table again and asked us if we would like drinks. We repeated our previous beverage order and she finally brought them. A few minutes later our salads were brought out......the first problem was my co-worker ordered an omelette......neither of us have ever had a salad with an omelette but he ate it anyway. The second problem was it was just a plate with lettuce, one tomato wedge & one cucumber slice. Nothing much to it at all. 

When our meals finally arrived - almost 35 minutes after we ordered, my prime rib was the smallest I've ever seen. It was also not cooked to my request but I didn't want to send it back for fear of waiting forever. The taste was mediocre. My co-worker said the omelette was ok. 

Service was slow and good was ehh. Would not go hear again. 

They do not take American Express as a side note."}
{"text":"I asked a couple of DeForest locals where to get all-day breakfast, and they sent me to the DeForet Family Restaurant on Hwy V, on the North edge of town, three minutes east of I-90/39, maybe eight - 10 minutes west of US-51.

I was welcomed right away by the host. I read that fried cod was the daily special, including one trip to the salad bar. We passed the salad bar on the way to my booth, and it was great to see a salad bar in a small town restaurant. On other days, I might have gotten the salad bar for lunch.

I had the veggie skillet, for $8, and a cup of coffee for $1.90. The skillet was excellent, and came on a bed of hash browns that could have been crispier. The eggs over easy were perfect. The rye toast was fine. There were potatoes and other veggies in the skillet, which were good.

There were locals of all ages seated in the restaurant around noon on a Friday. Most tables had two people, from those in their 20's at one or two tables, middle aged folks at a few tables, and quite a few mature adults at other tables. I imagined I was the only person from out of town, and the local folks were warm and friendly.

The waitress and person filling the coffee were both attentive, never pushy or hovering. An 83-year-old stopped at my table after eating, and chatted with me briefly on his way to talk with people he knew on his way out. This was very relaxed and warm for the Madison area, where most people tend to be a little more, um, reserved.

I give DeForest Family Restaurant 5 stars. The hash browns could have crispier, but everything else was very good.

My Verizon iPhone only got 3G here, so posting this review took forever. So Verizon gets 3 stars, with coverage in a small town, but with poor speed."}
{"text":"Don't have time and/or cute outfits for Madison but want an alternative to Cracker Barrel? This is your stop. I started with the chicken dumpling soup. Simply divine, so much as to seriously tempt my veg accomplice. Cheese curds were another hit, far superior to those from the state fair.  Wraps, sammys, even the fried mushrooms were consistent, wholesome, and fresh. Service was on point, our waitress Brianna was business pro.  People watching was a little poor(s), to be expected in rural Midwest? I think our impassioned debate over drug use might have startled the crowd.

Nonetheless, not a Cracker Barrel. Takes Amex."}
{"text":"Yummy! Good home cooked food! Came in for a late breakfast after being in a rainy muddy race earlier in the morning and it definitely hit the spot! I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon and crispy hashbrowns. Thank you for cooking the bacon enough ! I hate limpy bacon!!! The service was good. I never had to ask for a refill on my coffee, someone was always there ready to fill it up as I got low. My only complain is the price of adding sides onto your meals. The price of the meal itself seemed fine. But the sides were a little pricy. But overall we definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!! Good service- Waitress staff were some of the friendliest I have ever encountered- food was delicious. The place was packed (it was a Sunday morning). We had a short wait for a table so be patient it's worth the wait. We will be going back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews we tried this place tonight. Sorry but the 4 1/2 stars is way overrated. The chicken fry was a frozen patty with some awful tasting gravy. The side was steamed carrots with no taste. The salad and baked potato were ok but those are kinda hard to screw up. Hubby had a steak that had no flavor. Coconut cream pie was from a box. Service was good but I wouldn't recommend the food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to have breakfast after New Years. We weren't expecting much being not at our best either. 

The service, as mentioned several times in yelp, is really slow. My drink was forgotten about and the next time our waitress came around she was serving our meal about 30-40 minutes from taking our order. The restaurant was probably half full of people. My boyfriends meal was mediocre \"at best\" as he put it but my meal was worse. My bacon and egg omelette was burnt and the cheese was scarce. 

At the end of our meal, our server still charged us for the missing drink but they were kind enough to take it off the bill, that is while we waited 10 minutes standing at the register. I wouldn't go back to this restaurant because I think my time is worth more than they treated it but could be nice for those who think differently."}
{"text":"This whole experience was a disaster. Coffee was weak. Food mediocre, but the waitress was pleasant. I honestly feel bad for her because her boss is a giant bafoon. My daughter in law ordered the broiled walleye and sent it back when the fish she got had the skin still on it. I've worked in restaurants for years and never once have I left the skin, scales and all, on a fresh water fish. The manager refused to comp the fish when my daughter in law ordered grilled chicken instead. He forced us to pay for both the chicken and the fish. Even worse, we could hear the owner scream at our waitress. Poor girl. 

The only positive thing was that the ranch dressing and fried cheese curds were actually really good 

Don't come here if you value your sanity and taste buds"}
{"text":"A really lovely surprise on a rather horrific family road trip.

We were greeted at the door, the waitress was a peach, and the nice man who filled water/helped out was the sweetest guy ever. The food is also great if you're a fan of the diner-type grub; my hot turkey sandwich will live on in my dreams.

You can definitely tell the place has the old time appeal of a great family place as all the locals (mostly older people) know each other and it's clear it's the happening place for breakfast with the over-60 crowd (but hey, that says the food has to be pretty homestyle and tasty to me.)  

If you're headed down 94 and need a good lunch stop, make this it."}
{"text":"We went here twice.  My husband had 2 great meals but I didn't. Guess I just made bad choices. He had the Julianne salad and egg breakfast on 2 visits and both were great. I had chicken fried steak  (My fault for ordering this outside the South) and it was pretty mediocre. I also had the turkey salad sandwich and it was all celery and mayo. I couldn't even taste the turkey. The chicken dumpling soup was good, though. Wait staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  The waitstaff & cooks are great!  They have a huge variety on the menu.  Breakfast's are big portions & tasty.  If you ask for crispy bacon, that's what you'll get.  They invest in their facility & keep the place updated. If you're traveling through on I-94 & looking for local food, this is well worth it."}
{"text":"Homestyle cooking at its best, dnt go to culvers, McDonald's or whatever trash is right off the hwy, head a bit further down u will find this gem, one of the reasons I love this place so much? They dnt play annoying music, scratch that, they don't play ANY music. People working here are super nice as to be expected. If I owned this joint, I would invest in a new bigger sign, as I drove right by this place and almost missed it twice."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there while passing thru. The chicken dumpling soup was the best I have ever had. 
The hot turkey sandwich was awesome got chucks of turkey and smooth tasty gravy. The prices are really good also."}
{"text":"Just ate the worst steak I've ever had: the Butter Garlic Sirloin. It was cooked as I ordered - rare - but all 8oz of it was mealy on the inside and chewy on the outside. Terrible texture. Terrible flavor. Everything else was average except the staff, whose efficiency, courtesy and attention to detail brought the rating up to average."}
{"text":"Love their breakfast menu & they have friendly waitstaff. We go there nearly every Friday for the last 4 yrs.  I love that they don't play any music.  It is quiet, conversational, and comfortable."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. Staff was the best--fast and friendly service, very attentive without interrupting us.  Ordered eggs as soft scrambled and they were just right, fluffy instead of those sheets of egg product that other restaurants serve. I'm picky about French toast too, and this was served hot and just right with warm syrup. Lots of locals here but we felt very welcome. Menu is huge, and we don't know how other meals are. If I had one suggestion, it would be to get new plastic menu covers or new menus period--could get the advertisers to chip in for them. A nice start for the last leg of our road trip."}
{"text":"Breakfast is excellent! Pancakes and prime rib eggs Benedict are my fav! Clean and warm environment. Good service and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Small town, family diner. Great food and service! Always packed for breakfast but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I was returning to Chicago from the Dells and needed to make a lunch stop.  My traveling companions and I did not want to eat fast food so we took the short trip down the main road to Deforest Family Restaurant.  It was a pleasant experience.  The food was definitely better than fast food and our waitress was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and glad we stopped here! Great food along with wonderful and friendly wait staff and owners!"}
