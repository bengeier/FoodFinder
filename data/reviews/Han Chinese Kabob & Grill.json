{"text":"I've since left Cleveland, but I wanted to leave a review for this place because I ate there at least twelve times in the last year. 

When I was in college, I studied abroad in China and ended up living there for five years. I'm originally from Cleveland, and nothing prepared me for authentic Chinese food. I ate myself stupid at small, cheap, restaurants in Beijing and Shanghai, and when I came back, it was hard to find anything comparable. Americanized Chinese food lacks the spice and tang of the real deal, opting instead of sugary, corn-starch heavy sauces. While other Chinese restaurants in the vicinity of Han do a fair job of approximating authentic dishes, Han is the best at capturing the authentic flavor while not drowning its dishes in oil.

The strength of Han is based on its outstanding head chef, who makes ordinary Chinese restaurant staples with flair and excellence. Although Han advertises itself as a kebab place (and the kebabs are really good, and if you've ever eaten chuanr off a grill at midnight in a back alley in Beijing, you'll agree with me), it's best experienced as a northern Chinese restaurant that also serves kebabs. And yes, the kebabs are heavily spiced. If you just want grilled meat, please tell them so, because in China, they pour the spice on with great enthusiasm.

I personally recommend the Dandan Noodles (dandan mian), the spicy string beans (ganbian sijidou) and the Sliced Pork in Garlic Sauce (yuxiang rousi). But everything is good - I haven't had a bad dish here.

Service is prompt and friendly. Prices are very reasonable. Clean and simple decor with adequate parking. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love the shush kabob! I also love the soup! The people working there seemed really nice! We will defiantly come back here again!"}
{"text":"I am preparing for a trip to Beijing and a friend who lived in various cities in china recommended this restaurant to me on account that it was the most authentic Chinese food in Cleveland. I was not disappointed. I ordered Korean spicy noodles and a fish dish and each dish was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. The servers were extremely friendly and had great suggestions. I will never go to any other Chinese restaurant in Cleveland possibly ever again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Even though there were only one waitress for the entire restaurant, she did pretty good in taking care of us. Only compliant is that it is way too pricey for this kind of eatery. Most likely not come back."}
{"text":"Lamb skew is a traditional food in the city where I am from. The lamb skew is really not bad at all. Tasty cumin powders, good pepper powders, and hight quality meat justify my recommendations. A little more juice in meat would have been slightly better. I will try less cooked next time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The lamb skewers are a must-order at this authentic Chinese restaurant. With a variety of \"American Chinese\" and \"Chinese Chinese\" items to pick from on the menu, Hans has something for anyone. Like most Chinese restaurants, most of the items are better eaten family style so that you can get a bigger variety of flavors. We ordered the Mongolian beef, Stewed pork, saut√©ed string beans, chicken fried rice, and lamb skewers. The stewed pork was excellent and probably one of their most popular dishes, besides the lamb skewers. Lamb skewers can be made not spicy at all to painfully hot, depending on your preference. And the fried rice is surprisingly good. The only thing I might recommend staying away from is the eggplant dish, which was slightly undercooked the last time I tried it."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Sunday and ordered the seaweed salad, chicken Kung bao and lamb skewers (with an extra one for checking in!). The service was pretty slow considering the amount of servers to patrons when we went. However, The food was delicious! The lamb was well seasoned and the chicken dish was just the right amount of spicy and sweet. I didn't love the seaweed salad, it was a little oily for me. But otherwise, we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. Seriously....great food. Service was pretty slow. For a quick lunch, look elsewhere. This would be a solid 4-5 stars if it didn't take 20min for us to get an order of fried rice and beef kabobs."}
{"text":"It's all good!  Good service. good food. Good music. Fried rice is very good with garlic green beans. We tried the whole fried fish with tamarind sweet and sour sauce. I enjoyed it very much, but my daughter thought it was a bit too sweet. The location is convenient if you work near downtown and the parking is free"}
{"text":"This is an awful restaurant. I've been waiting for forty minutes and no one even cares about our table. Bad service, one star at most"}
{"text":"Han Chinese has been open just a short time, but they are light years ahead of most Chinese in Cleveland, and slightly better than the others. I typically go for lunch.

Pros:
-Clean (but also new)
-A good value
-Decent music
-Visually striking plating
-Extremely firm grasp of how to build flavor
-Good portion size without being ridiculous
-The food is well above average even for my favorite Chinese restos elsewhere

Cons:
-Not the best grasp of English (don't expect the blow-by-blow on each dish), but effective enough to take your order.
-Menu would greatly benefit from a list of ingredients in each dish in English (or a picture)."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Loved the lamb kabobs! Reasonably priced menu. Looking forward to going back. Might be a good idea to add a table with a lazy Susan for larger parties. Would be nice to have some authentic Chinese spices on the table"}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars!!!

Server(s): Excellent, always making sure I'm satisfied with the meal(s), my water never get low, my plate(s) always off the table before my check comes 

Meal: Bravo, 8.5 times never disappointed on my meal(s), if I'm disappointed, I'll tell them, they never hesitate and quickly fix my meal without bitching about it.. 

Restaurant: very clean 

Overall, I'm always satisfied!!"}
{"text":"I am a Chinese and have been in Cleveland for almost 5 years (you probably can tell that from my broken English). I am so glad we finally have a restaurant specialized in skewers in Cleveland! What's even better is that they have much more than skewers! My parents are going to visit me this summer and Han is on my to-go list. Here's what I have tried so far:

Lamb skewer: if you are born and grew up in China, make sure to get the lamb skewer, one of the most famous Chinese street food! Their lamb skewer is even better than most of what you can get in China!

Beef skewer: it looks like this is more for those who like skewer but doesn't like lamb. It's also good but just not what I was growing up with.

Others:
Shredded Chicken (combination of a little spicy and a little sweet)
Stewed Pork (all my friends love it!)
Chef's Special Noodle Skin (there's wasabi in the sauce)
Spicy Baby Chicken (not very oily but still very good)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch- had 3 kabobs potstickers, spring roll sesame balls- Dan Dan noodles and corn and pine nuts. Everything was very very very good- the potsticker sauce was exceptional as were the potstickers, not boo long but close. Anyhow, give it a shot- really really really really good- also you can't beat the music"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Chinese in NEO. My go to is the egg fried rice and salt and pepper shrimp (San the shell). The Beijing eggplant is really good, too."}
{"text":"I wanted to eat everything on this menu. This is not your typical Chinese takeout, though the menu at first glance is formatted very similarly to your favorite Americanized Chinese food takeout spot. Rest assured, this is an altogether more authentic experience offered at a spotlessly clean, modern setting. 

I had to stop in here after being floored by how delicious the food looked in an Instagram post (https://instagram.com/p/BL_v5RYhfyJ/) and wouldn't rest until I had it in front of me. The food absolutely delivered on how incredible it looked!

We had the boiled crispy fish fillet (get this!!!), spicy Korean noodle soup (just as good as any local ramen place), Chinese bok choy with shiitakes, and lamb skewers. I highly recommend all of it, and can't wait to try everything on the menu. I also love that they locally source their lamb. 

We called in an order for pickup, but at 6pm on a Sunday there were several busy tables. I would be happy to eat in next time, as the place is clearly set up as a nice, neat restaurant focused more on dine in than takeout. Super nice service."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you normally don't tell people about because its so good you want to keep it to yourself. The service and food are amazing!!! The salt and pepper shrimp and lamp kabobs are out of this world. Its a small place but its worth the drive out to the east side to finally have amazing food."}
{"text":"I walked in about 30 minutes before closing and wanted 2 dishes prepared with white meat only. I was told that it was not possible. Then I asked again saying please. The chef accommodated me as did the waitress, whom was so very sweet. Turns out it was the best Chinese food I've ever had in Cleveland. Sesame chicken and KP chicken....WOW!!!!!"}
{"text":"Whoa! Probably my new favorite Chinese restaurant after 5+ years of living in the area. Where have I been one may ask? Apparently not living right. I'll blame school... Anyways, we ordered fried rice, lamb kabobs and string beans with dried chili. I've frequented similarly styled restaurants in the area and this place just incorporates fresher looking ingredients. The string beans were by far my favorite! They were crunchy and fresh with a good balance of spicy and saltiness with hints of ginger and garlic that had me going for more. The lamb kabobs, although smaller in person, were well seasoned. We got the medium spicy and that was a little too much for me. I'll know for next time. The fried rice complemented the rest of the dishes well. I'm already plotting what I'll get on our next visit!"}
{"text":"I came for the Kabobs but was taken aback by the prices.  For something a little more than a Beef Teriyaki stick where you normally get 4 or 5 for $4-$7, these were all well in excess of $10.
Next door is Map of Thailand, a much better value."}
{"text":"Just good old fashioned Chinese food, like what I would find in Chicago.  The servers were very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"having just relocated to the Cleveland area from the NYC metro (north Jersey) I was getting depressed about the \"white bread\" Ohio atmosphere and then I discovered Asiatown and tried the magnificent grilled lamb plate At this wonderful establishmenf and felt like I had intravenously injected Prozac. I understand this to be cuisine from somewhere in northern China, well it is freakin' fantastic. The restaurant is very clean , the ambience and decor are nice, and the food is good. I can tell this and other Payne Avenue establishments will be my shelters from the storm of meat and potatoes melanin-deficient Ohio-Murica. They have a parking lot."}
{"text":"The food here is way more than delicious. I have been here at least twice every week since they told me they were under a new management. RECOMMEND TO EVERYBODY WHO WANTS A FRESH NEW TASTE IN CLEVELAND."}
{"text":"To start off the menus they gave us were takeout menus which was pretty odd. Then when we did get our food the salt and pepper pork ribs were a dark grey color and tasted very bland. The lamb and beef skewers were over spiced to the point where we couldn't taste the meat and only the same spice that was on everything. We left pretty hungry :("}
{"text":"Came to check out this new Chinese place on Monday with my wife.  Overall, food was pretty good.  Different, in a northern Chinese way.  Enjoyed the fatty pork.  Dan-dan mien was a little liquidy but tasty.  I like the cumin lamb but my wife thought it was too spicy or cumin-y.  Wait staff was polite and helpful.  I plan to come back, not as my go to Chinese place but definitely when I'm looking for something different."}
{"text":"this is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in Cleveland. though some dishes are a little pricey, I have found something the menu for everyone that has joined me. every dish that I have ordered has been tasty and I have never found any faults with the food. the wait staff is friendly and tries to be helpful, but like most places if you are extremely adventurous you need to ask them for the really interesting dishes or speak Chinese."}
{"text":"We travelled to Cleveland for a weekend getaway, and have done some research on good chinese restaurants in this area. 
The environment of this place is pretty nice. We tried to order grilled squid, but they are out, so we ordered grilled beef instead. However, we are not quite sure they gave us the grilled beef or lamb, cuz the meat has some unpleasant taste, but the waitress insisted it's beef.  We found not only the meat, but the seasoning is not quite pleasant either... Two of us only placed 1 order which comes with 6 skews, and we couldn't finish the entire order cuz of the unpleasant flavor. This place is supposed to serve good grill & kabob, however we are pretty disappointed at their kabob. 
We also ordered couple appetizers, the Szechuan cold noodle and sliced pork with garlic sauce. These 2 appetizers are pretty tasty, the cold noodle is leaning toward oily side. 
The 2 stars of this review are for the tasty appetizers. Their food are pretty authentic Chinese dishes, but definitely not a fan of their kabob."}
{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurant in the United States, yes it's a little expensive, but acceptable. I took many of my foreign friends there and they all loved ?????I also love their barbeque., not too much, not too spicy. They offer free rice to every dish."}
{"text":"This place is spicy! And this is coming from someone who thinks Sriracha tastes sweet, and Tabasco as just sour. I came with some friends for a dinner to check out this place, since one said it looked \"legit\" when he passed by this place last week and I trust his word since he's more Asian than I am.

We ordered:

1. Szechuan cold noodles (4/5) - for lack of a better description, it's \"spaghetti\" noodles with spicy sauce and julienned cucumbers. We were confused what this dish was compared to the \"spicy cold noodles\" was; apparently spicy cold noodles refers to the sauce being sesame sauce.

2. Lamb kabobs (5/5) - WOW these were cooked well. It's marinated and garnished with tons of cumin and spice. They were tender, juicy and delicious. I could have definitely polished off the entire entree myself with some rice, but sharing is caring, so I had to split with my friends. Sadness.

3. Boiled beef in hot & spicy sauce (aka Water boiled beef, shui zhu niu) (4.5/5) - For those who haven't had Szechuan food before, this is anything but water boiled. It comes in a giant bowl and looks like a giant soup of pure spicy oil and chili peppers. You fish out the pieces of beef and napa cabbage out and eat it with rice. Yum yum. I liked this, but this one was much spicier than ones at other restaurants, and one of my friends said it was a little salty.

4. Beef noodle soup (5/5) - The dish tasted a lot better than it looked. We weren't too sure what the difference was between this and the \"Szechuan beef noodle soup\" that was listed right below; the waitress just said it was spicy. I'm sure it's also prepared slightly differently too. Sometimes, poorly braised and cut beef is hard to eat and meat gets stuck in your teeth (eww!), but this is not the case here! But the beef was amazingly tender and juicy. The soup was pretty sweet and oily and I actually found myself drinking the soup.

Service was a little slow, but it isn't enough to deter me from coming back. We had finished our food and sat around for 10 minutes before we were able to flag the waitress down to ask for a menu since we wanted to order more food. It was only at that time she cleared our dishes out. It wasn't very busy either, maybe 4 other tables. The restaurant did let us split checks, which was much appreciated.

As a random side note, one of my friends recognized the waitress as possibly having worked at Siam Cafe in the past since he used to eat there 1-2x a week, which was pretty hilarious and ridiculous at the same time."}
{"text":"Xingjiang style lamb:  it was the first time I ever tried this dish.  It was delicious.   Spicy and fragrant depth.  I noticed Indian influences in the flavor notes.  The spicy heat of the dish had real kick.  I'm looking forward to having this again.  (Actually I'm leaving this review for me to remember how much I enjoyed this dish for when I come back).  

Another long time favorite is the \"wood ear with mushrooms\": simply prepared which highlights the variety of flavors from the different mushrooms.  They each have a different consistency and chewiness as well.  I order this one every time I come here.   Always great."}
{"text":"Great place to try! The food is very good. Atmosphere is subdued and quiet.  Definitely one of Cleveland's best kept Chinese restaurant secret. They have spicy and non spicy dishes. Highly recommended and will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Very flavorful northern Chinese food. The Szechuan stuff had good flavoring and even \"mild\" spicy was enough to get our noses dripping. Liked that they had a big variety of grilled meats. We got the squid legs which was grilled perfectly, tender yet moist and not too chewy. 

Strangely, this place is decorated like an old school American restaurant, not Chinese at all. They even play American oldies!!"}
{"text":"This place is too good. We had the grilled squid, lamb skewers, and boiled fish in hot and spicy sauce. 

The fish was unbelievably good. The flavors were rich with the right amount of garlic and heat, fish was tender and generous in portion. In fact we were surprised to find there were more fish than tofu/cabbage in the dish - something that has seriously never been the case anywhere else. If you could take spicy, this will not disappoint. 

Now the skewers. the squid was nicely done loaded with cumin and a tasty tangy glaze. I wasn't a huge fan of their lamb as I thought it was a bit on the dry side. However I was alone in this verdict. 

Nice interior and service, price was very fair for what we ordered. Authentic dishes. Would love to come again if I'm ever back in the city."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Han Chinese Kabob and Grill. 4.5 stars for now but will start it at 5 because we had an overall great experience. I didn't grow up eating these types of flavors, and only when I went to western china for a summer as an adult did I really get exposed for the first time. When I got back stateside, I really craved these flavors! I really enjoy how diverse the flavors in Chinese cooking can be. 

We arrived on a Sunday evening for a meal - plenty of seating available, but also a steady stream of people coming in to eat. Our small party ended up ordering a bunch of different types of food to try - it was definitely double what we could handle but we were happy to take leftovers home. Here we go:

Appetizers:

4 - Potato salad - cold, thinly sliced/julienned, lightly cooked/raw potato with chili flakes + peppercorn. You can get this as a main dish, larger, hot/stir fried. This is one of the small appetizer dishes that I missed the most from China! Very clean flavor as there isn't much oil. The flavor went well with...

3.5 - ...Chef's Noodle Special - cold, flat, rice noodles with a slightly spicy sauce (horseradish flavor) with julienned veggies + egg. It's a great raw dish. I really like the dish in general, but found this one to be a little watery w/ not enough of the sauce. We think it's b/c the veggies weren't drained enough of the water. It's also usually banquet size, but I think it's a good portion for this size of a restaurant. Probably shareable between 4 people. Hopefully they will adjust as this is such a crave-worthy dish.

4 - Tomato and egg soup - clean and delicious flavor, great on a cold fall day. Pretty standard flavor, but good nonetheless.  

MAINS:

5 - Lamb kabobs - I have been craving these like crazy. Totally reminds me of the mutton kabobs we used to eat that summer. We ordered it spicy and it did not disappoint. After we placed the order, we could smell a wood burning stove in the back. Our guess is that they have one in the back for the kabobs. I checked in on yelp and got a free kabob skewer :) Ours was really tender. The dish comes with 6 skewers, but if you get enough dishes, it should totally be enough. 

5 - Stir fried cabbage - this one has one of my favorite spices...prickly ash!! I love how these dishes are able to have tons of flavor while not using that much oil. The dish was crunchy. We noticed that both the cabbage and red chills had a char (again probably from the bbq) on the edges - so good.

4.5 - Tomato beef noodle soup - I have been looking for this holy grail. The sweetness of the tomato broth was a welcome break from the other flavors. Just keep in mind that it's not Taiwanese style - so the beef comes sliced rather than in shank form. I thought the broth was a winner though.

5 - Xinjiang LAMB - ok, definitely spicy and matches the flavor of the stir fried cabbage. By the time we got it we were really full. Definitely shareable between 4+ people. Lots of prickly ashhhhh and cumin seeds. As you may know, Xinjiang province is in western China and has a high Muslim population. (no pork!) so lamb/mutton is a huge part of the halal cuisine there. Such a different experience than on the coast. 

3.5 - Pickled pork belly - we thought we were ordering something similar to the twice cooked pork belly (should've listened to the waitress!) but we decided to try this one. The main flavor on this one is definitely sour - they use lots of sour veggies with crystal noodles and bits of pork. It reminded me of sauerkraut. My palette is not used to the intensity of sourness so we barely made our way through and it felt off for us (maybe a hint of sweetness would have helped). Also, it's a huge portion and the ratio of cabbage to meat to noodles was off. 

OVERALL:
We found this place to have really diverse flavors. We also liked that it relied more on spice + flame rather than oil, unlike some other nearby restaurants.  Since I didn't grow up with the flavors, it was definitely an adjustment. But a welcome adjustment.

Service wise - similar to other Chinese restaurants. Don't be afraid to make eye contact and slightly raise your hand in the air - it's culturally acceptable. We had to do that a few times for tea and water. Otherwise, it's clean and cafe style. 

Great place to come in if you want a quick bite too - we saw a few students come in for a skewer snack w/ the fried green beans. 

Great first visit - we'll be back."}
{"text":"If you want some traditional and authentic Chinese food, this is where it's at!! I was born in China and lived there for the first several years of my life, so I can attest to the authenticity of this place :) Their most popular dish is the lamb kabobs. I highly, highly, highly recommend getting this!! Lamb kabobs are probably one of the most renowned street foods in China, so I'm really glad Han Chinese is bringing them to Cleveland :) It's $13 for 6 kabobs, which can seem a bit pricey, but it's worth the splurge! The seasoning, which is composed mainly of peppers and cumin, is so authentic that it makes me feel like I'm eating in China's night market. I also tried the Dandan noodles, one of my favorite dishes of all time. Han Chinese did a great job with this as well! It was spicy (but not overwhelming) and savory :) Make sure you check in to receive a free lamb kabob with your purchase of a lamb kabob order!! 

Pros: 
- Authentic Chinese food (finally!)
- Clean restaurant 
- Price is decent 
- Waiters speak Mandarin 

Cons:
- Slow service; it took them 30 minutes to make the kabobs even though we were the only people in the restaurant. A warning from the waiters would've been helpful!
- Waiters don't speak English very well"}
{"text":"Everyone has a bucket list in life, mine is slowly trying everything on this menu. Finally got to dine in and I wish I could add on an extra star. We tried a couple of the lunch specials which are affordable, filling, and delicious!!!!! We got the genera tso, the fried noodles, I had to get the dry chili chicken; and we got a skewer each of lamb, beef, chicken. If you ask for spicy, they give you spicy. It's so great. The egg drop soup was good too. It was super thick and subtly flavored, I can imagine it doing just the trick on a day you're not feeling so hot. Additionally our server (owner? Hostess?) was really nice and whenever she walked past our table with other dishes she showed us and told us what it was. Like I said, can't wait to check off more items from the menu."}
{"text":"The fam was in town, and, as standard Chinese parents, they wanted to eat Chinese. I had heard good things about Han, but had never gone, so I figured this would be a good chance.

I'm happy to say this place is Chinese family approved!

There's a distinctly northern Chinese taste to most dishes here, which you don't always find (typically you see Szechuan, Hunan, Cantonese, etc.). My family, being from the Northeast part of China, was excited by just that fact. After trying each dish, my parents would nod and say \"pretty accurate / authentic\". Mind you, I was too busy scarfing down the food to say anything, but I definitely agreed.

Some dishes I would suggest: Hui Guo Rou (twice cooked pork), Yu Shiang Qie Zi (braised eggplant), Tang Cu Tu Dou Si (Stir Fried Vinegar Shredded Potato)

Excited to have found this place as now I have a go to Szechuan place (Szechuan Gourmet) and a go to place for a taste closer to home."}
{"text":"Food was very good. It took 20 minutes to get the skewers which seamed a bit long. The flavors where very unique and different for your run if the mill Chinese place. Small place that gets a bit busy during lunch. Eat slow and enjoy."}
{"text":"I've frequented other restaurants in the area, but had not yet tried Han.  I met a friend there on a Thursday evening.  I was excited to try the popular lamb kabobs.  We proceeded to order, lamb kabobs, chicken kabobs and the Dan Dan noodles, along with spring rolls.  Our food arrived a short time later.  I LOVED the noodles and the spring rolls.  The chicken kabobs were just ok, nothing to write home about,  but can't say that I enjoyed the lamb.  As other Yelpers have stated, our lamb kabobs were ALL fat, no lean meat.   There was a nice, spicy kick to the kabobs, but I couldn't finish them.  I'm glad that I finally had an opportunity to try this place, but can't say that I will rush back, anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great northern Chinese food!! The pork stew is AMAZING!!! The place was nice and CLEAN!! No sticky floors or weird smell."}
{"text":"Items ordered: Dan Dan noodles/# 195 boiled beef in spicy Szechuan sauce/Mixed seafood dumpling/lamb and beef kabobs. Han's has been on my yelp radar for a bit now. Finally decided to make a stop in today for lunch with my sisters bf. The dan dan noodles were tasty loved the chili oil in the bottom. I don't think there was actually Szechuan pepper corns in the dish but I could be wrong it was not very spicy-flavor was good but for my taste if could be hotter my friend said it was perfect for him. I always wanted to try dan dan noodles now I can compare to other establishments in the future. The kabobs were good. I did not eat the beef but the lamb were tender and spicy. The kabobs are small for the $6 price. the mixed seafood dumplings were a bit to fishy for me but my friend enjoyed them. The star dish was the boiled beef in spicy Szechuan sauce. It made my mouth pleasantly numb. the beef so tender and the broth tasty"}
{"text":"Wow! Came to this place by chance on the way home from downtown. I said to myself \"Chinese kabobs?... must try it!\" Was hungry and decided to get some take out just to try it. Known for their lamb skewers, I got a few... half spicy, half mild. And I also decided to try their pork belly with garlic appetizer. Smelled so good in the car, I couldn't wait to get home and chow. Wow, wow, wow! Where do I start? The lamb... amazing! I like lamb, but it has to be done just right. Most lamb not prepared well has that musty/gamey after taste. This did not! It was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, perfectly flavored! Both mild and spicy were delicious! And there was this distinct flavor that really brought it home... couldn't tell exactly what it was... maybe just from grilling... maybe smoke? I don't know, but it was damn good!

And the garlic pork belly? Wow! It was awesome as well! I couldn't believe this was just an appetizer. They need to offer it as an entree. That spicy sauce and seasonings over rice? Hmmm! Couldn't decide if I liked the lamb or pork belly better. I guess I'll have to go back and re-order so I can decide. And if I can't decide yet... I'll be okay with trying for the rest of my life. It's that good! Safe to say I think I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant twice since it opened two weeks ago. My favorite dish is stewed pork (hong shao rou) because it is very authentic and reminds me of home.

Another dish I like is crispy and spicy zhu da chang (pork), which is another authentic Chinese dish. 

What differentiates Han from a lot of other Chinese restaurants is the fact that the dishes there are not that greasy. 
 
Typically, I do not eat lamb, because I cannot stand the smell of lamb. However, the lamb skewers they served there really impressed me. My friends ordered some and persuaded me to try. I was brave and took a risk. Well, it was definitely worth a try because the meat was so tender without any weird smell of lamb at all. Highly recommend the lamb skewers.  I got the spicy one and added extra hot pepper powder on it (love their hot pepper powder). 

In addition, the service was really good; the waitress and waiter were willing to help and cared about the customers.

Lastly, the restaurant was very clean; I had a really good time enjoying authentic Chinese dishes with friends."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Chinese place in Cleveland. Go there anytime, and it's chock full of Chinese people because they know this is where it's at. The menu is very authentic, and as a Northern Chinese person, there is stuff on there that you won't find at any other Chinese restaurant in town (hello, deep fried sweet potatoes with sugar glaze!!). I love that the chef does not over-season the food which allows you to taste the actual ingredients. You won't find any Americanized brown sauce (or any puddles of gratuitous sauce) in their dishes. 

Some favorites: salt and pepper squid, wonton with chili oil, noodle with meat sauce, eggplant and diced pork noodle, spicy chicken dry pot, fish fillet with black bean sauce, twice cooked pork, mixed seafood with tofu casserole, celery with dried tofu, stir fried pea pods, shredded potato with chili pepper, and their lamb kabobs. Seriously, I've never ordered anything here that I haven't liked.

Authentic, authentic, authentic. I think you'll find any reviews under 4 stars on Yelp are from non-Chinese people."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place since it opened, the quality is pretty consistent. This is the only chinese restuarant i would go in cleveland. The restuarant was renovated recently. The menu was updated adding lots of new dishes! you definity should go check it out! i would recommend lamb spine, crisp duck and crisp shrimp!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here and look forward to going back. I ordered the lunch chicken with garlic sauce, which came with choice of soup (eggdrop or sweet and sour), peppers and onions mixed in, white or fried rice, and an egg roll. The prices are great as I got all that food for $7.95. I ordered a side of mixed vegetables to go with it and my bill came to $13 including the tip. There was plenty of food and I had leftovers. Everything came out boiling hot, I couldn't eat for at least 10 minutes but it was delicious. There was a good amount of seating inside. The staff was very nice and helpful. The interior is nice but could use a little spruce, things seemed a little worn. Overall, I recommend"}
{"text":"This restaurant features northern Chinese cuisine. I am from northern part of China, and yes, I agree that the signature lamb kabob is authentic northern cuisine. It is the same as you would expect in a restaurant in northeastern China. The northern Chinese dishes are salty and savory. For kabobs, cumin is an essential spice and this gives the kabobs a special taste. 
However, other dishes I ordered are disappointing. I would only give 3 star for the food. However, the service is great and the restaurant looks pretty clean. Overall I'd say 3.5 star for this place. Round up to 4 star because of the service. 
I would go back to try other dishes though.

Review for specific dish
Green Bean: tastes fishy. It's quite strange when your vegetables taste fishy and there was too much garlic.
Eggplant in garlic sauce: I think they used pre made sauce for eggplant. The sauce tastes too similar to Lee Kum Kee eggplant sauce (which is definitely not authentic). In addition, the eggplant is so bland. 
Steamed whole fish: average 
Beef soup: tastes great. It's a real hassle to avoid all the carrots and green beans though.. It would be perfect if cilantro is used instead of carrots and beans."}
{"text":"A new restaurant on the block. Went with a few friends. Kabobs are on the more expensive side for a chinese restaurant and despite its namesake, they are just OK. Nothing special, but not too shabby either. The lamb skewer is not overcooked / dry, but definitely could be more tender. 

Other classic dishes such as shichuan eggplant is basically what youd get at any other chinese restaurant. Honestly, nothing spectacular to write home about. Just another Chinese restaurant in a city that does not have many.

Note, i did want to try the beef noodle soup tho... So i probably have to come back for that. =D"}
{"text":"I've been eating chinese food all my life, and this has got to be my favorite place in Cleveland ! The foods pretty tasty, I recommend the fried shrimp covered in salty egg yolk. (not named that way), actually you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Give it a try if you haven't been. You're sure to not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good Manchuria food. Ordered curry beef noodle to eat and some other dishes to go. Fabulous!"}
{"text":"I love a good Chinese restaurant. I've been a \"regular\" at Han for the better part of two years now, and while there are a couple of close seconds in the area, Han for me is the best! Quiet, friendly service, and a great menu with many different dishes aside from the standard Genetal Tso's Chicken. 

Much like many of the Asian restaurants in this area of town, you may have some apprehensions about going in at first. It can be overwhelming if not awkward, especially for a suburbanite such as myself. But I would encourage you to cast aside any feelings of uneasiness and give this place a try. There is a bit of a language barrier from time to time with some of the servers, but they will always take the time to try to understand what it is you are looking for, and they truly want to make it a pleasant experience for you. I've gotten to know a number of them over the past couple of years, and they're always eager to introduce me to new dishes.  Put yourself out there with a friendly smile, and you'll be amazed at the response you will get. 

On the menu-side of things, I can't say enough about a couple of their dishes in particular. The Korean Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup for example, is piquant with Korean spices, chunks of squid and shrimp, cabbage, carrots, udon noodles. Yum! Other delicious offerings that are a bit more toward the authentic side are the Xinjang Style Lamb (spicy ), Chongquin Casserole () , Boiled Fish in Spicy Szechuan Sauce (), and Mapo Tofu. Don't let the  scare you though, if that's not your thing tell them, and they can tone down the spice for you. 

I'm in there at least once a week for lunch, if not more. I've never had a bad experience at Han, and I often find new things, or specials to try. If you like Chinese, and care to be a little daring, Han is the place to open you up to a while new world of Chinese food."}
{"text":"Second time here in a year. Went for the lamb kabobs. The 1st time they were excellent - 6 to an order. This time, they changed to half the price and 3 to an order. No big deal. However, there was so much fat on the lamb. 4 pieces were all fat and no meat. The flavor is very good...but based on this experience, won't go back as I can't stand eating visible fat and it grosses me out just the sight of it on my meat. This is cutting corners.

On a good note, the jellyfish salad had good flavor, but very small portion and the menu said it would have bok choy. Result = no bok choy :(

The place was quiet with 2 tables at 7 PM and servers standing around. They were very pleasant and happy to accommodate. I hope they can improve."}
{"text":"When I first looked at the menu, I was so excited to find another place that served hot and spicy beef (unfortunately Wonton Gourmet has been skimping on the spicy lately). While Han's beef was slightly spicier, it was way too heavy on the salt and another spice (round like a seed pod, I keep forgetting its name) so that it just coats your tongue in an unpleasant way. 

The lamb kabobs were ok, but they tasted just like the ones you get from street vendors in NYC. nothing special, especially for $13.

Chicken fried rice was pretty good, and overall I was full at the end of the meal. The portions are definitely big enough to share or have a good amount of leftovers. It had a cute, spacious layout for a smaller restaurant and the servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"Wow! A hidden gem. We had the beef curry soup, woodear salad, wontons in chili oil, lamb beef and steamed bun kabobs. Can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu. The dishes were on point and very tasty. The atmosphere was warm and the service was good. Worth a try if your looking for authenticity and something new."}
{"text":"This is my third time with my family. I like the boiling fish and Lamb Skewer very much! The kabob tastes great! The taste is same as I eat in China. :)"}
{"text":"From the outside, this restaurant is pretty unassuming. Small. Part of a strip mall in Asia Town. Limited parking.

But if you can get past that to step inside, you're in for a massively flavorful treat. Note: if you're sensitive to spiciness, heed the hot dish ratings in the menu.

We ordered a few meat kabobs, lamb and beef. They were seasoned well with a lot of kick. They were also tender and decent in portions.

I ordered one of the best dishes I've had in CLE in a while. Period. The twice cooked pork. It was downright succulent, served with cabbage and other veggies. It had a saltiness and a slight spice that suited it well. It was served with a side of rice.

My bf opted for the boiled beef, a house specialty. He has a much higher tolerance for spice than I, so he loved it. It came in a hot pot with various spices and veggies. I tried one bite and my tongue became overwhelmed by heat. It was good but hellsa hot. Also served with a side of rice.

I can't wait to return. The service was wonderful. They were very attentive, courteous and friendly. Now, time to shamelessly eat my leftovers for breakfast at 9:26 a.m."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has great service and amazing food! The lamb, chicken kabobs were perfectly cooked. My plates were taken when we were done instantly. I would definitely come back here all the time!"}
{"text":"Yay for the growing number of Asian restaurants in CLE! Variety is always good! This was my first time here, and we actually didn't have to wait long to be seated. Usually the place is packed, since it's the new restaurant in town. We ordered two different types of kabob, lamb and beef. The lamb was good, I liked how they packed on the spices and the meat was actually tender. The beef kabob was too dry for my taste, I probably wouldn't order that again. We also ordered shredded potatoes with Szechuan peppercorn, sour cabbage (sort of like sauerkraut) with meat, and Szechuan style chicken. The food was pretty good, I love how they have more authentic \"homey\" dishes, like the sour vegetables with meat. These are dishes real Chinese people eat at home, sorry to say....mama doesn't make us orange chicken for dinner lol. I think the only downside to eating here was the service. The staff could be more attentive, so we wouldn't have to constantly beckon them over to our table. Also we ordered a beef noodle soup, which they completely forgot about. I was a bit sad we didn't get to try it, but we had more than enough food so I guess it worked out. I'll probably be back to give this place another try, and see just how good their beef noodle soup is. Hopefully by then the servers will be more alert, and not forget to put in certain orders to the chef!"}
{"text":"Its really good food, nice spice and heat! Honestly, it would probably be a new favorite except that it seemed a little pricier than I'm used to for Chinese food in the area, coming in at like $15 per person before tip and filling but with no leftovers! 

Those lamb kabob's are awesome though!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like it. It was almost right. Almost. 

The dan dan noodles had a good flavor but the sauce was too liquid-y, and the noodles over cooked. There was no ma-la to them, and they didn't give much quantity for the price. 

The fatty pork was the best dish. It was actually fantastic and they should tout it instead of the lamb skewers. 

The lamb kabobs coulda been, shoulda been, and woulda been great if they hadn't had such a heavy hand with the seasoning. The meat was moist and tender, the marinated meat was flavorful. If you order it, I strongly recommend you tell them to leave off the dusting of seasoning. That made it sooooo salty. I couldn't bear to eat more than one bite. 

The potato dish was the true definition of \"meh\"....a little crunchy, and yet somehow also a little soggy. And not appetizing looking in the least.

The last dish was another noodle one, I didn't try it, but I took a picture. 

So, I would have given them a 3 except I was using my water cup to rinse off the spiciness from everything for my 6 yr old- (btw nothing says it's spicy but it pretty much all was) and they came by several times and despite seeing my oily red water, they never inquired whether I might like another glass of fresh water. 

It wasn't cheap either....even if I did live in Cleveland I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"It's much more expensive than I thought it would be. I went in with my friend and got lamb & squid kabobs, a beef in spicy broth dish, and spicy pork belly appetizer. The spicy pork belly was the best dish (lots of good flavor & not too spicy). The lamb and squid bbq had lots of flavor (2nd favorite). I'd come back for the pork belly and lamb kabobs."}
{"text":"In the relatively Cantonese dominated Chinatown of Cleveland, OH, it's hard to find very good Northern Chinese food. Han Chinese is a fairly solid entry in the Northern Chinese cuisine fare. The skewers are solid, as are the dan dan noodles and zha jiang mian. My parents are not big on sweets so we did not get the deep fried sweet potatoes, but I definitely want to try those in the future."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food. Best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Well, the name of this restaurant is a bit of a misnomer.  Quite honestly I expected actual grills on the tables or something - but the grill repertoire (3 types of kabobs, maybe 4 other grill items) was a tiny subset of a fairly extensive typical Chinese menu.

We had the beef kabobs which did not taste very Chinese to me (though apparently they are a very specific regional Northern Chinese street food).  They were seasoned with an overwhelmingly strong mix of spices that tasted Mediterranean or Middle Eastern to me (cumin? fennel?).  The meat was not marinated though - or if it was, it needed a lot more marinade.  Can't comment on the authenticity, but overall, I felt that the kabobs were overseasoned and underseasoned at the same time, and I did not enjoy them.  And at $7 for 3 kabobs they seemed pricey to me.

Now that being said, the rest of the Chinese food here is pretty authentic and good!  The beef noodle soup had an extremely well flavored broth and the correct type of noodles, though the meat was a bit on the chewy side.  The seafood hot pot was very tasty too and had a good amount of shrimp, squid and tofu.  The stir fried bean curd with pork was pretty authentic too.  The restaurant itself was also full of Chinese clientele.

This restaurant has been added to my repertoire of Cleveland Chinese options.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am in love! I had suspicions this place would be great after the first Cleveland Night Market and I tried the squid. I highly suggest the mapo tofu if you're not 100% into eating an entire kabob meal. But I would totally be satisfied on the skewers of meat alone..... Don't judge! I've tried this place street food style, take out, and dine-in. All very satisfying  experiences!"}
{"text":"Another really enjoyable authentic Chinese place. I love that it features different regional specialties than other places in town. The signature lamb kebabs are nicely seasoned, but I found them a bit dry. Our other dishes were quite exceptional though. I'm looking forward to returning to try more new things."}
{"text":"Lamb skewers are flavorful and tender. These skewers are nothing like NYC street food, at least the one I had in times square. Fried rice can be eaten without adding soy sauce. This is going to be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Um you can't beat old school R&B and jazz, with a clean and simple defor, French pictures and downright delicious food at affordable prices."}
{"text":"Han Chinese Kabob & Grill is a restaurant that has potential, but could use some  improvement.  The decor and music in the restaurant is not typical of an Asian restaurant.  No scrolls with calligraphy and traditional Asian music - instead they play older American music and have old movie posters on the wall.  Good choice of Bose speakers.

My main criticism is in regard to the restaurant's kabobs.  Seeing \"Kabob\" in the restaurant's name, I had high expectations for this dish.  First, the kabobs took a long time to prepare.  My party ordered 2 dishes and the kabobs, which we assumed would be the appetizer.  Actually, the kabobs came out after we were finished with the first 2 dishes.  The beef kabobs we ordered were small - 6 for about $12.  Also, they weren't particularly tender or well seasoned.

The other 2 dishes were tasty.  A little on the salty side, but adequately spicy.  We ordered the spicy string beans and a dish with chicken and mixed vegetables.  The spicy string beans were my favorite - filled with spicy peppers, garlic, and ginger.  My party's chicken dish was tasty - nothing extraordinary, but good.  I could agree with a previous reviewer that the sauce tasted similar to what you find in the Asian supermarket, but I wasn't displeased with this dish.

If this restaurant works on its kabobs, I would give it 4 stars.  Also, I would advocate for more entrees from the grill.  But 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"We have been eating our way around Little Asia and this by far is my favorite restaurant.  The restaurant is clean and bright. The staff were friendly and helpful.  The crab rangoons are the best I've ever had. Shaped like triangles, you get filing in every bite. We also sampled the pot stickers. For lunch we had broccoli and shrimp, wood ear mushrooms and noodles, and filet with mushrooms. The food was extremely fresh and very good quality.  We had lots to take home as the portions were huge."}
{"text":"Very good food with very good service (although there was a bit of a language barrier). The food is well-prepared and well-seasoned. It was delicious, but can get a bit expensive if you're ordering food and kabobs. The area isn't the best part of town, but packed full of authentic cuisine. I enjoyed my time in this establishment and will come again. 
I met my wife here for lunch during the week and was seated immediately. We were given roasted nuts as a complimentary snack. Drinks were promptly brought out and our orders were taken when we were ready. The food took a little longer than I expected to come out, but it was worth the wait. I had a spicy beef soup and it was excellent. Only hesitation from giving out a 5 star review is amount of fat in my soup and the bit of waiting we had for the meals. 
I'll be back and if everything is smooth, I'll gladly bump up my review."}
{"text":"The food was subpar, greasy, and had some strange consistencies along with the takeout service leaving much to be desired. 

I ordered lunch and picked it up for colleagues. Once at the office we realized a colleagues lunch was missing but we were charged for it. When I called to speak with them about it the woman fought with me saying I was wrong even though I had my online receipt. They would not refund and wanted us to reorder and pay for it which we obviously wouldn't do. 

Will not order from here again."}
{"text":"So I found this place here on yelp and i must admit it was really nice. Ive been on a mission to find places that serve lamb for a min, so when i saw they had a free lamb skewer when u checked in I was like O TURN UP!! I was really happy lol. I went there and orderd sum lamb skewer with sum chicken fried rice. The place was nice and relaxing its a ideal place to go to with a friend or that speacial friend ;-). The people were really nice which was good. Ill def be back there"}
{"text":"We went there because we really wanted to try the kabobs. We ordered the lamb skewer and also the squid skewer. I liked the lamb skewer a lot, although it didn't come out as hot as I expected it to be. Almost tasted like they just heated it up and didn't make it fresh. We also checked in on Yelp to get a free skewer but the waitress didn't give us an extra and we had to ask her again about it. Although the flavor was good, it was too expensive for my taste. Other dishes were just standards. If you've never had Chinese lamb skewer, give it a try because the flavor is quite similar to what I had in China, but I personally probably won't go there again, unless I want to use the other free lamb skewer perk from Yelp lol"}
{"text":"Such delicious food! Great prices and really friendly wait staff! We ordered our food and it came out piping hot and within minutes. Very impressed with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I thought Arabs cooked the best kabobs until I tried some Chinese ones. The lamb kabobs were great and had a nice level of heat. They were more flavorful than Mediterranean lamb chunks on skewers. The menu is not as expansive as some Chinese restaurants in the immediate area. The food is consistently good. I have dined with different groups of people and each time every person left happy. I would like more Asian and Arab foods fused."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland. If you know and appreciate what traditional Chinese food is supposed to taste like, go here! Kung Pao chicken, stirfried eggplants, dry hot pot, and lamb kabob are among our favorite dishes. They have the edge on Szechuan Gourmet and Siam Cafe for my wife and I at the moment"}
{"text":"I guess I'm a fan.  I surprise myself sometimes.  i came here because of all the rave reviews about the kabobs when they first opened.  But to be honest, I wasn't a fan of the kabobs.  I only had the lamb -- but I only had 1 stick and gave up on it.

So of course, I had to order some of the other food off the menu to keep me fed.  And boy am I glad that I did!  Because I didn't even know that I liked it so much, until I realized that I just keep coming back!

Some of my favorites include the spicy string beans, and salt & pepper shrimp.  I've also had whole fish here, and I've had a couple of the ground pork dishes (I love wood ears and they aren't super common ingredients, so I love that I can always get it here).

They're open late, it's casual and easy.  There's never a wait, but there's always a few other tables eating.  It's a no fuss great Chinese restaurant that's authentic, affordable, and open all the time.  What more can you ask for.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in town. .Been there with my wife 4 time in the past 2 months. . The food is simply addicting! 
We tried the lamb skewers, beef skewers (6 skewers in each serving) - runs around 9-11 dollars. Loved it!  Marinated in traditional spices, they are mouthwatering! We also tried the grilled squid, can either get the body or the tentacles, each for 4 dollars. .I personally prefer the tentacles as they are a little crunchy.
My wife loved the chefs special noodles with wasabi sause. My favorite is the whole fish in bean sause with rice. About 18$ but worth the price. . It's a whole fish prepared with the right proportion of sweet and spicy that will surely titillate your taste buds. 
We are so happy to have found this place. Keep it up Hans!"}
{"text":"My friends and I, who love Asian food are on a mission to find new Asian bites. We heard all kinds of things about Han, so we decided to try it. 
There were a few things about this restaurant that everyone should know. First, there is a one line name for the food you choose. There is NO description of the food or the ingredients. If you have any allergies, BEWARE. 
Second, while I love authentic places, I have never been to a place where nobody on staff had a decent command of the English language. I get it, I'm an immigrant too. However, someone must be able to communicate effectively. As diners, we were flying blind!  The staff could not answer questions about ingredients. 
My friend has an egg allergy.  We ordered several dishes that from the name sounded safe, however when they arrived, they were loaded with egg.  Then we ordered again, and the order was incorrect.  It's frustrating. 
My dishes were actually very tasty, so I'm not down on this place entirely.  However, if you have allergies or dietary restrictions, pick another place. This will be hard to navigate."}
{"text":"Atmosphere- Standard Chinese restaurant decor. 

Service- A. The waitress was really patience with us and explained what ingredients we're in what dishes. 

Food- We got the eggplant green pepper mixed, Hang zho fried rice, spicy chicken, and a side of bao skewers. Everything tasted good so I recommend what we ordered. The only thing that was strange was the bao on skewers. It had the lamb spice dusted over the bao and kind of crunchy."}
{"text":"Sadly, we were visiting Cleveland from out of town so we only had one opportunity to visit.  However, it was wonderful.  Totally different than any other Asian food I've had.  Some dishes were like a combination of Korean and Japanese, others were flavored with cumin that they reminded me of certain Mexican cuisines.  The lamb skewers are spicy, but perfectly cooked.  We also enjoyed the Szechuan cold noodles and garlic pork.  Spicy, as requested.  Service was nice and it's a pretty place.

The only reason I didn't give the place five stars is that the servings are a little on the small side for the price - particularly on the noodle dish.  

But for someplace unique and different, but still Asian, it's a winner!"}
{"text":"My friend Johnny eats here two times a week. So I knew this place would be good. Also sampled their kabobs at the Cleveland Asian Festival. They had the longest lines all day so all those people can't be wrong. I got the Dan dan noodles and I enjoyed all the flavors it offered. Spicy but not overbearing and the noodles were very good, touch of meat and onions and the greens in the dish round it out well. It would be better if it was just a little bigger of a portion but I was full after the dish. The space is clean and modern. The waiter was very good. I'll be back here again to try more on their extensive menu."}
