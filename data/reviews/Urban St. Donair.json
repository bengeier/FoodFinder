{"text":"This place recently opened by our house, and my boyfriend and I were so excited as we have a slight obsession with donair. The place is super cute, it's decorated very nice and its so clean that you could literally eat off the floor. The owner is very friendly and you can tell that she really put a lot of thought and effort into her place. The food is great; we've tried the beef donair as well as the mixed chicken and beef donair. Both were fantastic. Really good and big size as well. My boyfriend, who eats more than he should actually couldn't finish his donair so I know if we ever come to this place, we won't leave hungry. There isn't that much of a selection to choose from and that's really my only complaint. I love baba ganoush and was disappointed that they didn't have that on the menu when majority, if not all donair places offer it. Either than that, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken shawarma poutine... drool!! Decided to try out this new place after seeing it on social media. Lovely mom and pop shop that is very clean with great service! Got the chicken shawarma and beef donair platters, and the falafel wrap. Platters were good but nothing special compared to the other shops. The poutine was the star dish for sure; comes with gravy, melty cheese, diced tomato, onion, parsley, succulent chicken pieces and we topped it with garlic sauce. Will return for the poutine."}
{"text":"What a great find last minute on the way to the airport, we had to grab poutine before leaving Canada eh?  Fiance got the pountine which was great and I was happily surprised by the massive plate of chicken schwarma.  The garlic and hot sauce was a nice addition.  Staff was quite friendly and the establishment was so fresh and so clean.  I'll definitely stop on my next trip through!"}
{"text":"SO good!! Super happy folks working inside, full of laughter and good ole fantastic customer service.   The food was fantastic. That garlic sauce was to die for.   Last...CLEAN! Everything looked fantastic.   I'll be back!   - North Haven Mom"}
{"text":"Got the mixed plate with chicken and beef on my first visit here. Food was super tasty and serving size was pretty decent. The mixed plate with an extra pita was $13.60 in total so it was a good deal. The only down side was that the meat was not really hot so there is room for improvement there. Overall I would suggest a visit and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Found a place better than Jimmy's! I ordered the large chicken shawarma and it was huge. The small order of grape leaves came with 6 good-sized rolls and I don't know what they do to their fries, but they're delicious.  It's like they have a light batter on them.  The price for all this was just over $20 and with free delivery from Skip the Dishes on orders over $20, it was an amazing deal! This has become my new go-to for shawarma sandwiches."}
{"text":"Just stopped by this place on the way to the airport yesterday.  These guys are super-friendly, the food is delicious, and the prices very reasonable!  I ordered the falafal wrap and it was really tasty.  An unexpected bonus was when they gave us some complimentary baklava!  Thank you!!  I wish I lived in the area.  I would definitely be a regular!"}
