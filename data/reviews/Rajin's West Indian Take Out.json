{"text":"Great Roti's! I've tried the Chicken and Goat. The Sahenas are amazing. The shop owner is also very lovely. Also well priced. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Call ahead so you don't have to wait! Curry Goat was good but had small portions. Would have liked a bit more meat in the wrap but overall it was delicious.

As for the Doubles.... they were amazing. I could have ate 6!! Haha. Top Notch 

I'll be back again"}
{"text":"I would not recommend the goat roti. The meat and potatoes were not cooked tender at all. There was more roti then filling. An overall disappointment. I still recommend the sahina and doubles as they are amazing."}
{"text":"Showed up and more than half the menu wasn't available... this included having no roti.  No idea what is going on here."}
