{"text":"Starting to perfect the use of chop sticks! Great End of Day specials here 3 for $15.00 which are pretty big containers and very filling. 

Lots of variety to choose from. I've tried the California Rolls, Spicy Crab Rolls, Crab Salad and the Yam Tempura Rolls and can vouch for their tastiness. Go with the variety pack in your choice of three. 

*Ask for extra soy sauce to go with your rolls."}
{"text":"I have only tried the maki roll (yam, avocado, cucumber- with tempura bits and spicy mayo+teriyaki) its TO DIE for. 
16 pieces for 14 dollars or so
really great:)"}
{"text":"On several occasions while at Dixie Mall, I spotted this quaint little sushi express though I didn't venture in. I'd sometimes see patrons consuming sushi in the food court, questioning the quality of their choice. On a more recent visit, I decided to give the place a try. I was craving sushi after all! They had deals ranging from 2-3 packs for $12 or $15. I went with two; a variety pack and spicy crispy salmon with brown rice. The sushi was pretty good though the rolls were fairly small. While I was deciding on which items to try, the chef was quickly rolling away in time for the dinner rush. At about 5pm, a crowd lined up to get their fix."}
