{"text":"We walked in on a whim to get some food to go.  The service was fast and the lady at the counter was really nice.  We got home to eat and the food was great!  We got the House Fried Rice, Wantons, Lo Mein, and Orange Tofu.  All fantastic!  We've been looking for a good Chinese food restaurant close by and it looks like the search is over.  Definitely coming back for our next craving."}
{"text":"Decided to try some Chinese food while visiting Phoenix and found this place on Yelp. The owners were extremely friendly. We ordered a family combo to feed 4 and it was more than enough food. The food was the best Chinese takeout we've had in years. It was extremely fresh and had tons of flavor. Definitely higher end quality food and would love to have them again!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service and great food for the value. I love supporting local businesses and this one is family owned and deserves to be tried. It's hard to find good Chinese in Phoenix and I would totally recommend this place! Coming back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Well I grew up in the Pacific North West where there are Teriyaki joints on every corner. This place is so clean and the food reminds me of my favorite fast food Chinese Restaurants growing up. The price is right the food is good and the place is so clean. Well worth going back can't wait to try their pork egg rolls"}
{"text":"Got a flier in my door but they don't deliver, no problem, went to pick up, place needs a facelift. But the whole plaza is a little dreary. Ordered general tso chx and orange chx. They both look and taste the same. I wonder if I got two of the same thing? Egg was good. Crab Rangoon's were small but there was 8 instead of some places that give u four big ones. Kinda curious what the kitchen looks like, with their stock of extra soda cans visible from the back side of the counter and a handwritten hours sign on the door. Was also hoping there's be a few pieces of carrot, onion or broccoli in the entrees but alas it was only fried chicken pieces sauced up."}
{"text":"I went in today to pick up a to go order and boy am I glad I found this place. I tried the Ma Po tofu and sesame chicken and it was sooooooo good, and the portions are huge. My boyfriend and I couldn't finish it. Also if you order $15 or more you get a free soda can, which was pretty neat. I highly recommend this place and cant wait to try more!"}
{"text":"We just tried this new place and I'm telling you - it has the best Mongolian beef I've had in years! Nice and spicy without hiding the flavor - the beef is really tender and not too chewy. The sweet and sour pork is fairly average, although fresh and not overdone. I'd never had crab rangoons before - and they were presented as a dessert - fried wontons with a really yummy cream cheese filling - delish! Really, really good take out Chinese. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place.  I've been there 4 times in 2 weeks.  The owners are very welcoming. The food is good and the prices are right.  I've enjoyed the shrimp (big shrimp) with lobster sauce, garlic shrimp (big shrimp), chicken egg foo yung, beef and broccoli, and mei fun.  Did I mention the shrimp is big?  That's always a ++++.  It's a small restaurant but the food is great!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We loved the food not to mention the service and prices! If you haven't given them a try you are definitely missing out!"}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone and stopped in to pick up. They got our order wrong (served us chicken instead of beef) but the food was so good we didn't even care. Jalape√±o chicken was spicy and delicious. The Mongolian beef was smokey and tender but very heavy on the onion. Just wish there had been more meat. 

I'll be back, soon, to check out the other options."}
{"text":"This takeout is a diamond in the rough! Delicious food, great prices!  

If you're a vegan, there's several dishes you'll love here: try the Vegetable Chop Suey, our favorite, or one of several tofu dishes, mixed vegetable, or noodle dishes.  

If not vegan, they have Chinese roast pork that is to die for, which we like in their house special egg foo young, which is loaded with lots of goodies on top.  And they have very affordable complete dinner combinations, all delicious and at amazing prices. 

See the menu photos, find your favorite, and take home today!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday lunch and was pleasantly surprised with the service and food.  We had Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, Mongolian Beef, Moo Goo Gai Pan and combination fried rice.  I would recommend, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"After returning home and seeing that my favorite Chinese food placed had closed, I was pleasantly surprised that a few weeks later this spot opened in its place. I hate to say this but the food is even better and the portions are HUGE!!! Their crab rangoon was stuffed to the gills and their boneless bbq ribs were plentiful and delicious. Oh and the rice? Yup equally delicious too. Needless to say I'm still doing a happy dance and I look forward to returning and trying numerous items from their menu."}
{"text":"Small family restaurant w/ great customer service 
Place is Mainly for takes outs, Good food very tasty. Definitely recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Had the Sesame chicken, nice texture full of flavor. Rice was nice and hot, all packaged in individual to go containers. Tasty food, not bad price! Great service! Great food!"}
{"text":"Great customer and you get allot of food for the price would.definitely plan on returning in the future"}
{"text":"Yi's Chinese is a Chinese Take Out Restaurant located in North Phoenix. This isn't a fancy restaurant and actually looks a little worn even though it's newly opened. When you walk in it appears that you order at the counter but on our visit the lady there told us to seat ourselves and she served us. They offer the usual lunch specials and the menu entrees come in small, large and extra large.

I tried the Szechuan Chicken. WOW! It was full flavored and SPICY! Not too sweet or salty either. It was packed with lots of nose running CHILI and Garlic and was DA BOMB! It was delicious! It also was packed with lots of masterfully prepared super tender chicken that melted in my mouth.

My husband tried the Hunan Beef. For me it wasn't as complex and full of flavors as the Szechuan but I think it was made the way it is suppose to be. It tasted like soy sauce and was made with black bean paste. It also wasn't as spicy. My husband said the beef was ok.......for me it was not nearly as good as the chicken. (but I am picky that way)

I have to say the Szechuan Chicken at Yi's Chinese Restaurant was MIGHTY Flavorful and Spicy! The Chicken also was Masterfully Prepared. (not crappy or bland like most places in North Phoenix) The large is a very big portion and I thought I had a meal for latter but the Dang Food was so delicious my husband Scarfed it up!

Yi's Chinese is now a new favorite and will be on my local rotation.

Thank you for bringing something delicious to North Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, very reasonable.  It is a strip mall store with paper plates and plastic forks."}
{"text":"Was going back and forth on which local fast food take out to order from ...well passing by Yi's on several occasions and reading the yelp reviews helped me into making my mind up. I do like how you are able to order online or call in your order. They do now have a delivery method, so it is by pick up only and pay when you pick up. Menu is reasonably priced from other fast food places. I went with my typical fried rice and spare ribs tips! 
Just by the smells of the food I was bought in and excited to try the food. Once I made my plate I was thrilled by the authentic flavors that made me an instant fan! I can now say that this fast food Chinese take out is my go to from now on!"}
{"text":"All good-- friendly service. Place looked clean. I picked up takeout today for lunch.  I had the house special fried rice and boneless bbq pork - Beth tasty. I will go back again and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Food is freshly made.  The cashier is very friendly.  The interior could use some refreshing.  Good, solid take out place."}
{"text":"After seeing the high praise for this Asian restaurant, we took a drive.  Staff welcomed us as we walked in.  The place was empty except for one person waiting for takeout.  That is always a bit scary.  The place is spotless with little decor.  We ordered the shrimp with lobster sauce and chicken with garlic sauce which is spicy. We asked the staff to tone down the spicy level.  She mentioned it was sweet, sour and spicy to make sure he like that taste.  The meals come with fried rice and egg rolls.  If you spend over $15 for your meal, you get a free bottled water or soft drink.  
Several minutes later, our egg rolls came out piping hot.  They were advertised as pork egg rolls and had small bits of pork inside.  The meals were delivered to us shortly after that.  Plenty of food.  I would have rather had white rice.  There were 6 shrimp which is ample.  The sauce was decent although my father made a better version.  The spicy level of the chicken was perfect so we were glad we asked that it be adjusted.  Overall, it is not bad or great.  Plenty of parking in the Strip. 
We are still looking for a favorite Asian place.  We come from San Francisco and know that will be a challenge."}
{"text":"On our 5th time since opened. Owners are from the east coast and it shows. It has been the best chinese food we've had since NY chinese food. So far everything has been good. Highly recommend this little place. Super nice, really try hard to please, hope it continues. Fresh paint, pictures, electronic monitor menus. We've eaten in and ordered for pickup. Always include extra on larger orders. Great go to place."}
{"text":"Not impressed! The hot and sour soup was a disappointment as was the General Tso chicken, it was over cooked and the coating was hard. I had the shrimp with garlic which was OK. What I especially didn't like was styrofoam cups for water, and no refills; and flimsy plastic forks and plates. And the soup is not served in a bowl, it came in a plastic container and we were given two Styrofoam bowls and had to pour the soup into them. Since the soup was scalding hot husband had to use several paper napkins wrapped around the container to keep from burning his hand! I can understand that Chinese restaurants do lots of take out but when you have an area for people to order off the menu and eat in they should have some decent dishes and cutlery! And to top it off my husband got sick during the night. His food poisoning lasted twenty four hours plus!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in Phoenix. Everything delicious. Have to try the chili oil. 
It's a must!!!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by its location or bare-bones setup. Yi's Chinese Restaurant actually offers up some really good Chinese food for the area. Far better than what one would expect.

The menu is fairly traditional in terms of American-Chinese cuisine. Everything you're probably familiar with is found here. I decided to try their orange chicken while my girlfriend opted for the chicken lo mein. Combination plates come with an eggroll and fried rice, but you can modify and add noodles as an alternative if you wish to do so.

For 7.95 per combination plate, the portions are generous and the quality of what you get is far better than what you'd typically find for North Phoenix. Takeout is common, but we chose to dine-in. 

Chinese has always been a bit of a risk for us, with many places just barely being able to pass as acceptable. Fortunately, that's definitely not the case here. I look forward to going back and experimenting with some of their other offerings.

Highly recommended for some cheap eating Chinese!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I've had in Phoenix, by far. The fried rice and lo mein are really good, normally I find them boring at other places. Kung Pao, Szechuan, and hunan dishes are delicious and actually spicy. Orange chicken is crispy and yummy. The food's always fresh and hot. The family meal for 4 is an outstanding bargain for $22. My family of 3 can eat 2 to 3 meals each from it. The restaurant is kept impeccably clean, bathroom too. We're very happy they opened so close to our house. The owners are a young couple, so hopefully it'll be here for many years to come.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"By far the BEST Chinese food in Arizona that I've tried. Their food is always hot and fresh, also always so sweet when you walk into the door. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and quick service. Honesty the best fast food Chinese meal I've had since moving from NY.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant that's close to my place, after trying a few different spots, I think I finally found my go to. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Food and service is excellent !!  Love the pepper steak, pork egg rolls and the fried won tons- best Chinese restaurant in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Wow!  Very impressed with Yi's restaurant. Friendly and welcoming , clean and tidy, really reasonable prices and food is very good.  It is a surprise to get lunch for $6 and have it taste good and fresh. We got fried rice, hunan beef and egg roll. I definitely will be back as I am looking forward to trying all of my favorites. I am sure they will not disappoint me."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place seems to so empty all the time... Maybe it's just brand new? In any case- GREAT lunch specials ($5.95 -- less than $10 for dinner). The food is always hot, fresh, and cooked promptly to order. Friendly service to boot."}
{"text":"This place is so good! And they are super nice love it!! I'm gonna come back !!!!!!!---!!"}
{"text":"This place is our new \"go to\". We've recently been looking for a good Chinese spot and we finally found it! Good portions at a good price and the food is ALWAYS fresh. Service is good and location kicks ass! (Right down the street from us ) if you're in the area, drop in."}
{"text":"The food here was great. Really the best I have found in the Phoenix area. The atmosphere not much but everything we tried was top notch. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"So I visited Yi after seeing everyone's review about how great the food is. It's a newer spot so I thought one night after craving Chinese food why now. To start with the positive the overall service was great, the server was friendly and took the time to take my older. I was a little indecisive, I wanted it all. The food is pretty affordable and I got a pretty good serving size. The one thing and I don't know if it's because of the time of day I visited but my order of the General Tso was a little dry and I felt like I had more crunch than soft meat. I will definitely have to visit again to see if my experience was the same. 

While I ordered for a takeout they have a lot of space for you to eat there but this place seemed more like the take out kind of place. 

If you're looking for a cheap takeout option this is definitely a place to checkout."}
{"text":"Seriously the best Chinese restaurant in town!! I've tried 9 different places in moving here in the last year. Highly recommend this place! Great service and food second to none!"}
{"text":"I've been in Phoenix,AZ for 5 years now. This place has been the best I've tried since I been in here. Very clean on the inside, great atmosphere, great conversation. I got the boneless bbq spear ribs lunch plate and a side order of chicken wings. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great for a quick dinner with the family. Good food and reasonable prices. Very friendly service too. Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Came in today since the place has good reviews. I wasn't disappointed at all. The place is cute and super clean. The owners were super nice. I ordered the combo general tso chicken. Packed with flavor and a crunch. Gave me a lot of fried rice and a egg roll. Will be coming back to try more items!"}
{"text":"Small place but really good food. Hostess was very nice and made recommendations. Spice level was just right and quantity was ample."}
{"text":"Went today really hoping the hype was all that....turned out not to be the case. The service was great, but the food not so much. I definitely do not recommend the hot and sour soup. Couldn't even eat it. Tasted greasy and unlike any other hot and sour soup I've had anywhere. Wish the rice was better, but my teenaged boys did like the orange chicken. We won't be back. What a bummer."}
{"text":"The resturaunt is clean ,  the staff is friendly and the food is great ! They give you good position sizes at a good price"}
