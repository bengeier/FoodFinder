{"text":"I'm moving back to Nova Scotia next week and this pizza will be missed dearly. There's nothing like it. Simply amazing."}
{"text":"The pizza is extraordinary; they are very generous with the toppings and especially the cheese. Order beer, don't order the wine. If you want to hang out to watch a game or shoot pool, do it in the afternoon or early evening."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fantastic Delivery! We Love Atlas Pizza!"}
{"text":"I love Atlas Pizza. It is so satisfying and delicious, with tonnes of cheese which is a bit crispy on the top.  The sauce on the pizza is one of the best I tasted. When my friend was visiting from Ireland, this was the #1 spot I had to take her to (she loved it).  

They recently renovated it, and put it many booths, which is my fave type of seating in a bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried atlas pizza at work a few weeks ago. Nasty pizza I say. The layers of toppings on each other make it taste gross. Too many toppings in top of each other isn't the way to make it taste good."}
{"text":"UNIMPRESSED
Staying the night in Calgary and was suggested this place by a local.  After comparing menu options and pricing with similar nearby pizza places, we decided to place an order for pickup from the \"take out menu\" option on their website:
- 1 large atlas special pizza $24
- 1 Caesar salad for one $7.50
- 1 order Greek chicken wings $9

As we were placing that order by phone we were told \"hold on\" and cut off, mid order!
After waiting a minute while the order taker talked to someone else we were told our order would be ready in 30min.

35 minutes later our pickup order was ready.  We did inquire if they would offer a pickup discount as the other 2 local competitors do?  they were completely offended, and rudely stated that their \"volume is too high to even entertain that idea\".

Upon returning to our place of stay with dinner we discovered that the wings were not included and that they charged us almost $52...

We called and were told we would get extra wings next time and that prices have gone up.  We mentioned that were out of town so next time would not work.  After asking a few times for wings to be delivered to us (1 block away), Atlas finally conceded by saying they would deliver when they could.

Wings did arrive within about 10 minutes, slightly warm. Pizza was decent but not worth the new price of $27+ and the half Caesar salad consisted of lettuce, 10 croutons, powder/dry Parmesan and dressing for, I'm guessing , $10.

NOT IMPRESSED by a this local joint...
 Service = POOR 
 Food = MEDIOCRE
 Prices = NOT AS POSTED, PRICEY

Will NOT return and our poor experience will be told of when we make home.
Additionally, our local friend will no longer recommended or provide patronage to Atlas."}
{"text":"Pizza is Old school I love it! lots of Cheese, god toppings, good service, good prices for a local bar. Draft beer kinda tastes funny all the time so I suggest bottles."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to watch a Flames game. I had the same pizza each time, the Madigan, and it was very good. Reminded me of other long standing pizza spots in Calgary like Greco and Hanni's in the SW. Both times I found the service really friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Would not go back service was mediocre tried to get the attention of the waitress was wanting to play ntn but was ignored the pizza wasn't great so for a first time wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"Second time here. Ordered a pizza. Never actual got it. Waitress response \" oh sorry that one was my fault\". Wonder if she thought I should have been responsible for her not entering our order. Going to think twice now about going there."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza ever! We order delivery from here at least once a week! Always good always fast!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, the perfect place to watch football in Calgary.

The specials are great and in my opinion the best pizza in Calgary. The restaurant is covered in TV's so you never miss a game
On Sunday."}
{"text":"DUMP DUMP DUMP! We used to go here and also order pizza which USED to be good. The food - pizza is horrible. The staff have all gone down hill. WE will NEVER spend another cent here and never order from here again.  The lowlife with the Man Bun is arrogant and rude. Get rid of him! I can see why the clientele had dove to the depths of no return.  GROSS"}
{"text":"Atlas pizza is a little hidden gem. This pizza place has been one of my all time favourites, the portions are large, the prices are fair, and the cheese they use is phenomenal. The pizza is cooked to perfection every time I place an order, but, keep in mind that if you are going to do delivery, the wait times are long and tedious and the pizza typically comes soggy. I would 100% recommend their pizzas that they offer. :)"}
{"text":"Love it! Great pizza and drink! Great service. Wish it was bigger 'cos it was bigger, but the service was perfect."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek-style pies in the city. Love the crusty cheese and the touch of Cinnamon in the sauce. I drive across the city for this pie."}
{"text":"Atlas Pizza and Sports Bar is one of those places where, if you go often enough, everybody would know your name. There is a colourful mix of patrons, including the regulars that frequent this friendly neighbourhood fixture, chatting up the servers and catching up on the day's news and gossip. Atlas is a huge space, perfect for finding your own corner and just relaxing, listening to tunes or watching the game. The bar is long with plenty of seating and a decent selection of beer on tap for those wanting that ice cold reward after an honest day's work.

Let's get to the main reason we're here...the pizza, after all, it is a Pizza and Sports Bar. Don't expect to find a Napoli style thin-crust artisan creation with the supporting documentation from the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana. It's also not a Chicago style deep dish square of dough piled with ludicrous amounts of toppings and greasy cheese that's slides apart like a perverted game of meat jenga after the first bite either. This is a solid, no-nonsense pie, complete with a very good selection of fresh toppings that you can find in most places that offer the same thing.

The difference comes with the execution. The dough is fantastic, resulting in a crust that is uniformly baked and evenly crispy, thanks to the perforated pans that the pizzas are baked in. Toppings are not over-used. They are a healthy and sensible proportion to the rest of the ingredients, including the cheese, which is also evenly cooked, extending all the way to the edge. There are not a lot of places where I can eat a slice of pizza and eat the whole thing, including the crust. Atlas is a place where I can truly say that I can.

Great pizza and cold beer. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious pizza ever, and at an affordable rate!!!
 They've literally been around FOREVER (my mom celebrated her 18th bday there 30 years ago and I celebrated mine there last year!) And the pizza hasnt changed!
 They also serve a wide variety of drinks and other foods, yet again at an affordable rate!
 Not the type of place you would want to get all fancy and dressed up for to go on a first date... Much more of a take-out scenario! But still absolutely worth going in to get!"}
{"text":"The absolutely best pizza in Calgary. I like their Hawaiian, and loaded pizzas. They put a ton of toppings on their pizzas, so generally one large is filling enough for a family. It is best to order delivery from them, as the actual location is a sports bar, and can be a little seedy.
 
The only downside is that it is a little expensive though with so many other cheaper options."}
{"text":"I grew up a couple blocks away from Atlas. I can't believe I went so long without trying out this place. The pizza is amazing! The toppings are generous and the service is always top notch."}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years. Pizza is fantastic, rest of menu is good also. With the New renos tv's are abundant great place to watch game"}
{"text":"Best darn pizza around. I love the way they have a nice thick layer of cheese on top of generous toppings, and how they make the top of the cheese crunch and golden. We always order the #3 - mushrooms, peperoni & green peppers. This pizza is too good --- i have to brainwash myself NOT to order it too often!"}
{"text":"Any one who doesnt like Atlas pizza is a communist, or a racist! Well maybe not that bad, but they definitely arent people I associate with!
Go get a pizza and a pint, totally worth it! Ask to sit in Dorothys section, shes the best"}
{"text":"Before moving away from Calgary 8 years ago, Atlas was one of my favorite hang outs for food, service, and all around atmosphere. Was visiting again recently and was so happy to see that things have not changed. The pizza and wings were excellent as usual,  and service was just as good. Dot, Alyssa, and Christine were all rock stars and a good example of professional service on a busy night. Kudos for keeping up with standards, even after so many years!"}
{"text":"I've been to atlas a few times.   The environment is nice, great place to watch sports.   Everyone really gets into it.   There are pool tables.   Great pizza and tasty tasty drinks.   Yum!"}
{"text":"These guys have the BEST pizza in town, hands down. It's an old school place in the hood but it's honestly the best pizza around. I have friends I grew up from Marlborough and they always talk about how awesome it is. Now considering I've always been told it's the best! My expectations were extremely high, well I was not disappointed. Ask me about the service..... Don't even remember lol I do and our server was great but I was instantly in loved and have become a fan. All I got to say is I leave in the deep south and the drive is a non issue at this point.
Atlas Pizza you're the best!"}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype for this place in the pizza they bring to the table. I love cheese as much as the next non-vegan, but this was kind of ridiculous. I took this pizza home as takeout, and when I looked at it at home there was a centimeter thick layer of cheese along the top of the pizza. The crust and sauce and toppings were all otherwise quite delicious, so I can't get past the cheese. There must have been a pound of cheese alone on this pizza. The wings on the other hand, were quite good for takeout."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh !! Food is great ! Service sucked so bad.
Even when I called to talk to manager ...they don't give a crap 
If you're too busy to give good service, hire more staff
So disappointed 
I will never go back & I love supporting the little businesses...."}
{"text":"The pizza here is legendary. Great Greek-style pizza that's delicious and filling.

To be honest, I've never eaten anything here *but* the pizza (except for the zucchini sticks as an appie which also make the cut) but if it's anything like the pizza, I'm sure it's great.

Atlas also has a decent selection of beer (don't look for anything out of the ordinary) wine and spirits (including some Greek ones I haven't seen elsewhere).

It's probably also the least in-your-face sports bar I can think of. Tons of TVs, all showing different games and sports but without the dull roar of the sattelite feed drowning out your conversation.

If you're in, or close to the NE, Atlas makes a great \"something for everyone\" kind of spot."}
{"text":"I helped some friends move the other day with promise of beer and pizza in exchange for labor.  Luckily for us, they moved pretty close to Atlas Pizza!  We ordered a few pizzas and wings for the group of us.  My friend was talking up Atlas quite a bit, and once the pizza arrived I understood why!  

I find a lot of pizza places have one great aspect..either the crust, or cheese or toppings.  Atlas had nailed all 3, if only one complaint, there was too much cheese.....is that even a real complaint??

Delicious deep crust, a great proportion of toppings and a thick layer of cheese topped off the pies.  Delicious pizza!  Could only have a couple pieces, it was really heavy.  But delicious.

The wings we got were really good too.  Salt and pepper wings were the best, although the hot and the Thai chili held their own.  

If friends are moving again, I am in as long as they are moving near Atlas!  I will have to actually go to the bar and review again!"}
{"text":"Awful awful experience. I ordered delivery... the order arrived at my door very quickly, about 15 minutes after I placed the call.
We ordered just appetizers as we weren't starving but wanted something good to munch on. We got the Pita Platter $10, two dozen wings (12 teriyaki, 12 salt & pepper) $9/each, an order of zucchini sticks ($9)  and 6 pack of ginger ale. 
First off, the pita platter was a box of very thick cut triangle pitas... that were covered in huge chunks of garlic, parmesan cheese and parsley.... with 4 tiny dips.... tzaziki, spinach X 2, and hummus.
One bite of the pita and my mouth was on fire from the huge chunks of garlic .... disgusting ! And I love garlic. The pita was also very dry and crunchy... not what a pita is suppose to be like. All 4 dips were ice cold and nasty. Bland. Yuck. 
Then the zucchini sticks... they were hot.... but, a bite and I got a squirt of grease in my mouth ... the zucchini was mushy and the batter was soggy. Gross. The ranch dressing that comes with smelled like it had gone sour... just gross.
Our appetites were instantly gone.
I will say .. the wings were good. Cooked great... sauced up and crunchy. 
The cans of  ginger ales were also good.
I called in and complained. I told them I'd keel the ginger ales and the two orders of wings... but I wanted the rest picked up and my money refunded. 
The driver showed back up.... and handed me a $20 bill.
I paid $55. I don't kno how it cost me $35 for two orders of wings and a 6 pack of pop.
I'm pissed. And won't order from them ever again. Bad customer service and nasty food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for pizza while visiting a friend. There were not many veggie options unfortunately, but although very greasy, the pizza was ok. Looks like a decent sports bar for big groups."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizzza, best in town"}
{"text":"The pizza reminded me of the stuff I used to get in the pub back home in small town Alberta. Nothing fancy with the toppings, just 33 variations of cheese, onion, mushroom, pineapple, pepperoni, tomato, green pepper beef, ham-you know, the way North American pizza used to be. An Italian sausage or Greek pizza are about as out there as you'll get here. And it's pretty gosh darn tootin' tasty.

The bar itself is big, there's plenty of room and lots of TVs for you to catch some of that there playoff action. Caesars are on special ($3.95) on Thursdays, combine that with happy hour until 7 and you've got yourself a decent little hang out for the first half of the night."}
{"text":"Food is great had a few different items, but love the pizza, greasy but great with an alcoholic beverage!! Has pool tables, and can get pretty busy !!"}
{"text":"Did it just get manly in here? Atlas pizza is a man's pizza.This pizza doesn't mess around. This pizza's got BALLS. In fact, instead of a man flexing on the front of the box they should just have a giant pair of nuts because this is the kind of pizza that puts hair on your chest and lowers your voice by a few octaves.

I had Atlas' pizza delivered to a networking event I was at. I had never heard of them before, so I was initially leery of this mystery pizza. That is, before the pizza jumped out of the box and roundhouse kicked my taste buds into the year 2013, post-apocalypse. All that I saw was molten lava and dead bodies. 

What makes this pizza so manly? Well imagine the girliest pizza you can - thin, dainty, ornate. Now, reverse that, blow your own mind and imagine the manliest pizza you can. A thick bad boy with toppings piled high and more cheese than you should be able to comfortably digest. When you pick it up, your arms get a little work out. Be prepared - you're going to get a thin layer of grease on your hands - as if you'd been repairing a tank or something. Just roll with it. 

I ravenously devoured many flavors of pizza - Hawaiian, Pepperoni, Vegetarian and some other flavor that I can't even recall because by that point I was so full of testosterone I was sucker punching innocent bystanders for no good reason. The portions are large enough to feed a small army of hungry, sweat drenched coal mill workers.

This is the kind of pizza that you eat after a day spent doing push ups and flexing. This is the kind of pizza that probably comes delivered via Harley Davidson. This is the kind of pizza that the great men of history would have demanded after building the pyramids and charting the high seas.

I ate this pizza until the laws of physics deemed it impossible to cram any more pizza into my body without spontaneously combusting.

Ladies, you CAN eat this pizza too. Just don't be horrified if you start sprouting a little bit of a beard and suddenly get an urge to play Call of Duty.

For best effect, pair with beer. Any beer. Preferably, pour beer from a keg and crush the cup when you're done. Wear flannel and jeans you don't mind rubbing your hands on - because napkins are for wussy babies.

And for heaven's sake, finish your crust. If you defile this pizza by throwing the crust away you deserve to be punted so hard in the nether regions that you feel it in your nostrils.

I give this pizza four biceps out of a possible 5."}
{"text":"I LOOOOVE. Their Hawaiian. The toppings taste amazing! The dough is always perfect. Some times you have to wait a bit but it's %100 worth it."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I wish there was more beer options on tap but other then that its a good place to relax with some buddies."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 20 years. Nothing in town compares to it. Great place for pizza. Lots of topping choices. They're very little liberal on the cheese and taste great. Decor/ ambiance needs some work but hey its a sports bar so no dress code needed. Highly recommended, reasonable prices too. I've introduced this to my gf and she loves it."}
{"text":"First time there and it was an awesome experience, definitely will be back again. The service was above average , the food and drinks were excellent!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite pizza restaurants in Calgary! The greek pizza is delicious, and very filling! The crust is perfect, and the way the layer the meat is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've never dined in until today since they are always busy....specially after work and close to weekends.

Since it got renovated maybe a year or 2 now....the decor is really nice very inviting and comfy.

Now my hubby is very very picky. He hates eating out. When we went was around mid afternoon so there were a handful of patrons only.

You go in...choose your seat. The server came really fast.  Drinks order.

I ordered steak and spaghetti for $20 
Hubby had 10 oz steak with mashed potatoes and gravy for $25
Coffee and iced tea for drinks ( it's in a medium jug with free refills) I was full of iced tea...

The overall experience is perfect..."}
