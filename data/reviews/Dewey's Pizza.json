{"text":"It's hard to tell this place is a franchise.  It blends seamlessly into the classic Lakewood Detroit Rd storefronts.  The house salad's cranberry thingies taste like delicious bits of candy (better than Craisins even though the waitress said that's exactly what they are).  You can never go wrong with one of their calzones.  They're a perfect size and price to fill you up at anytime; completely packed with flavor, yet has that healthy non-grease-drenched composition.  If you can, dine in - they keep your sodas topped off like they're getting paid by the refill."}
{"text":"First time for me and my son to try Dewey's and I have to say I was very impressed! Had a little issue and I let my server know, she not only took care of it but let the manager know also. He came out to our table and went above and beyond to make it right and to be honest you don't see that kind of customer serves anywhere any more so great job in getting a faithful customer!! I thought the pizza was great,  going in I knew it was pricey but I got what I paid for. A great pizza with fresh ingredients.  So thank you fairlawn Dewey's I will definitely be back, and recommend!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dewey's twice and it's some of the best pizza I've had in Ohio. If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, there will probably be a long wait but when I went on a Sunday evening it was quieter. They have options for custom pizzas or the most excellent specialties. Just wow. Lots of really perfectly curated and interesting toppings. My favorite has a bunch of mushrooms, big chunks of garlic, and capers. Mm."}
{"text":"First the good
Prompt and Friendly service
Nice beer selection

Now the bad
The pizza

After reading reviews and hearing stories about how good this place was suppose to be all I can say is my brother and I were extremely underwhelmed. The sauce tastes cheap, the cheese tastes cheap, the crust is closer to dough than crust, and while charging an outrageous price. Now if it were priced more closely to how the quality of it tastes it wouldn't be so bad but when your charging Papa John prices you better have something on par if not better. I've had better pizza from the freezer section of a grocery store at a fraction of the price. It's really sad because I really wanted to like this place virtually everything else was good but the one thing it's suppose to specialize in it completely misses the mark."}
{"text":"If you like New York style pizza, this is a good place to go. The pizza is wonderful.     They have a huge window so that you can see into the kitchen and watch them make pizza. Sometimes if you get lucky, the guy throwing the dough might take flour and throw it at the glass. When you come in it's  usually crowded. After you're seated the service is always great.  We usually get a salad. Our favorite salad is the Candied Walnuts and Grape. After a while your pizza is served to you. We really like the Bronx Bomber. We also get a spinach artichoke pizza. You can get half of your pizza one way and the other half another way."}
{"text":"Nice pizza spot on Lee Road. Greek salad was good, although it doesn't come with the traditional Greek dressing.  Their house Greek dressing was a roasted red pepper version...it was still good though.  We ordered extra cheese on our pizza and it turned out to be too much!  The dough at the bottom wasn't fully cooked.  Won't hold it against them though...just noting here in case someone else orders extra cheese.  Pizza had a great taste, customer service was great...would return if back in town."}
{"text":"This pizza. Just wow. Everything is fresh. The house salad is fantastic (and free for downloading the app).  

Will definitely hit this place again when I come back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"I was a bit leery of trying Dewey's pizza because it's a chain and not local, and there are enough local pizza and meal options including the excellent Angelo's. Nevertheless, after reading numerous reviews of how great their pizza is, what fresh ingredients, what good dough etc.  I decided to try them for takeout.  I don't think they deliver, which is a negative given that they are located in a busy block of restaurants/ bars that is often all parked up, but I wouldn't knock off a star just for that. 

Although I wouldn't call Dewey's website very user-friendly in terms of ordering (no build-your-own options, no crust options, and I even had to hunt around for the phone number of the location to call in my order), the interesting pizza combinations they offered were appealing, offering a number of fresh veggie choices and none of the weird \"taco seasoning on a pizza\" or \"mac n cheese on a pizza\" or \"nachos on a pizza\" gunk.  I was pretty thrilled to see the Wild Mushroom pizza on their menu because we have mushroom pizza fans in the house and the Wild Mushroom pizza features several varieties of fresh shrooms, rather than the sad little handful of un-fresh canned shrooms you often get on a \"mushroom\" pizza. 

So, after putting in my order, I drove down to pick it up. You enter down a hallway and at the end there's a \"Please wait to be seated\" sign and no indication of where you pick up takeout, but it's apparently the bar as that's where I went and paid and then the tender calls the kitchen to bring my order out.  After a couple minutes wait, out it came.  When the box was placed in my hands it was not terribly hot, and during my 7 to 10 minute drive back to where I was staying in the West End I grabbed a piece at a stoplight and it was lukewarm...and by the time I got it into my kitchen it was verging on cold.  I ended up having to heat pieces up in the microwave which caused the dough, which already seemed a tad underdone (thin, white and un-crispy) to go rather gooey.  The whole thing probably should have been shoved into an oven and baked an additional 5 minutes but people were hungry and didn't want to wait.  I will say the ingredients were fresh and the veggies were flavorful and the combinations were tasty but...it was like eating semi-raw dough with olive oil and toppings and a hint of cheese, and if not reheated it was cold semi-raw dough to boot. 

Side note:  Make sure you read the ingredients to see if something as basic as red pizza sauce is going to be on your pizza because some of Dewey's creations don't have it.  I was OK with this at least from an experimental standpoint, but my dinner partner expected a pizza to have the basics of dough, cheese AND sauce and objected strenuously to its omission on the Wild Mushroom pizza.  Sadly, there does not seem to be a menu option to add things like sauce to the set selections.  I don't know if they'd do it if you asked, but I'd just as soon not have to hassle around with special requests, especially when the set menu item isn't even coming out hot.  Pizza's supposed to be easy...

Finally, a word about the sit-down part of the restaurant.  We didn't eat in, figuring it would be too crowded and maybe full of kids and families on a weekend night.  For some reason it was only about half full but even so, the only appealing part of this restaurant to sit in was at the bar.  The rest of the place looked like my college cafeteria.  In a town where 100 restaurants and bars are competing with each other, who wants to eat in a big boring space?  Based on other reviews I was thinking you'd maybe get to see the Dewey's cooks tossing dough like Shakeys, but there wasn't much of a sight line to the kitchen window, and nothing visible through it at all. 

Not horrible, but I don't think I'll bother going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Service is incredible! Food is awesome! Get there at the right time and you dont have to wait too long. :)"}
{"text":"I forgive this place for being a chain because of the high quality ingredients and lots of fun topping options. The Greek salad has this fantastic roasted red pepper dressing. My only complaint is they won't make breadsticks (believe me, I've asked)."}
{"text":"I've gone to Dewey's for years, and I have yet to be disappointed! The best part of going there, hands down, are the servers. They're always helpful and cheerful, overall a delight to do business with.

As far as the food, I am a fan of the Dr. Dre (Olive oil, Mozzarella Cheese, Green Peppers, Red Onions, Amish Chicken, Bacon, and Jalapenos with Diced Tomatoes and Ranch after the bake). Yes, ranch may sound weird for a pizza, but it is so good, especially with that extra kick of spice from the jalapenos. Another good pizza is the Ryan's Inferno (Olive Oil, Mozzarella Cheese, Buffalo Chicken, Gorgonzola Cheese, Red Onion with Ranch Dressing and Celery after the Bake). It is by far one of the best cheese combos I've ever had on a pizza, and once again, do not underestimate the usage of ranch on a pizza.

I have to agree with some of the below comments: my only true hang up here is that there are a lot of little kids usually in the restaurant. It can be awfully noisy, although the servers do a good job cleaning up after them."}
{"text":"I ordered the Edgar Allen Poe which was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. It was packed and kind of uncomfortable dining in but the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Nice salads to choose from. Any kind of pizza you can think of.

Parking may be an issue."}
{"text":"I had the blueberry almond salad that was amazing. The berries were very fresh. Had a half Hawaiian and half Cuban pizza. The Cuban was a summer special and was terrific. The hand toss crust was perfect. The service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here for the first time last night and we both loved it! And he is quite the critic! We each got a side salad to start which was delicious and a great size. We then did a medium pizza half Meatball half Dr.Dre, it was wonderful! The staff was super friendly and they have great taste in music because we loved the iPod that they were playing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I expected more of certain specialty pizzas -- some of the topping combinations have left me underwhelmed, and I can never remember which ones I love and hate by the time I return (all of the ingredients sound so good on paper, just not always in person).  Whenever I've created my own pizza I've enjoyed them (they make a very nice white pizza), particularly their crust and lack of greasiness, and tend to go that route to be safe.

However, their salads have never disappointed me.  The portions are huge (even the \"side\" size), and they use beautiful fresh greens (none of that iceberg lettuce crap).  My favorites are the Candied Walnut & Grape and the seasonal Strawberry & Macadamia Nut, but even the house salad far exceeds the expectations I usually reserve for specialty salads (pine nuts, cranberries, and goat cheese make it a quality blend).  They're great for take out and even a quick lunch, if not for dinner.

Both the pizzas and salads incorporate creative, high quality blends of ingredients.  They even go as far as separating \"regular\" and \"gourmet\" toppings on their menu.

The service in Lakewood has always been very attentive.  My brother likes to stop at Dewey's around his birthday, and they always give him a complimentary logo glass to take home.  When they've made an error in my table's order, or something hasn't been to our liking (only a few times), they've made an entirely new pizza for us to take home, even if we've insisted not to go to the trouble.

The only bad experience I've had at Dewey's was a few months ago, when someone at my table pointed out an excessive amount of dust along some of the table fixtures, and the manager argued with the her (even though she could plainly see the dust), maintaining that the staff cleans everything daily.  The manager could have been much more diplomatic and receptive to the criticism.  Otherwise, everything has been great.  I feel bad that it often seems to be empty when I pass by."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town. Kids will love standing by the kitchen window, where the pizza makers fling flour at the glass and make funny faces. The pizza selection is excellent and creative, and the salads are great. The pizzas have a thin crust that is always baked to perfection-- light and airy crust and never burned on the bottom. One minor quibble is that I like my ingredients baked under the cheese, but Dewey's opts to put them on top. The beer selection is decent, and they scored major points when they had Abita Amber on draft leading up to Mardi Gras!"}
{"text":"Great salads. Great place to take friends or family. Pizza is good too. But forget all that.... just take one thing away from this review: the Service. Every resteraunt in this price range should model their service off of Dewey's."}
{"text":"If you're ever in Cleveland Heights looking for some place to find lunch you'll likely be disappointed to find the majority of the places on this stretch of the neighborhood don't open until 4pm. 

Luckily Dewey's the exception to that. 

Top notch, made to order pizza & a decent selection of craft beer, I was very happy the wife & I popped in on a recent visit."}
{"text":"Ordered a really basic pepperoni pizza, but it was everything I could want and more. Just the right amount of sauce, cheese and meat.

Dewey's also has some of the best crust. Crunchy, but not too crunchy.

We dined in and our server was exceptionally friendly."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant family dinner here -- one that I'm sure my kids will talk about for weeks. That's because of the large windows through which you can watch the cooks prepare the pizzas. The cooks will put on a show for the kids.

As for the food, you can get pizza featuring all the usual toppings and a number of gourmet ingredients. The crust is slightly thinner than I would like, but has good flavor and a nice chewy texture.

Salads are generously portioned. I sampled two ordered by others in our party and they were excellent. Dewey's uses high-quality ingredients and the flavors and textures are well balanced. 

I disagree with reviewers who say this place is pricy. This is what any customer should expect to pay for good pizza. If you expect to pay less, you may as well stay home and make your own pizza.

Because I'm a connoisseur of beer, I will highlight that Dewey's has a nice variety of craft beers on tap -- there were eight the night I dined there. You can also get beer-flavored water in bottles, if that is what you prefer."}
{"text":"Great place for artisan salads and delicious pizza. The staff is helpful and friendly. Will definitely visit often."}
{"text":"Porky Fig is my favorite pizza.  Atmosphere is clean and refreshing.  Loved to see straight into the kitchen.  This place will let you split your toppings.  So, Porky for me and classic for my hubby.  The prices are a bit more, but the crust is light and excellent and the pizzas are so large that we take home and have a meal with the leftovers.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"when i was little we would go to a pizza place that i will never forget, not because the pizza was fantastic but because they had this window for viewing the pizza guys throwing the dough around, decorating and baking the pizzas and so on.  it was better than tv, my brother and i still talk about it.  
would you guess what dewey's has?  yep, pizza window!  (lakewood location)
so do yourself a favor if you have kids, stop in for a pizza.. it's really good, has nice and fresh toppings, tons of veggies on mine with parsley after baking.. nice touch!  super yummy and big salads that are well thought out, a friendly staff that wants you to enjoy your time there and what can i say about about those pizza guys in the window.  -your kids will be thrilled!"}
{"text":"Dewey's has good pizza. I know people that LOVE IT or hate it. I am in between. I like that the pizza isn't super greasy- the crust reminds me of mine I make at home on a pizza stone. 

They have many pizza to pick from, with an array of topping. We got the Billy Goat recently which was good for a veggie pizza. It had a white sauce but wouldn't mind giving it a shot with a red sauce.

I haven't found a pizza though that beats mine I make at home- maybe because I use homemade sauce and extra red pepper. 

I also got the Greek salad. The half version is more than a enough and the full is great for the price. I liked the dressing on the salad, but could have did without the whole roasted garlic cloves... after fishing them out I was happy. No one likes to bite into a huge clove of garlic on a date!

Either way Dewey's is a cool spot to try in Lakewood, have a beer, and enjoy a pizza with friends."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza, great options, good price. We get pizza here alot when we are in Lakewood, and we love it. It's right across the street from our carwash, and whenever we are down there I can walk across the street, and pick one up. 

They've got great food, drinks, and always have plates and cups for take out of you need them, which is great. 

Food is always hot, and they have a quick turn around. 

Personal favorite: Large Pie, White Sauce. Add Chicken, Bacon, and Parmesan topping."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me??? First time going there, the Socrates greek pizza was phenomenal and the pepperoni pizza was delicious. Good service, price, atmosphere, etc. Definitely will be a regular destination!!"}
{"text":"Fresh pizza sprinkled with a friendly staff makes for a tasty experience. You can easily order 1/2 and 1/2 of any of their selections. A very nice experience ;-)"}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite pizza places around Cleveland.  I love their unique pizzas (and their names) along with a limited yet good beer selection."}
{"text":"Solid pizzas with interesting toppings to choose from.  Beer selection was modest but chosen well, with well-known craft beers as well as some local ones.  The salads are also pretty nice.  Service was fast and friendly.  Ambiance is definitely casual with plenty of seating.  Great to have this place on Lee."}
{"text":"Bronx bomber & Dr Dre are my favs! Dewey's pizza is so yummy! The restaurant is super cute. They have a glass wall where you can see the pizza being made and tossed in the air. Atmosphere is family friendly but still great place for the grown ups. Besides the great pizza they also have delicious salads. If you are looking for a different kind of pizza, go here!"}
{"text":"I went to Dewey's last evening, because their pizza is always soooooo DELICIOUS!!! When our pizza arrived it was yummy, but seemed lukewarm. Our waitress Rachel took it back to warm it up and the manager Taylor immediately came over to apologize. We weren't complaining at all, but he made sure we knew he valued our business and made everything perfect before we left the restaurant. This restaurant is EXTREMELY fortunate to have such an OUTSTANDING manager and HARDWORKING waitress. We will ALWAYS pick Dewey's when we want pizza and continue to recommend their pizza to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Uhhhh. Mmmmm. Yeeah. No.
Family friendly..thats cool. Different types of pizza that is cool also. But it and the smell (not sure what it is..) is not my bag.
Lots of pizza choices in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very good pizza with a great variety of specialty pizzas. It's carry-out or sit down with a good selection of beers (if you're into that). For a chain pizza place they are VERY good. I would give it four stars, but I think the price is a little too high."}
{"text":"First time there.  Greeted by a clean spacious restaurant  where you can talk and not have the next table hear you.  They have a very friendly, helpful staff who paid attention to your needs without asking.  They had a nice selection of micro brews that would satisfy many different palates.  A large selection of specialty pizzas with think crusts are available.  The topping focus is on vegetables with very few met options, though you can build your own.  It is a great place for kids, as they have windows in the kitchen and you can watch your pizza being made.  Yes, I would go back again and again."}
{"text":"Classic pizza taken to the next level.  Amazing crust, incredible choices, excellent service and great environment for dates, groups, families, kids, etc...  Manager is very in touch with customers and invested in making sure that their experience is a great one.  Because of this manager and his team, we will be returning a lot in the future.  We frequented Deweys in Newport many years ago and are thrilled to have this one so close to home now.  The desserts are incredible... save room!!"}
{"text":"The positive reviews are spot-on, so I won't bother repeating. However, why are there no appetizers? Seriously, I would love some garlic bread."}
{"text":"This was a great little hole in the wall kind of place. They allow you to get a pizza half and half of your choice at no extra charge. The Don Corleone and Piggy Fig were terrific choices. Even the triple chocolate cake dessert was fantastic."}
{"text":"This was the only place open on a holiday and was a very solid, last minute spot to eat.  Friendly, courteous, and yummy."}
{"text":"Always good. Fresh ingredients. It's a chain, they're from cincinnati I'm pretty sure, but really good."}
{"text":"Small but solid beer selection. Pizzas, calzones, and salads are all pretty tasty. Every once in a while the pizza could use a bit longer in the oven to get the crust a but crisper, but I think that's always tough when you have mad amounts of toppings."}
{"text":"We had pizza for lunch yesterday and ordered from Dewey's.  The sauce was very good, the pizza's were exactly as ordered and the toppings were ample.  The crust wasn't my favorite, being more like flat bread than traditional hand tossed, but it was okay. Good service."}
{"text":"Love Deweys - love this new featured pizza -  blue ribbon - it's like a chicken cordon blue - fabulous - harvest salad - fabulous - service - fabulous"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, crust chewey, not too thick, good toppings.  We stopped in late on a Tuesday night and the place was deserted.  Our tall, wiry, and bespeckled waiter was very abrupt and clearly wanted us out of the place.  Other than the service, which completely sucked, the pizza was good and the place very clean and appealing."}
{"text":"First let me say that for chain pizza, this is far and above anything else. But it is a chain restaurant and the amount of children running around like its chuck e cheese never let's you forget that. Which i find confusing considering they serve an ok selection of beer. That being said though the pizza itself doesn't disappoint. I love the buffalo chicken pizza  with bleu cheese, celery and onions. (the actual name escapes me...they give their specialty pizzas meaningless dumb names). And the staff is friendly and helpful...just be prepared for a chuck e cheese atmosphere with $20+ pizzas"}
{"text":"Just talking about the pizza: their pizzas are top notch in every way. Their Ryan's Inferno is like 'pizza meets buffalo party' in your mouth. I always have at least a half pie of it every time we go. It's great that you can split the pizza in half in terms of toppings and even sauce type. All in all, I would categorize Dewey's as High Fidelity Pizza that pleases even the people who find pizza boring. I love this place.

Now talking about the restaurant and staff: Sometimes the servers try too hard and sometimes it's vice versa. Most of the time they do great. The atmosphere is great and kid friendly. Always clean and it's great to see them making pies through the window."}
{"text":"ive been here twice and both time were excellent love the quality if ingredients. dining in was clean and servers were great. ill def keep coming here also ordered a pizza for pickup and was just as good."}
{"text":"Good pizza and salad.  We like it that we can order a pizza and have two different kinds.  Choices are interesting and ingredients are fresh."}
{"text":"Great pizza, loved the seasonal tito's pizza. Quiet on a Tuesday night, was perfect for a small intimate birthday gathering. They bring in their desserts from local bakeries and sweet shops and they are amazing."}
{"text":"I am hooked on their calzones!
The people are so friendly and helpful with the orders.  
Definitely the best pizzas!"}
{"text":"Incredible food love the pizza and salad.  Excellent service multiple people working the tables made it extremely enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Good Food. It's artisan pizza. Super yummy. They got an opening so you can see the pizza being made, kids flock to the window. We got a 11\" pizza half Bronx and Socrates Revenge. They aren't big on meat here, most of the specialty pizzas are just veggies. But ohhhh so tasty veggies."}
{"text":"Reliably good. I've been a few times and tried all the pizzas by now, haven't found a single one that I didn't like. 

Slight disappointment- I loved the 5 mushroom pizza the first time I had it, but the second time they overloaded it with mushrooms and it just wasn't the same.

But def one of my go to places around here for good pizza. They also allow half/half of any kinds of specialty pizzas (so you can try all different kinds)."}
{"text":"Just tried Dewey's for the first time and was very impressed! I ordered their small Socrates'  Revenge and was pleased with the quantity of ingredients on top and the crust. I'm afraid all my money will go to this place once the school year starts!"}
{"text":"Usually have a great experience at Dewey's, but this visit for takeout resulted in our large Edgar Allen poe pizza missing two its toppings. At the price of roughly $20 all toppings ought to be included. 

I communicated this issue and my disappointment to the owner who was very apologetic and promised to make it right. Good to see his concern and interest in resolving the problem. I'll continue to be a regular Dewey's customer because they know how to take care of their customers."}
{"text":"This is a great upscale pizza place near Cedar Lee.  I can't tell you how many times I have been here.  It is the local equivalent of California Pizza Kitchen, though I would say it is a bit nicer overall."}
{"text":"Ok. I won't even begin to attempt to defend my 4 year old position on Dewey's, but being that I'm about to become the mayor of this place on foursquare it's safe to say I've had an attitude adjustment.

I've really come around to their regular red sauce pizza. In fact, as of the last 12 months, it's probably my most preferred pizza in the area. The fact that the pies aren't dripping with grease plays a big part in the appeal. Also, some of their monthly specials are really fantastic (hello mexican pizza!). 

I still maintain the Green Lantern is just not ok, but it's clear to me that there are plenty of people that disagree with me on that point. I'd recommend Sarah Z's opinion that you should go with white sauce instead of red sauce. Red sauce + Pesto is the part I couldn't wrap my head or tastebuds around.

Anyway, now that I'm a regular here, I'm still amazed at how consistent Dewey's is in their exceptional service."}
{"text":"I hadn't tried the Lakewood location yet, but after giving the \"Hell No\" to Deagan's and the Wonking Lizard* for major crowds, we got takeout from Dewey's. A little old lady and I chatted for a bit about why everyone was out, and we surmised that it was too hot to cook. Why turn on the oven when your entire apartment feels like one?

The wait wasn't bad at all, and I got to go to Simone's in the meanwhile. We ordered a 13\" half mushroom, half pepperoni and a large Caesar salad.

First the salad. It was great! The dressing was delicious and thick. It had these really tasty garlicky crostini (or whatever the Italian word is for \"little toasted slices of bread that you ordinarily put bruscetta on\"). I keep forgetting that Dewey's has its share of nice salads.

The pizza was actually better than I remembered it to be. I say the key is to stick with the basics and you won't be disappointed here. The last time we got these crazy concoctions with way too many ingredients and they masked the beauty of the crust, which is actually very good. Sturdy (but not rubbery), softish and chewy.

If a pizzeria's pie is good, it'll stand up to being reheated, and perhaps taste even better the next day. That's exactly what happened! The crust got crisper, but everything else was just as good if not better than on the first night. (I shudder thinking of reheated Pizza Pan pizzas! Yuck!)

*I accidentally typed \"Wonking\" instead of Winking, but I thought it was funny so I left it."}
{"text":"I am laughing because I just reread my last review of this place from 2010. Apparently, in 2015 they still train their servers to be up your butt while you're trying to enjoy your food. I mean, yes, thank you for checking in, but 5 times?! By more than one person? Please just let me enjoy my meal in peace. I know they were just doing their job. I don't fault the waiter/manager...but maybe Dewey's should rework their training/philosophy on customer service to be a little less over-the-top. I doubt I'm the only one who feels this way."}
{"text":"I love Deweys pizza. I've always been a fan ever since they first opened in Lakewood. Although I do remember the menu options being a bit better back then. I love creating my own pizza, the goat cheese is amazing. I had the meatball pizza last time & it was incredible. It's fun to watch the kitchen make the pizzas, also. I've never had a bad experience at Deweys. The wait staff is always pleasant & attentive."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written my review for Dewey's yet!

I really like Dewey's for a couple of reasons. First being that it was me and my boyfriend's first date location and I have some pretty fond memories. :) Second, though, is probably more important to you guys: the food. We had the green lantern pizza and it was so delicious! I've also had salads here as well as a calzone and they were both fantastic too! 

Everything they serve is unique and tasty, unless you don't want it to be! You can make your own calzone or pizza, so everything is exactly how you want it!"}
{"text":"I love the Ryan's Inferno - you wouldn't think celery goes well on pizza, but combined with the ranch, cheese, buffalo chicken, and red pepper, it's deliciously spicy. Also great is their gluten-free crust option. That being said, I definitely think it's something you have to try on the restaurant - I had the carry put option this time, and having the ranch on the side and less celery is not the same, hence the lower rating. 

If you're going to Dewey's, I'd also suggest parking a little further in one of the other lots or using street parking. Their lot is narrow, and getting out can be dangerous because the street parking will block your view of oncoming cars!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza! I'm a fan. I've ordered take-out once and eaten in once. The service has always been friendly and easy. So far, our stand out favorite has been the Green Lantern. Additionally, we had a seasonal harvest salad whichconsisted of greens, figs, bacon, pumpkin seeds, boursin cheese, and an apple cider vinaigrette, which was delicious.  I will be sad to see it go when the seasonal menu changes, but I'm excited to see what comes next. 

Also, I always respect a restaurant that accommodates any requests or changes. You can basically customize anything. The only thing is that I was not so impressed with their sausage that we added to an order.  It was sliced (rather than ground) and the flavor was lack-luster... but the other ingredients were still so fresh that it really didn't deter. I just wouldn't order it again. 

Other points: good beers on tap, wish they stayed open later."}
{"text":"It is a fairly small place but the inside is very nice. Service was VERY fast and the pizza tasted amazing. Excellent craft beer list as well"}
{"text":"Dewey's Pizza is a nice place to have dinner or lunch or anytime Pizza. I like this place because it has a very nice location and also very nice seating for groups and couples. There are plenty of options to choose from the menu. Most of the choices are decent and portion sizes are good too. 

I will be a regular at this place for Pizza."}
{"text":"Today was my first Deweys experience, I have been wanting to go to this place for a while now. I don't go to the west end of Lakewood that often but I passed by one day and seen a new pizza shop packed with people, cool ill try it some day. So today was the day. 

First, as soon as I walked In the places looked and smelled like a chain place big uh oh, I knew going in this was a chain but was hoping it didn't feel like one oh well. We sat down and got taken care of right away with a friendly waiter, got menus and put in our drink order. 
I open my menu and WAIT they have no appetizers!! No bread sticks, no garlic bread, no fries, no wings!!! Total X in my book. They have salad and pizza only bummer, so since I get no starter I'm gonna need to split a large pizza not the small I intended splitting. 

We ordered a large, red sauce and sausage, the pizza is thin and huge, the closest to NY style I've seen. The sausage was that fakeo spicy coined sausage you get at happys pizza with was a bummer! Any ways I take my first bite and hmm not bad, the pizza is pretty good a step above pizza hut In opinion but def better then The other crap chains out there. 
My gf got the Greek salad she said it was great, so if you love salad and have a taste for pretty good pizza them Deweys is for you! I would go back but I'm not rushing."}
{"text":"Sensational crust, perfect amount of sauce and cheese, fresh colorful salads, and  friendly, speedy service (without you feeling rushed).  I've tried a variety of their crafty creations and have never been disappointed.  So happy they are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great for the kids as they watch the cooks spin the pizzas through the window into the kitchen area....plus the food is pretty good.  Fun experience if you have kids."}
{"text":"This is the BEST pizza shop in the area. The salad is worth the trip and the service is the best Ive ever seen. You never go without a refill. The area where the pizza is made is surrounded by glass and the cooks are awesome. they play tic tac toe with the kids who are watching them and you can see your pie beng made.  Id give it 10*'s if i could."}
{"text":"Me and my family love Dewey's SO MUCH!! Their pizzas and salads are amazing, and the service is exelent!! It's a great place to go if you're craving pizza. It really is a great place and I totally recommend it!!!!!!,"}
{"text":"I am a bit surprised that this place does not get any anymore shout outs.  First, it is an actual sit down pizza joint.  It is harder then you might think to find one these days.  One of the interesting thins that they are going with the open, industrial look.  At first I was a little bummed, but it really settled with me in no time.  They have great open view into the kitchen (behind glass) for the kids to watch and the folks in the back really play it up with the kids watching.  Lots of fun.

The staff was great.  very attentive and had great suggestions.  They even have their own beer made at an Ohio micro brewery.    

The larger pizza' are actually large.  To give it perspective, and I am not sure when the world changes, but a Large today from just about any pizza joint is what I would have seen as a medium (and in some cases a small Mr. Papa John) when I was growing up.  Here a large will fill your table.

Their salads are the same way.  The large is about $10.00 but would feed 4.  They are huge.

The Pizza options are very creative and you can always build your own.  I will be interested in their white pizza next go round.  In this trip we had the Green Lantern and added pepperoni.  it was fantastic.

The only odd thing is that they do not do appetizers.  I think they helps with keeping the kitchen focused and the storage neat, but I would like to have some garlic bread to snack on, especially given their pizza crust (awesome)."}
{"text":"Dewey's is delicious every time I go. This time I had the Edgar Allan Poe pizza and a Caesar salad and both were incredible. The goat cheese and kalamata olives on the pizza are divine. Although I do love this pizza, I would have to say the thing that is most worth it on the menu would be the calzone. It's cheaper than any pizza and it is just as delicious. You can never go wrong with Dewey's."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pizza but the counter person not very knowledgeable or friendly. She maybe was intimated by my questions so I let it go...The pizza was great so it was worth it."}
{"text":"The crust is phenomenal!! The staff was friendly and very educated on the products.. definitely coming back! Best pizza in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Dewey's is awesome. They have the best crust and freshest ingredients. All of the staff are super friendly and fast. We go here about once a week with the kiddos and they get us in and out, it is perfect!"}
{"text":"First of all, 5 star rating due to them playing two songs by The Killers in the first 10 minutes of walking in. On an unrelated note, the pizza here ain't half bad. In fact, I'd even go as far to say that it is one of the best pizza places Northeast Ohio has to offer. The Arugula Prosciutto pizza, their current seasonal pizza, was FANTASTIC and perfectly done. We didn't even finish it all, and I'm already excited to eat it for breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"This pizza is so good. I went here with my mom after work and the environment was really chill and relaxing and the servers were really nice too. Their pizzas are innovative without being too much. Definitely pizzas are worth trying they give a nice twist on the usual toppings and you get to try something new :)"}
{"text":"Just amazing. Every time I come to Cleveland I have to go and get their delightful southwestern BBQ pizza or sometimes delicious extra cheese pizza. Pizza comes out really quickly. Staff are so fabulous."}
{"text":"Just amazing. Every time I come to Cleveland I have to go and get their delightful southwestern BBQ pizza or sometimes delicious extra cheese pizza. Pizza comes out really quickly. Staff are so fabulous."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza - had the Bronx Bomber without onions. The crust is the best - pillowy and amazing. Best crust in the city!"}
{"text":"I've only done takeout from here. The salads are fantastic; the Greek comes with a dressing so amazing that it will make you question why you have been wasting your time with other so-called dressings. 

My body is stupid and refuses tolerate wheat and soft cheeses, so I cannot personally vouch for their pizza. The husband said its \"really good, but not the best I've ever had.\" But, I can say it ranks as his favorite in Lakewood..."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Cleveland Heights.  Love the glass window to keep the kids occupied!  Awesome!  Always busy.  Good servers"}
{"text":"I love pizza and every chance I get I'm always trying a new pizza place. Our original destination was The Fix Bistro but they were closed so we came to Dewey's and we were glad we did. Our server was awesome. She explained the menu to us and offered suggestions on how we could get more for less. I ordered a ceaser salad which was amazing. Our pizza took longer and the manager came out and explained what happened with the oven and how it over cooked the pizza. He offered us another salad and took care of the bill. The excellent customer service along with the great food is what will definitely have me return."}
{"text":"I love Dewey's and this one is clean and fast!  They offer a no wait reservation through an app. All the specialty pizzas are awesome. My favorite is the Edgar Allen Poe. The pizzas can all be split and you can try two different specialties on the same pie. The salads are always fresh, the peppercorn ranch is a must-have. Our waitress was very friendly! They also have a great selection of desserts and beer/wine."}
{"text":"I ordered a Calzone for lunch.  Whoa, best Calzone I ever ate.  I like that you can choose the ingredients to add to the Calzone when you order.  The chef cooked the Calzone to a golden brown with all the cheese melted inside.  Mostly when I order Calzones at other places, the dough is undercooked or not cooked to full golden brown on the outside which makes the dough really chooey.  If I'm back in the neighborhood I would like to try a beer from their beer menu and their pizza.  Service was timely and the waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"Most excellent pizza. finally !!!! About time ohio gets a a great pizza place. Love the Bronx bomber and the ranch salad. Whew! So gooooooodddddd. Love the service. So attentive and not in a obnoxious kinda way. Wish they had a drive theough."}
{"text":"Ate at this location for the first time last night. I've been to the Cedar Lee location before. I found the same great service and flavors that I did at that location. Great consistency! The spaces even look almost exactly the same. Very attentive service. They have many servers and it seemed that everyone was working together, so our pizza  or drinks weren't  sitting around until our particular server was able to bring them out. I appreciate that attentiveness. Salads are fresh and interesting - not just a slab of iceberg lettuce. You can create you own pizza, which is great for dietary concerns. It's a large space and was full on a Saturday night, but we didn't have to wait to be seated. I also liked that it wasn't deafeningly loud despite the fact that it was full."}
{"text":"Great meal and great pizza. Danielle was our server and super efficient and friendly. You can build your own pizzas based on any dietary concerns. Nice, large sizes with very tasty crust. Pretty good wine selection and they have the kitchen behind glass so you can watch the dough being \"thrown\", old school. Great for the kids or if you have to wait in line. It was pretty busy on a Saturday night but we were relatively early and didn't have to wait at all. Lots of large, family groups so it can be a bit in the loud side."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous. Great service, awesome pizza. This place is a hit. I do like my pizza cooked a little longer but that's a preference type of thing. I love the Green Lantern. They actually left off the mushrooms, the server (Lisa) noticed and fixed it right away. Great place for kids."}
{"text":"The pizza at Dewey's is pretty good. Not the best pizza I've ever had, but it's definitely good. The Edgar Allen Poe, topped with generous amounts of roasted garlic and kalamata olives, is my favorite."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I really liked the calzone! They have a good selection of toppings available and the calzone was seriously delicious. The restaurant itself is very simple and family friendly while still having a unique charm. I liked the layout and found the staff friendly and helpful. Tasty, reasonably priced food. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Dewey's recently opened up another restaurant on the west end of Lakewood. I've been meaning to try this pizza joint since I moved back to Cleveland, but just never made it out to the one on Lee Road. We \"built\" our own pizza -- It was half Green Lantern (red sauce, mozzarella, garlic, mushrooms, goat cheese, artichokes & pesto), and half Edgar Allen Poe (olive oil, mozzarella-fontina, mushrooms, roasted garlic, kalamata olives, goatcheese, and fresh tomatoes). We also started with their autumnal salad with pumpkin seeds and a bunch of other stuff I've already forgotten, but was delicious nonetheless. Overall, this place was pretty decent. I'm a tough critic for pizza seeing as though I usually feel I can make it better at home, but Dewey's does a pretty good job with the gourmet pizza. I liked that you can get 1/2 and 1/2 (even with different sauces), and there are plenty of options on the menu. Personally, I am not much of a fan of Angelo's or Danny Boys (the \"gods\" of pizza on the west side), so I'm happy we now have a better alternative on this side of town. The service was attentive, but the atmosphere was a bit too cold and a modern for my idea of a pizzeria."}
{"text":"It's not really your \"traditional\" pizza.  Yes, you can get a good ole' pepperoni if you want, but the fun part of Dewey's is all the unique combination they offer. 
I had the green lantern.  I was pretty good.  I felt like it was a little overdone with toppings, but still enjoyable.  Other people in my party enjoyed the Hawaiian and then some traditional pepperoni and sausage.  
The price wasn't cheap, but I didn't think it was super expensive either.  The atmosphere and service were good and there was actually parking nearby.  I'd go back again."}
{"text":"With all do respect to NY and Chicago style pizza... I dub thy Dewey's as the official home of Cleveland style pizza! Not too thin like NY, but not one slice and you're full thick like Chicago. Dewey's offers a great middle ground. 

If you have kiddos, this place is great! They have Windows to the kitchen where the kiddos can watch all the pizzas being made. Pizza maker dude even has fun with the kids by tossing the dough in the air and then at the window. Our three year old loved it!

Their menu is filled with lots of specialty pizzas as well as the classics. One cool thing is that you can do half/half of any kind....mix a specialty with a basic. We opted for the Hawaiian on one side and pepperoni on the other. The Canadian bacon slices were huge!! Oh so good! Again, the crust was amazing! I'd say the best part about the pizza  was the sauce! You can for real tell how fresh it was. I could taste the tomatoes and other ingredients with every bite! I'd highly recommend this pizza to anyone!

Lastly, the service. Dewey's has a great approach of \"everyone can help you.\" We had one person seat us. One person order our drinks. One person bring drinks. Another person took our order etc. this was great because sometimes at restaurants you have to flag/find your server, but here... Anyone will help. There was even on server whose specific job was just to walk around with a water jug and fill. Wow!

We loved coming here and will be back! We were so hungry we forgot to take a pic! Sorry y'all!"}
{"text":"Our cravings returned for Dewey's two days later! This time we shared the Grape and Candied Walnut salad (delicious) as well as a half and half pizza. It was as good as last time, if not better.

One thing I did not mention during my last post - Dewey's also has a nice (small) selection of wines by the glass and bottle. For those of us interested in wines, pizza shops often disappoint, but Dewey's is an exception providing several great, lower-priced choices that don't sacrifice flavor.

We also saw that same manager giving one of his servers her review, and I can say that in my 15+ years as an executive that I have never had a review that thorough. He obviously cares about his business and makes customer service a #1 priority."}
{"text":"So I am from Chicago where the Pizza is known to be one of the best places in the world and I have to say I was very impressed. I had the Don Coreleon and it was very good! Just really surprised that hardly any place delivers pizza here?? Thats the most delivered food item in the world, I see a huge business opportunity here...hint hint. Looking forward to try one of the many good sounding pizzas here."}
{"text":"Dewey's is a great pizza place. The pizza is made from scratch and your are able to watch the whole process near the bar area. The pizza is thinner than most but the flavor is fantastic. I tend to go with the no-frills cheese pizza. The beer selection is decent but I wouldn't come here to have more than a couple. The bar has seating for about 5-6 people.

The only drawback is the price (you'll spend over $10 per pie). There are a few better, cheaper options nearby but this Dewey's is great nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner here tonight because my boyfriend wanted me to try it. Atmosphere of the restaurant and design of its interior were different in a good way and quite refreshing. We were quoted a 15 minute wait time, but only had to wait maybe 10 minutes. They also take your phone number so had there been a longer wait time we could have easily browsed the shops in the mall to pass the time. 

We were seated in a nice corner booth. The hostess didn't say anything and walked away too quickly for me to even thank her for taking us to our seats. 

I ordered the candied Walnut and Grape side salad which was delicious! Sometimes when they put fruit in salads it becomes mushy, soft and unpleasant. However the grapes were nice and crisp and the walnuts were a great touch. They also make all of their dressings and the citrus basil vinaigrette on mine was so good I wish they sold it by the bottle. 

As for the pizza, which was made-to-order, we ordered the 11-inch Green Lantern. I liked how they were careful not to over-cook it. The crust was especially delicious. 

They also offer gluten-free crust, but I REALLY wish they had a vegan cheese substitute. 

Waitress was great and service was quick. Would recommend for date night or family dinner."}
{"text":"Sad to say, I think this is my first review of the year.  But, I was pleasantly surprised by Dewey's, as a long time devotee to Angelo's pizza.  I Love Love Love their beer and pizza selection.  Particularly when they have Founder's on tap and Ryan's Inferno.  

The decor is nothing too special, looks like a family friendly chain pizza joint.  I do like the addition of the bar for the adults and the glass window so you can watch your pizza get hand spun!  

The service was relatively attentive, friendly and fairly quick in filling drinks and taking our orders.

The Harvest Salad hit the spot.  I loved the sweetness of the figs mixed with the salty, crunchiness of bacon!! oh so much bacon :)... The roasted pumpkin seed provided the nutty nuts with the Boursin cheese give the salad a nice creaminess with slightly tarte hits.  It didn't even need the apple cider vinaigrette. 

I devoured (KEYWORD: DDDEEEEVVOUURREED) half of a large Ryan's Inferno.  The buffalo chicken pizza hit the spicy notes with the blue cheese give the heat-relieving creaminess. The small slices of celery give each bit a nice little crunch to it. The crust has a slight crunchiness on the outer shell with a soft, chewy inner, perfect hit.  It was the right ratio of toppings to give it an amazing overall mouth-feel.

During an earlier visit, I had a Socrete's Revenge, which was a decent.  It was not the best pizza I had.  I found the pizza too greasy for my liking (yes, I said greasy.. well in comparison to other pizzas.) 

The sad part of this is that the Harvest Salad and Ryan's Inferno are both seasonal items.  Hopefully, Dewey's will consider putting both of them on the menu.  But, just in case, get it while you can!!! :D

The prices are fairly reasonable, assuming you don't go nuts with the beers and large pizzas like I would.  

Between Dewey's and Angelo's pizza- Dewey's has excellent non-traditional pizza (i.e. Buffalo Chicken pizza) and Angelo's delivers an amazing, AMAZING traditional supreme pizza and buffalo mozzarella salad."}
{"text":"We went with friends to Dewey's and had a great night.  Service was good, wine was cheap, and the Green Lantern pizza was awesome!  The salads (strawberry macademia and Greek) were good, but not great and the Wild Mushroom pizza was meh, but overall, I enjoyed it and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great family friendly pizza place! Kids can watch the pizza being made. The staff is great! Fresh salads and pizza always hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because this place has THE MOST AWFUL music I have ever heard! It is so strange, I doubt it even has a genre? Trust me if your boyfriend gave you a mix tape with the songs they played you would dump him.....
With that being said the calzone I ordered was delicious and beautiful! My phone was in the apple store being repaired, so I could not take a pic. Deweys please reconsider your playlist and level at which you play it at! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They not only have great pizza, but their salads are completely out of this world. Fresh veggies, roasted/candied nuts, goat cheese and the best dressings. The Citrus Basil Vin is one of my favorite dressings ever. They sell it for $4.50 a pint too, so you can use it at home. Love it. Their beer list is always current and you're bound to find something you like. The environment is super family friendly which is huge. They also participate in community events sometimes too. My son went to their \"Pizza School\" and had a blast.

I guess the only negative comment I have to make is that they have SO many employees on the floor.! I never really know who my server is! You are greeted by one person, provided drinks by another, order from another, checked on by someone else, etc.When I am dining out, I enjoy having \"my server\" the person I can look to and rely on throughout my meal. When I pay I am never sure exactly who I am tipping. Don't get me wrong, they are incredibly attentive and I have never had a bad service experience, ever. I just wish it was more clear to me, who my main server is when I dine in."}
{"text":"Great food & a friendly staff. It's very family-friendly. They make all their own dressings & the kids can watch the pizzas being made."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here a few weekends ago for a quick meal, and ended up ordering a 13 inch (medium) pizza. When the server came out, he told us that the pizza that they made for us was closer to 12 inches than 13, so they were going to make us a second pizza of the same price for FREE! Honestly we wouldn't have been able to tell the difference between a 12 in pizza and a 13 in one, but the fact that they offered us a second pizza without us asking, on top of fast service, wins this place 5 stars. We will definitely be back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Loved this chain for years and I'm thrilled there is one in Akron! Went early and got a great table. Amazing staff who takes excellent care of you - recommended a new beer. Don't skip the salads - they are worth it. Edgar Allen Poe pie is my fav. Fab calzones as well."}
{"text":"This isn't the best pizza I've ever had, but it's certainly the best I've had in Ohio. Their crust is thin and not chewy. Lots of excellent toppings. Their specialty pizza's are pretty fantastic, and they usually have ~6 excellent beers on tap. I split the Bronx Bomber & the Caprese with chicken, along with a Bell's Two Hearted Ale - Delicious!

There can be a line at peek weekend hours, and the free parking is limited."}
{"text":"I could eat the Porky Fig pizza every day of my life. The Southwestern BBQ Chicken was also great. They put just the right amount of sauce on their pizzas, which is so appreciated. We carried out, but the girl on the phone was very nice. 

The large here is a 17\" and let me tell you- it is huge and definitely worth the $20.

I'll pay a little extra for this quality and the awesome flavor combinations. We will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Family very friendly great place, great pizza, phenomenal salads, great atmosphere all around worth while place to be."}
{"text":"Dewey's has great pizza. My favorites are the Edgar Allen Poe and Ryans Inferno. I think I'd go so far as to say it's my favorite pizza in Cleveland - even if it is a chain. I also love ordering salads here, and I can't really say that at many restaurants. I always order the Greek, but the Peppercorn Ranch is really good as well. If you aren't in the mood for pizza or salad, however, I'd skip this place because that's all that's on the menu outside of the seasonal desserts.The environment is casual and family-friendly, although the atmosphere is sort of lacking. Little kids like this restaurant because they can watch the people making the pizzas. Parking isn't ideal, especially at dinner time on weekends. Prices are fair.

I felt like I needed to review Dewey's because my brother works here, so if you see a short skinny kid with thick brown hair, tell him you came to the restaurant because you read his (awesome) sister's review on yelp! Booya!"}
{"text":"This is what Dewey's has going for them: Stellar service.  Amazing salads. I had the Harvest Salad with figs and cheese and seeds--so delicious. Very reasonable wine prices.

As for the rest, pizzas are meh at best. Not a good integration between sauce and ingredients."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever.  Love the pepperoni and sausage.  Good calzone too.  Well worth the drive from Hudson."}
{"text":"The service was great, the wait staff very attentive.  The pizza, not so much. The ingredients weren't cooked... to give you an idea, the green peppers, pepperoni, and tomatoes were cold to the touch. I'm guessing this is just the \"fresh\" style they promote, but for the money I would expect them to cook it. Just not what I would want when I crave a hot gooey pizza."}
{"text":"My service was wonderful at Dewey's (though, I didn't actually eat there). I stopped in just a buy raw pizza dough to bake at home. My quick visit turned into a full-blown lesson on the intricacies of stretching the dough and baking the pizza. Very helpful!"}
{"text":"Really not great. Sort of cake-y crust, even though it's less deep-dish than some Cleveland pizza. The whole thing was very cheery. Sort of like soft-batch cookies. It tasted underdone to us, so we put it in the oven for a few minutes. Even then it was barely ok. Mass produced tasting."}
{"text":"I think this was the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life! This place has a very modern minimalist vibe and it's very clean and simple inside! The pizza took about 10 minutes after we ordered it. We ordered a cheese pizza 13\" with meatballs on one side! It was just amazing!!! Def reccomend!!! Also we got a chocolate cake which was amazing!! The sauce is very good u can taste the fresh tomato sweet taste! The cheese is go good and gooey!! And the crust is so good like fried dough!!! If u haven't been then what are u doing????"}
{"text":"If you want great pizza in Cleveland and a good place to take your family, go to Dewey's.  And they have good beer on tap.  I will say the parking is not the best but that is not a deal breaker for me.  That is how it is in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Words do not begging to describe how nice the staff are...my family helps take care of special needs adults and we bring them in there whenever we have an event that we are going to downtown Cleveland. They treat them like any other normal person and that is AWESOME!!!!! Our only complaint is that they open at 4pm :-(. It's not fun being in a car with a special needs adult screaming pizza and you get there and they aren't open for another hour :-/ and you have to be to the venue no later than 5:30. On an up side if we make it there when they open the service is fast for a pizza place. Not a long wait at all after you are sat and your order is taken...they have it down to a science. The guys making the pizza behind the glass make it fun for the family no matter the age. 
Also on a side note took my boyfriend there for the first time this past weekend he loved it and said we WILL be back and I started to laugh at him because I have never seen him eat so fast...next time we are getting a larger pizza lol.
Oh yeah and a request I am sure you have heard before please open earlier on the weekends!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza but REALLY expensive.  That's all.  Their green lantern pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the harvest salad.  I especially like the fact that they sent the salad dressed.  It was a perfect amount of dressing too.

Green Lantern
Green Lantern
Green Lantern - will dream about getting this one again!

Tried their mushroom specialty pizza.   Interestingly it had capers, which was a nice twist.  It was good.  BUT not as great as Crust's mushroom pizza.

Agree with other reviewers:  clean, great if you have kids, a bit noisy(but that makes it fun too) and attentive staff.   Keep in mind it's the specialty salads and specialty pizzas that are the lure.  IF you want a kick ass supreme pizza or a regular pepperoni/mushroom, then Angelo's is a better route.

Tried a bite of their chocolate cake.  It was pretty but very dry.  It needs to be drizzled with goo or a bigger dollop of whipped crème.  The more I think about it, I doubt they make that there.  May not be the best of places to get dessert.

The location is in a congested area.  There are a lot of bars nearby.  Parking may be tricky on busier nights/weekends.   Perhaps there's valet nearby that you can take advantage of?


Green Lantern!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit and my 5 stars are for the wonderful customer service we received.  My daughter and I were splitting a pizza and my half of the pizza came out wrong.  I told the waitress I would just pick off the wrong items,  no big deal.  They offered to make another pizza just for me and I said that wasn't necessary.  When we got our bill,  we were only charged for our drinks.  I wouldn't have even thought of asking for a discount, but the waitress felt bad and removed pizza charge from our bill. Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Went here for their soft opening. They have to be the friendliest staff around. I had called earlier for a reservation, but the manager was in a meeting (they were not technically open yet) but actually me
back afterwards. Their pizza is great, it will be a go to place for me. Ingredients are very fresh. We had a harvest salad, backyard BBQ  and caprice pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely one the most delicious pizzas I've eaten. Perfect blend of ingredients. Friendly wait staff. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Deweys pizza never disappoints. Everything on their menu is amazing! I had a seasonal salad this past winter that blew me away! My favorite pizza is the billy goat with no mushrooms, but anything you order will be fantastic!"}
{"text":"I took the kids. Very family friendly, kids to watch the guy making pizzas.  House salad was delicious, could have just had that.  Good greens, some nuts, dried cherries and blue cheese I believe.

Pizza was good, we had the Hawaiian,  Crust was really good, very light.  I will go back."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza/family restaurants on the westside. I am not a \"foodie\" but I do eat out quite a bit -- not at fancy places, I like things simple with good service. You will find both at Dewey's in Lakewood and much the same in Cleveland Heights. 

I have become a regular so the staff at Dewey's is always friendly and attentive. I love the shared serving style - they do not have one person serving a table the entire meal, rather the entire wait staff helps one another and all the customers throughout their meal. We've never had a problem with service. There was only one occasion when a newer server did drop our calzone on the floor when handing it off to the table but the manger was quick to come and help her, get us new food and comp the meal at the end of our stay. A+ customer service.

The food is great. I usually eat their calzones and always get the Peppercorn Salad. The salad is perfectly dressed before it arrives at the table and you don't need to ask for fresh cracked pepper -- the staff has it in hand when they arrive. The calzones are AWESOME! Best anywhere I've eaten. THe pizza is good, it's NYC style thin crust and the toppings are all fresh. 

Thank you Dewey's for having great food and a wonderful staff."}
{"text":"I like pizza. Correction. I love it. It is my favorite food group. If I could eat it for every meal and not blow up to the size of the stay puft marshmallow man, I would. 

Dewey's does an amazing job, at pretty much at everything. I kind of want to live there. We got two salads, the house salad and the peppercorn ranch. Only order the large if that's all you are going to eat for a week or if you are sharing with three other people. What I'm saying they are huge. Both were dressed perfectly and all the ingredients were fresh and delicious! 

Then the pizza. It was so good. We split one large into two specialties, also a great feature of Dewey's. We got the Ryan's Inferno and the Edgar Allen Poe. Four thumbs way up. The toppings are interesting. Not your basic pep/mush, which I know they have, but why bother? I can make that at home. The huge whole pieces of roasted garlic was the highlight. And please reheat this the next day in the oven. It doesn't deserve the microwave, that's just mean.

The only negative was the wait, we went at about 6:30 on a Friday night and it was jammed and a 45 minute wait. So we put our name down and went next door for a cocktail, came back and had another cocktail (great beer and wine selection) and watched the performance through the window of young eye candy tossing dough and entertaining the kids until our table was ready. We were told that if you come between 6p and 7:30p it's just going to be crazy like that, but will clear out after that, so plan accordingly, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza no matter what you order and the service is excellent. Connor waited on us and he is great. But coming on a cold snowy night, I can't figure out why they keep the inside so cold. Pizza was cold after the second slice. If it wasn't for the good service and the good food, I would have given 2 stars for to night's cold performance. Try the pizza, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The beginning of October a friend took me to Dewey's for a belated birthday dinner.  I'd never been to any of the locations, so I was excited to eat at a pizza place where creating your own pizza is encouraged.

First off, parking sucks, it REALLY sucks.  There's a small lot in the rear of the building, and street parking in the front.  But, as we all know, parking sucks in most of Lakewood so it's something we are used to by now.

We visited during the week, around 5:30PM, and there were 3 additional tables with customers.  The restaurant was clean, our waitress was very nice and attentive and answered any questions we had about the food.  My friend ordered the candied walnut & grape salad, while I opted to make my own pizza.  I ordered an 11\" Dewey's Original with minced garlic, mixed mushrooms and buffalo chicken.  I was a little hesitant to order buffalo chicken because I absolutely can't handle hot food, but figured why not give it a try?  I definitely wasn't disappointed.  The chicken was a tiny bit hot, but nothing I couldn't handle.  The crust was thin, which I love, but not paper thin.  It had a bit of a chewy texture, but had a great crunch on the bottom as well.  The garlic was definitely noticeable, but not overpowering, and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly.  My pizza was absolutely delicious, and I wound up taking over half of it home with me.   My friend said her salad was awesome as well; I could see the thing was huge and it definitely looked good.

Overall the food was great, the service was excellent and the restaurant was super clean.  Great place for pizza!"}
{"text":"One of the benefits of having a kid who's in the midst of growing from a tyke to a tween is that he's always hungry for pizza. My nine year old's eyes light up when we tell him that dinner tonight will be at Dewey's. Before you sit down, you can see your dough being stretched by some of the younger employees. They take it upon themselves to get the kids who've flocked to the large window into the action by throwing flour at them. Invariably, three quarters of the kids will flinch and laugh, daring him to do it again.

When it's time to eat, our son knows exactly what he wants; his half of our seventeen inch pie is and will forever be the X-Pepperoni, and I'm thankful for it. It's so simple, with just a touch of heat from the pepperoni that's definitely not the pre-packaged, non-refridgerated stuff from a grocery store. This is the good stuff. The crust, for those crustophiles out there, is both thin and chewy, neither too thick or too cracker-like, a perfect mix for those that like it both ways. 

That leaves the wife and I to decide what our half of the pizza should be. The best part of Dewey's is that if we decide we want our half white, we don't have to compromise. They'll do half white, half red, no problem. And the white pizza is fantastic. Slightly garlicky tang from the olive oil make it perfectly crispy. make it a perfect entree for one of their salads. The salads are always perfectly dressed, even for a dressing hound. Our favorite topping is either the Bronx Bomber, their version of a \"Supreme\" or the Southwest BBQ Chicken.

For the beer selection, I enjoy that they tout craft beers, without craft beer meaning \"we carry Sam Adams and Dortmunder\", and that's it. Their stock rotates often and is very seasonal, as well as a few constant beers on tap. 

My one gripe about the experience is the \"server by committee\" method they use to keep your glasses full and your time in the restaurant a good one. Folks, I'll say this: Keep your glasses out of view if they get below half full, and you're having a good conversation. You'll be hounded by four or five servers, asking you if you'd like another. It's not a bad thing, I'd just prefer to have a single server, rather than the entire restaurant at my beck and call. 

We've been to Dewey's at least ten times, and we'll probably go ten more (this year)."}
{"text":"So good! Crust awesome, we had 3 different pizzas all very good, salads great! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"First time visiting Dewey's, the place is very nice, clean and love the huge window to see into the kitchen. The staff is very knowledgeable and service is excellent. We ordered the blueberry almond salad, it had very fresh blueberries and had great flavor it came together very well. Pizzas we ordered were the porky fig, it had fig jam base with prosciutto, caramelized onions and gorgonzola cheese. It was way to sweet, that is all you could taste. It definitely needed something to counterbalance the sweetness. Also had the Edgar Allan Poe, the kalamata olive overpowered the entire pizza. Then we had the Mad Hatter, all the flavors worked on this one the only problem with this pizza was the same across the board, the dough although it looked fully cooked and crisp it was undercooked leaving the center doughy. Overall not really impressed with the dough they use for their pizza's."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 friends the other night for my birthday. We've heard great things about the place so we decided to check it out. Our waiter was great and the staff in general was friendly. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed with my pizza. I got the Caprice. It was utterly tasteless. I was starving and didn't want to wait for another so I ate most of it. For dessert I had the cannoli cheesecake which tasted pretty good. A couple hours later my stomach wasn't feeling great, not sure if it was the pizza or cheesecake. I want to give this place another try because my friends did enjoy their pizzas, I'll just have to try a different one next time. Hoping next time is better!"}
{"text":"Tasty!   My family and I were looking for a good eat-in pizza option and Dewey's was a great choice!   This was our first visit (and definitely not our last).   We arrived at approximately 6:00 on a Saturday night, the place was pretty crowded, and there was a short wait (maybe 15 minutes) for seating.  The waiting area is a bit small, but also includes 2 viewing windows to the kitchen where you can watch the pizza being made.  The 2 year old dining with us, loved the view.   We were seated and our server was the BEST, he asked us if we had been to Dewey's before, and when he realized that we had not, he poured on the charm.  He helped us to make our decision, answered all questions and left to put in our order....large caesar salad, to share and 17\" pizza with 1/2 pepperoni & sausage and the other 1/2, sausage and mushroom.  The salad arrived a short time later, fresh romaine, homemade dressing, sliced parmesan and fresh toasted baguette croutons.  The salad was large enough for 4 adults and a 2 year old to share.   Then the pizza arrived, huge, hot and fresh.  The crust was just the right thickness and the toppings were tasty.....This was a great meal.   We will definitely return to Dewey's!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland heights hands down 
Love the BBQ pizza and Edgar Allen Poe pizza"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad pizza here.  Their Seasonal pizzas can sound strange (sometimes...Like a pizza with a mustard base, hot dogs, and sauerkraut), but they're always awesome.  I usually don't order a salad when I go out for pizza....but their salads are pretty great.  Not to miss.  I recommended the Peppercorn Bacon Ranch.
Prices are reasonable.  You can have your pizza split, if you want to try two different types.
Also, they usually have a pretty good draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Excellent service that is pleasant, professional, and everyone is eager to help. This is a real gem in the heart of Cleveland Heights."}
{"text":"We love it here. Consistently good pizza, the crust is the best part. Great to order a couple with a big party and share different kinds because they let you do half & half of anything, even with different sauces! Don't forget salads, we had their seasonal strawberry and it was to die for, that citrus basil vinaigrette is KILLER! 

Staff is beyond accommodating and friendly. They all help each other out and assist any table. They are so thoughtful, even brought my dad a souvenir cup as a gift wrapped with happy birthday written on it to celebrate the occasion."}
{"text":"First, let me open with seconding all of the 5 stars that have come before mine - Dewey's pizza is truly one of kind delicious. 
Next, let me compliment the outstanding customer service I encountered tonight on my first visit to Dewey's.  I had ordered a large pepperoni pizza (perhaps enormous is more of an appropriate descriptor) and a side Greek salad to-go.  After paying for my purchase, an employee, whom I believe was a manager, came out and shared with me that the crust of the pizza she had in hand was not of their standards and she would like to prepare me another.  She showed me the pizza, it looked delicious, but the crust was perhaps a bit thin, but not enough that I would have complained and I consider myself a 'foodie'.  The next pizza she brought me could have been that of a picture featured in a magazine. Once home, the entire family raved about how awesome it was.  Not only will the perfectly balanced pizza (and Greek salad) make me a return customer, the outstanding customer service and attention to detail sets Deweys apart.  I appreciate the employee that goes the extra mile as it seems to be a rarity these days.  
Gift cards brought me in today but the food AND the service today will keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pizza around for the main fact that the service is great, and the pizza is even better. Calzones are on a next level and Pizza is even better than that. The service cares a lot about your experience as you eat, you will typically find that you are never empty on your drink. Overall Dewey's is a great restaurant; Five Stars."}
{"text":"I HATE HATE HATE PIZZA but I sure do heart Dewey's Pizza. 

As stated above I really do not enjoy pizza. I will eat it in dire straits but I'd honestly rather eat spaghetti-o's most of the time, but sometimes for social functions you have to eat it. That is how I came across Dewey's. I had likely driven past Deweys a million times and never thought of stopping in. . . because it was pizza. That was until we had a work dinner there, to get to know a new candidate for a position. 

Walking in I thought it was just like any other pizza place so I was not so psyched. Though I was excited to be able to see the pizza makers toss their dough (want to occupy a small child?). Anyways my coworker kept saying this was the best pizza in cleveland blah blah blah. I figured it was pizza. I was pleasantly surprised to have quite an enjoyable pizza experience. We ordered 2 large pizzas each done halves. I tried all but one which was pepperoni which upsets my tummy. 

It was good. REALLY GOOD. And best of all inexpensive. Now you can have your usual make your own type fare but their specialty pizzas are what makes Dewey's special. Don't miss them.

I have gotten their pizza now for multiple events and I've never ceased to be impressed with the quality for the price.

I recommend 
The Green Lantern (with white sauce instead of red)
Their seasonal pizza
The Harvest Salad *figs and bacon and pumpkin seeds yum yum*
Dining in or take out

Hit or Miss
Parking the lot is really small

Avoid like the plague
Sadly the bathroom was not so clean"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. We liked the feta cheese. 
But I think it is a little over priced.
I am glad I got to try it though."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza and Stromboli, good food great service too. Price is good, wanted more veggies in my stromboli"}
{"text":"Is the food good? Yes. Is it worth $30 for pizza and a salad? Meh. Okay okay....so let me explain some more. Amazing decor. Really, they did a great job! Super clean, great colors and a perfect blend of modern and traditional. Only have beer, which is a bummer but they have a good selection. Their pizza is pretty darn amazing, I cannot lie. But it better be for $25 for a large. Get the Porky Fig. You're welcome. Amazing gluten free crust as well (making those Celiacs HOLLA!) Salads are fresh and the lettuce is actually green. No iceberg here folks. I would highly recommend going in a group and splitting things....that way you can actually afford it."}
{"text":"Overall a very good pizza place both in terms of food and atmosphere. 

The restaurant has a little bit of parking on the side, and there are various lots around the Cedar-Lee area. The interior was always clean and well maintained, staff were friendly, and no drama to report.

The food is basically comprised of pizza, salads and calzones. They're very big on speciality pizza types, although they aren't so frou-frou as to be unrecognizable as pizza.

My biggest complaint is actually that their Coke fountain mixture was always kind of weird. As a big Coke drinker I can detect these things. If thats the only thing I can muster up about a place, then its a safe bet that its pretty good overall."}
{"text":"This place was *fantastic*. I came in late, so I practically had the restaurant to myself, which perhaps made it easier for them, but I was *very* well cared for. I had prompt and regular service without hovering. My server knew the menu, presented it well and made intelligent and useful recommendations. My salad was fresh and tasted *awesome*. The pizza was *amazing*: thin crust, perfectly well done. I can't say enough good about the end of the crust (the fatter part): it was sustantial, light, tasty, perfectly well done... and the pizza itself was great. They combined pepperoni and pineapple (my favorite combination) *much* better than most restaurants do with that unusual combination. Makes me wish I lived in Cleveland so I could come back more often."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and ordered two larges for my family and they were huge! Good toppings and good crust. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Dewey's ever since they opened up their first Northeast Ohio shop in Cleveland Heights back in late 2005. Sure, they're a chain, but they've done chain pizza right. Fresh ingredients, unique pizza toppings, local brews and a clean, hip atmosphere. They don't do much, pizza, calzones and salads, but they've perfected their menu.

The Lakewood location is still pretty new, having opened just five short years ago, but it's clear from the crowds and the Yelpers rave reviews, that they've managed to create another Cleveland-area pizza success story. The staff is always friendly, drinks are incessantly refilled, and the food, hell, who doesn't love a good pizza? You can also watch the pizza making peeps through a glass-walled fishbowl of a kitchen. Entertaining and informative. Gotta love it.

I've had several of their signature pies including the wild mushroom (a fungus-lovers feast), the green lantern (a more traditional offering with artichokes and pesto) and the billy goat (goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, green peppers). I've never been disappointed. The crust is hand-tossed, always made fresh, never frozen, and the toppings taste like they're straight out of the garden. Speaking of garden, I love their salads, too. The first Dewey's salad I ever had was their house salad and I'm convinced it started the whole \"goat cheese/dried cranberry/nut/vinaigrette\" thing. Now it seems that every restaurant has some variant of it. 

Anyway, on our most recent visit I got the harvest salad, the seasonal offering, and it was delicious. Field Greens with dried figs, applewood smoked bacon, roasted pumpkin seeds (out of the shells, of course), and Boursin cheese. The dressing, an apple cider vinaigrette, was great and present in just the right amount. My wife opted for the candied walnut and grape salad. Field Greens with chopped sweet, crunchy candied walnuts, red grapes and Gorgonzola cheese, tossed with a citrus basil vinaigrette. Fresh, tasty and eaten pretty fast.

Our pizza was the Dr Dre. Not your standard pizza, this one was topped with sliced chicken, pickled jalapenos, fresh tomatoes, green peppers, red onion, bacon and a drizzle of ranch dressing. I've no idea why it's called the Dr Dre, but it worked. Spicy, crunchy, vegetable-y, and sweet, it had just about every flavor you could want in a pizza. Admittedly, I did miss the red sauce, but I still had no problem devouring nearly half of it. 

I've definitely had pizza's that I've liked better and I've definitely eaten in restaurants that I've enjoyed more but for what Dewey's is I really dig it. Some may complain that they are overpriced and I get it. Nearly $18 for a 13\" pizza is a bit steep. Dewey's isn't about cheap food. They're food is consistently good, the salads are constructed perfectly and the service is prompt and courteous. Oh yeah, and the background music is great - Phish, Hendrix, Van Morrison, and not blasting my eardrums out. It's hard not to like it."}
{"text":"Came her last night with the husband. Used the Waitlist on Yelp and got a table in 5 min. Initially service was super fast, we got our drinks right after sitting down....then no one ever came back with refills and we waited 20 min to order.....then 40 min for 1 pizza. We got a large Bronx Bomber, it was good but nothing to write home about. I liked that it wasn't greasy, but it was cold in certain parts, made me think it sat for awhile before it was served. The restaurant is cute and trendy, but not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I used to eat here every Monday with a friend after we attended a film at the Cedar Lee. There are two reasons we loved this place: the service was consistently top-notch and the pizza really is quite good.

Eventually, though, we started going less and less, until we stopped going entirely. At some point we looked at our check and each dished out 8 bucks to split a pepperoni pizza (without any drinks, mind you) and realized that Dewey's had gotten too expensive for what it is - a chain pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"I question the palettes of people giving Dewey's pizza a 5 star rating. Are you true pizza aficionados? Is this your first time eating somewhere besides Pizza Hut and Papa Johns? I like the concept of Deweys... I've seen a very similar, modern, pizza-and-beer joints in Portland but out there the pizza actually had flavor. The service was great, house salad was delicious, but it all comes down to the pizza and it was bland at best. The sausage was definitely meh-worthy, the veggies seemed fresh, but the crust, sauce and cheese were all boring and bland. Even Donato's has more flavor than this. Kinda pricey too. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I have dreams about their porky fig pizza -- it's got prosciutto, fig jam, and gorgonzola cheese. Sweet and salty! It's definitely one of my favorite pizzas, so I'll give Dewey's 5 stars even though its parking lot is super small (there's a metered garage across the street). Crust is on the thinner side and just chewy enough. 

Definitely call in your order. During peak times, it can take 40-60 minutes to get your pizza! When picking up your pizza, bring a buddy who can jump out and grab it so you don't have to fuss with parking. I've never tried dining in, but this also seemed super crowded."}
{"text":"Went there this past week, the food was delicious and the service was excellent. I had the grape and candied walnut salad and bbq chicken pizza. 

I went there on a wednesday evening, so I don't really know how they hold up when they are busier. But they did not understaff themselves for a slow evening. And my beverage was never allowed to be empty. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Friendly people, delicious pizza. I wasn't a huge fan of their cheesecake, but I don't think they made it in house - the person who took my order said they switch local desserts around."}
{"text":"Making a half white and half sausage and pepperoni is a pretty amazing feat in my opinion.  Both sides were pretty good...their specialty pizzas all seem to have veggies and not a whole lot of meat.  I would go back.  A bit more expensive that I would have liked.  I like Cleveland Pizza House better..."}
{"text":"Best calzones! Love that I can get whatever I want in it! Sometimes the wait can be a little long, so prep yourself for that. Otherwise, great!"}
{"text":"Only place I will eat pizza. I like the tasty but not too doughy crust, variety of toppings and salads, and fam friendly atmosphere. Great take out, wish they had gluten free options."}
{"text":"After living in Italy for more than a year, i'm very particular about my pizza, but I must say that I was impressed by Dewey's. Their pizza is nice and thin and was topped perfectly with specialty ingredients. We had half the Edgar Allen Poe with roasted garlic, goat cheese and olives (my favorite!), while the other half was the Billy Goat with sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese and and green peppers. Both were excellent! 

I had heard that it was a chain, but it seems to be anything but that. They offer many other twists on original pizza and I love the option that you can do half and half so as to try more options. 

I've only lived in Cleveland for a few months, but this is my favorite so far!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's \"family friendly\" and we all know what that means. BUT you go for the pizza, right? Right. Thing is - a Chicago girl needs to find her some good tomato pie and Dewey's is great. I don't approve of white sauce and chicken on pizza, but that's easily avoided. Split a large salad, order a few beers and then dig in. Always good.

My only beef I guess, is the service. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's so much of it. Every time we go, there seems to be one server per table and that means the person who takes your order won't be the person who brings you refills, or checks on you, or clears your plates, or takes more drink orders - in fact, it will be different people that do all those things. The servers are always friendly and I'm always satisfied when I leave though, so if it's bad to be *too* staffed then I guess they're doing wrong right."}
{"text":"Could be good if the pizza wasn't so laughably undercooked. I hope they were just behind on orders and this isn't their norm because its awful."}
{"text":"I love this place.  

The servers were so nice.  We couldnt decide on what type of pizza to share (just two ppl) and the server offered that we can get two types for each half.  They have such great choices here!  The combinations sounded (and tasted) so good!  Genius.  And then we each split some of the other type, but got to chow down on our own.  

And the place serves beer!  LOVE IT.  Perfect for date night.  

Downside (but not really so much of a downside but if you have kids you'll understand), kids were EVERYWHERE.  Running around everywhere.  I get that some parents want to wind down the workweek and have a beer and let the kids get what they want and they get to spend time out of the house and everyone wins, but if I get to be out of the house without my kid, I dont really want other kids yelling and running around.  You know?  But I get it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I usually get carry out so I can't speak to the table service at this location. My wife and I recently relocated back up here from Columbus where Dewey's started. We always had great service and great food at the locations down there. So far, every time we've ordered from this location it's been the same great food we have come to expect from Dewey's. 

I understand some of the reviews stating that the pizza isn't anything great but I would disagree. The crust on their pizza is just the right kind of chewiness and thinness and the quality and variety of the toppings is excellent. The seasonal pizzas are typically a must get, especially the Tito Santana. I also love the different types of base sauces you can get. Add to that the delicious calzones, salads, and drink varieties and it definitely isn't an average pizza joint."}
{"text":"If you like soft warm baked flakey crust and fresh tasting toppings, then Dewey's is your place. 

Friendly staff and comfortable environment makes Dewey's pizza taste even better. Compose your own masterpiece or try one of their pre-designed pizzas, you'll be satisfied either way. I always order a large because the leftovers the next day are just as good."}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Even a plain cheese with their unique slightly spicy red sauce is amazing.  Seriously their red sauce is the best pizza sauce i have ever had.  Also recommend the Socrates Revenge and the meatball pizza.  Great selection of draft beer."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about their pizza's, but they forget about the other wonderful things on the menu - like their salads! They have seasonal salads that are heavenly.  

Go for either - and you'll definately enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Oh Dewey's...why did you have to do this to me. 

One of my favorite pizza spots in the area. I felt like the quality of ingredients showed in not only the taste of the pizzas (but also the prices)-but hey, worth the extra $$ in my opinion. 

I have tried several of their pizzas and never felt disappointed. Large enough to share with 1-2 other people and some pizzas can be halved with varying toppings. 

Also, they have great beer options! Not a wide selection but some good Pilsners and Lagers."}
{"text":"I ordered three different pizzas for my group of hungry friends and was pretty excited to try Dewey's since their website listed such great sounding combinations. We tasted Billy Goat, Ryan's Inferno, and Southwest BBQ Chicken. I am sorry to say that I was not impressed at all and was actually a little disappointed. The crust was neither crispy nor hearty, the toppings lacked substance, and the price seemed high. Just an overall \"meh\" feeling about Dewey's."}
{"text":"Like Mike (see below) was told, this IS the best pizza in the area (that I am aware of) - but don't forget that the area IS Cleveland, so technically the standard isn't very high.

BUT: compared to other restaurants in the area, I do like it more than others. 

It's also super accomodating - you can get half tomatoe sauce/half white sauce pizzas on the same pie!"}
{"text":"Very nice fresh food and even better a nice beer selection. Pizza is very mild, but wisely the table has salty Parmesan cheese and spicy red pepper flakes for the real Italians that visit. Servers are wonderfully casual and highly efficient at drink refills and turning tables which is a requirement because the lobby fills up quickly after 5:00 with families. Glass encased kitchen keeps kids occupied with something they don't usually see. Mazel mazel."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday.  Place was relatively empty when we arrived (3-4 tables), but picked up as we had our meal.  As you can see in other reviews, this is a kid-friendly place.  We noted on our way out the door that it had, in fact, won an award for being kid-friendly a few years back.  Hvaing said that, if you have kids, this is a great spot to come to.

Food - very good pizza.  The cheese is the best part.  We got a small half cheese/half pep for the kids, and a half Bronx Bomber/half Caprice for the older folks.  Both were very tasty. = FOUR stars

Beer - good selection for a pizza joint, all micro brews on tap. = FOUR stars

Service - outstanding.  Our waiter was very attentive, and they did not hesitate to put our pizza back in the oven when asked. = FIVE stars

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love the Edgar Allen Poe pizza!"}
{"text":"This is another Lakewood gem.  How is it we are so lucky? ... and how is it that I've just now visited Dewey's?  I'm torn with wanting to tell everyone about this awesome place and wanting to keep it to myself.  I have been an Angelo's fan and I will still order from there but this is a completely different and gourmet experience so don't try to compare the two.  For me this is an \"oh, happy day\" experience from the first bite and the service here is top-notch.  I was by myself tonight and glad to say I got the same great care as everyone and not marginalized (sometime if you are alone places will tuck you away and never check on you, just sayin')  

Dewey's starts with a short yet varied and interesting draft beer list. I couldn't quite decide so my server, Carla even brought me 3 to taste. They have a variety of salads with high quality veggies, cheeses, fruits and amazing dressings.  Carla was awesome in helping me sort out all the choices and they will trade out ingredients to customize just the way you'd like.  I went with the candied walnuts and grape salad which was exceptional -- I'll be back just for the salads. Seriously fresh and perfectly balanced. Then the pizza arrived and was delish with an amazing combo of flavor profiles!  It is a soft thinner crust that allows the ingredients to shine and you won't feel that you just had a loaf of bread.  I loved that they will allow you to substitute any of the ingredients and also that they will also let you order half and half of the specialty pizzas or the design your own pizzas.  As the customer you are in-charge!  I went with the seasonal pizza on half and the fig one on half.  Both so incredibly fresh with high quality cheese neither had a traditional red sauce but both were just fabulous.  There are so many  options on their menu that I would love so doing halves will allows more tastes to decide on my ultmate favs..

So, this is my new favorite casual restaurant and it is just as affordable as other upper end pizza places while offering a completely different pizza experience.  I may need to make this a weekly ritual!  After all, what is better than a meal prepared by someone else and made with high quality, healthy ingredients? And seriously, I don't think you'll find a more professional, or nicer service team than here.  So now that you know how great this is don't waste another minute!"}
{"text":"Consistent and extremely good service. Is Dewey's Pizza the best pizza you've ever had, maybe not, but on the other hand, it very well just may be; it's pretty good pizza leaning toward the New York side of the pizza-style spectrum. 

I am a frequent patron of Dewey's, usually during the week when I take my kids out to their weekly \"dinner with Dad.\" I have always been most impressed with their service. It's probably the most attentive wait staff in any restaurant that I have visited. Ever. And never intrusive; the perfect balance. 

On the menu-side of things, Dewey's offers a great selection of specialty pies and seasonal salads, as well as a featured monthly pizza each month. Some of my favorite specialty pizzas are the Edgar Alan Poe with Olive Oil, Mozzarella, Fontina and Goat cheeses, Kalamata Olives, and Roasted Garlic, and the Socrates Revenge with Olive Oil, Minced Garlic, Fontina, Spinach, Black and Green Olives, Red Onions and Tomatoes. In April, they offer their Ballpark Pizza as their monthly pizza, with sausage, sauerkraut, spicy mustard and caramelized onions; truly a better flavor combination on pizza than it may sound. Of course you can also \"create your own\" from an extensive list of standard and gourmet ingredients, which are always fresh and delicious. All pizzas can be customized any way you like, or split 50/50 with varying ingredients per side. It's never a hassle. Calzones are also available and have become a family favorite too. 

Dewey's is a close 5-star for me, but I don't really hand out too many of those. It's a great place for friends and family though, and somewhere that I will continue to patronize well into the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Dewey's is sooooo awesome! It's one of those restaurants where I will keep eating regardless of how full I am, just because it's so delicious (I guess that's a little unhealthy and indulgent...oh well). Some of my favorites are the green lantern, killer veggie, caprice, Socrates revenge, Edgar Allen Poe, and billy goat. I just realized that I went through almost their entire menu, so obviously I'm a big fan.

My boyfriend always gets a sausage pie with onions and jalapenos. It's kind of a weird combo, but he loves it, and you probably would too if you're into that sort of combination.

Dewey's can do no wrong."}
{"text":"Thoroughly satisfied! The staff were very welcoming and the pizza pie was delicious. We settled on the Bronx, which I liken to a deluxe. The ingredients were fresh and plentiful. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a meal. Staff was very nice and did a great job. Music was good, and still reasonable to talk with. Food was very good, and came quickly. They have a very good looking list if specialty pizzas, with toppings you don't see every day. (they were especially good about doing two different specialty halves, which is a good way to sample more!) I definitely plan to get back in here a few more times to try them all!"}
{"text":"The pizza at this place is ALWAYS great! They have a great selection and always have something seasonal on the menu to try. The really nice thing is that they split the pizzas in half! So you and your boyfriend do not have to agree on toppings ;) There is a pizza for any mood and I have not had a bad one yet. Last time we went we had the Socrates Revenge... If you are an olive fan... GET IT! So yummy! The place is usually packed and they don't take reservations, so prepare to wait at least 15-35 min for a table, but once you sit down service is usually pretty quick. Their beer list is a little lacking, but they have a huge wine list. Overall a great spot!"}
{"text":"I would give this a slightly lower rating, but I got lucky with finding a parking space. Parking is a premium.  That being said, the location in the Cedar Lee is ideal.  it has become a locations for families and friends to congregate.  The menu is basic pizza and salads.  However, the salads are amazing and vary with the seasons.  The pizzas are extremely fresh.  You can watch yours being made, a great thing to keep the kids busy.  Selections are seasonal, plus you can make your own custom pizza.  I only wish that they had home delivery."}
{"text":"Really good specialty pizzas. We did a half meatball half chicken BBQ and it was very tasty. A medium split between 2 people is a decent serving. Atmosphere was nice, but we were there shortly after they opened on a Sunday so it wasn't very crowded. I would imagine weekend nights are jammed."}
{"text":"Dewey's! It's a nice, fun place with a very family-friendly atmosphere. I love taking my 5-year-old charge here; he can watch the chefs make pizza in the back for such a long time! Which is a convenient distraction, because if you come on a weekend night,  you might be waiting for a very long time. 

The food is good. I don't carry many strong feelings about pizza unless it's a complete and utter foodgasm, so this gets a solid 3-stars. Nothing sacred, but it's made very well. The crust is yummy! They also have a very awesome selection of toppings to choose from. Dewey's is better than any crappy chain pizza, if only for the fact that you can get roasted red peppers, fresh basil, and goat cheese on your pizza. Which I greatly recommend.

Aside from the pizza, I LOVE the salads. The house salad is delicious, with pine nuts and goat cheese and yummy balsamic vinaigrette dressing. They also have a nice selection of local, seasonal desserts. 

In summation, lots of toppings + fun, slightly-more-upscale-than-a-typical-pizzeria atmosphere = happy!"}
{"text":"These guys have been awesome for years to us.  The service is always consistently great and the food is amazing.  Derek went as far today to make a little homemade gift of congrats on a special day we were having.  They just don't have places like this anymore and we appreciate it.  Highly recommend! The walnut grape salad is amazing.  Impossible not to love."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with their Bronx bomber. This is my favorite place to get pizza in Cleveland. They have a thinner crust that is just right. They use great ingredients and it is never too greasy. Great service and they have excellent salads to compliment the pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. The staff is great and the customer service is amazing. That's the reason why we always come back. 10 star not 5!"}
{"text":"My newest favorite place for pizza! I never had a bad pizza here. The crust is on the thinner side which I like & they have a lot of toppings to choose from. The sausage & pepperoni pizza is my favorite. Personally, I think it beats Angelo's...but that's just me."}
{"text":"I truly LOVE Dewey's. The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. Substitutions are a breeze with them and they've never made a mistake. 

I also love how they always offer paper plates and napkins -- like a mom away from home :) 

The Green Lantern is my ultimate favorite (with pepperoni). Holy smokes!!! The toppings are so fresh and the crust is the perfect amount of soft and crispy."}
{"text":"Delicious salads and succulent pizza! The pizza dough is delicious. Nice atmosphere and excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Wowsas, what a delicious pizza!! Would love to try this again. We tried 4 of the specialty pizzas and all 4 were amazing!! We also got a couple of the salads, which were great but tiny. I would recommend getting bigger salads if you plan on sharing."}
{"text":"This pizza is possibly my favorite. A friend an I decide to crest our own pizza with smoked cheddar, bacon, and BBQ sauce all on a white sauce and thin crust pizza. I was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty and cheap!  I agree with others who said it is a little bland, but thats what I like about a good, standard pizza joint.  This place is spotlessly clean, you can watch the guys in back make the pizza, and the ingredients are fresh.  There are a LOT of options for pizza in Cleveland, but being from St. Louis, it was nice to find a place that is just like it is at home."}
{"text":"Try the Billy Goat Pizza. It's fan-frakking-tastic!

On the surface, I thought I would really enjoy Ryan's Inferno pizza, but the menu failed to mention it's covered in blue cheese. While that might be a plus for some, I personally don't dig on moldy cheese, which kinda ruined the pizza for me.

Great pizzas all around and very family friendly. They could use some more air-conditioning though."}
{"text":"Lets talk Pizza!!!

We love pizza in our house and wanted to try something different. So, we went to Deweys. 

We got some beers and 2 pizzas. They were both incredible. The fig sauce on the one went perfectly with everything. Even our drinks! The other pizza was the Dr Dre and yeah, quite possible the best thing I've put in my mouth in a long time ( stop the giggles) it was amazing! Cooked perfectly to give it a nice crunch. 

Pizza isn't supposed to be boring and these were far from boring pizzas. So much flavor and crunch. It was the perfect evening to enjoy something new. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Om nom nom! Dewey's Pizza is an experience! Dine in or take-out only. No Delivery (sad face). 

I highly recommend the Socrates' Revenge pizza. Its thin crisp crust, ooey gooey cheese, and salty yummy-ness makes it my personal favorite. The salads here are large enough to share, though you wont want to. And to top it all off they serve a selection of local and beyond, sometimes seasonal, often micro-brew beers. 

The staff was super helpful the first time we went, explaining everything in a quick and concise manner. They have no problem making half one thing and the other another.

A great neighborhood location, and it will get crowded late enough in the evening!"}
{"text":"deweys. LOVE it. 
pizza choices are amazing.
salads are great as well.
the dressings are or i should say taste home made.
crust is on the thinner side for the pizza, but i am A-ok with this.
family friendly.
great for a big party.
i truly like deweys. it has a fun atmosphere. the pizza is delish and will continue to frequent them!"}
{"text":"Dewey's is the quintessential go-to pizzeria for the individual that wants something a bit more artisan than your typical slice. It has a casual, clean and fresh ambiance that really makes you feel at home.

The pizza is thin crust with a myriad of unique topping combinations. My favorite is the Edgar Allen Poe and The Billy Goat. Great options for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. The beer list is also solid with about 8 quality craft beers on tap. 

Casual, family friendly atmosphere with no frills great pizza."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding, and they make you feel pretty special for just eating some pizza. Then again, this isn't just any pizza. The hand tossed crust and fresh ingredients make all the difference.  Great atmosphere doesn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"Dewey's Pizza is the greatest pizza in all of the land. 
Dewey's Hawaiian is my choice for my death row last meal. 
Enough said.
Oh yeah!  I just remembered when yelp asked if Dewey's was good for kids. 
You can bring your kids, but how about you not let them run around like animals?
They won't die if you tell them 'no' once in a while. Nobody thinks your brats are cute."}
{"text":"Dewey's is one of my favorite places in the land of the Cleve for pizza.  You have to try the Green Lantern.  Their delicious crust topped with pesto, artichokes, mushrooms and goat cheese all yummy and gooey.  It is probably my favorite specialty pizza around.  Though in all honesty, all of the specialty pizzas I've had there are yum yum!  The meatball pizza is covered in delicious meatballs, perfectly seasoned without any gristle or grease.  Really, any pizza you get here is going to be great because their crust itself is amazing to begin with.  Anything on top of that is deliciousness.

In addition to their great pizzas, their salads are also amazing!  In the fall/winter, they have a Harvest salad which is out of this world.  It's worth going to this pizza place for just its salads and I promise you won't look like that weirdo ordering a salad at a pizza place.  The portions are very generous.  With my four girlfriends, one regular salad and one large pizza is plenty enough to feed all of us with usually a slice of pizza to spare.

The service is also well done here.  My glass was never less than half full, and the server was always checking to make sure all was well.  I will definitely be back for more Dewey's!

P.S.  I'd give five stars if they delivered.  What pizza place doesn't deliver??"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere of this sit down pizza shop. Loved how they let you split a pizza into two different types and both were definitely worth it."}
{"text":"First time here, for lunch. There was not a wait, and the place was very clean and welcoming. The staff was friendly and our server was attentive. I like that you can get 2 different halves for your pizza. I tried their seasonal (I cannot remember the name) that had brussel sprouts, bacon, 2 kinds of cheese and I think onion on it- and it was really good! The other half was my favorite though, the porky fig. Just the perfect amount of sweet fig taste with salty prosciutto flavor...seriously SO good. The pizza dough was cooked perfectly, soft but done just enough. I definitely plan on ordering carryout pizza from here, and returning to the restaurant again soon as well. I'm glad Fairlawn has a unique pizza place like this instead of another boring chain. :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  The Don Corleone is my favorite.  Very tentative staff and the pizza came out hot."}
{"text":"I had the meatball pizza and a walnut salad. My food was very fresh. I had a local draft (a wheat beer). Everything was excellent. As others have noted, the staff is great. They have a fantastic service awareness as well. It reminded me of the \"Pikes Seafood\" in Seattle that made videos of choose your attitude don't let your attitude choose you. Dewey's rotates waiters so you experience several while you're eating. One young woman could have been a stand up comic she was so hilarious. My encounter set the bar very high. I hope the can hit it again as it was incredible. Great job with fresh food and hiring exceptional employees!"}
{"text":"Awesome... Amazing... Dewey's in Cleveland Heights. The best pizzas, and salads, in the entire Heights area! Everyone is so friendly and the food is so good! Nice to sit at the bar and chat with the bartender while we wait for our order; we have a glass of wine (by knowledgeable recommendation) or beer while we wait, and the kids can have a soda and watch dinner be prepared through the window. This is really...fantastic...pizza!  SIGH....We are living back home in Cali again now and this is one of the things we miss the most: Dewey's. You guys are so lucky."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but would like the crust to be a little thinner. Some of the specials are worth trying even though they sound a little odd. The flavors they put together seem to work. Good service and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Always fantastic pizza and salads!  The service here is fast and attentive, always very friendly. If you are dissatisfied in any way, they work hard to make it right-altho we never have been."}
{"text":"We tried 4 different kinds of pizza on our first visit and lived every one of them! It's a little pricey, as far as pizza goes, but it's worth it. Great service. The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and was super sweet. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and service. I wish they had one in south Florida."}
{"text":"Fantastic white Caprice pizza with delicious Mozzarella and juicy baked tomatoes. Balanced combo of oil/bread. Overall just super fresh!

The staff here is always friendly and even entertaining. Always a good experience, but the Caprice pizza I ordered last night was the best Caprice I've had in a long time from anywhere!"}
{"text":"What a surprisingly awesome place. I've heard a lot about Dewey's from friends on the East Side and decided to check out the Lakewood location. Definitely family-friendly, but also low-key enough to accommodate dudes who were just there for pizza and beer. 

I'm not usually a huge fan of non-traditional pizza toppings, but the Ryan's Inferno (at least I think that's what it's called) with veggies and Buffalo-ed chicken was pretty freaking good. Thumbs up to this place."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing.  After being disappointed by overhyped places in Little Italy, I was very happy to finally find a go-to pizza place in Cleveland.

The crust here is pretty good; it's not too crispy thin or excessively doughy thick.  There are plenty of toppings for building your own custom pizza and they'll accommodate plenty of picky eaters.  In addition to the wide array of toppings, Dewey's offers a bunch of fantastic combinations that mix and match different flavors and textures.  I had the Billy Goat (no green peppers though) and was sold on the combination of sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and fresh tomatoes.  The Caprice offered a classic, fresh margherita pizza while Socrates Revenge was great vegetarian blend of spinach, olives, and onions.  Ryan's Inferno was unique buffalo chicken pizza, which was a welcome change from the BBQ chicken pizza (which is also available).

In addition to good food, Dewey's has a delicious beer selection for mixing and matching drinks with your pie.  Service is fantastic and food comes out as quickly as pizza can realistically bake -- so remember to be patient; the wait is well worth the gluttony.  I fully plan on coming back to Dewey's and would highly recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing calzone from Dewey's. I got a simple sausage, pepperoni, and onion, and it was baked to perfection. There aren't many places in Cleveland where you can find a good calzone. These are huge, so come hungry."}
{"text":"Dewey's is one of my favorite pizza places.  It's definitely one of the best in Cleveland.

I have never eaten anything at Dewey's that I didn't like (salad, pizza, calzones, and dessert).  The staff is extremely attentive, but never annoying.  I feel like this is also the least greasy pizza I've ever had, which I really like.  The crust is excellent and it never gets gross or soggy from grease.  Most importantly, it reheats really well at home!

The waiting area gets cramped because it's a pretty popular place on the weekend, but there are big windows allowing you to watch the kitchen at work, making the wait more bearable.

I consider Dewey's to be more of a gourmet pizza restaurant though; if you want an authentic and/or Italian experience you should look elsewhere.  This also isn't the most inexpensive pizza around, not that the prices are unreasonable.  The cost does prevent me from eating here more often, but I still highly recommend Dewey's."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting pizza. Friendly environment. Best pizza I've ever had. Thin, crunchy slices. No better pizza then this. Salads are good. Fresh ingredients and you can even watch them make the pizza fresh"}
{"text":"We were here for an early dinner on a Saturday night, and I was overall very impressed. 
Parking right next to the restaurant is very slim, but there is a parking garage about a block away. The restaurant is very clean, and is just one wide open room with tables and booths. You can see the kitchen through a glass window. 
The servers were attentive and friendly. 
Their menu consists of salad, pizza, and calzones. No appetizers or anything else. They have a great local beer selection on tap. We ordered a salad and a pizza. The salad was pretty good - nothing too special, but good. The pizza was delicious. It was a pretty thin crust with good fresh toppings. I will definitely come back for the pizza. 
By the time we left the restaurant it was packed, with a wait. I think every table had at least one kid at it- so a very family friendly place."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars however we just moved to the Heights and we've tried to go to this location about 3 times now.  Every single time I've had to back out of their parking lot.  It is awful.  And the street parking is always taken around the restaurant.  Finally I went to a lot specifically meant for parking which is not a long distance away, however in the middle of winter, very COLD to walk.  

We finally placed a pick up order.  We had a pizza with half x-pepperoni and half the southwestern BBQ.  I highly enjoyed the BBQ and I absolutely love their crust."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and food 90% of the time. The atmosphere is great. However the last few times I have ordered take out, my pizza is not fully cooked, the cheese isn't fully melted and the crust is really light in color and doughy! I always end up cooking it longer at home before I eat it."}
{"text":"The BEST specialty pizza you will find in northeast Ohio is at Dewey's! We are regulars here and this is why: 1) amazing pizza. They make the dough fresh (you can watch them tossing the dough through the glass if you want to!) and the toppings are super fresh, too. The best pizza we've had there is a seasonal that is available May/June called the \"Tito Santana\". When that's not available, we get the meatball and the Ryan's inferno. Yum yum yum! 2) Their salads are phenomenal -- freshly made dressings, creative combinations (love the harvest especially). 3) their service is fabulous. they are constantly keeping drinks filled and checking in. Everyone we've ever met there seems very happy and takes great care of us. 4) Good beer options 5) Atmosphere -- cozy tables are close together, but not stifling. 

The only cons I can think of are 1) everyone seems to love this place, so it gets very crowded! We often have to wait (but it's worth it). 2) parking is tough because this is a very congested area (lots of bars and other restaurants nearby). We usually park on Graber Drive, or in the alley behind Dewey's."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza,  great salads,  friendly place,  and all of that,  for sure.  

But the server placed the pizza a little off-center on the thingy that keeps the pizza elevated.  And splat,  pizza falls off on me,  the seat,  and the floor.  

Manager shows up: \"I've ordered another one from the kitchen,  it will be here soon\". Never asked if we wanted another one,  so I think ok,  they realize it's their fault. 

Guess what?  Check arrives,  asshole manager charged me for both pizzas.  I asked the server,  is that intentional,  or is this a mistake?  She is speechless,  and says \"I'll send you the manager.\"

Well asshole manager wants to know if it was really the server's fault, because he thinks I like to dump my pizza on the bench and on the floor.  

At least if he had said he wanted to charge me for the pizza he ordered,  I would have td him to forget it.  But no, he orders a pizza and wants me to pay for it. 

Asshole. Good pizza,  but lousy service. 

Make sure to review your check before paying,  who knows what the manager will order for you."}
{"text":"Great specialty pies and some of the best salads in town. Dewey's never disappoints. Good for families. They have a big window where you can watch the kitchen cooking up your finely crafted pie. It gets crowded for dinner and on weekends but the wait goes quickly. Full bar with a surprisingly good wine list and lots of local drafts available 
My hubby is a carnivore so he got half a pie loaded with meats while the other half was Socrates Revenge for me.  Feta cheese, green and black olives, onion.  Greek galore!   So tasty and served up fresh.  My daughter always gets the Hawaiian pizza. 
Dining room is spacious. Public parking just at the corner and lots of street parking available. Its a popular neighborhood hangout for families."}
{"text":"Dewey's is super-fast if you can survive the endless wait in their awkward corridor.  Even seated in the waiting area, I was always in the way of the servers.

We had the Peppercorn ranch salad w/ parmesan together, and  the Green Lantern pizza with pepperoni, sausage and oregano.  It was crispy and tasty all over, and hit the spot for values of New York style.  

We also gave the triple layer chocolate cake a go, along with a Fathead IPA.

Ve'll be back - just not during the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Glad we have a Dewey's on the west side now. Enjoy the Green Lantern Pizza!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their salads! I wonder if they bottle their dressings because I would buy it! First time having the green lantern pizza and it was amazing. Get white sauce instead of red!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out for Sunday evening football.  Located in a hip area with several restaurants and bars nearby.  Got 2 veggie styles, bbq chicken, and a meat lovers.  All were thoroughly enjoyed.  Small parking area and street parking available.  Has dining area at venue.  I believe they serve beer and wine.  Excellent  pizza!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the two ladies greeted us with smiles!  (Didn't get their names: one with glasses, other short blonde hair) We ordered take out; create your own calzone & a side salad. Total was $15 because of a tip. Definitely worth it for our first time! Will definitely be back to dine in. Food is delicious. Thanks Yelp! & Dewey's!"}
{"text":"first time here .. with all the great pizza in Lakewood this place has stiff competition .. ended up here opting to not wait nearly an hour for a seat at Angelo's (the BEST in Lakewood) due to it being 1/2 price pizza Monday .. first of all? .. ZERO appetizers? .. What is up w/that? .. I understand the concept of wanting to keep a small vs huge menu but no wings? .. no mozz sticks? .. not even garlic bread? .. $5.95 for a side salad is outrageous .. how about offering a simple garden salad for a bit less? .. the pizza was edible but nothing I would rush back for .. the crust tasted \"generic\" & the toppings nothing to brag about (pepperoni + sausage on our table) .. the staff while friendly was at our table every 3 minutes to ask a question .. remove something from the table or just to observe our progress .. we counted & had 8 different people at our table in a 45 minute dining experience .. when we ordered dessert (which honestly I was shocked they offered considering being void of appetizer choices other than over priced salads) we ended up w/the wrong dessert being brought to the table & then were given a look of surprise as if we made the mistake .. dessert did not disappoint in terms of taste once the proper order hit the table .. may end up returning in a pinch .. just won't make a sprint along Detroit Road to do it .."}
{"text":"Our new pizza place. I see no reason to go anywhere else.
We started our meal with each getting a salad. My fiance who is a salad person ordered the harvest salad. And the first words out of her mouth we i would come back here just for this salad. I had the ranch salad which was equally as good. Were off to a great start here and was excited to try the pizza next
The best part is the fact that you can mix and match pizzas. Doesnt matter if its red or white, which no lie kind of blew my mind. I know some places have a heart attack if you tell them not to add something to a specialty pie. So this was a nice change of pace.
We had the monthly special which was the taco pizza and the fig pizza. I dont remember the menu names but both were outstanding. The taco has fresh veggies, a spicy sauce and great ground beef. The fig and prosuccto pizza was sweet and salty and a great combo. Would order a whole pie for myself next time im here. Cant wait till we can come back and try different pizzas."}
{"text":"Any and every Dewey's I've been to has been wonderful from the service to the food. Some of my favorites are the candied walnut and grape salad and the green lantern pizza. Also, there's the Cuban pizza monthly special - to die for! This is a Ohio chain I Love to support!"}
{"text":"If you love pizza and you either live in Cleveland or you're visiting, you NEED to eat at Dewey's. I've been here tons over the 8+ years that I've lived in Cleveland and literally every time, the service is friendly and timely and the food is on point, even the monthly special pizzas. I always share a regular size salad (good for 2-3 people) with about 2 large pizzas between 3-5 people. Some of my favorite staple pizzas is the Edgar Allan Poe and Green Lantern. The crust is not too thin and not too thick and just the right amount of crisp. Go and try!"}
{"text":"Dewey's is my favorite place to get pizza in Cleveland.  The crust has just the right amount of crispness, and the toppings are always very fresh.  The combinations they have all are pretty good.  The bbq chicken is one of my favorites.  They also have really good calzones.  They basically fold half of a medium size pizza and stuff it full of sauce, 2 cheeses, and 3 toppings of your choice (either premium or regular, which makes it a good deal).  The calzones themselves are under $10, and I usually have to take half home because it's so big.  As for the actual toppings, there's a wide selection to choose from.

I also like their salads.  Very fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Their seasonal Harvest Salad in the fall is to die for. My favorite pizza is the Bronx Bomber: a classic mix of pepperoni, mushroom, onion, green pepper. Amazing. This is a family place, so bring the kids! 5/5 stars. My family loves this place."}
{"text":"Truly gourmet pizza with some delicious topping combinations. Quick service, great staff and can accommodate large groups of ten or more. I like the crust, it's not too doughy and not too crisp, just perfect! Great place for family dining or a take out."}
{"text":"I love pizza. Who doesn't?  It's polarizing though. So many different tastes out there. I drove 30 minutes because of the reviews and interesting menu. 

It's a great menu. You can even modify the specialty pizzas. I am sure I wouldn't let people mess with these and just let them create their own from the build your own section. The staff and service are outstanding.  

I ordered a terrific house side salad and I combined 2 specialty pizzas into a 1/2 and 1/2. Wild Mushroom and Green Lantern. I ordered both with red sauce even though the mushroom usually comes with white. I think their red sauce is too spicy. The crust is tasty and comes out properly baked, not exactly crisp but browned nicely. There's not enough top heat in their oven. The tops aren't cooked enough. The mushrooms are raw and shouldn't be. I didn't really defect a medley. All I saw were regular white button mushrooms. I liked the green lantern better but again wish the top was cooked a little more. 

It's good pizza. I would maybe go back and perhaps ask them to bake mine longer. I would also try the white sauce instead of the over seasoned red."}
{"text":"We had the House Salad and a Bronx Bomber.

The House Salad is delicious. Pine nuts, cranberries, and goat cheese - in addition to a beautiful vinaigrette. It's a 5-star salad.

The Bronx Bomber is good, but not out of this world. It's a solid pizza, but nothing I would rave about - maybe 3.5 stars. 

Oddly enough, go to Dewey's for the salad, not the pizza."}
{"text":"Wonderful service from the multitude of staff working on Saturday and the food was amazing as always!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, especially considering all the pizza options in Cleveland. However it's a great place for a group setting and the pizza is certainly good. Plenty of options on the menu as well. And they serve some good craft beers!!"}
{"text":"Dewey's has amazing salads, and I have gone there just for salad on many occasions. They're a great price for the excellent, fresh, creative toppings, and go far and beyond pretty much any restaurant salad I can remember. 

I sadly don't like the pizza, and am torn on how to rate this place. I'll say it's a 5 for the salads and good beer selection, but a 2 for the pizza. I wish I liked the pizza more, and find joy in all types of pizza, but just don't enjoy theirs."}
{"text":"I came here before Trivia Night for a quick bite to eat with the gals. Margot was our waitress. She handled our table of 8 with ease. She was attentive and prompt. 

I ordered the Strawberry Macadamia Nut Salad. It is mixed greens, strawberries, blue cheese, macadamia nuts all tossed in a raspberry poppyseed vinaigrette. It was light and refreshing. 

Dewey's has the best pizza in Cleveland! It is a classic NYC style pizza, thin crust. I recommend Porky Fig or Edgar Allan Poe!"}
{"text":"Had two creative combinations, the \"Green Lantern\" and the \"Dr. Dre,\" both were simply awesome, and what's even more amazing is the pizza was room temperature by the time it got home (they don't offer delivery) so it must be even more fantastic when hot."}
{"text":"Good pizza place with having Little Italy just couple blocks down the road. I like the option to have half and half pizza. Servers are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Being a New Yorker, I dare say Dewy's Pizza is almost as good, enough said!  Service is always A+, ingredients are always fresh and the pizza crust is to die for."}
{"text":"stumbled in after some day drinking... Nice and frienfly staff.. had half taco pizza and half mushroom.. overall the pizza was real good.. id go back.it came with some mexi ranch sauce for the taco pizza.. lettuce came on the side which was nice.. but they didnt have guac or sour cream?!?!  Thats a must for any mexican food, thats why i gave 4 stars"}
{"text":"How could you not love a place with menu items titled \"Edgar Allen Poe,\" and \"Green Lantern?\" I came here with a group of friends and LOVED it. After having Guys Pizza stuffed down my throat for years since it's always the choice for last minute meals with friends, Dewey's was a refreshing change of pace. The flavors are bold and the experience is fun, since you can split your pie, making choosing just one style a thing of the past. I agree with other reviewers that wait times and prices can be exorbitant. However, the deliciousness of the meal is certainly worth it, in my opinion. They don't skimp on the toppings (like I've often noticed with Guys Pizza), and the service is very good. If they delivered, they'd become my new midnight craving speed dial entry :)"}
{"text":"This is definitely some solid pizza. Yeah, I guess you could call it NY style. I'm not huge on chains, but I guess it's a smaller chain and it is SO close to my house, which bumps up my rating a little bit. Probably my new pizza joint. For an XL it's $16, which is worth it- it's huge and tastes just as good from the fridge the next day =)"}
{"text":"It's clean, the service is attentive and the menu is pretty simple. Pretty much salads or pizza. I wish the pizza was good, but it's really marginal. It's a far cry from Mama Santas, but I don't live close to Little Italy."}
{"text":"Dewey's is right around the corner from me so it tends to be the go-to quick pizza spot for my household. It's a chain and all, but it's based in Ohio, so eating there is kinda shopping local, right? 

You can get a regular plain-Jane pepperoni pizza here, and it's as good as the next place's, but what Dewey's really does well are specialty pizzas. I'm a big fan of the \"white\" pizzas -- for example, the Socrates' Revenge or the Edgar Allan Poe. Roasted garlic goodness! You can split pizzas too, so if you can't decide between two varieties you can go half and half. I'd personally recommend not mixing a red-sauce pizza with one of the white ones, though...just a little much going on in that case.

There are always a few good beers on tap, and the salads are served in generous portions and, again, with interesting toppings and dressings.

Service is friendly, they're usually playing pretty interesting music, and turnaround is usually relatively quick. It seems family-friendly, too -- you'll often see large family parties here. All in all, a solid place for pizza in the Heights."}
{"text":"I love Dewey's!  Been there multiple times, but decided to get carry out this past Saturday and thought it warranted a review.  Ordered 2 calzones and 2 salads.  The calzones were perfectly cooked, hot and very flavorful.  The salads are really what I love to rave about though.  I had the Caesar salad.  I just love the croutons which are more like mini-garlic bread slices.  The dressing isn't watered down and it's just downright tasty.  Hubby got the candied walnut and grape with balsamic vinaigrette and it was very good.  Price tempted me to give 4 stars, but I just can't because it's just that good!  This review specifically for the Lee Road location."}
{"text":"The pizzas are amazing and customizable. I did takeout and called ahead because I knew it would be busy. When I got there they had my pizza, plates, and utensils all to go! The best part was when I opened the pizza box at home and found little packets of crushed red peppers and parmesan cheese.

I would recommend getting their special pizzas (if you want to try more than one just ask them to do half and half)."}
{"text":"As close to ny style pizza as I've gotten in Cleveland so far. But it's got Los Angeles pricing and sometimes it can have that \"zesty\" sauce which I don't like. But the crust was perfect! And normally that's where pizzerias go wrong. This Dewey makes pizza crust light and chewy like it ought to be. Now if you can get that overdose of oregano and black pepper out of the sauce we are gonna be in 4 star territory! However the LA pricing and the zesty sauce brings us to a 3 star. Sorry I'm hyper critical of pizza so that's how I call it.

12/31/12 update - on a 2nd trip I asked for no added spices to the pizza- she mentioned that the sauce would have some already - I said fine just dont add more. and the pizza came out perfect!! so that DID happen on the 3rd visit too (the tie breaker) so I now up this to four star - cuz while its not exactly NYC pizza its pretty close!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.....Cuban!  I'm a pizza snob and I have to say this was an outstanding pie.  Not only culinary inventive but savory and delicious!!!  I shall return!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really sure how to \"star\" this place. 

2nd time there in 5 years. I don't remember the first.

Yesterday, went there, no wait, that was a nice surprise. But odd being a Saturday at 7:30. 

Opted to go with half Hawaiian, half Seasonal. 
The seasonal side was great. The Hawaiian is lacking. It was basic with a piece of ham and pineapple thrown on top. Not ever how I have had it before. Very little sauce on the pizza and was bland at best. 

Waitress was great. But the other staff were annoying coming to the table every five minutes to clean up. For god sake, let us eat! The one best part was the Peppercorn salad. Simple and tasty. 

I truthfully thing the Hawaiian needs work, perhaps see how Angelo's prepares it and go from there. 

Not in too big of a rush to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"FRESH, PERFECT CRUST!!! 
I have tried lots of pizza and Dewey's is hands down my favorite. Why you ask? Let's start with the crust. It's shiny. It's fluffy yet crispy and it crunches but also feels pillowy soft. Your mouth gets two satisfying textures from the light crunchy and airy dough. And I don't know how they get it perfect every time. They have the time in the air versus the time in the oven down to a science. Because this pizza is hand tossed---you can even watch while they make your pizza!
Now the toppings, Simple to get those perfect, right?? Wrong. Often times the veggies on pizza aren't fresh, the meat is too greasy or the toppings make the pizza soggy, either Bc of moisture or Bc they overload the crust. The toppings here are perfect. The ratios between the toppings is great and they are evenly spread, this is important to the making of a good pie! 
Please do yourself a favor and go!! And try something new! Their pizza suggestions on the menu have never done me wrong. 
Atmosphere and low key--nothing fancy--but nice place, clean, nice servers that have always been attentive. My last one even brought a new lemon wedge with each water refill.
Keep doing what you're doing Dewey's!"}
{"text":"Dewey's is my favorite place fore specialty pizza. If your coming here it's not for a plain pepperoni pizza. Your pizza is going to be out of the ordinary and your gonna love it. Maybe you'll pair it with a seasonal salad and you'll love that too. 

Others love Dewey's too so don't be surprised if there is a wait. Fortunately last night (Thursday) we got a table right away. 

I've like everyting I've tried at Dewey's but I'm here for one thing: the Edgar Allen Poe pizza! It's essentially a white pizza with kalamata olives, goat cheese, roasted garlic, and tomatoes. calling it amazing is an understatement. 

Minus one star for beer mix ups and not being to knowledgable on their drafts."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.. a little bland to me. The environment inside of dewey's in Lakewood is very open and spacious and would be a good place to visit and have some drinks. I definitely think Angelo's is a better pizza pie."}
{"text":"I liked everything about this place, EXCEPT for the pizza.The place looked clean, had nice decor; service was friendly and prompt but not overbearing, and our salads tasted fresh. Our pizza, however, left much to be desired. We ordered a pizza that had green peppers as a topping, and I was a little puzzled and curious when the pizza arrived and the toppings  were uncooked. I figured that maybe this was the way they \"do\" pizza-- a trademark of sorts. However, my first bite revealed a pizza that was undercooked. The outer edges of the pizza were warm, but that's about it. The rest of the pizza was lukewarm, as if it hadn't been cooked long enough (which is why the veggies were raw). It was just like eating frozen pizza that was taken out of the oven too soon. Unfortunate, because the outer edgees if the crust itself were  tasty. I'm giving this reatuarant two stars for the nice ambiance and  good salads, but would give zero stars for the pizza."}
{"text":"This place is great. I judge a place on the atmosphere, service, and food. This place has it all. Waitress Brianna was great and not afraid to hold a conversation. The pizza make interacted with my son through the window and he loved it. And the pizza was great. Not to much crust and the toppings where great."}
{"text":"The best pizza I've ever had.

The staff is nice and they change up their beer selections regularly. The kids can stand on chairs and watch the cooks make the pizza. The cooks will sometimes playfully throw flour at the glass and surprise the kids. Big fun.

But the pizza is the real deal. SO good. Also, their calzones and salads are top shelf too.

Parking is pretty limited in their small parking lot but you can always park in the decks across the street. Totally worth it though."}
{"text":"I'm not a fancy pizza expert. Tasty, giant slices with awesome ingredients. Haven't had a bad pie yet. Also had the Harvest salad for the first time; amaaaaazing. Also good low key service which is my favorite type of service."}
{"text":"Dewey's, both in Lakewood and in Cleveland Heights, is well worth checking out. A stylish place to have pizza and wine, or beer, without either a tavern or wine bar feel. It is something perfectly in the middle with really, really good pizza. Clean, well-lit, good service. Won't break the budget either."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and cleanliness A+. Was not the biggest fan of the pizza C-, softest pizza i've ever eaten which was weird, they seem to focus a lot on the dough and not on the toppings. Dough felt almost under-cooked."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and salads! It has become our favorite place for pizza. They have seasonal pizzas and salads - always worth trying. Great service model. All the servers rotate around the dining room to make sure every table is given attention."}
{"text":"Been here 5 or 6 times always has been great. My last visit was disappointing. I love the Meatball Specialty pizza, but on this visit it was borderline pathetic. The crust was so thin and soggy it could not not even hold the tiny bit of cheese and meatballs on top of it. The last few pieces were pretty much ruined because they were stuck to the cardboard pan it comes on. 50 bucks for a family of four at a pizza joint, I expect better. FYI, there is no parking, prepare to park on a side street somewhere and walk a bit. Not ideal for older people and those zero degree winter nights."}
{"text":"Mmm, mmm, MMM! So delicious. We dig into it so happily that I did t even get a picture. This is going to be our pizza spot when we're in town. The Edgar Allen Poe is so flavorful and delicious!! Also, they have the best tasting and texture gluten-free crust of anywhere I've tasted, and since pizza is my favorite food, I've tasted plenty. They are definitely \"Taking Pizza to the Next Level\"!"}
{"text":"if you don't like too much base, this is a good choice. The service there is good and you can see how they make their pizza. I ordered a 13 inch medium size customized pizza. They told me they have 17 inch for 3-4people. I would like to try one in the future. In a word, their pizza is thin base with good stuff and tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Really bad pizza, but what do you expect from a mall. I got a Don Corleone takeout. Oversized burnt toppings on top of half baked cheese and dough. Really cheap and gross sauce. A lot of better pizza nearby."}
{"text":"Had a small meatball pizza.  Very delicious and fast service.  Sat at bar and had a very friendly gentleman take my order, and a nice waitress who kept my glass full very regularly.  I would certainly go back if I lived here"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch.  Parking wasn't easy but I did find one empty spot right out in front.  Sitting there for a minute wondering if I was going to have to get change inside for the meter, the car behind me pulled out, so I just backed up, and they had 51 minutes left for me!  Problem solved.
The place is layed out different in that when you walk in you can't see the dining area, just a narrow hallway straight ahead.  Halfway down you turn left to wander around the back side of the bar and into the dining area.
I ended up having the place to myself except for one other couple.
Tried the traditional pizza with half red and half white sauce since they both sounded interesting.
Got pepperoni, whole roasted garlic & onion on both sides.
Both sides tasted great, and not really that different.  If I concentrated I could pick out the different nuances of the sauces, especially since my server told me about the different ingredients.  The main thing was that the red was a little bit spicier.  Has some red pepper flakes ground up in it.
The crust was a little thinner than is normally my preference, but that wasn't a problem with this one.  It had the perfect taste, texture and crunch.
I took half of it with me to have for dinner, and the crust was still just as good 5 hours later.
My server was excellent and happy to work there; always a good sign.  He knew the whole menu by heart, and knew what to recommend.
Found out that the owner is part of the family that owns the st Louis Cardinals."}
{"text":"To give this place anything short of five stars wouldn't be fair. Love the glass window in the kitchen, with the guys throwing dough. The kids watch that, allowing the adults to talk and visit and drink. Pizza is great and salads are even better. Long wait for table on Fridays."}
{"text":"Great selection of unique pizzas. You can do half and half with different types of pizza. Toppings are very fresh. The service is amazing - they are very attentive and friendly.

I've eaten there at least 50 times and have never had a bad experience. Definite 5 stars!"}
{"text":"People who eat gluten free pizza know that pretty much every place in Cleveland that offers them uses the same rice flour crust, but for some reason, Dewey's tastes ten times better than it seems to anywhere else! Theirs is crispy on the edges and with good flavor/consistency, making it a perfect vehicle for the rather gourmet toppings used at this neighborhood pizza joint. $11.95-$18.95"}
{"text":"Really good gourmet pizza. Don't just get what your normally would at another pizza shop. Has a really nice soft crust."}
{"text":"My apologies for sounding like a broken record alongside the other reviews, but I'd give it 3 stars for the same reasons everyone else says:

Service is great. Attentive, knowledgeable, friendly servers make it a good experience. 
Decor is sharp & clean. 

The pizza is good, however when compared to other other pizza places around of the same caliber, this pizza comes out underneath. We had the Hawaiian and the Socrates Revenge. They were good, but nothing to go out of the way for. 

The worst part is the price. When compared to pizza places of the same caliber, this place is overpriced by a long shot. If you feel you must try it, then try it. But you could save yourself a few bucks going down the street to pizza fire for basically the same taste and quality."}
{"text":"Expensive and extremely mediocre. Sauce is bland and for such expensive pizza they should use mozzarella and not a mix with provolone."}
{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE!!! They were terrific with our large crowd.  Loved my food!!!! Very filling, terrific staff!"}
{"text":"This place is AWEZOME.  For serious.

Pizza is amazing.  I've tried most on the menu but I pretty much only get the Ryan's Inferno, now.  It's a non.traditional pie but they're the only ones that do something this different so well.  Salads are pretty good, too......there's a simple one with goat cheese and pine nuts and a vinaigrette.  They also do seasonal pizzas that are always worth trying.  You really can't miss here.  

They also have a great beer selection and usually switch a few taps up for seasonal beers.

One of the best things about Dewey's has nothing to do with food.....it's their music selection.  They play such a wide span of styles and genres and have some super esoteric tracks that you only hear at home or on Dylan's show on satellite radio."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza I have ever had. Period. I have been going to Dewey's for years with my friends and family and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them like 10 stars. Simple the best pizzas I've tried in Ohio . Pizza comes out super quick & brick over pizza . Highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service was great. Pizza was ok. Standard no dimension to the pizza sauce. No bread sticks. Only cheese pizza that they cut different but we didn't get it. They had some interesting pizzas but we didn't try them so maybe those are the winners. The kids enjoying watching the guys make and toss the pizzas."}
{"text":"Dewey's has grown on me -- a lot. Good pizza options for vegans; they even invite you to bring your own shredded vegan \"cheese\" for them to top your pizza with. But maybe their best menu items are outstanding salads. And the service couldn't be more efficient and friendly. I now officially love Dewey's."}
{"text":"Everyone, I am sure, has a favorite pizza style: the one way pizza is supposed to be. And that one style, for me, is the style I grew up with. Thick chewy crust at the edges, not too thick in the middle; sauce that is not too sweet, but not too tart; fresh ingredients that include onions and peppers with a bit of a crunch. 

Not too much on the menu.  Just pizza, salad, and only a few specialty combos. 

For me, this is it. 

Add to it a great setting, pleasant and perfectly attentive wait staff, and a nice selection of beers, and you've got something pretty darned close to perfect. 

I make sure I ask for the crust well done. 
And always add oregano and crushed red pepper. Because this is Ohio.  Where bold flavors are hard to come by."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, homemade pizza. Love the green lantern pizza! and all the salads are great. My go to is the candied walnut salad. All the dressings are fresh and tasty. This is one of my favorite pizza shops of all time. Worth the price."}
{"text":"Just what Dewey's should be- good service, great food. Went to Dewey's on Lee with about 6 people for some pizza on a Sunday night.

We shared a 17'' 1/2 Green Lantern and 1/2 Ryan's Inferno. Yum! I also had a side house salad. Love the creamy balsamic vinaigrette dressing. 

Dewey's didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"As far as gourmet pizza goes, this is the best tasting that I have ever had.  The crust is just right, the ingredients taste fresh, and the pizza is not soaked with grease.  I love that they allow you to get specialty half and half pizzas so you can try two different types of pizzas in one pizza and they let you swap out ingredients.  I love out minced garlic for swapping roasted whole garlic and mozzarella cheese for goat cheese whenever possible, delicious!  Their salads are also phenomenal, and even though I know I am going to gorge myself on pizza, I always end up ordering salad too because they taste that good.  My sister loves their parmesan cheese and I swear, she pours the whole container on her pizza; to each their own!

This place is great for kids because they can watch the pizza-makers toss and make the pizzas through a window and they always enjoy this.  My kids never seem to tire of this entertainment.  Every time I have been to this location, I have never had to wait for a table, but the parking lot next is very small so spaces are usually a problem.  The only other Dewey's that I have been to in Dayton was horribly packed and the wait was more than an hour on a Saturday evening; pretty much a nightmare and reminded me of the chaos of the Cheesecake Factory waits.  Therefore, this Cleveland location is my preferred Dewey's so far and whenever I am up visiting my sister, I always request a trip to get some garlic, goat cheese, and mushrooms on an awesome pizza at Dewey's."}
{"text":"Great establishment. Reasonable prices, very clean, amazing staff and good pizza and I am a native New Yorker.  Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed pizza connoisseur I have to say that I enjoyed this pizza and the whole experience at Dewey's.

Started with some salads. 
Greek salad with roasted red pepper dressing - um, can I buy that dressing in bulk? It was delicious and the salad had the perfect amount of sun-dried tomatoes and olives. 
Candied walnut and grape salad - husband had this and it was so delicious I didn't even get a bit to taste! I did taste the dressing though, sweet with a bit of bite - very nice. 

OK, now on to the good stuff. 
We ordered half Wild Mushroom and half Green Lantern. 
Overall the crust was nice and thin under the toppings with a perfect amount of chew but at the crust, it was nice and fluffy and not too crispy/burned. Yum. 
The mushrooms on the wild mushroom half were good, not too soggy as mushrooms sometimes get on pizza. 
The Green Lantern side had the red sauce - I loved the spice that the sauce had in it. The artichokes, garlic, and goat cheese were perfect. 

Service was actually great. Multiple people stopped by to see if we needed anything and my drink stayed full. Price was decent for dinner - $37 for two people including pizza, salad, and one beer. 

This was my first time at Dewey's but based on that experience, I am sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Dewey's is one of my favorite pizza spots in the cleveland area. We order from here often while at work and have also dined in a few times with a large party. The staff is always friendly and efficient. The make it your own calzones are amazing and large in size. I've tried several of their pizzas, which are all very good. A new favorite is the porky fig. I substituted the prosciutto for chicken and it was wonderful. I hear it's very good with the prosciutto as well. We will definitely continue to come here!"}
{"text":"This place in on point. 40+ going away party for a coworker. Sent a list of food from the menu before coming and they had everything ready and the service never slowed even through the lunch. And the Greek salad is the bees knees. That is all"}
{"text":"Places with really small menus have to be very good at what they do in order to make it... and Dewey's nails it.

The menu here is quite barren... a couple salads, calzones and pizzas.  Nothing else.  Fortunately, the pizza is spectacular.  The secret is clearly out, as during dinner the line can be rather significant.

The wife and I shared a large pizza with tomato, onion and basil... The pizza was bigger than I thought that it would be, which is good because nothing.. NOTHING beats left over pizza.  The pizza was almost perfect... it could have stood maybe another minute in the oven to crisp up the crust a tiny bit more, but that is just nit picking.  It was the best I've had so far in Cleveland.  The service is also quite friendly.  The place was packed, yet my drink was always refilled before empty.  That is how it should be done.

One minor gripe is that the beer prices are too high... 5$ plus beers should be reserved for the good stuff, not everything... I could go to a place like the winking lizard and have the same beer for $1 less.  Regardless, I look forward to returning for some more pizza goodness."}
