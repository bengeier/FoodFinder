{"text":"Pastries are great and so is the service! Prices are fantastic for the size of the pastry.  Haven't tried their empanadas yet but they look very professionally done.  Banana loaf was well made and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Love this gem! My mother is constantly going here and picking up their delicious empanadas for dinner. Upon her last visit she also brought home a few of their pastries. Long story short, I am currently obsessed with their crème brûlée.  I was so upset the Red Sailboat Bakery is gone, but make way for Marjo Bakery. The owners are from Uruguay and have trained for a long time to make those amazing pastries.  Everyone there is really nice and the price is so right. $2.50 for a latte or cappuccino in Toronto? Sign me up. Thumbs up all around."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon a new bakery in North York/Scarborough. They have only been open for a week or so but from the taste of the pastries and churros they definitely know what they are doing.  It is a small cafe style bakery which offers european style pastries, Argentinean empandas, and delicious churros.   It was a great find and hopefully they are here for a long time"}
