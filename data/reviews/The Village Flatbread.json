{"text":"Have ordered pizza from here quite a few times and it's always quick and delicious. One of the best gluten free crusts I've had, manages to hold up the weight of the toppings and doesn't get soggy. 

Try the Brittania and add banana peppers and chicken. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Just had our first pizza - the shaganappi - on recommendation, and it was delicious. I saw that gluten-free was available, and typically this means it might be safe. To learn that there is absolutely no gluten in any ingredients and the entire facility hasn't seen any gluten at all, let me order with confidence for my wife who lives with celiac disease. Service was excellent, friendly, and the actual time to bake was pretty quick. We will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"AMAZING. A MUST FOR GLUTEN-FREE EATERS. Also have delicious dairy free options.

The Village Flatbread should most definitely have more than 4 stars.  


Their salads are fresh, delicious, and super-food filled. 
The first time I tried them, I had a less than pleasant experience with SkiptheDishes (the driver left without verifying/receiving my full order and was just plain weird)  BUT their amazing food totally made up for it. 

The owner is absolutely lovely and called me personally to apologize. Beyond that, I have ordered 3 more times since then and have zero complaints - literally zero. They remember you, the staff are super nice, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this week. Friendly staff quickly prepared our order for take out. Shaganappi pizza was a winner. Gluten free crust was surprisingly tasty. They have dairy free and vegan options too which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Gf and df pizza is here! I will flare to gluten contamination and need to be dairy free. Village Flatbread has been our go to for pizza nights. My favorite is the vegan olive tapenade sauce pizza. Crust is nice and thin and you get quality here. Non gf friends have tried it and loved it, if you are feeling adventurous !"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza! Gluten free and dairy free finally found a place that has pizza I can eat.

Back again! Love the pizza."}
{"text":"Not only the best vegan pizza I've ever had, but the best pizza I've ever had! Quality and care."}
{"text":"Superb service and yummy food. Halal is a plus. 
Never seen such variety of flavors before in pizza styles."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have had - with or without gluten! Highly recommend to anyone. My husband is celiac and finding good gluten free food is such a pain ... Until now! We will definitely be coming back again and again! We ordered online delivery and it arrived exactly when requested :) Super friendly service and AMAZING food."}
{"text":"You will never beat the quality, price or exceptional service of this establishment! Wow! Best hole in the wall takeout pizza in western Canada -- try it! Fresh organic toppings, creative recipes and crunchy crunchy gluten free crust the whole family will love ... and crave.. over and over again. Makes me hungry just writing about it! 11/10

Oh, did I mention it's about $20 per larger pizza -- not $40"}
{"text":"Pizza sauce was too sour for my liking. They offer creative pizza selections, but it's a bit too spendy for what you get."}
{"text":"I wanted to try out this place because it only serves gluten-free pizza. I was grabbing some gluten free food for a friend that celiac and I know that cross-contamination is always a concern. I ordered the Brittania, Tuscany and Hillhurst.  I ordered half of the Brittania and Tuscany with vegan cheese.  I ordered the other for my friends. I liked that you can order online; pay and they send you an email with the time for pickup. They also do delivery. The vegan pizza was delicious. It was crispy and full of flavour.  It did not taste like a gluten free pizza at all.  This is now our favourite vegan pizza joint. We can't wait to try the other types of pizza."}
{"text":"I have experienced better pizza.
We ordered 2 pizzas, they were both simply BAD. Greasy and tasteless.
I wish we had ordered from one of the chain such as 73 or Dominos or...
I want to say we will go back and give them another chance, but I am not so sure..."}
{"text":"We ordered two pizzas and salad tonight to serve three. My daughter and I are Celiac and this is our favourite gf pizza. We are going to be regulars at Village. It's great pizza and no concerns about cross contamination. Thanks to the owners!"}
{"text":"Cozy and delicious. Was walking home and felt a bit hungry and decided to check out this place. I ordered a half Aspen pizza and a Boylan Black Cherry (my fav!) and pretty much saw the chef make it.

This pizza was so delicious and the cozy place made it that much more enjoyable. Will be back often.

100% gluten free and Halal, with vegan/dairy free options."}
{"text":"Finally a pizza place that caters to my dietary needs...that tastes good! Nice that you don't have to ask for gluten-free crust because they're all gf. The crust is thin, crispy but also soft, nice and light and doesn't really taste the way you think when you think of gf bread. The pizza was also ready pretty quick which was nice.

I had The Kensington and it satisfied my pizza craving. I'll be back!

Just a note, this place is small so it's more for take out. There are only a few tables and space is very limited."}
