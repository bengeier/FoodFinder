{"text":"This was a nice change from the norm.  I got one of the chicken dishes and it was quite flavorful.  It reminds me that there is so much variety in food.  I really enjoyed it and will visit again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I lived in Morocco for some time and have been craving good, authentic Moroccan food. With high hopes and good reviews, I finally went to this place. Aside from the fact that what we wanted was ignored, the food did not taste good. Everything in my couscous tasted overbearingly of bad tomatoes. What I ordered shouldn't have even had tomatoes. The couscous was clearly not made authentically either. I guess I'll continue my search for real Moroccan food..."}
{"text":"Really good Moroccan food. Not open on Monday's. Enjoy the fresh ingredients and authentic flavor."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Berber Chicken was as delicious as it sounded on the menu. Perfect blending of flavors and for dessert the Tahini Chocolate truffles just made me happy. You must try this place!"}
{"text":"3 words... I'm going back! I like to try new food whenever I return home to Charlotte, so I decided to give this place a try. The place is quaint, but a very nice place to grab a to-go dinner. I took a taste in the car, and couldn't wait to get home to finish! Soooo much flavor! And they will make your food as needed. You must try the Vegetables with chickpeas and the lamb will tip you over! Definitely struck gold here! You wont regret the money spent."}
{"text":"Great food! We asked for recommendations from the owner and he was right on.  We all loved our dishes! The food came really quick which is a bonus."}
{"text":"I have yet to try everything on the menu, so far Lamb Briouat, Falafel Sandwish, Humus and baklawa are the best you can find in town, you can't pass on."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered a variety of things to try it out. It was all good, but the chicken and apricot couscous (homemade!), the beef brochette, and the baklava were the highlights. Very, very excited to have it in the nighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow! So glad this place came to Plaza Midwood, it has so many Vegan options. My absolute favorite is the Eggplant Zaalouk appetizer, then follow it up with the Kama Veggie Tagine. End it with the Chocolate Truffles. The owner, Hamza was so helpful and described all the dishes in detail before making my choice. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had 3 dishes and all were excellent.  Inventive combinations of familiar flavors from the Middle East.  Good veggie and meat dishes.  This is a rare find.  Nothing to look at, but my favorite restaurants have usually been in sketchy neighborhoods, and bare bones cooking.  Ingredients are clean and fresh, if the neighborhood isn't.  But they're keeping it real and affordable.  Seating in or out is not a good option.  Take it home and enjoy it with a crowd.  Each dish will feed two, easily.  If you go out to eat for the food, go here.  If you want valet parking, starched table cloths, and think that's worth it a crappy meal, there are many overpriced choices."}
{"text":"Totally amazing food! Amazingly kind service which is rare these days! Food is a 10++++! You have to try this cozy place."}
{"text":"LOVE Ajbani!! Everything is super fresh and flavorful! I'm pretty picky- but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!! My favorite is Berber Chicken with Couscous, and the Tahini Chocolate Truffles are to die for :) Big portions, ready to pick up quick!! Definitely a place to check out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  And I love all of the vegan and GF options!  Probably more of a take-out place, but they have a cute seating area too."}
{"text":"Try the RAS chicken. End it with baklava. Both were my favorite. I knew it would be good but didn't expect myself to crave it again the next day!!  Will go next time and bring take out to my friends to try. Nom nom nom!!!"}
{"text":"Just ok and was a little underwhelming after the excitement to have a Moroccan place in town. Friendly staff but the cous cous side is small and the tagine lacked meat besides a few pieces."}
{"text":"Good food - the flavors are really strong and distinctive. Never had Moroccan food before, but I loved the food we had. Among the two of us, we opted for the Berber chicken and Hearty Veggies with Chickpeas. The host helped us pick the options out of the lot.

Good food - hopefully I'll get time to make more visits and try out the other alternatives."}
{"text":"Is this place closed???? Passed by yesterday and the sign was gone. Sign on the street said something like soul cafe???"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken and apricot + cous cous entree. Very tasty! Very much a takeout spot, but there were a few small tables to sit at. The food was prepared well and didn't take long at all. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian tagine to go! You get a ton of food for a good price. Nothing out of this world but it's a cute small place to get some Moroccan food. I went when it just opened up so it may have improved since it first opened."}
{"text":"Had the apricot rubbed chicken with root vegetables and couscous entree. Savory chicken, vegetables were a little dry but the flavors were satisfying. The portion was generous to share. This is a takeout only place so I suggest calling ahead. I'd like to try the desserts next time. The parking is limited too since they share a lot with three amigos next door."}
{"text":"We saw this place while driving on Central Avenue and went in as we love Moroccan cuisine. We were not disappointed. 

The woman at the counter was super friendly and accommodating even though it was 30 minutes from closing time. Everything was fresh and flavorful, with big portions. Definitely a place to check out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it. Spicy lamb was not spicy but chewy instead. Carrot and cucumber salad was mostly carrots. Three dips in one container mixed together into a terrible mush. Pita was hard as a brick. And it was painful to watch how slow they prepare already cooked takeout."}
{"text":"I was excited when I heard that a Moroccan place was opening nearby to me, so the wife and I came in this past Saturday to try it out. I had tried once before, but quickly found out that they are not open for lunch at all. Hours are 4-10pm only on the days that they are open. Anyway, we were warmly greeted and the concept and menu was explained to us in detail. I was given a small sample of the chicken dish, but ultimately decided on the spicy lamb. Since I love spicy, I inquired about the spice level, which I was informed was about 2 out 5. I usually go for 5 out 5, so I was given some harissa to add to my dish to kick up the spice level when I got home. I also got a tomato and caper salad appetizer. The wife being a non meat eater chose a couscous entree called hearty veggies with chickpeas and a veggie briouat, which is a fried phyllo dough appetizer.

All was expertly package for our to go order. They do have a few tables inside and outside, but it appears to mainly be a take out place. Prices were reasonable and we did get plenty of food to the point of me having a very generous plate of leftovers the next day when I finished everything. Overall the food was unique and had great flavor. The harissa really helped to kick up the spice level of the spicy lamb. There was one strange bite in my spicy lamb that was really intensely spicy, and I am not sure exactly what it was. I was possibly a smallish pepper, but I can't say for sure. Either way, I was not expecting it, so that was the main surprise. I had a few extra drinks of water and I was fine, but I know some people that would have been hurting for a while due to them not being able to handle high spice levels. It was weird because it was only one bite, and no other repeat visit from the spicy pepper? when I ate the leftovers. For the other dishes, the wife was not a fan of the tomato and caper salad and I was less a fan of the briouat, but her couscous dish was enjoyed by both of us.

All in all, a great addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to trying some other items in the future."}
{"text":"I had been craving Moroccan food for a long time and I did not think I would be able to get it in Charlotte.  Boy, was I wrong!  This place is primarily for take-out only.  The food is fantastic!  I got the traditional veggie and chickpease with braised lamb couscous.  They gave me the lamb for free, by accident.  I am so glad they did!  I don't like lamb usually, but this was so delicious.  The lamb just melts in your mouth.  Also, I got the beef with prunes and almonds tajine.  I am huge fan of sweet and savory, and this hit all of those notes.  So flavorful and such delicious beef!  For the appetizer, I got the lamb briouats.  It comes with the harissa with yogurt.  Be warned though, the harissa is SOOOO spicy!  I enjoy spicy foods, but this was too much.  Stick with the harissa with yogurt!  I can't wait to go back again when I visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This is so tasty!!! I had the hearty veggie with braised beef and couscous. I shared a couple of dishes with other friends too. I'll have to come back for different dishes! Chef Craig is a Johnson Wales graduate and partnered with Hamza, a fellow Morrocan to create some delicious food. Great location on Central Ave too!"}
{"text":"I tried the Berber Chicken and the Spicy Lamb Tajine. Loved both dishes and the meat was cooked to perfection! It's mostly a takeout restaurant so don't expect great ambience, but the food makes up for it. Great staff too!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with this spot. Picked up the Lamb Tagine with a side of couscous, Hummus app, and Harrisa.  Overall, this was probably the best hummus I have ever had and it was quite a large serving. There were really good vegetables sautéed on top.  The Lamb was very tender and accompanied by lovely sautéed vegetables, but it was not too rich, which is preferred at times. Another keynote about the Lamb Tagine is that was more hearty and less soupy.  Finally I loved this Harrisa and it was quite spicy but I loved it. I recommend using it sparingly. 

I definitely will be back to try a chicken dish next."}
{"text":"So my much awaited visit to Ajbani happpened this weekend. I was not impressed.  I really wanted them to be better than the other moroccan restaurant.I had two different dishes. The spicy lamb and the berber chicken. Neither one was seasoned as expected.  I have eaten a lot of Moroccan food (some of my best friends are Moroccan), this just didn't cut it. Cousous has never, in my experiences, been a side dish. Couscous is more than half of the dish! Not at Ajbani. Couscous is cheaper than rice so I was shocked at the measly amount they gave me. I'm being generous if it was 3/4 of a cup. I guess in terms of the small amount of meat they give you, it just may be proportioned. At $10.50-11.50 (+$2.00 for a little side of couscous and I mean, a little) I expected more than lunch portions. Not sure why they decided on the take-out theme. People want to sit down and experience this. Not take out like pizza...The seating area is small enough for 8 to sit comfortably. Parking is challenging on the weekends.  

My biggest issue- I think ethnic restaurants tend to lessen the amount of seasoning to please the demographics, but this is a fail.  Please allow people the pleasure of learning about your culture, the beauty and aromatic flavors of Morocco. Take a look at other Mediterranean restaurants an gauge your portions. That's how you will thrive. Good luck!"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! Was just wowed by the selections and how flavorful the food was. Fresh ingredients and an amazing aroma throughout the restaurant. Ive been here a few times and each time my experience is great. Warm and friendly staff. The owner is such a nice guy and is always very helpful in describing each dish and making recommendations. Many vegan and gluten free options. My favorite is the hummus and the baklava!! Yummm"}
{"text":"Delicious.   Everything we had was THAT good.  Don't pass up the tomato and caper salad with preserved lemon or the Harissa yogurt!"}
{"text":"The food was so delicious and the owner/manager was not only super friendly...he also seemed to delight in giving us translations for some of the names and answering our questions. What a great experience...we'll be back often! The only problem I foresee is Ajbani outgrowing this tiny space!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough!  Stumbled across this place when the restaurant we meant to go to was closed.  It was opening night on this small, mainly take out find.  Opening the door a wave of spice and aroma greeted us.  Chef Craig and his crew educated us about all the dishes and let us sample the most intriguing.  

It was a hard choice but we finally settled on the apricot rubbed chicken, the Kefta and the braised beef with hearty veggies. Many dishes are served with the most flavorful couscous I've had. 

Stop by and pick up your choice of this amazing food."}
{"text":"Wow this place is awesome! I had braised lamb and my sister had the Berber chicken. The couscous was perfectly cooked and delicious.  The meat was tender and we absolutely inhaled it all. Definitely get the mint tea, it is hot which I don't usually like but it was soooo good.  Best thing I have drank in a long time. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Driving through Charlotte and ran across this awesome place. From the outside it didn't look that great, however I trusted the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try. The food was surprisingly good! The hummus dish was very nice and refreshing. It was a large portion. Also had the chicken wrap with cucumbers and carrots. I think that was my favorite. Very flavorful yet not overwhelming. The chicken and fries Jagine was good but I thought it needed some salt to pull out the flavors a bit more.  Too full for dessert so we left with the chocolate and tahini truffle."}
{"text":"Excellent alternative for Vegetarians and Vegans in Charlotte

http://doinglean.blogspot.com/2015/09/ajbani-moroccan-cuisine-review.html"}
{"text":"Great choice for a delicious and convenient carry out meal! I ordered and paid ahead through my Yelp! App and my food was ready to go and packed up nicely when I arrived. We tried the Berber chicken- the cous cous was wonderful and the veggies and sauce were as well, the chicken was tender though not a huge portion of chicken as I had imagined from other reviews. We also had the falafel hummus wrap which was different from others I've had but really delicious, I would go back and grab that for lunch for sure! We also tried the fried vegetation filled pastries from the appetizer menu, the sauce was good and the texture amazing but the taste of being fried was quite strong and detracted from some of the other flavors. Overall, a great meal and we will be back for carry out on busy nights!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend and had the Chicken Berber and the Kefta Tajine. HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"This is a take-out spot that is open for only a few hours per day. I wish them well in this location. We have enough generic Tex-Mex and Asian places, and Abjani provides a fine alternative. First, the stand out item was the Harissa. I have requested it be made by hand before and this is the real deal. I would not consider an order from them without it. Next, the Falafel and Hummus Platter had quite thick hummus, actually so dense that it was difficult to dip. The falafel were excellent. The pita were dry and tough. My thought is to take them after warming and wrap in aluminum foil instead of pushing them into the wells of the plastic take-out tray.

The Carrot and Cucumber Salad was another hit. It's got the carrots, the cucumbers, and the golden raisins. Then, everyone wonders about that \"certain something.\" I believe it is orange water with the ginger that creates that North African sensation.

The Spicy Lamb was ordered \"Moroccan Spicy\" but was not even close. It would seem that dishes are not finished to order but dipped from a pot. The small lamb pieces were tasty and the Harissa made everything better. It would be better if the potato pieces were closer to the size of the lamb pieces. My Berber Chicken contained very little chicken and the vegetables were completely overcooked and mushy. Couscous was done well and had a good taste by itself. Recommendation: more chicken (increase price if necessary) and watch the overcooked vegetables.

The complimentary chocolate truffle was great fun. The texture of the truffle was good but the outer coating was very, very crunchy and reminded me of broken glass. I'd order them again, though, for the terrific taste."}
{"text":"It makes me sad to not give this place a higher review, but this is an honest one.

My fiance and I went there last night (a Sunday around 5:30 pm) and we were very excited when we realized that it is a predominately to-go restaurant, since that meant our food should be ready really quickly. (A very strong majority of the food on the menu is slow cooked and ready to ladle into the to go tins when you walk in.) Unfortunately, that was not the case. There were a few people in front of us who got food to eat there, but ours was just a few things to go. It took 40 minutes for the two guys to finally scoop our cous cous, ladel in our dishes, and give them to us. The only thing that had to be cooked in what we ordered was the falafel, which fries up in a quick 5-10 minutes max.  

My spicy lamb was not spicy, and the pita they gave us was bone hard to the point where it was almost inedible. There were some other things that were pretty good, such as the tomato and pepper sauce that they put on the hummus, but they were fewer and further between. Also, the carrot and cucumber salad was 95% shredded carrot, with only a few tiny slivers of cucumber. (Which they charged $4.50 for!)

I really wanted this place to be amazing, and maybe we just hit it on a bad day, but we were really not impressed. The quality of the food would have given it a 4 star rating, but the slowness of service, combined with the stale pita and slightly overpriced sides and appetizers, knocked it down to a 3-star."}
{"text":"Authentic savory northern African goodness. While visiting Charlotte I decided to find \"authentic\" Moroccan food. And I came across Ajbani!!!! The falafels are soooooo good! I mean insanely delicious.  And made from scratch.  The hummus is also my fav along with those crazy delicious tahini truffles.  But wait- the baklava is the absolute BEST!!! All made in house from scratch.  No pre-made frozen or canned food here. When you taste each ingredient on your tongue you can tell everything was made fresh and with lots of love.  The customer service is great. And it's definitely a place to grab and go! Best take-out ever! Oh, it's plenty of vegan and gluten free options! Yayyy   So if you're passing thru Charlotte stop by- I sure will make another stop on my road trip back to Atlanta.  Can't wait!  Bye, gotta go... I'm literally on my way back to Ajbani for more falafels and baklava!!!"}
{"text":"My first official moroccan!!

Got take out from here this weekend. We ordered two dishes and had a group so pretty good value. Now this rating was hard to exude because one dish was outstanding!! The other was bland and boring beyond words. I ordered the lamb meatballs tangene and the boy got apricot chicken. 

The meatballs were seriously phenomenal!!! The chicken was bland, barely any chicken or veggies and in a sea of couscous that wasn't very flavorful either. I'm still giving this place a four because I literally put the meatball in my mouth and declared it the best thing iv eaten this year! I'm gunna assume with this place anything to do with lamb is going to be more flavorful then anything with chicken.  And mayyybe the chicken dish was just off that day. Would def go back just not for chicken."}
{"text":"Ajbani.

Moroccan food has landed in Charlotte and it's delicious. There's plenty of Couscous for everyone. If you've never tried food from Northern Africa, you're in for a treat!

Go with a group of friends, like we did, so you can try a bunch of items!

Berber Chicken: roasted chicken with saffron, cinnamon and garlic over couscous.

Falafel Sandwich: actually - tender and smaller pieces - not dry at all.

Apricot Chicken: great flavor. Dry rubbed chicken served with olives, apricots and veggies. Yes, your chicken was better than mine! Don't rub it in.

7 Veggies with Lentils: really nicely balanced vegetable stew with the perfect amount of heat.

Keftah Brochettes: Moroccan BBQ style meatball kebabs - a nice meaty char served with Harissa yogurt sauce.

Veggie Briouats: little savory Phyllo pies - you won't miss the meat!

Tomato and Caper Salad: super summer dish made with a hint of preserved lemon.

Eggplant Zaalouk: roasted eggplant dip with garlic and tomato.

 The owner is very friendly and stays on top of quality control, making sure he's happy with the dishes and their appearance.

There are a few tables indoors and out, but you know how that goes in Charlotte. Either  face the brutal heat outdoors, or the hot air wafting over from the kitchen prep area. Take out is probably your best bet during the summer!"}
{"text":"I will be honest I think I expected a little too much. I used to work at a restaurant in Ohio where the main chef was from Morocco and had some Moroccan dishes on the menu. This place was very different from the type I am used to. Be forewarned it's quick counter service which we had not expected.

We had the spicy lamb and Berber chicken and baklava. It's not that the food was bad or anything but I think the only thing I would get again is the baklava.  Also it was ungodly hot in the place which meant we couldn't eat there comfortably. 

The somewhat nice thing is everything is already made and it had the feel of a subway line so it is quick. The guys there were pretty great, we had checked in on Yelp to try the free chocolate truffle but they were out, so they gave us a baklava instead. I am glad they did because I really liked it. They make theirs with pecans which made me smile and they are pretty large too."}
{"text":"The service is friendly and fast. The food is flavorful and heathy and includes vegan options. The hummus is some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"My younger sister lives in Morocco and is constantly raving about the food. Of course, that means I was super excited to find this place. My older sister and I did takeout from here and I get where my younger sister is coming from now. 

We ordered the hummus platter, lamb tajine, eggplant tajine, meatball tajine, and veggie cous cous. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the eggplant. It wasn't cooked down enough for me, so it had slightly rubbery texture to it. Everything was very flavorful, including the eggplant, but I think my favorite was the meatball tajine. They also gave us some complementary chocolate tahini truffles which were good, but such a bold and rich flavor that half of one was more than enough. 

I really want to go back and dine in. By the time we picked up our food and made it back home, everything was luke warm. Not the restaurant's fault but I can imagine everything tastes even better served hot. It's a very small place with a few tables so I think takeout is easier (and I could always heat it up at home if I needed to). 

The prices are beyond reasonable and the service was very friendly. If this place has piqued your interest, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"we ordered the lunch special with berber chicken and veggie with chickpeas. Both dishes were pretty bland. Not much chicken or chickpeas. Just a lot of couscous. The carrot salad wasn't good either. Maybe the other dishes are better but we were disappointed."}
{"text":"FYI's
-There are 3 small tables inside and 2 small tables outside. It is designed for take out. If you dine in, you will eat out of take out containers and plastic silverware. I am not a fan of this due to the high amount of waste it causes. 
-There is no alcohol. 
-Cute interior, open kitchen & usually 1 person working that cashes you out and cooks your food. (He changes his gloves between the two.)
-It's right next to Three Amigos on Central Ave. 
-The homemade Harissa hot sauce is hot af. The tiniest bit lit up my mouth and I have a high tolerance. 
-The hummus was delicious. My favorite part of the meal.  
I will be returning to try out the falafel!"}
{"text":"Berber chicken was unreal good. The lamb rolls were very good too, but for two people I'd go double Berber chicken. Girl working was accommodating and very nice and friendly. Will be back and will also spread the word. Can't wait to meet the owner. Quality establishment all around."}
{"text":"I love this place! I travelled to Morocco twice and fell in love with the country. This restaurant brings back so many great memories of those trips -- the sights, the sounds, the people and most importantly the flavors. I've tried a few dishes now. My favorite is probably the Tagine, in particular the Lamb Tagine. The Berber Chicken is also very good. 

Even though the entrees alone are too much food for one person (a good problem to have), don't overlook the appetizers, sides and deserts. The Briouats are great. The Harissa hot sauce is SO good with layer upon layer of flavor packed in one little cup. Annnnnd, I tried the Truffles tonight. Oh. My. Gosh. They are out of this world. Seriously. I'll never be able to order from Ajbani again without getting the Truffles. In fact, I may go back JUST for the Truffles. (A little dessert after dinner those nights we go to next door neighbor Three Amgios, maybe?) They are this perfect mix of sweet and savory, soft and crunch. Mmmm... 

I'll be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"Essentially just take out although there is some seating.  The falafel was really great and the lentils and couscous were pretty good too.  Lots of vegan options on the menu."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't wow either. The guys running it were kind. I got the falafel and hummus platter, couscous and truffles. The hummus was great, but the accompanying pitas were not tasty, at all. Landmark makes pita bread I'd lay my life down for so I may be bias here. The falafels were ok. Again, not wow but it's not like I've had a million falafels from every country in their native region; maybe that's how they make em in Morocco. The couscous was dry. Flat out bland and dry. And I don't think any accompanying entree with a sauce could fix that. Not cool. The truffles are indeed the star here. They could be an acquired taste kind of thing though... Sweet and then salty, with a nice crunch. Not overly rich but a powerful taste combo."}
{"text":"It's somewhere between a 4 and 5. Since I'm sleep deprived and all hopped up on coffee, we'll round up for good measure to a five.

I have been so excited to check this place out ever since I saw the reviews start popping up on Yelp. So when my fabulous, globe-trotting, six language speaking friend Dianne texted that she needed to be fed, I knew this was the perfect spot to bring her. 

A breakdown of our order:
Veggie Briouats- I'm not vegetarian, but we went with these as a suggestion from the guy who took our order. He was right, you won't miss the meat with this savory filling. This is an item I will definitely order every time.
Kefta Brochettes- delicious meatball-like kabobs. It comes with a harissa yogurt dipping sauce. 
Rubbed chicken and apricot- this was Dianne's entree. I loved the flavors of this. Definitely a big enough portion to share or divide up to make two meals. 
Kama veggie tajine- I had my heart set on the hearty veggie with chickpeas, but they were in the process of cooking a new batch and I was too hungry to wait. So, I went this route and ordered it over couscous. This is such a filling dish. I was stuffed less than half way through and enjoyed the leftovers the next day for lunch. I will be back to get the veggie and chickpeas!

The couscous is really good by itself. They slow cook large batches daily. It has a a great flavor. Make sure you try it on its own before mixing with your entree. I know my Twitter friend Katie L. is obsessed with the falafel here. I haven't had a chance to try it yet. If you're not sure what to order, don't be afraid to ask questions. They are happy to help. As we were leaving, the guy ran outside to track us down because he found a keychain on the floor and thought we had left it. Super nice. 

Ajbani is located in the old Second Helping spot next to Three Amigos. It is primarily a take-out place, but they do have a few small tables inside and out. They also have a cooler with some beverages (water, Honest Tea). 

Kudos to the crew here for bringing an underrepresented cuisine to the Queen City. This is such a great addition to Plaza Midwood and Charlotte."}
{"text":"A great new addition to this part of town.  Food was very good, and is designed for take out. We opted to eat in and my only critique would be to have serve ware designed for eating in, even if it is disposable! Make sure to try the mint tea!"}
{"text":"It has CLOSED - Here is a notice from Ajbani's  webpage:

Important Announcement: 
Ajbani Moroccan Cuisine has officially closed its Plaza Midwood location. We are in the process of searching for a new location where we can continue to serve amazing Moroccan cuisine in a full service and sit down restaurant. 
In the mean time, a new concept called \"Soul Central\" will open soon in Ajbani's location, serving comfort food with a Caribbean twist. Please welcome the new owners and show them some love and support.
We will keep you posted as we look for a new location, and we hope to see you again very soon.

Here's why my four stars:  Several months ago, I tried it, and the food and service were worth four stars.  The service was fast, and the food was fresh.  However, I only went there once because, for me, Moroccan dining is most enjoyable when experienced in its entirety with the exotic presentation (I am NOT talking about the belly dancing which I can take or leave).  I cannot downgrade Ajbani for serving its food in carry-out containers.  And, while I don't think they served basilla (that's a negative), I can't be sure.  

It is exciting that they are going to reopen in a place where they can offer a true, sit-down experience (maybe even with the handwashing and hot tea ceremonies).  I cannot wait!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE the food here! The service is good. The most amazing thing on the menu is the Kefta meatballs! They are totally to die for! We get those every time. Unfortunate they seem to run out of them...a lot. Which is pretty disappointing since those are the main reason we go."}
{"text":"I saw the good reviews and decided to place a to-go order. Food was pretty flavorful. I got the lamb briouats for appetizer, rubbed chicken & apricot couscous and spicy lamb for entrees, and the tahini and chocolate truffles for dessert.

Small store, not much sitting so I bet most customers get their food to-go. The staff were friendly and helpful, recommended their popular dishes since it's my first time.

I'd go back :)"}
{"text":"Not sure where the high ratings come from. We ordered 4 dishes for takeout and the dishes were average and could have used more seasoning. The spicy lamb tagine was tasty but not spicy, and the veggies were overcooked. The meatballs in the tagine were overcooked; the overall dish was fine but nothing I'd recommend. The soup, again, was okay but nothing special. By far the best dish was the chicken brochettes; well seasoned with a very spicy yogurt sauce. 

We were a little disappointed considering we love trying new foods. Maybe it's better if you dine in, or perhaps people were excited to try Moroccan. But with a tagine and a solid cookbook you can make better at home."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, reminds me of my mother cusine back in the country! I love it !"}
{"text":"LOVE that we got a Moroccan joint in the neighborhood, I mean let's be honest, in Charlotte in general. After finally making it to get take-out, since when I tried last time they were already closed at 9:15pm even though they say they close at 10pm, I can say that I'm either not that impressed with Moroccan food (I don't think that can be it) or I'm just not impressed with Ajbani's version of it. 

I got the lamb briouats, the Spicy Lamb Tajine, and the carrot salad. The briouats were the best thing that we ordered, crispy and flavorful. The carrot salad comes in second. It serves as a nice compliment to the rich and spicy foods. The tajine however I found to be horribly bland. The preserved lemon was a nice touch, but I think before they start thinking of garnish they need to stick to old faithful...SALT. I had to use a ton in order to taste any of the ingredients in this dish. I would ask if it were supposed to be so underseasoned except that the taste level of the briouats lets me know that they should know better. 

I will go back for the briouats and to give the entrees another chance. I mean was the spicy lamb just the wrong choice?!"}
{"text":"I've never had Morrocan food, so I have nothing to compare this to...but I enjoyed the food!

I had a Groupon, which enticed me to try something new. My family and I ordered carry-out and had enough food for a couple days. I ordered the Traditional Veggie & Chickpeas, my husband ordered Berber Chicken, and we also got the Eggplant dip. The veg dish was delicious and I adored the sultanas and dried apricots sprinkled throughout...topped with the spicy homemade Harrissa dip  made everything taste so friggin good! The eggplant dip was tasty as well, with a beautiful hint of cinnamon.

The gentleman at the counter was kind and generous, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came to this place because when I went to pick up food at the Mexican place next door, I was completely ignored. So, I walked into Ajbani, exhausted, hungry, and just wanted food. I explained to the guy that I just finished a long work week and it was my first day off with only 3 hours sleep. I told him my brain wasn't functioning, and I asked him what was good. He asked if I liked lamb and I said yes. So he recommended the spicy Lamb. I got a side of hummus. 

The lamb was super tender and kind of melted in my mouth. The flavor was on point! The lemon, the spice, the seasonings... delicious! The humus was also super delicious. The flavor was unlike any I've had in my hummus. It just had a super fresh taste to it. I'll be getting hummus from there again in the future for sure!

The only downsides: For $16 for takeout dinner, I expected more. The pita was hard and bordered on pita chips. It distracted from the flavor of the hummus. The lamb didn't come with even a small side of couscous. 

My first Moroccan experience was in Nice France, and for roughly the same price (and maybe a bit less even), the amount of food I got in France was a lot more... which is surprising b/c it was France. The meal came with a huge pot of couscous (for one person). It was too much food for one person. So to spend so much and not get that much was a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"Just wanted to add an update- went to Ajbani for the second time yesterday for lunch and was treated with even more warmth and kindness than the first time I arrived! We came before 3pm which meant we had access to the express lunch menu: 8.99 for any entree, as well a choice of side. I ordered the apricot chicken and soup and my friend ordered the Berber chicken. Both were served quickly, alongside our soup, and we enjoyed it inside the restaurant. About halfway through our meal, the owner came out and offered us a free serving of a delicious appetizer and a fresh serving of pita. I couldn't believe our luck and their generosity! I was impressed with all the food- and my friend who ordered Baklava said it was the best he had in years! I think that the lunch prices make this a much more reasonably priced menu, so consider going for lunch to try out this amazing gem of Charlotte. You will be treated well and leave happy!"}
{"text":"We are thrilled to have Ajbani in the neighborhood now! We have tried a number of dishes already and found them all to be very tasty. The falafel sandwich was fantastic. The spicy lamb tagine was excellent. The chicken wrap with the chermoula sauce was very nice. We look forward to trying everything on the menu eventually. Also, the chocolate tahini balls are absolutely delicious. Ajbani is a fantastic option that has been added to PM."}
{"text":"This was a tough rating to give because there was such disparity between the two dishes we ordered. The kefta meatballs were amazing...best meatballs I've had since my grandmother. On the other hand, the rubbed chicken and apricot dish was extremely bland."}
