{"text":"This business made an excellent choice with their food/drink photographer for their ads - that's what pulled me in. 

Got buy 1 get 1 free promo deal - after liking their facebook page, get 1 drink then get the original milk tea with tapioca for free. The inside is nice, clean and new with similar atmosphere as other bubble tea places such as Teashop 168 etc. The drink selection is not as lengthy but includes a good variety. 

I ordered green tea matcha slush with redbean  (~$6), as that was the featured item in their ad. The staff was friendly but my drink took a little too long. It seemed like the staff was still trying to get used to the set up (ie. remembering where things are), and this seemed to contribute to the hold up at the bar.

A little more red bean would have been good in the slush but overall it was fine. I liked that the slush wasn't too icy but rather remained smooth and flavourful till the last sip. Its consistency was thick like a green tea milkshake if there was such a thing.  

If they keep the same excellent photographer for their next promo, I have a feeling I would be pulled in again....."}
{"text":"Their original location is near Yonge and finch, and this is their first downtown location. I've come here a couple of times during my last year in Toronto and found their bubble tea to be delicious every time I've ordered. 
What I found disappointing was how they had fresh taro bubble tea on their menu but I was never able to order it because they didn't have fresh taro. I had this drink once at their original location and fell in love with it, so I was excited to try it in downtown, only to find that they're not offering it because they don't have any. I've visited numerous times over a few months to check whether they had fresh taro, and they never did. Why keep it on the menu when you aren't able to make it? I was getting angry at that point. 
Anyway, the bubble tea are quite good, especially their smoothies and the ones with ice cream in it. It's a good place to get a quick bubble tea fix or lounge with your friends with some board games. 
I hope they removed their fresh taro bubble tea off the menu now, if they still don't offer it."}
{"text":"This seems like any standard bubble tea shop downtown with standard offerings of simple meals and sweets. I didn't see anything to differentiate on their menu, and that's fine. Bubble tea & desserts are always welcome in my books, especially in the downtown core where late-night non-bar options are few and far between (though improving!).

However, opening weekend pains seem to be affecting this place. Of three orders, two were wrong, even when taking the time to point out and correct one item in question during the ordering process. The other drink came with un-asked for tapioca and we were still charged for it when we pointed this out to the wait-staff.

Given that there is so much competition for bubble tea in general and nothing to set this place apart, I'm not sure that I'd return after the less than stellar service and response. Their late-night hours are a lure, but HiTea should take the time to train and educate their staff so that their staff - their front-line - can effectively address issues that arise and be an effective ambassador for their brand. A less than grand opening, unfortunately.

After all the errors, I did chuckle when our waiter came by later to point out that we could like their Facebook page and get a free regular milk tea with tapioca."}
{"text":"The seating area is a little bit small but other than that they have a good variety of foods to choose from (meals, snacks and desserts). I've been there around 3-4 times and I like it so far."}
{"text":"My and my bf got the original bubble tea,and it was very watery and bad was really bad. We also ordered the black sesame waffles, while the black sesame ice cream was good, the waffles were very dry and tasted like frozen waffles that you can purchase at the grocery store. It is a nice place to talk and catch up with friends with a cup of brewed tea but definitely not the place to go for dessert."}
{"text":"The cashier was aggressive and the bubble tea was
Just so-so.Never be back,too pricing compared to the neighborhood like,beautea cafe or ten ren,or even probably worse than a waffle place's casual grab.Done.Never back."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Walked-in on a Saturday afternoon, no surprise it was busy, but we were able to be seated at the far corner. At this time, there were a group of 4-5 waiting for their orders to be taken. 

My friend and I took about 2 minutes looking at the menu, pining over some waffles when one of the staff told us she couldn't make waffles and crepes for us because it was busy.

My friend and I were disappointed as we were looking forward to the waffles. I asked the staff how long the wait was for the waffles and she gently said, \"there are a lot more people coming in, so I don't really know.\" Well, my friend and I sat there deciding whether we want to have milk tea or just leave. As we were deciding what we should do, the group that had been waiting for their orders had already left and the remaining customers had begun feasting on their waffles. Understood that those customers had arrived before us but the crowd had gone and there wasn't any lineup. The staff still couldn't make waffles and crepes. So we left.

Not impressed and not coming back."}
{"text":"HiTea is located just outside wellesley station, so going their was super easy for me and my cousin. We walked in on a wednesday afternoon (opens at 11:30) and the place slowly filled up with mainly students.

The waiter was extremley nice/polite to us, though our food took normal than longer waiting time. I ordered the chicken cutlet meal (8.99) a honey lemon ice tea (4.00) and we shared a herbal honey tea which came in a large pot (7.00). My cousin had a honeydew ice tea and ordered a salmon meal (8.99)

The food was really yummy and the drinks were super good/soothing on a cold winter day. Its interior  was super neat and was very spacious to accomodate large groups of people. 

HiTea is a good way to avoid the other overcrowded bubble tea shops downtown and their menu is quite diverse compared to others."}
{"text":"I wouldn't give 1 star. We ordered mixed fruit waffle with nuts since they didn't have crepe and what we got was very little fruit without strawberry and nuts and the vanilla icecream was changed to green tea icecream. OK.  Ice cream was good but he could have informed us before. What he said was there weren't enough fruits but then he put strawberries into other customers' waffle. How about the nuts! Can't you find any nuts in any stores?!?! Ridiculous! When we asked he didn't make any efforts to change it. At least he could have put more banana considering it's the cheapest fruit! No surprise he has bad reviews. To get some nice reviews he could have changed his serving attitude."}
{"text":"It was ok. I went for their 1.99 grapefruit green tea special. Toppings like tapioca isn't included but it's only 50 cents, and upgrade to large is 1 dollar. 

Made it a little less sweet and it has a tarty flavour, but doesn't have that refreshing \"zing\" I like grapefruit bbt to have.

I also didn't know it has no ice by default! So I took my tea to go and it's not super cold lol. Tapioca is on the slightly softer side (but not like, amateur bubble tea shop level of terrible softness) and it doesn't have a nice sweet exterior (or much flavour).   

The shop itself is big and clean though with awesome mando pop music playing softly, and the guy making the drink was pretty nice. There are also games provided so it seems very chill for hanging out. I might go if I'm nearby again because I don't think the nearby bbt shops had any specials. But if I was in a splurging mood I might skip this one. For a hangout place though it'd be A+."}
{"text":"I liked sitting there drinking green milk bubble tea and flipping through Korean magazines. That was a good way to kill time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Oooookay, I should have read the reviews before coming here and this was a BIIIIG mistake.

First of all, display and everything REALLY makes you think this place is great and all, but don't let the false advertisement fool you.

They show their drinks and desserts and what not, so it would be safe to THINK they had all that to offer. What do I get told for dessert selection? They ONLY have maccha ice cream and ONLY waffles being served at the time...Are you serious? What kind of bbt place is this? No re-stocking I suppose? Not to mention no fair warning on their menus or having a sign stating their lack of options? So you want to reel in the customers psyching them out when they ask for something you don't have...great...fine, you lost that one buddy, I ain't having anything else but perhaps the drinks will save you as they look decent...

Now we all know what mint chocolate ice cream tastes like right? I've had it enough times at Baskin Robbins and other ice cream places so I'm well AWARE how mint chocolate tastes like. Let me tell you, my bubble tea tasted NO WHERE close to that (I chose the Mint Chocolate Milk Tea). It was watered down, AND I MEAN WATERED DOWN, chocolate milk...hell it tasted like 1/4 chocolate milk mixed with 3/4 water! No sign of the mint! Bland and tasteless!

To conclude, I will never return. End of story. There are a ton of other better bbt places than this one. No reason to waste more time here."}
{"text":"Hi Tea is pretty overpriced for a lot of the teas that they offer. Their teas are not really their strong point, and the quality of the boba and condiments is not all that great either. I've ordered their food and it was pretty bland and ordinary. I think their desserts are pretty good such as the waffles and ice cream, but truthfully said, who can mess up waffles and ice cream. (you could go somewhere else that actually specializes in waffles and ice cream)

They give you a stamp for each drink you order, but you have to collect ten stamps to get one regular sized drink with no condiments at all. This is not really a great incentive to come here, but they do have a few poker cards and since it's pretty empty most of the time you could come here to chill a few hours with your friends."}
{"text":"Pros: spacious seating area and pretty accommodating staff

Cons: tapioca isn't good here, and there's a decent chance they'll mess up your order

We came as a group of 7. I ordered the taro coconut green tea, large size, hot, no tapioca, and 25% sugar. What they gave me was cold and with tapioca. They also mixed up two other orders in terms of hot/cold.

Besides that, my taro coconut was actually very tasty! Which is why I'm giving this place 3 stars. Otherwise, it would probably be 2. The tapioca here wasn't good at all. It wasn't chewy. Instead, the outside tasted soggy and the inside was hard and undercooked."}
{"text":"Had their beef noodle. Priced at $7.99 that comes with a Green Tea Ice Tea. 

Seeing how this was suppose to be a \"taiwanese\" style food you would expect the noodle to be similar to the beef noodle you have elsewhere. But instead it was just a pack of udon. The soup base was also very acidic as they had loaded it up with a lot of vinegar. The beef it was soft but there was no taste to it. Also you get 3 small pieces. 

The tea was also blend. With bits of tea leaves as well. 

Dude at the counter was also very clueless. And did not seem like he wanted to help cause he was surprised that anyone even wanted to go into the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the worst bbt / Taiwanese places I've been to. I got their curry fish balls and what I got was a few sad little balls with thick \"curry\" sauce slapped on top. Tasted hard and rubbery and I had to throw it away. 

The bubble tea is OK, below average at best but why come here when chatime is around the corner."}
{"text":"I would of given a 5 star if the price of their drinks are a little cheaper. 
But this is my favourite bubble tea place downtown because their drinks are just that good. Every time I buy drinks for a friend, they are always surprised at just how good the drinks are."}
{"text":"I will not be returning here.  I've been here more than enough to get two free reward cards for a free tea and I had a ridiculous experience the last 3-4 visits.  

1. They have been cheaping out on the teas where it's only 75% full because it's all foam at the top.

2. They are supposed to give you two stamps for large drinks but tried to get away by giving only one

3. When I wanted to pay for my regular drink with the free reward card, they told me I had to pay extra because I had a flavour (grapefruit green tea) apparently, the free drink is only if you get plain green or black tea (this seemed odd because the first time I got it, it was free regular any tea with topping or large without topping). So essentially, they are cheaping out for a couple of cents and now losing a customer.

It's just too bad this is how they are running a business; why bother having a loyalty program to piss off loyal customer?"}
{"text":"Mediocre place really there is better bubble teas out there !!! The menus are quite extensive and good to have why the lower rating ? Well this visit they ran out of tapioca how can you run out of tapioca when that's the best seller? Well went ahead and ordered the passion fruit green tea well one word its too sweet I like how they put some seeds of the fruit in the drink but that's all. The layout and decor of this place is nice the seating area is very small tho they can seat about 12-20 people max. They do let and provide games as I know lots of bbt places do not encourage games and allow seating hour limit 2 hours. I like how theres an outlet plug at every station and free WiFi you need to ask for the password tho. The food was OK a bit overpriced tho."}
{"text":"This location is right by Wellsey station and after a night out with friends, before going home, we decided to stop by here. I didn't check the reviews of this place beforehand, but I probably should have. The interior wasn't exactly super pretty, but it seemed like one of those restaurants that have so few customer, kind of factory lookin with nice furniture.

We had eight people at a table and they messed up 5/8 of our orders. The servers were really nice and were quick with our orders but maybe too quick. I ordered the Rose milk tea with tapioca and expected a cold drink but I received a hot drink that was a large size (?), while everyone else had a regular size. Tapioca + hot tea = gross plastic tasting soggy boba. I basically paid for a drink I didn't enjoy but I also didn't want to go through the trouble with re-ordering. They have board games as well. 

Sorry, I wouldn't come back here! I'd rather go to share tea right across the street."}
{"text":"The place was super dead during our whole lunch on a Thursday from around 12:30 to 1:30pm something.  The atmosphere was strange when there were only my colleague and myself there.  The service was nothing intimate.  I was thinking to try their Taiwanese beef noodles but the service staff told me this was sold out.  Then she kept on telling us there were more sold out at least another two to three items.  Since my colleague recommended this place, I would give it a try no matter what.

We finally ordered a 3-item appetizer (curry fish balls, popcorn chickens and deep fried squid balls).  They were pretty ok.  We both ordered the Taiwanese minced pork rice lunch set (came with a soup and a fruity iced tea of our preferred flavor).  It was of good value and portion for only $6.99 each set.  Food and the iced tea tasted good.

I didn't get a chance to try their bubble tea dessert.  My colleague said it was good.  I guess the place might be more busy later in the afternoon, at night or during weekends."}
{"text":"This a little hole in the wall shop but it's well worth stopping in! The staff is kind and environment is laid back and there's a bar for you sit and enjoy your tea. All.of thier ingredients are fresh and it's made right in front of you. Because of the fresh ingredients,  the drinks cam be on the warm side so I would recommend you ask them for ice. Their teas were definitely refreshing on a hot summer day!"}
{"text":"Bubble Teas in downtown Toronto are very popular, on every other block you will find a Bubble Tea place. This is one of the best I have found.
They know what they do, how to make a good Bubble Tea.
You can choose either black or green tea, with or without milk (milk powder).
My favorites have always been Honeydew Green Tea (both with or without milk), Green Apple Green Tea and Plum Tea.
I have also tried but wasn't a big fan of Taro Bubble Tea and Almond Milk Tea (black tea). I have never been the fan of actual tapioca balls, so I order without.
You have to let them know if you want tapioca in your tea.
But they have all kinds of tapioca and jelly. Everyone else seem to love it.
Love the fact that you can select either you want 100%, 75% or 50% sweet. It comes 100% sugar but I think 75% sugar is sweet enough.
The cons:
- They charge $0.50 more if you pay by credit card.
- The prices are pretty high. $5 for a tea is too much.
They also sell Asian dishes that unfortunately I haven't tried. So this review is for teas only."}
{"text":"Came in at 9pm on a Saturday night and they ran out of tapioca. Nooo!!! And for aloe vera it's an additional $0.75? No thank you! It should be the same cost as tapioca. I do like that they had an electrical outlet at every table so you can charge your phone and laptop and use their free wifi. We ordered the popcorn chicken and fried chicken cutlet with rice which both chicken dishes tasted the same. They were lightly fried and tender. We also ordered a winter melon green tea and milk tea which you can customize with the amount of ice and sugar you'd like, which a lot of bubble tea shops are doing right now. It's a cool hang out area, and nicely located in downtown Toronto and close to Wellsley subway station. I would definitely come back. Hopefully they won't run out of tapioca this time."}
{"text":"Amazing dessert shop combined with a bubble tea menu, what more could you want? This place is great, with ample seating, friendly and capable staff, with HUGE drink and snack menu. If you play your cards right, this is a good backup if your reservation elsewhere fell through. 

The only issue is that there are times when tasty treats are completely sold out or unavailable. I don't know if it's a marketing stunt, or they genuinely aren't stocked, but I will definitely be going again.

Recommendations:
-Bubble Tea
-Rice Pudding
-Waffle Snacks"}
{"text":"Good location with great snacks and drinks! 
It's a bit too expensive though 

Also they don't take credit cards"}
{"text":"I really hate giving bad reviews, but boy, has this place gone down the drain. 

Where do I start? 
Despite not being fully at capacity, it literally took 50 minutes for them to serve what seemed like a pre-packaged, overcooked meal. 

Upon waiting 30 minutes, we cordially asked the server how much longer it was going to take. They replied \"5 minutes\". Another 10 minutes went by and the food was still not there. Already late for our other engagement, we asked whether we could just pay for our tea and leave. 
This then devolved into the server launching into a tirade about how we didn't actually wait that long and we couldn't just leave after ordering food. 

My friend left the place and I stayed until the food came a few minutes later. 
The food was so bland and tasteless. I could have been eating plastic for all I know. 

This whole episode left me feeling extremely upset. I have a strong allegiance to Taiwanese food and its really disappointing that my favorite cuisine could be served so badly. 

Worst service I have ever had in Toronto, no exaggeration."}
{"text":"First experience was a disappointment. I ordered the pork cutlet meal and it didn't match the picture that was in the menu. The pork cutlet was literally a pork chop with the bone still in. breaded in a batter rather than panko or breadcrumbs. It was only cut half way through so eating with only a spoon and chopsticks was- as you can imagine - quite difficult. They should have given me a fork and a knife. The rice that came with the meal had the consistency of rice that had cooled and been reheated in the microwave. 

I also ordered the Oreo milk bubble tea. Again, false advertisement. The image in the menu gave the impression that the drink would come with an actually oreo cookie, or at least a generic kind but alas, no. My drink also didn't have any tapioca in it. Was I suppose to specify that I wanted them? At the least the waitress should have asked me my preference. My friend also received the wrong order, but at least they didn't charge her for it.

Overall the meal was mediocre. You can get better elsewhere. I have yet to try their desserts, hopefully they're better."}
{"text":"Really like this place! The flavours are typical for a bubble tea shop but their menu caters to more of a cafe scene with waffles, food and cakes. I feel like chatime is a huge trend and not much different from hitea. prices are similar too. Oh, hitea has white Tapioca, very good and pretty awesome looking in your bbt!"}
