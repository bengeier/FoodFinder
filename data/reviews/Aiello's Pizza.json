{"text":"It's total BS that they advertise beer on the sign outside and have huge beer coolers inside (with prices listed!) but don't sell beer.  To my mind, that's a bait and switch to lure customers inside. If that's how they operate, that suggests they can't be trusted."}
{"text":"This was the first pizza I ate in the 'burgh after living in NY for a number of years.  One of the other reviewers is correct in that the sauce is sweeter than a NY style pie.  However, despite noting the sweetness my wife and I made pigs of ourselves!  We loved the melty and yet bubbly and just perfectly browned cheese. I liked the smaller cuts--though it led to eating too many slices.   This place was definitely worth it and about the same price as we're used to from NY. We ate plain cheese though so maybe that explains it.  I would say the pizza tastes different from what we make for ourselves, but we will definitely have it again.  I wouldn't recommend eating in the store since it's really hot from all the pizza ovens. We got our pizza to go, and it was hot enough that we didn't have to microwave it after a 10 min walk home."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a wedding and we were hungry the night after the wedding. Since we were full of booze, pizza sounded great. 6 of us ended up here around 830 or 9pm on sunday night after someone recommended it to us. The pizza was very tasty but for some reason the guy who took our order was an ass. He had a terrible attitude and was very rude to us. Maybe because it was late on sunday or maybe because we are from NY...  i dont know, but you are an ass buddy. You make good pizza but you're still an ass. And the guy who worked in the back seemed to have chip on his shoulder as well. Pizza gets 4 but the employees get 1."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza and service. The more you eat, the more you want. Dominic gives great beer suggestions too. Relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Canned mushrooms! $30 for one pizza and some breadsticks. Nothing to write home about at ALL!  Did I mention they use canned mushrooms?! They might as well slice a rubber bouncy ball on the pizza.  Those might taste better and be less chewy than canned mushrooms."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite pizza places ever, and I've eaten lots of pizza in my 24 years here on Earth! Every time we go through Sq. Hill or even past it I have to get some Aiello's pizza. Everyone that works there has been super nice when we call / pick it up the pizza is amazing! It's got just the perfect amount of cheese and sauce on it       ( not too much for me)."}
{"text":"Great pizza shop environment.  The inside looks exactly like a classic pizza shop.  I really like that I can just take a drink out of the cooler myself it feels less informal.  As far as the pizza goes....  BEST PIZZA EVER  My favorite pizza by far.  There's not much else to say about the actual pizza besides it's great and you need to try it.    You should know that they don't take cards and parking can sometimes be a hassle.  Also I would recommend ordering before hand so you don't die of hunger once you see how good the pizza looks"}
{"text":"The pizza is among the best in Pittsburgh but it is very inconsistent. If one of the owners is working the pizza is amazing and is easily a 5 but if they are not the quality drops significantly. It makes me want to call and ask who is working before placing an order because the experience can drastically differ. I can't give less then a 4 because I have walked out with amazing pizza but unfortunately it doesn't happen every time."}
{"text":"Really one of the best pizza places I've ever been to.  Lots of options, you see your food made for you, and (most importantly) it really just tastes great.  A second thing that really impressed me is that every single guy behind the counter looked delighted to be there, at least during my visit.  It was almost creepy how happy they were just making pizza, but I'm not complaining.  To be fair, the dining area could stand to look better.  But I'm just judging based on food quality and atmosphere, which were excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to embroil myself in the debate as to the best pizza in Pittsburgh or the world. I'm not going to compare it to the pizza I had in X city that supposedly has some authority to proclaim itself authentic. I'll merely say that I tried Aiello's last night for the first time and I was impressed. The sauce was good, the crust was just the right balance of crisp, yet pliable, and the toppings didn't feel like they were slopped on from a can (onion with half black olive and the other half pineapple). It also didn't feel particularly greasy. All around solid pizza.   I also liked that when I called and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes, that it was. I walked in and 3 minutes later they pulled it out of the oven and I was on my way. I also liked that the place was bright and super clean. You just get the feeling that they are professionals who love what they do.   I don't know if it is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh, but it's definitely vying for the crown."}
{"text":"The service was terrible.  I ordered a Margherita Pizza for 3 people and was told that you would pay after eating.   The pizza was not bad, but when the check came the pizza was $30!  This was  I think a 12 slice pizza.  Totally overpriced.  The menu is very hard to read and so you have no idea how much anything will cost until you already eat it.  OVERPRICED!  I live nearby and will be taking my business to the many other pizza shops in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. Don't know why exactly, everything just comes together perfectly at this place. 6 stars."}
{"text":"I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.    One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.  The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites: Fiori's Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch) Pizza Perfectta Aiello's (Murray Street) Beto's  Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.  \"Cuts\" (Pittsburgh speak for \"slices\") are small but they are also priced a little cheaper than the average pizza place.  There's seating in the back if you're not taking out."}
{"text":"This is some good pizza. Cheese, sauce, toppings, etc. I find I like this better than Mineo's-- gasp! Sacrilege! Aiello's is inferior! Mineo's is Pittsburgh's Best! Yeah, yeah. I think Mineo's crust is harder than Aiello's both times I've tried it. I also don't like onions being added AFTER the pizza is cooked so that my breath smells like a hot funky mess after eating it. So this is why I'm choosing Aiello's. According to sources, there are more pizza joints in the 'burgh than anywhere in the nation with 1,000+. My review could change upon trying more of them."}
{"text":"Nice bubbly toasted crust with good flavor - the staff was very friendly, and the sutffed (sausage and pepperoni?) slice was fantastic, but the margherita pizza was the star."}
{"text":"This IS the best pizza restaurant in the 'burgh. Period. End of story.  All you Mineo's fanboys can cry me a river with your, \"they use a potato flour crust\".  Aiello's uses a sweeter sauce which really sets this place apart, and in retrospect, is probably why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town so far. Been here 12 years. Friendly staff. Definitely enjoy pizza by the slice better than the whole pie. My whole family loves this place. Three kids and wife taste tested a few times with competitors on the street. Aiello's always won. Took a little bit to adjust to this style of pizza, but now we all crave it. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the world outside of Italy.  I grew up with Aiello's and there's nothing quite like it.  Whenever I'm home I make a stop at Aiello's before I leave.  You aren't there for the ambiance and the staff.  Make sure to Youtube the prank call to Aiello's from the Howard Stern show - hilarious."}
{"text":"I ordered a large 16 cut one topping and must say I wasn't impressed. For $18.75 the cheese was sort of burnt, and there was hardly any mushrooms on the pizza. (Crust was good) To top it off I've had stomach pains all evening and this morning from it"}
{"text":"We are born and raised Yinzers. We have had this several times before but not for years. We don't venture to Squirrel Hill too often anymore.  We were in the area and thought we'd do takeout since it's been a while. We could not get past the sauce. It was cranberry in color and super salty to taste. I mean I ended up scraping off the sauce to eat it. The crust is awesome, the cheese is good, the sauce ruined it. I don't know if it was an off night, but we will not return."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, the sauce is slightly peppery for my taste, but not bad if you're looking for pizza in Sq.Hill. The people working there always seem to be nice, and the pizza itself will defiantly fill you up. It's nothing I would say I absolutely crave, but it's not bad. Better than delivery pizza, not as good as others."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Thin crust lot's of good cheese"}
{"text":"Yum! I've bee living in CA a loooong time and they just don't know how to make good pizza out there! So nice to come home for a visit and get some. Takes me back to when I was a kid. Hubby had a cheesesteak that was awesome too! They said they would ship pizza to me in CA. It's a nice thought, but I'm pretty sure I don't have that kind of $$$!"}
{"text":"Delicious and quick. Mineo's is good - Aiello's is better. Staff was super friendly and helpful too."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh. Definitely worth the price. You get what you pay for! Always bring out of town friends here."}
{"text":"I like Aiello's but the last time I went, I found it pretty pricey and wound up being sorry I went out of my way for it.  Close to $40 for two pies and some drinks.  Seems excessive.  Also as has been noted, you certainly don't get service with a smile and they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"No doubt about it, the history of this establishment is inspirational. That being said, I doubt I will be going back there very soon. I am not a pizza snob by any means, and have eaten everything from frozen pizza, airport pizza, fast food pizza, and genuine Italian pizza, but this pizza just fell off target. I got just a slice of the plain cheese pizza and could tell that the cheese was definitely fresh and the dough homemade. However, the sauce was overly sweet, the dough was a bit tough, and overall it was a rather bland piece of pizza. It fell somewhere between Italian pizza and American pizza, but sadly failed to be either."}
{"text":"I'm usually a Mineo's guy but decided to give this a shot last weekend.  It's been a few years since I have had Aiello's and I was looking for something different.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the pizza.  Good crisp crust, lots of cheese and the sauce wasn't as sweet as I remember from prior visits.  Will be added to the list for future visits."}
{"text":"Best slices in town period. Better with fresh cheese and garlic. My mouth waters every time I get a perfect large pie from these guys. Call ahead  10-15 mins in advance for the best pies in Pittsburgh. There is no other pepperoni roll in the WORLD I would get than this place."}
{"text":"Aiello's does a truly great white pizza: one of the best I've ever had.  I can also recommend Aiello's strombolis and margherita pizza.   In general, their flavor profile tends toward the nutty satisfaction of parmesan and roasted garlic.   It's winter pizza, good for warming your belly for a walk home in the snow.  Mineo's down the street is more summer pizza, thinner crust and more of an emphasis on sauce that gives you a jolt of energy on warm twilit evenings.   Aiello's is open fairly late and their pizza reheats well, so it's ideal for those of us who often find our way there after a long day's work.  In house slices are cheap, though getting a fresh pie for a party can get pricy."}
{"text":"Way better than Mineos.  A slicer of Pepperoni & a slice of Margherita and you're good to go.  Crust is wonderful.  Sauce is a little on the sweet side, but I can overlook that."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a Pirates game and had to stop in at Aiello's Pizza once again for my favorite pizza. Oh man, Aiello's is the best of the best.   We wasn't able to eat at Aiello's the last time because there was no place to park, so this time we had pizza for breakfast. It was a rainy day and plenty of street parking. We had the white pizza again and I could have ate my weight in it."}
{"text":"Aiello's vs. Mineo's is a timeless debate, and to be honest I was always a Mineo's broad.  But today I said, \"let's do this,\" and I went to the other side and holy hell was it good.  There's a good amount of sauce, not too much cheese (yes there is such a thing, crazy I know), and a crust that is thin and crispy but flavorful.  Their pizza is slightly salty in a good way and the sauce is savory with a slight sweetness that compliments the salty cheese well.  It's worth the extra mile or so and few extra bucks for this pizza than from my regular neighborhood joint.  Another plus is there's outdoor seating, nothing fancy but on a beautiful night it's nice to not eat at home or in an oven of a pizza galley.  I don't like their stuffed pizza, I think it's gross and too greasy and salty."}
{"text":"No doubt about it the pizza is awesome. However you do pay for what you get so expect to pay a few more bucks for on of their pies but I'm telling you that it is truly worth it."}
{"text":"I've grown up eating pizza here. It used to be a institution. Now it's garbage. The workers are rude, the pizza was unrecognizable. Sad to see them fall off so badly."}
{"text":"I hate that I don't live in Squirrel Hill anymore to walk to this place once a week. When you live in or around the Squirrel Hill area, you are asked to answer one simple question; Aiello's or Mineo's. I choose Aiello's, though Mineo's is pretty damn good too. It's something about Aiello's sauce that puts it over the top for me. I've never had a better local pizza in Pittsburgh. The staff are pretty friendly, especially if you frequent their shop often. There's specialty pizzas, pizza by the slice, hoagies, desserts, salads and other items. It is a little on the pricey side especially for the specialty pizzas. When I ordered the Margherita pizza once, the owner discussed with me how he only uses locally grown produce for his pizza toppings. Locally used produce, owned and delicious....that's my style!  http://www.aiellospizza.com/menu.html"}
{"text":"We were on a hunt to find our go-to pizza place in Squirrel Hill. After having Mineos a couple times we set to try Aiello's. And, as much as I wanted the pizza to be good, it just wasn't. The main ingredients of pizza are: cheese, dough and the sauce. We liked none of it, specially the cheese was bland and not tasty at all. So, that was our first and last time ordering at Aiello's. For now. I might give them another chance though since we order pizza often for weekends and it is priced reasonably."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but not exceptional. The crust was fair, the sauce was excellent. The price was $18 for a large pizza. Considering the quality price and everything else, I rate it four stars.  I would go one more time.  Sauce was very good."}
{"text":"I have lived in Pittsburgh all my life, 58 years, and had not been to Aiello's in over a year.  I was very disappointed in what I found.  The salad I ordered came in a plastic container and was served with a packet of dressing, flimsy utensils, and a paper plate.  The meatball hoagie was poor.  The roll, sauce, and cheese were hot but the meatballs were cool in the center as if they were taken out of the fridge and put directly in the oven without enough time to heat through.  The pizza sauce is very sweat and lacking in the cheese that really used to make these pies great.  I had to clean off my own table and the staff calls you up when your order is ready.  The staff seemed bored and at 8pm on a Sat. night the place was nearly empty......3 occupied booths.  It was an unfortunate experience considering that when the original owner was there the food and staff were much better.  Lots of other choices in this area and I will not be returning to Aiello's."}
{"text":"Not the best in the world but it is cheap and the service is good. I got the veggie roll with the side of marinara. They weren't too busy i guess, but they were nice and even asked me after I ordered if I would like my marinara sauce warmed up!   Only problem is that the ingredients don't look the freshest. I saw someone get a mushroom topping on a pizza slice. They took a cooked pizza slice and added what looked like canned mushrooms on top, but they added a lot of it. So you get what you pay for, and this place is a good deal."}
{"text":"Love it. Went back last weekend after not being in the area for a long time and it was just how I remembered. Its nothing fancy inside but everyone is down to earth, friendly and takes pride in their pizza making! They are making some renovations but its a well needed freshening up considering the competition in the area is doing the same. Glad to see things have not changed!"}
{"text":"By far, hands down my favorite pizza ever!!  I have friends that are Mineos people but I am just not one of them. When it comes to a good pizza, having a little sugar in my pizza sauce is exactly what the doctor ordered!   Best pie around! You can get a single slice or a whole pie right off the top no waiting involved!  Love!"}
{"text":"Overall:  Cash only sucks but there are ATMs within walking distance. So get past the gruff service and blinding interior, and enjoy why you're there: an amazing non-Neapolitan pie and best in Pittsburgh.  _________________________________ Ambiance: 2/5. Occasionally overrun by local highschoolers, especially on weekend nights, that's the lesser of two issues here. Prepare for fluorescent hell--white walls and table-tops turning this into an operating room. It's bland and outdated. Empty pizza box stacks and storage within diner's site doesn't help. _________________________________ Service: 3/5.  I don't mind the service after fifty or so trips. Essentially serve-yourself after you place your counter order. When placing, it's short, to the point, and occasionally warm or even playful. For newcomers, the gruff may be off-putting, and the shit-giving may stun, but get past it and realize it does little to detract once your order is placed. Pay when you leave, takeout or sit-down. _________________________________ Drinks: 1/5. Not serving alcohol or water at a sit-down is 1/5. Soda from the coolers bottled, so no refills. _________________________________ Food: 5/5. I've had most toppings and combos here over the years. I'll generalize as R/W and note significant details. After 20+ years, this is my #1 pizza in Pittsburgh, and when on point, among the best I've eaten in Baltimore, DC, NYC, Chicago, Naples, and Rome.   1) Red Pizza - excellent sauce. It's juicy and thin, fantastically sweet, and finishes with a lightly biting salt. Cheese is stellar too, though only mozzarella available. The dough is not quite crisp, but it's very fresh, fantastic flavor throughout, and the flour-dusted crust is soft yet perfectly chewy. Vegetables are canned, yes, but AIellos puts them under the cheese (might need to request it). This allows flavors to meld, particularly with the sauce. This is no truer than with the pepperoni, where the meat imparts spiciness to the sauce as it begins cooling. The interplay becomes something fantastic, a spicy contrast to the rest of the pie, and it totally won me over years ago. It's what sets it apart from regulars like Mineos, Fioris, Bado's, Vincent's (now closed), and the like.  2) White Pizza - Always order a small. The crust comes out flakier, crispier, and more flavorful. An appropriately light amount of garlic. The Parmesan dusting completes the texture. Most toppings work, but get the stewed tomatoes. It's probably the best pizza here, even better than the red sauce-pepperoni. The tomatoes burst with flavor and sweetness, offsetting the bitterness of Parmesan and garlic, and add a juicy quality to the thick, doughy, and occasionally dry experience. It's the intricacy and texture of a great white pizza with all the flavors and freshness of a sweet red."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite pizza places. Went to pick up a pizza and the guy in othe window making the pizza had a very long uncovered beard. I'm sorry but that is not acceptable in the food industry. Downright gross!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite of the many pizza places in Squirrel Hill. My wife's not a big fan of pizza and even she likes it. It's a little overpriced as far as pizza goes but probably comparable to some of the others in the area.   I usually just stop in for a couple of plain slices, slice of margarita, or a pepperoni roll. The sauce is definitely what sets them apart."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have ordered pizza / salads from here a few times now and I'd rate it as a solid American style pizza place.  The cheese and toppings are tasty, but the sauce (mainly due to its overabundance) and crust could be improved somewhat.  The main reason we continue to occasionally order from here is probably due to their great house salad and home made italian dressing.  The salad is loaded up with a large variety of toppings including pepperoni, fresh tomatoes, and an abundance of cheese which when combined with the excellent dressing results in a great side to go along with the average pizza.  Their decision to accept cash only is really annoying and prevents me from ordering from here more often, which is only exacerbated by the fact that everything they sell is really expensive."}
{"text":"White pizza was phenominal. Regular pepperoni was kind of meh. The crust was so good on both though!"}
{"text":"They sure don't make it easy. No delivery, cash only, expensive, a royal pain to park on weekends. At the same time, I'm more than willing to endure herculean trials in pursuit of top tier pizza (hour and a half on the subway to Di Fara? no problem!)   I like the extra flour caked onto the crust, and the sauce isn't bad, but I see and taste nothing that could possibly come close to justifying the $30 price tag on a large gourmet. As a point of reference my favorite pizza on planet earth, Paulie Gee's, is $17. I can assure you PG does not cheap out on ingredients, and there is no way commerical rent is cheaper in Brooklyn than Murray Ave. So while there are far worse pies (really most places in town are worse, and maybe that explains the hype), it's not special enough for the special-occasion pricing."}
{"text":"Memories, came to get a couple of cuts of cheese pizza when visiting Pittsburgh to see a Pirate game. I judge how good pizza is  plain with no toppings and this is as good as I remember it in high school, way back in 1979. This is not the place to get your yuppie pesto with chicken, it is a pizza joint like where I live now in the Tacoma area we have Teriyaki joints, you do not go to these places for atmosphere,  or a dining experience, you go for a specific food done well."}
{"text":"No one believes me when I say the best pizza is in Pittsburgh, but it's true. Hard to choose between Mineo's and Aiello's.  But from this far away, I would say it's a tie.  (OK - I'll admit it - I prefer Aiello's)"}
{"text":"Always great!!  Never disappoints. When I visit the burg, i always stop here!!  Top quality ingredients baked to perfection."}
{"text":"I lost a little faith in this city by how celebrated this place is. Serviceable at best. Cheese blend is highly questionable, mine was rubbery really. Crust was ok. If you think this is the ultimate then I question your dedication to pizza consumption.  PS: The spot is cash only, which is also annoying."}
{"text":"I just got back from Pgh.  We ate at Aiello's only twice (It was only a three day visit).  One meal was four star, the other five.  The difference?  Reheated \"cuts\" are way better than made to order pies.  The dough transcends excellent the second time on the stone.  Trust me."}
{"text":"Not sure of the validity of these 5 star reviews for this hole. The slices are itty-bitty, little shit ass things, barely enough substance to fill up a toddler or a granny. Grease laden, cracker- like triangles . won't go back, been there done that . unsatisfying as hell. Staff was friendly."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for (cha-ching).  Delicious.  The end."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, there aren't a ton of great pizza delivery places in our neighborhood.  After the last place we used to order from a lot served us a mosquito in our last pie, we jumped shipped, and decided to go for pick up.  Thus, our first pie from Aiello's.  TIP - CASH ONLY (there is a cash machine inside) and NO DELIVERY.  That being said, I ordered for pick-up on a Friday night.  20 minutes.  Perfect!  Even though the shop is located on one of the main drags in Squirrel Hill, I was able to find parking right across the street from the shop.  When I came into the shop, all the tables were filled.  Its a small place, so that's pretty easy.  You could tell is was a very popular place.  There are a couple cold cases where you can buy beer (decent selection) and, of course, Turner's Tea (only in da 'burg!).  The peeps working were friendly and checked me out fast.  I was in and out in 10 minutes, with a piping hot pizza in hand.  Now, for the most important part - the taste.  Welp, what do you think, given I gave it 4 stars.  Pretty damn good!  Even though we have to go through the extra step of picking up the pizza, we'll probably continue to order from here for our Friday night pizza movie nights."}
{"text":"I grew up in Pittsburgh and Aiello's used to be my No. 1...anywhere...and I've had the best: Pepe's and Sally's in New Haven, CT; Di Fara's in Brooklyn; John's of Bleecker Street in Manhattan. Anyway, I was in Pittsburgh back in August and did the Aiello's-Mineo's comparison and Aiello's came out on top, again, like it normally does. However, I went back over the holidays and it was only very average. My friend and I then walked down to Mineo's and we liked it much, much better. First time ever for me did I have Mineo's above Aiello's (don't get me wrong, Mineo's is great, but I've always preferred Aiello's). While home we even did Vincent's (down on Ardmore Blvd) and that came in above Aiello's too (for the record I had Vincent's at No. 1, then Mineo's, and only then Aiello's).   I was dumbfounded. What happened to Aiello's?  So on Christmas I'm talking to my uncle and he says that he recently had Aiello's as well and he said something must have changed because he too thought it was only average. Ah-ha! I wasn't crazy after all.   Not sure what happened but I think there was a management change or something. They've done some remodeling and I heard that the sons took over for the father maybe. I'll give it another try when I'm back in town, but for now, it seems like changes have been had for the worst."}
{"text":"Very solid pie. Probably my favorite in the city. Definitely my preference when compared to Mineo's. A little bit lighter and I liked the crust more."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in PGH and great family."}
{"text":"I always love the Stromboli here and I have found the gentlemen working here to be just lovely.  That said: canned mushrooms are gross and that's why I only order the pepperoni Stromboli and no veggies. Cash only is also annoying and stop being so cheap."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in town! The cheese, the sauce, the crust! It's all amazing and makes for a beautiful pizza pie!  -It's cash only  - Currently remodeling while Open -the best pizza in the burgh"}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but this is my favorite pizza place in all of Pittsburgh! Can't go wrong with Aiello's. It's small and cozy, but it's exactly what I'd expect from a pizza place on Sq. Hill. Late college night? Try this pizza. It is amazing, it is delicious, and I wish I could go here more often."}
{"text":"Damn, yo, I'm from Jersey and have a high standard for good pizza. Aiello's pizza was slightly sweet, salty and greasy from the fresh mozz, and with flavorful, crunchy crust. Just describing it makes my mouth water. Plus they have a plethora of classic sodas and beer that HIT THE SPOT"}
{"text":"When a street has several pizza places within a few blocks of one another, it's hard to choose. Despite the construction outside of Aiello's, my husband decided to stop in to check it out.   Initial thought was that it's a little pricier than other pizza places. We ordered a small (8 cut) pepperoni, which was about $15. The pizza was decent, which I liked the crust. FYI, they put the cheese on top of the toppings.   Overall, the pizza wasn't bad and the service was good."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The crust was a little on the thin side for my liking but it still was good.   Personable people working the counters and was able to grab a slice on the go.  Of to test the next page."}
{"text":"I have to agree with mostly everyone below. This is simply the best pizza I have had in Pittsburgh. Being from Buffalo, where the pizza is just good,  I appreciate that Aiello's could take on my hometown favorites. Everything I have had here has been good - even the pizza that had mashed potatoes instead of sauce (OK so it was pretty filling, but still good - I would eat it again!) They only take cash, but they are open everyday till 2am and totally worth the pick-up (yeah they don't deliver either).  But best pizza. Seriously."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Pittsburgh, it's a little pricey but it is well worth it and I would go there again"}
{"text":"Words cannot explain what happens after your soul has been touched by this pizza! I wish there was pizza like this in Minnesota!  WOWZERS!   My husband and I shared a Large Sausage/Mushroom and it was beyond FABULOUS!   BTW the sausage is made in-house!   The crust is AMAZING!   No worries, they most definitely give you enough REAL CHEESE!   Out of all the food I tried in Pittsburgh this weekend, I will miss this pizza the most!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Pittsburgh. The staff is friendly and professional! We are New Yorkers and we love this place."}
{"text":"I really thought they were my favorite pizza of all time. Ordering a whole pizza- it was a cheesy mess of amazing. SO GOOD.  BUT I had a big disappointing visit last time. We are too poor to afford 30 dollar pizza all the time so when we need a fix we went in for slices.  I got the pizza in the rack when you first walk in.   My crust was so hard and chewy it was obvious it was old pizza. Like bad old pizza. Like all day sitting out old pizza.  So I still like the whole pie, but mineo's can give me both good pie AND slices. I know its a pizza war out there in sq. Hill, but I think I have finally picked a side. Mineo's for me please."}
{"text":"I just went here to grab two slices of pizza. I got feta cheese and chicken on my pizza. The guy took an already made cheese pizza and just threw some nasty ass looking feta cheese and halfway done chicken on top of my slices. Looked like vomit. This pizza is so triflin ! Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Being disappointed by one of their neighboring pizza places, I went in here not expecting much better, but I was wrong.  This was one of the best slices I've ever had.  I'm so glad this place is right around the corner from me.  (I still wish these places took credit cards, though.)"}
{"text":"I love their pizza! Amazeballs! I've tried their rivals pizza and I didnt like it as much as Aiello's. Correct me if i'm wrong but the crust is yummers! I'm not even from Pittsburgh but my MF is and he loves the other place. Oh well, to each his own. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Aiello's is a great pizza. The pepperoni are those itty bitty round kind that pucker up and look sort of like an octopus tentacle suction cup full of oil. That's actually a bit of a downer, even though they taste great.  I go to Aiello's for the Italian hoagie, which I find to be the best in the area.  When I want pizza, I go down the block to Mineo's. But if I want an Italian hoagie, it's Aiello's for me."}
{"text":"The pizza was cheap and tasty, and best of all: HAND TOSSED.  However, anyone who has visited Chicago, would never give their pizza 5 stars... that should be reserved for truly great pizza."}
{"text":"They either burnt our pizza and tried to pass it off as normal or their pizza just sucks and pittsburgh is clueless.  Either way thumbs down.  Didn't help that they added in their own tip."}
{"text":"Unquestionably delicious!  I picked this place to meet a friend because of the reviews and I was not ONLY not disappointed, I was wowed.  The staff was one of the friendliest I have ever encountered at a pizza parlor which is very nice.  They chatted freely, came over to the table, asked how we were doing. They wanted to be sure that we were having a good time.  WE SURE DID.  They are very trusting and welcoming.  NEXT.  There was a huge selection to choose from.  I was there for pizza, but some people came in for pepperoni rolls that looked like savory little nuggets of goodness, plus lots of other food that I didn't really pay attention to. (lots of variety)  They had a huge listing of gourmet pizzas, but almost any pizza could be made and served by the slice.  My friend ordered two slices of something and mushroom and you couldn't even SEE the pizza there were so many toppings.  And they were fresh and delicious!    QUALITY.  I love white pizza and rarely find any I ever like.  THEIRS IS FANTASTIC.  I want to go back, I will go back, if you haven't gone go now!     Definitely order a pizza, it's worth it.  :-)"}
{"text":"Food is good here the service is great and it is always busy.  This place is a staple and a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Single cut vs whole pie.  When I order cuts, it seems like there is too much grease.  When I order a whole pie everything comes together.  Aiello's has the best crust that you will ever consume. My six year old son and I finished a whole large pizza in one sitting.  Neither of us are overweight.  He said \"daddy this is the best pizza that I have ever eaten.\"  He must be my son because I agreed.  I love there pizza and come from Oakmont to get it about 2X/month.  Stamp of approval."}
{"text":"Mineo's did not cut it for me so I decided to give Aiello's a try and I'm glad I did because it was so much better. I wont ever crave it but at least the cheese and sauce are good and it's not super greasy like Mineo's. I'm still looking for that slice of pizza that makes me want more.  Don't know if I will ever find it here but I must continue my search."}
{"text":"Awesome as always.  First stop that I make when I get to Pittsburgh. West Pizza Coast SUCKS. You will find a no finer pizza in the city.  Don't bother with the other guys down the street."}
{"text":"Better pizza than mineo's, except the staff has more than the avg. number of assholes. Slices in house are pretty good, with chewy, substantial crust, and they often have a good sauce-to-cheese ratio. However...whole pies are lackluster and seem sloppy. Open late, but these guys can be pretty unneccessarily catty to a drunk person who's just trying to buy a few slices of pizza. Walk up the street to Italian Village Pizza if it's not too late!"}
{"text":"I tried to pay about four times before I finally figured it out.  You don't pay when you order, you don't pay when you pick out a drink, you don't pay when you pick up the pizza, you don't pay until you're leaving the place. So bizarre, but whatever works for them.  Aiello's is a small little walk in pizza place in Squirrel Hill.  I went there after a hard Sunday afternoon bouldering, so I was hungry.  Four of us split a large pepperoni pizza which set us back about $20.  Filled us up enough, but not enough that we didn't go to Waffalonia after.  Neat neighborhood place, filled up quick with Steelers fans after the game was over."}
{"text":"Have you ever seen that episode of the Simpsons where Ned Flanders loses his house and Homer helps rebuild it and it's the most cumbersome and thoughtless piece of junk ever - to the point where Ned goes insane because why even bother?  Whatever charm Aiello's had before the remodel is totally sapped. It's like walking into an ICU. The lights are WAY too bright, the TVs are awkwardly low so you can't see them from any of the seating aside from the bar seats - even half of the very small bar seating is blocked from the TVs because of the beer taps. The TV is placed right behind the taps, obscuring the view.  When the Pens game was on it was whisper quiet, although the bar was full. The sound from the TVs is completely inaudible, while Aiello's decided to play some weird reggae-jazz fusion instead.   Just a bizarre, boring experience. Wouldn't suggest it for any dining-in until they fix the TVs. Why even have them if you can't see or hear anything?  Go a couple buildings down to Mineo's (I don't even LIKE Mineo's!) for a real experience. A little (lot) more dim. More cheerful atmosphere. Better sound and TV system. There's just no real reason to eat in Aiello's now. I've never been in a brighter room in my life.  Also the mirror in the men's bathroom is waist-high. So weird."}
{"text":"The pizza is good. It's a little pricey, especially since it is pretty typical pizza you can find anywhere else. The beer selection is good, though. And the renovations make the place look super nice and modern."}
{"text":"I like Aeillo's way better than Mineos! Mineo's is way too greasy for my taste. Look at the cheese sweat on those cuts! Not just that but, they're friendlier at Aiello's with better Italian sausage and ... how can you say no to a cute smile and a butt like that little Mikey Aiello's?! He's so cute and sweet! Mikey you can slice my dough anytime pal! For real though everyone there is very helpful, kind and quick too!   Go to Aiello's ... scratch Mineo's."}
{"text":"I was raised in Lodi NJ where most of the population was Italian. They had great Pizza. Aiello's Pizza came the closest to that of any place I have been to in Pittsburgh. Most of Pgh Pizza is oily, soggy and messy. Aiello's  was none of these. Even reheated at home latter (leftovers) it was better that any other in this town"}
{"text":"Pizza is damn good. Comparable to what I've had in Italy. Only issue is it's overpriced and there are some real assholes on staff there."}
{"text":"I don't really get the appeal. I just moved to the area, so I'm unbiased. The pizza was fine, kinda soggy, a bit too sweet. Nothing special. I did appreciate the good beer selection in the back though! Service is also good, and staff are friendly."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in the city of Pittsburgh. The new renovations look great and the pizza is just as good. Very great bang for your buck too. Really enjoy how everything is made right there in front of you and everyone there is so nice. I really love the smell of the place too. If you want a good slice THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO! I hope you all enjoy and have fun eating the best pie in the burgh"}
{"text":"I was excited by the rave reviews of this pizza joint, but somewhat disappointed. What's the deal with Pittsburgh pizza restaurants and canned toppings? If I order mushrooms, I want them to be fresh!  To be fair, the crust and sauce were fine, and I think the meat pizzas are probably ok. If I went back, I would probably stick with cheese pizza."}
{"text":"WAY too expensive. Pizza is just okay, I don't understand the hype about this place when you have two of the best in the city up the street at Mineo's and Napoli.  Go to those places, much better product at a normal price. Aiello's prices are absurd!"}
{"text":"I love pizza. More than I should admit. Moving from a small town to Pittsburgh widened my options. I've made it a goal to try as many different pies this city has to offer. No need to read further. Just go. Now.   Aiello's is my go to everytime. I crave it. Nothing has yet to compare. Start with a crispy but not too crusty underbelly and a mild chewy but not too soft center. Baked to perfection. The sauce is the epitome of Italian spice profiles. Not sweet from added sugar like you so often find but a natural hint of the sweetness from the tomatoes. The cheese. Oh the cheese!   Go to Aiello's. Right now. The price is worth every mouthwatering bite. Why are you still reading this? Go."}
{"text":"This pizza is absolutely delicious. We are in town for a work/pleasure trip and  went based on other yelp recommendations and were not dissappointed. Their red pizza was a perfect blend of crust, sauce and cheeses. Very tasty. We also ordered a white pie with spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms ( I don't know that they were canned, but they seemed to be precooked) and sweet white onions.  The crust was smeared with a sort of garlic oil spread, then the toppings and finished with a blend of cheeses. It arrived perfectly cooked and piping hot from the oven.  There are a few booths in the back with a sort of help yourself drink set-up. The staff could not have been any friendlier. This will be our go to pizza place the next time we are in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place over the years, specifically the debate between Mineo's and Aiello's from their respective fans... but when our office intern kept raving about Aiello's, we knew we had to try it out for his last day.  You order when you arrive, pick out your drinks, and pay when you leave (CASH ONLY!)... we ordered a large white pizza (the intern's recommendation) and a large pepperoni.  There were 6 of us, so we found it a bit difficult to figure out seating, since they only have booths that comfortably seat 4 -- but we were able to secure 2 booths directly across from one another.  Not a big deal, just don't come here with everyone you know and expect to have a large place to eat in.    Once the pizzas arrived and essentially took up most of the table space, we dug in. I preferred the white pizza over the pepperoni.  The crust was just thin enough, cooked perfectly, and the cheese was sturdy enough to withstand actually picking the slice up and eating it.  The pepperoni was a bit flimsier, I'm assuming from all the grease, and required a knife and fork.  I only had one slice of the pepperoni before the devil on my shoulder dressed in a Fiori's t-shirt advised me that this pepperoni pie was just OK and, in my opinion, can't hold a candle to my beloved South Hills pizza joint.  I managed to snag one more piece of white pizza and eat it before starting to wish I had worn stretchy pants.  To sum it up -- Aiello's is good, but it's not great. I've had plenty of better pizza in this city, but to each their own. Some prefer sweeter sauce, some prefer more cheese, thinner crust, the list goes on and on.  I know most mom & pop pizza spots in this city have their following and I don't see Aiello's going anywhere ever... I'm just not sure it'd be my first choice when I'm craving a traditional pizza pie."}
{"text":"I understand that there is nostalgia and myth surrounding this pizza shop, but the current reality is that the pizza mediocre. It's better than some pizza options, but it doesn't deserve the hype that it gets. The crust is super thin (which I like), but lacks flavor and texture, the sauce lacks zest, and the cheese is just there.   I wanted to love Aiello's; the staff was fantastic, the restaurant has that great old pizzeria vibe, but unfortunately the product is just not good enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"My favorite from grad school.  Perhaps the best thing about Squirrel Hill and we were sad to leave. 15 years later I'm back and loving it.  Newly expanded.  Still cash only.  Still awesome."}
{"text":"My boyfriend has been coming here since he was literally a baby and it is hands down his favorite pizza place in the burgh. It's hard for me to convince him to eat anywhere else when we are in the squirrel hill area.   Aiello's is a pretty awesome place. The employees are always friendly and welcoming when you arrive. They also have a pretty awesome selection of craft beer- six packs or individual beers. I had \"morgazm\" by duclaw the other day- a grapefruit infused blonde ale- amazing!   When my boyfriend and I go, we always get their pepperoni pizza. The pizza is overall much thinner than a lot of pizza places in the area and the sauce is packed with flavor... It's delicious. We went with a few friends the other day and they ordered the pierogie pizza. This was my first time trying a pierogie pizza, but I wasn't overall impressed by it. It was cheesy, with mashed potatoes and sautéed white onions.. Without sauce- which I absolutely require in a pizza, haha.   Overall- Aiello's is an awesome pizza joint. The perfect place to have a beer and kick back with some awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Aiello's has gotten better in recent years as some of the more unpleasant employees have left so that's a bonus. In the sq hill pizza wars, I think Aiello's has the best pepperoni and plain white pizza on the block."}
{"text":"Maybe a step down from Mineos Pizza which is not that great either. I agree with yelpers who identify a sweet taste. How do Mineos and Aiello's have such good reputations? It is a mystery to me?"}
{"text":"bEST Pizza in the NorthEast? in the USA?  Ive been a Mineo person for 20 years but last time in Pittsburgh, I tried Aiello's, I'm definitely going back, its hard to choose between the two, but I think Ive converted to Aiello's!!  Grazie! Grazie!  Go 'Bucs and Pens!"}
{"text":"My pizza ratings for Pittsburgh: #1 Mineo's #2 Fiori's #3 Aiello's  That said, a bronze medal is pretty damn good!  Solid slices. No BS."}
{"text":"Went there since the vegetarian spot next door was closed.  Pizza is pretty good.  I'd eat the crust alone..yummy.  Nice staff...I'm killing my diet!"}
{"text":"My husband  and I decided to have a lazy day, maybe look for a couple of Christmas gifts, and just kinda hang out in the neighborhood.  After finding one gift for my Dad we decided to get some lunch.  Honestly, Squirrel Hill has so many great places that it's tough to decide.  We decided on getting some pizza, but which one?  Again, there are so many.  We decided upon Aiello's and called ahead to place our order.  You can eat there or take out.   We took it back to my place.  We decided upon the \"White Pie\"  which is butter-garlic sauce and provolone cheese.  We got a 12-cut, 16oz pizza with tomatoes, spinach, and sausage on it.  I figured my husband could eat the leftovers for lunch.  The pizza was very good, but a little pricey here.  It was something like $25.00 for ours.  Oh and it's \"cash-only\", but they do have an on-site ATM.  For your convenience!"}
{"text":"A few variations on classic pizza, the cheese is oddly bland, the sauce is a little sparse, but the crust is indeed perfect. One of the few places that cooks pizza long enough to get some burn on the cheese, which is necessary. Comparable to IVP, way better than Mineo's."}
{"text":"Never ending construction and bad service. Used to be my favorite place, way to mess it up."}
{"text":"Arrogance.... The number two pizza place in pittsburgh has the awful service..... Pizza might be good.... But in usa you can't be rude to customers..... You won't sustain.... Just followed yelp and went to this place..... Disappointed now!!!!"}
{"text":"Their pizza is not awesome.  I have never lived around the corner or even relatively close for the sole reason that their pizza is so not awesome.  The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is because their bathroom makes a really nice spot to meet other men, if you know what I mean ;)  Their workers can be pretty tense and mean ;)"}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh, you cannot beat Aiello's...and honestly, as I travel more and more - I'm beginning to realize you can't beat it anywhere.  Let me first address several issues that I've found with other reviews:  1) A sweet taste to the sauce...absolutely, and it's amazing that way (high quality).  If you don't like it, go order Papa John's and get sauce from a 5 year old can.  2) This is not New York-style pizza.  I have no idea where people got that idea.  New York-style pizza is known for wide cuts with a thin crust.  Aiello's is nothing like that.  The cuts are \"normal\" sized and have a delicious crust that is finely balanced between thick and thin.  It's not a Chicago deep dish and it's not cheese & sauce on paper like New York...it's a happy medium.  3) Mineo's was the original but has since gone down hill.  This is where you want to go.  Aiello's will be cleaner with higher quality ingredients and a better crowd.  With all of that said, Aiello's has increased their prices in recent years and I'm growing a little tired of that...somehow inflation is 3 percent but at Aiello's it's 10 or 20 percent.  Doesn't make sense to me...but then again, I haven't lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years and because Pittsburgh is so inexpensive - I don't even notice when I come back for a slice (it's still cheaper than pizza in other cities).  Final recommendations:  - Get two slices \"off the top\" and don't have it reheated.  I promise you, you'll never look back.  - Bring cash, they don't take cards.  - Grab one of those Car Mart magazines from the counter by the front door and you'll have something to read while you eat."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Mineo's not knowing that Aiello's right up the street on the same side of the street existed. As with Mineo's you either love it or hate it. I am kind of in-between. Depending on my mood I could really crave a slice of Aiello's. I won't take it out, it is a must eat in. The shop is little but has a few tables in the back.   The best part is the photo's on the wall. It appears that a Pittsburgh native went pro. Mike McCathy the Green Bay Packers Coach was from Greenfield and ate at Aiello's a lot.  Great picture.   I was introduced to Aiello's when a prior boss, would bring Aiello's into the break room for everyone during break to enjoy. He knew the owner and was given a free large pizza each visit, and in return he would share it with the staff.   where the pizza is good and CASH ONLY, the service is horrible. They lack any kind of friendliness. Seems to robotic to me, and lacking any kind of customer service. If you can get past that, the pizza is well worth a try."}
{"text":"We found success in our search for good food in Pittsburgh. The pizza was very good. I like the way the crust was cooked:  rustic and slightly charred. The sauce was rich and the amount of cheese just right. I don't care for an overwhelming amount of cheese on my pizza. My son had a slice of the stuffed pizza which had sausage and other ingredients sitting between a top and bottom slice of pie and he really enjoyed it.  They have an extensive menu of pizza and sandwiches and this made me wish that I could spend more time in Pittsburgh to try other items. I also like the pay as you leave setup. And, one thing I really appreciated was the staff looking out for its customers by warning us that there was a meter maid outside the building giving tickets.."}
{"text":"When you're in Pittsburgh, you choose between Aiello's or Mineo's. Most people choose Aiello's, and it's not hard to understand why. The za doesn't LOOK great, as compared to others in Pittsburgh, but it TASTES most excellent. The sauce is somewhat sweet and somewhat spicy, the cheese is decadently salty. The crust is a bit dry, but not horrible. I could eat this pizza for the rest of my life and never be sad. (In the end, I choose Mineo's over Aiello's, but Aiello's is an A+ pizza.)"}
{"text":"Coldplay bought a slice. They bought a slice for you. In fact they bought another two. And they were all Aiello.  I love Pitt style pizza. It's done best by 2 places.. Fiori and Aiello. You should try both of them and decide for yourself which is superior. Aiello is in the much trendier part of town, but is probably my second fave of the two. Still it's easily 5-star pizza. And Pitt has some of the better has-its-own-style pizza of any town in the country, honestly. Only a handful (Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, NYC) are better to me.  So it's an excellent slice of dry, cheesy Pittsburgh-style Pizza. One of the highlights is watching them spin the dough and make the pies right in front of you. They're extremely busy and hectic at the best of times, so don't expect them to always hit the nail on your proverbial head with regards to order accuracy."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in Aiello's.  It was New Year's Day, and my husband and I did not feel like cooking.  We mistakenly thought Aiello's would satiate our hunger.  Long story short-- I get the $40 pizza & jalapeno poppers home only to find canned mushrooms on the pizza and no cheese in the poppers.  Ugh."}
{"text":"My first adventure when visiting Pittsburgh was to decide for myself who had the best pizza in town - Mineo's or Aiello's. There's long been a debate between the two local pizzerias, located only a block or so from each other. I ordered one slice of pepperoni to go, headed to Aiello's and did the same, settled in at a bistro table along Murray Ave. and prepared my test slices. There is an obvious difference in the look of the slices and my first guess, based on appearance as best slice, went to Aiello's. But in all reality, looks don't matter so I dug in. The verdict? Mineo's won hands down because of its sauce, grease and cheese. However, Aiello's should not be ignored.  The slice was good.  Crispy crust, hot out of the oven and had sort of a sweet tomato sauce.   In 1967, Giuseppe, \"Joe,\" Aiello set sail for America from Palermo, Sicily to catch a fleeting dream. With only 13 dollars in his pocket, Giuseppe left his family, confident that the land of opportunity would provide more than an income but of the life he had dreamed about.   After years of kneading dough and simmering sauce for an employer, Giuseppe decided to fulfill his dream and open his own pizza shop.  April 5, 1978 marked the opening of Aiello's Pizza on Murray Ave. On May 13, 2013 Giuseppe passed away. Now his son, Michael, will continue the tradition Giuseppe started."}
{"text":"Fast Forward  Every trip from NYC to Pitt includes a visit to Aiello's. And if we know anyone driving East, we request a transfer!  If you are in search of fancy \"gourmet\" pizza, go elsewhere.  At Aiello's, you order the pizza you specify - and it is absolutely perfect!"}
{"text":"The best pizza, period.  Mineo's is fine.  Nothing wrong with it.   But Aiello's is not only better, but the place is much cleaner and staff much nicer.  No atmosphere to speak of.  No delivery.  No parking.  Cash only.  Just good f'in' pizza.  It is the first place friends who have moved away eat at when the come home to visit."}
{"text":"About a month ago, I went to Aiello's Pizza.  I decided to join the crowd and wait to write the review until I tried Mineo's.  This was an interesting tactic, as I usually write reviews pretty quickly and just save them as drafts if I don't want to post them immediately.  So this is what was special about Aiello's:  I don't really remember.  The pizza wasn't great and the pizza wasn't bad.  The crust was a medium thickness with a sweeter sauce and not as much cheese as I like.  I remember thinking that around $20 for a large cheese pizza seemed like too much.  As I was moving the day I got the pizza, delivery would have been really nice.  The storefront was standard pizza store.  But, kids, that's it.  Would I come back here?  Probably.  I might try the specialty pizzas or just order some different kinds by the slice.  But I just didn't think Aiello's was anything to write home about.  Cash Only"}
{"text":"When I walked in, the place smelled amazing. The pizza also looked awesome. I ordered a small to-go and sat at a table to wait for pizza to be made. It was a simple pizza with two toppings, yet I had employees come over 3 or 4 times to ask me \"what did you get again?\". I sat and waited for over 45 minutes for my pizza to be made, seeing many people who came in after me get served. The employees were all young and messing around. Many people that they seemed to know came in and they were chatting with them and served their orders first.  It also wasn't worth the wait. The crust was soggy on the bottom, the pizza wasn't cut all the way through, and the quality of the toppings left something to be desired."}
{"text":"11:24 pm.....Bomb ass pizzas, open late, cash only.  The guy behind the counter does not smile.  No pleasantries here. He must detect we are foreigners.  Fuckin' Californians, no less. There's pizza, stromboli, etc.  soda and beer are either in vending machines or coolers.  No taps, pitchers, etc.  The seating in the restaurant are all crappy hard white booths so take your food to go.  Greek pizza!  Is there meat in that?  I don't see any......Hell yeah, it's just burried under like a pound + of fetta/mozzarella/etc.  A large greek pizza, a gyro and a beer while we waited....$40 tab.  Quality food but Just food and a little on the pricey side.  Cash only is a little bit of a buzz-kill."}
{"text":"So good. Cash only.  Our go to squirrel hill pizza"}
{"text":"Meh. Sauce is over peppered and over spiced. Crust is good. Cheese is mediocre and toppings are skimpy. Overall overpriced and felt like I was paying for the name"}
{"text":"Good Pizza, Crappy Service   My bf and i were in the area. We had dinner plans set for an hour later, but didnt eat all day. I searched yelp to find some pizza by the slice and it suggested Aiello's.   Pizza is like $1.80 plus 30 cents for toppings. My bf wanted a margarita pizza, but the one they had offered looked old (and to be honest didnt really resemble margarita pizza). I considered a pepperoni roll, but figured a slice would fill me up more.   The pizza was okay, above average for sure. It had a sweet sauce and the crust wasnt limp or soggy. I normally ditch the ending crust of pizza but i enjoyed Aiello's.   This pizza is well deserving of 4 stars. The reason for my 3 star review is that all 3 workers seemed have a crappy attitude. We came in happy and hungry. We had questions on the menu so they knew that we were new. No one even bothered to smile at us or give us any detail on the pizza or the menu (Legit, not one smile from one person. Is it that hard to smile?). Their sour attitudes almost ruined the experience for us. Luckily the pizza (semi) made up for it.  -Cash Only-"}
{"text":"We knew this was going to be an adventure ....  We had to travel from Frederick to Cleveland to see my father in the hospital, so we figured we'd break the long drive home with a quick detour into Pittsburgh for dinner ... preferably the best pizza they had to offer. Internet research indicated Murray Ave (Squirrel Hill) is the hotspot - and it's an easy exit right off an interstate. So why not? Of course, we happened to pick the one weekend where they closed Squirrel Hill tunnel on I-376 and sent traffic through a winding maze of city streets - which meant we spent an extra hour in stop/go traffic getting to Murray St, and then an extra 2 hours in even worse conditions getting back out onto the interstate.  Once we parked in an official spot near the restaurant - as opposed to  the virtual parking spot the detour had become - we chose Aiellos; it  had fewer reviews than Mineos, but all positive (seemed people either loved or hated Mineos).  Hard to believe - but the pizza was actually worth it all. It was that good. Crust just perfectly crisp and yet slightly chewy. Flavorful, lightly sweet sauce. Cheese perfectly browned (not soggy and underdone like so many pizza shops near our home). Friendly staff (I tried to pay, and the younger guy at the counter said \"pay when you're done, if you don't like, don't pay at all\").   We had a plain cheese pizza (the true test), and another with sausage, roasted peppers, onions. Both were excellent.  Take cash - they don't take cards (but do have an ATM). Don't expect ambience - there's maybe half dozen hard booths and plastic utensils. No beer or wine ... though I think I read somewhere that you can bring your own (? - call them first).  This is a low key affair, but the pizza really is as good as everyone else is saying ..."}
{"text":"Good pizza but not as flavorful as Mineo's. It is crispy but not enough sauce for me. They have a large beer selection with tons of craft beer."}
{"text":"Several months ago, I ordered a white pie with stewed tomatoes from Aiello's for take out.  Because I was serving four people, I went with the extra large (18\"), which ran about $25.  The size of the pie was more than sufficient--in fact, I ended up with left overs.  When I called to order, the guy I spoke to told me to allow 40 min.  I was excited to try this pizza given its PGH cred.  In general, I'd call myself a fan of it, though I wouldn't call it the best pizza I've ever had, or even the best pizza I've had in PGH.  Honestly, it's hard for me to compare this pizza to others I've tried in PGH, given that most of them were standard margherita pies, and this was a white one.  Having said that, Aiello's pie was better than many of the mediocre pies I've tried around town.  The crust was nice and crispy, and the savory cheese and garlic base was complemented well by the juiciness and hint of sweetness of the stewed tomatoes.  My only major complaint was that the base of the pizza was rather dry, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out.  The juiciness of the stewed tomatoes definitely mitigated this shortcoming, however, so I'd recommend them as a topping.  Overall, Aiello's makes a solid and tasty, though rather expensive, pie.  If you're a fan of white or margherita pizza, I'd recommend the version I ordered.  Based on my experience, I'd order from them again if I happen to be hungry for pizza in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Very delicious deep dish pizza; had it both times that I've been here because it was just that good. As unhealthy as this greasy and salty meal can be for you (in addition to the sugar from the soda that you'll probably get), this pizza is immensely satisfying and just so good. Having one slice is enough to satisfy any pizza craving for a long time."}
{"text":"The pizza was fine, but I'm not sure why people love it so much. The cheese was good, the mushrooms clearly came from a can, the sauce was fine, and the crust was soggy. Plus, it was expensive and cash-only. They do have a nice beer selection. No highchairs available, but the staff were friendly to my rambunctious toddler. I had been planning to order from Aiello's for my daughter's birthday party, but DiGiorno's would be better. Meh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Pizza places in Pittsburgh. The sauce is one of the best I've had...and I'm originally from New Haven (home to some of the best pizza in the world) so I know what I'm talking about. Now granted, Aiello's is no Peppi's Pizza, it's still very good. Definitely overpriced and the \"cash-only\" thing is kind of annoying, but Hey, for Pittsburgh, if the Pizza doesn't look like an oil spill you should count your lucky stars."}
{"text":"Totally biased since I grew up eating here but I have never found that even comes close to this good.   My favorite is a small pizza with banana peppers and sausage.   Get the small rather than the large, the crust just turns out better with the small.  Italian hoagie with everything on it is a good option as well if you want more than just pizza, ask them to go heavy on the dressing.    A true Pittsburgh food landmark.  Grab a bite here and then catch a movie up the street or check out a great dive bar(Silkys)  next to the theater."}
{"text":"I ordered a plain cheese slice and a pepperoni one as well. I loved the crust and the cheese, but I was a bit disappointed by the sauce, it did not have much flavor. I wish it had been a bit more savory. Other than that, and the tiny size of the slices (I wand more!), this place is top notch! Will return!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I picked up a pizza at Aiellos. When our family wants a pizza \"treat\", we go there. I ordered at 8:40 pm and picked up my 8 cut, pepperoni and mushroom, green pepper and olive pizza, (nothing fancy but the $19 price)about 9 pm. The pizza looked beautiful. It tasted like it was reheated. The cheese was separated, the mushrooms had a slimy quality and there was no flavor to anything else. Very disappointed, no more overpriced Aiellos pizza for me! Oddly enough after watching MSNBC last week I will try another Squirrel Hill pizza institution. Last week while President Obama was in Pittsburgh, a smiling Howard Fineman made a comment on Hardball to the effect of, \"I hope he, referring to our President, gets a chance to stop at Mineo's for a pizza\". I have never had a Mineos pizza, but I trust Howard on all things political and now, on Pizza too.!! The poor quality of yesterday's pizza shocked us. Really, Aiellos, if you don't want to make a pizza on Sunday evening, please don't accept my order or my money."}
{"text":"I have lived in Pittsburgh my whole life and have frequented many pizza establishments... Their white pizza is absolutely the best it is inarguable.  You also cannot go wrong with their pepperoni rolls..."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh. The only place around that is better is Jioio's all the way out in Latrobe."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good. The employees not so much. I called twice tonight and was hung up on both times."}
{"text":"I went in to eat there this evening but saw a guy smoking an e-cigarette in the kitchen. Is that legal? ... No, it's not. I just looked it up. In Allegheny County Health Department's Food Safety rules, http://www.achd.net/food/pubs/pdf/art03.pdf, section 307.2 says \"Employees shall not use tobacco or e-cigarettes in any form while engaged in food preparation or service, while in areas used for food preparation, or equipment and utensil washing areas.\"  I would never smoke an e-cigarette, myself, and I don't want those chemicals in my food. I left Aiello's before ordering."}
{"text":"Really nice folks. Made my pizza fresh and ready. Btw, this pizza taste so good pre-heated (if you can't finish it in one sitting). Street parking can be a hassle as you have to pay to park on murray. But if you can find a spot on one of the side streets, chances are youre okay. Btw, crazy mocha is close by so you can get a fresh coffee while you wait for your pizza. Near major bus route too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza and fast service! The dough was my favorite and complemented the sauce well. The cheese could have more flavor in it. Loved the garlic butter sauce to go with the crust. Everything was fresh"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I don't like an over abundance of seasonings in my food. There must always be a balance between base and spice and the smaller the number of base ingredients, the more precarious that balance becomes. My preference is in direct contrast to my mother, since she LOVES a lot of the typical Italian American spices in abundance. I am not my mother.  Upon entering Aiello's, one can see the typical decor of this pizza parlor. Everything is plastic, white, and sterile and I'm direct contrast to the warm, wooden interiors of Mineo's. I put in our dinner order at the counter:  Italian Wedding Soup Small Pizza With Pepperoni Small Stromboli: Pepperoni Steak Bacon and Meatball; sauce on the side Bottled Water  The Wedding Soup arrived rather hot (microwaved) and in a styrofoam container. I am always wary of styrofoam adding flavor, but it didn't in this case. The soup was actually rather tasty and we split it between the two of us. I do have a fondness for a wedding soup that has a strong cheese flavor to it.   Our pizza was the next to arrive and looking at it I was a tad distressed as I could see all of the added seasoning and all of the seasoning in the sauce. I took a piece hoping the heat would sterilize the flavor of what appeared to be excess spice. I ate the entire piece but was not pleased. I took another piece to see if the cooling process had amplified the flavor and found that it had. I decided to wait on the stromboli.  I looked at my friend and asked him what he thought and he just grimaced. He is much more forgiving of over seasoned items than I am and he still stopped eating the pizza in favor of waiting for the stromboli.   When our stromboli arrived, I was happy that I ordered the sauce on the side. I served a piece to my friend and found, much to my chagrin, that sauce had also been placed inside the food. I had already committed both of us to trying the pizza pastry by this point and decided to move forward. What I tasted made me stop eating. Not only had they put sauce on the inside, but they had put a lot of extra Italian seasoning on the inside.   I don't know how people can eat this much Italian spice. I can only assume that the people that like this spicing of their food also like to eat spoonfuls of Italian seasoning out of the spice jar in the cupboard. If not for the Italian Wedding soup I would really want to give this parlor a zero star.   I will not return."}
{"text":"I don't want to throw gas on the never ending feud that is the Aiello's/Mineo's war, but let me give you some historical perspective.  In 1869, freshly returned from his reverse trip on the Oregon Trail, Erasmus Jebediah Aiello came to Pittsburgh only to find his arch nemesis/famous actor Sal Mineo had taken up residence in the middle of a giant hill.  Sal Mineo proceeded to whip an apple with amazing force hitting Erasmus right in his junk.  This made Sal Mineo laugh, and Erasmus, understandably, cry.  Swearing revenge, Erasmus used the skills he had learned from a mystical tribe of Native Americans and made a deal with the chief of the squirrels (his name was Benjamin) to fight Sal Mineo.  With the deal struck, the squirrels attacked Sal Mineo with all of their fury, and after an epic struggle, managed to kill him in 1976.  The crime was pinned on a drifter.  And since that day, the area surrounding the massacre has been known as \"Squirrel Hill.\"  After that, their ancestors coincidentally both opened pizza places on Murray Avenue, which was named after Bill Murray after he beat a steam driving machine in a race.  But I digress.  This place is unbelievable, and I am so glad that my wife introduced me to it.  If it's not the best pizza I have ever had in the area, it is at least in the top 3.  Either by the slice, or one of their specialty pizzas, I have never been disappointed.  On a personal note: Children of Erasmus (fun fact: that's what all the people that work at Aiello's like to be called), get a fucking credit card machine.  You officially do enough business to make it a convenience to your customers."}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday for dinner with my wife.  It had been a long time since I was last at Aiellos and my wife and I ended accidentally walking past it before doubling back and finally finding it.  The inside of Aiellos is currently under construction but they have a counter in the front and the a seating area with a bunch of lunch table like booths in the back.  At Aiello's you order at the counter, grab your drink from one of the coolers and then pay as you leave.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split an extra large (18\") cheese pizza.  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes from ordering until our food was ready.  This pizza like all pizzas can be broken down into its three major components: crust, sauce and cheese.  Of the three I think that the crust was my favorite at Aiello's.  I would consider it to be a thin crust pizza with a nice crisp bottom and the crust actually reminded me of a baguette, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My second favorite part of the pizza was the sauce which had a little sweetness at the first which was followed by a nice herby flavor.  Last but not least is the cheese which was decent also.  There was enough of it to cover the pie but not an excess of it.  The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't head back to Aiello's again in the future.  With the generally good review I probably have you scratching my head over that and while I will say that the pizza was pretty good, at $25 for a cheese pizza, I just think it costs way too much."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in the burgh. Their pizzas are very good!  Not a typical pizza experience, but I had a bowling group draft at Aiellos where they were able to reserve the back portion of the restaurant for a group of about 30. Aiellos was great about feeding us, and adding to the tab whenever we decided we were still hungry they would simply ask us how many slices/pies, what toppings, and then brought it out to us when it was ready. They also allowed us to use their tv to project from a laptop to make tracking the draft results easier. The seating was perfect since there were plenty of tables, and the bar next to us so we could also watch the NCAA playoff game(Bama won :/)  The pies were all nice and hot, and tasted great. I tried 3 different pies -  regular, pepperoni, and banana pepper. I enjoyed all of them very much.  The environment was noisy due to 30 grown men taking up a large portion of the place, but that was just part of the atmosphere. Can't expect a pizza place to be quiet or it probably means they don't get much business.   I'll def go back"}
{"text":"When I visited Pittsburgh for the first time my girlfriend did nothing but rave about Mineo's and how it's the best pizza in the world and that Aiello's is a horrible impostor. I tried Minoe's and then, to be fair, cleaned my palete with a fine wash down of Dr. Peper before walking over to Aiello's to compare. I did this partially to piss of the girlfriend because she is a staunch Mineo's fan and was near vomiting when she walked in to Aiello's.  What I determined: Aiello's is basically like Billy Baldwin and Mineo's is Alec Baldwin. I mean they are still Baldwins but at least Alec can act and isn't a total wiener.  The pizza tasted like junk. The peperoni sucked, the cheese sucked, the crust sucked. I couldn't even finish it. I immediately walked back over to Mineo's and had another slice of their delicious pizza heaven.     Marion's in Dayton, Ohio is the best pizza in the world to settle the argument."}
{"text":"I grew up in Forest Hills (east of Pittsburgh) which means I was born and raised to love and worship Vincent's Pizza Park.  It has taken me several decades to realize and admit this but Aiello's Pizza is actually the #1 pizza in Pittsburgh (yes - even ahead of Mineo's).  If you have any snotty friends from New York City who say that Pittsburgh pizza is worthless, send them to Aiello's to shut them up.   R.I.P. Vinny - great pies and infamous stories still hold a special place in my memories.  Long live Aiello's."}
{"text":"Best Pizzia in Pittsburgh.........the Taste is unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Once again, my boss was nice enough to treat us all to lunch. He picked Aiello's and I decided on just green pepper pizza. Simple enough.   I have to be honest, but I truly don't understand the hoopla about this place. It's not awful, but it's not really anything to rave about either. Maybe it was because by the time my coworker brought back the food my pizza wasn't that warm, but I just wasn't too impressed. After having a few pieces, I decided it may be the dough/crust. It didn't seem done. Not only was it mushy and falling apart (along with the cheese and sauce), but the flour still left on it was waaaaay too much for me. I had flour all over my face and hands. I'm usually a fan of mom and pop's pizza joints, but Aiello's didn't really cut it for me.   I'm giving this three stars because after microwaving a few pieces later on that night, it tasted better. I somehow preferred it microwaved? Hmm..."}
{"text":"Service friendly, price fair- however I have made and have tasted better."}
{"text":"Established in 1978.  Rated number one pizza in PGH.  Sat under signed Aiello's tshirts by #32 Franco Harris and #38 Curtis Martin. *sigh*  Seats approximately  40 comfortably.  Watch them make pies from streetside.  Has 2 TVs.  Pizza's are hearty and tastes great!"}
{"text":"Honestly? It tasted weird. I was visiting extended family and we bought two pizzas--1/2 veggie/meat and one cheese. The sauce was too sweet and the veggies were not at all what I expected. Now, Mineo's...better pizza."}
{"text":"a must have for the pizza lover, the fact that next door is another one of the greatest pizza shops in the city is a testament to how good this pizza really is ."}
{"text":"Aiello's vs Mineos. Aiello's is not bad. Don't think it's as good as people make it out to be.  Had 2 pepperoni slices. Didn't re-heat all that well. The staff is super super friendly. Very welcoming place. Very much a great neighborhood spot. If I lived close to hear I would be back more often."}
{"text":"Really people? 4-5 stars for this? Having lived in NYC for the last 8 years, I can tell you that while the ingredients for pizza were present, the food that I put in my mouth last night was not, in fact, pizza.   First, the crust was so mushy that when I lifted my slice it actually fell apart! Forget not holding firm for me to bite it, the main part of the slice actually separated from the crust.  Then there was the bland cheese and watered down sauce. If I didn't know better, I would have called this a congealed and tasteless soup.  Bleh!"}
{"text":"It's better than Mineos. There is no contest. It's just better.  There's less grease, less cheese (Mineo's has half an inch), more sauce. It's a personal preference - if you like cheese go to Mineos, if you like a perfect ratio then go to Aiellos. They put their toppings under the cheese, and it makes perfect sense!! I never knew the genius of it but it works, trust me."}
{"text":"I was from out of town and ate here on a friend's recommendation. Great pizza! Better than anything I've had in Philly, and up there with the best in Jersey. Truly excellent and as a bonus it's cheap too."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Pittsburgh.  Great NY Style pizza as well as excellent pepperoni rolls  A bit pricey, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Better than Mineo's.  Mineo's has a good pie, but it only stays in business with two other better pizza joints on the same block because of its reputation.  Skip both Minoe's and Aiello's and go to Napoli."}
{"text":"Okay, here's the thing . . .   Aiellos is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. I'm telling you . . . It is the best. Yes, I have had Mineos. It doesn't compare. I wouldn't care if the inside of this pizza shop looked like a prison (side note: it kinda does right now because it is undergoing a major remodel) because the pizza is THAT good.   I have been going to Aiellos consistently for years. It was love at first bite. They even back their pizza up with a: you-don't-like-it-you-don't-pay-for-it guarantee.   I bet it has never had to be honored.   On a practical and helpful level, here are a couple things you should know:  1. It's cash only   2. You pay after you order AND eat (hence guarantee)   3. You grab your own drink(s) from the cooler and pay for it/them after   4. A true measure of a pizza is its ability to stand on its own as a regular cheese pizza. Order that. (BUT my friends also swear by the white with feta)   5. You can park for free on side streets like Douglas (where I always park) up the street a bit (because there are some pay spots closer to Murray)  This pizza is worth you going out of your way to experience. AND it might not be far fetched to say the pizza SHOP wouldn't be worth your time to go out of your way to experience too once the remodel is complete. Aiellos pizza originated in 1978 with a recipe straight from Italy. I hope that recipe is locked in a gold chest somewhere.   It's that precious."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Pittsburgh.  Period.    Way better than its neighbor which will remain unnamed.  Aiello's is great.  The food is excellent, the staff is great and every time I go, I leave knowing that I will definitely  return.  Try it, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm from Michigan and I've been eating a ton of sweet food and wanted a quick slice of pizza.  Brought my 2 kids with me and they were already full from the other places we ate at and I ordered one slice and the gentleman asked them if they were gonna get a slice and I told him they ate already.  Sat down to wait a for my slice and the men came out and brought my slice along with a slice cut in 2 for my kids to share.  So unexpected and appreciated.   I would highly recommend this place.  Pizza was amazing and fresh."}
{"text":"The environment is pleasant and the staff is fast and kind. Their white pizza is delightful and so are the pepperoni rolls! If you're looking for a quick bite to eat and are in the neighborhood. I recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"The only place in town that can hold a candle to a raised in South Hills, Fiori's stuffed gal for pizza. I have walked miles to this place. I have taken lyfts from bars in South Side to this place (with the original idea probably being to go home in East Lib, but some dreams do come true). It's all worth it. I'm not even getting into the Mineo's garbage here because that's what it is. Don't even start.  First of all, you pay when you leave. Second, if you don't like slightly sweet pizza sauce or those crust bubbles, get out now.  Crust bubbles made here make the world a little brighter.  I typically split a large black olive with a girlfriend.  A few specs of grease and sweet tomato sauce are always all that survives. Good to note this is also the only spot for pizza that I dine in. The Formica covered booths tucked together by the pop can machines are the cutest. Coupled with some friendly fellow pizza patrons, you're going to make some friends.  More importantly, you're going to have the best pizza in the city. I said it."}
{"text":"The people that work here are very friendly, they have late hours, the food is awesome, I never like Italian hoagies but someone told me to try theirs and it is my favorite lunch in squirrel hill now.  They are expanding and made the store bigger and added a bar, which is exciting."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!  We went here after a horribly disappointing meal at Dels.  I needed Pizza and I needed good pizza!!!  This place did not let down at all! The staff was friendly and very personable.  They directed us to their favorite pizza and helped us to make a good choice.  I got their margarita pizza and later found out that the owner picks the ingredients daily to make this pizza so it's nice and fresh from the garden.  My partner got the stuffed pizza and we were worried that it might be to filling but it was just right.  The top was crunchy and had a nice sprinkle of cheese and the meat filling wasn't jam packed with meat but had just the right amount.  The crust was nice and thin and had a good crisp to it.    I can't wait to go back here again, to bad they aren't down the street from our apartment.  But I think that if it was we would be the size of a house and the only exercise I would get would be walking to the store to pick up my pizza.    A MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"Well, being from the South Side of Pittsburgh you always talk about Fiori's being great and hear about Aiello's being The Best from those folks east of the Burgh. So today, I thought I'd check them out and see what's up.  It was around noon on a Sunday and fairly empty. I walked right in, ordered and started chatting with Mike, the owners son. Good guy, I can relate, being the son of a restaurant owner. It's funny to hear someone else tell the same stories, ha. He fixed me up with 2 slices of pepperoni and a pepperoni roll. The pepperoni roll was BOMB, so good, I loved the little bit of burnt cheese around the edges, so yummy. The slices were great, too. Thin, New York style and a few shakers of goodness-crushed peppers, parmesean cheese, etc.  The place was really clean, lots of seating in the back and plenty to drink. Beer or Soda available.  The big question: Are they better than Fiori's? Well, they are neck and neck in all honesty. I like that Fiori's is a little sweeter, but both pies are great. The pepperoni roll will bring me back for sure.  Oh, and open til 2am!"}
{"text":"The people that work here are awesome!!! Tried it for the first time tonight at 1:40 am Saturday night, ordered two slices and waited 10 min but our pizza was no where in sight :( I walked up to the counter to check on our pizza and that's when they realized they forgot about our pizza and it was burning! No biggie, they put in three slices in the oven right away and we got our pizza within a few minutes. When I asked for 2 cups of water, they started pouring some Brita filtered water into cups but ran out so he just have me a bottle of water instead! We went up to pay after devouring our pizza (which were delicious!!) and they told us not to worry about it because we waited too long! That was sooooooooo soooooo nice and generous of them!!!  Will def return, this made our night!!! Honestly awesome people, awesome food! What more can u ask for ?! We love u Aiello's !!"}
{"text":"With the remodel complete, Aiello's has been transformed into a bright and cheery pizza shop! I love that they added a bar so you can more easily enjoy a beer with their pizza. Just remember, that it's cash only, though they do have an ATM on site!"}
{"text":"What an awesome restaurant!! And the place only gets better every time I visit!!  So contemporary, bright, and they now have a bar!  Highly recommend this restaurant!!   Plus, owners and employees are super super nice!!!"}
{"text":"Obviously the best.  Except for the times that the pizza isn't cooked quite enough (roughly 1 out every 15 visits?). But then it makes really good leftovers."}
{"text":"The pepperoni rolls are to die for. Absolutely delicious and the garlic butter was fantastic! We also got the Giuseppe's Margherita, and my goodness...everything about this was wonderful. The cheese was buttery and creamy and the crust was perfectly crispy on the outside and was wonderfully fluffy inside. Highly recommend this and would definitely say this is the best pizza in all of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Best hoagies ever. Best salads ever. LOVE this spot and go daily when I'm in the 'Burgh!"}
{"text":"Holy cow its baaaaaaaD. Sugary tomato sauce, cheese is like aged American cheese. Crust under salted. Wow, 4 stars? And...... They were rude. We were told by locals not to go there but to some other place near by. However, yelp have it 4 stars. So we made that brutal mistake of trusting yelp."}
{"text":"Good food, pretty standard. Italian sub was delicious, pizza was average. Difficult to find parking and the people are not personable... But you don't get take out for the people right? I would go back"}
{"text":"Best pizza around! Better then minneos! The white pizza is to die for. The red is just as good and the sauce is the bomb! Not over cheesed or sauced just right. Also found another gem in their stuffed pizza! BEST PIZZA IN PITTSBURGH!"}
{"text":"As far as take out pizza in the Pittsburgh goes Aiello's is the best.   If you like NY style pizza this is your kind of place.  Not sure what else to say."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the 'Burgh, hands down. Accept no substitutes, especially if it's right down the street.  This is the place for perfect pie with slightly sweet sauce... dough that's thin yet doughy, abd the perfect amount of cheese and toppings."}
{"text":"I love this place. I would say this is my pizza joint - everyone's gotta find their pizza joint, you know? Now if I can just get them to say \"the usual?\" when I visit... haha.   The crust is really nice here, crispy and chewy, and the sausage is one of the best. We usually get pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.   It tastes better fresh out of the oven there of course, but takeout is great too. I've had the tiramisu as well (I don't think they make that though) which is tasty too."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. Staff is super rude. Waited 30 minutes for 2 pizzas. Got charged 30 bucks for a \"gourmet\" pizza, basically just a $18 regular pie with some $12 basil thrown on top.  Ok beer selection. Inattentive bartender. Not kid friendly, which is impressive for a pizza place.  Mineos is better."}
{"text":"A few evenings ago we came to Squirrel Hill for Chinese food; I fell in love with a pizza.   On-street parking in Squirrel Hill is problematic regardless of where you go, but after driving around for a bit, we settled in front of a pizza parlor. A stout, squatty, greying, long-haired gentleman with a patriotic bandana wrapped around his head sat on a stoop. Looking like a retired pro wrestler, he seemed out of place in a neighborhood such as Squirrel Hill. Then again, so did Kay and I, which may have been why he reached out to us. Had we found a kindred spirit/guardian angel?   \"Hey, they've been out ticketin' even at this hour,\" he amicably, helpfully hollered over to us as we left our car in front of a parking meter. So feed the meter we did after we made some small talk with this man, finding out he lived in Penn Hills of all areas. It wasn't until we got into Ka Mei down the street that I realized that I just had a brush with a legend in Aiello's, a parlor with a pizza that often silences debates when cited.    Due to his act of kindness and the fact that Aiello's has a rather famous pizza, I found myself preoccupied during our Chinese meal at Ka Mei and dessert at Mineo's.  As we approached the car at the end of our date, I caught Aiello's neon sign in my sights again and felt drawn to it, so much so that I couldn't get in the car.  \"Kay, I just want one slice. I have to try it! I might as well. I mean, we're right here!\"  \"But you just ate!\" Kay was perturbed.  \"Yeah, but it was Chinese. You know how that goes. Besides, the guy was nice to us. I want to throw him a little business.\"  \"You're crazy,\" Kay declares. She got back in the car, and I headed into Aiello's.  I approached the counter and became Oliver Twist asking for more gruel.  \"I just wanna try your pizza. One slice. I hear so much about it, and I'm here y'know?\"  \"Plain?\" The streetwise guy we encountered earlier seemed self-assured, smirking as he took my order.  \"Yeah, that'll work! I can't wait!\"  \"You'll be back,\" he says with a grin, only to pull a whole pizza out from the oven to \"check\" on it, as if I didn't know it was a ruse; The Last Tempation of Darren W.   When I gazed at its skull-white crust and the deep, scarlet sauce that bubbled underneath the ivory cheese, I was entranced. A creature of terrible, bloody pulchritude was before me.   He put my slice on a plate, and I merrily took it back to the car, relishing it slowly as we headed to Beaver Falls. The crust was magnificently cracker-like. The sauce packed twang, punch, and luxuriance, complementing the subtle, milky cheese completely.   Kay's was green-eyed the whole way home, my heart having been stolen by a slice of pizza.  \"I hope you enjoyed your $2 whore!\"  \"But babe, it only cost $1.50.\""}
{"text":"Really awesome pizza. You can argue about the merits of other pizza shops, but the sauce on Aiello's is great, and I love the crust.  Bring cash, get take out and give it a try."}
{"text":"Nice greeting by the guy behind the counter.    One of my favorite pizza places but do not get here often.  Love the Aiello T-shirts on the wall autographed by a few sport celebrities including some Green Bay Packers.    Nice crust, flat pizza not NY style and not Chicago style.  The crust was nice and crisp and crunched when eaten, very enjoyable.  The sauce was very good and had a little more spice than many places, oregano?  Topped with thins spicy pepperoni which was good.  The cheese was good but a little greasy."}
{"text":"I'm not from this area, so I was unbiased in the great Aiello's -v- Mineo's pizza war that takes place in these parts. I tried both, and while both are good, my clear favorite is Aiello's.  For traditional pizza, I recommend an 'off the top' pie. It's deliciousness cannot be explained. It's warm meltiness will soothe what ails ya!  But my all-time go to our is the white. I love a good margarita pizza, so we ordered one here. It was delicious, as expected, but tipped the scales at about $30. Unable to handle the sticker shock, I spent a few minutes looking over the menu before out next visit. If you order a white pizza with stewed tomatoes as a topping, it'll cost you about $10 less! Then we top with fresh basil from the garden and there you have it! So flavorful, and it'll reheat nicely in a toaster oven, but is still good cold, which is the true pizza test."}
{"text":"Good pie.  In a side by side comparison with Mineos, it comes in a close second.  However they are nothing alike.  The sauce is heavier, obvious of a good (great) quality tomato.  There is also a mystery spice in there...they wouldn't tell me.  Marjoram?  Thyme?  The cheese drier, more mozzarella and maybe little to no provolone.  Pepperoni rolls were good. Subtle in flavor, very nice crust.  White pizza was excellent.  Not over garlicky, same great crust."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, has a family atmosphere and you can tell this place has been here for quite sometime. I went here with my husband and his family for a post moving dinner, and it was not bad at all. Their system for drinks was interesting, but it worked. They have vending machines for some sodas and if you want a beer you just ask for it and pay for the ones you had at the end.   The pizza was rather tasty. Love their crust, it was nice and crispy and their sauce was not too spicy, so I was a fan of that. Their large and medium pizzas are enormous so you definetely get your moneys worth.   In terms of ambiance, the place is a bit old, there are booths on the back and you bus your own table when you are done. The Parmesan and the red pepper flakes tend to sit on a counter so if someone is using it, you have to ask for it. Their walls are covered with autographs of local celebrities, which is kinda cool and will keep you entertained seeing who visited the place.   Overall I really liked their pizza, customer, service and ambiance. I would def come back."}
{"text":"Aiello's offers up pizza with a high quality crust and just the right topping/crust balance. I've been quite pleased with both their red and white pies. You can even pick up some dough of your own to bake a similar pie at home.  I'm also fairly impressed by the salad. I'm not going to hide the fact that the lettuce component is entirely iceberg, but with plenty of toppings to round out even the most basic salad I certainly can't complain. The lettuce was fresh, the tomatoes were above-average, and a nice dash of pizza seasoning over the top adds a pleasing body to the mix.  For all the gory details, I posted a review over on FoodBurgh... http://www.foodburgh.com/2009/09/review-aiellos-pizza/ I highly recommend stopping by to give them a try."}
{"text":"I stumbled in here by accident.  I missed the door to my favorite Squirrel Hill pizza joint by a couple doors.  Boy, am I glad I did.  My pizza pie here was awesome.  And the people that work here are great.  John tried to talk me out of that darn pineapple, but no way!  I told him a wanted a piece in every night.  He delivered.  The sauce is mighty fine and John was very generous with it.  The cheese completely buried all my topping.  Delicious.  And don't get me started on that crust.  It was nice and soft and had a lot of body.  No greasy pizza here.  Michael was like a mad man with the pizza cutter.  I think there was some pent up aggression going on there.  I love this place.  I couldn't eat this pizza fast enough to take in all the great flavor.  Yum yum yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"I've been to Aiello's at least 1000+ since I was 4 and I am only 23. I am convinced it is the best pizza...and not just in Pittsburgh. I have lived in New Haven which is known for their pizza including Pepe's and Sally's. I've lived in NYC with legendary Joe's and Lombardi's. I have searched far and wide in my quest for best pizza but alas I have discovered that the best pizza shop pizza is (fortunately) in my hometown. Order well done extra crispy small pizza with extra sauce and extra cheese. No pizza is better. Period.   As far as pizza rankings in Pittsburgh, mine are as follows:  1. Aiello's  2. Beto's (with baked cheese)  3. Della Sala's (extra cheese) 4. Slice on Broadway (original)  5. Cucina Bella  Mineo's fell off a cliff...Aiello's now is how Mineos used to taste in its glory days."}
{"text":"I used to go down the street for Mineo's - but that was before I stopped in at Aiello's.  Try the white pizza - probably the best I've ever had (your experience may differ)."}
{"text":"Beer and pizza make me happy.  Aiello's decor is bright and clean - inviting you to come in and I like how all of their cooking and baking is done in front of the customer. We ordered a small Hawaiian and grabbed some beers. The small is more than enough for two people. Aiello's puts on ample toppings - this one had pineapple, ham and bacon. What was most notable to me was that the crust was crisp which was absolutely delicious especially with a few air bubbles. Even after sitting for a couple of minutes, the middle of the pie held up and did not get soggy. Also some of the bacon had some crunchiness and wasn't buried in cheese. Major points for me.  The staff were friendly and laid back however Aiello's is cash only. They have an ATM in the store.   I'll be back but not before trying Mineo's."}
{"text":"Their breadsticks are fluffy, crispy, garlicky, buttery, and just straight up amazing. The elasticity and crust to inside ratio is perfect.  Kinda pricey for raised dough and sauce. But their pizza is no surprise. It's the same Pittsburgh pizza as all the other pizzerias on the block. Super disappointing what with all the famous pizzas, I mean, people on the wall.  Still, I'm a fan purely for the breadsticks and the nice people who work there."}
{"text":"Tried to stop by for quick late snack but the order of 3 plain slices took forever to come out."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! But the pizza is awesome and I always stop here for a couple slices if I'm carrying cash. Staff are very friendly. My go to is definitely their white pizza."}
{"text":"Oh my. One of my lifelong favorite pizza shops. I often review places late. I think to myself, \"you've been coming here all of your life and you've not reviewed it?\" Well, now I am. I love love love the pizza here. It's definitely in my top five. I'm a simple gal and a pizza with double cheese does the job for me. My only complaint is that they don't deliver. I mean they never have but jeez a girl can dream can't she?"}
{"text":"Aiello's is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh, though if you prefer thicker cheese you might prefer their certain competitor (you know who). For me, the Aiello's formula, which is a bit lighter but still filling, is ideal.   Warning though: the service can be ok or can be a bit on the rude side depending on with whom you interact."}
{"text":"Squirrel Hill classic!!!   It really is excellent pizza and the sauce is so perfect! The dining area isn't anything to write home about - but the pizza is, so its all balanced!"}
{"text":"My pick of the seemingly dozens of pizza shops in Squirrel Hill. Not as greasy as its rival, Mineo's, down the street. I usually just get slices, but their Farmer's Pizza (with mashed potatoes and corn) is definitely worth trying. A good place for a quick lunch, and it's open late, too!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing about the perfect consistency of Aiello's crust for THREE YEARS before I got to try it for myself.  That's a lot of build up for pizza.  LUCKILY, Aiello's is completely deserving of that much build-up.  It is absolutely delicious.  I begged to go there every single night for the week I was in Pittsburgh, and mostly was obliged.  (Aiello's is open late--2am, so it's the perfect place to go not only for lunch or a casual dinner, but also late night--especially after some tasty PA beer is in my belly).  The staff couldn't be more nice.  Everyone goes out of their way to meet you, know you, and provide a great pizza chomping atmosphere.  This is one of the few places in the world where ordering plain cheese is amazingly delicious and satisfying.  Order it \"off the top\" for a slice heated to perfection, but not too steamy...believe me, if you get it too hot, you will burn your mouth after not being able to wait for it to cool to taste your slice.  It's going to drive me crazy not being able to have Aiello's all the time.  I guess I have to plan more trips to Pittsburgh.  PS: Crazy inexpensive (!!!) CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"With the plethora of pizza parlors 'round town, it's challenging to really differentiate one's self, but Aiello's has been representing since 1978. If it's a late night slice fresh off your beer scooter or a full on pie bonanza...dine-in or take-out, Aiello's prides itself on quality and consistency without breaking the bank. Their sauce leans slightly towards the sweet side with a sound cheese 'n crust game to bring it all together in perfect proportions. And bonus, they are expanding 'n at! Yinzers rejoice!"}
{"text":"Absolutely hands down my favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh. The abundance of a slightly sweet and well-seasoned sauce, in addition to thin and crispy crust sets Aiello's apart from its competitors. It's so good I get half-baked pies and bring them home to freeze until I feel like a pizza night. That's right- I would transport across the state because it was that good! The restaurant is simple and the place is cash only- don't forget to go to the ATM before!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this pizza for so long so I finally made my way to check it out, and it did not disappoint. There is absolutely nothing fancy about this restaurant but well worth the trip for the quality of pizza and the friendly staff. The person behind the counter was super nice and asked us a lot of questions, like how we heard of the place and where we were from etc. It definitely felt like we stumbled into a hometown pizza spot. The old school booths and tables in the back had parmesan cheese on them and strangers were just passing them around as needed.   At one table there was a bunch of teenagers and at another there was large group of what looked like businessmen after work. The crowd was diverse, but you could tell everyone just came for the pizza goodness. I enjoy pizza with a slightly sweet sauce and the right amount of cheese that doesn't make it covered in hard mounds of cheese ... and this pizza met both criteria. Right up my ally!   Another plus is that they have multiple coolers of drinks including different beers and ciders. We just picked what we wanted and paid at the end for what pizza and drinks we consumed. I loved the laid back, trusting vibe of the staff and customers. If you are looking for a pristine, classy place, then I wouldn't choose Aiellos. But if you are interested in hometown, good pizza by the slice or pie, then I'd recommend it!   I'll definitely be back to order a whole pie next time!"}
{"text":"Passionate dislike. $18.75 for a medium, cheese, onion, and mushroom pizza. The box is taped closed so you can't see the pizza until it's too late. Cash only annoyance.   Flavor is not included with the cost of the pizza. I used most of my Parmesan, red pepper, and oregano, just to salvage this traumatic experience. The center of the pizza molded into the wax paper forming a grotesque Stromboli of cold, tasteless toppings.   The mushrooms are genetically modified to only have the visual appearance of a 'mushroom'. On the only non-negative note, the crust around the perimeter was passable: firm, floury, not soggy or greasy.   In the center however, the crust had the structure of a wet paper towel. Under no circumstance would I recommend patronizing this place for pizza at the current prices."}
{"text":"Aiello's is definitely my favorite pizza place in pittsburgh so far!  The hawaiian was soooooooo good!  I wish they delivered!  It was pretty expensive for pizza though."}
