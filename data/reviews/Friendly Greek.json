{"text":"Not good, full stop.  The Greek salad had 2 thin slices of tomato, 2 olives, and the rest was iceberg lettuce. Pita was a sesame hotdog bun.  Not exaggerating.  I'm happy to pay more for actual food. \"Comes with French Fries\" should have been my first clue."}
{"text":"I ordered the pork souvlaki.  Pork was tough and tasted old.  The potatoes had no flavour and were disintegrating on the plate.  The side of vegetables was bland.  The \"pita\" was a hot dog bun and they give you a tablespoon of tzatziki.  The greek salad was only iceberg lettuce and a slice of tomato.  All of it was so depressing."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Greek restaurant on the Danforth. The atmosphere is dated, but the food is just delectable. The price is reasonable considering all the food you're getting and the wait staff are just so friendly, patient and kind. This place has a very homey mom & pop shop feel to it. Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the Friendly Greek is not the place to go if you're looking to have a special meal out.  However, if you just don't feel like cooking and are looking for some pretty good Greek food at a reasonable price it's perfect."}
{"text":"The food there is really good, it's not that expensive, the service is good and fast; I like grilled calamari and lemon potatoes. The Greek salad is good but I would say the seafood platter for 2 is one of the best.   I just love it! Prices are good, what else can u ask?!"}
{"text":"\"Friendly's,\" a Greektown staple, is THE place to for some cheap, decent Greek grub. It's a great, reliable place to go with a group of friends or the hubby for dinner. Never quite busy, yet never quite dead, The Friendly Greek offers all the typical Greek fare for fair prices. The servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Small portions , normal taste, good service, nothing so special about this place except for the size of the place, so huge! Little bit over priced."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. The meat was dry and the rice was tasteless.... Everything seemed to be pre packaged- defiantly not home made. Would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I must start off by saying that I used to really love this place. Nothing fancy, just straight to the point good old greek grub.   But the last 2 visits are sadly going to be my last. They changed the menu, I always get the same thing, small Gyros dinner with potatoes and rice, the classic way, no frills. But my last visit was horrible. The gyros meat was dry and flavorless, the tzatki sauce serving is much smaller than usual (that stuff is gold!) the rice was microwaved and the prices have gone up. I let my server know about the dried out meat and she went to speak with the kitchen and said that is was probably the end or edge of the meat hence why it was dried up. She apologized but did not offer to get me a new one or take it off the bill.   Again, very disappointing, I used to frequent this place quite often but the product and service have dwindled majorly and it makes me very sad.  I'll never forget the good times we had my old greek friend, but it is time for me to move on. I wish you all the best."}
{"text":"Yes, we are aware that Greek is not the best option for vegetarians, but while hanging out at Taste of Danforth, it was hard to find a place with a large group, so we ended up going there anyway.  So what we, vegetarian could order? That section offered: potatoes, rice...er...potatoes and rice together. Yes, please bring that on.  Maybe some salad, too? Yeah, all that starch tasted good, great flavours, but not very nutritional for us.   Did I mention, we got some bread and water too,. Our friends shared their calamari with us and we gave them extra potatoes, as it was plentiful, which  means that the portions are good. Servers did a really hard job, when they had been put to test the whole long festival day. Thank you for that.   If you are a meat-lover, this is the place for you :)"}
{"text":"The Big K, who uses a hockey analogy for almost everything, likens this restaurant to an old hockey player who just doesn't know when to retire:  the restaurants \"plays\" efficiently and tries hard to deliver but can't hide its age.  Food was standard and consistent: fresh Greek salad with generous serving of feta, moussaka and tender pork and beef souvlaki.  Decor is dated, tired and worn.   Although the restaurant was one quarter  full,  our party of four had the misfortune to be seated next to a table occupied by a dieting model and her date.   The model, in calorie conservation mode, took bites of her food and then spit them back onto her plate.  It was kind of a mood breaker and obviously not something that the restaurant had control over.  Other tables were occupied by families with impeccably behaved children who had passed Etiquette 101 and knew that dining out should be a delightful experience not only for yourself but for guests seated around you"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon The Friendly Greek late one Sunday night with my friend.  Our original intention was to eat at a Moroccan restaurant in the area, but they ran out of food so we wandered blindly for a while until we came across this place.  We thought it looked like a decent spot that would would serve big proportions... we were very hungry so this was a factor.  The decor is just average, although the upbeat Greek music adds a nice lightness to the place.  In general, it reminded me of a very large family friendly franchise.  Given this, I didn't have very high expectations when we entered the place.    I ordered the lamb souvlaki dinner and my friend ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner.  Both our dishes came with a greek salad which was big,  packed with feta cheese and good.  We were also served a basket of bread, which at first looked like toasted hamburger buns, but turned out to be yummy garlic bread.  My main came with two sides, rice and roasted potatoes.   I liked the lemony flavour in both.    When I finally tried my main, I was pleasantly surprised; I love lamb and am very picky about how it is prepared.  When I cut into my lamb chops I was very happy... so tender yet well done, the way I like it.  My friend's chicken souvlaki was also good.  All in all this was a satisfying experience.  If you are hungry and looking for wholesome Greek food, this place is not bad at all.  The staff are friendly and down to earth and the food is good."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio (small), inside seating as well with a massive open window. The wait staff is nice, I did ask for recommendation, it wasn't very helpful. The food is great! Big portions for the price. I was very happy with my order and I would go again."}
{"text":"I've always loved going to the Danforth. When I was a kid, it was either, Mr. greek or little hole in wall places. Been to the friendly greek multiple times. Actually enjoyed them more than mr Greek for a while. Tonight we find out they moved to a very tiny location across the street. It was pretty busy so we decided to have dinner. Walked in to find out its where demitries used to be. Waitress led us to the back where it was so cramped you could hear the next couples conversation and they were whispering. I asked if we could move over to the next table. She said that one was reserved. So we ordered the regular dinner with a side of plain feta. Our soda drinks were filled half glass each with too much ice. The 7-up tasted like the cheap version. I ordered potato and rice, she handed me a salad. Then out main course came. The roasted potatoes were almost mashed, chicken was burnt and the rice was soggy. You can clearly see the potatoes were boiled not roasted. Hubby ordered a souvlaki sand which with salad and fries. Fries were wet and soggy meat was dry. Waitress asked if everything was okay. I told yea, just okay though. I excused myself to the bathroom. Downstairs bathrooms were clean but only to find they have another kitchen down there next to the bathroom doors! Yuck. When I went back up hubby was telling her it was the worst experience at the danforth yet. She said our was our first complain ever. I find that hard to believe. She wanted to give us free dessert. I told her the bill and we left as quick as we could. Honestly, I have never had a bad exp like I did there. Save yourself the trouble and go to Astoria or papas grill!"}
{"text":"Great place. You can see the food being prepared in front of you if you like (kitchen is sort of open and see through). The food is great and the portions are generous. The saganaki i excellent, and the servers are very professional.   Fast service, Good food, generous portions, nice patio in the summer, and friendly servers.  Could use a bit of improvement in the interior design and music department.  Great place to dine overall."}
{"text":"It is very difficult to find a good grilled calamari.  This place serves very good grilled calamari.  I enjoyed it very much and I will come back here for it.  Everything else seemed fine but nothing outstanding.  The rice, potatoes and salad that came with my dinner was quite bland and a bit watery.  The service was fine and they were pleasing.  But the cavernous space made me a bit sad.  There seems to be triple the seats than any other restaurant along the Danforth but they do not even come close to filling the space.   If I want calamari I will come here but for anything else I might have to think twice about before coming here."}
{"text":"Standard casual greek food.  We had dinner for four last night and the service was prompt and the food was good.  I had the seafood platter and the portion size was generous enough to have lunch for today.  Maybe a bit heavy on the oil - but that could just be greek food?  Also the only beer on tap was flat - so maybe grab a bottle.  Other than that - it was a great patio and a nice dinner."}
{"text":"One of the biggest let downs I've experienced in a restaurant. After having to send back my plate twice for it not being cooked to my order the manager then still wanted me to pay for my full meal!  Not to mention throwing a fit in front of the whole place. Did I mention we were also there to celebrate my mothers birthday? Which the staff was aware of?   Extreme disappointment!"}
{"text":"I gotta say, while there is no shortage of higher-end offerings on the Danforth, this place is really fantastic if you are hungry, have a kid in tow and just want to sit down and eat some home cooking.   The staff are either used to or love kids and treat them the way they would treat eating and paying customers.   It has a typical Greek food menu (souvlaki, rice, potatoes, steamed veggies, Greek salad) and a few \"Canadian food\" offerings, like hamburgers (?).   My absolute favourite part is that they toast up a hot dog bun, butter it in garlic butter, slice it up and serve it while you're looking at the menu. There's a nostalgia in that for me that's really comforting.   They also feature the old school \"desserts in a glass case\" which I love.   We've been many times and we'll be back. The pricing is great, the atmosphere is laid back and they treat you and your kids like gold. The food may not be fancy, but they've got their customer service down like nobody's business and sometimes that's all that counts."}
{"text":"We loved it. We had the spinach pie. I had the Greek beeftikia sandwich. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here for a drink and read my book on their patio.  This place has a patio twice the size of most places on the Danforth, so be sure to check here if you really need to sit on a patio.  The menu seemed to have a large selection but I just had a glass of some Greek wine.    The service was better than average my servers were all cheerful and made sure to check in often enough to see if I needed anything.  The washrooms were clean and fresh smelling and the inside had a nice rustic feel to it."}
{"text":"Used to be a 5 but quality has definitely suffered over the last 10 years and owner changes. Don't think we'll hurry back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My Big Fat Greek Lunch at The Friendly Greek was delicious and HUGE. Sure, the menu called it a \"light lunch,\" but the giant salad and hefty serving of gyros on pita had me stuffed 'till well past dinnertime.   Of course, don't miss the saganaki. Cheese + fire + brandy = awesome. My gyros were delicious, though a bit on the dry side. Veggies on my salad were nice and fresh. Service was nice and speedy, and being on the patio on a warm summer day was great for lunchtime people-watching. Best yet: reasonable prices.  Opa!"}
{"text":"Had the Lamb enough times for me to keep going back, was recommended this place by a friend and he didn't disappoint it is absolutely delicioud"}
{"text":"What? 5 stars? Lol I was a little surprised to say the least that Yelpers would give any chain restaurant a 4.5 star rating....  Don't be fooled, it is a chain restaurant that serves up chain food. My standards have been set by Pantheon which is our family's absolute favorite and we've been loyal customers for years.   Anyways, here you will receive, a standard greek salad, dry chicken souvlaki, a lot of rice, and some floury potatoes....it tastes pretty good, but why fill up on this when there are much more delicious and authentic offerings."}
{"text":"It's good. It's authentic. I had grilled octopus, which was very tasty, but portion was small. Kalamari was very good, an other dishes that family had were also very good. I would say the food is very good, prepared well, authentic. THe price was a little high for the portions and while the food was really good, not anything really \"special\" and therefore the price didn't justify it. I would likely go back, but not before trying other places first - looking for that one that really does something special. We were in the new location, which was a very tight fit. All the tables are on top of each other. No outside seating. It wasn't crowded, but I can imagine if it was it would be very loud and hard to hear each other. The wait staff was very nice and helpful. Picky teens also found items on the menu that suited them. Overall, very good. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Edit: 2018 they moved and changed their tzatziki   4.5 stars.   I think this is my favourite Greek restaurant in the city. I have had many fun nights, dates, even a birthday party here. The salad and tzatziki are my favourite that I have tried in the whole city. The ambience is nice, the souvlaki is great [i prefer the chicken], the side dishes besides the salad are pretty basic. I get rice and potatoes with my dinner [which also comes with bread and salad--you get a lot of food for 12 bucks] Their rice is good, their potatoes are as well, but they're not my favourite, just because ive gotten accustomed to their sauce. If you order Greek fries, decline the sauce if you want traditional greek fries as the \"sauce\" they offer is the sameas they put on the rice and potatoes. Service is excellent here. Everything is reasonably priced. Treat yourself to the saganaki opa while you're there-another strong suit. I love this place.   In summary: -Best salad. Yuuuuuum, both the Greek and the classic village -Best tzatziki -Great meat -Decent side dishes [though if you opt for the vegetables or fries, they're the basic restaurant fare.] -Get the saganaki at least once in your lifetime -Great service, they're always refilling your water and checking on you [this sounds basic but its a pet peeve of mine when im sitting with an empty water glass forever] -Excellent prices for LOTS of food, especially if you get the souvlaki dinner. Though the pork souvlaki dinner gives you more meat, I find the chicken to be tastier and more tender. The platters are also very good. I had some tasty quail. =]  Its also never very busy there. The only reason I didnt put 5 stars was just because their sides [the veggies, fries, potatoes] are normal."}
{"text":"Ugh.....my favourite restaurant on the Danforth was a huge disappointment tonight. 4 of us stopped in on Thursday night at 6:30 for dinner. Unbeknownst to us, there was a World Cup game going on which featured Greece...so the place was packed...so a nominal 10 minute wait for a table was not an issue. Once seated, we ordered fairly quickly as it appeared as they wanted us in and out quickly so they could turn over the table. This is where things went downhill. Our meal, which was ordered at 6:50pm...didn't arrive until after 8:15pm. Our waitress popped by on several occasions telling us that there was a mix up in the kitchen and our order was \"screwed up\". The first time she came by to tell us this was at around 7:30.....and yet it still took over 45 minutes for our food to come out. When it did come out, everyone's meal was lukewarm except mine...it was cold. (I ordered the Gemista, which is a stuffed tomato and a stuffed green pepper). It was so cold that I had to flag down the waitress to send it back. This is only the 2nd time I've ever had to do this in a restaurant. When it came back out, it was only marginally warmed.....so I ate what I could and left the remainder on my plate. Our waitress apologized again for the poor meal....but when the bill came there was no adjustment for me having to send my meal back or not finishng it. Because of this lack of customer service, I will never step foot in this restaurant again, nor recommend it to others. Too bad...as it was one of my favourites."}
{"text":"Fulfills expectations. Great long serving staff, good Greek food, and a family atmosphere.  Been coming here with my kids for ages, one of our traditions. Highly recommend it against its neighborhood competition."}
{"text":"Its definitely our go to. We usually come in late nights and if schedules permit during the summer  in the day enjoy patio weather. It is small, but it is cozy. We order the same things all the time - pork sticks, calarmari, fries (well done). We don't usually eat alot so these things just hit the spot.   We come in and the waiter usually knows what we order which is great! (Yes we come in that much) Very accommodating when my boyfriend likes to add all the different condiments (extras mayo + garlic butter on the side for the bread) The owners are very nice and ALWAYS great us when we are in.   I highly recommend this place for fast, delicious food. Thank you for you consistent amazing service. See you soon"}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to Greek place on the Danforth.   Not because the food is the best, but the food is decent, portions are reasonable and it's cheaper than most of the other options in the area.  They have a fairly large patio which is great in the summer. Yes, so do most of the other Greek restaurants in the area, but Friendly Greek has one of the larger patios around and finding a table is usually do-able.  I normally just stick to the basics and get a chicken or pork souvlaki dinner here, which runs around $12.99 or so. Considering you get a huge greek salad, bread, potatoes and rice with two huge skewers of meat, it's a fab deal but there's no WOW factor.  Decor is kind of cheesy in a good way. Lots of wall murals depicting traditional Greek scenery.  Service is always fast and friendly.  Friendly Greek is more family oriented or a place to bring kids, rather than an ideal spot for fine dining or a romantic meal. (For that, go to Ouzeri or Pan nearby)"}
{"text":"The Friendly Greek may be a huge chain, but I've never had a bad experience at one of their locations. Despite being surrounded by other Greek restaurants who sell exactly the same food, this location thrives and survives, because their food is just as good as most places, and better than some.  Basically the Friendly Greek covers your basics of Greek Restaurant 101 -- souvlaki meals in two sizes, with rice and potatoes, delicious breaded deep-fried calamari, the cheese on fire (you know, OPA!), yummy baklava, and the like. The best part is that everything is super tasty and they bring you free garlic bread."}
{"text":"Yuck!  Tried to give The Friendly Greek a try  on take out ... tossed it after I pulled at least 3 hairs out of my food and saw that the chicken was still pink.   Never again."}
{"text":"Friends from out of town love this place, so while their kids were at a concert at the Danforth Music Hall, we thought, let's go for greek food. We walked down to their original location only to be greeted with \"For Lease\" signs and a placard listing the new location...so off we went to find it.   The new location must be 1/10 the size of the original location. It is very small and lacks the comfort factor of the older location. We ended up seated at the back...it was dark, and we felt tightly pushed together.  With this move they've also downsized their menu options...several signature dishes are gone (I used to love the Gemista, but it was cut from the menu). Anyways, one of our group ordered the octopus and she said it was amongst the best she's ever had. My chicken souvlaki was a tad overcooked (dried out) and the rice was pretty flavourless..the portion size of the potatoes was way too much.   The food we ordered was good, we just felt confined in the small space and we missed the street views the older location provided (it was very airy).  Our waitress was fantastic...efficient, funny and attentive and the food on average with other places I visit.   The problem I have with the new location is that it doesn't feel unique anymore, so whereas in the past we would seek this place out, we most likely won't in the future."}
{"text":"Works for me - flaming cheese, pork n fries plus a carafe of drinkable wine ... I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good Greek food.  Good souvlaki and gyros.  Good but a bit heavy."}
{"text":"The restaurant styled like a Greek taverna is one of those old school Danforth mainstays. It is a large cozy place with glass windows opening on a small street-side patio. The perfect place to spend an evening soaking up the festive atmosphere of the Danforth. There is always more than enough food for anyone as everything arrives in copious amounts. They have a good selection of mezes, including a nice assortment of dips, fried and grilled appetizers. All of their mains come with a Greek salad, and a plate of rice and potatoes making for large meals. We had mountains of food and everyone came away with their bellies stuffed."}
{"text":"Far from Friendly or tasty! The worst service, the macho waiter thinks he's auditioning for a movie instead of listening, taking orders and delivering the meal ordered! We asked for less rice and more salad he said fine and that's not what we received. The meat was tough and over priced! The chef said waiter never asked for more salad because they don't make any substitutes. So it's not friendly and nothing worse than being misled at those high prices for a tiny assembly line eatery when there are so many better restaurants on Danforth! Will never go back under any circumstance!"}
