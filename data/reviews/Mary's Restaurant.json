{"text":"I gave this dive two chances for redemption. And the food is way over priced, paid $24 for a lunch special and a coffee. The refried beans where purreed in a blender. The rice was undercooked. The sandwich had way too much condiments, lot of bread and little lunch meat.  The coffee was cheap instant coffee. Honestly folks I would have been better off going to the grocery store and purchasing the items for a club sandwich with a 2 litter soda."}
{"text":"Wow!  These are the hidden gem restaurants we all hope to find!!  Great homemade food, clean, awesome service, and such pride in their small family restaurant."}
{"text":"Honestly I think this is the best kept secret in Phoenix. I'm sorry but this hood is rough, but Mary's is is no short of a diamond in the rough. I'm sure I sound like a family member or something but I am really just a fat boy that likes good food and works near by. The pupusas are amazing, green chili burro is top notch and if you are in the mood for breakfast try the chilaquilas. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"You can tell the cook with love. The best Pupusas I have ever had and I've been eating them for 20 years! The bomb!!! (The tamale's masa was too thick for me but that's my personal opinion.) Definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"We happened upon this little hole in the wall when out shopping for granite.  It's a family owned and run business and the service was excellent.  We ordered a few of the Salvadorian appetizers and they were excellent.  We especially loved the pupusas.   This is not fast food...one cook in the back and it took a while to get our food as there were a few groups ahead of us.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! I ordered a sandwich and it was all bread very little chicken and lots of mayo. Wishing I would have taken a picture. I don't eat bread so I left very hungry. They serve no veggies at this place. My son and his friend had a burrito they liked but the salsa was very watery. Nothing was outstanding especially the price! I paid almost $20 for my meal and my son's, it is very over priced. Not worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Small Mom and Pop restaurant. Friendly service and great food at a good price."}
{"text":"Gorgeous food crafted with care. We always get a bean & cheese burrito because if the beans aren't great, the rest of the plate suffers. The beans are great. The recommended papusas were fresh and bright with a great combination of both dough and the salty pork, beans and cheese filling. The place feels as if it's all made with love and passion ... and the best beans in Phoenix. I hope to return soon, with friends and family."}
{"text":"When in an ethnic restaurant, order ethnic food. The pupusas where a new food to me  and good. The tamales were exceptional. And the banana bread."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! PUPUSAS!! You need to get them here. So goooood! Very clean and affordable. Family owned. Highly recommended"}
