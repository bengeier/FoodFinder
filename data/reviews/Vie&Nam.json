{"text":"Great portion for the grilled meat dish, with coleslaw and salad. I ordered double vie which come with 3 slices beef and 2 large pieces of chicken. They are both so tasty and sooo juicy. Love this. You have to try the pho when you go to a Vietnamese place. Of cause we ordered the dac biet(mixed rare beef and beef flank), we end up getting another one with spicy sate sauce on the side, it add a bit garlic and spicy flavor. This is our go-to place every time we go shopping in eaton center, they have many special promotion coming for summer, like taco banh mi(a twist & mix with Vietnamese sandwich), also coconut summer drink. After all, great fast food choice in eaton center!"}
{"text":"Best grilled pork chop in town. It is tender and sweet, you can see the lemongrass in the sauce. Also ordered mini soup, perfect size for some beef broth and noodles. They also recommend the famous banh mi sandwich, will come back for more!"}
{"text":"This place is located in the food court of the Eaton Centre.   I was looking for a \"fast-food\" yet healthy lunch. I decided to explore the food court of the Eaton Centre.   This place is in the far back, between another South-East Asian restaurant and an Indian place. The line was quite long, I think it took around 10 minutes for me to place my order. I ordered the grilled pork chops with lemongrass vermicelli and veggies. The rest of their menu consists of grilled pork/beef/etc with rice, some sandwiches and a soup.   I expected to have one tiny pork chop with lots of fat on it. I was wrong. I got two pork chops with little fat. There was one problem though: the pork chops weren't cut, which were little difficult to eat with chopsticks, even if I'm quite good at it. I finally got a fork and knife and cut them in pieces.   The plate was huge, mostly of vermicelli. I never tasted the lemongrass. The pork was good and the sauce was delicious. Price: $9,50, no drink included.   Conclusion: Will probably go back when I crave the pork."}
{"text":"Delicious meats and friendly service. The vegetables might be tastier, but the grilled combos, especially the beef, are delicious!"}
