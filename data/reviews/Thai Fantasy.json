{"text":"A favourite among locals!  I've come here a number of times with friends and solo - they've never made an error on any order, which seems to be rare but definitely  understandable in the restaurant business. Most people order take out so there is always a spot inside if you prefer to stay and chat.  This is bias, but my utmost favourite dish is the green curry. It's just spicy enough and the flavours closely match real green curry found in Thailand. Close enough compared to other pricier Thai restaurants in Toronto( and none of the crowd)! The coconut milk greatly conpliments the complexity of the chilis that the dish is made with. Rice is never overcooked, but this splendid little number is hardly ordered on its own.  If you go with friends you can have more variety! I would highly recommend the spicy peanut chicken, and if you have enough people to eat with, please order the house pad thai. They don't skimp on any ingredients, and we all know how important peanuts are to a lot of these dishes!   When you factor in no wait time, price point,amazing service with the SUPER friendly owner, and bang on dishes there is no way I could give this less than a 5!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and loved it. Want to come again. Place is nice and clean, with beautiful ambiance. Menu is simple and straightforward! I had ordered green curry and every dish there will come with spring roll, salad, soup and rice. Our server was nice and courteous and took care of all our needs. It was really good quantity for the price we paid. I would definitely recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Good meal. Lots of flavour in the lemon grass. My fiend said her pad Thai was good but needed more spice and flavour. Updated decore and food service."}
{"text":"I love this place! Highly recommend the Bangkok Pad Thai & the Thai Dumplings   Service is always great too"}
{"text":"Very average.  I read the reviews on Yelp and had high hopes & expectations for Thai Fantasy but it is anything but...The food is average tasting; if you've been to Thailand you will be disappointed. The server taking my order warned me that the green curry was spicy.  It was anything & everything but spicy.  It was fatty tasting, vegetables weren't cooked enough, overall devoid of that that Thai zing.  Portions are on the smaller side.  I think it's bit too expensive for what it is.  I have had better at that price range.  Wouldn't go back, not even for take out.  Spend a couple of extra bucks, pay for the take-out and go to Sukhothai on Parliament, which I think is still the most authentic and best Thai restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"A very pleasant surprise. Got here a little early for lunch (11:30) and I was the only one in the place. That changed fast as many came in who had made reservations. Clean, bright, good decor. Service was fantastic (getting the bill took a little time). Had the pad Thai lunch special which in clouded corn soup and a spring roll. Soup was delicious and had just the right amount of spice. Pad thai was cooked perfectly, just sticky enough and also good level of spice. The spring roll was probably the biggest surprise. It was light and not oily at all. Price was very inexpensive. A great lunch."}
{"text":"Review for delivery only: I haven't been to the restaurant but I have had delivery twice. Fantastic service over the phone and by the delivery driver. Food has tasted great each time and the portion sizes are good compared to other Thai restaurants. This is now by go to place for Thai Delivery."}
{"text":"Très bon resto. Le service est excellent et m'endroit est d'une propreté irréprochable. Le curry vert était très bon. Il n'y avait pas de salade de papaye sur le menu ce qui selon moi est inacceptable pour tout resto thailandais qui se veut authentique. À essayer si vous passez près mais si vous devez vous déplacer, opter pour un autre (Pai ou Nana par exemple)."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The papaya salad was super fresh and crunchy and I also loved the flavour and texture of the beef pad thai.  I asked for less spicy and to make it less salty and it was perfect for me :)"}
{"text":"It was raining and I was craving for Thai food. Thought the review are above average, so I made my choice to try it out.  The staff was friendly and very attentive consider he took care of all the occupancy by himself during lunch time. There were around 6 tables at that time.  The food was nice, I had green curry from the lunch menu and it comes with salad on the side and a spring roll.  Will try others dish on next visit."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 dishes from justeat with a promocode to save 20%. They delivered the food pretty quick.   We got the red curry chicken, shrimp fried rice, and pad thai.  Food was alright overall. I dont think it would have been worth it had it not been for the discount.  It was not the worst nor the best thai food out there."}
{"text":"We had the garlic shrimp, the spicy peanut chicken, and pineapple salad. All three items were distinct & so tasty. The greens & fruit were super fresh & the shrimp & chicken were cooked just right (the spicy peanut chicken sauce is wildly delicious). This is my new standard Thai restaurant for sure."}
{"text":"Thai Fantasy is absolutely the best Thai restauranr in Toronto. If you have never been to this place, you gotta come give it a try!! The Bankok pad thai and golden curry rice are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Thai Fantasy?  Thai bad dream more like it. Sold out of steam dumplings. What's ip wirh that? Mediocre Pad Thai. Expected Masaman curry and contained Indian curry ;pretty efing weird!! Friendly waiter but place was bizarro.  Rather expensive esp. for what you get. Too bad Spring-roll,on Yonge closed, that was excellent!"}
{"text":"Pros: Absolutely immaculate dining room, friendly staff, decent variety of foods, soup was very reasonably priced, pad see ew was tasty, good portion sizes, nice plates.  Cons: Sort of slow service (food took a long time to come out), they didn't write down our orders and royally messed it up (thankfully my bf isn't allergic to shellfish bc that's what they gave him instead of chicken in his spicy-soup-that-was-supposed-to-be-made-mild) then gave us lame excuses, noodles seemed a little pricy for just being noodles."}
{"text":"Visit here for lunch. They have lunch special,  choose a main course, comes with spring roll, salad and soup. Have beef pad Thai, it is ok in my opinion, not big amount considering price($11 include tax)."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy noodles at Thai Fantasy and they were delicious, and they aren't kidding about the spice! Overall, although the flavour of the dish packed a punch, it could have used more vegetables (it was mainly noodles). Additionally, the price of around $11 was a bit steep in my opinion for the portion size.   I would rate Thai Fantasy a 3.5 stars based off the spicy noodle dish taste and price. However, I would definitely return to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"Thai Fantasy is a great spot to grab lunch. They have a selection of lunch specials that come with soup.  I had the basil chicken which was a decent portion for lunch.   This place takes reservations and it was good for a work lunch for 10 people.  The service was quick and we were happy with our meals."}
{"text":"Our apps were the Indian samosa and the hot and sour soup. The soup was brought 7min before the samosa, although both tasted good.  The mains were mediocre at best. My rice noodles were completely over cooked and mushy (gross!)."}
{"text":"I've came here for lunch several times and it gets the job done.  Affordable, decent portions and good selection.  Food is good (I usually get pad Thai or vegetarian green curry with rice), but don't expect the authentic Thai taste.  I find it a bit \"westernized\"  to try to appease the general crowd or 9-5ers who come here for a quick bite.  Restaurant decor/atmosphere is modern and pretty clean - and service is quick and usually friendly (I've had a server who didn't even greet me but just set the table and brought over food).  Would come back, but don't crave it and won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Got take out from here. We got golden curry and red curry both vegetarian.   The food was really good. Super delicious and made so well. Authentic Thai flavors and right amount of spice in each dish. The portion size was big. It was made quickly and the customer service was super nice.   They accommodated our dietary needs. Enjoyed the food a lot and definitely recommend this restaurant for everyone. Will be coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Price?7/10 (10 means really expensive)  Service: 10/10 -Price?7/10 (10 means really expensive)  Food: 8.5/10 -lamp curry: 9. Tastes really great. -house phai Thai: 8.   Food amount: 7.5/10 (10 means a lot) -lamp curry: 6.5 -house phai Thai: 8.5  Environment: 8/10 Simple, bright and clean. Able to have a lot customers."}
{"text":"Decent price for lunch, after tax comes to $10.11 on the spot if you get their lunch special. The portions are average with soup, spring roll, and salad included. Although I would have rather opted for a drink if the option was there versus the salad. The salad was a spring mix, completely different taste to \"Thai\". I would have given their overall quality of \"Thai\" food a 3 star as it is a step above \"Thai Express\" but as mentioned by previous reviewers it is not authentic Thai. But 4 stars for their excellent service! They offered me a glass of water and a seat while I waited for my take out. I would come back again to try other items because of the service."}
{"text":"Service is great! All waiters and waitresses were friendly, we ordered shrimp paste friend rice and green curry, the wait wasn't long and the taste was great! The portion is big. I would recommend sharing because that gives you more options to try. If your around he neighbourhood and looking for a quick bite I would  recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have picked up takeout lunch from here twice and both times merited at least four stars. The pad thai appeared fairly generic at first, but what set it above many others was how moist and soft and delicious the plump bits of chicken were. A refreshing contrast from the thin, hard, and dry chicken typically found in pad thai.  A few weeks later I was ready to venture further down the lunch menu and, sticking with the chicken, got golden chicken curry. Once again the chicken was most, soft and delicious. The curry was good but unremarkable. The accompanying spring roll was cold and unremarkable. The hot and sour soup was tasty but lacking any veggies (mushrooms please!) beyond a couple of thin strips of bamboo shoots.  Four stars for that chicken."}
{"text":"ordered chicken pad Thai and golden curry chicken. both are good. personally I like the pad Thai cause the noodle is so good. lovely priced lunch."}
{"text":"THERE WERE MAGGOTS ON OUR TABLE!  Went there with 7 other people on a Friday.  After I informed one of the servers of the the larvae discovery and after they wiped them down the floor, there were NO follow-ups done by any of the staffs; NO explanation how this could've happened (I have a feeling they were coming from their AC!); NO offer of a discount on our bill. Definitely NOT going back there!"}
{"text":"New Thai Fantasy popped up on Yonge street downtown core and no, IT'S NOT a massage parlor with happy endings!  The restaurant is clean with tables along the sides and down the center. Ordered the Khao Soi, very tasty but slightly on the sweet side. The creamy red curry was spiced just right. I'll have to ask for not so sweet next time. Reasonably priced and good service. Looking forward to my next visit and try their Pad See Eww."}
{"text":"I've been getting take out here for the past couple of months.  Love the Chicken in Peanut Sauce and Vegetable Green Curry - only dishes I've ordered - but ready to branch out and try something different on my next visit.  Food is ready for pickup within 10-15 minutes and staff are very friendly.  Reasonable prices and good portion sizes."}
{"text":"I had their green curry, it is pretty similar to authentic thai food. I was pretty surprised to find the food to be so good at such a cheap price (around $11.5)"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is fantastic. I like mine a little on the sweeter side so I requested it that way and it was perfection. My colleague and I really enjoyed this restaurant while in Toronto on business recently. The service is excellent and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been in constant search of good Thai restaurants for a while now since I moved to Toronto from Vancouver for my studies and this has got to be one of my top favourite Thai places by far.  I don't want to make this a long review so I'll make this quick. As a half Thai myself, this is obviously not the most authentic thai cuisine place I've seen. However, every bite of the food I ordered from here is like a flavour bomb. Absolutely worth it for the price.  Not to mention, the employees are very kind and attentive. The owner, too, is extremely friendly and approachable. When I enter the place to pick up my takeout orders, I usually see the owner having fun conversations with customers. It really livens up the place and I love it. Sad to say that it's hard to find people like that nowadays.   Overall, I highly recommend this place for both takeouts and dining in."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to order off the lunch menu but was disappointed that the staff was not as accommodating as in other Thai restaurants in the city when I requested no fish/oyster sauce and the soup without eggs, and salad with a vegetarian friendly dressing. In fact the waitress seemed confused with this request which I found surprising. Every other Thai restaurant I've been to in Toronto easily makes and understands this request - it's quite common considering many vegetarians frequent Thai restaurants. My recommendation is to offer at least one or two options on the lunch menu that are completely vegetarian friendly and train the staff to know that it's actually not uncommon for (vegetarian) customers to ask for no fish/oyster sauce. I did end up ordering off of the regular menu (Golden Curry) and it was fantastic. I would definitely go back again and try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"My experience with Thai fantasy is via just-eat. We ordered purely based on the excellent reviews on both sites, and I have to say we were both pleasantly amazed with the food. We both ordered the Bangkok pad Thai and Thai samosas (yup Thai samosas, why not! Glad we did). The pad Thai was really, really good, the more I ate the more I loved it, it had a ton of flavour, and it was perfectly tuned. I absolutely devoured my pad Thai,  just loved it. The Thai samosas were excellent as well, very tasty!! I even have to compliment the delivery guy, he was super nice, and the food was delivered in a flash. I'm honestly looking forward to ordering again. I hope their other dishes are as great as the Bangkok pad Thai was!  Edit: My second experience with them was just as good or better, the red curry pad thai is nuts, love this place!!! freakin excellent food!!"}
{"text":"I came here last night and my friend and I had a really good experience. The waitress continued to refill our water glasses at an okay rate and the food was delicious.   I ordered the chicken green curry and was really happy with how it tasted. It was both gluten and dairy free. I was starving having just been at the gym but I think I would have enjoyed it no matter what.  The prices were really good and my meal was really filling. The owners also let us stay in the restaurant until they closed. We arrived around 7pm and left around 11pm. We just enjoyed the space and kept chatting.   My friend also really enjoyed her dish. She ordered the Pad Thai and thought it was really good.   I would definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Only ever gotten takeout, which may be why I've always experienced that the noodles are a bit bland. Everything else is pretty standard food-wise.   Service is always pretty friendly, and the interior of the restaurant is pretty. Never had any crazy issues with this place."}
{"text":"Red curry with pineapple and chicken...fantastic. Spice scale is for Canada not Thailand ...which is fine with me I can't handle full on Thai spicy but I am sure if I asked for it they would do it. Bangkok pad Thai good, peanuts on top but not in sauce. Prices very reasonable and service is quick and gracious. Five stars"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Large bright space, clean, good food, friendly service and very affordable.   I went for lunch and got the chicken peanut curry lunch special which came with soup, salad and a spring roll. The hot n sour soup was good, spicier than expected, which I liked but some of my dining companions didn't - so be warned. The meal was very large for a lunch meal and plated nicely. The peanut curry was both spicy and creamy and had great flavour.   Service was very quick over the lunch hour and the staff were friendly. The whole meal came to $11 which was a steal for both the quantity and quality.   Came with a group of 6 and there were no issues. Would recommend for small and large groups alike!"}
{"text":"The chicken fried rice is my favourite. And the owner or manager is one of the nicest servers I've ever encountered in my life. Like really nice. And the restaurant is well lit and looks clean. I like it. Makes me happy."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ordered the chicken Pad Thai. You could have also requested it with beef or veggies. The Pad Thai was made with tamarind sauce, bean sprouts, cilantro, green peppers, egg, and some green onion. I was also given spicy fish sauce, my favourite. But their fish sauce was much thicker than I normally have it but I found that it was easier to dip the chicken into as it coated the surface area. #math It also came with hot and sour soup, a vegetarian spring roll, and a salad with a light dressing.  The food was good in my opinion. It came out hot and all the flavours were great. I love how the crushed peanuts added even more texture to the dish. The portion was excellent for its price. However, for the noodles, I would have liked it more if there was more tamarind sauce for a stronger taste. The spring roll was very crispy and hot. I can tell they prepare all their food fresh!  The service here was great. The servers consistently refilled our drinks and were on top of the game even though there were only two servers and a store filled with hungry customers. So props to them. I would suggest more servers to achieve even better service! Still, I'm coming back! :D"}
{"text":"Delicious. Every time I go to Thai Fantasy I order their papaya salad, calimari and green curry.   Staff are super friendly and service is always fast."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! We were walking on Yonge and decided to give it a try. Such a pleasant surprise. Our server was very kind and the food was delicious! We had the mango salad, Tom Yum soup, Pad Thai and the green curry. The mango salad was so good and refreshing. Pad Thai and Tom yum were both very good. The green curry, however, was the highlight of the night - absolutely incredible. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff are super nice. Amazing green curry, Bangkok pad Thai, spicy peanut chicken. Go for their lunch special - cheap & you get soup, spring roll, salad, and a main dish! Lots of tables, clean. It can get busy during lunch hours so if you're picking up definitely call ahead."}
{"text":"I have a special category for these places.. it's not that it's \"inauthentic\" but that it has it's own kind of category: \"Asian influenced protein with sweet/spicy sauce on rice\".  Thai/pan asian seems to be that name for it these days.  Don't come here expecting Sukho Thai, or Pai, or Sabai Sabai and you'll be in a much better place.  This is also not \"fake chinese\" or I prefer calling it North American interpretation of Chinese food.  (There's an American Chinese restaurant in Bejing and fun overhearing the local go nuts wondering what Americans have done with Chinese food.)  ANYWAYS..  This place is about 2 weeks old at the time I'm writing this, and there's plenty of potential for this place to grow and my rating is more based on that than the one time I've been here.  I'll give it a few more go before I update my review.  But so far, it's a decent deal for decent food.  Good luck Thai Fantasy."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend both had stomach upset for the rest of our days after having this for lunch. Omg........"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a few friends. I never went here because the store front was not too inviting but I'm really glad I did, because this is my new go-to thai spot. It's a hidden gem. We got the lemongrass fried rice, house pad thai and green curry. They were all delicious! The pad thai was light and tasty, and the curry was very creamy and flavorful. Nothing was overly greasy or salty. The service was really nice and the manager seems like a genuinely kind person! he is always smiling lol  the price is also great. I've been to Pai and sabai sabai multiple times and trust me their green curry tastes the exact same as what we had at thai fantasy, except its around 50% more expensive. this place is not overpriced and serves great food, the service is also much faster. I'd recommend this over pai or sabai sabai any day because I feel like it's better food at a better price point."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and honestly, I find that this is one of the better Thai food places in this area (Salad King is beyond this area). There are many Thai places, but either I find the flavour profile to be off or the service to be less than mediocre. This place has been a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. The food is average prices, which is good, and tastes incredible. I've tried a few dishes and they have been great. Even next day as leftovers! The service is always friendly and timely. I'm looking forward to more visits as the months get cooler!"}
{"text":"Came here for take out the other day and got the house pad thai and the peanut chicken. Food was pretty bland and lacking any sort of taste. Service was friendly, but our order took about 25-30 minutes to come through. Don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Quick and cheap. The guy will also promise you free meals if you go often enough and he likes you."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with my nephews. The server was extremely friendly, and proactively got us extra napkins/etc. when he noticed we were running out of them. We ordered the pad thai, shrimp paste fried rice, yellow curry, khao soi, and a few other dishes I can't remember off the top of my head. They all tasted great, and I would definitely come back here again. It is also quite spacious inside, which is rare for a restaurant along Yonge in this area."}
{"text":"I visited this place after a few friends recommended it to me last year.    Service: 5/5.  The owner or manager (always well dressed, fairly young) is amazingly nice.  He's smiling and just really friendly.  Also, the last time I was there, and it was fairly busy, I swear, if our water was 3/4 full, they'd still fill it up.   Also, everything is customizable.    Ambiance: 3.5/5 - It's pretty basic but clean.  Quite spacious too.    Food:  4/5 The first time I came here I ordered basil fried rice.  Very good flavours and tasted pretty authentic.  The second time I ordered the golden curry pad thai (excluding egg).  I asked for it mild, and it was not spicy at all.  It was a bit of a sweet flavour, strong hint of coconut and blended very well.  I should have asked it for at least medium spicy, but that's my bad.    Verdict: Will be back."}
{"text":"Impressed with their Bangkok pad thai (chicken). I had the lunch special which comes with your choice of soup (hot and sour, or cream of mushroom), a salad (spring mix - nothing special), and a spring roll. All for $8.95 before taxes!! The pieces of chicken were moist, and the overall flavour of the dish was on point. They don't skimp on the crushed peanuts either :) My friend had the spicy peanut chicken, which is served with white rice, and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing. Haven't had Thai food this good since I was in Thailand. The green curry was very creamy & rich (coconut cream?). The Phad See Ewe was a great combination of sweet & spicy. Best of all was the mango salad - perfectly ripe mango, fresh cut, with an abundance of peanuts. Like dessert to start dinner. New favourite and we'll be back - often!"}
{"text":"I can't say the food here was terrible, but I can't say that it was good either. We ordered the vegetable green curry and the spicy noodles and both dishes fell short of our expectations. The green curry was too sweet and the spicy noodles were not spicy at all. I asked for extra hot sauce and it still wasn't very spicy.. It was just very salty and I'm still gulping down water half an hour after finishing my meal. They were very generous with their portion size for the noodles, but that doesn't add much value if the taste isn't there. The vegetable curry on the other hand had a whopping total of 4 pieces of tofu.   The service was also painstakingly slow. There were only 5 tables seated when we arrived, all of which had already been served, and it took about 15-20 minutes for us to get our food.   I really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately I do not think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai Resto, my new favourite in the Yonge and Wellesley area.   We dined in. They served water right away, a tell-tale sign of a good experience to come!   The Tom Yum was made with the freshest vegetables. Spice levels were high and we loved it.   Similar story for Chicken green curry. The Kao Soi was different than I've had before- rather than served with noodles it was served with taro fries. It was incredible.   Will be back here again."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Great reviews and friendly staff but food didn't meet our experience with Thai. Pad Thai really zero flavor and even though I ordered chicken, there was Tofu also like it was leftover. Everything was just ok. Clean place though but first clue should have been not a lot of people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"5/5 service... But 3/5 food and 1/5 venue. The male servers were all so polite, professional, and eager to help. However, the food was very mediocre at best and I didn't like how much oil, salt, and sugar was added to every dish unnecessarily, e.g. the green papaya-lychee salad contained palm sugar and was waaay too sweet :(   Portion-size wise Thai Fantasy did not disappoint; although a few of my friends said Thai on Yonge has better portion sizes (and food).   I ordered the Tom Yum Soup, which I would not get again as the whole thing was like drinking oil. Also, vegetarians beware! There are 2 options for soups, either chicken/vegetables or shrimp (extra $). Chicken/vegetables means that the soup contains both vegetables AND chickens. So you must tell the server that you are vegetarian!  The venue was kind of ratchet and there weren't a lot of customers all night... There won't be a next time for me unfortunately as if I'm ever craving Thai food in the area again I'll be going to Asian Bowl (the best!), Salad King, or Thai on Yonge."}
{"text":"Highly recommended.. food is so good.. people here are nice..very good service.. good portion..place is clean.. we had shrimp roll and curry.. golden,red and green.. all curry's are yummy..next time im gonna post some pics.."}
{"text":"The best Thai food you can get in Toronto. Eat in and take out. Always impressive. The basil sauce fish and fried rice is amazing"}
{"text":"Superb place! Have been coming here for over a year and they have never disappointed.  The staff are extremely friendly, attentive, and create an incredibly welcoming environment.  On top of that, the food is delicious and fits any mood you can be in. Some of my favourites are the Bangkok Pad Thai, Spicy Peanut Chicken, Dumplings, and Green Curry!  Thai Fantasy is definitely my Yonge St. go-to. They're extremely quick, friendly, and have delicious food! What more could you wish for!"}
{"text":"Solid thai place! More of a 3.5 but loss of stars from experience. I have tried this place twice.   For my first time, I went with a friend and found portions to be very generous and filling. Service  prompt and quick. Interior a bit simple and no frills but clean. I enjoyed the food a lot and thought prices are reasonable. I like the pad thai chicken and golden curry which has coconut milk, potatoes and peanuts.  For my second time and reason for loss of stars, I ordered takeout through an app the restaurant uses called \"Just Eat\". It was a horrible experience and I would not recommend it to anyone. I don't know why the restaurant is using it and if you click their site, for menu or anything it goes to Just Eat.   If you need takeout and delivery, I would just call the restaurant and order on your own. When I ordered my food through the app, it took like 1.5 to 2 hours to deliver. Insane cause I was probably 15-20 walk away. I would have gone to get it but we ordered a lot and had people coming over. I called them to check what was happening cause people were still waiting and apprently the app did not send out order till 40 mins after I ordered.. it was a mess. Never again will I order using app, if I do takeout I will call directly. Food when arrived was good though, we ordered a variety of dishes from fried rice, tom yum soup to pad thai and curry. All really quite yummy. Please note though, they sadly do not sell thai ice tea.   If not for my last experience, I would give more stars. Overall, would recommend and return. Just no online ordering. Lol."}
{"text":"Thai Fantasy is a Thai-Canadian restaurant on Yonge street, offering Canadian take-out style Thai food in a seated setting.  The restaurant is not accessible and bathrooms are gendered.  The menu offers most meals with a chicken/beef/vegetables options, but if you're vegan, I would imagine cross-contamination is a concern.    I went for lunch with a group from work.  The service was quick and friendly.  The menu offered about 10 options for 10$ for lunch.  The meals themselves were good!  They came with a daily soup, a salad, rice, a main and a spring roll.    The soup of the day was hot and sour, which was good, but not great.  The salad was made with actual greens and not iceberg, which I REALLY enjoyed.  I would have preferred a larger main, but that's not to say it wasn't delicious.  In fact, it was sooo delicious, I wish there was more."}
{"text":"Offers exceptional service and well cooked curry. Suggest u to go with golden curry, it is on the mild side for anyone prefer non spicy option. Service again is highly professional, you can see they value their clients highly even when u walkin in late hours"}
{"text":"It is definitely not Thai food. It seems to be Chinese food :(. If you want to try Thai food, go to another restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised at how highly rated this restaurant is. It's definitely not an authentic Thai restaurant and their food is average. Service was top notch though!  I stopped by on the way home to get Pad Thai for takeout. Their Pad Thai was ok.. but could use more spices. It really wasn't anything special. My friend ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice and said it was average also.   I've heard good things about their curry, which I will definitely be trying out the next time I'm here. Perhaps for a dine in.  BIGGGG plus on their service. The managers greeted me right away as I stepped in the door. They're very friendly people and even brought me water while I was waiting for my food (takeout)."}
{"text":"Sooo good! You definitely won't be disappointed!  Food: My favourite is their general tao chicken And their hot and sour soup - literally one of the best I have tasted!   Cost: $-$$ definitely good bang for your buck if you go during lunch when they have their specials  Restaraunt: Not too big, usually always packed at lunch  So if you are going in a group maybe make a reservation  Also very clean with nice decor  Service: Super friendly staff. They also do delivery!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem!   10/10 service, food, and atmosphere. The staff are so welcoming and kind from the moment you enter the room.   To start you must try the dumplings!!! They are just phenomenal.  I had the Pad Thai which was great, I love my dishes a little sweet so this was perfect.   Thanks for the amazing meal!  We will be back."}
{"text":"The food here was boring and service was bad.  I ordered to-go and waited 25 minutes for this. The restaurant was fairly empty and quiet. The portion for the pad thai was fairly small. It wasn't good tasting either, they had large pieces of green peppers and other vegetables. It was not spicy or flavoured.  Also, the combo is said to be \"served with a soup, salad and spring roll\". I didn't get the soup or salad, I asked them and they did not give it to me apparently it's \"weekday lunch special\" only. The menu doesn't indicate that. I was not informed when I ordered, paid and asked about the daily soup.  I won't be back.  Note: Whenever I give out a 1-star review, I always bring it up the issue to the restaurant so they can amend it first."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Almost every time I come, I've ordered their Thai green curry chicken. That's because they curry is better than most Thai restaurant I've been to. It is rich and flavorful and green curry because I like my curry spicy. I haven't tried most of other items on their menu, but they all look good from what my friends ordered. I will try them out next time."}
{"text":"I went here with a couple of friends yesterday, and ordered a tom kha soup with the meal. They presented this bowl of mess with curdled milk. When we addressed it with the server. She seemed surprised to see the bowl of soup in this condition and her suggestion was to stir the bowl. After we explained to her the milk was not only just curds in our bowl but was continuing to separate as we were talking. We asked if we could have the soup redone. Our server did not have confidence in the cook that it would be done the way it is suppose to and recommended that we didn't reorder it and suggested a different soup.  Obviously being turned off by this we decided not to order a replacement soup. We ask to take the soup off the order altogether. Our server then explained to us that she would remove the soup from our order and change it with the Tom yum soup for free because we didn't get the order we asked. We got our tom yum soup, which by the thick layer of oil separating in our bowl we could tell was rushed. We also received a near flavorless basil pad Thai shortly after.  By this point we had given up on any indication that we were going to have a flavourful good quality meal. When our bill arrived it was delivered by a different server. we noticed that not only were we charged for the soup, we were charged for the more expensive tom kha that we didn't even eat because of the bad milk.  We explained the situation to this new server who went back to talk to the original server, and then to their manager.  Who tried to tell us no such agreement has been made. Speaking for his server using his own words he told us that the server ment that she would exchange our tom kha soup with the Tom yum soup at no EXTRA cost. As a consumer this made absolutely no sense since the Tom kha is $2 more expensive than the Tom yum soup. As we were going to eliminate the soup from our meal altogether because it was served with bad milk. Why would it make any sense to pay $2 more for the soup we didn't want in the first place. Throughout this whole ordeal not ONE apology was given for any of the inconvienence of sub-par quality food and service. Save yourself the $  the headache and potential food poisoning and go to the \"McDonald's\" of Thai food and go to Thai express instead."}
{"text":"Been here twice and enjoyed my meal both times.  They got plenty of seats and getting a table is easy even for large groups.  Food isn't fancy but the flavours are good.  Prices are comparable to Salad King and portions are similar.   I have brought friends here and they have all enjoyed it.  They also have lunch specials with many options to choose from.  Will definitely be back when I have cravings for Thai food."}
{"text":"Recommend: Thai dumplings (steamed with spicy peanut sauce), golden curry and house pad Thai :) Great service. One thing: need to renovate the washroom - stairs are dangerous."}
{"text":"I ordered from Thai Fantasy off of Just Eat. Spicy noodles and vegetable spring rolls. The delivery was on time to my hotel and the deliverer was super friendly and said he hoped I enjoyed it. I've ordered from Seamless and never has a delivery person been so friendly. The food was delivered steaming hot and fresh and it was delicious!!! This is really some of the better Thai food I had but to deliver it as if it just came out of the kitchen is a feat! Excellent job and hopefully they consistently deliver as I will be ordering again!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the work week. They have lunch specials for $10. Got the golden curry and my friend she got the green curry. It comes with a soup, spring roll, salad and rice. Both the golden curry and green curry are really good. The service was really good, very friendly people. Not much of a decor. Good price for good food."}
{"text":"I went pass this place and decided to try it. It turned out to be a great decision. The taste of the curry was perfect, and the beef was very tender. Overall a great place with friendly staffs!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls are well packed with choice ingredients. The chicken pad Thai is moist and noodles are just perfect not sticking together too much. Flavour is tasty and squeezing lime only accentuates the spice potential in the sauce. Pad Thai is meant to have a complex taste of ingredients as it does as many places overdo the sauce and it can often contain too much sugar. The peanuts, green onions are cilantro give the dish a fresh crunch which would otherwise be normally just a few bean sprouts in some places. Overall this place is authentic and reasonable."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! Best Thai in the city according to 4 foodies! Ordered delivery fast fresh and HOT even the delivery man was super friendly and personable great service and fantastic food!! TRY IT!"}
{"text":"This is a truly excellent Thai restaurant -- perhaps my favourite in the city.  I recommend three dishes in particular: the Thai green curry, the Thai dumplings and the mango salad. The person who co-runs it, Ryan, is very friendly. I remember he used to run a similar Thai restaurant across the street called Papaya. I was a regular there, but it closed around the time the LCBO in that building expanded. I am excited they have returned, this time with a bigger space and, as I discovered tonight when I tried Thai Fantasy for the first time, the same great menu and superb dishes. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"A 3.5 stars! To start, there's many good aspects about this place. Their lunch combos are a steal (so AFFORDABLE) since they are less than $11, and it comes with a main of your choice, a soup, a spring roll and a side salad. I tried their chicken pad Thai lunch combo for only $8.95, and the portion was very generous! Another good point is their FRIENDLY SERVICE since the server always remembered to refill our water, asked about our allergies, and was very enthusiastic in explaining their menu to us.   Why isn't this review a 4 star? Food was pretty standard. I enjoyed their hot and sour soup, their salad and their spring roll... but the food didn't really jump out to me. Personally, I found their pad Thai a bit salty and more light on the flavouring.    All in all, would I come back? Probably since it's affordable and okay food."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here on a whim. We came to Canada for our three year anniversary because we wanted to go somewhere new and exciting. We're from Florida and where we live we have a ton of amazing Thai spots. We were at The Riddle Room at the time and after about two hours of board games and an escape room we were hungry! I searched Yelp for some food spots in the area. This establishment was literally 30 seconds from The Riddle Room and we haven't had any Thai since we've been here. Yelp advised that this was a \"hot and new\" location in Toronto so that sold us. Yelp did not steer us wrong. The decor is sleek, modern and very clean. Was only three other tables seated when we got there and it's a fairly spacious restaurant. It started filling up by the time we were leaving and now we know why. The server was insanely kind, personable and attentive. I ordered the red chicken curry (comes with pineapple but you can substitute with veggies which I did) and my fiancé got the Bangkok PadThai. The plating was beautiful (I didn't get the best picture because I was too eager), each dish had the perfect amount of spice. The curry had an awesome texture and exploded with flavor. Not to mention it came out within 10 minutes. I couldn't finish it all at the time, but as soon as I got back to the hotel and set the bag down, I just busted the container right open again. Would move to Canada just for this place alone. I know this place is going to thrive."}
{"text":"I came with a friend on a Friday night, the location was easy to find but quite empty. The service is extremely well, the server was definitely above and beyond: constantly checked on you, explained the menu well, very accommodating. Based on service alone, this place is definitely 5 stars. I ordered the basil pad thai with beef, it was nice but not too memorable. Halfway through, I noticed I was given chicken instead of beef, but the chicken tasted good, so I didn't realize or bothered to have it changed.  I found the prices on the high end. The portions were generous, I would say it comfortably filled me with almost a half meal portion leftover."}
{"text":"We had the calamari for starters, the flavour was very nice with a hint of curry:) I found it to be too greasy and it wasn't crispy in the breading.  For mains, we had the basil pad thai, one with beef and one with vegetables. Both were very authentic, loved how much basil flavour was in the noodle:) The overall service was great, we were greeted right away and the waiter was very friendly.  Be careful of how spicy you ask for your dish, \"medium\" spicy was a lot spicier than I had expected!!"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and spacious which I liked but what bothered me was (you can skip this rant) a super strong fragrance, detergent, dish soap, floral scent that I had to keep inhaling during my stay which I did not appreciate. Smelled like someone knocked over a tank of soap.   Food review:   I ordered the red curry with chicken which was a coconut milk flavoured curry with pineapple and little bit of basil. Man, was I wrong about liking coconut milk and pineapple in curry. The first couple of bites were creamy and the aroma was amazing so I would say I enjoyed it at first but afterwards it was too much sweetness and creaminess for a dinner dish. There was lots of chicken, but the large slices of pineapple could have been cut into smaller pieces to absorb more curry and be less like eating fruit dipped in curry.   Thai samosa for appetizer was good! Hot and crispy on the outside, curry flavoured mashed potato with grounded chicken on the inside. Mmm! Only 2 pieces for almost $6 but they were pretty big.   Sharing the appetizer with my friend my total came to about $17 with tips. I would give this place a 3.5 stars overall on food but here's my generous 4 stars since the service was really good."}
{"text":"I have to give 5 stars based on service alone - the man who I believe was the manager or owner was so friendly and helpful, and all we did was pickup!  From what I saw the restaurant was beautiful and spacious. My boyfriend and I both ordered Pad Thai which was delicious. It was a bit different from what were used to in New York so I wouldn't say it was top status but certainly not bad! I'd love to try out entree items and appetizers on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Nothing amazing, okay food, good prices for lunch or dinner. I recommend doing take out as their sit in feels like a cafeteria, which is great for solo eaters :)"}
{"text":"A good Thai restaurant but not very Thailand. The Tom yam gong is not as good as I expected. The environment is pretty clean and nice. The service is fantastic. But there is no Thai decorations and the music is not exotic lol. Recommend the green curry! Really tasty and and the noodles are pretty good as well if you would like to try different things."}
{"text":"Love all the food and the staff. This is the same owner as Papaya restaurant which closed when the LCBO expanded over a year ago across the street. My husband and I missed it so much that when we found out this was the same place we ate here 3 times in two weeks. Ryan the one owner has the happiest personality EVER and we are so thankful to have them back in the neighbourhood. Their green curry, lamb curry, Bangkok pad Thai are soooo good!! We are so happy it is back!!"}
{"text":"Service is fantastic. Food is sublime. Hands down the best Thai Restaurant in the area."}
{"text":"Came here at around 12:30pm. First time here, they let customers sit anywhere they like. I got the golden curry with chicken (spicy) lunch deal, it came with rice, salad and a spring roll. At its price, it's really worth it! When the food first arrived, I found a strand of hair in the curry and I notified the waitress. She then replaced the curry for me right away (I wasn't complaining though), when it came out, it was really steaming hot. It was really good, I like the vegetable to meat ratio they gave me. The salad was interesting as it had a sweeter taste to it but I devoured it. It also came with a soup of the day (hot and sour soup) which is something I never had before but didn't dislike it. Would for sure come back to try their other cheap lunch deals! By the way, exceptional customer service!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Thai Fantasy about four times now, twice with family, once with friends and once for takeout - and each time the experience has been close to flawless!   The servers and staff are super friendly, ensuring that you're ordering the right amount for the number of people. They're also good with to-go orders, and the food is readied quickly - which is great considering how close I live.   As for the food, most of what I've tried has been tasty. I can only speak accurately about the Tom Yum soup because it's what I had most recently, and it was flavourful and spicy with plenty of shrimp. No complaints there!   Overall, a good Thai option in the neighbourhood. If I'm not trying new Thai places, I'll probably be going back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai place in the city!   The unassuming Yonge Street spot is consistent in providing delicious, filling food with attentive service.   We always order the pad Thai, green curry, and have tried the other curries and noodles as well. Everything always tastes incredibly fresh and is well seasoned. They even accommodate several dietary requests, such as omitting the fish sauce and eggs in the noodles to make it vegan. They're also knowledgeable about the gluten in their dishes, which is not common in the other Thai places I've been to.   I haven't been as satisfied with the delivery experiences, so I speak only to dining in. Great food, generous portion sizes, and consistent service! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is great and unlike most places in Toronto, their service is awesome  Basil sauce is very tasty, it's always a good option"}
{"text":"I've had pretty much everything on the menu, this is my go to place as I live near the neighborhood.   My top favorites are red curry pad Thai and Khao soi. The calamari is so delicious and chewy, like the ones you'd get in a night market. For chicken, I'd recommend the lemon grass chicken.   I wouldnt order the house pad Thai again, it was a bit burnt when I had it. Green curry with rice was a little on the sweeter side and hot.   Diane from Singapore"}
{"text":"Found this spot while wandering around hungry after 8 pm on a Thursday.  The interior is open and clean, though not fancy.  We started with the Tom Kah soup with shrimp.  It was delicious with just the right balance of richness, lemon grass and sweet.  The pad Thai was very tasty, though the noodles were just slightly overdone for my taste.  The Thai spicy seafood was very good.  Nice flavor and very fresh ingredients.  The calamari and shrimp were cooked perfectly - no rubbery seafood at this place!!  The prices are very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Great spot for Thai food. Service is great; our server was super enthusiastic, consistently checked up on us (maybe a bit too much LOL), and offered water refills. The restaurant itself is clean and spacious. Came here for dinner on a weekday and it doesn't seem busy at all. Definitely no concerns about waiting for seats.  In terms of food, I would recommend the Pineapple fried rice and Pad Thai. Nothing mind blowing but they're tasty dishes for sure! I was not too impressed with their khao soi, but this is a personal preference as I am generally not a fan of sweet curries. Since this was the first time ever trying a khao soi, I wasn't expecting the sweet coconuty heavy flavour. Next time I will just stick to the regular curries. We also got taro fries, which could have used more salt."}
{"text":"Do not walk into Thai Fantasy expecting authentic Thai. You will be thoroughly disappointed. Expect friendly service, belly warming food, attentive staff and genuine owner.   My companion and I shared two dishes - Green curry with chicken ($11.95) and Pad See Ew ($11.95). The food was delicious. Our bellies were content with the flavours and amount of food.   Overall, come by Thai Fantasy for inauthentic joy molecules inducing food."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a new Thai restaurant in the hood. I and my friends have a been avoiding this place because it looks so unwelcoming-the lighting is nuclear bright-you wonder if they're running a movie set or an operating room?!  We finally went the other night and dinner for two came to 33 bucks and it was good value.  I had a pad Thai and my friend had a curry, and we shared an appetizer.  The service was really friendly, the food came quickly, and it was good.  The usual spoilers for Thai like excess of grease, or being over or under spiced didn't seem to be a problem in our three dishes.  My friend ordered a green curry, and the yellow curry turned up instead-we said nothing because we didn't really care and thoroughly enjoyed it.  We did ask them to turn down the lights when we came in, and when they did so there were mutters of approval from the other diners.  Being nuclear bright it feels more like a cafeteria and strips the place of any sense of intimacy and privacy.  Hopefully they will get the atmosphere right, which really would be an easy fix-adjust the lighting and space a few tables.  We will definitely be back-in fact we're on our way now. I'm itching for a good curry!   Time for an update because I continue to return to this as a staple.  The host is Ryan. He is the consummate host! Last week we threw a surprise birthday party for a dear friend of mine at the restaurant. We dropped off decorations early which we planned on arriving to set up. When we got there early Ryan and his staff had already done a spectacular job of decorating a number of tables for us.  When are our  birthday girl arrived he treated her like the royalty she was! He presented her flowers and even bought a small gift for her.  I can't say enough about how we were treated and how much we enjoyed the night-which was not just because the food was spectacular, but Ryan and his staff went above and beyond to care for us."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for lunch with my friends. Ordered Basil sauce chicken. It was delicious! - they said it is mild but there's tiny bit of spiciness from sauce (garlic). I loved their plating and the fact that they used enough amount of heathy vegetables. As a person who studied nutrition, I also look at the nutrition fact in dishes. One suggestion is that I do hope they have different option of rice (white, brown or maybe mixed white and brown rice)  Service was excellent - the gentleman who served us consistently checked and filled the water, very polite and greeting people whoever visited (even to their delivery man). Price wise also thumbs up. They said no lunch menu for weekend anymore due to the raise on minimum wage, which is understandable. I would visit t again to try the other dishes, definitely!  One last thing is about washroom. The way to the washroom was a bit creepy but considering all of above facts and experience, this doesn't bother me at all."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, it has awesome value.  Cheap lunch options with good food.  Had the Bangkok Pad Thai everything about it was good.  The soup was underwhelming, but the salad dressing was real good."}
{"text":"I've tried items off their regular menu but I mostly come here for their lunch special.  Service is always friendly and the quality of food is consistent.  I really like their Pad Thai. It is quite different from other restaurants. It is less saucy and slightly sweeter.   Their lunch special comes with a spring roll, soup, and salad, but I always request for extra salad instead of the soup and spring roll. I love the salad dressing they use.  My only complaint is that the portion size of the lunch special main dish is too small. I don't eat that much -- I usually can't finish a regular sized dish at most places -- but I am not fully satisfied when I'm done and begin to feel hungry in a couple of hours. Their regular menu items come in bigger portion sizes though."}
{"text":"got take-out (green curry with chicken)...it was actually pretty good. might have to go back and try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"GREAT 4p: Price, Products, Place and Promotion   Great price for lunch (after tax is $10 which match my budget for weekday lunch) in downtown near my work mostly and food is hot, fast, fresh, delcious of course and come with free spring roll and soup + a little salad.  What can you ask for more?  Go there before it get popular and crowded. Going back soon."}
