{"text":"Food was so delicious (agedashi tofu is amazing and the portion size is huge). But most importantly, the staff there are amazing! My friend has lots of dietary restrictions but they were so accommodating. Would recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch today based on reviews here. I ordered nigiri toro as well as the negitoro roll and was served white albacore tuna. That, my friends, is totally unacceptable... If not willingly deceitful. (Waitress checked with the chef and informed us that the fish was albacore). Very disappointed, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner a few weeks ago and was not impressed. Highly priced, well I am from vancouver where half of the sushi places are dirt cheap. But, for the price I was highly disappointed! Miso Soup was different but really good!"}
{"text":"Be forewarned that this place is expensive - like $20 bento box expensive. But the food is really good, so I don't mind splurging here every once in while. A coworker and I headed over for lunch and split the gyoza, spicy salmon roll and prawn dynamite roll. They don't skimp on ingredients - everything is fresh and the rolls are decently proportioned. And unlike most Asian restaurants, the service is really good here.

So if you ever find your pockets lined with a little extra money, give this place a try - I think you'll like it as much as I do."}
{"text":"This was great. The miso soup was excellent and well presented. I had the spicy tuna roll and another roll and both were excellent. My lunch date also really enjoyed her food too (dynamite roll and avocado roll). It does get busy so lunch reservations are a good idea.

Service was also very good. Any delays that occurred were acknowledged and they were quick to clear empty plates and refill water which was appreciated. Prices were quite reasonable too. My only complaint is that it can get quite loud in there over lunch, making conversations hard to do from time to time. I'll still be back though!"}
{"text":"I cannot comment on the sushi as I never even got to try it! Went for lunch on Friday with two other co-workers. We were left waiting for almost an hour when we asked our server how much longer our meal would be. She said she would ask but then never returned to our table or made eye contact again. After watching many diners come in, eat, pay and leave, we asked another server what was going on. Were told they were short one sushi chef and it would be out shortly. We asked for our bill so we would be able to leave immediately after eating as we were now running very late. We were then offered three disgusting deep fried shrimp for our patience. At this point it was obvious our server had missed our order but at no point did she address our wait or offer any compensation. Finally after another half hour of waiting after paying and seeing many other diners still getting their food, I went up to our server to tell her we were leaving and we wanted our money back. She only looked at me blankly and asked what table I was at! She then had another server deal with us and return our money and never offered any apology for our wait. The server who returned our money tried to solve the problem but after waiting for 2.5 hours for food there wasn't much she could do to appease us. I understand things happen that are beyond control but not once did our server address the situation or offer us any sort of resolve besides telling us they were short a chef. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless you have 5 hours to spare for a leisurely meal. I wish I could speak to the overpriced sushi but unfortunately I will never know."}
{"text":"A great downtown sushi restaurant for lunch or dinner. My favorite part of Sukiyaki is the fact you can take non-sushi loving guests given it's full menu that caters to all. Not only is the sushi excellent, all of their choices are beautifully plated with unique flavors. The fish quality is the best in Calgary and service is quick with an excellent bar selection. 

I host business lunches and dinners at least twice a month given the reliability, quality and atmosphere. I find to helpful to make reservations and note what the event ideas they do an excellent job catering to your specific audience."}
{"text":"Good food - overpriced for quality and serving size - no parking availability - portions too small - servers are incompetent"}
{"text":"Regular there.  Great food and the owner really take the time to show her appreciation."}
{"text":"Reserved a table for 3 - one didn't show up.  However, the hostess knowing this didn't ask us to move to a table for two which would have been fine.  After a 40 minute lunch the hostess - Judith - gave us heck about this.  Five minutes later came up to our table and told us we needed to leave as our table was reserved for another party.  I have never been treated so poorly. 
On the upside we had a wonderful server who apologized for Judith's bad manners and our food was excellent!
Because of Judith's treatment won't be returning."}
{"text":"Best chicken teriyaki I've ever had! The sauce was light and not overpowering. Amazing flavor to that and the chicken!!
The quality in flavor and presentation was incredible!! We were very impressed. Having lived in Japan my standards of Japanese food is rather high. This place impressed. 

The Waldorf salad was beautifully presented and simply delicious! The gyoza was crisp on the outside and perfect on the inside. Great flavors!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place, very elegant presentation. Ok price. But my teriyaki chicken is very dry and ok veggies"}
{"text":"Very solid sushi bar in the downtown area.  Fast, friendly service, great fish, and innovative rolls.  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  I am a old foodie from when Japanese Village and Sukiyaki House were IT for Japanese food in the downtown core.  The neat thing about Sukiyaki House was that the sushi was always good, but the old location on 10th always had a musty smell due to the weird fountain / fish pond in front.  So, onwards to the new location on 9th.

Food - EXCELLENT sushi, prep and presentation.  I sampled the spicy salmon roll and the spider roll - these are couple of the best rolls I have had in a long time in DT.  There is a crunch to the very flavorful salmon roll that is a must-try.  And the spider roll which I find is a hit and miss in Calgary rates a 10 / 10 here.  It has been cleaned so there is no \"intestinal\" taste, and the tempura batter is very light and well done.  I will definitely have these again.  Their Atlantic salmon sashimi is also very fresh.  In fact, all the fish items were fresh, no misses here.
Service - efficient, friendly, non-intrusive.  Tea cups are filled regularly to ensure they remain hot and full, and the wait staff will ask if everything is OK. 
Parking - 2-hour street parking in front with Parkplus, a lot across the street and building parking in surrounding area.  Easy to find a space.

Overall, would rate this a solid 4 / 5.  I took off 1 small point for groups larger than 4 people.  The high celings make for a noisy place (which is not bad at all if you have 1-4 people at a small table), and for larger groups seated at long tables, you cannot hear someone three spaces over.  Will definitely return, esp. for the rolls.  For sentimental reasons, sad there were no more love boats offered."}
{"text":"Note: Be prepared to make a reservation if you are going at lunch during the week.

Now I haven't been to every Sushi restaurant in downtown, but so far Sukyaki House has the best yam roll. I am a vegetarian so no raw fish for me, but my companions always enjoy the fish rolls as well.

The best part of this place is the presentation and different feature flavours they offer. On my last trip my friend ordered a tuna roll and it came with this amazing mango sauce. 

Since I live for the sweets I must add that I had the chocolate soufflé for dessert, but they might as well have called it a lava cake. Delicious for sure, but not really a soufflé.

The service can be slow, so be prepared to sit back and take your time."}
{"text":"I was at the restaurant yesterday with the family for dinner. In short, a huge disappointment!  We were there early at around 5:15 pm. There was only one other table.  So no excuse for preparing one of the worst sushi rolls I ever had. We frequent sushi restaurants all the time and we can tell if they are no good. We ordered miso soup, chicken Yakitori, spicy tuna roll, spicy scallop roll, sweet Ebi shrimp, snow crab,  salmon nigiri rolls among others. Other than the miso soup and chicken Yakitori, we were hugely disappointed by everything else. We could not chew through the salmon nigiri as the vein in the salmon is too tough!  The waitress tried to explain that it is the belly of the salmon and he chef gave us the better cut.  We don't believe it for a second! The rice is also dry and frankly too much of it and too little fish!  I suspect they used the leftover rice from lunch and fish they did not sell from early in the day!

Overall, it is a ripoff and would not return ever."}
{"text":"My new favourite spot. Quality is excellent. Restaurant is beautiful. Spicy shrimp were a generous portion, tempura battered and the sauce had a hot heat to it. Drizzle a little lemon and this dish just pops. Beef tataki was another stunner. Ruby red meat, lovely ponzu sauce. Ebi nigiri was noticeably sweet and the texture was lovely, crunchy. 

I want to come back for the tempura, sukiyaki, and more sushi!

FYI - one of the chefs was the former chef/owner of Sushi Club, the head chef is specially trained for Japanese fine dining, and other used to work at Shokunin. You are in good hands!"}
{"text":"I am not sure if I came back on a good but this sushi was awesome.  Actually, I'm sure I came on a good day because I have been here a few times and this was the best time so far.  I am now saying the sushi was great.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lots of care put into prep. Fresh and delicious. Easily comparable to some of the quality sushi restaurants I've been to. Some seemingly typical menu items but with a twist. Nice."}
{"text":"We decided on Sukiyaki House because it was close to the Marriott, and was not terribly disappointed in the decision.  

Miso Soup was among the best I have EVER had.....nothing like the Miso 
anywhere else....full of Tofu, seaweed, green onion and shiitake mushroom.  Not salty at all!

House salad was tasty, but not the typical Japanese house salad....the dried cranberries, candied walnuts & Apple slices threw me off - but it was tasty....as long as you don't expect traditional ginger dressing.

Agadashi Tofu was crispy and HOT......so yummy.   Ordered salmon sashimi; fish was super fresh and melted in my mouth, but the bit of skin left on each piece was a bit of a bummer.  

California Roll is tasty, with REAL crab, but not a substantial portion , but it's pretty inexpensive.  Stampede Roll was quite good, with lots of flavor.  
Not sure why anyone would rate this place as expensive, the prices were quite reasonable, especially for a gal used to Los Angeles prices.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Got treated to lunch by my good friend at Sukiyaki House.  I had the Chef Sushi Sashimi Box with miso and salad.  I asked if I could have all salmon and they okayed it!  I love salmon especially sashimi.  Very delicious and fresh salmon.

My friend ordered off the sushi list and had tamago, salmon sashimi and a spider crab roll.  She thoroughly enjoyed her meal.  

Excellent wait service.

Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"When I have a sushi craving downtown during the work week; this is my go to spot.  Its pricey but its worth it.  The sashimi and sushi is always fresh and I'm always able to get a table.  I enjoy the sushi trio for lunch which usually includes a spicy tuna or salmon roll."}
{"text":"This is one of the better sushi restaurant in town. I came here and tried the lunch bento box for $25. It came with soup and salad, choice of beef or salmon, assorted chef special sushi and prawns.

I loved it. Its definitely one of the better sushi that I have ever had in Calgary. The sushi came out fresh. The salad is unique and tasty. The roasted walnut bits are glazed in sweet honey which made it unique. The salmon was nice even though the piece is small. Loved the miso soup. It had lots of seaweed (I like seaweed) and tofu. You can tell that they made it in house. 

This sushi restaurant is comparable to the restaurants in Vancouver. (Never been to Japan so don't know if its comparable there). 

The restaurant is quite small and you definitely will need to make a reservation (if not you might have a chance at the bar high chair). 

Atmosphere clean and trendy décor.

Highly recommend coming here. Loved their Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Sigh, I was terribly disappointed with how this dinning experience turned out. I was so excited to try a place that was in the same building I work in, and there was sushi! The food was excellence but considering I was there over lunch hour I'm afraid to say my expectations were not met when it came to timely delivery of our food. Many people in Calgary eat out during the lunch hour and because of this most restaurants can get you in and out within the hour. Sukiyaki house however, did not follow this trend. It took us over an hour to get our food which meant we had to stuff our faces to get back to the office in an hour and a half. There were no apologies even when we complained and the server just didn't seem to care that we were now thirty minutes late for going back to work. Sorry, to be the bearer of bad news but this place really disappointed me."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Really enjoyed the veggie sushi and tempura dinner! Nicely placed in downtown Calgary!"}
{"text":"Cheated by stopping at Sukiyaki House during a 5-week camping road trip. We were a bit tired  of cooking food over a camp fire and were really craving sushi. Sukiyaki House is really nice, classy ambiance, great service, extremely fresh fish - we loved the miso soup and the rolls we ordered. They had some unique rolls that were extremely refreshing to see. It was definitely expensive, I mean there are 3 dollar signs for a reason - but the quality and service is fantastic.  Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: The food, the service, the restaurant, all three are excellent. Come here for excellent Japanese food, return because of the service!

Try:
Organic Miso Soup
Waldorf Salad
Vegetable Tempura
Shrimp Tempura
Grilled Teriyaki Chicken
California Roll 

Pro:
Everything. The soup was savory yet light, the salad was crisp, with hints of tang and sweet, the tempura was crunchy and fried just enough. The grilled chicken was thick, juicy, and had the outside cooked just right to seal in the juices and provide texture. The accompanying vegetables were also outstanding, soft yet with enough resistance to give a nice bite.

The service was just amazing. They were friendly, of course, and knew when to check in, but they went above and beyond. After finding out that some of us are vegetarian, they made a custom vegetarian sauce for the tempura. We didn't even ask, they did it of their own volition!

The restaurant itself is elegant and minimalist.

Would absolutely recommend. And the price is worth it.

Con:
None!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but excellent quality sushi.  Their daily list of fresh fish and seafood from Japan has some interesting things on it.  Plate presentation and service was excellent."}
{"text":"It's just ok... Not the worst sushi I have had in Calgary, but nothing great!!  ... The fish is not very fresh ... But all the dishes taste ok...  The location is very convenient... If you are close and you really want sushi you can go there; however you shouldn't have high expectations..."}
{"text":"I was impressed. The service was excellent. Drinks frequently refilled, polite and friendly service.  The food was a little bit on the pricier side, but I feel it was worth it.  Beautiful decor and ambience, it feels like you are actually going out for dinner. The items we ordered we're plated beautifully and tasted divine. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After a year of searching all over downtown Calgary I believe this is the best.  Granted, I'm only in Calgary once a month, so perhaps my sample size isn't huge, but this was top-notch.  Very fresh, perfect standard rolls and sashimi, and some interesting creation rolls, too.  Rolls and sashimi were very good size.  Cost was appropriate for the quality and portions, perhaps a tad on the high side but that wouldn't stop me from returning and making this my go-to sushi.  If you care about ambience this has it.  Modern style, fairly bright lighting (lots of windows).  I could see it getting loud during peak hours but the food would be worth it.  Top notch."}
{"text":".I can't wait to share my experience with coworkers. I was looking for something light to eat and ordered the spicy prawn bite appetizer and green tea. I know it doesn't  sound like much, but the prawns are beautifully light and tasty, all in the right way. Its my last night in Calgary I'm almost tempted to go back for seconds. There was a couple next to me who ordered hot pots, it looks like fun and the food smelled delicious ."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS

I totally dig the ambiance... It's a cross between modern and minimalist with a hint of Asian vibe.
I could imagine closing the place up and throwing a dinner party here with an open sake bar.

We came here and the place was dead. 

We were greeted by the hostess and got seated right away. Glasses of water were delivered right away as well..which is good.

Looking at the sushi list. It wasn't at all impressive. There were a lot of rolls that contained cooked seafood. 

In my book. You are not a legit Japanese 'SUSHI\" restaurant without all the yummy RAW FISH. 

My excitement died...so we just ordered something minimal... (Trust me, i go all out at a japanese restaurant..first time in my life my table only consisted of one makimono roll)

*Beef Tataki: thinly sliced seared beef tenderloin topped with garlic chips and a citrus soy vinaigrette. I totally loved how the meat was perfectly seared. It was red and thinly sliced, and easy to eat. It was so addicting, I wanted to order a second plate. The only thing is... the vinaigrette sauce isn't that balanced. It was too much on the acidic side. a dash of sugar in the sauce would have done the trick. or some Sherry wine.

*Organic Miso Soup: A bit bland. The addition of mushrooms was an excellent choice. Didn't get much tofu and seaweed on my bowl though..which I usually expect in my miso.

*Toro Sashimi: ooooh. we got lucky as we got the last 2 slices. They were TOO THIN. I know Toro is the most expensive fish out there... but don't be all cheap with it. People who will order Toro will know they would have to pay at least $12 for 2 slices. So oomph it up a little bit.

*Prawn Tempura Dynamite: Eh. didn't do much for me. It's such a kindergarten roll. Nothing fancy. 

If you're a sushi newbie, or a sushi scaredy cat... come here and practice on their \"cooked\" rolls... however..if you're a sushi monster like myself... don't even try."}
