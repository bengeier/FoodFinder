{"text":"Super friendly and helpful girl at the register. Ordered the chipotle wrap with a build your own smoothie. The wrap was drenched in pure deliciousness and the smoothie was perfect. Super clean, warm, and calm environment. The price was slightly high for two people but, let me say that the ingredients being used are top notch, so you get what you pay for and it was all taste worthy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! All the food is super fresh and great quality. The owner is charming and eager to keep his customers happy. Hands down the best sandwiches and wraps in the downtown area!!"}
{"text":"First time here and the girl at the register is a sweet heart!  Thanks for a great experience everyone was amazing.  Now the food is out of this world. Fresh and clean eating at its best.  So refreshing I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Really quick service by a nice staff, wonderful sandwiches for a great price. The coffee is just what you need in the morning too."}
{"text":"Great little place near Fremont Street/Downtown. Natural ingredients and friendly service. Do yourself a favor and stop in for a bite!"}
{"text":"Wow. I didn't know this place was going to be this great! Clean! Quality ingredients. Tastes fresh and yummy. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. i created a yelp account just so i could leave a review for this place. Anyways...enough about me and more about the delicious food at Ameribrunch. Me and my wife were downtown today and were looking for a place to eat lunch at and we stumbled upon Ameribrunch. I ordered the meatball sub and my wife had the prosciuto panini. Holy cow!!! that was THE best meatball sub that i have ever had. My wife said that her panini was delicious too. After we got done eating we thanked every employee working there and the owner comes out from the kitchen to ask us if we had enjoyed our meal. I gave him my opinion and he started telling me about how he had owned Uncle Joe's pizza for 20 years. I had been to Uncle Joe's many times, but i had never met him. He explained how he perfected the meatball sub there. After thanking him we went on our way. To make a long story short, I just had to write a review about this place. I highly recommend this place, especially the meatball sub. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast.Fresh.Friendly....honestly looking for a good cheep place to eat when you're in a town or city you don't know can be hard but this place is GREAT! Not expensive at all and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"While in downtown Vegas, I needed a quick spot to satisfy my hunger and thirst in the morning while strolling the streets.. I quickly looked inside and they served Lavazza Coffee and freshly toasted panini, which is an A+ in my book. The management was friendly and attentive and pointed us out to hit some of their favorite spots in downtown.. Will definitely go back to this quaint little gem!"}
{"text":"I have become a huge fan of this little downtown jewel. FINALLY, a spot with fresh delicious food that won't break the bank. The breakfast muffins are super tasty and the wraps are divine. The owner is extremely accommodating and the staff are all friendly and well-versed on the menu. Breakfast or lunch.. this is the place to go when you work or live downtown. Period."}
{"text":"Nice place to have a quiet breakfast, paninis and coffee are really good. Fair price also."}
{"text":"Loved the vegan sandwich. Lots of color and texture. Also helps that it tastes great. Came in with my family and we all enjoyed our meals!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast cafes I've been in the US. Avocado sandwich is delicious and espresso coffee and cappuccino have rich taste and definitely better than Starbucks. One star off for the poor ventilation of the place - you will definitely smell food after visiting."}
{"text":"The service was good, but the food was not. I got the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were so dry and it was obvious that they were frozen. I don't like how the biscuits were served upside down with the the gravy covering the harder bottoms. That was a first for me. Then the side of bacon was burnt that it crumbled into tiny pieces when you picked it up. Not good!"}
{"text":"Had a nice quiet family breakfast here. Smoothies were fresh and tasty. Friendly staff. Beware the yelp coupon does NOT work. Yelp just advertises it without asking the owner. Trying to get my money back."}
{"text":"Always love trying different spots I haven't tried before! So we decided to try out AmeriBrunch! Everyone was super friendly as we walked in the door. The menu wasn't overwhelming, which is good for me...otherwise we'd order more than we did, just because we're big foodies and love to try different things. 

We ordered the cuban panini, waffles and sausage, cesar salad and the lox with no bread. Everything was super tasty..definitely a thumbs up! We did not go wrong!

The staff was accommodating, friendly and professional! They for sure have a great team!

We definitely will be back to try the other great looking items on the menu! So if you're in the downtown area...it's a must to stop by!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for breakfast then this is a really good stop. Had the waffles and sausage and it couldn't be any more perfect. On top of that, the employees are super nice. Gonna be stopping here more often for lunch."}
{"text":"Coffee good, Hot!, BLTA bagel good, except the avocado was cubed and not ripe. In other words, hard and woody with bitter taste. Just let the customer know you have no ripe avocados and let them make decision if they want to leave it off."}
{"text":"Great new owners! Amazing macarons and I love their coffee :) the menu is healthy! Also so close to Fremont"}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks. Chai latte is the best I've had anywhere. Always great quality and very friendly. You can tell the owners are passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas since 1952, so to find a place to grab coffee and breakfast with a smile that tastes good was a treat. Friendly, clean, quite and good food."}
{"text":"Great tasting, affordable cafe, just off Fremont street. After the craziness of Life is Beautiful festival, we just needed a quiet, and quick breakfast away from the hustle and bustle of Fremont st. We stopped in here and our orders were quickly taken by the guy behind the counter. He seemed a bit dozy, but the girl making all the drinks and checking in with the kitchen was on the ball and kept checking in with him.

We ordered a sausage egg and cheese on a croissant and the turkey pesto panini. The croissant was soft and fluffy and the eggs and sausage tasted fresh. The turkey pesto was nicely crispy on the outside with a heap of fillings on the inside. 

The tea/coffee offerings were top quality. I will defo be back here again when I'm in DTLV!"}
{"text":"Pretty chill environment, the food is good. I chose the ABLT bagel with an egg. The owner seemed friendly, wasn't quite engaging but nevertheless, great meal before going into work. The music was nice and it wasn't loud in this restaurant as some downtown tend to be.. very clean and the smell was amazing. I may have to stop by again if I'm in the neighborhood (since I work down here )"}
{"text":"For $9.00 this sandwich definitely did not live up to my expectations...

Based on how some of the food was presented online (and the price), I really thought the vegan sandwich would be this yummy gourmet beauty. Sounded really good on paper, but immediately when it came and I saw the presentation - basically a bunch of spinach on some store bought wheat bread with lays BBQ chips - I realized it wasn't going to be what I expected. It kinda looked like something my mom (who thinks vegans just eat grass or something) would try and whip out for me. I also found it strange that the sandwich was not even cut in half. Felt like I was eating a brick. Kinda odd. Even as a vegan, I could probably do better at Subway. 

My suggestion would be to put it on some nicer bread, less spinach, and maybe add some pesto to it or something like that. 

On the plus side green detox smoothie was well worth it."}
{"text":"This place popped up while browsing postmates and I'm so glad it did. Since finding it two weeks ago, I have ordered from them 3 times! They are close to my work so when we have a busy surgery day I can always get my brunch in! I absolutely love their avocado toast over a bed of spinach with two over easy eggs! 
Their iced dirty chais are amazing.
Try their macaroons, I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Great menu and pricepoint, good location, working on the execution and service. Located downtown and offering a quick, healthy, and inexpensive alternative to the usual options around Fremont.

Menu has a variety of baked (offsite) goods, sandwiches (on bagels and as paninis), and salads, as well as beverages (hot/cold coffee and tea, smoothies). Specials include a $3 coffee-and-croissant combo offered 7:30-10:30, and a few daily featured sandwiches for lunch for $7. It's easy to get out of here spending ~$10/person with multiple items.

Unfortunately the execution needs work. Their vanilla chai was hot with a good sweet-and-spicy balance, but the apricot croissant was mostly hollow with a minimal filling, which tasted overly sweet and artificial. Chicken caprese salad did not match menu description or my expectations, but was decently fresh and a good high protein, low carb lunch choice.

Service was polite, but seemed frazzled despite there only being a handful of customers. Manager/owner was prompt about addressing issues and making corrections, but there seemed to be some confusion with orders between the POS and the kitchen.  

TIP: They offer an awesome $25 for $50 credit Yelp deal, but prices are so low here that you'll need a large group to spend that much in a single visit."}
{"text":"The staff was really nice.  The food was fantastic, I am going to come here next time i visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The vegan sandwich was a total disappointment. It was two stale prices of bread with the smallest portion of avocado and veggies. I was seriously upset, my meal that day was not worth the price or drive."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious. Glad we stopped by even though its a little hidden when your from our of town."}
{"text":"You can ignore this review if you don't intend to get waffles or hot chocolate and a little sloppiness is ok.  

It's a nice looking place.  You order at the counter.  Get your own water if you want any.  We ordered two hot chocolates, a burrito and waffles.   When she brought the food out, we reminded her we had ordered hot chocolates.  Off she went to get our hot chocolates.  

So, we'll eat while we wait for the drinks that usually come first.  My waffles were room temperature, if that.  I asked for some butter on the side.  Put some on a waffle and none of it melted.  My sausage, however was hot.  It was delicious.  But, back to the waffles.  I had a few bites.  I hate to complain at restaurants and usually just put up with little things - but these were too cold.  So I took the plate over and explained the problem. They said they'd fix another.   

While I waited, they brought out the \"hot chocolate.\"  Turns out they don't have hot chocolate, they have steamers.  Only these didn't have enough chocolate to cover the taste of the milk.   We tried stirring them, but no chocolate had settled at the bottom.  So that was a waste of money.  

My new waffles arrived.   Same temperature as the first plate.  By then, I was hungry enough to just put up with it.  So I ate half of them, despite the problem.  The barista delivered food to another table, so I asked him to come over.   I said I wasn't going to ask for another order or a refund, but I was curious how they could make two plates of waffles and neither were warm, let alone hot.   He said they don't make their own waffles.  They go from the freezer to a refrigerator, to a convection oven.   We suggested they check the length of time or the temperature of the oven.  He thanked us for the feedback, but made no effort to offer a refund or other compensation.

The other thing to keep in mind if you use a credit card is it asks you how much of a tip you want to leave.  I left twenty percent.   I suggest you tap the no tip option and bring your tip in cash so you can decide the value of your meal and service AFTER your meal, not before."}
{"text":"Walking distance from our hotel downtown. Great breakfast options from egg dishes, egg sandwiches and plates. Great option to Starbucks because they have a variety of coffee, expresso, cappuccino and tea options. Had a toasted bagel with cream cheese and lox six bucks! Very nice staff and counter help, small dining area but quaint.  Great prices, good variety of menu options"}
{"text":"Food is good quality and prices are reasonable compared to hotel and casino options.

Breakfast has been quiet the 3 or 4 times we've been here - I'm guessing it's a lunch place.

They are happy to customize for you - I ordered a ham and cheese on toasted croissant for breakfast although they considered it a 'sandwich.' 

The breakfast pastry options are your standard sweet cakes eg not terribly good. My mother says the coffee cake tastes like lemon cake.

The place is spotless - exceptionally clean!"}
{"text":"Loved this place this place ordered the Turkey Panini on a rosemary foccacia, and a double shot espresso. I'm not a big coffee drinker, and usually when I get my double shot at Starbucks I need to add milk, sugar, vanilla, and cacao to mask the burnt taste.  

Here I didn't need to add anything to the coffee as it tasted amazing.  I couldn't have been more satisfied with my lunch, and I got to meet the owner who was a wonderful guy. 

 I will definitely make a point to come back and finish trying the rest of the menu. This place is perfect for a quick fresh lunch. It's not to pricey and convenient with excellent service. 

I will recommend this place to all my friends!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great new place. So friendly! They are going to add some great things to the menu like Acai bowls.. loved the avocado toast and breakfast sandwich. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Went in for a cup of coffee and a sausage egg English muffin. The bread on the English muffin needed to be toasted but was otherwise decent, maybe a bit too greasy. My main issue was with the guy charging me $0.50 per pump of vanilla syrup in my $1.50 cup of mediocre coffee. When I asked how much it was to add vanilla he said $0.50, not $0.50 per pump. That honestly doesn't even make sense when he charges $3.50 for a caramel macchiato which has expresso and syrups."}
{"text":"We found this place by searching for cheaper breakfast joints near Fremont. So glad we tried it. Not only is the food amazing, you get a ton of food for very little cost. We have gone 2 days in a row and were able to get 2 bagel sandwiches, a muffin and a coffee for under $12! The hubs has ordered the double sausage, egg and cheddar both days and I have tried the BLTA and a tomato egg and cheese bagel. Both fantastic!

Not only is the food good, the service is amazing!!! The owner has assisted us both days and he is wonderful. Friendly, helpful and giving are just some of the words that come to mind.

Parking is tough. We have been lucky and found street parking. We pay $1 to give us an hour (too much time) but there aren't other options. They do deliver but not sure how far they deliver. From Fremont it's only a 5-10 min walk. 

We will definitely keep this hidden gem in mind if we stay near Fremont again. Hard to find anywhere that gives you good quality food for an adorable price anymore but this guy is nailing it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast/lunch spots. 
I'v had a more than a few things off the menu; the food/drinks are always fresh (he uses natural & fresh ingredients) & good. Not to mention the best customer service for such a high traffic location."}
{"text":"Stopped in here because I was going to go to that Starbucks across the street, then I saw there was a line of like 18 lawyers and nowhere to sit. 

$3.50 for a superior version of the Egg McMuffin plus a coffee sealed the deal. Also plenty of places to sit, WiFi, and great service. 

High Five!"}
{"text":"Omg Thank you!! I will deffinitely be using Postmates and checking out your website!! I'm a stay at home mom with no car while my husband's at work so being able to get ameribrunch delivered is beyond perfect! You have no idea what a life saver delivered coffee has been!!! Lol and my 11 month old son loves avocado and cream cheese and bread lol so it's perfect to share with him. Honestly ordering delivery through you always starts my day out on a.great note! I'm happy and caffeinated and my son and I are both full!! So really thank you so much !! So happy I can still get you delivered !!!!"}
{"text":"The person that took my order was really nice and the food was fantastic; this is a great place to come to before work or if you're in the area. 

Parking is only $2 per hour with a 4 hour maximum. I'd say it's about a 45 minute experience from ordering to getting the food, eating and leaving. An hour parking should be fine.

{"text":"Great breakfast sandwich. Fresh made cannelloni was super. Everything here is made fresh, staff are super nice."}
{"text":"Very very delicious and fresh organic ingredients... Definitely try this place if you love healthy high quality food. My new spot"}
{"text":"Wonderful service! Very clean and then menu selections are great! This was the perfect breakfast and so healthy too!"}
{"text":"We decided not to pay for a huge breakfast buffet and yelped to find something close to the casino. This place fit the bill nicely. My avocado and tomato breakfast sandwich was egg-celent! An everyone else enjoyed their breakfast as well."}
{"text":"Me and my friend came here on a search for a nice brunch place. Ameribrunch seems a little small but there's more seating towards the side for more privacy. They definitely have that cute cozy charm here. The cashier and barista were super nice and answered any questions I had while giving good recommendations. I ordered the tomato basil soup, BLTA, and an amaretto white mocha while my partner got the detox smoothie and the all American breakfast sandwich. Everything was delicious, fresh, and so comforting! I'd definitely come here again. Thank you staff for the suprise complimentary macarons!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Coffee was good, smoothie was good, food was good. Everything was decently priced too which is a plus."}
{"text":"My husband and i ate there for lunch.  He ate the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup which was delicious.  I had the avacado toast with scrambled eggs. Very delicious food nice atmosphere. A short uber ride from the hotel.  Cheap lunch and worth it!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot ! Worth the drive and they are friendly, very willing to make your coffee perfect !!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a healthier option for breakfast and found this great place.  The smoothies were delicious and the sandwiches filling. The decor was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Ordered from here through Postmates while in town. Loved the homemade blueberry muffins, bagel sandwich and green smoothies. Everything tastes freshly made. I'll order again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Handled are large party amazingly well. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great quality for the price. I get the caprese sandwich with prosciutto on a croissant with pesto on the side and it is AMAZING. I have digestive issues and can't have cheese or meat too often, so when I do I spoil myself. I usually get a salad with no cheese or meat. If you're vegan, the Greek dressing has pasteurized milk. I didn't know this until I read the label with the dressing already on my salad. If you work in the area I HIGHHHHLLLYY suggest you order ahead. You will save ATLEAST 10-15 minutes of your time."}
{"text":"This is a great location, great staff and really quite yummy food for the price.

I was looking for something close to the hotel that I could pick up our lunches from and head out in an Uber to the workshop so this little gem was awesome to find. I went in and ordered. It was pretty seamless, lots of seating inside and the food came out in very generous serves as well as being super tasty."}
{"text":"My family and I walked over from the Golden Nugget & I'm so glad we did! The staff was sooooo friendly & helpful when deciding what to order. I got the avocado toast with a lavender rose latte. SOOOO delicious. We will definitely be back tomorrow before our departure."}
{"text":"So awesome! Yummy latte and awesome vegan sandwich before a huge work day. Definitely check this place out-"}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a treat....clean, friendly, delicious!!! The pictures matched the breakfast burrito!!! Great breakfast stop if you are staying downtown!!! That's my wife eyeing my frappi because I totally out ordered her! Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place was great! Not far from Fremont street, and a short walk from our hotel. I had the avocado toast which was perfect. My husband enjoyed his drip coffee and breakfast burrito. Quick service, seat yourself but they bring it out. We recommend!"}
{"text":"My only gripe is they didn't have salt bagels (and it isn't my gripe, it is my husband's).  The coffee was hot and delicious, and he put almond milk in for free.  Most places charge you which is rude, but the counter attendant obliged with no issue!  

It is honestly a great place to get a light breakfast for $4, which is what we were after.  Nothing frilly, nothing gourmet, but good.  

NOTE: it is next to a bail bonds place in what appears to be an office building.  We had an issue following the directions because it looked like we were there but we couldn't find it.  Maybe because we are stupid?  But maybe you are too..."}
{"text":"This place really impressed me. It is really hard to find a good food in vegas, I think its mainly because its all about alcohol and gambling, but this place can hold its own in San Diego. The wraps were amazing. The smoothies really gave you a good kick. The staff was wonderful. I love this place."}
{"text":"I love the food! I've only ordered through Postmates (once or more a week for the past few weeks). Their quality and portions are great for the price. I love their breakfast and salads. The smoothies and coffee are also top notch! I just wish Postmates would stop forgetting parts of my orders"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is excellent! Me and my husband tried the croissants,  Nutella cheesecake and macaroons, we loved it and definitely will be back when in town!"}
{"text":"I really loved this little cafe conveniently located 2 blocks from work. A little cramped for socializing once a good crowd comes in, but service is friendly, food is tasty, and atmosphere is comfy"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I've had their tomato, avocado, and cream cheese bagel sandwich and croissant sandwich. Its not bad but I wish they would toast the bread more and not go so heavy with the cream cheese. I would say i'd order again though to try other things from the menu!"}
{"text":"Reason for two stars is I went there to order a breakfast sandwich (egg, avocado, tomato, cream cheese) and they gave me the wrong order."}
{"text":"Delicious with quite a wait. If you're interested in a calm and tasteful brunch this is the place. Just don't be in a rush."}
{"text":"Jury Duty was dull but my lunch at this place was delightful and the service was charming:)
I had the turkey and pesto panini on focaccia and a bottle of water.  I don't have a huge appetite so I only ate half, the other half I finished on the ride home."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab lunch with your buddies; super rustic, cozy vibe and the music is the perfect volume. I don't know why that's important, but the music is just at a really pleasant volume. Typical American food, soups and sandwiches etc. Park on the street if you can and don't forget to pay the meter."}
{"text":"My wife and I did NOT feel like waiting at the Downtown Grand for an hour for a seat at their brunch so we popped online to see what was close and had good reviews. Up pops AmeriBrunch which has good ratings and was less than half a mile from the hotel. We walked over, which for my wife was even more walking after a day up and down the strip, and walked in to a very clean and near empty cafe. 
Love the staff, extremely nice and friendly, and my wife had the Caprise Salad, alcohol recovery food, and I had the burrito. Both were very good and so I asked why wasn't the place filled. The young man, family member of the owners, said on the weekends it's based on events occurring on Fremont and downtown, which often end up in very long lines. During the week it's in the business district so it stays packed. There is definitely a reason it gets High reviews. The food was solid, the people running it are more than courteous and we liked the coffee a lot."}
{"text":"Make sure you don't ask what flavored bagels they have or you'll get an attitude from the \"lady\" taking your order. I asked if the BLTA came with cream cheese, I guess that was a big mistake. The employee said no and was shaking her head at me and said I was very demanding. Like wtf? I explained to her it was my first time their and wanted to know what came on the sandwich.  She said I need to be more humble when ordering lol. Goes without saying I didn't make an order. They lost 1 customer"}
{"text":"Ameribrunch is a cute, small, big-city style cafe/deli with such a homey feel. 

I ordered their avocado, tomato, and cream cheese bagel with a hot caramel macchiato. Everything was delicious!

1) Their food was fresh, fast, and there were great portions. I didn't pay 5 dollars for just a measly bagel. In fact, my fancy coffee and bagel were about 7 bucks. 
2) I didn't know what to expect when walking in, but it's not really a restaurant. More of a quick, grab a bite, and head to work kind of place. 
3) The service was excellent. The man behind the counter was friendly and has great energy! 
4) The location is great for anyone working in the heart of downtown, but is also convenient for those of us that don't. 

Would I go again? Definitely. I dig the vibe and the service was most excellent. 
Would I  recommend to friends? Yes. Hopefully the lunch time rush during the week isn't too wild."}
{"text":"Great little secret cafe downtown! I come here on my lunch breaks and am never disappointed. Best coffee downtown and super affordable. I'm always looking for a good cannoli and they have it here!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Las Vegas and stumbled across this restaurant. What a gem!!!! The food was delicious and made quickly! The staff and owner were nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"Great experience and excellent customer Service. Did read served quickly and a nice place to hangout especially for people who work around the area."}
{"text":"Uncle joe is a great guy. Always provides excellent customer service. Not to mention the breakfast sandwiches here are fire."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet place not far from Fremont Street.  The food was excellent, and the service was prompt and genuinely friendly."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this new little bistro! The owner is friendly, the ambiance is enjoyable, and the food is delicious! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! ate breakfast here every day while in Vegas. Breakfast sandwichs are great, coffee is the bomb. Hospitality is top notch. On our last day in town, they comped some food and drink...just because. Super nice!!!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible, seems like they got the ingredients from Wal mart...redeeming fact was the service was excellent and staff friendly"}
{"text":"Sooo good.  Very happy I came.  I chose this place solely base on Yelp reviews and the staff, food did not disappoint.  I needed a meeting spot between north west and Henderson.  My maps found it easily.   11:30am there were no parking challenges.   Very clean and had a secret bathroom.   Free Wi-Fi was strong."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and stayed for lunch! This place is the most affordable and quality place to eat around the downtown area and i highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Me and my husband were just in Las Vegas over the weekend and stayed in a Hotel on Fremont Street and were looking for a place that served fresh entrees but also had Good reviews, and so we found this place and it was Amazing! The owners were very attentive and hospitable and Espicially knowledgeable about their Tea's and coffee's! We went every morning and would definitely return on any future visits!"}
{"text":"I like this little place. I parked right in front of it to walk over to the courthouse, but after getting my speeding fine reduced from $208 to $23, I figured I'd grab myself a celebratory breakfast sandwich. Hooray!

It was cool to look over the menu and see a great variety of choices next to awesome, fair prices. My beautiful BLTA croissant was about $5 with stellar service to boot. The girl who took my order gave great suggestions and helped me decide on a winner.

Will definitely come back whenever I'm in the area during brunch time."}
{"text":"The owner of this place puts an incredible amount of care into what he does. The food is simple but delicious and fairly priced."}
{"text":"This place rocks, we work right next door and with so many great options around this area it is saying something if we say its good.  The service was awesome, the Turkey Pesto was awesome, the price is a little high but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Loved this quiet quaint coffee shop which was walking distance from the golden nugget hotel as well as Fremont street. They accommodated our keto diet too!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and was happy with the selections, specials and drinks. They have a bunch of different smoothies, coffees, paninis, salads and wraps.

My arugula salad with parm and figs had an excellent, light dressing and crisp greens. The kale and apple salad was decent, although I was disappointed with the amount of kale and other toppings... it seem d to be missing something. The paninis were hot and loaded with fresh toppings. I like that the menu changes a bit daily. Great place for a quick bite or ordering ahead for lunch."}
{"text":"Good panini, good service. Stopped by after jury duty. Comes with a salad which makes it worth the 7$. DT needs more small cafes. I'd love to see some outside seating when the weather breaks"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, was going to go to Starbucks across the street. Do yourself a favor and come here instead of the place across the street. Had a vanilla late (which was awesome) and a BLT. BLT was amazing. Perfect amount of bacon and mayo. They also put avocado on it which mixes with the warm bacon perfect."}
{"text":"Awesome, delicious and reasonable prices. Fresh, homemade. Family-run. What a pleasant surprise after hotel mega brunches to have good ingredients and care. The baked goods are next level, Just beautiful. Overall they have healthy options and traditional options. An unexpected gem, and they were so kind and we all loved our breakfasts. will def return!"}
{"text":"I was a tourist in the downtown Vegas casinos & limited and uncertain wi-fi access at those places (I passed four other businesses along the way who didn't).  AmeriBrunch was an OASIS there.  Just two blocks away, I could check email & the news.  Plus, great \"healthy\" food options to what's in the casino.  My body thanked me for a kale salad, loved a latte at a normal price.  Did I mention they have WI-FI!!  Love these guys.  Visit when you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been coming here every day for lunch for the past week after starting a new job nearby. The food is wonderful and fresh, the service is friendly and as fast as they can be even when they're busy, and the prices are fair and honestly, in my opinion, rather cheap especially for what you get. I'm obsessed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been in Las Vegas for 4 days. We even attended a wedding at a country club and Ameribrunch was by far the tastiest meal we've had the ENTIRE time. Yum. Yum yum. Staff was amazing as well. We even enjoyed our interactions with the other customers."}
{"text":"Stopped here hoping to find some good food a little off Fremont Street.  Very quiet, as this is in the legal district, and most people in the area were busy working when I came in (around 10:30).  The area is in walking distance, so you don't need to take a cab if you're coming from Fremont.  

Ambiance is nice, the place has a clean yet warm feel to it.  Since I was one of the only people in there, there were no issues ordering.  The menu is somewhat limited but still has a variety of options.  I decided on a chipotle wrap.  

The good news is that the service is good at the food came out fairly quick.  The bad news is that the wrap left a little something to be desired.  I thought, based on the size, that I'd have enough for later, since it appeared pretty good sized.  However, a lot of the interior was filler and empty space, which was a bit disappointing.  It could do with some more meat to help it fill out a little.  

When I was here (about 10am on a Thursday), it was very quiet.  So this is an ok spot if you want to have somewhere quiet to relax and eat, away from the hectic Fremont St, but still in walking distance."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place for sandwiches and breakfast delights. The sandwiches are great and fresh. My favorite is the hot chocolate made with real milk they even offer choices of milk to make it"}
{"text":"Servers and staff are friendly. Food is good. It's a fun place to hang out and people watch with a cup of coffee. I highly recommend the red velvet cake. I don't go here too often though since they have trouble remembering to use decaf instead of regular coffee. So I only go there when I can risk getting dosed"}
{"text":"This was my second time dining here. 

The first time was... Horrible. I ordered the chicken panini which is chicken, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, and avocado on focaccia. I switched the bread based on the recommendation of the very friendly redheaded cashier.  After a significant wait period, the sandwich came out. 1st try - Not toasted. 2nd time - No avocado. 3rd time - No Swiss cheese. I was so irate that I almost lost it. I didn't even want the staff to fix the cheese issue and remake it. The staff explained that they were short staffed, that my order was confused with order before mine. A gentleman in the back apologized profusely as did the nice cashier. They offered me a $10 voucher to come back and give them a second try. If that service recovery measure hadn't been offered, I was going to walk out  (sandwich uneaten)even though I had friends eating there. For the record, my two friends did not have issues with their orders. Also, I came in the midst of rush lunch hour, 12p. 

Service snafus aside... I came in today to use the $10 voucher at 1130a. I was the only person in line. Order was placed and I received what I ordered exactly as ordered. (Kale salad add chicken with an Americano)

Food is fresh and great value for the normal price point for Downtown. Salad was nice and fresh. My two friends who convinced me to eat here the first time when I had my panini snafu come here at least once a week. So this is a solid lunch spot to add to the rotation. 

I would come back again to eat here. I came on a bad day and want this spot to succeed."}
{"text":"Place is bomb. Great coffee! Great ambiance! Great people! Only place to go for coffee downtown. Cold brews, French press, slow drips, frappinis galore! Stop by if you're looking for great coffee, pastries and a quite place to get some work done."}
{"text":"Great cheap but delicious breakfast spot while staying here for work at The Golden Nugget! Also a nice option for some good healthy choices!"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is a perfect little quiet downtown hipster coffee shop. They have a pretty extensive menu. Brunch, breakfast, lunch, all good here. So many coffee options. I came here with my girlfriend who is very particular and asked so many questions about the coffee menu. The girl at the front was so accommodating and understanding about her indecisiveness. She handled her so well and was so friendly. Every Vegas local should pay this place a visit."}
{"text":"What I paid for is not what I got. 
I ordered the Italian melt panini with a side salad through postmates.
It was simple and plain. All it was was a slab of meat and cheese with a couple of pieces of lettuce and peppers. Like seriously? What a joke!!! Not worth the money. At all. 
And the salad was just some lettuce and a ton of onion and tomato. Overkill with the onion. Stunk up the office. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Very classy place ...I had a caramel frappe it was delicious I would totally recommend this place. Awesome atmosphere and great customer service."}
{"text":"ANOTHER DOWNTOWN GEM. 


AmeriBrunch, situated in the heart of downtown, is an wonderfully tucked away breakfast spot that serves quality meals at a great price. Definitely one of the most economical locations looking for a breakfast or quick lunch in the downtown area. 

The menu ranges from a selection of breakfast sandwiches to salads to wraps. My favorite category they offer is their sandwiches and paninis. The paninis comes on warm, toasted bread with the signature panini marks. A win each time I order. 

The service is friendly, which makes for a very comfortable dine in experience. You will always feel welcome here, whether alone or in a group of friends. If you squint your eyes hard enough, Ameribrunch, next to one of the tallest buildings downtown, almost feels like a breakfast shop in Manhattan, not Las Vegas. I think this effect is desired and it definitely pairs well with the menu and overall interior design. Ameribrunch is a well executed restaurant with enough food items to keep it in your food rotation. Well done."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Family owned and operated. Great food. Great service. Great prices."}
{"text":"Live downtown and there isn't a lot of option for good food and coffee without all the fuss. Found this gem. Easy to deal with, amazing good food and reasonable prices. Super convenient and one of a kind downtown."}
{"text":"This is my favorite new cafe in LV. I love the bagel sandwiches and their breakfast menu is superb for a cafe. I haven't tried their lunch menu yet but that would be the next thing I try when I am in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Not bad but nothing amazing. The pictures made it look a little nicer than it was. It's pretty much a coffee shop with sandwiches/wraps. They were out of waffles. Selection of coffee was good. Prices were pretty low too.Think we were expecting something else"}
{"text":"Turkey and pesto panini is amazing. Also the turkey sub. Owner is so friendly and the food is so reasonably priced. Best lunch spot with local prices."}
{"text":"Bushi is SOOOO friendly, he made us feel right at home & helped me figure out my \"bread type\".. We were glad that somewhere downtown had GREAT prices AND no smoking.. Can't beat it!!!"}
{"text":"We were headed for Starbucks, but they were closed. I'm glad they were. This place is a hidden Gem! We were in search of hot coffee, food & a bathroom after running a 5K. Found all 3 here. We ordered the Turkey Panini's(2),a Coffee & a hot chocolate. Best panini I've had in a long time. Generous portions & it comes with a side salad with homemade dressing. I chose the Italian dressing. It was very good. Prices are reasonable. Staff is so friendly. I did not bring my wallet only some cash. After ordering I realized I might not have enough cash on me. I told the gentleman behind the counter to take off one panini. That I didn't have enough $. He told me don't worry about it. 
After all was said and eaten. Turns out I had exactly the right amount plus a tip. 
Check this place out. Clean, friendly & Yummy!"}
{"text":"Yummy, fast clean and just a short 2 block walk from Freemont street. Check it out for sure!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise this cafe was!  We are from out of town, and found this cafe on Yelp. The service was great!  My son is a very picky eater, and the cashier allowed us to customize our order without any hesitation.  

I had the tomato basil soup and grilled cheese sandwich. OMG!  The best grilled cheese and tomato soup I've ever had!  The coconut ice latte is ridiculously delicious!!  I'm a big fan of this place, and will definitely come back on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to have your breakfast and lunch. Super friendly people and neat place. The price is friendly. I have a Italian panini and it's great! If you are in downtown Vegas and want to have some nice food, you should definetly come here."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that AmeriBrunch doesn't  offer BYO cups for drinks. I'll still continue to come here. The food is always great, the smoothie I had was amazing. I will have to opt out on since they use plastic cups."}
{"text":"Came upon this eatery through Yelp. We were greeted immediately as we entered and given instructions on the menu and asked if they could answer any questions. This place is clean and has a really nice \"loft\" vibe. My husband LOVED the Sausage and Cheddar sandwich adding an egg. I had their fruit parfait and a bagel with a very healthy portion of cream cheese. Both were fresh and deeeelicious! A LOT of food for a nominal price. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Mom and pop lunch / breakfast spot. I had a smoothie that was quite tasty. For lunch I had a chicken wrap on tomato basil tortilla. Prices are really good. $6ish for a panini/wrap + $2 for chips and drink. The food tasted fresh and portions were good. 

Check the blackboard outside for morning specials and daily specials. 

Overall , fresh tasty food at decent prices."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, but everything they do is really well done, tasty, and reasonably priced! I would DEFINITELY go here again!"}
{"text":"I go to Ameribrunch for lunch at least once a week because it is within walking distance of my current externship.

I've tried many of the panini sandwiches on their menu and they're all delicious. Each panini comes with a side salad and medium-sized drink. The chicken caprese salad was very flavorful and fresh as well. I haven't tried the breakfast bagel sandwiches yet. However, there are ample options to choose from.

Their menu also includes coffee and smoothie options. The berry smoothie was tasty and will leave you craving for a refill. If you like strong coffee, I recommend the double shot of espresso.

The prices are really reasonable for the quality of the food and beverages offered. Also, the staff is very friendly. Even the owner is behind the counter helping out, which you don't see very often. You can tell he is very passionate about his business and cares about his patrons."}
{"text":"I visited this place based on Yelp reviews. 
I was a surprised at how small this place was. Not sure why I was expecting different though, but I always try to go in with an open mind so I'm not surprised by anything. Anyways, they had a small breakfast menu, only 5 or 6 options and there are other things that you can order not on the menu as well. The croissant breakfast sandwich is good, nothing to write home about. Maybe similar to how I would make it at home, but I'd add more spices to flavor if up some more. The grapefruit juice is superb!! 
I'd probably visit again just for the juice and nothing else. Breakfast for 2 came to nearly $25, which seemed like a little much for two small sandwiches (no sides) and 2 juices."}
{"text":"This place was soo lovely!!! I love it here we've been years before but still remembered to come back! Love the breakfast and the coffee  omg yum!!!! Super reasonable u can get so many things at a great price and the food is yummers !!!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to downtown for the regulars in the old Fritters.  Good sandwiches, wraps, salads, smoothies and specials.  I have not tried breakfast there but they do have high quality food in generous portions.  Good turkey sandwiches.  Friendly service at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best chai tea latte I have ever had! I also had the cream cheese egg and tomato bagel and it was delicious. Good price, good service, fast. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great, service was super slow and because they were a TAD backed up, they wouldn't allow me to order a smoothie. After I ordered my smoothie, the cashier looked back at the person making smoothies, looked back at me and said, \"Sorry, we're not making anymore smoothies today. Only coffee or lattes.\" Funny enough, they let the person behind me in line order some. Cool. Not to mention their system for dropping food off at tables was so horrible...no numbers and no names. Just auctioning off random food items. Wouldn't suggest this place for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Great coffee, quiet ambience, comfy chairs and it always feels like a coffee shop from a big city like Portland or Seattle. My getaway spot before work or during lunch."}
