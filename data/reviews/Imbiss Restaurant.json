{"text":"This place used to be an OK place but not since new ownership about a year ago. It has really become rundown. I was really hungry and ordered brunch, my table had crumbs all over it, the bacon was burnt and my plate was chipped.  I also asked for peanut butter and jam for my toast and they didn't have peanut butter.  I am not expecting much from a greasy spoon diner but come on. Plus I was the only customer in there and they had the show \"the view\" on, volume on full blast. I just couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"Well, the food is alright, a bit oily and cheap, but for the prices and area, it is just a bit substandard. I say go for the Chicken Souvlaki on a pita, and the combo is not a bad idea. One thing to do here however is as follows:

Look at the bill you are giving the teller
Say its face value, out loud
Count your change
Nearly got conned out of a tenner tonight."}

I stopped in for breakast on my way to Home Delay (Depot, for the uninitiated).  I was in and out in half an hour, and that was all it took to remind me why it's been so long since my last visit.  \"Under New Management\" does not always mean \"Our food doesn't suck anymore.\"

My coffee actually turned grey when I added cream.  I had all-day breakfast, with \"Museum\" sausage - a term borrowed from a neighbour I ran into on my way out - dried and wrinkly, like a mummy.  My eggs over easy had soft, liquid yolks (good) and soft, liquid whites (bad).  Potatoes were tasty, though what else does one expect when they actually ooze butter?  Finally, the rye toast wasn't very flavourful.  Not sure how that happened.

Star #2 is for the service - I was served in a prompt and friendly fashion by the new owner (of about a month).  I'd have cut him more slack on food, but he's also the old owner (he sold the place two years ago, then re-bought it for a tidy profit)."}
{"text":"T'was oK.
Settled for their best burger and fries. Wasn't anything special but it hit the spot.
Not too pricey and for the area it's ok."}
