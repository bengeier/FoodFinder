{"text":"One of my two favorite Mexican places in the Chandler/Gilbert area. Si Senor's and this are the two I go to most. I argue with myself over which I like more, each time I visit one of them..  Palacio has awesome flavor!   That is the review. It is not the spiciest (Si Senor's Spicy Green Chili fills my craving for that) but each and every dish I have had has had great flavor. Their carnitas are my favorite of the meats. It has all the normal Mexican fare, but each just tastes great. I have worked my way all the way through the lunch menu (sharing with family) and have tried a good bit of the entrees. Each has been wonderful. Salsas are all homemade and tasty. I mix the white sauce from the salsa bar with the bean dip they provide to go with my chips..  My go-to is the Queso-dilla burrito, which I order with the queso on the side to avoid cheesemeltdown. I also love the giant taco with chorizo (I forget the actual name?) and the godfather burrito.   I always go home with leftovers because the portions are awesome, servers have always done well, and the atmosphere is fun and colorful.  The one thing I do like over Si Senor's can be seen as a negative, but I find Palacio always to be quieter. There is not always a huge crowd here like at Si Senor's, and it is nice to have a quieter lunch from time to time. Si Senor's is generally loud and packed, and Palacio has the space to enjoy and take your time. Haven't brought my dog to the pet friendly patio yet.. might try that sometime after summer blows past.  Don't let the stars above discourage you from at least trying it. I read through some of the negatives and just disagree or think that someone had a bad day with a server (have gone at least 20+ times over the years and servers have been great). Although to the ones complaining about grease, I will say yes, the fried food and chorizo is greasy. Luckily, I don't go to Mexican places for salad."}
{"text":"My family and I really enjoy this little place. The food is outstanding, the portions are huge, and the prices are reasonable. Sometimes service can be a little slow but the overall experience is worth it. We have and will continue to make this our regular lunch spot."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first and last visit to this restaurant.  A friend had recommend we give it a try, so my wife, mother-in-law, and myself decided we would go on their recommendation.  There were very few cars parked outside the restaurant, which should have tipped me off.  In the end, the service was very slow - not sure why, but they may have simply been understaffed.  The waiter was nice and polite, but we ran out of chips and had to ask to get more, and then had to wait a long time for our check at the end of the meal.  All three of us thought the food was very subpar.  I had cheese enchiladas, which are kinda hard to mess up, but they were dry and had a weird taste.  The rice was not very good, and was also very dry.  The refried beans were the best part of the meal, which my mother-in-law agreed with.  My wife had the vegetable plate, and thought it was passable, but nothing to write home about.  We all gave it a thumbs down and agreed it would not be worth it to come back.  We had just gone to Arriba for mexican food just a few days ago, and found it to be a few steps above El Palacio.  in addition, they do not allow firearms into the restaurant, so if you are a law abiding concealed-carry kind of person, you should know that you are not welcome at this restaurant...another reason for a less then stellar review."}
{"text":"This place is super good, great hot sauces! Very friendly peeps and cold cold beers, the food is amazing! I'm glad my husband and I chose to come here. Thank you for the great service"}
{"text":"Great time!  Caritas stuffed poppers are amazing!  Sit at the bar., watch the game, have a cold beer and poppers.   Roy is great and will take good care of you."}
{"text":"This place has officially made it on my list of places to go while visiting Arizona! You really can't go wrong with mexican food but especially when you have great service! Jesse was our server and he did an awesome job keeping up with us. His service was friendly, prompt and, most importantly, enjoyable. The food was great and the cocktails were even better :) I'd highly recommend this place! Thanks Jesse and El Palacio! I'll be back again soon...hopefully!"}
{"text":"Decent chips and salsa, the free app was a nice touch but way under staffed for a Friday happy hour in the bar. Bartender was swamped and was the only one servicing the large bar area. Food was ok.and prices were not too bad (no food specials for happy hour). Wish there were other local options in the area."}
{"text":"I read most of the reviews, and many of the complaints were service....for us we had no issue....fantastic waiter.  I left him a great tip, despite the food.    The chips and salsa were good, but that was the best part of the meal.  The chile re Leno was awful, enchiladas....tasteless....  Best part of the meal was my son's kids meal.  When you wish you would have ordered a kids meal...I think it says it all.  Will not be returning.."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Our server, Jesse, was absolutely the best server we have had in a very long time. Great food, great service. Amazing atmosphere. I have always enjoyed coming here. Just steer clear of the server with glasses and his hair pulled back in a pony tail that looks like he hasn't washed it in a year."}
{"text":"Love Taco Tuesday, and Kids eat free on Wednesday.  On Tuesdays the mexican beers are cheaper too. There have been multiple weeks where our family has been busy and went two nights in a row. Can't beat the deals.   Their salsa is also high caliber.  The hot stuff is the perfect heat.  I've been told by others that service is slow but I dont think its any different than any other place in the valley.  Taco Tuesdays are jam packed with people too, so be prepared..."}
{"text":"We decided to have our wedding catered by El Palacio and it was such a great choice! The food was ready right when we needed it, they were able to accommodate our vegetarian and vegan guests, and it was so delicious! When we forgot the salad at the restaurant (our fault) they drove it out to us so nobody would have to leave the reception. We received many compliments on the food and it was all due to Anthony and El Palacio Chandler. Thank you for helping to make our wedding day great!"}
{"text":"Let me premise this by saying, I understand everyone can have a bad day and I am huge advocate for giving the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the service industry, but I lost my appetite on this one.  This is by far the worst service I have ever experienced in my life and I have eaten here a few times but only sat in the bar.  The food is amazing but the service was horrific! The hostess let us sit right in front of her for 20 minutes and watching other parties get seated (that came after us), I asked how long for our table, she stated that she sat us already, clearly she didnt we were still in the lobby and sitting less than 5 feet from her.  Once sat, the waiter told us it is going to be a while before he can get to us, the restaurant was far from full.  We went through a basket of chips and a full glass of water for all 4 of us before he even took our drink order where he mentioned again, it is going to be awhile.  He returned 10 minutes later with our drinks ( I watched him walk around aimlessly for several minutes) and told us we could get our own chips at the salsa bar.  He then proceeded to take our order and as we specified what we wanted, interrupted and stated I got it, I got it..... He was very rude and had a condescending attitude with every statement he made to us.  SURPRISE... our orders were wrong and he became defensive... seriously, this is how you treat customers?? I had told him I asked for cheese, he replied, that is the problem?, I will bring you a bucket of cheese.  My son stated I ordered a burrito (same thing he orders every time, never been wrong) and he stated, that is what you got!!! it was more like a chimichanga!!!! I am so appalled at how they treated us, I will not return to this restaurant and will tell everyone I know how horrible the service is!!!!! So disappointed, the food is really good.  They should really be ashamed with the people they hire for being a family owned business!!! We met a family friend who had a horrible experience there and told her it has changed.... boy were we wrong!!"}
{"text":"Go. Get yummy food. Have Matt as your server. Have a fantastic time for a good price. Love it great food great prices great service."}
{"text":"I don't understand why anyone would come here. The food is like frozen entrees that have been microwaved, and then overpriced. The wait staff is inattentive and not overly friendly. With so many Mexican restaurants in the east valley, I'm surprised this one manages to stay in business."}
{"text":"I get the opportunity to travel extensively and I've come here once before and I had the beach dip, that's what brought me back honestly. I came around noon today and it was not really busy. The service was timely and appropriate for a restaurant.  My waiter, Chris was great. He made sure my time here was pleasant even though when I first was seated it was next to the window light which I hate but he quickly got me a good spot. He was very respectful and helpful and it didn't feel tip based which is awesome.  The one draw back is the staff don't seem to have a break area or choose to hang in one area alot. Makes it a bit awkward looking over at someone in uniform and on their phones or doing paperwork.   The food was great, portion sizes are above average. They've also got a cool salsa bar where you can grab as much as you want on top of what's served.   Overall I'd recommend to any visiting the area."}
{"text":"Salsa is really good, especially if you like it hot. Normally restaurants tone down the hot salsa but not here. Food itself is pretty good, we tried the burritos. Atmosphere is authentic. Service is average, friendly."}
{"text":"The food was not good.  I went with my husband and daughter.  We did not like anything we ordered.  It also took 13 mins for someone to greet us at our table."}
{"text":"I discovered this place after trying their tacos at the AZ Taco Festival a few weeks ago. Their street tacos are my favorite!!! Not to mention their salsas are amazing!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We strongly recommend this place to everybody! Great food great service and cold beer! I literally almost always get the Diablo! It's spicy so I only get it if you like spicy food! There are hardshell tacos are awesome and so are their street tacos. Never had anything here we didn't like!"}
{"text":"I worked in Mexican restaurants for 12 years, and have eaten in them for 40.  Yuck!!  The server was nice, and enthusiastic about the food.  I ordered the El Diablo burrito with pork, or something like that - called out as really spicy on the menu.  It was a giant, open ended burrito with sauce that looked suspiciously identical to the salsa served with the chips.  I asked the waitress and she said, \"yes, it is, but it's better because it's like, baked on there\".  The inside had a good amount of day old dried pork chunks, with clumps of uncooked green onions finely chopped, along with raw cilantro in clumps.  It was disgusting, I felt sick for 3 days, and only had two bites!  My sister had a spinach enchilada and relleno plate.  The relleno was soggy, and by the time she got to the spinach enchilada, the lime green colored sauce on top was congealed.  She took one bite and pushed it away.  Will not go back!"}
{"text":"My family and I go here once a month or so. If this review was solely based on the food and cocktails......5 stars hands down!!!!   Sometimes the service is a bit choppy depending on who the server is. However, with that being said, being a server is an extremely hard job and by no means has anyone ever been rude to us. Just a little slow with the service or asking for certain things a few times and them forgetting.   The salsa is the BOMB!!!!! The pork tamales are sweet and moist, the shredded beef tacos are AMAZING! Not to mention.......the dessert.....pffft, of course fried ice cream, DELICIOUS!!!!!  Usually, my husband and I won't order cocktails when out at dinner unless it's a beer or wine because places typically can't make a good, authentic Margarita. I highly suggest you enjoy one of their many Margarita's they have on the menu! They are incredible!   Again, let me clarify that the servers have NEVER been rude or mean to us. I would give 5 stars if some of the servers had better time management, that's all."}
{"text":"This place has the best salsa and bean dip I've ever had.  My husband and I frequently come back for more great food and by now have tried just about everything on the menu.  Our favorites include the el padrino burrito, carne nachos, chicken fajitas, and the seaside delight.  Yum!  In general we share an entree, those delicious chips and dips and leave stuffed.  Average bill for us is usually around $20.  The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because the service is not the best, not terrible but it seems like they are understaffed or under scheduled?"}
{"text":"Been coming here for great Mexican food mostly their menudo.  Their service is awesome and food very good. Their servers are hard working and make dining here even better..ask for Jesse he is one of their best."}
{"text":"The Placeebo By The Rue  I finally checked out El Palacio, I didn't drink but I did eat though,  Chips and salsa and a few tacos, Next time I'll try the desert burrito.  The refried beans are homemade,  Motorhead sings Ace of Spades, My hi-top Vans are made of suede, I had my first kiss in the fifth grade.   Tuesday tacos are just a buck, When you're feeling down on your luck, This place can restore your pluck, \"Cause I'm the nurse who likes to.....\" -Ferris Bueller's Day Off  Get your tortillas in corn or flower, I'm not sure what it's like at happy hour, I'm sure it's anything but dour, Before you come please take a shower.   Como?"}
{"text":"It was really good when they first opened.  The food was good, the service was excellent.  We went back a couple of times after that and both the food and the service went downhill.  Took over a half hour to get to order after being seated the last time. We swore to never return."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Food wasn't great.  Rice and beans were salty, carne asada tasted like it was boiled."}
{"text":"Amazing selection on salsa bar.  If you are with a group do the Bandito! Over 5lbs 28\" burrito!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Mexican food I have ever eaten!  When you arrive you get chips, two tomato based salsas (one mild, one hot) and a bean/meat dip that seriously looks like baby diaper remnants!  The chips are more on the thick side, and the salsa's are a little bland.    I ordered a lunch special with three burritos (all dry-no sauces on top).  One was pork, which was very tough, grizzly and tasted like it had been reheated from the night before.  Then came the machaca burrito.  The machaca was ok, but nothing to write home about.  It did have about 3 strips of peppers and onions in it.  Finally came the bean and cheese burrito.  Not sure how they prepare their beans, but it is just not right!!    I am glad my lunch special was so inexpensive, as I would have been mad if I spent more than the $6 that I did!  I'd recommend skipping this joint and heading to Macayo's or Serrano's if this is the style of mexican food you like!"}
{"text":"The food here did not meet my expectations for Mexican food; I'm being generous with 3 stars. There was every bit of 5 people in the restaurant and the service was still slow.   Excited to see chips and salsa, I immediately took a dive. They bring out 2 salsa's mild & mildly spicy (that's a joke) and a bean dip of sorts (a ladle of their refried beans I'm sure). Whoa Lucy! The bean dip was horribly salty. No bueno.   I tried the shrimp tacos, and for $9  (a la carte) I was quite disappointed. The taco shells had the look and feel of Ortega box shells; I'm sure they were made fresh, but I can't get over how flavorless and grainy they were. The shrimp were hearty though, nice sized.   Our server, well....never mind.  I would LOVE to find a REALLY good Mexican restaurant. It's sad that I've lived here several years and have YET to find one."}
{"text":"Food was below what we would expect for a Mexican restaurant.  All four dishes we ordered were mediocre at best. We went here because it was the only restaurant we could find that had no line on a Saturday night, and trusted the other yelp reviews. After this experience, we will most certainly not return. I presume some of the praise must be from snow birds that are unfamiliar with Mexican food. We knew this place wasnt going to be great , but expected at least a 3..."}
{"text":"Looking for a good Mexican place close to home where we could bring our kids. This place was great! The bean dip was super (my kids loved it) and our food came lightening fast. The pork enchiladas were superb--tender and flavorful. Our waiter was great and even brought us extra chips and salsa to take home with our leftovers. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow, the food here is pretty bad. It tasted like they got it from the freezer section at the grocery store. The service? What service? Our waiter only came to check on us once while we were there, leaving us with empty drinks for a long time. And this was at 3:00 pm, so not like it was busy or anything. There are definitely better choices in this part of town, so this place won't be getting any more of our money."}
{"text":"To start, Chips tasted funny. Couldn't eat them. Almost like they hadn't changed the oil. Which set the tone for lunch. If your oil isn't changed then I can imagine how unsanitary your kitchen is.  Carne Asada, I had to saw through, chile relleno wads lot of breaking that's it. Who puts celery in pick de Gallo??  Yes, the give you bean dip but that doesn't make up for the poor quality of the food. Service was good that is the reason for the one star."}
{"text":"Great Mexican place!  Took our family of four here tonight and ate for under $50.  Love the refillable salsas.  Food and the fried ice cream for dessert was delicious."}
{"text":"Service: Terrible. Margarita's: Terrible. Left before we found anything else to dislike. Tried once when they first opened, didn't like it. Gave it another chance left."}
{"text":"Ok so... I never thought I would give a restaurant only one star. But WTH this was just an CRAP. You walk in and the decor is ok host was pleasant and they had a taco Tuesday special. What could go wrong??? Well... The service was probably the worst we have ever had, I wouldn't feed the tacos to my dog and to top it off the margarita was awful (how the hell do you screw up a margarita? Well ask them lol). Sorry to say run fast run far I would rather have tacos from a guy selling them out of his trunk in Tijuana."}
{"text":"Honestly I have been here many times. The food brings me back not the service. I come in on Thursday nights for $2 tacos. They close at 9pm but have the Salsa bar shut down by 8pm. The server doesn't even ask if you want any toppings on your tacos that only come with meat. The tacos are good. A little too much grease on the tortillas for my taste. They really could put their guest service FIRST and build sales but really NO effort to do so. Just ok is good with them. Disappointing."}
{"text":"If you like uncooked food, watered down salsa and unprofessional rude service this is the place for you.  This place has gone down hill fast.  Bathrooms unclean and restaurant is run down.  Taco Bell is cleaner and has better food and service."}
{"text":"Great experience!! Roy was awesome, made a great suggestion with the godfather burrito.  Food was great and the service was on point.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Placed order to go. 2 beef tacos Ala carte and 1 taco and chili releno. Didn't pay attention when signing cc receipt which is my fault. Got home and tacos were cold as was the chili releno. Wife looked at bank statement this am and was charged $25.00. Looks like they charged us for two 2 item combos. No problem although the combo comes with rice and beans to which we each got MAYBE a table spoon of each. If the tacos were $3.01 each that meant that they charged us appx  $6.00 for 1 small portion of rice and beans 2 times! So, cold entrees and overcharged sides which we didn't order. And they were not cold because of drive time to get home since we live 2 blocks from the restaurant and the order was not ready when I got there so everything should have been hot when I left. Never again!"}
{"text":"Best thing here was the salsa. Bland run of the mill mexican food. You can get the same thing at filebertos for a lot less. Ordered the beef fajitas. No seasoning, very bland FLAT grilled meat. My fault for assuming \"grilled\" meant flame not flat. Condiments include an abundance of sizzling onions with some bell pepper mixed in and a few slices of avocado (no guac), beans and rice and 3 tortillas. The hotter salsa was actually pretty good. Good flavor, nice heat.  Maybe there is better selections to try off their menu but the fajitas were terrible.Service was sparse and slow. Just a dissappointing experience all around."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Had to wait forever for drink refills....that is my only complaint. Overall the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"Crap food / everything with our group was wrong - tasted as if it was fresh from the foiled TV dinner.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"bad service even on a slow night, 30 mins just to get our drink order. No one knew there was an ongoing drink special that was clearly advertised. The manager finally made it happen then hit us with a random higher price, i have no fight left in me for this kind of ordeal. The food was okay. will not return."}
{"text":"I had the shrimp. Delicious. We will be back. The carnitas were excellent. All of the food was authentic spicy and really great.  We will definitely be back.  Oh yes. Great service.  If you like authentic   tasty Mexican I would recommend. ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour today. They always bring two kinds of salsa and bean dip and chips before taking your drink order. They have specials during happy hour and today it was street tacos, margaritas, sangria. The drinks are great for the price. Service was good and the place was nice and clean. Third trip here and the last two times were for drinks and dinner and it's been good everytime."}
{"text":"Waitress was very attentive and friendly. Food not so great.  We brought our dogs and they have an outdoor patio where they were welcome. The reason for the low score is that we did not enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I just got back from El Palacio on Gilbert and Germann and my experience was so horrible that I took the time to make a profile on here just to warn people about this place!   First off the service of HORRIBLE! Our waiter was some rude teenager who didnt give a crap about anything. We decided to try their margaritas. I ordered a raspberry one and my friends ordered a blue and pomegranate one. Out came tiny margaritas that were not rimmed with anything. WHEN DO THEY NOT RIM MARGARITAS!? Mine tasted like frozen jam!   The chips and salsa given to us was extremely salty and had no flavor what so ever. We ordered off the dinner special section which said we would get tortillas and a choice of soup and salad. When the waiter didnt ask my friend which one she wanted she asked for the soup. He said because it was nine the kitchen was already closing up and the soup was already in the freezer. GROSS! were they going to serve it again tomorrow??? And then he said he can reheat it the microwave. EWW what?! When our food came out everything was overlly salted and just crap. Everything was just slopped onto our plates. The rice was hard from being left out and the beans were just mush. My friend was eating his burrito and when he got to the center it was frozen. IS ALL THE FOOD JUST REHEATED AT THIS PLACE!?  I will never ever go back here. It a complete waste of money."}
{"text":"I loved the food here!  You have to have their burrito entree, I think itls called The Godfather burrito, it's so delicious!  The problem with this place 3 out of 4 times i have been there the service is bad!"}
{"text":"The service was great...the food was ok. I have nothing more to say. I wasn't extremely impressed.   This silly thing won't post. I dont like having to add more words to my reviews to get them to post. I believe that some of best messages are brief and to the point. If the business was better, they would've given me more to document.  There was nothing special.....very Vanilla."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and appetizers! I had the nachos and verde vegan salad. However the service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Suprise! I've been there twice and both times, unexpectedly, they gave us a free appetizer and desert! Not sure if this is standard practice or not, but between those 2 freebies and the unlimited chips and salsa, we wound up taking home a lot of our food to eat the next day.  Nice place, good environment, good food, great unexpected freebies. They have earned my return trip(s)."}
{"text":"Roy (behind the bar) is awesome!! We come here often and he's attentive and gives us great suggestions on what we should eat."}
{"text":"El Palacio is by far our favorite local spot. My wife and I, along with friends, dine at least once per week. The food is what you would expect from any good Mexican restaurant, but there are a few standouts. The service is one. Very friendly, fast service, despite the usual large crowd. The second is the chips and salsa. Chips are obviously homemade, served fresh and warm- not chips from a bag like you see in many restaurants. The salsa is home made as well, and REALLY good compared to the tomato sauce  from a can you also get at other restaurants. The tacos are also really good. They load the tacos with your choice of meat- this isn't one of those skimp on the meat and load up on lettuce tacos. We have never been disappointed here and wouldn't eat Mexican food anywhere else in Gilbert."}
{"text":"The food was great and it what are fantastic.  waiters name was Chris and he is best we've seen in a long time."}
{"text":"Always a good meal. I come on Wednesdays for kids eat free. I would give it 5 stars but the service can be slow at times. Overall good value and great food"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times now and every time have left a happy camper. The salsa is really good and if you are one of those guys that has something to prove they have this crazy huge over 2 foot burrito. Good luck on that buddy.  Service and food quality and variety have been consistently good.  Robert Pfeifer"}
{"text":"Have a beer before a movie. Free chips and a variety of salsas is such a nice way to start or end a night. This is a nice place to kick back and relax."}
{"text":"Probably the worst fajitas I've ever had in my life. Hard to mess up fajitas, but they did. The place was exceeding loud/noisy, and the service really slow. However, I gave them three stars because for some reason when we got the bill it was 50% off!  So we got what we paid for! Got to work on those fajitas though..."}
{"text":"Holy cow! We took on the El Bandito burrito. I wasn't expecting the flavors to be that great. Normally when places offer a 28 inch burrito it's more of a gimmick but this was surprisingly good. For 4 or 5 people it's a good hit and a cheap lunch. Can't wait to try more of their dishes. Salsa was outstanding."}
{"text":"We went there twice because of restaurant .com deals. We tried different items both times and none of the 8 we tried were any good. Not terrible, but certainly not good.   The service both times was friendly but very slow. I won't be going back, even though I pass by several times a week."}
{"text":"I don't agree with the negative reviews about this restaurant. However, I think with all Mexican food, it really depends on the person. I am not the kind of person looking for upscale Mexican cuisine, I like cheap Mexican beer, cheap ish Mexican food and a good taco Tuesday. This place has all three.   The quesadilla was the best I've had north of the border. If you are quesadilla purist like me, you will enjoy it too. :) My fiancé was thrilled the chips came  with two salsas and a bean dip!"}
{"text":"OK, First time here and maybe the last. We sat outside which was a little more intimate. Standard chips, salsa, and bean dip was better than average. I ordered the Chile Relleno. The batter was fluffy and the cheese was still semi-solid and flavorless. There was a tomato sauce on top that did anything but complement the already failing dish. I tried my friend's beef enchiladas with red sauce. He said they were dry as in not enough sauce and the sauce tasted bland to me. The beans and rice were a little salty. I am not impressed. Next time I will go to Abuelo's by the Chandler Mall. For a few dollars more I would have actually enjoyed my meal!"}
{"text":"Close to home. Great service and the food isn't the best mexican food I've ever had but it is good. I love the chips and salsa bar and everyone there is so pleasant. Support our local restaurants when you love it!"}
{"text":"Decent place.  Good chips, salsa, and beans to start.  I like their chicken chimis and a few of their burritos.  Can always get a set in the bar area where they have multiple TVs with games on.  Quick service."}
{"text":"Food was average at best, server's people skills were horrible, and food was over priced for the size of the plates."}
{"text":"Had steak chiming this time.  Was very good.  We're with friends  from Canada, who didn't know mexican  food.  They throughly enjoyed their food.  Service was very good.  What was great is that they let dogs on their patio.   You have to try their salsa bar.  I like hot,  there habanero was hot and very tasty.  Definetly  will go back."}
{"text":"Excellent food and even better wait staff! Salsa bar is awesome! Would definitely recommend. I will be going back to try more from their menu!!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed food was cold. Table and seats were dirty. Menu prices didn't match the bill. No flavor in dishes unless you ate the jalapeño' with the seeds. Don't waste your time or money!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch special fish tacos which surprisingly didn't come with rice and beans. I enjoyed them with their salsa bar habanero salsa. Couldn't feel my lips on the way out. The server was very attentive. It was really OK but with so many good mexican restaurants around Chandler it didn't make the cut as anything special."}
{"text":"I gave this place 1 star because of the salsa.  Other than that this was most likely one of the worst places I've eaten...and the service was horrible as well. Frozen, soggy. The rasberry tea had no flavor.  People...really...do not go here!!"}
{"text":"This place needs help.  Our table and the light next to our table were covered in something sticky.  Our server was BAD. He rolled his eyes and laughed when I asked if they have a gluten allergy menu. He was never around to give refills. He didn't even pretend to try to be friendly. When he set the food down he basically threw it on the table. Then he took my plate away while I was still holding my fork and eating rice! He only had us and another table but we had to wait 15 minutes for him to bring us the check after he took our plates. He didn't pick up the check 10 minutes after dropping it off, so I had another server take it to him.  The food wasn't anything special. My friend's fajitas which were supposed to come with avacado had about 1/8th of an avacado on the plate. There were also supposed to be cooked tomatoes in the fajitas, but we couldn't find any. My gluten free tacos were barely enough to fill me up.  Overall I was not impressed, there are plenty of better Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Don't waste your time if you're looking for good food and good service."}
{"text":"Food is terrific...service was terrible. Drinks were made perfectly...if the service had been better I would give this place 5 stars. We got more attention from other servers than our own."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the chips, salsa, and bean dip. My sister and I both got burritos enchilada style.  When we got our food, all we could taste was SALT. Then when we took the leftovers home, my brother in law ate them and found a hard dirt clod in the beans. We will definitely not be back! And to be honest, I wouldn't have even given it one star if I didn't have to."}
{"text":"Stay away! I gave the place three tries but each visit was worse than the one before; horrible service and bad food.   I sat at the bar tonight and it was 5 minutes before a bartender showed up; no one was behind the bar. Once the bartender showed up I ordered a beer. He brought it to me then walked off without asking if I was ready to order (which I was). I watched him converse with other staff members hoping to catch his attention and a few minutes later I did.   I ordered a chicken burrito. The cheese on top was not melted and some of the chicken was luke warm. I only ate about half of it because it was loaded with salt. I still can't get the nasty taste out of my mouth.   Ready to leave, I finished my beer then waited for the bartender who was having a lengthy conversation with other customers. I finally got his attention by waving my arms.  It's obvious that management is lacking in their ability to manage as this lack of service and bad food was a repeat of my two other visits. Needless to say I will not be back.  Save your money and eat at Taco Bell. The food and service will be much better."}
{"text":"I'm from California and know what good Mexican food is and this not the place. I'm huge when it comes to beans because I love bean and cheese burritos but I wasn't a fan of theirs. They give you beans with your chips and salsa in the beginning and those beans are different from the beans that they put in the burrito. They tasted like Rosarita beans and the beans in my burrito tasted bland and it was really watered down. Wouldn't recommend this place to someone. Good beans at a Mexican place is essential honestly."}
{"text":"Yummy everything, except the guacamole was a bit bland...maybe it was just the avocado that was used though, try it!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and had great food/service. We ate in the bar area last night and had the worst service/food ever. My margarita was served to me in a dirty glass to start. I was drinking it and it stunk. I then realized there was gunk around the rim under the margarita salt. Next, I order the carnitas rancheras and my husband gets the sopa del mar. I never get my albondigas (choice of soup or salad). I had to ask for it when my meal came out. Then I had to ask again for a spoon. Then I had to ask for the guacamole and corn tortillas that came with the meal! My husband ordered a very expensive soup. He didn't finish it after he ate the seafood out of it. He said it tasted like veg beef broth with seafood thrown in. Nobody ever asked how our meal was or sent a manager to our table. They gave us our bill and sent us on our way. I tipped the server not because of the service, but because I used to be a server and understand that's pretty much all they get. Mind you we have eaten there 5 other times with no problem, but I do believe this will affect us going back any other night other than taco Tuesday. :("}
{"text":"Here for taco tuesday and truly disappointed.  Tacos are extremely greasy and lack flavor.  I have been coming here for a few years and the qualify is not there."}
{"text":"My mother and law and I were hoping for a salad in a tortilla bowl. We asked our server if they offered that, and he pointed out the salad page. Again, I asked him if all if these salads come in a fried, flour tortilla bowl, and he said yes. I ordered the enchilada salad and it did not come in a tortilla bowl. But it was an interesting tasting salad, pretty basic lettuce, carrot pieces, celery, grated cheese, but it had a cheese enchiladas on top that had been dipped in a delicious red sauce. My mil had the vegan platter. She said the veggies-squash, zucchini, onion-where pretty tasteless and there were frozen peas and carrots mixed in the white rice she did not like that. The server did offer to bring her something else but she declined. She did enjoy the pinto beans that were served on the side. This place is close to my home but it's not the best Mexican food I've had."}
{"text":"Great taste.  Good service!  Good portions.  Beans and salsa are gr8.   The God father burrito is big.  Could easily share.  Quick turn around.  We came Thursday night."}
{"text":"Finally a Mexican restaurant with Mexican food made the right way. Folks this is Tex-Mex, not the CA Mexican food like Z-Tejas serves (YUCK).  The fajitas are to die for and the portions very generous. We eat there about once a week. Seated quickly, great service and friendly staff. The negative reviews must be coming from competitors or friends of competitors because they are absolutely false unless you are a California fish taco kind of person. Seriously!"}
{"text":"I have had this restaurant cater three different events in the past year. The price is so reasonable and their food is a big hit. My order has always been hot and ready on time. I will defiantly continue to use this place when I have a large number of people to feed."}
{"text":"This place is not very good. It's never busy, and the food doesn't compare with many of the other places. But they make a good margarita. To be honest, with the location, I'm surprised they haven't been bought out as it's a prime location for a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Our favorite local restaurant! Roy at the bar makes you feel welcomed, remembers your drinks, and always happy to recommend a dish based on your preferences or dietary needs.  Jacob is always there. Attentive, friendly, knowledgable and anticipates your needs! The food is always delicious! Try the enchilada with the sunny side egg-beyond words!!! Taco Tuesday? Taco Thursday is amazing!!!   We always recommend EP to all our friends and usually have another family with us at least once a week! Great service and tonight with Jacob was no different! I can't say enough about this place! Come join us and challenge us at Buzztime trivia. Loser buys next round?"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and the food was great .  My shrimp burrito and side of beans/rice were delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chandler. HUGE menu with a variety of Mexican dishes. I've been there several times and always had delicious food and great service. All the homestyle chips and salsa you want, too."}
{"text":"Good traditional Mexican restaurant with lots of choices! Good salsa (two kinds) and beans with the chips! Friendly bartender too!"}
{"text":"While visiting this place for our first time, my husband and I were looking it up on yelp. While alot of the reviews were not good, we wanted to give it a chance. The service was extremely slow on a not so busy day and the food is tasteless and mine was lukewarm.  We gave it a try but won't be back."}
{"text":"This was one of the better Mexican food restaurants I've been to in Phoenix.  We did go on Monday (when they first opened) so the service was kinda \"meh\".  However, the food was very good.  This is Mexican food, not TexMex.  It's not like Valle Luna (which is good that they aren't).  It's been rough finding GOOD Mexican food in the Phoenix area.  mmm Chips and dip... their salsas were really good... not full of vinegar.  Their \"hot\" has good flavor, but isn't so hot you can't eat it.  Bean dip was REALLY good too!  Their chips were good and weren't oily either.    They have a **H U G E** menu...  The Carne Asada was really good!  It's a sirloin steak topped with green chiles. Garnished with guacamole. Served with chile relleno.  Probably one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  My wife got the spinach and cheese enchilada verde.  It came out with 2 friends... (3 of them). They have their special sour cream (onion flavored).  It was very good too!"}
{"text":"When I go into a Mexican restaurant, I first look to see if they have good combination platters for lunch and dinner.  I have to say, my first impression was not that good.  I thought their menu wasn't the greatest.  I believe I had the chimichanga and that I had a stomach ache afterwards.  My waiter was fine but I witnessed the manager having some sort of negative exchange with him.  I hate that. I do not want to hear somebody yelling or openly criticizing someone else when I am trying to enjoy my meal.  Its a real turn off."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice and both times we were absolutely delighted! The wait staff was excellent and the food was fantastic! I have only tried the burritos and these are HUGE! One burrito fills up the plate for just $9.95. The first time I tried the house special burrito with large chunks of juicy steak along with spicy jalapenos and onions with a zesty sauce. The second time I tried the carnitas burrito. It was AWESOME!   I recommend that you order sour cream as a side for your burrito and bear in mind that this is the traditional Mexican \"crema\" and not the kind of sour cream you and I get at the store. I have to say that the food was delicious both times and that the service was impeccable both times. My favorite so far is the carnitas burrito with green sauce. It is the traditional slow roasted pork with jalapenos, onions and other peppers. It is spicy! Try it! You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"First time here and it's Taco Tuesday! Great drink specials and great food! We ordered the carnitas nachos, three tacos and my hubby had a house margarita. The nachos were good, and the tacos were amazing.  The house margarita wasn't bad either. We enjoyed this place and our server was very nice and helpful. We will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"My rating of five stars is not for the food, it is for the customer service that Ray gave my friend and I. We stopped in today and walked into an empty restaurant. I ordered the seafood chimi which was not so great when it came to the table. Obviously Ray was paying attention to us because he ended up comping our entire meal when we were done. I just want to thank him for being so kind and offering his apologies for the food mishap. Way to go Ray, I may just give El Palacio a second chance some time!"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER! Sat at the bar thinking it would be good service for happy hour..... WRONG.. Took 7 minutes to get my first beer, 6 mins. to get second one and over 10 minutes to get the bill. The bar tender was too busy talking to customers in the dining area to serve the Bar. Totally offensive environment and lack of customer care, next time I will cross the street and go to  chili's."}
{"text":"First time I have reviewed à restaurant....this place was way below par. Chili relleno had hardly a chili and was covered in a thick cornmeal batter. It was gross...slow service, took over an hour for dinner ....will not be back."}
{"text":"Nope! Keep on looking if you want good food this is not for you. It looks nice and it's clean but food not worth stopping for. I take it back the dip was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place was overall disappointing. My husband went with me, along with his parents for a dinner about 3-4 weeks ago. With the prices, I expected it to be of Tia Rosa's quality, but it fell flat. The sour cream was not normal, and the tortilla soup was basically chicken and vegetable broth (I have never seen large chunks of celery, along with peas and green beans before in tortilla soup) with strips of tortillas on top.   The waiters were horrible! We had to get the attention of him twice, and the man who brought our food was practically throwing the plates on our table- I'm guessing because the plates were too hot. He almost made a plate full of food fall on my father-in-law's lap, but barely caught it in time. My drink was empty twice for more than 3-5 minutes; also, I asked for sour cream, and after 7-10 minutes of not receiving it AND not having our waiter stop by, my father-in-law finally got up and went across the room to grab another waiter.  The value of the whole night felt less simply because of the bad service, and I had high hopes for a new restaurant in a packed plaza which were washed away with my experience. With so much competition, this place should really be on top of their game, but is not.  .  Overall, the food was sub-par and service not great. Just a \"meh\" place. I'd much rather pay $4 more pp and go to Cantina Laredo or Tia Rosa's."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place since it's so close to home and I love a good Cadillac margarita and some Mexican food.   Service took a while for us to even get menus, we were there about 5pm on a Saturday, it was not busy. The chips and salsa they give are pretty bland. The salsa didn't have much taste. I ordered ground beef enchiladas and instead was given shredded beef. The margarita was standard, I asked for Patron instead of the house tequila. I'm not sure that's what I was given because I wasn't upcharged for the Patron. Seems the lack of attention to detail by the servers is common as I overheard some mistakes at the table behind us also. We had to ask for a drink menu and the drink menu only lists beer and tequila.   Overall it was sub par. I don't think I would return."}
{"text":"Just my girls and me on a weeknight and it was a nice experience.  All of us on special diets, gluten free, high protein, etc. The waitstaff helped us navigate the items, all if which turned out yunny.  Also, with or complicated orders, the waiter took or order with no pen and everything was spot on.  The food was delivered quickly too.  Since there were a few open tables on a weeknight, we continued on chatting, and they didn't mind, just kept offering drinks.  Entirely non rushed, laid back, just like it should be.  Waiter support pleasant."}
{"text":"We have eaten plenty of times and really like this place. They have a salsa bar which is cool and great bean dip ( included- not a menu item). I really like their green chili and my wife likes the shredded beef chimi. They serve up a lot of food and the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Love mexican food. The good things here were few waitress was great. Great attitude  and helpful. Chips and salsa very good. The rest not so much. The greeter had attitude. One of the worst chimis ever. Wife had arroz con pollo. Our dog seemed to like it. For the prices seems they could afford to put a filling in tortillas. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I am super picky of Mexican restaurants. I was spoiled growing up in Southern, AZ.    This is a decent spot, with nice ambiance. The service is good. Staff has rotated a little bit over the past year, but they maintain. The selection is normal. Plenty to drink. Food could be better."}
{"text":"Highlights:  * Fajitas * Spicy salsa  * Warm thin chips * Guacamole in tostada shell   The whole family loved it and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Update:  still one of my favorite Mexican food places to eat.  They added a salsa bar and really have a great selection of fresh and interesting salsas.  Lots of new lunch specials if you order before 3."}
{"text":"Overall just not that great.  I got the fajitas and was not impressed.  Service was slow even though they only had about 3 tables to wait on.  I won't be going back - wish there was better Mexican food in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Free vegie app that was very good. Best bean dip I have had so far in phoenix. Other two salsa were nice and fresh. The hot salsa was subtle and nice not brutal. Could be a little cleaner. The picante and shrimp burritos were both good and the rice and refried beans were also fresh and good. More heat is needed."}
{"text":"The lunch machaca chimi was good."}
{"text":"I own a restaurant and I feel HORRIBLE for the owner of this restaurant. Do you know that KIDS are running your place and treating customers terribly? We came in 1 hr before closing. We just left at 9:07 and closing time was 9. I saw on the door as we left. We got no chips and salsa until we asked for it. Water, we asked twice. The waiter showed his face at our table very rarely. The food was cold and not good. We were the last ones in the place and I KNOW the workers could hear us making remarks about how this is every Yelper's dream come true. (Remember I am a restaurant owner. I NEVER leave a bad review for a restaurant because of that.) They never said a word to us, never apologized for the bad service. They don't care. If you own this place and you are reading this, I would fire every person closing tonight."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Food was ok but nothing special. Had the Carne Asada, it was over cooked with a wilted green onion draped over it. Soups were ok I had the Abondogas and my husband had the chicken tortilla , we've had better at local Mexican places. All in all not impressed. Better places around for a great Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Third time visiting and the food is good and had decent service in the bar. However when my girlfriends and I went to the Restroom we witnessed an employee use the potty and return to work without washing her hands. There was also hand sanitizer readily available at the door which was also ignored. This grosses me out so now I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Gilbert! We try to always sit in the bar area, as Roy makes the best margarita around!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite day date place with my wife. We brought uncle and his lady and they love it."}
{"text":"This place is getting better.  Only big issue is the waiters and waitresses don't refill your drinks and when you ask they sigh and are reluctant. Other than that it's very good.  Fajitas are sizzling when they come out."}
{"text":"Took about 45 minutes to get some really generic food. Our waiter was inattentive as well.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Great service! The food came out fast, they brought out chips and salsa right away and refilled it without us even asking for more!They brought out three different dips and they were all delicious! Loved the variety rather than just one traditional house made salsa like other restaurants. The waiter was nice and refilled drinks promptly and got us everything we needed! The food was delicious! I got carne asada tacos that were very flavorful, but a little messy! Their guac was good too but the tacos only came with a really small portion of it :( they also brought out a small desert after for us to try!! Free! :) they had a lot of wonderful desert toppings// some topped with liqueur ;) will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm picky about my Mexican food the steak Mexican was good. But didn't like some of the salsas or the red or green chile. Let's just say I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"The place itself is pretty cozy and inviting. The price ... It's decent. You can get a meal complete with water, chips and salsa, and a main dish for approximately 20.00 (tax and tip included).  We dined on a Monday. The bar area was busy, the main dining area had bout ten diners (excluding my party).   We were seated promptly, chips and salsa was served timely as well... And it just went down hill from there! :/  Service was very sloooow! It seems that the restaurant was very short staffed. Our meals did not arrived for nearly 40 mins, and we waited another 20 mins for our tab. Once we received it, we hand to wait for another 20 mins for someone to help us pay our tab."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The bartenders and food are excellent.  My only gripe with this place is that every time, and I mean EVERY time I have eaten in the dinning room, I have had horrible service.  The food is still fantastic, but the service goes right out the door along with my patience...  So my advice, sit at the bar or at one of the tables in the bar.  They are in the process of builidng an outside patio, I PRAY that the service is like the bar so I will be able to enjoy the outside this winter, but seeing that it is connected to the dining room... my hopes are very low."}
{"text":"Lets start with the service. HORRIBLE! Slow and not personable. The food was just OK also. Seemed like a dead place for having such good reviews on Yelp.  Don't think I will ever go there again."}
{"text":"Fish tacos were awesome especially with two fried eggs over medium...customers from outside of town visiting on business also enjoyed the food there!"}
{"text":"Oh. Well. This was...disappointing.  I love Mexican food, it's one of my favorites so when I saw this place so close to my house I ridiculously ignored the poor reviews because salsa was calling my name. i bit.  Went in and it wasn't very busy for a Friday night. Shouldn't have ignored that fact. We had a very nice waiter, he didn't have much to work with so I pity him a little. He wasn't fast, but he wasn't slow. He was very accommodating, too.  It was the food. The TV's all over the place really aren't what I want to see when I'm trying to have dinner. All the diner's faces were turned to it. Weird.  Anyway. Ordered our drinks. The margaritas were tasteless. I mean NO taste. I added Grand Marnier to help it out when what I should have done was the shot of GM and ignored the sort of frozen icy thing without taste in front of me. My daughter-in-law ordered a strawberry one and liked it, but I refused to taste it. If anything was going to kill the rest of my taste buds it was going to be the food. Success!  Ordered the cheese crisp which was okay. Not terrible. I need to add they have a salsa bar, too. The regular pico de gallo was pretty okay, but you run out of chips and can't eat the salsa. Anyway.  I ordered the carne asada fajitas with the hope that the meat would be fatty and delicious. Instead it had zero fat on it and tasted like chalk. Meaty chalk. Don't imagine it, it isn't pretty. It had onions as vegetables. And like two pieces of squash. I would have liked bell peppers, but okay. I also had tortillas that were disgusting. I've had better from the dollar store. Are they just buying the cheapest everything for this place? It's really bad.  My family did not like their food either. I'm not going to go through it, just read above. Same reaction.  Unfortunately this just isn't a good place for Mexican. I'm so disappointed."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. The chips and salsa are very fresh. Everything i order i love. The salads are great. Would reccommend highly."}
{"text":"Well, it used to be Long Horn steak house. So hey new Mexican place. Tried it out for dinner the other night. The menu is pretty much what you expect from typical Mexican joint. Nothing interesting besides your typical Mexican fare. Got the complementary chips. They are alright, on the salty side. I ordered a dish of pork with green chile (the name escapes me at the moment). It came with soup. Your standard veggie soup really. Whoa, horribly over salted. Same comment from the gf. With my entree it's not bad, and once again OVER SALTED. It's like the cook over salts every single item on the menu! OMG! And I love salty food! I crave salt! I typically eat stuff more saltier than most people. But yikes! I couldn't even take that! They need to fix that ASAP. A lot less salt and it'll be an OK Mexican place. I think I'll go to Abuelo's instead."}
{"text":"Good effort decorating, reminds me of an old dingy Chili's restaurant. It was super dark during the day. What I did like was that they have a complimentary salsa/chip bar during lunch, they have really good enchiladas but do not get the chile relleno, the salad was bland and the tortilla soup was old. My bf ordered a chimi and although it wasn't greasy and gross the options for meat were gross, we're talking chicken, ground beef (?) and machaca. If you are looking for authentic Mexican, definitely don't recommend it, but if u r looking to drink and have some appetizers than definitely."}
{"text":"Expected much much more.  Disappointed on a few things. Salsa taste old and rice was unpleasant."}
{"text":"Bartender mike was great!  Food was great! The bean dip was a nice touch!  Friendly staff"}
{"text":"I've read some of the reviews and am not surprised at some of the harsh comments, the truth is they are well deserved. We've been hear twice, the first time during their first month of being open which offered slow chaotic service, bland food and staff that seemed really put out to be helping us. After this experience we knew we didn't want to go back.   Fast forward to the day before Thanksgiving 2013, after a busy afternoon and a taste for Mexican we agreed that surely after all this time they've gotten over their opening problems. Nope! Still just as bland, chaotic and full of staff that seemed unhappy to have to serve us.   When they first opened we were excited to have a full service Mexican restaurant nearby, now as we drive by it daily it's a sore reminder of what could have been. We find ourselves missing Longhorns Steakhouse that used to be there."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the one in Kingman, the food seemed the same, but the atmosphere at this one is much better.  Overall, its pretty good, I had the El Padrino, its kind of like beef fajitas rolled into a burrito with cheese on top...My wife had the Mexican Flag, I didn't try it, but she said it was also good.  They bring huge glasses for your soda, or water, or whatever, this I love as I tend to drink a lot, then have to wait for the server to refill my glass.  Before your meal they bring out beans, and two kinds of sauce, a hot and a mild.  The beans were OK, the mild sauce was a little sweat, and the hot sauce, while not that hot, had a good flavor.  We also tried their Creme Brulee, again pretty good.  On top of these things was the service, very very good, which to me is a huge part of the meal.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Salsa and bean dip were yummy and the margaritas were awesome! I has the child rellano and it was good and flavorful. The chips are sooo good and hit when they bring them out and the service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Horrible. First we were sat at a dirty table, with dirty silverware. After asking twice for a high chair, we ended up just getting it ourselves. There was no soap in the bathroom to wash our hands, therefore staff are not washing their hands. The hostess was fighting with a server about where she was going to seat the guests because the server wanted more tables in his section (very loudly in front of customers). A busser was popping his pimples on the way back to the kitchen. Just all around very unsanitary and unprofessional atmosphere at this place. Then we got the food, which we could not even eat. It was nasty, and we were honestly afraid to get sick. We paid for food we didn't dare touch, then picked up drive through on the way home. Disjointing, to say the least."}
{"text":"Love coming here! We come every Tuesday for taco Tuesday! They have great specials and AMAZING drinks! The machaca and shrimp tacos are delicious and they cater to my gluten-free diet! It's nice to have a bartender (Roy) who knows what liquor is gluten free and what isn't. I've been to a few bars and their bartenders have no clue... The atmosphere is good they have the game on and you can play trivia games. We always have a good time. I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed and sadden by today's visit.  Today was my husband birthday so we decided to try something new with his family. It wasn't busy, but clearly short staff. We were still being optimistic, but one thing kept happening after another. The food wasn't the best or at lease to my likings but I can respect that in resturaunts. Heck that's the whole point of trying new places. But what saddens me was the customer services. It literally took 2 hours to get our food. (Sat down at 6:30, didn't get our food close to 8:15pm) When I personally got my Mexican pizza it was soggy, and I found hard vegitable stems in my food. We didn't eat it. We still kept quite but  we asked to talk to the manager.  That took literally 20 mins for the manager to come talk to us. My husband was respectful and expressed his concerns. This has been the first time we refused to pay our bill for any restaurant especially since we didn't really eat it. We would have been gladly paid for the drinks but the manager agreed that we didn't have to and apologize. However as we were getting up to leave quietly, the waiter Martin decided to yell at us that we were lying. That didn't sit well to my sister in law so she responded to his comments. Sadly to say The manager got in between them. Again it was my husband birthday. We weren't looking for a free meal, just a nice dinner with family. We got our of there at 9:15pm. Way pass what I was expecting and my kids bed times. This place needs a re-education in customer services 101 or be Restuarant rescue or something! Why the waiter felt the need to retaliate is beyond me. Be accountable for your actions and understand the true meaning of what customer service is. If you can't perform and feel the need to tell off customers, find a different job. Martin -I hope nothing for the best of you, because it appears whatever you are going through at this time of life you felt the need to take it out on the wrong people. I would give this place no stars of I could, and hope the following customers don't go through what we did."}
{"text":"The website talked about lots of vegetarian options but at the restaurant the waiter was rude when asked about them,  and it almost felt he wanted to dissuade us from eating there. Overall a terrible experience and dissapointment. Will not go back here."}
{"text":"We went to El Palacio on Tuesday hoping they had a Taco Tuesday special. We sat in the bar area and had great service along with some really good tacos that were normal size and not smaller just for Taco Tuesday like some other places. Yes they do have a special on tacos, don't quote me but I think they were a dollar or two each. The Margaritas were also good. Definitely worth it!  2/2018 they are now out of business!"}
{"text":"Metro Phoenix is a tough place for Mexican restaurants.   The level of Mexican food in AZ is very high and because of that, I find that my expectations are raised of any restaurant.   Palacio is primarily designed for groups of 4 or less. Lots of booths and not that many tables that can handle more.  My family of 6 showed up and waited for nearly an hour, granted on a busy night.  Lots of booths were available, but alas, we simply would not fit.   Once seated, the service was prompt and very good.   The chips and salsa had decent chips, but really good mild salsa and very good bean dip.   The chimichangas ordered had some of the best deep fried flaky crust I've had. The seafood filling was a lot of imitation crab, sort of a turn off.  The carne asada was ok, I've had tastier before.   My wife's chile relleno was a complete disappointment.  The breading was way to thick and overwhelming and made the poor chile inside look sad.   I have always thought that restaurants should resist the temptation to fill their menu with items they think they should have rather than items that they do really well.  Palacio's chile relleno is a good example of that.   In the end, this is ok Mexican food in an area that is rife with great restaurants."}
{"text":"I like this place a little more everytime I go there. On Mondays they have killer margarita specials and on Tuesdays they have $1 tacos. I'm not talking about crappy dollar tacos that you get at Taco Bell neither, these are delicious, crispy and loaded with goodness. The machaca are my favorite but they are all really good. They bring you chips and salsa with bean dip as soon as you sit down. Their hot salsa is really good and the chips are nice and hot when they come out. This is gonna be one of my new hangouts as they have NTN trivia, reallly cool bartenders, great food and they are close to my house. Score!"}
{"text":"I pass by this location everyday and finally decided to stop by and I am so happy I did! Literally the best street tacos I have ever ate. They are full of large portions of juicy meat!! Very kid friendly, I was surprised at the large number of families that were in the restaurant while we were in there. I will def be going back!!"}
{"text":"I liked their service it was fast, friendly and courteous. The street tacos were delicious, The atmosphere is quiet comfortable. I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Came in for first try - don't really see a reason to return.  Half empty restaurant on what should have been a busy time should have been a clue.   Sat quickly, salsa and bean dip solid, waiter had a lot of tables so not sure if understaffed \"again the now hiring sign on the restroom door might have been a clue\".  Food was fast for sure but quality marginal.   Had a combo plate, chili relleno had a thick batter around, chicken enchilada was good, Pork tamale was inedible.  Waiter said yeah, I know I should have warned you, got me a replacement taco (reason for 1 of the stars \" that was kind of  greasy.   Girlfriends salad was ok \"and I think every man knows there is more to the story when we hear ok or fine .   Maybe a good spot for kids due to speed or beers and chips at bar but not a high quality Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Went again for Mother's Day dinner. My GF wanted Mexican food so we went here.  Again, nothing special about the food or service; mediocre at best, but convenient for us since we live close by.  Drinks like strawberry margaritas are expensive, but beers are average in cost.  We had the old standby dinner -- rice and beans, and enchiladas -- cheese, chicken, and machaca."}
{"text":"The food is just okay but the service was amazing at my last visit and so I'm giving it a \"4.\" This is a reliable place with food the whole family likes, with the kids often being the deciding factor. [Don't go here if you're a foodie, though.] The patio is dog friendly and you still get good service which is unusual at many restaurants where you are forgotten out there unless the patio is packed. Lauren was our waitress and she really goes above and beyond plus has a friendly yet sassy attitude that I loved!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Server was kind of rude not friendly at all and didn't tell us his name. We ordered a tostada (no meat) $7, and a mini shredded beef chimichanga with rice and beans $8. The chimi was not deep fried and the server kept saying yes it was. Over all the food was just ok, the service was not great, and we probably won't be going back for lunch."}
{"text":"The restaurant is near my home, and I love Mexican food. Unfortunately, the service is very poor. I found my waiter to be rather unfriendly, unhelpful, and slow. The food was average at best. If you're just looking for a couple of drinks, the bartender is also slow and unresponsive.  I have tried several times and now am putting up the white flag. They'll not get any more of my money."}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant tonight because the place we were headed to was closed and I'm so glad we did! Our waitress, Lauren, recommended the Going Green Veggie Soft Tacos for vegetarian fare but there were several other interesting and different vegetarian options, ... which means we'll be back! It's rare to find anything other than the old standards, and if you also want healthy food, good luck. The Going Green Veggie Soft Tacos delivered a perfect blend of crunchy vegetables, sauteed spinach, and gooey cheese (but not too much) with lots of lettuce and tomato on spinach tortillas. Really, really yummy! Service was fast and friendly, prices fair, and there was enough of hubby's chicken burro to bring home for tomorrow's lunch.   The variety of salsas gives everyone something to like; my favorite was the fresh pico de gallo."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try a new Mexican restaurant and this was our choice! We loved it!! The Bean dip, chips and salsa were great! We had an awesome waitress (she did say she was new) but fantastic job!! The refried beans were authentic, husband loved the rice too!! The meals were a bit salty for my taste, but otherwise amazing and we will most certainly return!!"}
{"text":"This was overall a disappointing experience.  For a Friday night, the place was not very busy which we should have taken as a sign.  The service was extremely slow and inattentive.  Our waitress was never on the floor, we had to ask other people to find her.  We ordered steak fajitas.  They too were disappointing.  The vegetables were almost pickled and not charred like you expect with fajitas.  The meat was tough and tasteless.    Too many good choices around to bother giving this place another chance.  Guess I was right.  I drove by the other day and it is closed down."}
{"text":"ONLY good thing about this place is the salsa.... Entrees are nasty."}
{"text":"We had attended a Chef Off event here between the El Palacio owner/chef and Romeo from Romeo's Euro Cafe.  The food was amazing on both sides and their salsa was memorable.   A few months later we returned for lunch are were equally impressed. The complimentary chips, 2 kinds of delicious salsa and a creamy bean dip were so good and went fast. We ordered from the lunch menu and the portions were giant. My husband got the steak sandwich with inions and peppers which was really like a giant fajita on a bun. Very tender and tasty for about $9!  I got the Mexican flag plate with a side of rice and beans. Serious yum! Perfectly cooked enchiladas with nice seasoned meat which I couldn't even get close to finishing. Thank you El Palacio for staying true to Mexican cooking without swimming in grease. Excellent service and the waiter was very nice. We will be back and tell all our friends."}
{"text":"This place has the best chips and salsa in the valley.  Be careful not to fill up of the beans that they give you too!  Lots of flavorful food and a great place to go with the family!   So sad that it is closing!"}
{"text":"It's just not good Mexican food at all. The only way you get good service is to sit at the bar. We still go there to sit at the bar, drink and play trivia, but not for the salsa, cold chips, cold bean dip and blah food.  Unfortunately I can't recommend a better Mexican food place around here either."}
{"text":"They have great deal on taco Tuesday. It's $1 per taco. I bring all my kids for the night so I don't have to cook. Their salsa bar is pretty good too."}
{"text":"So far great service, checked in on yelp and got a free appetizer!!! Chips and salsa with the bean dip is delicious.  Ordered the street tacos and menudo, all I can say is I love this place and will be back. ALL THE FOOD WAS AMAZING. No description needed"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday with a friend.   We had a great experience - first of all, our waiter was one of the best I have ever had in my life!!  He was there when we needed him and so pleasant and knowledgeable. The salsas, bean dip and chips are the best in Phoenix (and believe me I have sampled more than a few) I had the Tostada Compuesta which was superb, really nice greens and very crispy corn tortilla - fresh - served w guacamole.  My friend had the carnitas salad and she was most pleased. Finally I have found a Mexican restaurant that has a nice atmosphere with top food and some native dishes - not just the formula chain stuff that is everywhere.  The menu is extensive so you have a lot of choice.   I can't wait to go back. I LOVED this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place.   It's nice to sit back, play trivia, have a drink and have chips and salsa.  My favorite is the chips and bean dip.  The pork and sour cream is so yummy!   Roy the bartender/Manager takes good care of us and remembers what we like with food and drinks so half the time we don't even need a menu.   Everyone is always nice to us whenever we come."}
{"text":"I am all about trying new mexican restaurants since it is pretty much my favorite type of food. So I decided to try this new place that I had seen while shopping in Chandler. When we walked in on a Saturday afternoon, the restaurant was surprisingly close to empty. Not a very good sign considering that several other places that were in this building before had gone out of business. In any event, I was still excited after reading that they actually served you bean dip with your chips and salsa. Not too many other places do that. My excitement went down the drain when the bean dip came. It was greasy and resembled chili. The taste was not what I had expected. Needless to say, I didn't like it much. If you want great bean dip, go to Serranos! Theirs is amazing. However, the mild salsa was pretty good. For my meal, I decided to order the pork enchilada with ranchera sauce (the waiter said the ranchera sauce was great) with a pork tamale and rice and beans. The enchilada was ok but didnt have enough ranchero sauce. I like my mexican food to be smothered in sauce. GO BIG OR GO HOME! The tamale was nothing memorable. What also bothered me is the beans that were on the plate were exactly the same beans as the bean dip that I disliked. WTF? There is a difference between regular good ole refried beans and bean dip!!! The worst part about my meal is that there was a hair on the plate! The husband ordered a chimichanga with shredded beef. He said it was decent but was not happy with the tiny amount of sour cream and guac they gave him. They also pretty much piled lettuce on the plate. I understand most mexican places use lettuce as a garnish but this one had way too much. It looked like a salad topped with a chimichanga. To end our meal, the waiter brought us 2 complementary fruititas which were wonton wrappers filled with a mixture of fruit, deep fried and topped with sugar and cinnamon and accompanied by whipped cream to dip. These were the best part of the meal I would say. They were amazing. If I had to come back, I would just order these and these only!!!  So to wrap it up, El Palacio was ok, not good, not bad. The service was fine and the prices were decent. My issue is that there are sooo many other mexican places in the area that are great in my opinion. Therefore, I dont think I would return here unless someone else wanted to try it. I will just stick to Serrano's, Abuelos, El Charro or even McCayos."}
{"text":"Interested in visiting a new-ish Mexican restaurant in Gilbert? GO FAST, because this place won't be around long.   As other have described, the pros are that it's decently priced, you do get chips and salsa pretty quickly and the busser/chips guy was totally on top of his gig. No problems with the other servers/staff... pretty non-descript.  Here's the problem... the stuff you go to find at a Mexican restaurant- margaritas, enchiladas, great sauces, etc., none of that was any good. The margarita tasted like something served at an 18 year old's frat party: no balance, cheap tequila and the best part, the \"rocks\" were pretty much non-existent and/or melted in the first 10 minutes. How can that happen? My wife got something to the effect of \"Mexican Flag,\" which was supposed to be three enchiladas. Not a single one was good to either of us. The sauces were not even Las Palmas quality and the filling was pretty scarce. Waste of $10. By the way- that's the entrée the waitress \"LOVES.\" Yikes.   We live 2 miles away and have decided that was our one and only trip there... Hopefully, they can turn it around and re-attract some people. Lots of houses being built around there - they could have a chance to save themselves...."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and great service. Drinks, chips, and appetizers at the bar. Roy is an awesome bartender. Tacos were amazing. Felt like we were home. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Our server was new and was hardly around despite the place not being very busy. I had the Mexican Flag (a popular lunch item per the server) and it left much to be desired. The salsa was decent and chips were warm. All told, we probably won't be going back for a second time."}
{"text":"Be sure to sit in the bar area  - JACOB is our favorite Server & Bartender! There's high tops & Botha too & kids can be here. This place has the icy-est cold beers in town!!! We love this place, excellent food too, great bean dip & salsa bar! Family owned which is a good thing, Only 1 in the valley & 2 others in Bullhead City & Laughlin I think...we've been coming here so long I forgot the whole story. We love supporting or local Gilbert businesses! Lots of text deals plus check-in & kiosk sign-in deals! Great food & did we say ICE-COLD BEERS!!!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We have been going there for years, and have always been happy. This last time it Took forever for someone to get us drinks.  Then when we asked the hostess if someone could get our drink order the waiter/bartender said from across the room was because he had to hand squeeze the drinks. Someone else's drinks we just wanted ice tea. Of course other people are looking at us. Then he takes the people who just came in their order. Are you serious. The food was good, but when he comes to give us our bill there is lettuce and cheese all over it. OMG that guy needs a rest or something. Needless to say if it continues to be like that we will stop visiting."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I love their happy hour - you get a little appetizer on the house as well as a little dessert at the end!  The bean dip and salsa are AWESOME.  The sangria is VERY good, although it is a little too sweet sometimes.  Everything I've ordered here has always been delicious.    Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service can be kind of slow/spotty at times.  Otherwise I love me some El Palacio."}
{"text":"The first time I went, I thought maybe they just had an off day. I wasn't impressed.  It must have been a year between that first visit and the second. Well, it was during that second visit I remembered why in the hell I waited a year to return.  First of all, the service was less than average. I'm all for authentic Mexican food, but my server was so difficult to understand, and understand me, I was wondering if I actually had been transported south of the border.  It was NOT busy when we were there, but we were constantly looking for someone to help with the many issues we had during our meal.   They screwed up my kids burrito, (how tough is it to NOT serve it enchilada style).  My other son ordered beef tacos, he loves tacos, took one bite and was like YUCK! I said seriously, it can't be that bad, so I - being the dad who was raised not to waste food took a taste. - YUCK is right. How can you screw up ground beef? Well, I suppose if you can't serve a burrito plain, ground beef is way to tough to cook and season properly.  I ordered off the healthy menu and the piece of meat that came out on my plate would have made a nice treat for my Labrador, but not for me. Now maybe it was because I waited 5 minutes before trying my steak that caused it to suck so bad - but I was hoping to get my son a new meal, (which never happened btw) because by the time the waiter came back, my boy was so stuffed on chips and salsa, he didn't want anything else.  AND - the drinks were never refilled or topped off. AND - they didn't even offer to take the tacos off my bill. Hmmm. Customer satisfaction 101 me thinks???  All in all, I will NOT be going back here. El Palacio means the Palace...in my judgement, the King and Queen need to get their kingdom in order."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! And so is the service!  Our server was Jesse. He was very knowledgable about the menu, helped us understand some of the meals, quick to check in on us, and extremely friendly!  The food was delicious!  The salsa was amazing!  Definitely will be coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Go somewhere else! As previously stated, the service is horrible. Aside from that, I ordered a lemonade...they were out. My b/f ordered a Lumberyard Pale Ale....they were out. Our server was not helpful and all the servers were literally running down the aisles trying to help people and it was NOT even busy. I ordered the 3 Flags and my b/f ordered the house special burrito, without the rice and beans, and no sour cream. Our food came, my 3 flags was all very dry and small portion (fine) and my b/f's burrito came with rice, beans and sour cream. Since our waitress NEVER came back until she wanted to clear our plates, he decided not to deal with it and never ate it. They even charged us for the rice & beans. Instead of speaking up if we could even find her, we decided to show it on the tip and wrote a note on the bill. We will never go back. Bad service, no drinks available that we wanted, and \"meh\" food."}
{"text":"First time visit, but this might be my new favorite Mexican food place in Gilbert. It has a HUGE menu. They have a salsa bar with variations on the usual sauces. Good atmosphere.Decent size bar with a good selection. I had great service. The food was excellent."}
{"text":"Mini taco salad is the best item I've had here."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try something different. The salsa and bean trio served had great flavor, the chips were fresh and just right. I ordered the Verde Enchilada with pork tamale combo and my wife ordered the carne asada burrito. While the flavor of the enchilada was pretty darn good the masa of the tamale was ridiculously thick, I would have been able to make three proper tamales with that quantity. The burrito was a massive disappointment, thick chunks of steak in a very flat burrito. Again I stress that the flavors were fantastic but the quantity was pathetic for the cost. Overall- not planning on being a repeat customer.  As someone stated before, I'll be surprised if they last another year. For $10.00 more, head across the street to Texas Roadhouse."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday and arrived at 11:30.  We were the first diners in the restaurant, and there were two women at the bar.  Service was quick.  The Chips and Salsa were as good as any in the area.  My wife had the grilled chicken salad and I had the Mole Poblano.  Although I enjoyed the Mole, my wife's salad was unusual with vegetables that we did not expect in a chicken salad. (squash, 2 types, etc.)  We'll go back, but that salad is off the list.  By the time we left the place was packed."}
{"text":"First visit here.  As usual I order the chimi on a first visit to a Mexican place.  It was fine.  Not great, but not bad.  I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't make a point of visiting again either.  Service was fine (perhaps a little slow).  Food was OK.  Chips were fresh (warm), which I like.  Salsa was fine (nothing special).    Really rates 2.5 stars, but I don't have that option.  And it's not worthy of 3."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and it's the best burrito I've ever had. Albondigas soup is awesome too. I'm surprised there aren't more people here, considering how good this food tastes.  The free chips are hot and freshly made, and they give you bean dip plus 2 kinds of salsas. Big bonus!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to come and sit at the bar and have a couple of ice cold beers eat chips and salsa and chill. It's a relaxed atmosphere with good service. They have an enchilada plate called American flag, I could be wrong on the name, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Decent chips and salsa bar, food was good, atmosphere was so/so.  We like this place and I go here for lunch a few times a year and we'll go for dinner about once a year.  The food is really good, they have a good lunch menu and lots of flavor on everything.  They have a gluten free area in the kitchen so even my wife that has Celiac disease could eat there.  the only reason I knocked it down a star is for atmosphere.  There is nothing really intimate about the place and it was pretty hot.  I'll keep going here and recommend it to friends if they are looking for a place to eat and want to avoid the lines in downtown gilbert and the San Tan area."}
{"text":"Service was good. We really liked the waiter. The fish tacos didn't smell right nor taste good at all. They use store bought taco shells that were stale. The food was bland and nothing seemed to be fresh, like you would expect at an authentic Mexican restaurant. I was very disappointed and with all the other choices close by, there is no way I would go back to this place."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican food in the area, hands down. I love Yelp and generally you can get a good idea what to expect based on the overall vibe of the reviews, but this one is tricky. My wife and I come here at least once per week, but more often than not, we find ourselves here at least twice a week. Why???  PRO'S 1. If you like cold beer, like I do, I challenge you to find colder brew.  2. Chips and salsa. All you can eat! Any review you read that says they don't like the chips and salsa has to be from someone who likes chips from a bag and salsa from a jar. The chips are made fresh as is the variety of different salsas they offer at the salsa bar.  3. Taco Tuesday! Cheap tacos and beer specials. 4. Street Taco Thursday! If you like street tacos, you'll love these. I highly recommend the Pastor, which is a pineapple chipotle marinaded pork. But, they offer 4 or 5 different kinds of meat if pork isn't for you. They're all great! 5. Authentic food. Having met the owner Anthony (a professionally trained chef) who is from Mexico, there are items on the menu you just don't find at most Americanized Mexican food joints. Try the chicken mole, burrito style to see what I mean. It's fantastic. 5. The staff. Roy the bartender, Jacob and Jesse are typically our servers. They're all attentive and keep my mug full! 6. I enjoy sitting in the bar area. Playing Buzztime trivia and watching whatever games are on, keeps me entertained for hours.  Cons: 1. The place can get busy. Especially on Taco Tuesday. Even with a full staff, you might find yourself waiting. Don't get discouraged, have an ice cold beer and relax with your first world problems.  2. This is Mexican food. It's almost like pizza, it's not going to knock your socks off- but it's good food. The difference between average and the best you've ever had is a fairly small margin. This is good Mexican food, no doubt, but if you compare it to a Filet from Flemings your expectations are off.  3. Decor is what you'd expect. This is a family joint, not a high end restaurant with white table cloths and bow tied waitstaff.   I've tried a few other Mexican food restaurants and the Palace is hands down my favorite. If you don't agree, you might want to swing by Taco Bell for something that tastes more authentic to you."}
{"text":"The salsas are amazing!  Fresh and bright with just a hint of kick.   I was here with my husband and only had drinks, no entree.  The service and margaritas were great.   The ladies bathroom may have a slight drainage issue, as it smelled sour.  The soap seems really watered down which was a cause for concern, but after 7 or 8 pumps I was able to work a lather. With that in consideration, I question if not eating here was the right choice.  Again, the salsas and bean dip were great but the watered down soap is questionable at the least."}
{"text":"I live in the area of this restaurant, and we decided to go for happy hour on Tuesday. I had low expectations for this place. I was impressed they had Modelo on tap for $2, which is a major plus! The chips, salsa, beans, and hot salsa were excellent with free refills on the chips and salsa. $1 tacos on Tuesday! I was expecting a small crappy taco, I was wrong! This taco was awesome, and you cannot beat the price!! I found my new Taco Tuesday place!!"}
{"text":"I love the salmon chimichanga!!  I never get tired of it. I like that they open at 10:30 on Sunday. While people are waiting at other places to open at 11, we are in and ordering!!"}
{"text":"One of the best ever sit down Mexican eateries!  Good food Good service Able to accommodate birthday large groups!  This place should not let you down!  I have eaten here dozens of times!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service or the food, also we came because of a restaurant.com gift certificate and was informed that they weren't accepting them anymore, even though I had just purchased it today. Our waitress went to check on what could be done, when she returned about ten minutes later she explained that her manager had just left so she couldn't do anything except remove the charge for drinks. I ask what successful restaurant leaves themselves without a manager at 8pm on a Friday? We won't be returning, I suggest eating at any of the other food establishments in the area."}
{"text":"Hear me out before you agree or disagree! The food here is really good, and service here is just ok... I am 10 year 3 time Iraqi veteran, my wife and I have vowed not to support businesses that do not support military, this place does not give military discount! Was even told by the waiter that the owner made that decision! :-( so sad!   Bus lady was real lazy!"}
{"text":"This would be my least favorite Mexican restaurant. 4 years ago the food was better. Tonite the kids cheese enchilada had hardly  any cheese in it.  The waiter was completely inattentive as to our needs. My fajitas were just ok. Do not recommend for a good Mexican place. Def. won't be back."}
{"text":"My experience was great ! Jacob was awesome ! He provided excellent customer service , the food was great , the atmosphere was very welcoming and comfortable! I will definitely be coming back to el palacio ! I'm not sure about all the negative stars to me this was a great experience!"}
{"text":"I simply cant get myself to like the food here after 2-3 visits.  It's not gross, it just can't win my heart or wallet when there are so many great options around.  Gotta pass on this one."}
{"text":"First time we went, we had to walk out.  We didn't get service at all.  Not even a drink order.  But since we just moved to this area, we really wanted to find a great local Mexican place so we tried it again.    I wasn't super impressed.  Actually, I wasn't at all impressed.  It was okay food.  Okay service this time.  Their menu didn't offer the Mexican style I was hoping for.  It felt ... off to me.  Can't explain it.  They seemed to cater to either a nothing special appetite or a huge appetite, but not in between.  Does that make sense?  We did like the salsa and chips.  I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon though."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they have opened (about once every two years) and the quality of food has never improved.  The one in Bullhead City was always good so I don't know why the food is so bad here.  Not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Love Taco Tuesdays. Sat at the bar and enjoyed cocktails and Tacos, So yummy and soooooo very affordable!!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised to walk in at lunch time to see that it was not very busy at all. Usually, that's a bad sign, so I was a little worried, but I decided to try it out anyway.  Got the standard chips, salsa and bean dip right away, which was nice, because we (family of 5) were all starving. Service was fast and friendly. Food was great. I liked everyone else's dishes better than mine, though. I had tacos- one with shredded pork and one with chicken. The shells seemed just a tiny bit stale, but the filling was good. Because everyone else's dishes tasted great, I'm thinking my \"slightly\" stale tasting tortillas were just a fluke and I will try the tacos again anyway. There was a salsa bar with a nice variety of salsa and guacamole. Nice to see the guacamole didn't have an extra charge like most restaurants. While the salsa bar was clean and sanitary, I think it needs an upgrade. The bowls were set up on ice on a table and just looked sort of plain. I think they should upgrade to an actual small refrigerated salad bar and it would look much more appealing. Still, it didn't stop me from going back to it twice for salsa refills. Overall, I would recommend it. We had a nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying I love mexican food and being from San Diego, I know what good mexican food taste like.  We met some friends here for dinner last night and were expecting good food.  We all ordered our food (I had the carne asada quesadilla, hubs had cheese enchiladas with green sauce).  My quesadilla didn't taste bad and it didn't taste good.  There was nothing flavorful about the meat.  My husbands enchiladas had this green sauce on it and I've never seen green sauce so green! it was like a leprechaun threw up on them it was so green!   The chips and salsa were okay.  We had a hair in our chips (prob because anyone can get to the the self serve chips and salsa bar).  The drinks were okay...My friend and I had the red sangria and I've had better (should have stuck with beer).  If you're looking for good food and maybe some atmosphere then go somewhere else.  This place was dead and wasn't busy at all. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but we won't be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I hardly need to order any food once the free stuff stops coming whenever I eat in the bar area. Service has been hit or miss, but the amount of food you get for the price is excellent. Menu is huge too, always a plus! Bartender has always been very good."}
{"text":"I love trying new places and was excited to try this place, but I was very disappointed, as well as a few people from our party. My sister likes this place for happy hour with drinks and such, but we sat in the dining room. The hostess said they didnt have time to set up our table so they just brought silver ware on napkins and set it down. I thought that was kind of rude but all is good. Just simply my opinion.  Chips, salsa and bean dip, FABULOUS. Absolutely delicious. I enjoy great starters like that.  It was a Saturday night so they were busy but the place was not packed and there was no wait or line to sit. Our server was really nice, but she was so slow. Serving and having that nack for it is an art, but it is teachable. My family has been servers and in the industry for years so we understand the gist of it. She probably did not get proper training because she was so unorganized, and it took multiple questions and attempts for her to follow though to bring us anything before she took off running before we were even done talking. She was really nice and I know she is trying to make ends meet, but the service was bad.  Mom had the chicken chimichunga. It was under cooked, flat and absolutely tasteless. I split the carne asada burrito with my partner. I enjoyed it, but the steak (in my opinion) was too big. I am used to it being cut up smaller, but it was hardly stuffed with steak and it was flat. Rice and beans were pretty good, but overall dinner was very disappointing. I felt horrible that night and was bloated. My system just did not agree.  Overall, the evening was not bad. Just frustrating with the lack of service, and so-so quality of the food. You could tell the restaurant was very unorganized and no one knew what was going on. There was a table of 6 who left about 30 minutes after we got there, (they were done) and it took over 20+ minutes for the table to even get cleaned and reset while I watched a part of 6 or 7 sit up front for over 20 minutes, and there were some other free tables. We also watched food get brought to the wrong table over 3 times. So even though we were in our own world, seeing all this took away from the experience.  I am not sure if I recommend this place or not. I felt horrible after I ate there but I may give them another shot in the future. I was only here once, but to me, first impressions are everything. They are in a great location and I hope they read these and will work on improving their food and system of running the restaurant."}
{"text":"Service is sub par.  Long waits for service and unfriendly.  You're better off using your hard earned dollars elsewhere.  Food is \"meh\".  I could make better Mex food at home."}
{"text":"If you want awesome, cheap Mexican food - look no further!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place completely love it. It's not traditional Mexican, but it's really good. Chips and salsa is the best. Only problem is service really is bad. But shame on me we keep going back."}
{"text":"Came into town visiting family and was looking for some good Mexican food and this place did not disappoint! The whole family was very happy with their food and the service. Jacob was our server and he was very knowledgable and attentive. He gave very good suggestions and I got the Carnitas Rancheras, which was amazing. The house margaritas are also worth every penny! I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I would really give 3.5 stars but decided to be generous with 4. We went on a weeknight and were seated right away. Place has trivia to play on your phone so my boyfriend loved that and it was fun to play a game while eating/drinking. Our servers were pleasant and nice, chips and salsas came out right away. Love the chips and salsa, as well as the homemade bean dip! I could eat an insane amount of these!   The menu has a lot of options to choose and I went with the chicken fajitas. Food came out quick and was hot! I wasn't a huge fan of the seasoning that was cooked with the fajitas, a little spicy for my taste. Rice and beans were delicious, too bad they charge an extra $1.25 for sour cream and guacamole. The margarita was also really good but $10.   I haven't been on taco Tuesday but am interested in checking it out!"}
{"text":"Very good. I had the señorita tostada off the lunch menu. I expected a tostada shell not a taco salad shell. It was still tasty and was very inexpensive. Big menu with lots of options."}
{"text":"would not recommend. Our visit started off bad. The \"hostess\" or what we thought was the hostess started off extremely rude when she sat us down.. We were meeting 2 other people there and my husband and I beat them there so we got a table and sat down first. When our friends arrived, the \"hostess\" turned out to be our waitress as well, just looked at our table and finally 5 minutes later came to take our order for drinks. 5 minutes later we received our water. 15 minutes later she walked by, and said she would be right back to take our order. In the next 10 minutes she went to another table to take their order and ran food to 2 other tables. Then she came back to us, and in a rude voice asked to take our order for dinner, very impatiently. The whole night she did not have a smile on her face, very impatient and rushed. And the restaurant was not even busy!! There was maybe 5 tables that had customers. Onto the food, I just ordered an appetizer 7 layer dip, as we had eaten earlier and was still full, my dip was bland. I have had better 7 layer dip from a grocery store. My fiancé ordered 4 street tacos (btw you can not mix and match different kinds of meat, you HAVE to get 2 of the same kind) he said they were bland and nothing special. Overall, horrible experience, bad food, not authentic Mexican, will not return"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, always great service and great food. Many different salsas to pick from and some of the best beans around."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The food amazing. Loved the salsa! Enjoyed the sangria. Our first time here but excited to come back."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I have reviewed here only once in the last 2 years. I am only motivated to share if the experience is particularly bad. I took my girlfriend and her Aunt who was visiting from out of town to El Palacio for dinner. I had been there many times before and, although not impressive, I remember it wasn't bad. This time, however, was different. the Aunt had dietary constraints and could not eat flour, dairy, alcohol, etc. This being the case, she opted to ask the server about the Chile Relleno omelet, asking if they could not include the breading as she couldn't eat it. The server immediately informs her that \"that's how they come\". Assuming this was a restaurant with some semblance of fresh ingredients, I asked again. He insisted that the breading could not be removed as \"it simply comes that way\". Now, of course, I'm thinking \"ok, that means they're serving Chile Rellenos from a frozen box. I ordered one and my suspicion was confirmed; you could taste the freezer in the cheese. It was nasty.   Instead, the Aunt asks if they could make a vegetable omelet. The server looks at her like he's stumped and says, \"what kind of veggies, we don't really have veggies\". I tell him just a omelet with vegetables in it and he says he has to go check with the cook to see if they can do that. He comes back and says \"Good news! The cook says we can do that.\" Understand, we weren't asking for fresh caught Maine lobster here, just 2 eggs and some of those peppers we saw go sizzling by a moment earlier. The omelet comes out and the Aunt goes poking around in it to make sure there's nothing in it she can't eat. What she finds is the omelet is stuffed with peas and carrots. Seriously. Peas and carrots. When was the last time you had an omelet with PEAS and CARROTS? And we're talking about the little square carrots like they just came out of a can! He asked how the food was and we all stated that it was an unusual choice for a veggie omelet, especially as we were looking at peppers, onions and tomatoes at the next table. He actually says \"What?!? You've never heard of that?!?\" and walks away. Perhaps that's why in the hour and a half we were there, I only received 1 beer and had to ask other servers to relay messages to ours because he never made it back around until time to deliver the check.  I have made it a point to tell everyone I've come in contact with today to avoid this restaurant. The food wasn't even marginal and the service was some of the worst I've ever had. I feel like an idiot for taking my girl's Aunt there on our first meeting (as she must think, given my recommendation in the first place)."}
{"text":"The crummy service I have experienced here is OVER! The rude waiter has been let go. Thank you! I LOVE El Palacio & make it a point to visit   once a week. The lunch specials are very cheap & you get TONS of   delicious food."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in before we went to see a movie. We had already had dinner so we only stopped in for a cocktail and some deserts.   We sat on the patio which was really nice. We were the only ones sitting at the patio, so we were worried that we would be forgotten about but the service was still rather good.  He had a beer and I had a frozen strawberry margarita. The margarita was slightly watered down and could have used a bit more strawberry to it. My husband tried a beer called Victoria which actually wasn't bad at all. I also ordered a frozen ice cream. I went with the vanilla ice cream. The presentation was lovely and I enjoyed the deep fried ice cream.   I did hit up the bathroom before we headed out to the theater and I was very impressed with the bathroom. The women's bathroom has a large full sized mirror and the handicapped/nursing bathroom is very large and has ton of room.   Overall, it was a nice experience and we may end up going back for dinner on our next date night."}
{"text":"Service is so slow every time I come here. But there are no other closer Mexican restaurant near here."}
{"text":"We have came to El Palacio a couple of times now and we thought the food was yummy, the prices are good and the service was pretty good...(it's funny we have had the same waiter each time and he seems new so a little slow.) We hope to go again soon and maybe get a different waiter or waitress that knows the menu and fills your water up frequently...;-)  Hopefully the owners read this and all up above and make the service a priority...We need a good mexican food restaurant to come to at least once a month. ;-)"}
{"text":"I LOVE the beans and salsa....the BEST in the valley.  I love, love, love the Sangarita here, too.  It's a great place to have a drink."}
{"text":"We stopped in around 8:30 on a Saturday night and the place was very empty. Good service...chips and salsa were brought immediately and our drink order was taken. Good, strong Margaritas! I really liked the salsa too. I wasn't very hungry so I ordered some mexican pizza appetizer thing which I did not care for. I did try some of my boyfriends veggie fajitas though and I though they were very good! I would try it again and order something else. I haven't written this place off yet. :)"}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant a handful of times.  Service is usually pretty good.  The chips, salsa, and bean dip are amazing.  We love their lunch specials, usually around $6-$8 ea. and dinner menu pricing is not too bad either.  The restaurant is not very busy, and the food is delicious!!!  We haven't eaten anything we haven't liked.  They make really good tamales too!"}
{"text":"Disappointing experience on New Years Day. After we were seated, it took 11 minutes for the waiter to take our order. As I was ordering my food, I noticed that the heavy-set man also happened to be sagging exposing his briefs. Not very appetizing. The fajitas were simple with a low quality meat. The fiesta platter was literally thrown together and not appetizing. The salsa was the only thing good. This place has promise, but given the number of stars on Yelp, it's time for the owners to fire the manager before it's too late. If only Jon Taffer rescued restaurants...."}
{"text":"This place is very meh. The food is old people food: bland, saltless, flavorless. The service was not bad, but mediocre at best.   The tables weren't very clean and the bench seats were very uncomfortable. Even my kids thought the seats were uncomfortable and they can sit on almost anything.   The salsas and bean dip were pretty good, but that's the only good I can say about this place. For its location, I'm surprised such a mediocre place can compete against the better places around here."}
{"text":"Found was ok but not great.  Service was slow and we had to ask for refills and more drinks.  I was expecting more and will not return."}
{"text":"Has the el padrino burrito. Has everything you can think in it. Jalapeños, pico, crema, carne, etc. it's huge too! Enjoyed there chips and salsa and beans as well. Solid spicy Mexicans food."}
{"text":"Always looking for some good Mexican food so we decided to try El Palacio. So happy we did! We sat in the bar area and Roy the bartender was excellent! Food was delicious beers were cold, and service was phenomenal. Very friendly staff. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I decided to try this place out recently and we liked it! The chips, salsa and beans that are served prior to your meal were good! It was a nice introduction to our meal :) Food had a really good taste to it. The meat was tasty. Overall, good place!"}
{"text":"Family lunch today after church service.  Good service, plenty of chips and delicious salsa to munch on.  Food was great, portion size was great. Price was reasonable.  I would recommend to all."}
{"text":"Food was not good and service was subpar. Best item we had was an appetizer and that was decent, at best. Last time I'll be dining there."}
{"text":"The building is nice to look at,  but the food is terrible!  My 2 younger kids both ordered tacos from the kids menu with rice. Both love mexican food and neither could stand the flavor of this salt filled meal. It was like an entire container of salt was dumped onto each plate. I order beans which were disgusting.  By oldest son ordered a carne asada burrito.  He normally can eat anything and turned this food away. We walked away refusing to pay as none of our food was eatable. We will never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Terrible service from Rebecca, charged incorrectly for one of our meals (fajitas) and the meat for the fajitas came 10 minutes after the rest of our food so our table was done eating by the time our part member got their food. Our waitress never apologized and rolled her eyes when we had to ask another server for our check. Needless to say, will not return. On a positive note, chips and salsa were good."}
{"text":"I will be adding this place to one of my favorites.  The food and beer were great.  I usually not a big fan of the beans and rice, but theirs were fresh and real good.  They have a good selection of food and beer including some craft beers.  My wife had the El Padriono Burrito and I had the Seaside Delight with a Lumberyard IPA.  Loved it all."}
{"text":"While on the southeast side of town, I happened across El Palacio. It looked enticing enough from the outside, and was cute and clean inside.  I did happen to notice that it was all booths and smaller tables, so I wonder how they would be accommodating larger groups.  The menu offerings seemed sparse and odd. One should make a mental note when the \"Chef's Special\" at a Mexican restaurant is a burger.  I reluctantly ordered the Queso-Dilla , which was like a quesadilla wrapped into a burrito with meat inside. It was actually really good, and in good proportion. My husband had the steak fajitas, which he said \"were good\". I don't know what that really means.  The bathrooms were unclean and had no TP, a huge no-no in a Mexican establishment, no? The service was good and the server friendly and attentive. But if he hey bro'd us one more time, I was going to give him the Bruce Lee one inch punch.  Overall, El Palacio was edible and underwhelming. We would probably pass it by in the future."}
{"text":"The food was ok.  We were seated at the bar and the bar tender was very inattentive it took a hour to get a menu and when  person in my party spilled a drink he got aggravated.  Not a good experience"}
{"text":"Great place , good bean dip free too , chips and salsa to go , great staff , good place to eat"}
{"text":"Been there a few times. Their salsas and bean dip are very good. Great chips as well. Consistantly good food and a nice atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"Stop yourself right now. Walk away quickly.  Man, I have NEVER said that about a restaurant anywhere before. Like for the reals. Usually I can find one good thing to say about any place I go to, but this is the exception to the rule.  The interior of this place looks like an old Chili's...does anyone know if it used to be? The decor is failing and everything on the walls looked extremely dusty. It is run down in appearance and that was my first red flag.  We waited at our table for a good 7-8 minutes before we were even approached for a drink order and even then, we were told that he would be right back to get our drink order. Did I mention the place was not busy? There had to have been a max of three other tables that were seated.  We then waited 25 minutes for our food to be delivered once we were able to order...not sure what was going on there...but when the food arrived, I knew immediately that I was going to be in for a long night of bathroom runs if we stayed. I ordered a combo plate with a mini bean burrito and a cheese enchilada. My boyfriend had a chile relleno.  I choked down a few bites of rice and beans because the enchilada was out of the question after I precariously tried a morsel of it.  Then after very clearly pushing our plates to the edge of the table to signify we were done, ten minutes passes. Our server didn't even deliver our food and never stopped by to make sure everything was ok. I finally had to flag down a busser and ask if he could send over our server so we can pay. Another server came over and took our credit card for us and we were able to pay and get the heck outta there.  Will not be back and no amount of coercing or bribery would work. As feared, the bathroom and I became fast friends after this meal."}
{"text":"No customer service. No friendliness it was just a kind of here you go and what else do you want attitude. The guy who brought out the chips and dip made no eye contact and didn't respond when I said thank you, Had to ask if it was happy hour because the server said nothing just asked what we wanted to drink then goes and tells the next table about it? So not sure if I reminded him that he should be doing that. But bad service. Ordered a margarita that tasted like cheap tequila with no salt! Who makes a margarita without a salted rim?! When we ordered our food he asked if we wanted rice beans with our meal and I had to ask if it was included.... Which it isn't! What mexican restaurant doesn't included rice and beans and why weren't we told from the start it's at an extra charge? After that he didn't come back to check on us. The food it's self is mediocre. I could have ate better at filberto's .... Will most likely not be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Gilbert Rd & 202 location three times now, as I keep taking more people there (never during happy hour)  The chips are hot and crispy, the salsa are fabulous, and everytone really likes the cheesy bean dip.  I've only had the quesadilla which I thought was tremendous all three times.  It was cheesy and the carne asada was juicy and tender.  The sour cream comes with bits of onion in it and is absolutely yummy. They have an excellent beer selection and you can play trivia at the bar.   They usually bring you a little free dessert, too which is always delicious."}
{"text":"This place was extraordinarily bad. The service was bad and the food was bland and subpar. We didn't get a drink menu when we were first seated and when I asked the hostess if I could have one she said she would get one but never returned. The waitress had to go find one after she explained not every table got one but at least she  did return with one but once I asked for a minute we didn't see her again for 10 minutes. She  apparently couldn't take our meal order until she came back with the drinks, after another 10 min., even though she came by our table several times. We were only given only 2 sets of dinnerware (which included a cheap paper napkin and a fork only) & there were 3 of us. We had to ask for a knife and then they only brought one, again there were 3 of us eating. The food was not hot when we got it but lukewarm and it was very bland. Taco Bell has spicier food. The Mexican food wasn't even spicy enough for my sons grandmother, who doesn't care for food that's to spicy. The margarita tasted like the tequila was watered down and when I took a sip I got a mouth full if syrup, so it clearly it hadn't been mixed well or at all. The only thing we got in a timely manner was our check. At least this place was cheap. Definitely would not eat there ever again."}
{"text":"The Good:  The Salsa is pretty good, they give you both a hot and a mild with your chips.  They also provide a bean dip that isn't bad either.      The Bad:   The food is nothing special.   I got the shrimp burrito and all it in it were bean, rice and five shrimp.  For $12-$13 bucks i was expecting a little more.    My wife had the carne asada tacos and wasn't that impressed either.  We went on a Friday night and they said it would be 20min wait.  No big deal it is a Friday night I thought.  But when we were finally sitting down half the place was empty.    So i didn't really get why we had to wait.  The waiter was unorganized, he gave us a check that had items on it we didn't even order.   To top it all off, its was really hot in there.   Its Arizona in the middle of summer for god sake.  If your going to serve sub-par food at least keep the place cool."}
{"text":"Food service was timely, food quality was phenomenal. Lauren, our server, was by far the most friendly and attentive service staff I have encountered in a long time. Marg Monday was wonderful and place was very clean too. Come to check out the salsa bar, be aware,they have some hot ones!!! Great place to eat."}
{"text":"What, I love this place. They have the best bean dip ever! Free wifi, the good kind too. My kids can watch Netflix while my husband and I can talk. I had a great fajita salad. Our kids love there quesadillas. They have a salsa bar and great appetizers and Margaritas. They also have happy hour, then you can walk to the movies after."}
{"text":"This place is just down the street which is awesome.. it has great salsa.. and a decent selection of entrees.. The prices are also in the right range. I had the Del Mar which is a seafood enchilada dish and it was quite good!  The best thing was their service.. Chris H. was our waiter and he was on his game! My son downs his soda in minutes and he never waited for a refill.. (that's impressive..)  I would give 5 stars if the margarita had been better.. lime on the rocks and it tasted like a premixed drink without a drop of tequila in it..   All in all it was a nice dinner and I would definitely go back.."}
{"text":"We love the Kingman el palacio so we were hoping it would be just as good .                 SURPISE  It was even better ! After checking in with YELP we recieved a coupon for 1 free appetizer with 2 entrees . Yeah ! We ordered the fiesta platter ($9.99) it was mini tacos , taquitos, nachos & cheese quesadilla . The platter was ok, but I wouldn't order it again. My bf & I ordered the carne asada burrito with rice ($12.99) this was fantastic ! The beef was grilled and seasoned perfectly . Tortilla tasted homemade as did the rice .. My fav part was at the end when we got little strawberry roll ups with whipped cream . So cute so tasty .. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Tried El Palacio for the first time tonight. I have passed it by many times and my fiancé and I decided that tonight we would give it a try. We were seated right away in a corner booth. Our waiter was quick to bring drinks and chips and salsa and bean dip were also brought out. The bean dip was tasty and the hot salsa was good, the mild salsa was a little watery.  I ordered two mini machaca beef taquitos and a cheese enchilada with red sauce. The taquitos were really good. The cheese enchilada was okay but the red sauce tasted very generic. My fiancé got a bean burrito enchilada style and it was just okay. The rice and beans that came with my meal were very bland. Service was okay throughout our visit, slow at times but our drinks were always refilled. At the end  of meal we also received two complementary mini churro's with whipped cream which were delicious, I could have easily eaten many more of these but I am glad they cut you off at two because I'm sure they are unbelievably bad for you.  Overall it was an okay visit. I would not go out of my way to come back here but I might be back on occasion if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Was craving Mexican food for lunch.  Went with friends.  I got the Mexican pizza.  It was disgusting. First it was cut hap-hazard, topped with jarred jalapeno mixed with carrots, and onions like a hot mix.  Horrible.  Guacamole had no taste.  I was so disappointed.  My friends were not happy with their food either however I cannot speak for them.  Their salsas left a LOT to be desired.  Will never go there again.  DO NOT RECOMMEND if you want decent Mexican food."}
{"text":"Beer was cold, chips were terrific as was the salsa and beans that came with them Newer building good ambience.  Good experience"}
{"text":"It's rare that my Yelpers let me down, but this was one of the few times. Was searching for a new Mexican restaurant just to change things up - this place had overall good reviews, so took the family and my parents here on a Saturday afternoon.  Service was slow and not friendly: Place was overall dead - only about 5 tables occupied. Several wait-staff present. First I had to stare down the waiter to get his attention and get our drink order placed, when we were ignored by the waitress serving the next table, who walked by us several times in the 10+ minutes we waited after sitting. He seemed in a rush when servicing us, not sure what else he had to do. In the car while discussing our thoughts of the place, my son told me the waiter had rolled his eyes when he changed his order WHILE he took our initial order. Wish he would have pointed that out then.  Margarita was fine, nothing better or worse than anywhere else I've had - not good enough for a second. But the food was why I came. It was soon apparent that this is a \"gringo\" Mexican place, so I'm rating it based on that.   The queso dip was a pretty good start. But when I got my main dish, the Chile Relleno had more batter than I've seen in a long time. Looked and tasted reheated. Rice was very bland and beans had some weird aftertaste and were not fully cooked (al dente). My dad had Chili Verde and was pretty unimpressed with that. Others had fajitas and those seemed to be ok but not as good as other chains. We discussed in car afterward and agreed it was boring, bland and not worth a repeat.  All-in-all probably a decent place for happy hour (I noticed they had some pretty good looking specials / pricing). But not a place I'd go for Mexican food. Not authentic and not cheap enough to justify bad Mexican food (our bill for 6 was over $120, including 2 kids and one margarita). The service I'll chalk up to our waiter but definitely deducted a star for that."}
{"text":"Our server was so nice! He was super busy and made sure to let us know but still continues to check on us as he should. Our food though was awful! My shredded beef chimi had zero flavor, and my rice wasn't cooked all the way. My boyfriend had carne Asada which apparently had no flavor also. Something about it didn't look right when it came out, which would explain the food poisoning he got right afterwards. It was our first time there and I was hoping it was just a bad night but after reading the reviews on here and other places I guess it's common to have awful food there."}
{"text":"Decent food, a little greasy but service was good. Salsa and chips were awesome. Very few people in restaurant at time we were there. Nice family ambience and not too spicy."}
{"text":"The food did not taste great and my husbands order came out on the cold side. :/ We will not be going back as we were not impressed."}
{"text":"I love this place, it has excellent food, great selection for spirts. Overall one of my favorites to enjoy the environment to have  drinks and good laughs while eating food.   I will say if your a couple that is just coming in to get a quick bite to eat I dont think the service is quite what it needs to be.   Totally a different vibe for thoughs that can enjoy themselves. I rated a 4 only because the service lacks to get a full 5. Awesome cantina hope this helps."}
{"text":"I think El Palacio gets the shaft here on Yelp. I have been here a few times and every time they have been super nice, i've had quick service and great food. It's always hot and exactly what I asked for. I've never had a problem and they even have given us free dessert twice! Im a fan and will keep going back!"}
{"text":"This is a good Mexican food restaurant with many different options. Service is very good and everyone was friendly.  I do think it is over priced for what I got though and I felt it could have been more flavorful."}
{"text":"i think the restaurant got replaced by an indoor ant hill because ants kept swarming our table the whole time we were here. how the fuck do you run a restaurant and allow a colony of ants to make a base of operations in your dining room? place never fails to disappoint."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. amazing salsa and really nice people. Would have gotten 5 stars if the margaritas weren't so pricy. Just a tad too much for 2 drinks and a quesadilla. aside from that its truly awesome"}
{"text":"We went last night for Mom's birthday and had a good dinner. I was pleased with the service from the waiter who another reviewer referred to as a jerk - we sat just outside the bar area, had prompt service, were provided silverware without asking for it, had the specials explained to us. He went so far as to help us get a little extra food for free with the special and upgraded my mom's marg for her birthday.  The marg itself was good and the place has a good selection of local beers all on Happy Hour.  The food was good, love the rice and the beans - nothing dry or overcooked here. The chips came out fresh and crisp and warm. The only complaint I had was that my \"empanada\" came out in a folded over tortilla and not as a dumpling of sorts, which was really disappointing. I like the breadiness of an empanada - if I wanted a tortilla dish I would have ordered a quesadilla or another taco. The filling was good though and I enjoyed the salsa and the pico de gallo that came with the chips.  We were a little disappointed that the salsa bar is only available Tuesdays and Sundays, but we'll just have to come back. My dad swears by the habanero hot sauce."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and decided to try this place, based on the Yelp score. The food was good, the chips and salsa were fresh, but the margarita was just o.k. We were happy with the service."}
{"text":"(2 1/2 stars)   In the Phoenix area, where I was born and mostly raised, I have been to more disappointing restaurants than I can count..  My family has their stand-bys (La Casa Blanca in Chandler is one of our favorites and so was the Gecko Grill before they shut it down), but we decided to give this one a try over the holidays.    This place was pretty solid if you're looking for a cheap place to feed a family.  At the hostess stand, we were informed that all appetizers were free in the bar area during happy hour--so major points there.  We decided to sit in the dining room though, and there was one poor guy running the entire floor all night.  So service was slow, but given the circumstances, I think the server did a great job.  To start, they have 3 types of dips to offer with the chips--a bean dip, a mild salsa and a spicier salsa.  The mild salsa had too much cilantro for me, but my family seemed to enjoy it. The spicier version was delicious and loaded with garlic.   The menu was (almost too?) extensive and had lots of things like burgers and chicken wings on there mixed in with authentic Mexican (menudo, anyone?) and Tex-Mex. I had the \"A La Carte #2\" option which, true to its name, came with a single chile relleno and a spinach enchilada.  The relleno sauce was almost inedibly salty, so I had to scrape quite a bit of it off, but the pepper itself was good.  The spinach enchilada was pretty delicious, though, again, salty.   My parents gave mixed reviews on their seafood chimis...I had a bite and didn't like it....I think there was fake crabmeat in there somewhere so it just tasted weirdly fishy. My sister had a chicken tostada compuesta, and she seemed the happiest.  I also had a margarita on the rocks...not the best I've had, but good.  Also tried the frozen mango margarita, which was kind of watery.    We topped off the meal with fried ice cream....the fried bowl with cinnamon sugar was better than the ice cream itself, which tasted like the grease they fried it in...mine was saved by the .25 shot of Kahlua poured onto it.  They also offer chocolate fried ice cream, which my sister didn't like....it wasn't my favorite, either, but it was nice to see something unique.  Because of the slow service, the server threw in a plate of these mini fried things stuffed with apples...not sure what they were, but I enjoyed them.  All told, it wasn't anything stellar, but I would come here again."}
{"text":"After a break, we gave El Palacio another shot. So glad that we did. Food, flavor wise, is pretty good. I do have to question some of the \"freshness\" as the food almost comes out too fast to be made to order. I can't help but to think much is pre-made and frozen, to be heated and served. I really like their salsas, and the Ranchero sauce. I'm usually a huge fan of chili rellanos, but their's tends to be quiet soggy (which screams frozen). I've tried to order the cauliflower nachos several times, and they've never had them.   the carnitas rancheras is very good. The tamales are just average. The soups are salty, but tasty. Get a combo and try a couple of different things."}
{"text":"I will give the review three stars because our food was crazy good. Our server was awful. Like unbelievably horrible. I get that they were a bit busy, but she was not even friendly. It took FOREVER to get a drink. FOREVER to order our food. After eating, it took FOREVER to get our check. We gave up paying with my debit card and pooled our cash together so that we didn't have to keep waiting for her. It was disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"I have been here on taco Tuesday and had great service but tonight's service was above and beyond my expectations!! Our server Lucas was amazing! He made sure our glasses were never empty and our food was delivered hot and delicious! I will be back and will make sure Lucas is my server! Thank you Lucas for the amazing service!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!! Best Mexican food I've had anywhere...and I've had my fare share of both upscale & hole in the wall places. Salsa is consistently award winning, food is quality, and priced very reasonably. My favorite is the Mexican Flag.   One of those places you want to support with your patronage b/c you don't want to lose out on such a great place!"}
{"text":"This place needs to hire someone to answer there phone. I've tried to reach someone there for the past hour and get a message saying the mailbox is full. For a place that says they deliver SUCKS at it!"}
{"text":"The food sucks! It's just bad salty food with no real spices or  flavor besides salt. Total white trash gringo food! I've eaten better tasting dog down in Mexico! Also its over priced for bland garbage on a plate."}
{"text":"This is our favorite local Mexican food restaurant.  The food is excellent and they also have a vegetarian section which is amazing for me.  I love their salsa bar.  They have a delicious variety but their chunky red salsa, sour cream salsa and green salsa cannot be missed!  Also, if you like local beers and a good variety of Mexican beers, this is a great place for happy hour."}
{"text":"Not that great, this \"mexican\" is very TV dinner-like. I was not impressed, I would only go back if I had to."}
{"text":"When we moved to the neighborhood, I was pleased that there was a Mexican restaurant nearby.  We decided to stop in for lunch, even before our move-in date.  We liked it!  We sat in the bar area, just because that's where all of the servers were stationed for that time period.  Love their burritos (but they're HUGE!), tacos and enchiladas.  I'm a big fan of their bean dip as well.  We've been here many times for dinner and have never been disappointed.  All of the servers have been great every time.  I've read some of the other reviews and I can't really relate.  We've been pretty happy.  And sometimes, they'll even treat you to a small (and VERY tasty) dessert for free!  Don't be discouraged by some of the bad reviews.  I'm pretty picky and this place works for me!"}
{"text":"We went here a long time ago and didn't ever want to go back. We then got invited here by some friends and went. In a year the food and service has rebounded. We enjoyed our meals and the service was pretty good too!   Everything was clean and you couldn't really find much to complain about. If its the same owners I am going to guess it was just an off night when we came before, we will be back for sure now!"}
{"text":"While the reviews of this restaurant are evenly distributed across the board from one to five, I would have to say that I was quite happy with experience. First they have a nice selection of craft brews including Devil Ale from Santan Brewing as well as other AZ brewers (unfortunately no HopKnot).  The complimentary bean dip as well as the salsa with chips were tasty and if you want more heat there is a small salsa bar with more options.  While not in my 'hood, if there is something I wanted to see at the nearby Harkins, I would definitely come back and check it out."}
{"text":"I had the three flags. Chicken,  Machaca and pork. Very tasty I also had the Gold Cadillac. It was very good. I would give them 5 stars except they over charged me by a buck. The waiter corrected it and I gave him a great tip. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"About your average Mexican food place..  The chips, Salsa & bean dip were all good. And can't complain about the food. I ordered the Shredded beef Chimi. Not to much filling but was tasty. Service was on the slow side. We didn't get any refills on Drink or chips/salsa.   **PLEASE STOP** using your cups to scoop the ice with!!!! Every cup was extremely chipped. Not to mention its against health code!"}
{"text":"Came here for the \"street fair\". $5 per person to get in. $5 for 2 street tacos which went very good. $6 for a generic mix margarita. Way too loud raggae music. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Prompt friendly service is a must for me and El Palacio delivers. The chips with bean dip and salsa are yummy and my entrees flavorful. Great option if you want a sit down Mexican dinner."}
{"text":"Stay FAR away. If I could give this zero stars I would. This place is disgusting. Honestly, we are open to different kinds of food and establishments, but this place can't even make the basics right- cheese enchilada had a piece of cheese stuffed in the middle and not even melted, the tacos were horrible, and the service for a slower (6 tables total there) late-lunch time was ridiculous. Save your money and time."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place out.  I've lived in Arizona my entire life and have lived in Chandler for the last year and tonight everyone agreed on Mexican food.     The location is perfect and outside presentation is nice.  Once inside you notice the bar area with quite a few lively people watching the ASU game- everyone looked quite happy and enjoying themselves.    We ordered the appetizer platter and after my first bite of the mini taco I asked everyone if we should leave.  Everyone said no since we already ordered.  That first bite was a very good insight to what our meal would be like.    We all ordered full meals on top of the appetizer and were very disappointed.  Everything tasted like cafeteria style food.  Not one fresh, quality dish was served.  The beans tasted canned and scorched, the rice was overly bland and the chicken fajitas and flour tortillas were rubbery.  A shredded pork salad was ordered and was not any better.  They have an abundance of items to choose from and are a master of none.  The only item that was decent were the grilled veggies that came with the chicken fajitas."}
{"text":"Atrocious. The worst restaurant we've been to in the past year. I ordered enchiladas. They were cold in the middle. They actually reheated old enchiladas and served them to me. Disgusting. My girlfriend ordered a quesadilla and got a tasteless cheese crisp. Never coming near this place again."}
{"text":"if your in the mood for cheap greasy Mexican food you found the right place, food is not that bad it is a little too salty don't even try the soup if you cant take a pound of salt. If your craving Mexican it does the trick cant beat the price the chips & salsa are free with any meal and it is the best part I would compare it to filibertos it it were a restaurant that served you only thing is El Palacio has better salsa"}
{"text":"4 stars for food, 2 stars for service.   If you sit AT the bar, Anthony (the owner) will serve you and he's great.  However, if you sit at a table or booth in the bar area, be prepared for poor service with a side of attitude. We have had the same male server in the bar twice now, and he is really a jerk. His name escapes me, but you'll recognize him by his brusque manner and very short/shaved head.  On our most recent visit, I brought along two friends, and when the server brought our appetizer, he basically slammed it and the plates on our table and left. He did not mention how hot the plate was, nor did he return to ask if we needed anything else. We had to catch his attention when we needed water. Fortunately, the margaritas were decent, but I was still embarrassed that I had suggested this place.  At least the lady who brought chips and salsa did so quickly and with a smile.   Food is decent, though inconsistent. Chips, salsa, and beans are yummy.  Will we return? Maybe. But we won't be sitting in this guy's area again."}
{"text":"The myth of the farther away from the bar the worse the service has been broken! Jesse is the best server that has walked into this place!"}
{"text":"The food here was just average at best.  I had a ground beef taco and a shredded beef enchilada and nothing really stood out.  There are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Just had the Godfather burrito and it was soooo good! Green chile's really made it.  Very impressed with that and the chips and salsa.   We'll definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Having gone back twice, I can now state that their food is terrible.  The salsa is uneven.  The bean dip is good, but it tears me up inside.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Maah. That was my husband's response. It wasn't great but not horrible. My enchilada was room temp and taco the same. Best part was the cold beer in a real cool looking,  chilled mug. Everything else was just so so."}
{"text":"Food was yuck at best.   Service meh.  Drinks inconsistent.  Don't waste your money or time"}
{"text":"Evening trivia!   The beer is good, the mixed drinks are good, the margaritas are better than most places, like señorvesas to name names.   I had the sopa del Mar. The lady said good choice and I was worried a $15 soup was not going to be good or filling. I was wrong for worrying. Let's say for starters I took half of it home. The soup was amazing. Mussels, shrimp and some good meaty fish. The broth is delicious and it's served with extra toppings.  This place serves beans and two salsas with their chips which is a nice change.   I like the ambiance and the bar but this place is not open late. It has a patio and is animal friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure if this is the right place. Address might be off, but it's been a long time since I've done anything right. Gunshot. Inexpensive. Delicious. In an area of so many chains and theme establishments, this place has a great southwest vibe. Wyatt Earp and family would cum all over the place if they ate here. Great hard shell tacos and various dips for nachos. Also saw a sexy Latin chick at the bar on Christmas Eve there with two of her friends. I was with my brother and a friend. Was gonna say hello a few sips into my drink but the girls settled up and left pretty quick. I'm not that ugly so they must have had to be somewhere. If I ever see her again, it's game on."}
{"text":"Closest thing to being In Mexico the food is so good the service is always great and the atmosphere is filled with fun.."}
{"text":"This was our first and last time here!  Service was horrendous and food mediocre at best.  We waited for a long time to get our food and it was cold!  My daughter got chicken fingers and we asked for ranch.  Got Bleu cheese which we hate!!!!  Our soft drinks not once got refilled.  I asked for the check and waited another 15 minutes to get that.  I have never left a restaurant without tipping.... tonight I did."}
{"text":"Service was OK.  Underwhelming Gringo Mexican food.  Chef specialties don't come with rice & beans...  Cheese crisp was greasy even for a cheese crisp.  I kept thinking I could have eaten here and had much better food for less:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-ranchero-chandler"}
{"text":"I have to say, I really do like the food at El Palacio, but after numerous trips with awful service, I'll no longer be going back.  Although, I think the service varies depending on who your server is. We've been (un)lucky enough to have the same male server in the bar area every time we've gone and he's the absolute worst!  It took about 10 minutes for him to even ask us what we wanted to drink and then dissapeared for quite awhile.  He was even nice enough to hand two of us a very hot plate, right out of the broiler.  Then he just dissapeared completely, never asking if we were ok, needed drinks, or were ready for the check. We ended up asking the busser for some boxes.  So suffice it to say, this is our last trip to El Palacio, despite how good their food can be some times."}
{"text":"Great place. Stop in for a ice cold Mexican beer and excellent dishes. Grab a drink from Roy at the bar and watch sports."}
{"text":"My husband and I really like the taco Tuesday! The beans and salsa are delicious - I have to be careful not to fill up up just on chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Chandler my entire life and I have been to just about every single Mexican food restaurant in the greater Phoenix area. This place is the best hands down! They have the best salsa and chips. Their food is great and for the price you can't beat it. If you haven't been here you owe it to yourself to try it. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, my favorite place for Mexican food in the valley! Thank you for the many years of filling my tummy with delicious food!"}
{"text":"This mexican restaurant is pretty close to my house so I gave it a couple tries. I really wanted to like this place but I just really dont. Bad service. Not so good food. Ill never go back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  The food was great.  No wait and the service was great.  No waiting they were constantly available.  Definitely gonna be back."}
{"text":"Although my kids seem to love it here,  this place is always a hit or miss.  The service is never consistent. We went in today for lunch around 2pm. It was my daughter's choice for her birthday and she invited a few friends. It didn't seem too busy as we were seated quickly with no wait. There was 10 of us,  4 adults and 6 kids.  After getting our drink orders it took a while for the server to come back to get our meal order.  I've noticed this a few times before when it didn't look busy. They only have one or two servers working the dining area but at the same time they seem to be overworked because they're under staffed. The food was great however,  we always get our fill of chips, beans, and salsa while we wait for our meal. I ordered the steak Mexicana which was delicious and cooked perfectly. Again, the server came by once to ask how everything was and if we needed refills. By the time we were done,  we had to give obvious signs we were ready for our check (hubby left with the kiddies to get situated in the car, turn on AC). The server came about 5 minutes later. Our bill wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be which made me feel a little better.  The food is good and priced right to fit my family's budget. Despite the lack of service, we will always come back. Hopefully they will work on getting it better."}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner because there was no wait. We soon realized why there was no wait, the food is terrible. I want to mention one thing good, so... the salsa was good. The service was terrible and unorganized. The decor is old and worn... I can go on and on but won't. Just stay away."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at El Palacio last night.  We usually go to Arribas, but thought we'd try something new.  We started with the house margaritas, and of course chips, salsa, and bean dip.  All of these were ok.  My husband had the Mexican flag, and I had the Verde enchilada combo (chicken) with a pork tamale.  Both of us commented right away that everything was very SALTY.  I can't say much more about the taste because everything was so salty it just overpowered any other flavor.  On the plus side, I didn't leave feeling stuffed like I usually do at a mexican restaurant, because I didn't feel compelled to eat everything on my plate.  And the mini churros with whipped cream were nice.  Service was fine, no complaints, but the food was not worth coming back for."}
{"text":"The look of the restaurant is ok and the service was meh.  I was disappointed with the tiny bit of chicken that my fajitas had.  It was mostly vegetables.  I personally wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"They start with complementary chips and salsa which include two excellent salsas and bean dip. I tried the \"Mexican flag\" for lunch, a combination of three enchiladas for just $7. Excellent value! This is a big restaurant, perfect for large groups.  Unfortunately it took my server about 15 minutes to greet me and get me a soda."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is decent. I ordered the Mexican flag enchiladas. Again, ok. The Ambience is great, the best part of my experience. Waitress was quick and checked in appropriately."}
{"text":"It's ok. If you're a vegetarian, eh... the vegetarian burrito is only beans, cheese and guacamole. The lettuce, cheese, and tomato is garnishments over the top. Not your go to for a \"good\" vegetarian burrito. Here, it's just a mouthful of beans. Salsa's are good. Drinks are ok. My husband likes the chicken chimichanga. Kids menu is ok too."}
{"text":"This is about on par for east valley chain restaurant Mexican food. Nothing spectacular but not bad. I have had a couple things here that were bad... Stay away from fried items. But the fajitas were decent and the chips and salsa can't be beat. Great prices and decent service. Overall, not a bad place to eat if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was poor. Inside of the restaurant was bright and not conducive to a pleasant eating experience. Waiter was slow and messed up my drink order. When he delivered drinks to the table he splashed it on the table. You draw your own conclusions."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was Awesome.  Love the salsa bar...so much variety.  Will be back soon :-)"}
{"text":"Craving Ceviche, and this place did cure that... Ceviche was good fresh,, not homemade which not sure if my recipe is just great, but haven't had anything better out n about...   Got the mini Chimis, and they were better than say Macayos, so thats awesome, havent been back there in LONG time, and not on any list to vist either.. The one thing about places like this are that everything comes with the staple of beans n rices... Now, i have a peeve about beans n just dislike them 100% no matter how they are cooked,,  Now, the staff were excellent, and the atmosphere ambiance, was great, so we will be here a few more times for sure when in the area,, but not a place to drive out of my way for.."}
{"text":"Traveling from CA on business. Really was hoping for good Mexican but was very dissapointed. Fajitas used sirloin steak versus true Carne asada and was over cooked. Waited 20 minutes to get a refill on my drink. Atmosphere was average. Definitely not going to return with so many options available"}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular.  Food is decent, quite pricy for what you get.  The only cool thing I like is the salsa bar that you can get a lot of varieties from.  I have been here a few times during lunch and dinner and the service is average. Have never had a great server.  Wishing there was more of a friendly vibe but the servers always seem rushed."}
{"text":"I've dined here one other time besides today and now remember why I haven't been back.  It was very slow for business, server was great and food taste was mediocre and dishes came out quick and hot.  The beans tasted liked sweet refried beans which I don't think there is such thing but they were definitely on the sweeter side.  The rice had green peas in it so know before you go.  All the salsas were bland and hot salsa was not even hot.  If you want an array of choices to choose from this could be the place for you."}
{"text":"Service was good.  I like the variety of salsas at the salsa bar.  The chips were nice and thin and crispy.  I like them lighter like that.  I had the shrimp ceviche.  Way too much cilantro, but other than that was good.  I wonder if you can ask them to hold some of that cilantro.  I would go back and try other things.  It is close to my work and at lunch time it was pretty quiet and relaxing."}
{"text":"I liked the salsa the great service. Food has wonderful flavor. I tend to be picky about what I eat but really liked the options they had for me since I don't eat meat. They were family friendly and my kids liked eating here too."}
{"text":"Went twice.  Tried to like it.  Food just wasn't that great and seemed pricey for what you got.  Good service and fast food delivery...just not a fan of the actual food.  Meh."}
{"text":"Coldest Modelo Especial in the universe..., yum yum. Oh yeah, food is great, too.  Jesse is great always friendly, knows  we love Modelo"}
{"text":"Have been here many times service is alway great food is delicious. If you are in the bar area Jesse and Jacob are the best. Super personable and take great care of you!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so close to my house and we finally got a chance to check it out!   First off, they have a huge menu! I had a hard time deciding on what to eat. I ended up getting a chicken enchilada combo. It comes with beans and rice. It was good and a very good size portion. I also ordered the house margarita which was definitely tasty and a good size as well. Also, if you check in you get a free appetizer with your entree. I ordered the guacamole which I thought was a bit bland.   The customer service was good. We literally had two waiters. The only negative for me was we sat on their patio and it definitely needs some spicing up. It's close to the intersection so it's a bit loud. I think some music would help. I also think a little waterfall or a fire pit would make it look nice. Also maybe upgrading their tables out there. Other then that everything was great!!"}
{"text":"Another outstanding El Palacio experience tonight! We can in late, and were welcomed like family by Roy!  Chips were hot & the salsas were fresh and flavorful!  The gold marguerita was delicious and strong!  Loved the green enchiladas and the cauliflower nachos with grilled chicken!  Yum! Excellent service from the waiters, and Roy checked in regularly to ensure our satisfaction.  Great food, excellent drinks, fantastic service!  Love it!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times, typically after attending Zumba events with friends, with decent experiences. On Friday, May 15, myself and a friend went here to grab a quick drink and snack following our workout. We each ordered a sangria (very good) and a Fiesta Platter appetizer plate (nachos, flautas, mini tacos, etc.) and we both specifically requested no tomatoes on it. after waiting 30 minutes, my friend had to leave, and I asked the server to make it to go, for me. The server stated that she had just put in a very large order before my one appetizer, and was sorry. My friend left, my styrofoam encased appetizer finally came, and I opened it to grab a piece to eat and noticed it....loaded with tomatoes. I gave it back to the server, who stated she would have the kitchen make \"a new one\". Waited another 10 mins for my \"new\" appetizer. Upon arriving at home about 10 mins later, I noted that the kitchen had merely picked off the tomatoes, since I noticed tomatoes scattered underneath the nachos, and the mini taco I had taken a single bite out of before the server took it back. Not to mention it was pretty cold, soggy, and unappetizing by then, after two trips to the kitchen and home.   Server was apologetic and nice, but food and service terrible. Won't be frequenting this restaurant after special events with so many other places in the same area.  I wish there was a contact or email link on their website so I could have just written directly to the manager."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a Monday night, our server Renee was very attentive with fast service. Food was great and margaritas were cheap."}
{"text":"Ordered grilled veg taco, veg burrito. It tasted like leafs and beans and they did not add cream, cheese, salsa nothing in it (no spice at all in Mexican food huh!). Didn't eat my food left the place after paying my bill. Will i recommend this place, LOL. One should try it to believe it. Probably was a bad day for me..."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour and 20 minutes to get seated; only after I talked with Chef Anthony.  Hostess (didn't get her name) was seating people before our party and they were not on the reservation list.  Another 2 couples who had 4 kids waited 1.5 hours, was laughed at my same hostess, and left after talking to Chef Anthony.  We ate dinner; nothing special and had to wait 15 minutes extra for my food which was semi-warm.  Even with longer than told wait time and issues there weren't any comps or discounts on our bill; even had to correct pricing on 1 item.  We will NOT go back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised to see all of the negative reviews about this place.   I go there quite often both by take out and sit down.     I can agree with slow service, especially on salsa refills, it seems to take forever and sometimes not even worth mentioning...   However, their food is pretty good.   I had an issue tonight with my dinner and the manager took good care of me, replaced my meals even though you could technically say it wasn't their fault.   They didn't question it, they quickly replaced it and sent me on my way."}
{"text":"Wait service was slow. Rice was hard and not fully cooked. The Chile releno and cheese enchilada was disgusting.   Will never go again."}
{"text":"After falling for their amazing carnitas at Scottsdale Spice, I badly wanted to give their restaurant a try so tada!  Saturday Night with the boys commenced!    Walking in was a treat.  El Palacio was all decked out for some Halloween fun!  The donkeys wore dinosaur pet costumes and tacky-yet-adorable vinyls covered the windows.  They also were advertising heavily that they'll be at this weekend's AZ Taco Festival.  I was mesmerized and ecstatic.  After ordering a rich horchata and getting the complimentary two bowls of salsa and a delicious homemade bean dip with some chips, I checked-in on the Yelp app and discovered a \"free appetizer with purchase of any entree\" offer.  Yes!  This night keeps getting better and better!  Our waitress had recommended us to get the Fiesta Sampler for the check-in offer since we're new patrons of the place and it was a great suggestion.  There were cheesy quesadillas, crunchy taquitos, tiny tacos with warm chorizo and potatoes, and dressed-up nachos all on this plate.  It was a lot of food and a part of me wishes they brought it out before our entrees because I was hungry and I was too busy stuffing my face with carnitas to pay too much attention to the appetizers.  Bah.   I stuck with my Carnitas Rancheras, not straying to steal bites off anyone else's plate.  It came out piping hot and smelling of delicious meats!  Three warm tortillas stayed wrapped up in their foil and were waiting for me to get my green-painted nails on them.  I piled my little tortilla up with a helping of succulent slow-cooked pork, I spooned some onions and guacamole, added my pico de gallo [sorry El Palacio, I think my pico's better], and threw on some beans and rice just because.  It was an amazing first bite.  Minus their pico de gallo being a bit wimpy, I did find that the seasoning on their carnitas to be light-handed.  Where's the heat, man!?  Make me sweat!  The portions are very generous.  Three tortillas was not enough for all that juicy meat they give you.  The free cinnamon sugar apple-filled taquito-dessert thing with whipped cream they give you with the bill was delish.  All in all, I had a great night out with good food and great company.  Service was a bit slow and the wait was pretty killer considering it wasn't even packed nor were there any big parties in the place but oh well.  Nothing great company can't cure.  I would come back for sure.  The Mole Poblano is calling my name.  Help me."}
{"text":"Favorite taco Tuesday place!! We always sit in the bar with Jacob and enjoy the salsa bar! Prices are amazing and the food is Delish! Best night of the week!"}
{"text":"Our second time there and definitely what an amazing night!! LUCAS our waiter is truly amazing  excellent service!! Thank You God Bless You"}
{"text":"2 stars at best. Unless they have stepped up their game, its very mediocre Mexican food. I have only been once but I was underwhelmed. If Im going to do a chain would rather take a trip to Gilbert  for Tia Rosa's (off Higley) better."}
{"text":"As a rule I'm not a fan of chain type Mexican restaurants as I find them to mostly be exercises in mediocrity.  That being said the food here was actually good...not great, but good.  Ordered the chimichanga and a chicken enchilada and tamale.  Both diners were good...not great, but good.  Oddly I found the beans and rice to be really good.  A minor part of both plates but both were good...maybe close to great.   Also had the house margarita.  In most cases I've found house margaritas to me overly sweet and lacking tequila.  In this case the tequila was present and the margarita mix was not overly sweet."}
{"text":"Fantastic chicken tortilla soup! Very fresh ingredients, white chicken meat, fresh not tomatoey broth, tiny tortilla strips and no cheese! Perfect!"}
