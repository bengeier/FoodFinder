{"text":"My ex-wife and I visited Peter's Pub last night in an attempt to rekindle the flame of our love. It was very crowded, which was perfect as my ex-wife has been known to instigate very loud and violent fights with me late into the night after she has been drinking. Many friends have warned me against rekindling my relationship with this woman (I once stated that she may truly be an incarnate of the devil himself) but I will hear none of it and quite frankly they can f**k right off. I had also asked the bartender not to serve her as she is recently on probation due to a misunderstanding in Louisiana, and they were very gracious. I often question if this decision is wise. My ex wife is highly intelligent, highly manipulative, and romantically demanding with a heart cold enough to freeze hell over. It remains unclear whether her bite or her bark is worse. She has the kiss of an angel and the tongue of a demon. Anyway, Peters has great service, great wings and cheap beer! 4/5 Stars."}
{"text":"Good place to go to grab a drink, was pretty crowded with people having a good time getting ready for the Steelers game. Even though it was busy here the service was really really good.       The menu was just your regular pub food from burgers to appetizers. I went with the chicken tacos they were ok not something I would recommend though. Beers on tap were mostly simple ones nothing to get excited about.        Overall this pub seems like it is an excellent place to go if your ready to start your partying."}
{"text":"Food is just ok.  Place smells like stale beer and I always seem to be cold when I am there.   Service is very slow."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food! I waited for over a half hour to get my food and I had to ask before the waitress realized she forgot my order. When I got my sandwich the chicken was dry and I didn't even finish it. Also to make matters worse they took trash through the dining area while we were eating. Have some pride."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews about this bar. It is exactly what I expected. It's a bar that serves bar food. If you want a 5 star meal go to a 5 star restaurant. If you want beer and bar food go to Peter's"}
{"text":"I decided to try Peter's Pub during Oakland's Restaurant Week. It was pretty full, but not rowdy when I went in on a Friday for lunch. Most people looked middle-aged. I got a blackened tuna steak on a bed of spinach and arugula in a roasted red pepper sauce. Everything was delicious. The fish was moist and well seasoned, and the amount of sauce was just right for the greens. I enjoyed every bite of my meal.   However, I was not as nearly impressed by the staff. I walked in, and, expecting a restaurant-type system, waited by the door. At least three servers must have seen me standing there before one told me I could just sit anywhere. After that, I had to wait a while before she came to give me the menu. She took my drink order and left before I could say that I was ready to order. While the service wasn't terrible, it wasn't the most welcoming.  Although I really enjoyed the food, my glance at the menu found mostly bar food, so I probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Peter's Pub is a decent college bar, but without the \"charm\" of nearby Hemingways. Drink prices are low, but not the lowest in town, and the same generally annoying college crowd is there.  It's actually a nice place to be during the day, but at night it transforms into a not-particularly likeable crowded smokefest where you'll wait forever for a drink.  The drinks here are good, but the prices could be better.  You'll find pretty standard college fare.  The food is decent as well, it's pretty standard bar food.  Upstairs there is an area where live bands sometimes play or it can be rented out, with its own bar.  My experience is you'll get much better service up there.  BOTTOM LINE:  There are better places.  It's a pretty standard college bar, without all the charm.  Expect crowds, with loud loud music and lots of smoke."}
{"text":"I went to this bar for the first time. Our waitress was great. Her name was ALEXANDRIA she was so friendly, professional and hard-working! She really took care of her customers well and cleaned the place up well also! We got the cardiac hill fries which had cheese and bacon on them, they were to die for, I really recommend them! We also had the buffalo chicken dip which was pretty spicy! It was good. Just ALOT and pretty heavy, definitely not for one or two people but mayb for 4 people it would be good. the buffalo chicken wrap was also spicy and i thought better than the dip. the drinks were cheap- i mean it is a college town. it was pretty empty there but the college kids were fun. they had great food and good environment I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Fries seemed like they were done already when we got them. Ostrich burgers were excellent though. Bar Tender at the time was somewhat condescending. Draft Beer was kinda warm. Sam the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Nothing better than hanging out with Browns fans on the second floor on Sundays. Cheap beer good food good times."}
{"text":"The meal: chicken wings.  The place; Peter's Pub.  The presentation was simple, yet elegant.  The plating told a story; a story from a book I would not read, but, I would see the movie."}
{"text":"Everyone loves Peter's! No, really. I don't get it either.  Service is good enough during off-hours. The waitresses are friendly and the bar service is prompt. It's a little dingy, but what do you expect from an Oakland bar?  The drink selection itself is laughable. Nothing creative and no killer, money-saving specials here. The draft beers are limited to macros with the occasional high-end import or domestic.  I'd give Peter's a higher rating if they closed during the peak hours. It's just awful then. Everyone goes to Peter's in Oakland, so expect significant crowds on Friday/Saturday nights. Don't wear nice clothes unless you want them to be covered in a mix of your sweat, other people's sweat, and drinks that'll inevitably spill on you. Also, be prepared to stand at the bar for upwards of 20 minutes to get a drink. It's that crowded.  The bouncers don't really do their job. Some dude was passed out in a chair for a half hour. I think that's grounds for being booted, but who am I to judge?  Peter's has an equally crowded bar upstairs too, with a stage area that doubles as a sizeable dance floor. Cover is free unless there's a band playing, but you probably don't want to see a shitty band at a shitty bar anyway.  Oh, and the best part is that every night a different fraternity and sorority storm the bar at around 12, doubling the crowding and wait time!  Seriously, don't go here unless you have to. There are better, cheaper bars in Oakland."}
{"text":"Well this is a dive bar in Oakland but I have always had a great meal, quick service and you cannot beat the prices.  I typically go for lunch and they have soup, salad, wraps, burgers and many other sandwiches to choose from.  On my last visit I ordered the Italian Wedding soup (soup of the day) and it was hands down one of the best wedding soups I have had!  Past visits I usually go with a wrap and they have many sides to choose from including fries, side salad and mashed potatoes (my favorite). The prices usually range from 6-8 dollars. I have also been for happy hour and they have great happy hour specials. Each day after 5pm they have special menu items for $5."}
{"text":"This, like Hemingway's down the street, is the quintessential college bar in Oakland. You always know what you're going to get here: cheap beer, young crowd, and good bad bar food. Sometimes this place is exactly what the doctor ordered- a good place to catch up with your grad student friends on campus without breaking the bank. Also a good place to catch a sports game. On the other hand, there is nothing sophisticated about this place. And of course the crowd is (really) young and loud. A unique feature about this place, however, is the free popcorn!"}
{"text":"I know this place on two different levels:  Food -- Honestly, only been here for wing nights (Mondays 9pm-11pm I think). Quality varies but they are typically satisfactory. Get the \"Kitchen Sink\" sauce... yum. Service is usually SLOW but you can't really complain with a $7 bucket of beers and free popcorn to entertain your wait times.  Bar -- College crowd.... the frat house for 21+s. Upstairs dance floor can get very crowded and will spontaneously cost a cover fee to proceed beyond the staircase. Cheap drinks, cheap drunks, and loud music. Live bands on some nights if you're into that."}
{"text":"I've been back other times and it's been better. I've only been back for lunch with coworkers but the service has been fine. I even got the buffalo chicken wrap recently and liked it a lot. I still think their drinks are pricier than other places nearby but the lunch specials are worth checking out since they are pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Used to go here a bit. Friends mixed up happy hour night and asked me to go somewhere else. Bartender said no one is doing happy hour cause of the game. I said ok and proceeded to leave anyway. Heard him tell me to \"fuck myself\" on the way out.   Great service!  Edit: every bar I walked into in that area had a happy hour that night by the way."}
{"text":"A great place to hangout with friends and get some drinks. I visit it regularly on the weekends and have always have had a great time. Being a college bar with a place to dance you can see that everyones having a great time and genuinely enjoying themselves. Would really miss the vibe at this place."}
{"text":"They have great food and the servers and bartenders are always there to help. It's on a college campus so expect the atmosphere. Don't be like that Matthew U guy and talk about how you went in college, then go back and complain about it being a college bar because that's sort of cunty. Try the kitchen sink wing sauce because it's amazing!"}
{"text":"Peter's is a pretty unassuming bar in the heart of Oakland.  How exactly did I find myself here?  It just so happens to be the home of the Pittsburgh Browns Backers.  Last Thursday, I found my way to the second floor where I was greeted by a group of Cleveland transplants such as myself.  We had a fantastic time watching our team play.  And while the Browns lost, as expected, I had a great time.  The service at the bar was excellent: friendly and prompt.  The nachos were both cheap and quite stellar.  Guacamole would have been nice, but nevertheless, the cheese was quite sharp and packed a nice little zing.  Furthermore, the price cannot be beat.  Is this a place to have a romantic dinner with your SO?  Of course not.  But if you're looking for a good, perhaps sloppy time, then sure.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"My friend got punched in the face by a grown man at this bar and ended up in the hospital while the staff let the guy go. Same night there was a man passed out in the stairwell blocking the hall for an extended period of time. Wish I could give it negative stars. Do not go here."}
{"text":"I love peter's pub. It's your friendly, local college bar, with friendly bartenders and a scrumptious pub menu. The daily happy hour special from 5-7pm which rotates from burgers, to wraps and appetizers. There's a simple selection of beers on tap and in a bottle and hanging growler's on the wall which you should totally ask about.  Food is totally affordable for which you get a good sized portion. If you don't sit at the bar, the dining room has been redone in the past couple years to have a bunch of cool booths. However, if you catch a second at the bar, you can engage in friendly conversation of current and alumni pitt bar goers, for all whom Peter's has been a staple in Oakland memory. If you're lucky, you can even ask the owner himself about how Oakland has changed over time. After all, it's been a few decades. Some of my favorites included a lot of bonding of good friends and drowning my best friend in shots when her drunk bf [now husband] decided to mistakenly change his facebook status to single.   If you get here at night, the bar may become a tad crowded as Peter's is a staple spot for many a 21st birthday candidate, coming to gather their Viking horns or a bunch of dancers looking for the 2nd floor stage.  All in all, make a stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yesterday, I celebrated meeting an important deadline by having a drink with CM at Peter's after work.  As an Oakland bar in close proximity to Pitt, I wouldn't consider visiting Peter's during the academic year.  However, the summer provides the perfect opportunity to visit bars like Peter's without being overrun by undergrads and made to feel my age.  Having heard that Peter's served flaming pie shots ($6) from my lab manager, I of course had to try one, given that I'm a sucker for drink gimmicks involving fire.  Although CM and I were seated at a table, our waitress informed us that I should head over to the bar to get one.  Although slightly annoying, this provided me with the opportunity to watch my drink be flamed, unlike a similar drink that I'd ordered at Industry Public House over the weekend, which was brought to my table already smoked.  It was cool to watch, esp. when the bartender sprinkled cinnamon over top of the flame, causing it to flare up.  Just be sure to blow it out before drinking it if you order one!  Since I was hungry, we took advantage of a happy hour special and ordered two chicken tacos ($2.50 each) and a side order of Cajun fries ($2).  Despite being dressed with salsa verde, the tacos were super bland, so I dressed them up with some mustard (weird, I know) and hot sauce to add flavor.  (Great tacos can be found at Las Palmas on Atwood two blocks away.)  The fries were your standard pre-formed variety, lightly battered and then sprinkled with Cajun seasoning, which was spicy but not very flavorful.  At least one of the fries was underdone, such that the interior was raw when I bit into it.  At the time of our visit, the clientele was quite varied, ranging from an older couple to grad students and undergrads, and from regulars to newbies (that would be us!).  Although our waitress was often busy chatting up another table (friends of hers or regulars, I'm guessing), she was friendly and responsive when we got her attention walking from there to the bar/kitchen to order.  I didn't detect any obvious cigarette smoke at the time of our visit.  Overall, Peter's fit the bill as a place for quick and cheap after work drink and grub, but I wouldn't go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Sadly, I've outgrown this place.  At least when it comes to a place to hang out at.  With that it's just a reminder that I'm getting older.    I came here after work one night to meet a few people.  It was close for us all, and probably the best pick.  There aren't that many bars in Oakland to choose from.  What I walked into was a country night college fiasco, and to make it weirder, they were doing some samba or salsa dancing upstairs.  Rowdy and inconsiderate college kids everywhere.  Makes me wonder if I was that bad back when I was in college.  Service was slow at times.  They do have servers roaming the floor looking to see if you need anything, but the whole time our group was at our table, we never had a visit.  At the bar I swear the only person I say there 100% of the time was the bar back.  You'd have to wave him down to go find a bartender.    I left there with a different view of this place than I did years ago.  I may return to this place in time to try their food fare during daylight hours, but never again to enjoy an after work drink."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. The WORST bar in Oakland. All the employees are stuck up and rude, not sure how the expect tips? Everyone there is awful. They don't put alcohol in the drinks and the employees are AWFUL. NEVER GO"}
{"text":"cool place to watch sports during the day, gets a little douchey at night."}
{"text":"Used to go to this bar a lot when I was in college.  They always had some pretty good specials.  The one I remember the best was penny pitchers...not sure that they still do that though :-)"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about Peter's Pub. We went tonight with a group of people, and had a range of experiences. Our waitress was friendly and helpful. She brought us water for the half hour prior to happy hour. The happy hour beer specials are really the big pro for Peter's. It's $2.50 for any beer on tap, and the tap list is pretty good for a local Oakland bar. They always have Magic Hat #9, they seem to have a good seasonal Leinenkugel when I'm there, and today they had the Great Lakes Christmas (a personal favorite for the season). The downsides are the food and location. Like all things Oakland, it's packed when school is in session and busy during rush hour (but great over the holidays and summer). Oakland parking is even more of a pain lately, as all street parking is either meter or 1 hour max. My provolone sticks weren't anything special, but they did hit the spot. The turkey burger was a plain patty with a slice of tomato and piece of lettuce. Very far from something special. If you're looking for somewhere casual to grab a beer for happy hour, I recommend it. But if you're hungry for something special, head somewhere else."}
{"text":"One of Oakland's signature establishments, getting viking horns on their 21st birthday at Peter's is a must for Pitt Students' bucket lists. Favored by Pitt's Greek Life, Peter's has three main areas: a dining area to entrance left, a bar area to entrance right, and a dance floor upstairs. You're unlikely to get into this bar if you're using a fake ID, unless it's a good one, or unless you're in with the bouncers. Peter's offers daily specials, friends and I were fans of SUPER cheap Monday night wings and beer. When I mean cheap, I mean cheap - these wings are and not particularly special/delicious, but it does the trick for the college pocket and appetite.  Weekend nights, and select weeknights (depending on when in the semester) are wild at Peter's. It will be difficult to wade your way through the drunk and horny masses. Having an attractive friend may help you get the bartenders' attentions sooner. Peter's is the move for crazy nights, when all you want is to drink and dance. Good luck having a conversation with the noise."}
{"text":"This bar mostly has pitt students. You won't find a lot of CMU people in here except if they have the upstairs section rented out. The upstairs section is pretty big and has a decent bar. It does take a bit to get a drink at the bar and is usually really crowded on a friday or saturday. They also do have the NFL package here and Eagle fans usually go here to watch football."}
{"text":"Had their beef stew sourdough bowl, and it was just okay. It was a nicely sized portion for lunch, with plenty of stew and having the bread around it to fill up the rest. It was fine but rather dull for the most part. There were quite a lot of beef cubes, though the Guinness Au Jus that it was served in tasted like any other gravy. There also weren't a lot of vegetables in the stew to complement the beef, and it certainly felt like the stew was largely premade and just heated up to be served. The bread was fine, though not as strong tasting as sourdough usually is. Service was fine, and the overall environment seems fine for a drink and perhaps their other food if they make those better."}
{"text":"Service is average, but food is great. I recommend the California Reuben Wrap. And their fries are fantastic. Drinks are overpriced. Exactly what you'd expect from a collegetown bar. Sometimes on weekend nights, bartenders (upstairs especially) can be a bit unfriendly. However, I always go back."}
{"text":"After asking for a red fishbowl, the bartender served me a drink that tasted like a strong syrup.  Then, I asked a different bartender if he could remake the drink, and he refused to make the drink.  He said I needed to ask the original bartender, which made no sense because he failed to make the drink properly in the first place.  Then, the original bartender claimed the previous version of the drink I had must have just been \"vodka and fruit punch\" and refused to remake the drink. TLDR: The bartenders are atrocious.  Skip this bar at all costs."}
{"text":"Drank an afternoon away here on a recent weekend trip to the 'Burgh.  Have stayed in Oaktown twice, and both times spent a weekend afternoon drinking some cheap beers here. Have not eaten here, nor have I experienced the college crowd to which others have alluded. Service is fine.  Overall, a decent place to while away an afternoon and watch sports on the tube."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review from the perspective of a grad student in Oakland.  I haven't really gone here in the evenings as much as I've hit it up for lunch (and perhaps some lunch beers), so I'm primarily commenting on the food and not so much how fun it is as a bar.  The food is very reasonably priced - pretty inexpensive I'd say.  It's pretty standard bar food, and pretty good.  Not amazingly good, but good enough to keep me coming back.  I enjoyed the buffalo chicken salad (with fries of course!) I had this past Friday. It was only $7 (compared to the one I had for dinner last night at $14 at another restaurant).  They also typically have cider on tap, which is always a plus for me."}
{"text":"Total college bar - it was nostalgic just walking in and I didn't even go here when I was in college!    The drinks were cheap and the crowd is a bit young but that's what should be expected going to a bar in the middle of Oakland.    Tried the kitchen sink wings - wish they were a bit spicier but they weren't bad.  If you're in the area check it out, but I wouldn't recommend making a special trip."}
{"text":"If you want a legit college town experience go to Peter's Pub.  If you're out of the college scene (as I am) you can still enjoy Peter's for lunch.  If you're in college, go there at night and have some drinks (and for your 21st birthday go here for your horns).  The menu is stacked with pretty typical 'bar food' options, however, I had a really tasty, and quite healthy, berry salad for lunch.  My friends and I shared an order of homemade potato chips with French onion dip.  Delish!    On previous visits I've enjoyed their sandwich wraps.  I know they also have some nice happy hour specials.  Service is decent and the atmosphere is relaxed.  Makes me glad I work for a University and can transport myself to my college days by going to Peter's.....this time as an adult who orders iced tea and salad, but still, I can reminice..."}
{"text":"I came here to get my horns for my 21st birthday. I was told by multiple bartenders that they were simply, \"bar backs,\" as I asked to be served. I then witnessed them pouring entire pitchers of beer for other customers. It's a Pitt tradition to go here for your 21st, but the $10 minimum for a credit/debit card is relatively shady and seems to be an attempt to deceive customers into purchasing more alcohol. I obtained the cliche birthday experience, but received no incentive to return -- especially with the South Side only a cheap Uber ride away."}
{"text":"Turn 21 here And get your viking horns, kid! Then never come back."}
{"text":"University of Pittsburgh Greeks, you've found your frat house! Peter's Pub located at 116 Oakland Avenue has been a long time favorite of Panther frats and sororities. Like many bars in Oakland the downstairs drinking area is a bit cramped, but unlike many of the other Oakland bars Peter's Pub has a spacious upstairs area with another bar and a stage for live music.  The beer selection here isn't all that great, most patrons usually have a miller or bud lite bottle in hand. I, being a fan of higher quality draft beer was disappointed to see not too much of a draft selection. I was even more irked at the prices; Peter's Pub is one of the more expensive bars in Oakland.  Peter's has a number of gimmick nights to draw in customers. Country night seems to be a favorite, but since I'm not much of a country fan it didn't really thrill me. Anyways, what the music industry seems to market as country these days sounds a lot more of pop rock with a banjo.   Though the live entertainment on certain nights includes many local live bands, Peter's Pub usually charges a cover. The cover is all that expensive, but it's just the fact that other bars in Oakland tend to not ask for a cover charge which annoys me.   In many ways it seems like Peter's Pub has seemed to confuse itself with a type of bar that is usually found in the South Side. I have no problem with South Side bars, many of them are great places, but it's more of the fact that Peter's Pub just doesn't fit into the neighborhood of Oakland. Instead of being a refreshing change of pace, it seems to merely be a classic college bar posing as something hipper."}
{"text":"This place just keeps getting worse.  This is the second time I've had to downgrade my rating of Peter's, and it'll be my last update, as I won't be returning.  The attention with which they prepare food has been steadily declining for years, to the point where every time you walk in it's a roll of the dice.  You might get someone in the kitchen who cares about making your order properly, and you might not.  They've also started only intermittently enforcing the \"no smoking\" rule.  For me, this means that on any given day the place will contain experience-ruining smoke (or worse, you'll sit down, thinking you're safe, and then people will start smoking as soon as you get your food).  But if you're a smoker, you're out of luck too, because on seemingly random days, you'll be told to put it out.  So it's not a reliably desirable experience for either part of the population.  Also, seriously, and I've said this before, how hard is it to not burn my hamburger?  You know how the old saying goes: \"Fool me once, shame on you.  Burn my hamburger a lot and allow people to start smoking when I'm two bites in, I'm never coming back to your stupid bar again.\""}
{"text":"This place is worse than a typical college bar.  I have been here on a Friday evening and the place is trashed.  The place is messy, no organization, not very clean whatsoever.  The bartenders seemed rude to me probably because I am a guy.  They have over priced drinks and not even all the beers most bars have.  I asked for a pretty basic beer, Shocktop, did not have it.  Not a great place to go.  Better bars around campus."}
{"text":"Calling Pitt my home for 4 years, you'd think I'd have had at least one experience at Peter's Pub, however, this past Saturday was the first time I have ever stepped foot inside. This was a dive bar,obviously catering to students. Since there was a basketball game in about an hour, there was a variety of ages present at the bar. If there was not a game, I'd venture to say that my boyfriend and I would have been the oldest ones in there (and I'm not even 30 yet yikes!). We barely made it in the door because all of the St. Bonaventure fans must have found out about Peter's being extremely cheap and they were hunkered at the bar and all of the tables. Now my boyfriend had been there before and while we did get our first beers downstairs (although it took at least 10 minutes to get served), we carried them upstairs and lo and behold, there were maybe 5 other people at the upstairs bar so we just stayed up there and had another drink after the first. I don't feel the need to ever come back to be honest, I may end up here again, only if going to a game at the Pete, but I prefer a little less rowdy now that I'm in the latter half of my 20s so I'd probably do The Porch for drinks next time before the game instead."}
{"text":"Greek central. Not bad, pretty much a frat bar, but decent atmosphere otherwise. It's a pretty cool thing to get your horns for your 21st. lots of fun with huge groups. I enjoy dancing here sometimes. If you come on the weekend, which you most likely will, just be aware it's like any college bar: crowded, hordes of drunks, etc. Basically what you'd expect.   However, during the day, I saw my own server doing shots at another table. I'd get it if your shift was over and it was a tough day. But when I tried getting her attention, she said she'd be right back and went to do a couple shots with her friends before coming back to get our orders. If you're gonna do that, don't do it where customers can see...and at least get the customer(s) taken care of first."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed in the bartenders. This place would be great if their bartenders were friendly. I'm honestly shocked at how rude they were to customers, and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Simple college bar. Cheap drinks, good food. I probably wouldn't go on a weekend in fear of the crowds of freshly 21 year olds and kids who can't handle their alcohol. Heard this from locals and from what I saw of the few people sitting at the bar. But on a Tuesday night after a long drive, the $6 pitcher and good food with food prices, we were happy with Peters."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thirsty Thursday, and boy was this place hopping.  The upstairs was packed with people dancing and going crazy.  I would say that out of all the bars I went to that night, Peter's had the best atmosphere for hanging out and dancing your night away.."}
{"text":"You'll see people walking around in viking hats in Oakland, and if you don't know the story (or are under 21), you're probably wondering, \"Where's the costume party?\"  When you or one of your friends turn 21, it's a tradition to go to Peter's and \"get your horns\" (a free viking hat). It's carnival-prize quality. If you can't get their attention or they can't hear you, the bartenders recognize the sign of putting your fingers up by your head like bull horns that you want a hat. They only check your ID outside, and not at the bar where they give out the horns. Some of my friends have three hats.   College students go here to drink and dance. Weekend nights they charge $1 cover (sometimes), and another $1 to get upstairs (sometimes). Weeknights there are specials, like $5 fishbowls on Wednesdays with country music. They also have a free popcorn machine. People usually dance on the weekends. Upstairs is the dance floor with a different DJ and smaller bar. The upstairs  \"bouncer\" lets people in whenever he feels like it (e.g. 15 people might leave but apparently it's still too full to let people in).   It'll remind you of a frat party with the type of guys who come and try to grab and dance up on the ladies. There are also some guys who follow the ladies around the dance floor, even if it's apparent they're trying to escape. But I guess you get creepers anywhere you go. It's one of the two or three drinking establishments in Oakland that have dance floors.  Afternoons normally have older patrons drinking at the bar or eating food. It's bar food rather than pub food. The kitchen is open until 10pm.   I saw a bride there one night, in her wedding gown with her wedding party.  Crowd 2/5 Food 3/5 Atmosphere 3/5  If you're bar hopping, put Peter's on your list."}
{"text":"A great big Thank You to the management of Peter's Pub for hosting the Pittsburgh Hash House Harriers Annual Green Dress Run!    A bigger THANK YOU goes to the staff of Peter's Pub for putting up with 100 or so people drinking, singing and making utter fools of themselves all while wearing green dresses!  We managed to raise $698 (after expenses) for the Animal Rescue League of Western PA and much of the success of this fund raiser can be attributed to the good people of Peters Pub!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in awhile and made a stop in last night.  Apparently this has turned into a smoking bar.  I find this odd since they also serve food (the kitchen hadn't closed yet) and I thought that was against the law.  This place reeks of cigarette and cigar smoke, so I will not be returning.  The service wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"I have never been to Peter's Pub in the 4 years that I have worked in Oakland. I always walked past it but never made the commitment to go in.  Our group picked it for this day because there was a parking spot right in the front. Yeah, it was as simple as that. We walked in and no one was at the front so we just walked towards the tables. From the bar someone spoke to us just saying, \"sit anywhere you want.\" Soon after we were seated our waitress came over and took our drink order.   Happy news!! We were told that since we had a party of 4 or more we got a free appetizer! That is pretty exciting.   I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with a side salad and sweet potato fries. I always will pick sweet potato fries because I love them so much. I was not disappointed. :-) Our group also ordered the meatloaf special, and dessert for lunch.   1. Meatloaf-- This meatloaf was really good. I got to taste a bite and I was a bit jealous that it wasn't my meal. It had a bit of a sweeter taste to it, something that I was not prepared for, yet still really good. It was juicy and feel apart easily. Yum!  2. The bite of brownie sundae was ok. I mean it was a brownie, so yum. But it tasted a little dry. I wouldn't order it again, but if I was offered a bite I would take it.   3. Appetizer platter. It had onion rings, zucchini slices, stuffed jalapeño, mozzarella stick (only one??), and chicken strips (two). I will say that this platter was heavy on the onion rings and zucchini slices. I would have preferred more of an even mixture. A platter is to be shared so having only a few of the \"good\" things really makes it difficult to not feel some type of way when you don't get any jalapeños or a mozzarella stick. (I still am upset.)   4. Main meal: Grilled chicken-- The side salad was large and wonderful. I really enjoyed the fact that the lettuce was not just iceberg lettuce. It was a nice spring mix. Yum. The sweet potato fries were plentiful and fried just correctly. Now onto the chicken sandwich. I asked for onions on it. They came sautéed--weird right?? But that can be ignored. I was not that impressed by the bun. Everything else was good but the bun was not thick enough. The bun was all soggy by the time I got it. I am not a fan of soggy buns. If the bun was thicker I think the sandwich would have been really good, aside from the sautéed onions.   I don't know if I would come again, but it is a possibility."}
{"text":"College bar with MLB package, they put the Nationals game on for us since it was summer and they were pretty empty. Okay beer selection but was perfect being able to see the game."}
{"text":"Nice beer tap selection- but the bartenders are RUDE!! Our bartender had a bad attitude and rolled here eyes whenever we called her for something. This would be a great place, but the bartenders are pretty awful!!! So rude, that we left much earlier than we intended too Bc we didn't enjoy the side of attitude with our food & drinks."}
{"text":"This place BLOWS. If I could give is zero stars, I would.   I came here with friends, and ordered a basic mixed drink which tasted lousy. I asked the waitress if the bartender could fix it. She told me she'd take it over to him so could taste it first. Um, taste it?? WTH? I told her to keep it, and we ended up leaving after the bartender also decided to turn up the music loud enough to nearly blow out the windows. And there were only like 8 people in the bar.  So if you want to drink, go to the state store and take your purchase home. Cozy up on your couch, play a little music... stare at your toes, channel surf... all that random stuff is guaranteed to provide for a better time."}
{"text":"I give it a three. Surprisingly, this is not a bad place to watch a few games on one of their screens and they have a decent selection of brews. Food's okay and served relatively quickly. I have to agree with some of the others that the bartenders occasionally get too engrossed in their conversations with particular patrons, but I've not experienced anything ridiculous yet. I'll keep going."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. There are so many places to eat in Pittsburgh, I would eat somewhere else. Drinks are cheap though, if you're looking for a bar to hang out with friends then I'll come here. There are many times I came here for food and I always left disappointed. I tried their sandwich and wrap previously. So this time I decided I will just get appetizers because it's hard to go wrong, I got mozzarella cheese sticks. They brought it out to me without the marinara sauce, just moz sticks on a small plate. What? I once again left disappointed.."}
{"text":"What to say about Peter's Pub... without potentially offending Lauren C:)  I'd classify this as a dive bar in Oakland.  Whenever I'm at a bar in Oakland I worry I'll be thee oldest person there.  Thankfully, this doesn't happen at Peters.  Lost of different age brackets are hitting up this bar.  Is it for the free popcorn?  Who knows!  All I know are that the drinks are cheap and the DJ is admittedly pretty awesome!  I've never eaten here before, but I can bet they have bar food.  I know, far stretched, right?  I've seen a lot of 21st birthday's stroll through here (of course) and you get to wear a fun viking hat.  I'd hit this up just for that...and potentially lie about my age just for a hat..."}
{"text":"Came here for wing night with a couple of good friends and had a blast. Monday nights from 9-midnight are $0.45 per wing and they have a ton of different delicious flavors. The beers were good too. Good company. Good atmosphere. Good food. That's all you can really ask for."}
{"text":"I warn you: Wednesday is Country Night. If you don't like Country, make sure a friend doesn't drag you here Wednesday.   Don't say I didn't warn you.  Good sized bar menu, I didn't mind the place."}
{"text":"I would give this no stars if I could. I'm from out of town and I stopped here for lunch because I had a meeting close by later. Since I was by myself I sat at the bar. The bartender was an ass. His buddies were at the bar and he poured their beer and poured one for himself also. It's 12noon and your working and drinking while on the clock. Why the hell are you knocking back beers and not serving guest who are coming in for lunch. I had to ask for my water 3 times and ask for cocktail sauce 2x. Also, while sitting at the bar you have a good view if the kitchen. I saw the cook stick his nose in the ziplock back to smell the chicken. He kept sniffing it. Clearly, the chicken was not fresh if you have to really 2nd and 3rd guess it. He put the chicken on the salads. Hope those people didn't get sick. Plus he didn't even have gloves on when he stuck his hand in the bag of chicken. Oh course I noticed this after I ate my (frozen) fried shrimp platter. Just plain nasty this place is. I'd rather stave next time then come to this place again."}
