{"text":"Very good shawarma. You can order small or large, which doesn't refer to size but instead amount of filling, so large = more chicken. Very tasty and everything is fresh. On the shawarma scale of life it's a 7/10 for me because as much as there are many flavours altogether and overall it's a great wrap, I was missing the punch of that shawarma seasoning or whatever it is, even though you've got your tahini, hot sauce and tzatziki in there. As per the other reviews the owner is indeed friendly - made a great first impression and I will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome shawarma and kabob! I've been 3 or 4 times, ordering something different every time, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. The owner is incredibly nice and truly passionate about his customers. Large portions, so come hungry."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant thinking it was the previous pizza shop but looked like they closed down and opened Safaryan.

The owner was very kind and gave us some background information about him and his family's shop. It's a new Afghan cuisine restaurant with some Canadian faves such as Poutine and pizza. 

The shawarma Poutine was awesome! I know we'll definitely going back for the Poutine again. The gravy was the right consistency and the taste was bang on. 

I wasn't too fond of the shawarma plate I ordered. The potatoes needed more seasoning and the salad did not taste all that fresh. The portion was tooooo big for one person, I recommend sharing if you do get it.

Overall, if you're looking for a chill place with a quick bite to eat, this is your place!"}
