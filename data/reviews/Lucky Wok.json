{"text":"What looks like a dive turns out to be a huge splash.  Almost everything I have ordered has been outstanding and left me wanting more.  The sweet and sour chicken was a little off for my taste, but might just be me.  Mongolian chicken was to die for and the Lo Mein is some of the best in town."}
{"text":"I enjoy lucky Wok. It's NOT the greatest but in a moment of craving, it satisfies the urge for Chinese. I love the general Taos chicken and pork fried rice. The Shrimp chips are usually stale which is disappointing but the food is affordable and quickly made. I recommend the egg rolls too-yummy."}
{"text":"Best chinese around. 100% authentic and its cheap. Everything I've had here has been flavorful and delicious."}
{"text":"Very good for late night Chinese food. I really enjoyed the general Tsos, Lo mein and the wontons"}
{"text":"I just ordered delivery from this app and it has taken them an extra 30 min from the delivery time listed (that was already 40-50 min) this is an absolutely ridiculous wait for Chinese food and after calling twice the employee was rude and kept telling me it was busy and \"10 more min\". I'm okay with waiting, I understand a busy night but they should definitely tell someone when it's going to take an hour and a half to get wonton soup. Please save yourself the time and don't order from this place."}
{"text":"Quite possibly some of the best Chinese food we've had yet in the Valley - can't believe it took almost 3 years to find this place!  Don't let the outside fool you, this place is definitely worth it.  We stumbled across this place by accident one night, as we were looking for late Chinese take-out, and our usual choice was mysteriously closed with no rhyme or reason.  It's not that close to us, but nothing here seems to be, but we figured it was inexpensive, so we'd give it a try.  Well, we've been back three times since!  We've had the orange chicken combo plate and the house lo mein twice from here, it's been hot, delicious, and cooked perfectly.  Fried rice is basic, but, I'm not expecting miracles from any take out Chinese place in this city.  Spring rolls are crispy, and not greasy at all.  Looking forward to trying more off the menu soon!"}
{"text":"No no no. Never again. Their food is a joke. Even non Chinese myself can make better than this. There are no flavor in meat at all. I guess they dont ever marinate or season them. Luckily my wife did liked the lo mein. Im leaving 2 star."}
{"text":"Perfect little late night spot after a long flight. Egg drop soup is a hell yeah. Veggie spring rolls were completely cold. That made me sad. If people are coming here expecting an immaculate, perfect experience, they're cute. Super cool little hole in the wall spot to me. I expected the homeless neighbor, posted up in the back, to be off putting, but he seemed very nice. No food poisoning as of yet, but I expected it at first from looking at the place. Little bit of a language barrier with the woman working there. No biggie."}
{"text":"I ordered a variety of things from here since there were no reviews. I got egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, and curried vegetables.  My only complaint about the egg drop soup was that it had corn in it. Seemed bizarre. The soup was thin, instead the egg-like consistency some have. It had really great flavor.  I had never seen curried vegetables before on a menu. They sauce tasted mostly like they used curry powder to make it. It was decent.   The Mongolian beef was exactly as you would expect. Sesame chicken was good too. Nothing special, but good. The fried rice was delicious. The lo mein wasn't exactly as I'm used to but I actually liked it more than traditional lo mein. While it didn't contain any veggies, it was less oily than normal and had an unexpected garlic flavor to it that was really pleasant. My bf said it was his favorite part.  Overall I'd definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Nope!!! Never again. Bland! Bland! Bland! I don't understand how it's possible to screw up Chinese food this badly.   I ordered my food on Saturday night, 12/23/17. I ordered the house lo mein, the sesame chicken, the pork lo mein, and the Mongolian beef. Everything tasted as if the same ingredients were used in every dish - but the flavors were so bland. The most noticeable ingredient in every item was the jarred, minced garlic. I hate that stuff!! It was used in abundance and it was the only real flavor in the food. They didn't even taste like they added any soy sauce or other Asian flavors like ginger or sesame oil.   You're better off making your own Chinese food at home even if you have no experience with Asian ingredients. I can pretty much guarantee your food will still come out better."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I had to. I tried this place tonight only Chinese place near me still open. & it is amazing. Best Chinese food I've had in a while. The people working I assume were the owners a man and women were kind and even gave us extra crab Rangoons. The chicken fried rice is to die for.  I will definitely be back to this place. No need to look for a good Chinese restaurant anymore. And they are also open till 2 am."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The owners are always super nice and accommodate my weird picky requests without any issues. I also love that they're open late because I work odd hours. The food is straightforward and delicious. I only wish they had a pupu platter!"}
{"text":"Seems the bad reviews are mostly related to delivery issues except for the one guy who complained about canned garlic.  Well things don't always go smoothly when ordering delivery and guy, 3 of the 4 things you ordered ARE made with mostly the same ingredients.   I'm here on a long weekend getaway and after not having food all day due to the fiancee having an unplanned emergency surgery I left the hospital and found this place on the way home from the hotel at midnight.  I ordered hot and sour soup, crab wontons, and hpise moo shoo.  The soup wasn't my favorite but it was good, the wontons were great, they didn't make it home. The moo shoo was exactly as it should be.  This hit the spot and the fact I was able to get it this late made all the difference.  I knew once seeing the building that it was going one way or the other, turns out it was excellent. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I ordered Kung Pao chicken, and it tasted like nothing. The vegetable spring rolls were too ginger-y. The fried rice was white rice with soy sauce on it. I haven't tried the soup yet, but I'm not optimistic."}
{"text":"This last weekend we stayed at a hotel 2 miles away from here, and were recommended this place by the concierge. Big mistake! We ordered the family dinner special and an order of crab puffs at 7:13pm. Our order wasn't delivered until 9:15, and was missing the included fried rice and side of Crab Puffs we ordered, so we called to have them deliver those.   After hearing nothing for an hour, we called again at 10:30 and were told that the delivery driver had just left 10 minutes prior. Finally, after calling it quits and going to bed, the driver finally arrived at 11:30 with our fried rice. We never got our Crab Puffs.  I highly discourage anyone from ordering delivery from this place."}
{"text":"Lucky Wok is a Chinese take-out place with a handful of tables in the front.  While the tables and chairs are better than expected, the restaurant is really not suited for dining in.  Cheap plastic spoons, forks, and knives are provided in plastic quart-size containers on each table, and the wonton soup was disappointingly served in a little Styrofoam bowl, kind of like something you would have for tailgating.  At least the main dishes came out on actual plates.  And speaking of tailgating, the dining area was freezing cold.  The only upside was the television in the corner picking up over-the-air network broadcasts to keep my mind off the temperature and my rapidly cooling food.  Food is ordered from the universal, standard-issue Chinese take-out menu and tastes just about as unexciting.  The Chicken with Mushrooms had decent sauce but pretty low-quality bits of chicken and not many mushrooms.  The Roast Pork Fried Rice was on par with what you would get at a mall food court.  If you're willing to drive a little further west on Walker Road, I'd recommend skipping Lucky Wok and going to Mark Pi's China Gate, which carries a lot of the same dishes but with a little uptick in quality."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken lo mein  pork lo mein and crab puffs. The food was amazing, quantity was perfect and flavoring was on point, we will be eat her regularly as we've been searching for good Chinese food for a long time! Will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I live right across the street from here.  I got egg drop soup and kung pao vhickeb to go.  The soup was ok and did not have corn.  The kung pao chicken just as others desribed....bland and 95 percent vegatables with almost no meat.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"Wow this place sucked! Even though it was take out, it shouldn't of been this bad! I ordered the orange chicken, wontons, and a few spring rolls the only thing that was ok was the spring rolls. And those were probably store bought! Never will eat there again!"}
{"text":"We love this place and it's our go to take out Chinese restaurant. It's cheap and the quality is decent. They have a triple spice dish we love."}
{"text":"This review is targeted at the customer service. Each time I order online my card gets declined.  I pay in cash instead.    The owner calls every time with an attitude about the card declining, asking if I'm still paying. I've told him twice something is wrong with their site but he says \"I don't know what's wrong, can't fix it.\"  If the site doesn't work, don't have it as an option to place orders.   Food is pretty good, most recent order of General Tso was a bit fatty.   I don't know if I'm going to order again.  I don't like getting an attitude from the manager  about their business having an issue."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Ordered the beef lo mein and orange chicken (last Tuesday).  Will be coming back and ordering from them again soon"}
{"text":"I love this place. My coworker and I found this when we were hungry working late. They are so nice every time we call in orders."}
{"text":"Ordered from here a handful of times and the food is very good. Eating the Beef Pan Fried Noodles as we speak and they are excellent. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"In the land of Chinese food you truly never know what you're going to get in Arizona. So over the years, when order Chinese delivery I stick to the main stays. We order delivery through Beyond Menu and after submitting the order the website populated with an estimated delivery time of 40-50 minutes.   Well 1 hour and 25 minutes later the food arrived. The delivery driver took an additional 3 minutes verifying my credit card information that he had written down and then left. Annoyed & Hangry I made the very short trek to my kitchen to fix a plate. Everything was lukewarm at best!!!! While I don't expect steam, I feel it's a realistic expectation that barring getting food from a Papa Murphys type place that I shouldn't have to heat delivery food up. The Sesame Chicken had all of the sauce on the bottom, which left this weird mushy and chewy chicken nugget balls that lacked any real flavor. The fried rice was completely absent of all of the things that make fried rice great, onions, peas, egg or any type of protein. The spring rolls aside from the fact that they were cold were so greasy and bland that even a fat kid would tap out.   In short, in the land of Phoenix Lucky Wok is not a good bet for Chinese American Cuisine."}
{"text":"Their crab puffs are AMAZING. I've been here three times and every time I get the beef with broccoli with no complaints! My boyfriend has tried a different thing every time and has enjoyed his food too. It looks sketchy BUT it's the best little hole in the wall find."}
{"text":"I'm 26 weeks pregnant and I was desperately craving pork lo mein. My boyfriend saw that this place was open and close by and decided to take a chance and holy cow, I'm glad he did. Without having been there myself, I could tell that the wok my noodles were stir fried in was very well seasoned, just by the color. The entire dish was very flavorful, definitely the best I've had since we moved to Phoenix. My boyfriend said that the place was very clean and well maintained, I'll take his word for it. He also said that a woman was sitting in there making fresh crab puffs, I'm glad we got to try those too. They were good! I will definitely be going back (or begging my boyfriend to get some for me)."}
