{"text":"Tasty, creative vegetarian food. Menu has a wide selection. The deserts were awsome (especially the caramel cake). The service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Really superior Chinese food, and superior vegetarian Chinese food.  And I eat out a lot, and am vegetarian.  The veg wonton soup had a superior tasty broth.  Won-ton were undercooked, but the hard part is creating tasty broth.  My eggplant, tofu and snow peas was SUPERB.  Glazed tofu was savory, with a crunchy exterior and soft interior, and delicious. The pan-fried noodles with bokchoy was delicious.  Really, really enjoyed the superior food."}
{"text":"Decoration \"fancy\" mais prix de casse croute, bon service, deux sections vitrée pour reservation, ce n'est pas un café.. le nom du resto est trompeur.. bouffe correcte."}
