{"text":"Amazing food made from fresh ingredients. Relaxing environment to dine in. Very nice interior. Most of the times I order the Zayatoon Pizza as it is one the best pizzas in town. The staff are trained well, they are polite, professional and respectful. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant about a month ago. The décor atmosphere is nice.  The dishes were good but some were over seasoned but alright. The service was exceptionally slow. I would say they really need to work on their service and their waiter etiquette and they will attract more customers. So overall, food and décor are okay, taking off a star because did not enjoy the service.."}
{"text":"Now this is a Persian restaurant I have eaten at a few times and every time they have wow'ed me! The decor is tasteful and atmosphere is very comfortable. The staff is very polite, friendly and attentive. Best of all, the food is very tasty and in very generous portions. Must try their Kashke Bademjan appetizer, which is Eggplants with Persian whey sauce garnished with finely chopped garlic, onion and herbs. Must also try Kuku Bagheli & Shevid which is Fava bean and dill frittata & Wed-Sun they also have Khoresht Fesenjan: Pomegranate Paste, Walnut, Chicken & Basmati rice --one of my favourites!"}

{"text":"My wife and i both love middle eastern food and visited Zaytoon in the 1st month it opened.  The interior is a nice update from the aging steakhouse it replaced (Eddie' Steakhouse).  The service was slow, aloof and disorganized  - it was evident that most servers were new at their role.   We received our appetizers well after our main course and the server was very nervous.  The menu definitely needs work.  There is a small section on an odd selection of middle east choices; the balance is a mish mash of pub food - hamburgers, chicken wings, hotdogs, and such. The food was simply okay - a bit greasy actually.  Zaytoon is Perisna for Olive. We can only hope the the overload on oil was from olives.  A few weeks later we decided to try it again (we live in the neighbourhood) hoping they were over their opening night jitters.  Our server recommend their pizza saying that Persian pizza rivals that of the best Italian restaurants.  I ordered the Zaytoon Pizza on his reco - vegetables with sausage.  when i received my pizza i was horrified to find that sausage was sliced up wiener hotdogs.  My wife ordered a frittata which was quite tasty, but again, very oily.  Again, service was not their strong suit.  Our server actually finished his shift and left without informing us.  We need to ask the manager for our bill.  This placed opened in an area already overcrowded with Persian restaurants - most with better food and better service.  The only way place is going to survive is to differentiate themselves from all the others as the current offering ain't going to cut it.  Too bad as both the decor and the location are very good.  BTW - other review for this place had to have been posted by an employee. 5 * - common, really??"}
