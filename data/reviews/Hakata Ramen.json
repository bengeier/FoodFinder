{"text":"Not authentic ramen. Broth was ok, but that's about it. The noodles are not good and the pork are too thick and dry. Won't order the ramen again, if there's a next time."}
{"text":"The ramen was DELICIOUS!! The broth was flavorful, and so was everyone's choice of protein. Also, the bubble teas were a very refreshing treat. However, they forgot our seaweed salads (which ending up being fine since the ramen was also filling) but they would continuously forget to check in on us so we'd have to try to get their attention in a non rude way. Of course when we did finally catch their attention they were very nice."}
{"text":"I went tonight at this restaurant for the first time, the food was ok. What I really didn't like was the service was terrible, especially the waitress who served us not the young and skinny one but the older one with bangs. There are many places where the ramen and service are way more better. Wouldn't go there anymore."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ pork ramen, which was OK. There's nothing really special about the ramen here. The decor is nice, but the ambience feels a bit dead. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is on the second level and bit tricky to find. Interior and decor is excat as DAVID.D mentioned. There are only 2 servers and they doing all the work......  First table i sat had a bad smell from cleaning using a dirty cloth...so changed the seat....quantity was its enough for each. Quality wise its not that bad...But I will check other place ...its decent price....but unhappy service ppl.....food came faster....if u can get ur order....  Okay place to go with a group of friends and also for couples.....Will revisit just because the price and quality barely passes to be OK...."}
{"text":"The place looks nice, the menu extensive, the lighting was dark...  The plates are actually underwhelming. I went crazy and ordered a whole bunch of appetizers, fried tofu, gyoza, fried chicken wings and shrimp tempura. For mains we ordered one ramen and rice in a stone bowl, kind of like bibimbap.  Shrimp  tempura was good, nothing spectacular, the gyoza too, they are basically dip in the sauce stuff and if the texture or taste is off the sauce will save it, lol.  The fried tofu, was dipped in bonito flakes which I thought was a nice touch, but the sauce was so bland it tasted like water, seriously they forgot the soy sauce in that one?  The fried chicken wings was nice, good taste, texture and sauce, which I kept, hihi.   The rice came in a stone bowl and was kept warm the whole time, which is nice. I added some sauce from the chicken wings, and some hot sauce and voila, makeshift bibimbap, otherwise it was a bit bland.  The ramen was ok, really nothing special. On the whole, blah, meh."}
{"text":"Average ramen and not the greatest service.  Other ramen restaurants were closed so came here for a late dinner."}
{"text":"Good location but so so pork bbq ramen, don't waste your money if you're looking for the real Tonkotsu Ramen"}
{"text":"Sort of an \"out of sight\" spot, located on Stanley. Although they had a sign, walking up the stairs confused me at first, because it looked like we were entering someone's apartment (which I think there are, continuing up?).   This was the first time I've ever had ramen, so I can only review based on taste. I ordered the ramen with seafood, and my boyfriend ordered the ramen with breaded, fried pork chops. We also got the shrimp skewers - they were delicious! As my boyfriend would say, \"that sauce!\". I really enjoyed my ramen - the soup had this \"miso\" taste and I enjoyed all the seafood bits, nori, egg, and veggies. Super flavorful! My boyfriend liked his, but wasn't really keen on the taste - but he said he preferred pho and would probably not come back here. I would though, and to try other dishes - definitely eyeing that salmon bowl!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. I came here because I was craving something warm and soupy on a cold winter day but I definitely won't be back. I got the fish cake ramen and the soup tasted like a mixed miso/udon/chicken broth based soup. The noodles weren't chewy at all. It came with HALF an egg (cheap much?) and they threw some corn and cucumber slices in there, but aside from that and the fish cake, there wasn't much in the bowl. Actually the worst ramen I've ever had, if you can even call it ramen. Sure if you're looking for something to warm you up on a cold winter day, it'll do, but it's definitely not authentic and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"As I walked into the typical Asian student-style sit-down restaurant situated on the second floor next to Montreal's most famous strip club, I noticed the place was empty... on a saturday night: Obvious foreshadowing for an overall forgettable experience that was made worste as the evening concluded.  The decore was above average - black walls and dark tables giving off the impression of slightly more higher-end eatery than the typical asian ramen experince that seems to be cobbled up with cheap chairs and worn table clothes washed with heavy bleach.  The waiter was a shy chinese women who pleasant but less than informative when asked about the flavour of a particular oriental soda \"It's the *original* flavour\" - yes, that definitely answered my question.  I ordered the sea-food ramen, my friend had the chicken. Our plates arrived with very little delay - perhaps because we were the only ones at the restaurant at the time. The quality of the Ramen was about a 6.5/10 - Heavily salted, the noodles were in no-way cooked to perfection. The half egg was adequate but clearly was smaller than expected: In essence, the meal reflected the quality of the ingredients - simply average with noticeable cut-backs in quality.  Though in the end, I had no complaints and was satisfied with my meal, knowing that I got what I paid for... that is, if they actually let me pay for my meal, and not be forced to pay a single bill for the entire table. The service-lady could not comprehend the idea of a separate bill. She insisted it be paid together. I complained and told her I was unhappy with this business practice. Furthermore she insisted on a service charge that was not included. Being fair, I paid 10 percent of the bill - the service lady goffed and said it was not enough and that I should pay 15% - which is what prompted me to write this review.  The food may be cheap, and the waiters may be decent, but you will be nickled and dimed for low quality food..... No wonder the place was empty. I hope you enjoy obscurity for the rest of your days Hakata Ramen"}
{"text":"It's def the better ramen in Montreal that i've had so far.  But i've had better in Vancouver.  The BBQ Porc Ramen i had was good.  If the place was more like Kintaro (a true ramen shop IMO, look it up) in vancouver, i would LOVE it.  If they could somehow copy their stuff, it would be amazing.  The decor is nice.  It's a really lovely place and service was good.  I would go back, but probably not for the ramen.  They have a lot of other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Hey hey,   One of the best ramen in Montreal you can ever have. Also really good to try other Japanese dishes.  THE OMURICE !!! The ambiance is really nice. They spent a lot in the decoration to enhance customer experience.  Really good service.  I have to go back to try other dishes.  The only problem is their location. Not really good location.  Overall Great experience, must try.  Best,  Fry"}
{"text":"I went to Montreal with a couple guys from work and we stayed right around the corner from Hakata so after walking by a few times we were all craving ramen.  We all ordered the house special ramen with gyoza. The gyoza came out first but get this... 2 plates had 5 pcs of gyoza and 1 plate had 4 pcs. The waitress said that one piece dropped on the floor so there would be a dollar discounted. What!? OK... so joking my buddy said he'd give me half of one of his gyoza. He cut it with his chopstick and the meat was completely undercooked. Pink! and oozing raw meat liquid onto the plate. Gross. All the gyoza was the same but the waitress disagreed saying that only one piece was undercooked but the others were fine. Hmm... if 1 was undercooked and they were all in the same pan, cooked side by side then how is that possible. Anyway, no dice on the gyoza and the chef peaked his head out after hearing the news from the waitress and gave us the evil eye.  Out comes our ramen and without a doubt it was instant broth. We each had a few bites and decided to cut our losses and fet out of there while it was still early enough to eat elsewhere.   As we were leaving we explained to the waitress that we knew it wasn't her fault and we handed her a tip. Her response was 'thank you for the gyoza' and rubbed her stomach. She ate it!! and told us she did to prove her point that it wasn't undercooked.  I hate leaving negative reviews but I feel it's important to share this type of experience with potential customers. Undercooked pork is no joke and for an employee to respond in that manner is simply unacceptable.  On the bright side, the can of Sapporo was cold and the glasses we drank out of were clean."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday, Sunday March 24th. I really enjoyed it!   Food: I went with a group of 4 girls . We had mostly ramen dishes and one rice dish. It was quiet yummy and filling. The portion sizes seemed perfect.   Price: The price here was good! Our bills were about $13 each on average with tax and tip included. We all ordered just one main course.  Service: Our waitress was nice and pleasant. She took our orders at a good time, the meals came out within 15 minutes.   Environment: The environment of the restaurant was nice. It was dim-lit and clean. It looked neat and not overly classy. The washrooms were nice as well!  I found nothing wrong with this place, Bradley Cooper has been there!"}
{"text":"Water tasted metallic. Service was quite awkward/inattentive.   Ramen noodles were good, but broth was anaemic. Lychee smoothie tasted powdery and artificial."}
{"text":"This place is on point.  Located upstairs in a building on Peel, it doesn't warrant the tourist walk by crowd.     The ramen is delicious with lots of meat and flavorful broth.   I usually get the tender pork ramen and some sort of salad.  The short ribs are moist and tensor as well.  Service is friendly and they remember your face after a couple of visits.  It's never crowded and always a sure bet."}
{"text":"Service was good; we never had to flag them down for anything. I ordered the shrimp tempura ramen and the inari appetizer. The inari was good, a little sweeter than the inari I've had elsewhere. But they did say this on the menu! I thought the ramen broth was delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered a BBQ pork ramen and crispy chicken ramen. The food is ok but don't know why the waitress is reluctant to serve us. We didn't even get our water."}
{"text":"I am surprised at the reviews for this place.  Potentially, some issues have been addressed.  I thought this a solid execution with decent atmosphere.  The ramen i had was prepared aldente, as I like.  I had the Beef Short Ribs Ramen, which is typically quite fatty.  For those desiring leaner cuts don't get this.  The broth tasted typical yummy and the egg, seaweed, baby bok choy and corn were a solid combo.  For the price, I don't know that it's value.  There weren't an extraordinary amount of noodles which was probably a good thing as I was checking them out as an afternoon snack on my way through town.  This is conveniently located next to the Sheraton Centre-Ville and is ideal for Asians stopping through town who want something that is decently good."}
{"text":"Had the chicken Hakata style ramen soup. The chicken was delicious and the soup was very good too. The only problem was that we waited a bit too long for our order, but the food makes it worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good until all the other ramen places opened in montreal. We usually take the crispy chicken ramen. The chicken is very tender and comes in a light sauce. However, the ramen noodles are nothing special and the broth is just a light miso soup. This is not the best place to go to if youre looking for some authentic japanese ramen."}
{"text":"Le ramen est bon, le menu dîner n'est pas trop cher et offre une portion raisonnable de nourriture. L'huile épicé disponible sur les tables aide à relever le goût du bouillon."}
{"text":"This place is a hop, skip and a jump from my office, so I come here every once in a while for a bowl of ramen on my lunch break. The ramen is tasty and a welcome addition to the food wasteland that is the Golden Square Mile. However, I wouldn't bother ordering anything else here except perhaps the steamed egg, which is quite tasty. Service is very awkward... not necessarily bad, but the staff is a bit... erm... uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The food here is very tasty and the prices are affordable ($10-15 with tip for a bowl of ramen, supper time).  The decor is nice and the service is prompt.  The seaweed salad is delicious!  Disclaimer: I'm a ramen novice so for those of you looking for the \"authentic\" ramen experience, check first with some other reviews.  All I can say was that I enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Good food, nice ambience if you don't mind walking upstairs and the wait times especially around busy lunch hours during the week can be long. Once seated, service is quick and staff friendly. I love the ramen soup with tendrous beef."}
{"text":"I ate here recently on a little weekend getaway to Montreal.  I had the Hakata Style Crispy Chicken Ramen ($9.95) and my husband had the Garlic Pork Cutlet on Rice ($9.50).    So I specifically told the waitress that I did not want any sesame seeds in my meal.  Guess what?  My ramen came covered in sesame seeds and there were sesame seeds on the side salad next to the chicken (the chicken comes on a separate plate, not in the bowl with the ramen).  I told the waitress that I had asked for no sesame seeds.  She apologized and said that the kitchen must have made a mistake.  So she took my meal back to the kitchen.  In the meantime, my husband's meal came.  He waited a bit, but then was really hungry and so I told him to start without me.  He was almost finished his meal by the time they brought out mine for the second time.  So this time the ramen didn't have any sesame seeds in it, but the salad still had sesame seeds on it.  I was pretty hungry myself at this point and I didn't want to send stuff back a second time, so I just ate the ramen and chicken and gave the salad to my husband.  I told the waitress about the salad and she apologized again, but didn't do anything else about it.    Now for the food itself, I have to say it was quite good.  The ramen had a good chewy texture and the broth was quite flavourful.  The chicken was fried to perfection and was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  My husband's dish was also tasty (I had a piece of the pork cutlet while I was waiting for them to re-do my meal).  The presentation of his dish was pretty.  The rice must have been placed in a mold because it was a cool pyramid shape on the plate, next to the salad.  So when I went to pay (the waitress told me to pay at the cash register), the dude at the cash asked me if everything was ok, so I told him about the sesame seed incident and I told him that even second time around, there were still sesame seeds in the salad.  Then he had the gall to say to me that I should have told them that I didn't want sesame seeds in anything at all because they thought that I just didn't want sesame seeds in the ramen.  He said next time I should be clearer with my request.  So my mouth said \"ok\" but my brain was thinking that there wouldn't be a next time with me in this restaurant, so it doesn't really matter anyway.    It's a pity because the food was quite good.  Had they not made any mistakes or had they made an effort to make it up to me in some way for their error, I would have returned and given them a better rating.  I can't say that service sucked, because the waitress was polite and demure and refilled our water glasses several times without us having to ask.  However, I was disappointed with the way the sesame seed situation was handled by them (especially the dude's comment at the end suggesting it was my fault).  So if you have no food allergies or diet restrictions and can eat things exactly the way they appear on the menu, you will be fine.  Otherwise, I don't recommend that you eat here."}
{"text":"I don't know if my other ramen placed ruined this for me but I was not that impressed. Service is ok but not quick but I don't think that our waitress said more than 4 words to us. I had the chicken teriyaki ramen. The broth is really good, similar to one of the one I had at misoya. The noodles however ruined it for me. They did not taste good and we're hard. The chicken was ilok only."}
{"text":"There's nothing authentic about this place.  Don't go, unless you've never had ramen before.  If you've had real authentic ramen before, then stay away."}
{"text":"After talking to a bouncer at a strip club to find some food, we started to roam the streets and found a ramen spot! Naturally we were excited because we come a place where Sapporo Ramen resides. Although excited, expectations were not high (wish I never had Sapporo because any other ramen house I've tried has been sub par). Anyways upon entering the place, there was a picture of Bradley Cooper and Zoe Salanda, so we thought this place must be good if celebrities ate here. When it finally came down to the food, I ordered the tenderous rib ramen. The pork itself was very tender that fell apart by just poking at it, but the broth was very bland and the noodles were okay. The place is nicely decorated and the prices very reasonable. I'm sure there are better ramen spots in Montreal, but hey they served their purpose and gave me my quick hot soup fix."}
{"text":"Been here many many times, but only because it is at an optimal location where there is really no other Asian food around.   The food itself is worth 4 stars. The ramen is pretty flavourful. My favorite is the crispy chicken ramen. The generous portion of crispy chicken comes aside, and so you can eat them crunchy, or soak them in the soup. The sauce on the chicken was very tasty. I've also tried the sashimi, chicken and pork skewers, and mochis. Everything tasted above average, nothing was lacking in terms of richness of flavours.  However, I've learned to order nothing else but the ramen. The portions are ridicoulously small for everything else I've tried. Skewers came dishes of 3, each having 3 small pieces of meat on it... for 7.50$!?! That's 10$ including tax and tips. RI-DI-CU-LOUS. Sashimi: 4 long and thin pieces... for 6.95$!?! I got that once when I wasn't too hungry. Regretted so much. Lesson learned: take the ramen even if you're just a bit hungry. Don't venture too far in the menu, you'll probably be disappointed by the portion."}
{"text":"I liked Ichiban to get my ramen fix but they closed down. It was the only place I knew that sold ramen so i went there. But thenHakata Ramen came along.  I've been 2-3 times and it's decent but it could be better. Service is really bizarre. The third time I went, one of the waitresses was very aggressive and her tone of voice was strong, loud, and well...aggressive.  Also sometimes they don't greet you or seem happy. Anyway would go back just to eat ramen because I like it too much"}
{"text":"While in Montreal, walked around and found this place unintentionally.  You have to go upstairs, but do not go all the way up.  This place is clean and the staff is very nice.  We had the following:  - Fried Oysters - this was mediocre, oysters were small and not that great, maybe frozen..  - Japanese Beef Short Rib - short rib was well flavored and tender  - Pan Fried Japanese Gyoza - taste like your generic gyoza, nothing special  - Japanese Style Mussels - the start of the meal, super delicious and aromatic broth, light, but very satisfying  - Ramen with BBQ Pork - broth was mediocre, however, it did hit the spot, and was very satisfying after a long day on the water.  Place did not wow'd me, but was not bad."}
{"text":"Nice spot, great food, good service and not expensive  Also if you are in a hurry before your show or match at Bell Centre, it is a great place to go Ramen is delicious, I had the soft pork belly, aka number #2 if I'm not wrong My friend had another type of meal and it was also great"}
{"text":"I've only had the crispy chicken ramen & the fake crab salad, and for those two, I give four stars.  The food was good and the price was acceptable (not the best value, but compared to other places in Montreal, at least their food tasted good) Service was mediocre, but then I wasn't expecting much more anyway.  Overall, this was a good lunch spot for a quick ramen fix."}
{"text":"BBQ porc ramen was okay to good (3.5). I'm a bit new to Japanese ramen so I will have to try more  to know.  The noodles were good.  The porc wasn't a bbq taste tho but overall it was way better than my first ramen experience somewhere else.  I like the upstairs location. Good atmosphere and bit stylish place."}
{"text":"Nothing special, decent ramen, decent price, decent service."}
{"text":"My opinion might be little biased here.  As for the ramen, i was pretty disappointed. It wasn't anything special and lacked of flavour.  The service is just ok. They just came to take an order and we had to wait in line at the cash to pay.   There are better ramen places in montreal. I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"I was dining alone, so I went for the deep fried tofu with bonito flakes for the appetizer and the salmon bowl for the entree. Both where fabulous and the salad within them were both fresh and crisp. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Although the name says Hakata Ramen, it is the crispy chicken rice that truly shines in this place. The ramen soup base is so-so, the noodles too hard and the pork attempting to live up to chashu and kakuni standards and failing miserably. Don't bother with the ramen, really."}
{"text":"Ramen is not as good as I expected, but The eel and mackerel are very tasty. The fish Hamburg is good. I will go there next time and try other dishes."}
{"text":"Ok ramen but Excellent ambiance. Was in town for a conference and fully unaccustomed to the freezing weather- so we sought out hot ramen and hot sake. Not the best Japanese food I've had, but a large menu with diverse options and a scenic upstairs interior to take shelter from the cold."}
{"text":"The Ramen is not nearly as good as a typical ramen place. The broth is not flavorful and all the ramen have the same broth expect for the meat. I usually love Japanese ramen no matter what but you can go ahead pass on this one."}
{"text":"I ate Ramen and the chicken was cooked to perfection. Really delicious. Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I had the lunch special: Salmon&Salmon bowl @ hakata ramen  So it looked quite delicious. Deceivingly so.   There were just so many problems with this restaurant I *NEED* to rant on how bad it was.  1) upon entering, absolutely no-one was there to receive us. i didn't feel welcome. the waiter threw me a sketchy glance at and disregarded me while continuing back towards the kitchen. w t f.  2) finally, after getting seated, we did not receive water until 30 minutes later. hmm...  3) mayo without further addition of any condiments on my raw salmon cubes is not a \"chef's secret sauce\". flavourless.  4) warm, flavourless, sauceless rice bed sitting underneath my said raw fish. warm sashimi isn't appetizing.  i dont like to rant negativity on restaurants, but i really don't want you to waste your money and time on this place. it really was.. that bad.   the redeeming factors were the spring roll included in my meal with legit shiitake mushroom, and the freshness of the fish. but.. ruined again by the warmness.   from what i heard from the rest of the table, the ramen noodles had the texture and flavour of instant noodles.  if you crave good ramen, go to ichiban. kazu. save the trip to sketchy hakata.   I have NO Idea why the other guy even gave it 3 stars. it was SO BAD.   Ichiban ramen is wayyyy better!!"}
{"text":"Located upstairs, and free Wifi available.    The ramen was average and the service was slow.  There were 2 servers for the entire restaurant.  The shrimp tempura was good, but the shrimp was the frozen kind which I think got us all sick and running to the bathroom later that night.    This was one of our first meals after arriving to Montreal because we were starving , in need of wifi and wanted something close to our Sheraton hotel."}
{"text":"We went here because we had a voucher for it, but I wouldn't return. The texture of the noodles were a bit off and the soup was not flavourful."}
{"text":"Il y a quelques semaines, j'ai entendu parler d'Hakata sur MtlBlog. J'ai alors commandé des ramens par téléphone, pour emporter. Tout s'est bien passé, j'ai reçu ma commande rapidement, c'était bien emballé et c'était bon. Noud avons donc décidé ce soir d'y aller en couple, souper en salle. Après presque 30 minutes d'attente, on avait toujours pas pris notre commande! Alors je me suis mise à regarder aux alentours et j'ai finalement constaté que cet endroit, ou du moins cette serveuse en particulier, est une autre de ces places racistes qui servent les Asiatiques en premier avant les Caucasiens. Sérieusement?! Quelle honte que ça puisse encore se produire en 2016... Nous nous sommes carrément levés et nous sommes partis! Je ne dis pas que je n'y retournerai jamais, peut-être que c'était un évènement isolé... Mais disons que mon opinion s'est dégradée et je n'hésiterai pas à la partager!!"}
{"text":"Decent ramen place downtown. Although not authentic but good flavors.  The broth is almost the same for all ramen except the toping. Pricing is reasonable for the quality you get."}
{"text":"My soon brother in law has raved about this place again and again prior to our trip. He claimed it was the best ramen in town - before we even got on the plane he already planned to have Hakata as our dinner. I wasn't exactly thrilled - being in town for only 1.5 days, wasting a meal on ramen in Montreal? And a three stars one in some shady alley. But with the excitement in his eyes, I decided one meal wouldn't hurt.   The menu actually has a pretty extensive number of choices but we came for what my soon brother in law has been craving for. We each went with a ramen: fiancé's fried chicken, the brother's shrimp tempura and my seafood. The food didn't take long to arrive. My ramen however was already lukewarm and half of the broth was missing (the noodle has soaked it up perhaps?). The noodle was al dente just as I preferred but the shrimp had a funky not so fresh taste and the soft boiled egg was icy cold. The broth was pretty blend despite my attempt to spice it up with some Japanese red pepper powder.   My fiancé was equally unimpressed by his. The yolk in his soft boiled egg was somehow missing when served but he did receive a generous serving of fried chicken.   Although my soon brother in laws continued to express how awesome his ramen was. He did however could sense my disappointment. We pretty much ate in silence (he thinks I'm scary). Good diet/pre-poutine meal."}
{"text":"HAKATA RAMEN. It's a nice little restaurant on a second floor. The décor is pretty dark, but it works well. The service speaks French, which is rare in Asian restaurants.   I loves me some good noodle soup, I loves me some pot-stickers. What I'm not a fan of is Japanese grub, but I keep trying; because I love variety. But Japanese food puts sea based produce with pig. Don't mess with the pig man, it's the perfect meat and needs very little added to it. Then it's as if salt is unheard of as flavor enhancing seasoning, instead they use algae to flavor their grub. Nothing wrong with that for those who love sea weed, but I do not, I find revolting.   HAKATA is not very different. I order the Japanese version of pot-stickers which were awesome with the slightly sweet dipping sauce that it came with. Dumplings stuffed with steamed pork and cabbage. All for the win.  The main dish which was a pork ramen soup. This had some lows and some serious highs and then some in-the-middles. As usual these soups as a meal bowl are more than a fair portion. The noodles were ordinary and didn't taste as delicious has the handmade noodle soup I recently had at Nu Do, but they were perfectly cooked, so no real complaint here. The pork lacked a bit of flavor, was a bit flat, but was so perfectly tender that I could look past the flavor.  The low point was all that sea-weed, just overpowers everything. But the high-point and this is what saves the whole experience...  The soft-boiled egg. I don't know how they can cut the egg in two and not have the yoke run out, but in the soup is half an egg with runny yoke, sitting in the broth and it had the be the most delicious egg I've eaten... The thick creamy yoke soaking in this warm hardy broth just blew me away. That was just awesome.  All in all it's a good place for a quick lunch during work. The service is good, the food is good but lacks in the flavor department but is a really good change from all the Italian, pubs and fast food joints in the area."}
{"text":"This place was right around the corner from the Sheraton I was staying in, so I popped in for a visit. I liked the decor, like majority of the Japanese places, it's not huge but the simplicity, minimalist, and attention to detail is comforting. The food was fairly tasty, but nothing exotic or overly impressive. For entree, we got the ramen with spare ribs and chicken katsu with rice. The ribs are cut into smaller pieces and is tender and nicely seasoned, the flavor is on the heavier side but complements nicely with the lightly seasoned ramen. The katsu is slightly crunchy on the outside and tenderly cooked inside. Overall, it was a good, tasty meal, don't expect anything too authentic or dazzling though."}
{"text":"Good selection. Great pork ramen...not sure about the corn in it though. Seafood ramen is good too."}
{"text":"I have dined her once on my own at lunch hour and once with a friend at supper. I ordered the same dish: Hakata Style Crispy Chicken. It's perfect it fills the gap in my stomach! Their plum wine is nice too. They serve it with an iced glass with a cherry, it's cute! It did smell strange the last time I was there, perhaps it was temporary."}
{"text":"Ordered teriyaki chicken ramen and I gave it three stars. And the customer service is so so."}
{"text":"My friend and I both got the BBQ pork ramen and let me tell you.... it was by far the best ramen we both experienced in Montreal. Broth was to perfection and not overly salty and heavy like others. The pork was thick and tender without all that unnecessary fat stuck to it. Finished it to the last drop, literally."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Not the most authentic or delicate of ramens but perfect comfort food!"}
{"text":"The location is a bit hard to find. Food was OK, the portion was decent although it could have been a bit bigger considered the average price (around $13) and portion in comparison with other store. I had BBQ Pork Ramen, the pork was tender and juicy, broth could have been silkier but otherwise this place seems like a good option if you are looking for some quick lunch."}
{"text":"I go to Hakata Ramen fairly regularly, and I don't understand all the negativity being spewed here.  Normally I don't review on Yelp but I think this place deserves much better than the low ratings some have given it.  It has a nice atmosphere, the food is consistently of good quality, maybe not mind-blowing but still very good, and definitely good value.  I have eaten several of the ramen dishes (pork, rib, chicken), the gyoza, and the salmon-salmon bowl.  I liked all of them.  The ramen portion is very generous.  Spring rolls were pretty standard.  The waiters are quite matter-of-fact and don't pretend to be your best friend like they do in some places, which might put some people off, but I actually prefer it that way.  That said, I haven't been when it is really busy; maybe the service is not great at those times."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little spot for ramen located in the heart of downtown. It has a casual atmosphere with a decent amount of seating and reasonable prices. The inside is modern but still cozy and inviting, with big windows to get natural light while enjoying your meal. Service was very efficient and quick but not overly friendly. We came here for lunch on a rainy afternoon for some warm comforting Ramen and Hakata delivered . While it wasnt the most authentic or best ramen i've ever had, it still had good flavour and got the job done. I had the chicken ginger ramen, it was good ,the broth was tasty, the ginger really came through and the portion was pretty big also. My friend had the fried chicken ramen , but the fried chicken was a little oily and not much taste to it.. That being said, they have lots and lots of different ramen options to choose from as well as a variety of other non ramen related dishes. While this isnt necessarily my number one choice for Ramen in the city , it was still a good experience and I would be willing to go back and try more of their Ramen options or one of the other items on their menu. I definitely would encourage anyone to go and try it out for themselves."}
{"text":"Their chicken curry ramen was delicious and the portion size was generous. Price-wise, it's about 10-15% more expensive than a similar ramen in Chinatown, but what you get more at Hakata Ramen is a more spacious eating area and nicer decor. Even on a Friday night, the place is not busy nor noisy. A good place to go with a date."}
{"text":"While the ramen here tastes quite decent, I find that it lacks passion. A ramen broth should be rich, not timidly tasty. The pork slices that come with the ramen should also taste like a marriage between pork and butter, not just pork (although Hakata Ramen does nail down the tenderness factor). The noodles should also be firmer, not flimsy like 2 minute instant noodles. Fnally, the presentation is lazy. The contents of my bowl were all submerged in the broth, with no effort to show to the world which part of the ramen is boss. In short, I would probably go back to try other things, since they have a pretty creative Japanese bistro menu (like fish burger, squid skewers) and the atmosphere was very warm and fun (great as a nightout with friends). But I would take my ramen business elsewhere."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: The restaurant itself is pretty nice. Clean and simple with nice subtle hints of Asian decor. It's on the second floor of a complex so it's a little bit hidden.  FOOD: The food was ok. Nothing really stood out unfortunately. The pork chops and BBQ pork were way too dry for my taste and also very bland. The soup was decent. There are a lot more better ramen places you can go to. I don't think I will be coming back here.  PRICE: The ramen here is definitely more expensive than most ramen places in the same area but it's not break-the-bank expensive. The ramens range from 12-15$. Honestly, for the quality and quantity that you get, it's not worth it.  SERVICE: Service was good and pretty fast."}
{"text":"Bouffe - Je ne connais rien au ramen traditionnel, mais j'ai bien aimé ceux-ci. J'ai trouvé la soupe ramen teriyaki très bonne. Et si vous êtes de passage, essayez l'une de leurs boissons avec les perles de saveurs. Ces bulles au cur tendre ressemblent énormément au faux caviar d'alginate. Au contraire de « caviar » d'alginate, ceux-ci gardent leur cur liquide. Je cherche toujours à percer leur mystère. À suivre...  Service - comme dit mon amie chinoise, le service des Asiatiques sera soit vraiment médiocre, ou totalement formidable. Dans ce cas-là, le service était superbe.   Ambiance - très beau décor. Située au troisième étage, la salle réussit tant bien que mal à tirer un peu des rayonnements du soleil."}
{"text":"The ramen (crispy chicken) soupe was so so. But the crispy chickens were good. I went to the restaurant to try the ramen, and I felt disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok at best ... The menu said that the broth was made from Chicken and pork bones simmered for 10 hours ... No way ... Unless those bones were miso bones.  ZZZZZZZZZZ BORING!  Noodles were fine and the charsui  was just ok as well.  Best thing on the menu was the bubble drinks.  I must admit, those were awesome!  That is the only menu item that is giving Hakata 3 stars."}
{"text":"i ordered the Squid on a skewer, when it came out it was actually Squid balls on a skewer, so it should have been labeled that, because I would not have gotten them, squid balls taste much different than fresh squid on a skewer, very deceptive and a waste of my money. I said something to the waitress and she just ignored it. The ginger chicken ramen wasn't that great. Meat was very chunky, broth was ok but nothing spectacular. Sadly I could get better ramen else where, in which I will. Don't be fooled by the Bradley Copper photos regarding the food. I hope he has better taste when it comes to ramen, because this ramen is gross and lacks a lot!"}
{"text":"I was at this restaurant with my friend the other night and the food was very tasty. the service was incredible and the lady was very nice to guide us through the menu. I like demanding because it's got a lot of pictures and its very simple. I would definitely go back again."}
