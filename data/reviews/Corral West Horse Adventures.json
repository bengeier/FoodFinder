{"text":"We happened to drive by and decided why hike, when we can ride a horse. We went for the 2 hour tour, our guide's name was Terri Russell, he was a great guide. He educated us on the plants, stories of AZ history and also has great family stories of his own to share. He's service was great- ask for Terri however, everyone we had an encounter with had great service- just all around great folks!"}
{"text":"I went riding there for the first time in over 30 years this morning. What a great experience! I will be bringing my grand children when they come to visit me. But I'll also be back just for myself! Thank you to Cait and the guys!"}
{"text":"This place is soooooooooooo GREAT!!!!! Our tour guide, Jeannie, was very nice and energetic. The trail she took us on was beautiful. The horses were so gentle. I have ridden a horse three times and this was my first successful ride and I am so glad I came here. I highly suggest coming here, it is fun for people of all ages."}
{"text":"I've never been horseback riding but in sure glad I chose this as my first place.  From owner to working hand and tour guide (Alyssa) the experience was amazing. The people were knowledgeable and the environment was amazing.  I can't say enough about this place.  Close to phx to far enough away in the park to give you the authentic western riding experience.  Next time were doing the cookout"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  I took my 6 year old daughter for her first trail ride.  Our guide was Grady and he was super nice to my daughter.  He set her up with chaps and a helmet.  He gave clear instructions and made sure that she was safe the whole time.  We had a great ride on a beautiful day.  Grady was very personable, providing lots of information and answering all of our questions.  I would highly recommend using Corral West and we will use them again if we are back in the area and looking to ride.  Thanks for everything!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time. Went for an hour ride with Joe who was great.  Kids, aged 4 and 6 had a blast dressing up like cowboys.  Horses were well behaved and the scenery in Estrella Mountain Park was awesome. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife an I came out to ride some horses. We are not skilled riders by any means. Caitlin and Austin work at the ranch and made us feel comfortable riding. They started off with letting us get familiar eith the horse we were going to ride and went over the equipment, riding tips, and safety. My wife had a bad experience with a horse as a young girl but quickly got over her fear. The staff is very friendly and processional. The ranch was clean and the horses were well behaved."}
{"text":"My family and I were visiting Gilbert, AZ and decided to take the hour and a half horse tour. It was about an hour drive but so worth it! The scenery was beautiful and our tour guide, Jeannie, was engaging and accommodating. Definitely would return on our next visit!"}
{"text":"A perfect Sunset ride on a beautiful day! The staff was extremely knowledgeable, professional, and ensured everyone was comfortable. The trail had spectacular Arizona scenery. I recommend them for all ages and experience levels. The trail boss was great and the horses are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Amazing adventure!  Caitlin was over the top helpful and accommodating with our crazy schedule.  We were here for a soccer tournament and had goofy game times and she made sure she figured out what could work with us.   Our trail guide, Alex, was so knowledgeable of the area, the trails, and the horses.  He was funny, made us feel comfortable, and just such a great guide!   The horses are well cared for and very well loved!   I can't wait to be back in the area to come back again!  Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom for the 1.5 hour sunset ride and had so much fun! Alex was our tour guide and took us on a gorgeous trail through the Estrella Mountain desert area. Great value for the price...I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"My daughter and her friend found this option to horseback ride while we were visiting the Phoenix area.  We had a wonderful time on the 1.5 hour sunset ride.  My daughter's friend hadn't ridden before, and she had a great experience due to excellent instruction at the beginning and a well trained horse.  The girls were also very happy to hear that many of their horses are rescue animals.  We were very impressed by the reasonable price as well.  Only downside is that it was a bit of a hike from the city, especially in rush hour traffic.  But still well worth the time.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  We had an excellent time at Corral West. Our horseback trail ride was full of excellent views! You cannot beat the prices and amount of care they put into every detail. Staff is very professional and knowledgeable. I had not been on a horse in several years and my husband had never ridden a horse -this was the perfect date ride for us and next time we will bring our kids :)"}
{"text":"Horseback riding in Estrella Mountains with with family & friends outfitted by the awesome guides Cameron, Chauncey, and Alex. Excellent communication from front office on scheduling and confirmations, including timely responses to our questions and special requests. Fair value for the expense and the experience of a lifetime. We will be back again. Sincerely, Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ"}
{"text":"Hunter was awesome!!! This was our second time here with Hunter as our guide, he rocks and we love the ranch and the horses!"}
{"text":"Loved it, worth the money, we'll be doing it again. 5 stars all around. We bought the sunset trail ride, it was awesome, i would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"All the horses were beautiful. We were greeted by John and bomber  Ms. Jeanine was a gracious trail guide. We were a group of 8, I took my 9 year old son along, I was nervous at first but the horses were easy to guide. All but one horse, Molly. A young lady was struggling control Molly and Ms. Jeanine did an awesome job talking her through and ultimately getting her a new horse to continue on the trail! She was the real MVP by getting  back on the horse! Literally!  I would love to go back and try the sunset hour ride. The sunsets in Arizona are amongst the most beautiful in the world!"}
{"text":"Had the most memorable sunset ride with my family and our trail guide Jeanni.  I highly recommend the ride it was fun and the whole family had a great time  Our trail guide made it a real fun outing."}
{"text":"Today was the first time in my life that I rode a horse. Deb was amazing in getting me set up with our ride, and Cameron topped off our experience with his personality. This was a great way to start Valentines weekend with my wife. I will surely be back in the future."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to ride horses in the Estrella Regional Park.  Staff is very accommodating in arranging for groups. The horses are well maintained and easy to work with. Equipment in very good shape. Hint - Gunsmoke likes to nip the backside of horses in front of him . Our guide is excellent. Bear the 7 month old Australian Cattle dog will be your fearless leader as long as no jackrabbits distract him. Definitely recommend / our 4th tide thus year."}
{"text":"This place was great. If your looking for a place to ride houses walking pace this is the place for you. They will not allow running the horses. You follow each other in a single file line. No passing and the horses are pretty much trained to follow each other. So they are great for kids. Or for those of you who are 1st timers and are a little afraid of getting on a horse. Not to worry here at this place. Over all the people are friendly and nice. Recommendation take a couple half frozen water bottles with water inside. Or put ice in your bottles, you can take them with you on the ride. They will let you borrow a cowboy hat and boots if you want. Call for RSVP. Sunblock and glass if you have them :)"}
{"text":"Great people who gave us (3 adults plus a 6 year old) a great ride. Plus, they have our 2 year old a free pony ride around the arena! He was so thrilled not to be left out of the fun. Most places don't do that but we really appreciated it and it was a definite selling point for us. I'd go for a ride with them again next time I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a \"must have\" experience!  Everyone had a great time.  The staff (and the horses) were helpful and genuinely loved working with us.  It was a perfect girls day out.  Will return for more adventure, cowboy cookout us next!"}
{"text":"What a Way to End Mother's Day by Having the 5 children, Mom and I, headed to the trails!! Seven Riders, Priceless Experience. WOW, superb, peaceful, easy feeling from our wranglers, (should have had some Eagles music playing!) They even let the kids pick out their horses, (it was their first time out on the trails, ages ranged from 17-10.  Thank you so much for all you do guys! We'll be back next year!!"}
{"text":"Went on a very enjoyable ride with my 8 year old granddaughter on 4/8/16. This ranch is well maintained and the horses are well cared for. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"My Mom and Dad took my wife, my son, and myself to this place and we couldn't be happier! The staff was attentive to our needs, friendly and fun. I highly recommend this company to anyone trying to have an affordable and wonderful experience."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful sunset trail ride today.  All 4 adults and 2 teens (boys). I would suggest to do it on a full moon to get another extra fabulous scenery. They were not mean to Groupon customers, we were treated as regular customers. We were gonna go with spur cross in cave creek but thank the fates we decided to read the reviews, CORRAL WEST ADVENTURES has a lot of 5 stars. Cait is very nice. When i called i left a message and she got right back to me in less than 5 minutes. We definitely recommend this place, yelp only limits to 5 stars we give it a TEN."}
{"text":"We had a very memorable horseback ride with Corral West Adventures! Our guide was very friendly and knowledgeable about the AZ desert! And you can't beat their affordable prices! Thank you for an amazing experience I'll never forget!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a wonderful time!  Corral West Horse Adventures is Definately a must do.  1.5 hour horse ride through the Estrella Mountains was breathtaking.  Our horses were great and our guide Alex was amazing.  We can't wait to do this again.  I will be telling my family and friends about Corral West Horse Adventures.  We walked away wanting to do it all again :)  thank you so much for this wonderful adventure!!!"}
{"text":"Deb, Jeff and everyone here made this a very special moment. Away from the computers, games and electronics of Christmas, we made memories! Our GRANDboys were able to pick out their own hats, badges and bandanas. They supplied boots that fit each person and offered chaps as well. It completed the experience of being real. A wagon ride to a prepared campsite, roasting hotdogs and s'mores and a beautiful sunset ride back. Everything was perfect and we would HIGHLY recommend this as a family outing if you are anywhere near. We drove an hour to get there and it was worth every minute and dollar spent!"}
{"text":"My husband and I attended the Cowboy Cookout last Saturday night, and had such an amazing time.  The staff was incredibly friendly, the food was delicious, and the sing-a-long with Doc after dinner was so fun.    This evening was exactly what we needed.  The sunset was beautiful, and the entire evening was relaxed and an opportunity to get away from it all.  I highly recommend you make reservations for one of their sunset cowboy cookouts.  It's a great time either for a date night or for the entire family.  Next time my husband and I are looking forward to taking the kids.  Thank you Deb for making us feel so welcome and appreciated!"}
{"text":"We had a large family horseback riding adventure and we had such a great time! The horses were healthy looking and well behaved. The staff was friendly and dressing up in boots,chaps ,etc added to the fun! Overall great experience and would go again ."}
{"text":"Today was my daughters' and wife's first horse ride. They had the most amazing experience, the horses were well behave and the guide, Cameron, was very patient and professional.  Before my girls got on their horses, they get to pick their cowboy, or should I say cowgirl attire, boots, chaps and hat, well helmet for safety.  The guide had an instinct to match the horses with their rider, they did a good job.  Safety and guidelines were always emphasized with outmost importance. All in all this was a dream come true for my girls, will recommend this fun experience to our friends and will definitely come back for more fun in the future. Thank you guys!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with Corral West. We bought groupons for our visit. There were four of us and we all had an enjoyable time. Our guide was very friendly and informative about the horses and the land that we were on. The trail was absolutely gorgeous, and fairly quiet. The horses were all well behaved - just a bit distracted on the trail when hungry.   The check in process was very simple. They provided a clean bathroom. It did kind of suck that we had to pay parking for the regional park, but it was a small matter. I see it as a donation to our parks. Would definitely recommended this establishment!   Oh and they had cowboys hats and boots available for borrowing if wanted or needed."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had an awesome experience,  very nice ride, very nice people !! I didn't know we had such a gem hiding right here at Estrella Mountain Park in the West Valley !"}
{"text":"Very easy to book, pleasant staff, lengthened our tour at no extra fee. Horses are friendly and well trained. Ask about their s'mores package. It was a great way to end our sunset ride."}
{"text":"I cannot give them enough stars! And they should be on the front page! My daughter and I took her 2 children out there and this was the kids first time on a horse and my daughter has only been a couple of times. I grew up with horses, so I was excited to take them. We could not have picked a better place if we'd tried. We went during the week so it was just the 4 of us, which makes it so much better. My Grandkids were treated like they could do this and not even led to believe there was a choice. My 7 year old grandson, (whom I was worried he wouldn't do it,) he hopped right up there, along with his sister who is almost 5. They both did great and we had the best time! But the one thing I must stress is the service and the price. They did not charge nearly what I thought it would be and at one point we stopped to take a picture of all of us together, and I thought, \"Oh this is where they make there money?\" I couldn't have been more wrong. He lined us up and then asked who's phone we wanted to use! I was shocked and so impressed. There were so many opportunities for them to charge money and they didn't. I appreciate that so much. I told them, I just moved here and I've got 5 kids and 10 grandkids, so I'll be back for sure, but next time we'll take the 2 hour tour instead! Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Corral West and their staff are amazing! I have gone on more than 1 ride with this crew and so enjoyable every time! The trails are beautiful, the horses are so sweet, Cait and John answered any questions and always show us a good time! We ended our ride at a BBQ with a fire, music, and smores- you can't beat a night like that! I would highly recommend the sunset ride and cowboy cookout!"}
{"text":"This = AMAZING! If you're ever around this area, you MUST do this! The staff is beyond helpful and so, so sweet. The view from on top of the mountain is beautiful. We held a conference here and every body was raving about how fun it was. I didn't ride a horse, but the people that did said it was so fun! This was the highlight of our conference. Thank you, Corral West Horse Adventures!"}
{"text":"Had the best time taking the sunset ride.  The guides are amazing and the horses are so gentle.  My husband and I look forward to doing it again."}
