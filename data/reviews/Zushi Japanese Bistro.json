{"text":"As a former sushi chef & business owner, I would say that Zushi Bistro is well on it's way to earning the respect and favor of the people of Mesa.  Being only 9 months old Zushi Bistro has already acquired a fantastic staff filled with individuals of great talent & potential.    Like any new endeavor there are a few things that can naturally use improvement.  And I believe the people at Zushi Bistro can make that happen.    The sushi is good.  The atmosphere is special.  And the staff cares. Zushi Bistro in it's infancy has already achieved some wonderful and unique things.  Such as;  a spacious & relaxed patio area, a bar that inspires charm & beauty, and a sushi bar fit for the most avid sushi fan.  If you expect absolute perfection out of a brand new establishment, this may not be the place for you.  Zushi Bistro in all it's potential is young and pulsating with possibilities.  This is truly a place for the creative and open thinker.  Where there's still room for the Good People of Mesa to make Zushi Bistro THEIR place to hang out and have a good time.  I know when I go to Zushi Bistro I can leave all pretension at the door and still enjoy an evening of quality dining.   - Matt DeLeon Singer/Entrepreneur 480-621-7737"}
{"text":"It is so hard to find a good place to eat near Las Sendas.  I love Sushi, but today it was just ok.  I got the spider roll and I think it was fried in old oil.  My son got the sweet and sour chicken and I would never get that again.  Service was excellent."}
{"text":"I was surprised how the food has changed since Chris owned the place. I had a meal and ordered fried rice at a added cost instead of white rice, the rice sure wasn't fried rice. The owner still plays Peek a boo and doesn't walk around to say hello to the customers as Chris did. The food is par and the sushi is OK, but Rochelle N. wasn't eating at the restaurant when Chris owned it for the service now isn't that great, they stand around and talk instead of being alert to the customers needs."}
{"text":"They have a really lack of sense for service and propriety. I have been waiting for 45 minutes on a Sunday evening for 2 rolls and 3 nigiri, and on one of the TV screens the Walking Dead is playing.   May update based on the food, should I get it, but I will not return"}
{"text":"Do NOT eat here!!!!! We went to Zushi on Thursday 7/13 for happy hour. We've been there before and usually order the same items. Today we ordered our \"usual\" the Mesa role which doesn't include avocado and I told the waitress I was allergic to avocado and I wrote it on the sushi order sheet to be safe. When we got our rolls, I ate one and immediately realized that it had avocado in it. I started having an allergic reaction almost immediately and had to rush to the bathroom (which was filthy). After having my tongue and throat swell up we requested to speak to the \"manager\", we watched him serve 6-7 more drinks at the bar until we asked the waitress again to get him. Once he finally came over and we explained the situation, he said oh well mistakes happen, he was blatantly disrespectful, and basically laughed in my face (well THAT IS ONE DEADLY MISTAKE dealing with people's allergies). We asked for an incident report (for documentation) and he said he would go write one up then returned 15 minutes later and said he's never heard of an incident report. THEN they tried to make us pay for our meal that did not get eaten. Needless to say THE WORST food experience and customer service experience of my entire life."}
{"text":"We have had 4 dinners here in the past month or so.  All excellent in the way of service, quality of food, portions, and price.  I am surprised by any comments about poor service as that has not been our experience at all.  On our last visit we treated 2 other couples to dinner as a Christmas present.  None of them had tried Zushi's yet.  There was a pretty good variety of food between the 6 of us.  All very good, and our guests were really impressed, as we have been.  They want to go back for more!  The menu has something for everyone - you don't have to love sushi."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this sushi joint out after recently moving to the area. There was a 20 minute wait, which was fine, but the lack of seating while waiting was unfortunate. There is ample room outside to add additional seating. My wife, my 5-month old, and I stood outside for a nearly 25 mins. Despite this, we were still excited to try this restaurant. Well, the food was average, which was a huge disappointment. The worst part of our dinner was how understaffed this place was. They only had two servers for over 20 tables. They were so understaffed that they weren't seating customers outside, despite perfect weather. Nice people, but not the best restaurant experience."}
{"text":"The majority of my visits here have been mediocre at best.  Sometimes the rolls aren't great, more than once they have been completely out of premium sake, other times the wait staff is slow, and once we waited 60 minutes for 2 rolls with zero apologies (and they were far from busy).  I suppose they are the best in a 4 mile radius - but if I'm in the mood for quality, I'll choose some place else.  On the plus side, they do have happy hour specials and if the weather is nice, they have a great patio area for drinking and dining."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. Its clean and modern. Sushi is okay. It's close to home."}
{"text":"train wreck.  fifth time here, only once was good.  after giving my hungry kid's orange chicken to the wrong table, we finally get our rolls. decent enough, we've had them before.  waiter comes back to ask if we are still hungry, and is there is anything else he can order for us. YEA... how about the sashimi platter we ordered!!!?  he apologizes and 17 minutes later we finally get the 16 pc sashimi plate.. the yellowtail and bigeye tuna was disgusting.. 5 days old i would assume.   2 visits out of 5 were ok. for me, i wont spend my dollar on a 2 star restaraunt. we're done here. next.  Go to Got SUSHI if you are at this intersection."}
{"text":"Had the vegi spring rolls for an appetizer. Mongolian Beef (added mushrooms) with fried rice.  All was scrumptious!  Service was impeccable thanks to Jason.  We will be back and will recommend to all my friends.  I think this place may be the best kept secret in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Fantastic cooked entrees. The taste is out of this world as far as their dinner foods. I've tried almost all of them. A must do if you like a modern looking great tasting sushi bar that has great cooked food as well."}
{"text":"We moved to this area a little over 1 month ago and have been exploring our options. We wound up in this area and decided to try this out.  When entering the hostess lady looked incredibly bored and without a word guided us to our table, where she whispered that our server will be by shortly. About 5 minutes later the server came by and took our drink order, he came back with our drinks then disappeared for what seemed like 10-15 minutes. In that time we had been ready to order so what the heck?? And we were perhaps 1 of 5 other groups in here so it wasn't busy.  I had ordered spicy tuna and hot and sour soup. Who I was with order a steak with tempura and fried rice. One good thing about here is that if someone you're with doesn't like Asian style food then things like steak are available (this wasn't hibachi or anything, it was just a regular steak...although it was mentioned that it had a spice that couldn't be determined).  The spicy tuna roll wasn't all that great. I've been to less impressive looking places and have had amazing spicy tuna rolls for less. It was like they weren't really trying. The hot and sour soup was ok but overloaded with carrots. I tasted the steak it was decent.  It took a long time to get a refill on our drinks.  It took even longer for them to come by and hand us the check.  Have fun waiting if you go!"}
{"text":"I agree with Randi, I like this place, I've gone for the happy hour probably 7 or 8 times. I think the food is better under the new ownership and like  most restaurants some items are better than others . I've never even noticed the music in the bar except when they have had live music. The decor works fine and it is actually one of the nicer places to eat in NE Mesa. The Vegas role is very good."}
{"text":"If I lived closer, I would certainly become a regular.  Sat at the bar, Jenny is AWESOME!  All the sushi we tried were delicious!"}
{"text":"Never thought Mesa would have good sushi. It was a pleasant surprise to discover Zushi in my new neighborhood. Employees are nice, food is great, price is reasonable, and it has great ambiance. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Good sushi. Not the best vegetable fried rice but not bad either. Outdoor patio has a mist system set up if you're into that kind of thing. Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, subpar sushi. Rolls made sloppy. Sushi Kee is the spot when visiting M-Town"}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Sushi was badly made every roll fell apart. Bad service very slow got our meal wrong twice. Stick with the Chinese menu if anything at all."}
{"text":"they are a good place food is tasty they bring a little more to the party then other sushi places do if you don't like Ra."}
{"text":"Trying decide between Zushi and \"Got Sushi\" right across the street and when I saw \"No weapons allowed\" on the door of Zushi it was obvious i needed to go elsewhere.  That makes no sense in this day and age."}
{"text":"Love this place! The restaurant is under new management and it shows. Service is better than it ever was before and the sushi is fresh and unique. Tonight it was seaweed salad and chili edamame followed by the Murphy Roll, Nacho Mama Roll, and the Dragon Roll."}
{"text":"I'm with the other Yelpers on this one. We live in Far East Mesa/Las Sendas area (renting a condo--wouldn't it be great to buy right now?), and have gone to Got Sushi twice and enjoyed it. Since we hadn't been to Zushi, we thought we should at least give it a shot. Let's just say we were there for about 20 minutes with a $22.00 tab. It was painful. The people that work there are nice, but they're trapped in a land where every word that has an \"s\" in it has been replaced with a \"z.\" As in, Restroomz, Ladiez, Gentlemenz, Saladz, Soupz, Appetizerz. Should I go on? : ) The menu is outrageously long for a restaurant of its size. The food? Their spicy tuna roll--this is our test--wasn't too bad. But the maguro was very average. I would imagine the sushi at AJs might even be superior. The mackerel was passable, but that's not a good sushi bar test. As for the atmosphere, the restaurant felt more like a bar w/ side restaurant, with techno-lite muzak throbbing in the background, just loud enough to be irritating. But looking at the crowd, I don't think we're their target audience. Dads with young daughters and 2nd marriage trophy wives, young teens, all of which--I'm guessing here--don't know that much about sushi or Japanese food...now they, they looked like they were having a good time. If you know even a little bit about sushi and traditional Japanese food save yourself the time and money and head right to Got Sushi. When we got to Got Sushi, it was a relief. Oh, and we got served sake in really fun sake glasses that reveal less than clothed bodies at the bottom. Boisterous and good--I owe Got Sushi a great review now."}
{"text":"Horrible Service. Beyond Horrible food! I went here for lunch with my Dad today since he was vising from out of town. I was going to take him to Got Sushi (which is great P.S.) across the street, but I had never tried Zushi and it looks so pretty from the outside so I decided to give it a whirl. Huge mistake on my part!   We stood in the lobby for at least 10 minutes before even being acknowledged, and it wasn't like they were busy (in fact they were quite slow for lunch hour...which I should have taken as a hint). Anyway, when we finally got our seats, we didn't even get to place our drink orders until 20 minutes later! When the food finally did come another half hour later, (we ordered the Rainbow Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Eel Roll, and Albacore Nigiri) it was sloppy, not fresh, avocado was brown, the whole meal was just generally unpleasant.   I don't recommend....will never go back. I am very sorry that I missed out on a great sushi lunch that I could have had at Got Sushi across the street. That was $24 and 1.5 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back. Sad."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always order from the Chinese menu and it is outstanding! Egg rolls and their house salad is a must have. We always receive excellent service. Thank you Zushi!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, atmosphere is fun, servers are fun and happy hour specials are always good."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and loved the food! The service was very slow( but servers were nice). Favorite was the Arizona roll. I sat on patio both times and brought my 2 toddlers! Definitely sit outside with little ones! They loved it. Theres some big cushioned chairs out there too. The also had a kids menu(hard to find at a sushi place)that included cheeseburgers and chicken fingers and was pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I'm not a real big fan of Sushi but I asked for grilled Salmon Chicks and they made them for me even though they are not on the menu,That's service! Full bar, good service, and well.... My family loves this place :)"}
{"text":"I would have given it 2 stars as the atmosphere is cool with a decent patio, but there are just too big of problems to overlook!  Went for dinner with friends saturday night and came back to try again today for lunch.  Can say I have not had worse service.  At night most of the drinks at the table had to be remade as they were horrible and when I switched to draft beer (the tap was MAYBE 10 ft from me) it took 10 minutes to be served.  This place was not that busy (big shocker).  Food came out in stages so no one at at the same time, and glasses of water seemed to have to be pulled from a well far away as they took forever.  Checkout took 10 minutes.  Food was decent and decently priced so I figured worth a second trip.  Such at lunch.  2 of us sat and ordered.  only 2 other tables in the place.  I ordered 2 rolls and my friend ordered the lunch teriyake plate.  $1.75 extra for soy paper!  Really?  This is Mesa...I pay less in Scottsdale!!!  Ginger salad was horrible, straight iceberg and dressing...mek.  my rolls came out and after askign many times the teriyake came out about 8-10 mintues after.  Are you kidding me??  the tempura on the platter was doughy on the inside, not cooked, but the food was decent otherwise.  Just a shame they have no idea how to handle service.  I even told the lady (think owner) who was serving us that this was my second time and the service has been horrible, but they did nothing, didn't even say sorry.  No idea how this place stays open, other than location.  I won't be back unless forces to have a drink with friends there."}
{"text":"Tonight tried the most AMAZING ROLL! Everyone try the Murphy here it's to die for! Yet again we had the best service, huge portions and are leaving completely happy! See ya next week zushi!"}
{"text":"We went to Zushi this evening (Saturday 5pm) and I was a little worried about the reviews on the service.  We were met at the door and immediately taken to our table (given a choice where we wanted to sit).  Our waitress immediately came by and got our drink order and returned promptly with it.  The rest of dinner was the same, excellent service.  We had our young son there who doesn't eat sushi or anything foreign looking.  There is a children's menu of burgers and chicken.  We ended up getting him the shrimp tempura off the appetizer menu and told him it was chicken.  Our waitress said she would take the tails off since that would be a dead giveaway.  He was given a little plastic doohickey that made it easier for him to use his chopsticks.  My husband and I had a couple of rolls,edamame, nigiri and sashimi.  We were served complementary miso soup which was delicious.  I normally think it tastes like water but this was delicious.  All of our food was very good (we regularly go out for sushi and our regular place knows my husband by name).  All around the food, service and decor was excellent.  We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I went yesterday with my friend for my birthday. We ordered teppanyaki. Food are so delicious and chef Johnny's service are amazing. He has a lot of experience so can make fun and foods are very tasty. I never ever taste teppanyaki before. The place is clean, neat and big. Also you can enjoy teppanysushi , sushi and sports bar."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. We had the veggie tempura, the macho nacho roll, tuna sashimi, sweet shrimp nigiri, the Dragon roll, and the viva Vegas roll. It was fantastic. Service was a bit slow for us, but nothing that was a hindrance to our experience.  At the recommendation of our waiter, we skipped dessert. It's apparently subpar.   This has definitely become my new go to sushi place and it will be yours too."}
{"text":"The BEST Sushi in town by far. All others hail in comparison. Head chef Kim is and the staff is very personable. The sushi itself is unbelievable. Best place in town, i've eaten at many sushi places."}
{"text":"Awesome food, just like Flo's, I'm so stuffed right now, will definitely be visiting this place again! The Mongolian beef was fantastic, and the servers were very friendly and it's nice inside."}
{"text":"Hands down best sushi/Chinese restaurant I've been to. I would recommend it to anyone who wants quality food at a resonable price. Staff is always nice and engaging. Wish there were more Zushi spots in the valley."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service and succulent sushi.  The Arizona and Las Vegas rolls are fantastic!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Zushi for a number of years and love it. We loved being able to order take out. Recently they have been taking their phone off the hook especially on busy Friday or holiday nights. I understand being busy but if you are offering a take out service you should honor it. With many restaurants offering mobile ordering this is not acceptable.  2/26 Update: we tried to order take out again this evening thinking it would be a slower night. I did get through and was asked to be on hold. I waited for over 7min and was disconnected. When I tried to call back the line was turned off.  We loved Zushi for a number of years, but this is a joke. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love the Singapore Noodles, it is now my favorite!  My wife had sushi, it was fresh and generous portions.  We sat at the bar and watched the Orioles stomp the Red Sox,  The bartenders/server (Jennifer and Aurora) were refined and nice.  What a great way to spend an afternoon!"}
{"text":"For a north east Mesa sushi restaurant this place is pretty good... and it may not be THE BEST, but the food is good, a variety of sushi and chinese selection, the place is clean, the patio rocks- perfect for day drinking since it is in the shade.  The staff has turned over recently so they are still finding their stride, but they are all very nice...don't go if you are in a rush, just enjoy their expansive bar selection and martinis and generous happy hour (ALL DAY SUNDAY, yes!!!)  Korean ribs are good, the sushi rolls are big!"}
{"text":"I come to this place quite often; the food is good and the place has potential.    I am giving them 3-stars because their service SUCKS! I always get the same waitress and I am not sure if she is the owner and doesn't have people skills or she simply hates her job... like I said, food is good but the service might be driving people away."}
{"text":"We always come here for sushi. Consistantly good food and nice atmosphere. I asked for extra ginger once and the server must have remembered because they asked if i wanted extra agai . How the heck idk. But it was nice.haha.super powers from all the mesa rolls."}
{"text":"Wish, The Info. Here Was Up To Date!  - Just Called And Just Too Let You Know They Do NOT Deliver... This Place Look Great But It's A Little Misleading, And I Don't Know How Exactly I Would Rate The Customer Service Here!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since it's been open here and there. The sushi is really good and they have a very large variety. I don't like their customer service. They are always really slow and not very friendly.  A little pricey, but have happy hour a lot."}
{"text":"My first review.  I enjoy this place very much! Great Sushi selection, and my favorite is the Tuna Poke! All the specialty rolls are awesome.  We are always greeted and taken care of.  We've made this a regular spot, and the staff is always really nice.  I highly recommend sitting at the bar.  It's a very relaxing and awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 1115am for lunch. 3 other tables seated. I requested the bar since I was dining alone. A waitress who was not much for talking asked for my drink order. I was ready to order when she returned, but she sat the drink down and began to walk away. She stopped and accepted my order. Shrimp lo mien binto box and miso soup. The food came out in a timely manner. The soup was good and the bento box, while not traditional, was good as well. There seemed to be rice missing from my dish, but when I received the bill I realized they subbed the soup for the rice. As I was eating, the waitress came over 2x. The 1st to ask how was it, the 2nd she asked me \"are you done?\". It was a bit ... Awkward. The service here is a stark contrast from other places I frequent. There is no smiling. No friendly demeanor.  Overall my visit was fine. There nothing wonderful about it but nothing awful. The service was lackluster, but nothing that upset me."}
{"text":"First of all, I think it's really unfortunate that all of Zushi's most recent reviews have been filtered. From what I can tell, it has undergone a change in management. We just started visiting the place late in 2011 and have only had positive experiences. It is too bad that Yelp visitors can't read all of the reviews and decide how to interpret the authenticity of the reviews for themselves.  The service is excellent and the wait staff, particularly the weekday afternoon waitress, remember regulars' names and faces. The portions are large and I like to think that is a very good thing, especially when it comes to sashimi and nigiri...screw delicate tiny portions...I want fish! The fish is generally very fresh though we've probably had portions that were a little fishy a few times.  We go to Zushi almost once a week now and have never had a significant negative experience that sticks out in my mind. I felt obligated to review the place since we are regulars (and I know there are plenty of other regulars out there who are remaining silent! maybe you guys only go to the place because it's cheap?)."}
{"text":"After moving to Mesa from Los Angeles last year, my husband and I were skeptical about trying sushi in Arizona. Sushi happens to be one of our favorite foods and once we find great sushi we are very loyal. We heard about zushi from a client of mine who happens to be an employee there. Wow...was she right! The sashimi, sushi, hot and sour soup and edamame were nothing short of amazing. The staff is wonderful, especially Lynlee at the bar! We have since been back and will be going back on a regular basis. Do yourself a favor and try Zushi. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"So i gave the place 4 stars because i see that the effort is there, even if a little misguided. I am from LA and was in town visiting some friends when we decided to stop in at zushi. We walked in and were immediately greeted and sat by abby who also turned out to be our server. Abby was friendly and for the most part knew all the sushi rolls descriptions and made a bunch of great recommendations.  The food was tasty and were it not for the fact that i live so far i would go back again. However, i serve in a michellen star restaurant out in LA so i do need to point out a few things that  i noticed were a little off. As a server there are certain table cues and signs that you should look for. If your table is in the middle of a discussion its better to walk by and be present if there are any needs, but interrupting the conversation  every-time approaching the table just makes it awkward and unnatural. Then there is the up selling........ Abby is amazing, as a manager i would be really impressed with her ability to make the up-sell, but from the perspective of a customer is was too overwhelming. Toning it down, and using a little more finesse and using subtle suggestions would be less invasive. After a while all the up selling makes me feel like i am at a used car dealership. There is a good saying, \" i don't mind being ripped off as long as i feel good about it after.\" - do the up sell but make me enjoy the experience rather than feeling fleeced."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We went for mother's day for dinner. The service was good, and the food was very delicious!  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great sushi especially the tuna poke and the yellowtail with jalapeño. Jason and Lynnlee behind the bar are fantastic. Great local place to hang out and eat and drink."}
{"text":"Food was delish and the service was great! Irene, our server, was wonderful and accommodating. This has become our Friday night dinner and drinks spot."}
{"text":"Sushi is AMAZING... but service was OKAY. Our server was very nice but was very slooooow on service. I had ordered octopus and it was very dry and tough seemed old. I let the server know it was dry and he said he would take it off our bill. Then when he gave us our bill he let us know that the \"computer\" only allowed him to take $3.00 off -__- I do enjoy coming here just won't get the octopus and hope for better service."}
{"text":"Better than average sushi but what really separates this place from others is the customer service which is excellent. We go usually on Fridays after work. Not bad in price either, great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Hot and sour soup was sooo flavorful. Carbs pops were light and creamy. The sushi rolls we had Vegas and hurricane were top notch! And the prices for lunch make for a good deal!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the East Valley! The food is so tasty and fresh, my son and I love it! Their jalapeño poppers are amazing and the lunch specials can't be beat. The service is quick and delivered with a friendly greeting always. Try this restaurant and you will not be disappointed! Best sushi I've tried in Arizona!"}
{"text":"First of all, let me say - THIS PLACE IS GROSS!  I was SHOCKED when I went here to meet my friends Matt and Rob.  I sat down at the sushi bar and was not assisted for 8 minutes!!  So, finally I went to the regular bar and received a SCOWL from the sushi waitress for leaving my post.  I was so angry that the first thing I said was \"I NEED A DRINK\" to the bartender.  He was not amused.  Of course, he forgot my drink and then I was suddenly presented with some cold edemame.  It was ok.  I then ordered some spicy tuna handrolls.  They were served to me and once I saw what was set down in front me, I said \"is this an appetizer??\"  The server said \"No, that's the MEAL\"  It took me three seconds to eat both rolls.  I know I am being harsh but the far east vally needs to take some lessons from Mr. Sushi over on Northern.  They are trying too heard to be Ra and \"trendy\".  The far east valley needs something.  This could have been it.  However, THEY BLEW IT WITH ME.  Sure, I will give them a 2nd chance, but I will be on my guard!!  :)"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negative reviews.  I brought my in-laws there who are Japanese and grew up in Japan and they loved it!  The sushi chef has a very authentic style (not often found in Mesa) and uses ingredients that are truly high quality.  Most of this info was explained to me by my father in-law after a lengthy discussion (in Japanese) with the chef.  My guess is those who are crying about the rolls not being tight enough don't know a thing about real sushi and are just going there because going out to Sushi is \"in style\"."}
{"text":"We have been going to zushi about once a week for the last several years but lately the service has been horrible the last few times we have been there. We brought friends who were celebrating their engagement We ordered after sitting 25 minutes and the waitress missed 3 items we ordered. She brought the squid salad after we reminded her and we already had our dinners. I was never offered anything to drink after I finished my first and then we waited more that 30 mins for our bill. The people are the table next to us had a different waitress, they were celebrating a birthday and were seated before us. They waited more than a half hour before a waitress showed up and then she had major attitude. It took forever for their food, it was partially cooked and they also didn't receive part of their order AND resorted to go to the bar because their drinks never came...  looks like we need to find a new sushi place... they are so into trying to get more business for their teppan tables they are forgetting their long time customers and hiring wait staff that sucks.."}
{"text":"Good food... horrible service. Once we got our food they totally forgot we were here. Not sure we will be back even if the food is good."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to go to Benihana but this place is much closer to us. She had the beef yakisoba and I had the scallops and fried rice. Both came with a soup and salad. I thought all the food was much more flavorful then Benihana. I was surprised the place was so empty at lunch time. I want to go back to try the sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding. Teppanyaki chef was on \"fire\". Spicy tuna roll real good. Kids had a blast. Service and wait time was perfect. This is a great spot in NE Mesa for family and supporting local dining! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Creme brûlée was frozen, but our waiter Shawn was awesome! He really made it an experience!!! Great sushi and wonton soup to die for... Always go back. ;0)"}
{"text":"I will never go back to this establishment. The service was so slow. We waited an hour and a half just to get our sushi rolls. While tables that came in a good 30 min after us got their rolls. Plus we ordered a bottle of wine off the menu and then when we got our bill the wine was double the cost of what it was on the menu. This place is very poorly managed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Great for lunch and dinner. Amazing food and service.. I recently moved from Oregon and this has quickly become my go to restaurant. I highly recommend stopping in if you haven't been before."}
{"text":"I will start out by saying that I haven't yet had an opportunity to sit at the bar or had drinks mixed for me. I have always had a booth close to the door. I only mention this because I have never had bad service, but I usually go in the middle of the day and there seems to be less of a crowd around these times.         There is a patio to eat outside if you want to enjoy the weather, and it is actually pretty good looking. Inside the atmosphere is good as well. Half the restaurant is similar to a sports bar feel, while the other half is a more common setup for a sushi restaurant. Also, the outside of the building is inviting and is in a clean area with a lot of nicely groomed properties surrounding it.      The food itself is not honestly the best. I also have only had the sushi, but I found it to be similar to one of those restaurants that just \"kind-of\" serves it on the menu. The seaweed was chewy and the rice wasn't quite right. The fish was ok and I didn't find it to be out of the ordinary.      This is a great place for groups, especially outside or in the bar area. However I would highly recommend this place for a \"FIRST\" date. The setting is great and the food is good enough with a good bit of options besides sushi. Along those lines it's a little expensive (illusion of high quality), but won't empty your wallet. Your date will think you took her to one of the better sushi places in town."}
{"text":"Was super good, went for happy hour and ate three rolls under $20! And the rolls were extremely good, the murphy roll was my favorite, I also had the salmon roll and the vegas rolls, the vegas roll was a little different that Im use to but it was still really good"}
{"text":"I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews on this site.  I love Zushi!  In fact, it's our local go-to sushi spot.  True, ownership has changed hands, and I think they may have had a bit of a rocky transition period, but the food has been consistently good every time I've gone there.  The last time I went was a few nights ago for a pre-birthday dinner with my boyfriend.  We were not disappointed.  The decor is very cute, and they have a nice patio area with live music on weekends.  The wait staff are very friendly and attentive, if a bit inexperienced.  I love the creative sushi rolls here... my favorite is the Murphy.  Cream cheese, tempura shrimp, and melted cheese on top = pure heaven!  My boyfriend likes the Nacho Mama, which is a little spicy for me, but still very good.  Their appetizers are also excellent.  I love their coconut shrimp, which comes with a delicious dipping sauce.  Their sake-tinis are awesome (strong but yummy!), and I usually order a Purple Haze.    If you're looking for a local sushi spot in East Mesa, I recommend giving Zushi a try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place of all time. The portions are huge and the food is so tasty and reasonably priced. I like how they have a bar too within the restaurant. Nacho mama, Vegas roll, and orange chicken are a must"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been there 3 times. The food has been good every time. She had  a Vegas roll and a rainbow roll. They were very good. I had the nacho roll and a Philadelphia roll. The nacho roll is fried, not my thing, but pretty good. The Philadelphia roll was probably the best I have ever had. They put the salmon on top, instead of inside. Great flavor!   The only negative is how long it takes to get food. If you are there to hang out and eat, it's no big deal. If you are in a hurry, you may have some issues."}
{"text":"This is my third or fourth time coming to this place.  Why three or four times with the one star?  Because I keep hoping that this place is good!  It's in  such a great (convenient) location and there aren't too many great neighborhood sushi joints in Mesa.  The quality of the food is very disappointing.  We ordered a salmon roll and the \"salmon\" was a jelly consistency.  If this establishment wants to stay in business, they need to reevaluate the quality of its ingredients.  True sushi lovers know that it's all in the freshness of your ingredients."}
{"text":"I went here recently for lunch. I had the Kung Pao chicken bento box. It was horrible! The dish itself had maybe 6 pieces of chicken, and the rest of it was all vegetables. Taste wasn't good either. Eggroll wasn't very hot. I have had this dish a few times before and have been very happy with it- but not so much now. New cook? New owner? I don't know, but I was disappointed. Service was fine. Also, I noticed an increase in prices of the lunches and it definately was not worth it."}
{"text":"I have had better. The sashimi has much to be desired. Huge pieces that you can not even cut in half. When you are eating the tuna it is like eating a rubber tire. They need to rethink their sashimi. The rainbow roll was par the others are about a 3 star. The Sapporo was the best ever."}
{"text":"I'm a local to Sushi Kee so my wife and I decided to try Zushi since it's the same owner. The rolls are similar to Sushi Kee but more expensive. I would also say the rolls aren't as good as Sushi Kee. It's definitely more of a bar feel that's focused on drinks, and not Sushi."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Been here a few times now and haven't been disappointed yet. Great food. Great friendly service and I love the softer side of the music and the spread to sit."}
{"text":"I have visited here three times and the sushi is always fresh and consistently tasty. On par with some of the high end SoCal sushi restaurants that I have visited.  Best of all two people can eat well for under $50.00 Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Most of the bad ratings on here were before the management change. I never went before the change, and I've never gone at night. And it sounds like most people go at dinner. Go at lunch. They have happy hour pricing all day during the summer, and it's never busy. I am a regular during the lunch time hours. Service isn't that fast, but that's shouldn't be the mentality when it comes to Japanese restaurants. But i never wait too long. The waitress for the lunch hour is awesome, and she knows us by name.  This definitely isn't traditional sushi, but is still good. Everything I've had there, I've loved. They have good quality fish, and I've never had a problem with any of their rolls. And when it comes to rolls, I would recommend their Las Vegas (best vegas I've ever had,  and not to be confused with the Viva Vegas), the Red Mountain (It may be expensive, but it's seriously huge, where you would not need to order anything else), the Murphy, and the Spider. They have a very sweet eel sauce, much different than other ones I've had. Also try the vegetable tempura if you have a chance. this is the only place I've had tempura asparagus, and it is amazing!  For those of you who went at night, please try going at lunch, and with a little more patience! If you are looking to get in and out the door sushi, go to Fry's and buy yourself a fresh made roll there.   If you look on Urban Spoon, they have a 90% on there, so obviously they can't be that bad. :)     (Though I suppose I do have to keep in mind most people don't write reviews unless they have experienced a problem, so obviously most of the satisfied people won't write anything.)"}
{"text":"Very fresh, service was just fine. Saturday evening at 6:00 and the place was busy. Everyone was friendly and the food was awesome. No more RA for me. This place has better sushi, large pieces of fish and pretty good prices. Left very satisfied for about $25 less than I would have spent at other places. My new favorite sushi place . I'm going g to check out happy hour soon."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I always go here for dinner due to lack of other options in Northeast Mesa. I must say the service is great with Jason the bar, and Shawn, the owner is a very nice guy. It's very affordable for a Sushi restaurant, and good food. If you are ever up in this part of town, I would highly recommend going."}
{"text":"Local  hang out spot  great  food   If  it's  to your  liking   Talk to the  owner Shawn  and he  make it  right  it's  that  easy     On Jan  21st  a great  local band  Rick  and  Willie   Will be  playing     Stop  by  give it  a  shot   U  will love  it"}
{"text":"The Mackerel was fresh.  That's it. My only real compliment.  Mackerel is actually a tricky one. It can be dry, over marinated, oily, or even somewhat shredded if it's not exactly prepared. But for a less inexpensive choice, it's been one of my favorites used to determine an establishment's ability to serve quality sushi. This was up there with some of the better locations... until... the sushi chef put a mess of what I thought was minced garlic on top of each piece. Unfortunately for both of us, it was not garlic. It was ginger.  Why on earth would you obliterate the wonderfully marinated flavor of Mackerel with what I equate to Mother Nature's Lemon Pledge? (I HATE ginger). Fortunately, my server switched out my frozen beer with a less frigid relative and I was able to wash out the remnants of the furniture polish condiment before too much damage had been done.   Moving on to the Tabiko.   Again, this was fresh, but it was prepared with the finesse of a Taco Bell cashier... smashed and poorly wrapped and then thrown onto a plate. Most locations will ask if you'd like the quail egg atop the tabiko... but here, each egg will run you an extra charge. The only bright spot was that the chef offered me a ramekin of Ponzu sauce that was a nice touch over the standard soy sauce, low sodium or otherwise.   Finally, the Olive You roll. This was a \"unique\" choice as it contained ingredients I had not yet seen on a sushi menu, including an olive tapenade, sun dried tomatoes, cream cheese, and toasted garlic. It was the toasted garlic that sold me as I actually HAD that on a fantastic Albacore Tuna item at Sushi Creek in Queen Creek. Unfortunately, the chef here either forgot the garlic, or did not put enough of it in to be distinguished from the briny olives. I only ate 3 of the 8 pieces.   I know, I know. \"First review I've seen from this guy and he blasts a local place to pieces.\" Well... I can only say, try it for yourself. I hope I'm the exception to the rest of the crowd as I would love to see East Mesa develop into a culinary destination. Unfortunately, the hype, the loud music, the lack of ambience, and the poor customer service completely undermine what was only mediocre sushi to begin with.   If the owners or management read this, I would only suggest that this be seen as positive criticism. The staff needs direction and training... the food quality (freshness) is there, it just needs refining and possibly a little trimming... more is not better. Ask your customers to fill out those little surveys... find out what you can improve on to fill the place on a Friday night while still serving a quality product and giving your customers an experience rather than just some rice and fish.  * Clean up your menu, too many items and its not presented to the customer in a neat manner. Mine literally fell apart and had food remnants from previous guests.  * Train the sushi chefs and servers the finer points of customer service. Your establishment exudes luxury, but the servers think they are working at Oregano's. Far too casual and not very knowledgeable about the products or even their surroundings.  * The high ceilings draw the customer's eye upwards... unfortunately, there is nothing up there but the air vents. Paint them black so they are no longer the draw... hang some tapestries or photos on fabric. This will provide some desperately needed art while also assisting in reducing the din of the ambient chatter echoed off the concrete floors.   * Your clientele is NOT the Scottsdale crowd. These are older adults with some money, taste, and expectations. Play on that. Adjust the music to a tolerable level while still playing modern artists. Unusual tracks, acoustic versions of popular hits and live music will also bring in a niche unsatisfied in the East Valley. The younger crowd likes this for dates too... and keeps them from doing sake bombers.   * Hang some artwork on those big, tall, green walls. This place is screaming for some big black and whites of the beautiful Superstitions. What better way to acknowledge the area?! OH, and lose the piece of @%*(& hanging in the Men's room. That wouldn't have even worked in the 80's. BLECH!  I wish the proprietors luck... but in the mean time, I'll be at Sakana or Sushi Creek. They may not have the glitz and glam, but the food is fantastic, the service is stellar and appropriate to their approach and decor, and I can be sure of quality over quantity every time.

{"text":"Fresh sushi with lots to choose from. Service was great! Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Stay clear of this place! My husband and I had a date night w no kids so we figured we would go have a nice dinner, relax w couple of drinks and some sushi. I had checked there hours on there website before going and this was a Saturday so hours showed open till 11pm but bar open until 12am and happy hour until close. We got there about 8:45. We sat down and the manager/bartender started turning all the neon signs on Windows off. I looked again at hours and it showed 11pm. We ordered a drink and the waiter brought our drinks and said the kitchen will be closing soon so you need to put your order in. So we did and it was out in less then 5 minutes and was horrible! There was also 2 guys sitting at the bar and about this time the bartender called last call.. So it's about 9:15 by this time. Both men at the bar made comments about not closing time yet as well. So when the waiter came back I asked him why there hours show one thing and we are being rushed to get out of there by 9:30. He said I'm not sure I was just told kitchen was closing early. So he asked if I wanted to speak to manager and I said yes. He was the bartender and he came over and I asked why there hours on website say 11pm but we are being rushed out really early! He said oh the menu isn't even right on our website. Really?! This is how you run your business.. Bad bad customer service! I explained that we felt very rushed and it's not very often we get a date night wo kids. He didn't seem to care one bit and brought us and coupon for next visit. We left coupon. We will not be back! We were not looking to get a coupon but just better customer service. I guess that explains why it was dead in there. I have had many people since that visit tell me oh ya we won't ever go back there it's horrible and that they had bad experience as well.. When we left I looked at there hours posted on window as well and they were same as website! Bad bad customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this place because they serve quality stuff! They also have bento boxes and a wide variety of traditional and custom rolls that they have developed for themselves."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out for its convenience, despite the generally poor reviews.  I figured the clientele here probably doesn't know anything about sushi, so they might just be wrong.  I ordered the tiger eye, the baked dynamite, the oysters, the \"snow white\" yellowtail sashimi, and amaebi, salmon roe, whitefish, and mackerel sushi.  Soon after ordering, the waiter informed me they were out of salmon roe.  No biggie.  He also said they used to carry quail egg, but nobody ordered it.  Congratulations, Mesa, even Ra manages to carry quail egg.  You are a failure of a city.  The oysters came out first.  These oysters were BIG, and they were topped with what appeared to be pickled ginger, a little bit of ponzu, and maybe some cocktail sauce or something.  These oysters were actually very good; they were probably the best part of the meal.  Next I had the sashimi and sushi.  What they called \"snow white\" yellowtail was really just a standard cut at a decent sushi restaurant.  Their standard yellowtail is from the leanest part of the fish.  This sashimi was really pretty decent.  The sushi, on the other hand, was a little odd.  The whitefish (they didn't specify which species it was) was cut in a long, thin strip about three inches long, which made it difficult to pick up with my fingers.  The mackerel tasted overly fishy; some fishiness is expected with mackerel, but this was a bit much.  It was like pure brine.  The waiter informed me that the kitchen was too busy to prepare the amaebi, so I couldn't have it (how long does it take to chop a shrimp in half and fry the head?).  The baked dynamite was pretty good; it wasn't the best I've had, but the tempura crab and asparagus they served with it was pretty delightful.  The tiger eye I was not quite so impressed with; it was a bit too sweet or something, and none of the flavors really stuck out.  The idea of a crab-stuffed avocado is, however, fundamentally sound.  We finished with the tempura ice cream, which would have been pretty average, were there more options than green tea ice cream.  Zushi is not going to win any awards in the amazing sushi department.  But they are not too bad at what they are positioning themselves as: a trendy Japanese restaurant with a limited sushi offering.  Their sushi itself is not great, but they have some other reasonably good stuff on the menu.  That makes it one of the better restaurants in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been to Zushi a few times, and each time, the food was great!  Try the calamari...the first time I got it I commented on how it was the best I've ever had, and the chef told me the recipe had just changed!  Soooo good!  I appreciate the variety of rolls and other food items available.  Ambiance is perfect for a date, ladies night out or a casual business meeting.  The dimmed lights make the atmosphere more comfortable, and the music is always welcoming.  My favorite restaurant on the East Side of Mesa, and the best sushi I have had in all of Mesa.  Go after 9pm on certain nights to get the really good happy hour deals!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I've ever had. I've been to Zushi at least 3 times and love everything I had, even the ginger dressing in the salad! My husband, who is shy about sushi, got the Nacho Mama and devoured it. Excellent service and worth every penny."}
{"text":"After a long day of Black Friday shopping, my family decided to go out for dinner and we were craving sushi. Zushi is a place we had been meaning to try for a while now, since it is like 5 miles from our house. It has a nice and fancy, yet casual ambience with tables, booths, high chairs, bar seating and even outdoor seating.   It is a Coca-Cola account (which is a must as the daughter of a Coca-Cola employee) and a wide variety of wines and other alcoholic beverages.   We ordered fried calamari, cucumber salad, and wonton soup with shrimp to start; all were excellent. We then ordered 5 sushi rolls (the Sunny Beaches, Rainbow, Viva Vegas, Califonia, and Mesa Rolls). I really liked how even though we ordered 5 rolls, they all came out on the same plate instead of individual plates like some places do.   There is also a large variety of cooked Chinese food options for those in your party who maybe aren't as fond of sushi.   Overall, I really enjoyed the place and will definitely be coming by more often when I get more cravings for sushi."}
{"text":"Started eating at Zushi recently.  We had always gone to \"Got Sushi\" but decided to give Zushi a try.  Overall we felt that the quality of the food was better and the rolls also seem larger.  Now we have to decent sushi option."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout.  Missing our cucumber salad, food was poor.  I'll skip this place from now on!"}
{"text":"So good! Staff is friendly and knowledgable. Food is delicious, must try the Zushi tini"}
{"text":"Under new ownership? Great I thought....Well the same loud crappy music was blasting and the big screen TVs were playing. I actually like the inside of this place, but the loud music and big TVs don't fit. The food isn't bad, not cheap, but not bad. I just can't get over the fact that the music is to loud and not very good and the service is poor. Have you ever considered jazz and a pop alternative? The average age of the clientele looked to be over 30, no twenty somethings in sight. If the bartender tells me one more time (3 in the twenty minutes I waited) that my to go order will be right up I may have to smack her. Just kidding non violent, but jeez give me a break, I'm tired its late and I just want to go home and have dinner!"}
{"text":"Food and service are very good. Prices are reasonable especially during the lunch special. Will be coming here again."}
{"text":"This a great place for sushi. The staff is wonderful and the service is excellent. Bar atmosphere but clean."}
{"text":"Horrible service, IF you can call it service at ALL!  We arrived at noon today, a Saturday, there was only one waiter, no bartender and no one working the sushi station.  We were a party of ten and the only patrons inside,there were two tables on the patio with patrons.  They were not busy at all.  It took 20 minutes for the 'waiter' to come over to take our order.  He hadn't even brought water at this point.  We decided we would order our drinks at the same time.  The 'waiter' REFUSED to take our food order!  He said his 'helper' would be there soon and then he would take our food order.  Really?  We should have walked out then, but we were celebrating a birthday.  As we waited for our drinks to come, two men came in and sat at the bar and a family of 3 came in.  They all received their food before the waiter even came back to take our food order.  Finally, the waiter brought us water but still not our drinks and still did not take our food order.  After being there for an HOUR, the waiter finally blessed us and took our food order.  Again, we had another long wait.  About twenty minutes later the waiter brought us some free salads to 'pass the time' as he put it.  Finally, as the men at the bar were finishing their MEAL, one of our entrees came out.  A good ten minutes later 2 more came out.  By this time the family of 3 had also finished their meal and had left.  After having been there for almost 2 hours, the rest of our entrees arrived.  At this point, none of us cared what the food even tasted like!  True to form, the waiter took forever to bring our check and then over charged two items.  What should have been a fun birthday lunch turned into a 3 hour  debacle!  Even if the food was amazing, which it was not merely ordinary, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Wow.  tepannayki now is open!!!! The best sushi restaurant just kicked it up a notch. !! Make sure you check in with your yelp app and Lynlee will have a drink special for you!!!! Steak and lobster the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! I love their bento boxes and sushi roll combinations. Service is friendly and fast for a quick in and out option. I personally love the Vegas roll and prices are reasonable for the quanity. The atmosphere is on par and they play great music for a chill happy hour spot. I'd recommend this to anyone who is up for a sake bomber or two!"}
{"text":"Jason and Lynlee are awesome! I never have had such top of the line service from them. They care for every customer that comes in. Great atmosphere will go back every chance I get!"}
{"text":"A sake bomb for $6.50 can't be beat, but $3 blue moon on tap keeps me a regular here.  While the service can be spotty due to their high turnover on waitstaff... Their Chinese food will have you doing all your take out from Zushi.  If you are a stickler about good service though, you may want to request that William wait on you.   My favorite Chinese dish is by far the General Tsao's beef (I ask for shrimp in mine too, so worth it), and if you're going for sushi the best salmon roll is the Sunny Beaches.  If you can dig on eel, ask for the Power Roll: Shrimp tempura inside and eel on top. Its not on the menu anymore but they will still make it and you're cool like me, add cream cheese to it too! They are very accommodating."}
{"text":"Whats up with the Zushi hate? This place is pretty good. There's a nice bar, the sushi is good, the service? I never had a problem! My favorite things to get here are the wonton soups HUGE PORTIONS.. so yes to that. The sunny beaches roll is divine, it has tuna inside and then nice pieces of salmon/lemon on top. Super yummy and perfect for these hot arizona days/nights. The only reason why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that this place is just a little expensive... 2 sunny beaches rolls, 3 orders of nigiri and 1 philly roll.. and Im looking at a 50/60 bill. Ehh.. oh well this place is literally   1 min away driving from my boyfriend's parent's house in Mesa.. so we definitely are partial to this place due to it's convenience."}
{"text":"Not bad for sushi but not great either as this place can be really hit or miss. Some days the rolls are wrapped perfect and other days they are  looser than MC Hammer pants. The fact that the location is convenient to my girlfriends house makes this an easy stop somedays to fill a sushi craving but not destination sushi. Went the other day and the albacore and salmon sashimi was cut odd so that it was stringy but the Zushi Kee roll was very good and flavorful as was the other roll i had. Other times I have been things have been just fine. Once again they have changed ownership so hopefully things will stabilize. I will probably keep coming back when I have a craving and I am near by but if i want great sushi this is not where I am headed."}
{"text":"Great service and management. My wife loved the sushi. Surprisingly they had Pad Thai and it turned out to be excellent."}
{"text":"Absolutely unbelievable service from the same waiter every time.   In with a party of four an the dude take the lady in our party first and ignores us three of us for ten minutes   I can't believe they keep this guy that cool be cause they lost faithful customer."}
{"text":"Good, fairly priced sushi and a great menu for non fishy lovers too.  Nice sized rolls, lots of ginger and the wait person was fine, kept the drink refills coming and got us in and out to our liking.  I didn't like the 1st table and hostess moved me with a smile and no problems. Best freshest fish for the price in East Mesa."}
{"text":"Can't complain, can't rave. Typical, middle-of-the-road sushi place. Food was fresh, tasted fine. The price was.....OK. The food took a really long time. Service was good, but the waiter tends to invade one's personal space a lot. Better happy hour deals would entice me back, but as it is, I'll stick with my all-you-can-eat favorites."}
{"text":"I understand why there are some poor reviews of this place.  At times the service can be slow and clunky especially at night and especially if you have a group.  The reason I eat here often is their rainbow roll is fantastic and so it the salmon nigiri.  Service is great during the day for people who like to stop in quick for a sushi fix.  Staff always recognizes me and makes me feel welcome."}
{"text":"Best Orange Chicken Ever!!!  Zushi has an amazing lunch menu, that offers many selections to choose from. They offer happy hour prices pretty much all day! That's something that you don't see all the time.   The place is pretty quite during lunch hours. So if you're looking for some peace and quite, or looking for a good spot for a business meeting this place would be good for you. They have a pretty large bar seating area with TV's to watch sports or what not. The lounge area is quite large also which offers more of the restaurant style seating.  I came here for lunch and ordered the Bento Box with Orange Chicken. Let me just say... Probably the best... No wait correction.... THE BEST Orange Chicken I have ever had in MY LIFE!! I could not believe the sensation my taste buds were going through! The texture, flavor, smell, and spice all joined together for an amazing delicious delight! To give you a better idea , and proof that I am not over exaggerating... I came here the very next day for lunch and order the very same thing! The Bento Box also comes with a side salad, rice (you get the choice to have fried rice for an extra cost), and an egg roll with delicious tangy sweet and sour sauce. Best part of all... It's only $6.95  This place is located on the south west corner of Power Rd. and McDowell Rd. in Mesa.   The staff here are very polite and professional. I spoke with Meng, who also served me. She was very knowledgeable when it came to explaining anything I didn't understand from the menu.   I think next time I visit here I will try to order something other than the amazing Orange Chicken. It's definitely going to be a challenge! Mongolian Beef may be my next venture!"}
{"text":"Zushi is a pretty average Sushi joint. The first time I tried this place it was below average, as I'm pretty sure the ownership had just changed and service wasn't that great and the food wasn't all the impressive for the price. We did go back and had a way better experience and it was during happy hour so the prices were more reasonable. I have a few sushi place that I will always go to over Zushi but I wouldn't be opposed to coming back."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience. We waited 45 minutes and still the waitress did not come to take our order. We were not the only ones. All of the diners around us looked livid. We have never waited so long at any restaurant before and we have gone on busy days before. Every seat was not taken here so it wasn't as if they were packed to capacity. Our waitress seemed to not understand her job or something. It was an odd and infuriating experience. I can say nothing about the food because we walked out without ever getting to order. We will never go back here. Any restaurant who thinks so lowly of its customers is a red flag. Maybe some people enjoy this place but those people must have gobs of time on their hands. I would give this place zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"The happy hour....is nice and long 2 thumbs up.  We ordered 5 specialty rolls and 2 bombers and our bill was still 50$.   The worst part is that we walked away hungry.   If i spend that much I want to be full."}
{"text":"Was kept waiting for napkin even though I had been served my edamame. The dish for soy sauce was dirty and now I am waiting to tell my server it is unclean and I need a new one. Not off to a great start.  The food arrived and it was amazing. The amount of yellowtail over the rice was amazing! The biggest portion I have ever seen. The spicy tuna roll was excellent but had a bit too much rice around it. Overall a good dining experience till the check arrived...  Soda water or club soda is not free. Not impressed! Soda water is free everywhere else but not here. That was not appreciated much.  I would come back. It is close and happy hour is okay pricing"}
{"text":"For north east mesa this place is tasty!! Food was great, service was great and happy hour prices were decent. Our food was served very quickly! We had sushi, orange chicken and jalapeño poppers, the poppers were sooo good! Definitely will go back again!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times in the past and the sushi was always good. I hadn't been back in almost 2 years when we went yesterday.  I was actually kind of shocked at how badly the decor and the cleanliness of the place had gone downhill. The bathrooms were disgusting, and looks like they hadn't been cleaned in a couple of days. The tables were sticky, the floor was sticky, the silverware was dirty and so were the glasses. This place needs to be cleaned thoroughly and needs to give instructions to their staff on how to clean because this place was really gross. We almost got up and left because of that.   The waitress was very nice, but barely spoke any English. She got our order wrong, and what we ordered first as an appetizer came about the same time we had finished eating and we got our bill. Our kids meal was extremely late, and came just as we were finishing our meal. It was all messed up.  I got to say the food was pretty decent, the Las Vegas roll was good and everything we had was decent it's just not enough for me anymore. I can't go to a place that feels disgusting to sit in."}
{"text":"I like the food here.  It is as Rebecca said, not traditional and there is stuff on the menu for kids as well.  The layout is kinda fun and there is live music on the patio.  If they happen to have the peanut butter pie for dessert, GET IT.  It was heavenly!  With regard to S.A.'s review, the band that played there 4/25 was The Big Zephyr, of which I happen to be a member.  We are playing there again this coming Saturday night 6/13/09 from 7-10."}
{"text":"Disappointing... We have lived in this area for 15 years and finally decided to give Zushi a try for takeout Chinese food.   They answered the phone quickly, and efficiently took our order. Three main dishes came to $47, which I found to be somewhat pricy, but it could have been worth it if the food was excellent.  It wasn't... Everything was serviceable, yet very, very bland and lackluster. The Sesame Chicken had four pieces of broccoli in it. I'm not sure if that was just a garnish, or if we got veggie-shortchanged? The whole meal was just underwhelming. At least we'll never drive past it and wonder ever again."}
{"text":"Don't even bother ordering take out because their phone line is ALWAYS busy on the weekends--because someone in the office is on the phone and they do not care about losing your business!!!!   We've eaten at Zushi for years and their food is delicious but the customer service is terrible.  The owner could not careless.  We live very close & want to see all the neighborhood restaurants succeed.  So, for years we've put up with the sub-par service only because the food is good.  But now, I AM DONE!   We frequently order out & because the phone is consistently busy, my husband will go in and order ---even though it's very inconvenient.  Tonight when he once again questioned their phone system he was told, \"Oh, someone in the office must be on the phone and we don't have call waiting\"  . .  AGAIN!  My husband proceeded to explain that they may be missing out on some business but the owner's son could careless.  No apologies, no concern.   I've had it with their lack of interest for the customer.  I would rather drive to Val Vista & Baseline and order out from Ra."}
{"text":"Worst service/ experience I've ever had at a restaurant. Food was terrible, staff was unaccommodating, and the female manager on shift was extremely rude. On top of the horrific lack of customer service skills, the food was awful. Highly recommend staying far away from this establishment."}
{"text":"came here a year ago and it was decent. today I came back and the customer service and food quality has dramatically declined, we were the only ones in the restaurant and our waiter was very distracted and barely paid attention to us, there were flies and the floor had not been swept in quite awhile. the sushi was cheap but taste cheap as well, warm and did not seem too fresh. Probably won't come again."}
{"text":"Good sushi, especially for east mesa. Service is notoriously and consistently poor. 15min for water, 45min for any food, 5min for beer. These are standard tines, not based upon 1 visit. Sometimes you're not sure if you server completely forgot about you. Only reason we go is it is close, decent food, and really the best quality sushi near us that we've tried. Just realize the service will be bad if you go and don't expect greatness."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. I am absolutely astonished. The manager took our Togo order. I told my husband to order our dish without mushrooms because I knew they had been included in the past. She assured him there were no mushrooms on the dish. Low and behold...mushrooms. So I call and first she tells me there is a new cook who must not know. That tidbit of information did not please me. She moved onto arguing. She said she packed it up herself and knows for a fact there were no mushrooms. When I persisted and offered to send a photo, she agreed that a photo would be necessary. This person literally asked me \"why I was getting all rude with her and stuff\".  Ummm maybe because I just paid $40 for food that's wrong? Or perhaps it's because my menu knowledge of this restaurant is better than the manager's. In any case, she put me on a long hold. I assume she was speaking with the person who cooked the food because when she came back she informed me that she was wrong and there were, in fact, mushrooms in my rice and lo mein. What a joke! I'm no hospitality expert but my humble opinion is that this manager should study her menu and not be allowed to answer the phone until she's taken some courses in guest recovery."}
{"text":"We came for christmas teppanyaki.  Our server was prompt and took our drink order quickly.  The guy who worked the teppan table did a fabulous job.  He was super entertaining and made our holiday dinner fun and special.  The food was delicious and fresh.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great flavored food, quick service, gluten free soy sauce available. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and to say the service was good is a far stretch..  Decor- So they have a vibe where they want to be a chef demo/bar/sushi house. It wasn't laid out correctly, and the demo cooking area was empty. On a weekend, bennihanas and such are always PACKED. They had 1 table cooking, not the best sign. Boxes of napkins and other supplies were out in the open.  Service- Ok... We were sat by the hostess, and were told someone would be with us.. after 3 times trying to flag someone down, and waiting 15 minutes I went to the cash register and asked some one to help. The server didn't speak English well, and told us the tea was \"no good \" and that they didn't serve real chow mein.  Food- The sushi was surprisingly pretty decent, not the best, but for happy hour pricing, I was content. The spice levels were somewhat close to what they described, but if you like spicy, go all the way.   Overall- I really want them to succeed and do better. I love supporting local places, so I will go back and see if they read the reviews."}
{"text":"Update 5/18:  I really need to start trusting my intuition.  Tonight, against better judgement, we gave it another shot.  $70 wasted.  Slowwwww service, poorly made sushi & inedible sashimi.  The sports bar of Sushi joints.  The place your alcoholic uncle thinks is \"really good\".  Just all around underwhelming and borderline gross (beer battered calamari...Really?).  Took the sashimi home to the cats in hopes of salvaging our investment.  They sniffed, made a face, walked away...one of those cats once willingly ate rocks, so you know his standards are low.  Next time, we'll just go to Nando's.  First timers.  We were one of 4 tables there at the time, and sat out on the patio with one other table.  Our server left us sitting for a good 15 minutes, while the other table's heathen children ran around our table screaming, throwing paper airplanes overhead and talking to us, even after we asked them to leave us alone.  We ended up just walking out and going somewhere else because we were too hungry and annoyed to wait any longer."}
{"text":"I only came for drinks at HH so this review is NOT related to the food.   But this is a cool little spot. Far from my Scottsdale home but close to my far East Mesa office. Came with a co worker after work around 4PM & it was empty, one other couple at the bar, but people slowly started coming in. Almost EVERYTHING on the menu is on HH, its awesome, ALL sushi rolls & most drinks. The problem for me was some of the prices. Philadelphia roll, typically $5-7 elsewhere is $9.50 normal, $8.50 HH, pretttty steep to me. But I did not order sushi. Instead we each got a glass of house wine on happy hour for $5 & it was good. Bartender was very good :) I would like to come back for sushi just not pay some of those prices for basic rolls."}
{"text":"This place has has its ups and downs with service but has been getting more an more consistent over the past several months. Very nice patio for hanging with friends."}
{"text":"Zushi has had quite a few ups and downs. Unfortunately they are very hit and miss. One thing I have noticed since new ownership has taken over is that they have a few new rolls. But the rolls aren't rolled tight and the fish isn't quite cut properly. I do love the atmosphere, especially sitting outside on the comfortable seats near the fire. But its just not all that great!"}
{"text":"I was torn on what to rate this place... Tonight was a date night. We were seated right away. Drink orders taken. Then waited...they add more to our table (we are on the teppanyaki side). Then we waited some more... our actual food order was taken...more waiting. One couple almost got up and left. Right when they were about too, the soup and salad came out. It was 45mins from the time we got our drinks to when we got our soup and salad...  With that aside, the chef, was amazing! He broke the tension at the table from the wait. He was funny and personable. If we were to go back it will to request him. *Tip if you have a family member who is type 1 diabetic, test your sugar before you go in. As the wait is long to get your food and our waitress was hard to find."}
{"text":"I have always loved Zushi, they have very affordable menus all around specially the lunch menus. I got coconut shrimp with yummy ell rolls and this other dish that was not what I expected but i was pleasantly surprised. It's usually show here which is nice to come with my computer and use the WiFi. It's also very clean and the husband and wife that run it are great. I only wish they had more business for themselves.. This is a must go honestly I love it!!"}
{"text":"My family has eaten here a few times and it is pretty consistent. The sushi itself is really good, however, it's not the best I've had do that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. The service here is amazing! The waiter remembered our family and was very helpful and attentive. Nice place, a little expensive, but overall, good food and great service."}
{"text":"I like the layout of the restaurant and the patio is very nice, but the sushi leaves a lot to be desired. Some food items are decent and then there are many that just lack any flavor. The wait staff has been very slow every time I've been there. If you sit on the patio, expect to have your patience tested, or just go inside yourself to place an order."}
{"text":"Not sure that I was actually served fish. May have been pork. Or a poor pork substitute. Service was non existent. You'll get better sushi at the circle k around the corner."}
{"text":"this place was okay. Nothing great but not bad either. The prices were pretty good and I felt like we got what we paid for. The sample sashimi platter was awesome. The fish was fresh and it was fun sampling the different types. The down side was the waitress sucked and seemed pretty annoyed when I ordered a second martini. Hey, it was my date night with my man!!! She didn't know much about the menu and told us many times she was new. I wanted to tell her to take the damn menu home and study it or something. The martini I first ordered was their specialty. It was called the purple haze. It pretty much tasted like grape kool aid and sake. Gross. The second one wasn't much better but being it was my second, I didn't seem to notice :) Anyways, decent sushi but I am not in a huge hurry to go back. BUT the atmosphere was fun and pretty modern. I could see how it would be a blast to go there for a drink and appetizers while watching a game or something."}
{"text":"Their door said they were open until 11. We showed up at 9 on a Saturday night and they gave us sh!t about it.  No thanks friends."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I have had out here, the roll selection is very unique and good.  Get the Nacho mama, wow soo good, or the murphy roll, almost too decadently sweet and yet you want more.  atmosphere is cool, classy and dark, good people working here, even when this place is packed, you get good service.  cocktails are awesome too."}
{"text":"The Teppanyaki side of their business just opened and we had an AWESOME dinner tonight.  Just as good, if not better, than Benihana.  Good quality filet and shrimp.  Flavorful appetizer soup, awesome ginger dressing on the salad.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favourite spot for a happy hour in East Mesa! I highly recommend the bar. Ask for Jason."}
{"text":"Great service- Irene was our server and she had excellent recommendations that were spot-on, from beverages to the Veggie Delight! She was attentive, friendly, courteous, and engaging on a busy Friday night. Thanks Irene!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, everything tastes fresh. Happy hour prices are nice. We have never had a bad experience. The new teppanyaki grills look like fun,, we got to watch while getting sushi."}
{"text":"Great stuff for this area. Definitely the better of the sushi restaurants in Mesa and the staff is cool. The bartender Jason is rad plus the Nacho Mama roll is good, as are most of the other rolls I had. If you're looking for better sushi and a nicer, more elegant atmosphere without the douchery of a real fancy place, Zushi is perfect."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. Wife had been once before for sushi. We had teppanyaki and two sushi rolls this time. This place is awesome. The sushi was way above average. It was just as good as sushi I've eaten at Sushi Roku. Better than sushi at RA. The teppanyaki was just as good as Benihana.  People giving low scores here are crazy. This place is awesome. Lot of people saying \"Benihana has this, that, etc\",....this place is not trying to BE Benihana. Period. They are a local sushi & teppanyaki restaurant for locals. This was my first time here and this is now my favorite restaurant in Mesa. By far. We had the steak & lobster(me), and chicken & shrimp(her) teppanyaki. It was awesome. And the fried rice was great. The two sushi rolls we had were the \"Nacho Mama\" & \"Sunny Beaches\". They were awesome. Way above average quality. Truly Sushi Roku or Roka Akor quality; & I am not kidding. Can't wait to go back to this place again. Food was excellent quality. The review that rips on this place for \"Chinese takeout\"????? They either reviewed the wrong restaurant or are just totally ignorant. This place is sushi & Japanese food/teppanyaki. Not Chinese takeout. And the food is excellent. We will be regular customers. OHHH...and right now they have a special on teppanyaki. It's buy one get one half off. I was told the owner wanted to do this to introduce their new teppanyaki section of the restaurant just opened this year, to the community at reasonable prices. The quality of the teppanyaki food and the talent of the chef is not compromised at all with these temporary lower prices. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Figured it was time to update Zushi.  Last review here was 8 months ago but we've come here to eat and for carry out at least a dozen times since.  My opinion of this place hasn't changed.  It's still the best all around sushi/Asian food place I've been to here in AZ since I moved here a little over 3 years ago.  The menu is diverse so if you don't like sushi they have all your various Chinese dishes as well as some American favorites. Although I have to say they have some sushi rolls that would even appease the most skeptical sushi virgin.  I'm a sushi novice and some of the rolls I really like (Murphy roll, Las Vegas roll, and Spider roll) are probably not even considered sushi by experts; but boy are they good. Dont forget to try the egg rolls and pot stickers also.  If you want something lighter go with the bento box.  It's a smaller portion of an entree with a salad and egg roll.  I'm a ranch dressing fanatic but their ginger Asian dressing is really good and will surprise you.  Anyways, Jen and I ordered the lettuce wraps here for the first time today.  They were really good but we couldn't decide if we liked these better than PF Chang's or not.  I think it's a tie but they are distinctively different.  Jen ordered the Hurricane roll which is crab, cucumber, salmon, tuna, with avocado on top finished off with some crunchy tempura crunch on top of the roll.  I am in a slump and order the Spicy Chicken Bolgogi for about the fourth time in a row.  lunch or dinner, get the dinner portion because you will want to take some home for later.  They also have it in beef.  Very tender chicken pieces amidst slices of carrots, zuchinni, onion, celery, various peppers, mushrooms, and this amazing red sauce which they will make as spicy as you want.  Very capable of clearing your sinuses. It's amazing.  Of course we ordered their largest bowl of Hot and Sour soup to go which is the best I've ever had, ever, and is made from scratch.  If you're in the area or just having a hard time finding that one of kind really good Asian restaurant, you have to try Zushi.  DO NOT SKIP THE HOT AND SOUR SOUP. And yes, it was about 109 degrees out but the food is worth it.  It's well AC'D anyway."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area and are trying out all of the restaurants near us for the first time. We were just driving down the road and this place looked good. We are glad we stopped here! The atmosphere, service & food was great, it was very flavorful with some interesting sushi roll combos, and we shared the chicken bugogi to try something new, and we were blown away. We will definitely make this one of our regular stops!"}
{"text":"If I could leave NO stars, I would. Extremely rude server, start to finish. The rudest server I have encountered in my entire life. She raised her voice to me when I asked for an appetizer in addition to my order (as I often eat an appetizer as a main meal). It was my daughters birthday too. Three of us for lunch, upon ordering, she barked at me \"YOU ORDA !!\"  I was confused by her anger at that moment and didn't understand the tone, nor her demeanor as she was clearly frustrated and actually ANGRY with me and slammed her pad and things down on our table and sighed heavily. She was VERY SLOW and we felt it deliberate, she sure wasn't busy. Only one or two other customers in there at the time. When she would come to the table she would motion with her hands to my daughter (who was kindly stacking plates in order to assist her), to hurry up!!!  We were offered no dessert. When we asked for boxes it took forever and she was just standing there thinking she was out of sight but we were watching her do nothing. We asked her for the check, this also took a long long time, we waited for her to pick the check up, and she was still doing nothing.  once again, deliberate. My daughter, had cash and paid the $51.00 tab for lunch on HER BIRTHDAY just so we could get out of there!!! We left an undeserved tip of $3.14. I reimbursed my daughter but fully intend to visit the manager there and have my money fully refunded - and in addition, the $3.14 can come out of her check. She gets nothing, but fired (if I have anything to say about it). I have been in the food & beverage industry my entire life and have NEVER experienced such BAD service experience. Food was OK, but She left a 'bad taste\" in our mouths, and clearly has NO business dealing with the public."}
{"text":"As a person that eats Sushi regularly and has done numerous reviews on sushi restaurants I have to give this place a 3.  The main reason anyone goes to a sushi place is for the fish. The simple and unfortunate fact is that the fish was not cold and it was just mediocre. While service was very good and everything was super clean, I didn't leave feeling I got a good amount for the price.  For instance the tuna sashimi was room temperature and tasted a little metallic for $14.  We such a wide selection of sushi choices this is not a place I plan on returning."}
{"text":"Another one of my favorite spots since moving to the area. I actually have a memory of meeting a friend there for happy hour years ago and really liking it a lot. We recently went for late night happy hour and had a really great time. Whilst having one too many sake bombs, the place had a very good vibe and the bar tender was very attentive to us, not to mention the sushi was delicious. We'll definitely be back, and soon!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had a really nice time here a few Saturday's ago. Went kinda late but there was still a few people enjoying food and drinks. I see some people had issues with the service but for us it was fantastic. We actually sat at the bar and only really interacted with the bartender. I believe his name was Jason and he was great. We had no idea what to get but luckily he walked us through the menu and recommended some things that we ended up ordering and everything was very good. The fish was super fresh and the rolls were delicious (can't remember exactly what we had). The atmosphere was really cool and it's great we have a couple places like this now in north east Mesa to eat and have a couple drinks."}
{"text":"This place is great for sushi, lots of room not to cramped  and yes they have a live band , it's a good place to go for good food the right price and fun time out with friends.  The people who are  giving it 1 star are just plain stuck up. This place  is great."}
{"text":"If the food is good enough, I can easily get over bad service. The food came quickly however the waitress was a bit rude and was talking on the phone when serving me. Whatever. Let's move on to the food. unfortunately I learned the hard way that sometimes you need to listen to yelp reviews! This was by far the worst sushi I have ever eaten. I ordered the sushi lunch special with a spicy tuna handroll. Thank God for that hand roll (which was decent) because I had to force myself to even finish have the sushi. The fish smelled, felt, and tasted off. As soon as I took my first bite I could taste this very fishy old taste. Really unpleasant. I hope I don't get sick in the near future :("}
{"text":"We have been ordering takeout every weekend but finally went in for dinner. What a pleasant surprise. LOVE this place. The food is outstanding and the people are great. Definitely a new place to go for us!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi and a 3.00 kiltlifter on a Saturday!  Sushi was great and we had a Korean dish with bugodi (sp?) sauce and it was wonderful.  We just moved to the area and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I went years ago and wasn't impressed. A co-worker wanted to meet up for some sushi and picked this place - I was seriously hesitant. This place has improved SO much! Their sushi rolls  and sashimi are some of the best I have had around the valley. The service has always been great and they have a wonderful drink selection and happy hour pricing. My only request - watch out for the salt in the miso and watery salad is a bummer."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night we waited 15 mins and sat down which is not bad at all!  I loved the specialty sushi they have but sushi and service was great all-in-all!"}
{"text":"My search for good sushi is over!  It also comes with great service.   fresh, huge portions, and for half the price of those awful places we kept trying until we wound up here!  The Sushi Chef Sony  not only took great care of us, he gave my 10 year old mochi, without her ordering, How did he know she loved Mochi? we had never been here. We will be back, I can't even begin to  tell you that fresh sushi on a Tuesday before 4pm.  was on my mind,  I walked in saying \"I am hoping for the best ,but expecting the worst! AMEN! I am not crazy good sushi good portions and good service do exist. right here in Mesa! Thanks Sony, and Song. We are happy campers, and look forward to seeing you soon!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic - loved the jalapeno poppers, wow. We didn't have one bad meal among the four of us and the service was great."}
{"text":"This place gets a 3 star review because I thought my cucumber salad was way too sweet.  It tasted like it had sugar all over it.  I do like the atomophere and the menu has expanded a lot to include Chinese and Korean food as well.  The food is ok  and Id say the service is a little slow but they are definitely friendly, just seem to forget about you after you get your food."}
{"text":"Nacho Mama and the lettuce wrap was INCREDIBLE! House Cab was a great deal also. The Shogun lettuce wraps are my favorite. Also, my kids love the orange chicken! (Ask for the cheater chopsticks)"}
{"text":"Found this place through a Yelp search when I got hungry. And it was a great find.   The sushi rolls were a good size, fresh, and came out fast.  The house wine was inexpensive and good.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  I only wish it was closer to where I live, because it would be a regular spot for me.    I was most impressed with the size of the sushi rolls. They seemed to be 25% larger than most places make.  I can't remember the names of the ones I had, but I would definitely buy any of them again."}
{"text":"NOW I know why this place was getting bad reviews. Actually I am still not sure because I got great service the first 4 or 5 times I went there and now saw a new owner sign up about a month ago and decided to go there again after being told a 45 minute wait across the street and Zushi was dead and I know why after this experience. They had one waitress on the floor and it took a long time to get her to come over. Ordered and told her no on the soup and she said it was free and still brought it, VERY DISGUSTING!!! Then a large table came in about the time the guy finished making our sushi and she went over and took the other tables order about 15 minutes and they guy didn't bring our food over, the waitress did after 20 minutes after it was rolled. It wasn't even rolled very tight, kept falling apart. I will NEVER GO BACK AGAIN, Unfortunately.  I liked the atmosphere, but seems like the quality of food and service has went down hill."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! New to the NE area of Mesa we were looking for a local sushi spot. It's dangerous that we're as close to this one as we are! An amazing selection of rolls, great prices and surprisingly large servings! Add to the even better happy hour deals and you've guaranteed you'll see me again!"}
{"text":"Yup poor service converted the rating to a 1 star. No Lauren wasn't good, waited 20 minutes at the bar and made eye contact twice wasn't asked for what I would like to drink at all.   Eventually my kind neighbor got up and called out her name and then she asked me what I wanted. No apology, nothing.  Walked out without ordering anything. Thanks for spoiling my weekend Jenny and ensuring that I never come back."}
{"text":"We've been going to zushi for several years and our visit tonight was the worst.  The beef in the fried rice, bulgogi and short ribs was so tough and  full of fat and gristle it was inedible.   The bulgogi beef tasted like the meat was turning rancid.  The condition of the restaurant has suffered too.  The booth fabric is so worn that sitting on the seats is painful in shorts due to cracking of the vinyl.  Our waiter said, as he brought the bill, \"Doing anything about your food is beyond my power but here is some mochi.\"  Really? Sad to say but this is our last time eating here."}
{"text":"Sushi is average but the atmosphere and attitude shine.  We eat here often.  Outstanding happy hour."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally and each time I do I wonder why I don't come here more often. The service is great and the food is as well. Very satisfied. The sushi is super good."}
{"text":"Stay away!!! This was the worst teppanyaki experience of my life.  The chef was super rude, not friendly and funny that I've experienced in other places.  There weren't any sauces served with meal, the wait staff was horribly unprofessional.  Food was barely edible on top of all this.  Do not become unfortunate victims of wasted time and money like we did."}
{"text":"4 stars for the Chinese food! Wow that was delicious! I was very hesitant to go back to Zushi again, but you can't beat the location. I figured we'd try it and if it tasted bad, I'd order the wonton soup. There was no need to order anything else because it was so good.  I am not a fan of the sushi (as posted in my last review), but the Chinese food is on point! We had the szechuan shrimp, the shrimp fried rice, and combination rice. So freaking good! I've been craving Chinese since I left Ca and was looking for somewhere close and tasty and I've found the perfect spot. A bit pricey, which is why the 4 stars instead of 5. Combination rice was $16.50 and shrimp fried rice was $15.50 which is crazy high, but I'm still happily stuffed, so I can't complain too much. We'll be back."}
