{"text":"My first experience was not terribly positive. I ordered a very overpriced burger (the special). The meat was mushy and entirely without flavor. They charged me $2.50 for fries on top of the $12 for the burger. 

The fries looked seasoned but were bland, as was the dipping sauce. All in all, I would never go back for lunch but might try Longtable as a happy hour destination. 

On the positive side, it is attractively decorated and the beer selection looked impressive."}
{"text":"This place offers a fun atmosphere with good food and beer selections. I dig the community table setting as it makes this place more social than most."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review from Longtable because I'm so dang excited to tell everyone how fabulous this place is top-to-bottom! 
The food!! Holy smokes. I had the smoked trout salad and farro side. So much flavor and texture in both. Farro was cinnamon/fall-esk, but savory - exactly as was described to me by my server/cashier. The salad was a touch heavy on the dressing, but when it's green goddess, you drink it up. Good portion of trout and the goat cheese brought it home.
I loved shopping for my own beverage. A little unorthodox, but sometimes seeing and touching the can/bottle helps. It's well organized and a wide variety.
Can we talk about the service?! Patrick was incredibly knowledgeable of the menu and very patient for a first-timer like me. My food came out incredibly fast, and again - the taste!
If I didn't live in Indianapolis, this would be my jam every week."}
{"text":"A decent new option in downtown Middleton, which desperately needs more options. Have visited 3 times with friends each time. The duck salad is excellent - when they have it in stock, and the beer on tap has offered a very nice rotating selection. The brisket sandwich is tasty and savory, and the boards are nice selections of delectable morsels. There's only counter service, which actually makes it easy to get in and out without waiting forever for an overworked server. Downsides: if there are more than 10 people in the place, it's so loud you can't hear the person next to you scream bloody murder (acoustics are terrible). Some of the staff seems rather ... unenthusiastic about the idea of their food and service. The community burger is dry and unremarkable, and there's no hint of the promised green chile flavor in the sauce. And don't count on a \"bowl\" of soup being more than about a cup and half of food, or on the server to do anything other than drop it in front of you and spill it in the process before walking away sheepishly."}
{"text":"Man was I excited for this place.. 

The concept seemed right up my alley, a large beer selection, seemingly delicious food options, a welcoming community environment that's close to home. I was sorely disappointed. Last night, my boyfriend and I stopped by for the first time, we were slightly surprised to see counter service only but didn't let that hinder our judgement. It was packed full on a Tuesday night, normally that's a good sign. Being so new I'm sure that's been the case for the past few months. Unfortunately, that's where our first annoyance arose, like I said, it is good to see a place booming with business but the acoustics were terrible. We could barely focus on what we were saying between the two of us. Those garage doors are going to be a life saver in the summer. 

Onto food and drink...we found a spot by the window, assessed the menu and made up our mind on food for the evening. We went with the meatballs, a spicy Italian sausage, a side salad and an order of frites with saffron aioli and curry ketchup, got two beers to pair. Our dinner was prompt to hit the table, we quickly indulged. 

The frites were first up to bat, they were enjoyable, the sauces were pretty good too. The meatballs came next, this is where the meal took a turn for the worse. The description sounded delectable, I was ready for an explosion of flavor. I'm aware that lamb can be dry, I assumed the yogurt sauce would moisten them up if need be. I took one bite and it was the weirdest combination. There was no depth, just bland and some overpowering spice. The meat was indeed very dry, dry and very bland. It seemed as if the chef tried to soup up the flavor of this lacking meat with what tasted like an offensive amount of ginger, turmeric or a similar spice. It absolutely killed my tastebuds. I love spice and flavor but this was absurd. It was completely inedible. I'm not ultra picky either, I'll usually try to at least finish something to not be wasteful but I simply couldn't. Another disappointment was the portion for the price, I understand lamb isn't cheap but three crappy meatballs for $12.50, man did that hurt. 

We were far to eager for the sausage to arrive, hoping that'd make up for the meatballs, it didn't. It had the same exact problem, bland as ever, with a similar flavor used, just not as heavily. The side salad was what it was, average tossed greens I don't have much to say beyond that. 

We wanted to tell someone of the heavy displeasure but felt awkward toting our food up to the counter while they were clearly busy. This is where I wish there was a server to inform of our issues, possibly allowing us to try something different.  

I really hope for the sake of the place that it was just an off day, someone prepped something wrong, I don't know. I hate to say it but this was one of the worst meals I've had in a while. I'd consider returning for the beer or wine, possibly a cheese or meat board. Other than that I was rudely turned off.   :("}
{"text":"Long table beer cafe is an interesting new spot out in Middleton offering a modern element to classic Wisconsin foods like brats, curds,  and beer. Definitely a much needed addition to the neutrality that serves as much of the restaurants and hang outs in the downtown area. 

Walking in to this place there is a very communal feel alongside a smoky scented atmosphere (though the actual air isn't smoky!). The music is loud and laid back. To the left is a private tasting area and to the right is an open refrigerator filled with at least 100 beers, a deli fridge with charcuterie options, a place to order, and finally a bar with taps and seats. No hard liquor at the bar; just beer and wine. The tables are long.

The menu is focused with a few appetizers, sandwiches(including sausages and classic sandwiches but no standard burger), snacks, and charcuterie boards. Classic options like cheese curds and French fries are present. The cheese curds have no option of simple classic accompaniments. In other words, no ranch!Near the counter a community burger where proceeds are given to charity, a nice touch.

I decided to order a brat and cheese curds. The curds were breaded in a corn meal better that tastes light and crispy. The brat was initially celebrated for its awesome bun to meat ratio but fell short in that it was under cooked and under seasoned. Literally the inner half of the sausage was pink and cold to taste and therefore it was thrown out.

Overall a cool new spot but some of the fundamentals should be improved upon."}
{"text":"This felt like a small, hipster Hofbrauhaus. The concept is cool - you walk in, pick some beer from the cooler or tap, go to the register and order, then sit at a table where they bring you your food. The service was good and the staff was knowledgeable. 
We ordered cheese curbs and the BBQ platter. The curds were just fine, and a little too oily. They did come out piping hot and super fast. I would have appreciated some dipping sauce too. The BBQ platter was big - I'm glad we shared it. The brisket was great, and it had this pickled jalapeno and carrot goodness on top. The chicken wings were overcooked and really dry. The pulled pork was fine, but a little sweet for my taste. The frites were also great! But they gave us a laughably small amount of dipping sauce, so we went back and got another laughably small amount. 
All in all - it's a fun place, but the food is nothing special. I'd go back for frites and beer with friends before dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Longtable is a nice little hipster spot in Middleton. They have a large selection of bottled beers and ciders. A smaller menu of appetizer type options. I didn't get any food from there but have heard it's all ok but normal, nothing out of the ordinary or unique. My main cons was that the place has horrible acoustics, so it's very loud which makes it hard to talk to whoever is with you. And like the name says, they have long tables there, so you will end up sitting by other people which was also kind of problematic depending on how people space themselves out and how large your group is. Bathrooms were very nice and clean. The chairs/seating are very uncomfortable though in the dining area. 

Right off the bat when I was there, I wanted to order one of their special beers on tap to give it a try, and of course, they said \"oh we're out of that\". Not a good start. I don't go order drinks with a back up plan, so that was just annoying that they were already out and it was maybe 6 or 7pm on a Friday.... at a beer café. To buy your beer whether you grab it from the display (bottles) or to get whatever is on tap, you have to go up to the counter each time. So the line can get long and did, when I was there and they only had 2 people working registers. Whoever is working the register is also grabbing your beers so it definitely got slow. So when they were out of what I wanted, it was too late for me to grab something from the fridge display so I just had to pick someone else at random because I didn't want to get back in line. Not to mention it was so loud I had to practically yell to the guy at the register.

Overall a cute place, but I can't say I'd come here on my own without an invite to meet up with others who are already there."}
{"text":"As a long time fan of the Brasserie V, I was looking forward to trying out their latest creation.  The place was almost full on a Tuesday night. The food did not disappoint ... the brisket was delicious, as well as the burger my wife had. The sides were interesting; I liked my garbanzo based one. The cheese curds I ordered never arrived.  I went up to the register and cancelled them, since we were done eating. 

The beer selection is awesome like I expected.

Service and dining area upkeep were definitely lacking. We sat at a table that had several empty glasses and cans and discarded napkins. It seemed like it had been like that for some time.  Nobody ever came to pick up, even after been there discussing beers and food for 10+ minutes. There were no napkins on the utensils bucket, nor there were any knives. Some knives arrived just went we were leaving 2 hours later.

I don't want to sound too critical since I know they will get better, and it is a new establishment.  I do plan to return!  I am just not certain at this point if the level of \"service\" related to the counter approach can match the excellent food and beers available. I would rather see table service, even with the shared long table seating approach, which I liked."}
{"text":"Service was not very friendly and the cheese curds were not good at all. Don't order the pretzel appetizer.  It's very small for the price.  The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good but I will definitely not rush back."}
{"text":"I want this place to do well because it's down the street, but they really need to work on their food. I went with a big group and the consensus was that most of the dishes were not up to par and overpriced. The cheese curds were flavorless and the breading was gummy, the farro was over salted. I really liked the goat cheese puffs! Overall, the space is cool for having a beer. I hope the food improves."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to heaven. What a fun concept. I love the sharing board and the beer selection was great. I like wine but tried a new beer. They have great fries and sandwiches. Kid and family friendly. Nice place."}
{"text":"Great food! My husband and I don't drink alcohol, but I noticed there were many beer choices. It's a very lively atmosphere when it's crowded! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a very fun place - It feels like the taphouse version of Five Guys burgers and fries.

Sausages / Bratwursts - Woohool! They use great seasoning and condiments and cook the meat very well

Sandwhich plates - also pretty good.

Salads - The smoked trout salad is pretty skimpy on trout and kindof short on toppings. I wouldn't recommend it.

The \"Curry Ketchup\" available as a sauce with their fries is FANTASTIC."}
{"text":"This place is new (I think) so I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Very confusing as to how to order. We we finally figured it out we ordered a sample board for 2. They messed it up. Some samples we thought we were going to get,we didnt. I ordered a Saison on draft and the bartender went to a small refrigerator and poured my beer from a metal pitcher????? Was this a mistake beer that they were too cheap to just pour out or something?"}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon on a graduation day. We were worried that we might not be able to get a table. But that wasn't an issue. No wait staff to serve you. You order your drinks (off the tap list or off their vast selection of fridge on the side) and food on your own. You take your drinks and number to your table and your food will be delivered to your table. 

Food options include sandwiches, sharable plates, soup/salad and appetizers. Not a lot of vegetarian choices, but some. If you are into a delicious quick bite, this is not a bad choice. 

Drink menu includes tap beers, bottled beers, sodas  and some wines. My husband is a cider/Meade drinker and he was quite impressed with the options there.

This is not a cheap tap house. The price is on the high end side. But not a bad place for a group of friends or family to sit around the communal table and have some fine drinks."}
{"text":"A solid addition to the Middleton eating and drinking scene.  Beer selection and tap system is top notch. The same owner as Brasserie V and here they have much fewer taps but always several beers I've never seen on tap in Madison before.
The shared plates are perfect for a group or a meal for a couple...and that is the small size. I've never even seen a large plate yet!  
The sandwiches I've had have been ok, but the brisket was fatty and messy. I pointed out a large piece of fat to the bartender and he made a face and walked away.  Hence to only 4 stars.  It's gonna be a great thing when we get our week of 80 degree days in July and they open up the glass doors before the snow flies again.  




one."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit to Longtable Cafe. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food tasted just fine. If I had a wish, it would be for more draft beer variety. A lot was sold out and there wasn't much for someone like me, a pilsner drinker. True, there is their wall of beer and I'm sure there would have been a good choice for me, but stepping up in front of 100s of beers is a hard call for me. We loved our window table and to watch life pass in front. Kudos to Longtable. Come here relaxed and ready to have fun."}
{"text":"Nice selection of beers and wine. We had soups and a Charcuterie Board. The chicken Tortilla soup was of the chain. Patrick our bartender and the entire staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Really enjoyed the the whole experience."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here.  I had the brisket sandwich and my girlfriend had the Italian sandwich, each of us also had one drink.  Our total with a 20% tip, which I don't think you need to tip at this type of location, was $48.  Brisket was good however prices were too high for the food and service."}
{"text":"Food was pretty darn good, but definitely pricey. We were not too thrilled with the beer selection though, but that might be because we're not into English or Belgium beers, of which Longtable had a bunch. We would definitely be back if the American craft beer selection were better, but the food alone isn't worth returning for. Fries are amazing though! Goat cheese puffs and wild boar sausage were also tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious food, well designed, friendly staff. The brisket is really good or try the trout sandwich for something lighter. And of course the fries are the best anywhere."}
{"text":"This place just popped up in the new construction behind the Village Green in downtown Middleton.  It is a unique and very welcome addition to the area.  The schtick is that they have several \"long tables\" to encourage a social and interactive environment.  I stopped by to check it out shortly after they opened with some co-workers for some after work drinks.  Overall very impressed.  They didn't have A \"happy hour\" but you could do cheaper 9 oz pours, and find something budget friendly in their open cooler.  They have lots of shareables (frites, charcuterie boards, etc) as well as salads and sandwiches.  Clean, modern feel.  Plenty to satisfy all of our different tastes ( sours, IPA, stouts, German biers, etc). My friend was beyond excited when he spotted a German beer in the cooler from an area he had just visited.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Was really glad I had the chance to check these place out a few nights ago with a friend.  The concept is a little different: community tables, order at the front, and then continuously come back up to add to your tab if more drinks are required.  It has a fun, rustic vibe.  I was surprised that they didn't have more beers on tap though.  The food (charcuterie, mussels, and frites) were all pretty good...could use a little improvement in that department but I am sure its a work in progress.  I will def come back soon!!"}
{"text":"Nope. Looks cool, is well decorated, and a good concept. It's just not done well in terms of management in my opinion has a lack of warmth and fun."}
{"text":"I could not wait to get my little paws on a cool draft in a big 16 oz glass at this place. I really enjoyed the ambiance, the long tables are cool and it is obvious a lot of thought went into this place. I noticed that they have the garage door windows, which I can't wait to experience in warmer weather. I had the pulled pork and frites and Babe had the smoked brisket, both were very good. I like the humongous selection of beer by the bottle and a nice selection of drafts. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with my first visit.  I ordered the hot dog.  For $7 with a side it should be a big sausage or, better yet, two dogs (on 2 buns).  I was still hungry after I was done.  
The place struck me as over-priced but seems to use very high-quality ingredients.  
I'll certainly give them another try sometime, but I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"Longtable is Middleton's newest foodie addition, and it well welcomed. The service is fast and the food of good quality. I really enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich. The slaw on top was really nice. Companion had the Italian sub - it was as expected and substantial. 

The Frites were tasty - we really enjoyed the Curry Ketchup... nice kick and slow burn. The sides were pretty interesting. The garbanzo Bean salad is rich and satisfying. The Farro salad was my favorite of the two however. 

Huge tap and bottled beer selection and a decent wine selection. Longtable seems like its going to be a nice addition to the redesign of downtown Middleton."}
{"text":"Visited the Longtable for the first time last night and I was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely unlike any place in the Middleton area. The food was delicious and I loved seeing the list of farmers and growers the restaurant buys from. The only thing I kinda had an issue with was the fact that they sell beer/wine by the bottle or the glass - at an expensive price. Unfortunately you can't buy a pitcher of beer which is a lot more cost effective - I was with two other people last night and it cost us $19 for three glasses, not pints, of beer. I'll definitely go back but I don't think I'll order alcohol anymore because the food + beer for three people cost $52. That cost doesn't sound as bad as I thought for three people, but considering the portion sizes of food and beer, it was a bit too pricey."}
{"text":"Restaurant offers gluten-free options. Unfortunately,  they mixed up my order and I did not catch the error until after I had eaten half my meal."}
{"text":"Fabulous new venue.  Adding a much-needed local dining and beer option to Middleton/Madison, Longtable is the perfect place to dine and drink.  The staff has been stellar since day one, and the menu is anything but lacking in both options and flavor.  Enjoy the vast selection of beers to-go, and don't skimp on the goat cheese puffs!"}
{"text":"I don't write many of these. I'll start out by saying the food was good. The selection of beer is fantastic. The lady at the register that helpful and was very nice and accommodating. The service however was not. First of all we picked a small area to sit but, after our apps arrived and were eating them we were told by the owner that in 40 min a party would taking the room for a private tasting event. He said we could stay but, given it was only 40 min away we accommodated him and sat in another area. When the food started coming out they only brought out my sons and my friends meals. There was no explanation. The owner and the the waitstaff kept looking in our direction and we waited. It wasn't until after my guests had finished their meals did my meal arrive. I asked if it was normal practice to bring meals out in this manner and the woman said it was not. Later she returned and said that they would take a percentage off my bill. I can report it was the smallest percentage they could've taken. Three meals, two beers with an app was still $70+ after their \"refund\".  My family and I and friend have all worked in the service industry...they'll need to step it up and iron out the creases in their kitchen organization and their customer service skills before I return..which will be never. There are plenty of places in the metro area to spend money at. I had high hopes for them."}
{"text":"Although it is a fast food format, our food took over an hour to come, was middling in taste, and the service wasn't any better. The brisket was very fatty, the pulled pork wasn't much better. Fries were just ok. The cheese curds tasted like the oil they were fried in and were over salted. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Overall, a great addition to the Middleton area with a unique proposition as a beer and sausage lovers mecca. It's sort of a DIY place where you order upfront, food is brought out and you go back up to counter if you need anything else. 

Our group did try three different items (2 sausage and 1 hot sandwich) along with the cheese curds and each needed more seasoning. We were sad to see that salt and pepper weren't supplied on the tables, which only works if an establishment is putting forth well-seasoned dishes consistently. The cooler of beer is a wonder though."}
{"text":"I am only writing this review because of the server i had on my last visit. his name was John and he was the single best server i've ever had, anywhere in my life. I wish i could have him as my server at every restaurant i go to. I really hope that the management at Longtable, has also noticed this in him and he gets the treatment he deserves. John's attitude is what every person in the service industry should be striving to achieve.

Thanks again John, you were awesome."}
{"text":"This place is great at what it does! It serves nifty beers (and wines), charcuterie plates, sandwiches, soups, salads and small, tidy appetizers in a trendy environment. While we were there the staff spent a great deal of time on us talking about the place, its intent and its products. The customers all looked to be planted for some time, and a few were even playing games. I'm happy to welcome an establishment that welcomes the kind of customer who likes to park it for awhile. 

We ordered a tap and a bottle, as well as the stuffed mushrooms. There were plenty of appealing food and drink items on the menu we're excited to return and try. I also think it's worth mentioning that the age of the patrons are totally mixed. The noise level was lively, but we were able to hold a conversation without raising our voices or having any difficulty hearing one another. We'll be back!

12/26/17
Wow...the \"Longtables\" have turned....1) the service was dumbfounding and 2) food was a huge turn-off for multiple reasons. 

It was so bad, we couldn't even stay to order entrées. This was our second visit. Honesty, I am at a loss as to where I should I start. 
We arrived and found a spot, ready to begin playing the game we brought from home and drink a few beers, while noshing on some of the items we hadn't had the opportunity to try the last time we visited. This would not happen for us. 
I ordered one of their beers on tap and learned they were out of it and would have to pick something else. Ok, no problem, I did that. I placed an order for 2 appetizers and a side and waited for them to arrive at our table. 
Once the frites, lamb meatballs and garbanzo beans arrived we had a major surprise. First of all, the waitress who delivered them, did not deliver any plates. We asked for 3 plates and she told us they were \"running low, I'll see if I can find any.\" She quickly came back with 2 plates. When we reminded her there were 3 of us she said they were out of plates. It should be noted that the business was not packed, there was plenty of available seating in multiple locations in the restaurant. 
We also needed silverware, asked for this too and she said \"there's silverware right there\" and pointed to a basket next to us, or where it's supposed to be, but it was empty. She realized it was empty as soon as she pointed and then said \"oh let me go get some.\" She went and got some silverware and when she came back she didn't give them to us but instead put the three forks in the public silverware glass forcing us to get them ourselves. So much is wrong with this...I cant even. There were no, \"I'm sorry's\" or \"I'll keep an eye out for a plate for you\" or a number of possible polite common sense expressions that could have been said. 
Once the meatballs arrived, we realized that they were merely room temperature, even cold. We thought this was unusual. When I went to pay I was asked if everything was OK and I told the woman that I was surprised to discover that the lamb meatballs were in fact, served cold, and that I would have liked the menu to specify that this was the case. She said to me, \"oh yeah, me too. I don't like them like that either. I would expect them to be a warm, hearty dish but they're not.\" She went on to explain that she's not a lamb fan in general, which did not make me feel any more assured and it did not make the meatballs taste any better. 
If indeed these meatballs are supposed to be served cold then this is a big fail. If these meatballs are not supposed to be served cold, then why did she think that they were? If she didn't think that they were supposed to be served cold then why did she tell me they were? I'm not sure what's going on here, but I know these meatballs are a big mistake. All in all, we just couldn't overlook the major mistakes from not one, but two of the service staff, and we certainly could not overlook the food quality. 
I haven't even gone into the three different sauces we ordered with the frites because that is a whole 'nuther long explanation, but two of the three sauces were flavorless (and that's incredible considering their flavorful descriptions). Not to mention the fact that these sauces were served to 1/4 of the ramekin full at $.75 apiece. Yikes...."}
{"text":"Went with my husband for his birthday. The drink options are spectacular but the prices are a bit high. Food menu is limited but good. Would definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Came to Longtable Beer Cafe for dinner on a Saturday night. The place was pretty busy. Like the name, all of the tables are very long, meant for multiple groups to sit at each table, in a communal style. First, you walk past a massive large self serve open cooler full of bottled beer. You pick what beers you want and take them with you to the cash register to order food. Then, you can seat yourself at one of the long tables to eat and drink. We got the cheese curds, which were basically amazing. This place had a pretty chill vibe and had garage door windows which can be opened up in the summer. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Just opened and will be great addition to downtown Middleton. Food was delicious! Very good beer and cider selections. Good number of televisions for gameday. Loud, social atmosphere, shared tables. Excellent setting for friends, not for an intimate date. Improve: beers on tap signs are hard to read."}
{"text":"Please don't come here, I live in the area and plan to be here quite a bit.  Good tap selection, outstanding bottled beer selection.  Food? Great.  Polish sausage, pulled pork, frites prepared as they should be, beer cheese soup, all very good.  Lively atmosphere on a Friday night.  Counter service is fine by me.  If you love the \"V\" (Brasserie V) you will love this place too.  So like I said, please don't come here, at least not regularly, I selfishly do not want you here.  A great addition to the downtown Middleton dining scene."}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with a group of friends. Like their concept and beer menu. Food was just ok. This was my first time there. Will definitely go back. Want to try their food again before writing a full review of their food. Cheese curds were good."}
{"text":"What a KILLER addition to Middleton!  We love this place and have been three times already!  Insane bottled beer selection, awesome rotating taps, and the food is delicious.  The frites with house made dipping sauces are so good, the pork sandwich is worth every calorie, and the brats are so well done.  Getting your own beer / counter service is a little different than what we're used to, but not a hindrance to enjoying this place.  The only reason that I went 4 stars is that the acoustics in here are quite terrible...really difficult to carry on a conversation when they're busy."}
