{"text":"It was quite good, really empty after lunch time too.   I met the new owner/chef who said he was just reopening the place and trying to start on promoting the restaurant. It is almost impossible to find, and you actually have to enter the office building it is located within to find the front door or as I later learned, enter through the open patio door. It is the first building on the right north of York Mills Centre.   They have a daily special, on Wednesday it is a Jerk chicken meal that's under ten dollars. Most of the meals on the menu are under 10 dollars and quite filling. I had a chicken-avocado wrap in a multigrain tortilla, with some really tasty, seasoned crispy fries for 10 bucks with tax.   The avocado was super fresh and the chicken tasted like it was fresh (not frozen strips) and the mayo-based dressing was light enough to taste the other ingredients.  The decor is really dated, which makes it more a lunch time spot until they decide to update the old wooden tables and plastic patio furniture. Service was casual and good as I was the only patron at the time.   I would go back again to grab a quick bite outside during the summer."}
{"text":"This place is the best-kept secret in the city.  If you don't work in the immediate neighbourhood, you would never find the place.  And if you do, you still need someone to point it out to you.  I've worked nearby on and off for the past 10 years, but I'm sure the place hasn't changed in 20 years.  The dine-in room feels a bit like someone's rec room.  It's comfortable and lacking pretensions of any sort.  On a summer's day, they have a great patio with plenty of tables and equal parts shade and sun.    I was inspired to write this review today while biting in to one of their great french fries.  These are seriously the best fries I've had in a long time.  Crisp, meaty, not too brown and not too greasy.  They make a great club sandwich, a decent salad, and other office deli standards.   The family that runs the place are warm, friendly and attentive.  Prices are reasonable.  Great place for lunch or cheap beers with friends."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find, but it's a gem. It's a true mom and pop shop that has consistent business year round.  The decor is dated, reminds me of some German house. I don't even know what a German house is or looks like but it just gives me a vibe.  But the food is great for this area. Burger is solid option and never disappoints. I've had sandwiches and they are great. Their fries are always tasty, has a perfect crispiness to them.  Compared to other places in the area, this place is cheap for beers. Though I don't think they open too late after work.  They accept all types of credit cards which is great! They are kind of a no-nonsense kinda place, not too many pleasantries. They leave you alone to go about your food and discussion."}
{"text":"Hidden spot, love their fish n chips, some of the best chips in town. Good customer service, they need a better sign out front because you would never know it's there unless you work in the office building."}
