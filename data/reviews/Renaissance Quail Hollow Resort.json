{"text":"We stayed here for business and we were surprised a place like this is here. My co-worker and I both reserved two queen bed rooms and they were so different. Hers was much larger while mine was much smaller. The bed was comfortable and the hotel staff was very nice.

For dinner...that was the slowest dinner ever. The food was was below par. Find something else!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty nice resort/hotel for being located 2 minutes off the 90 about 30 minutes north of Cleveland.  

I was most unfortunately roomed in one of the rooms on the very opposite end of the hotel from the lobby-I put in a good 2 mile walk each morning getting to and from the banquet rooms (plus 2 elevators in the process). 

The golf course is challenging and lovely, the ladies' tees are quite generous, and it only ate 3 of my golf balls.   The banquet food was meh.  Think run-of-the-mill Marriott for comparision."}
{"text":"One of the worst nights that I have spent in a hotel - EVER. 

Because there were 2 large parties, despite the fact that I booked the room well in advance, we were put at the butt end of the earth it seemed - all the way at the end of the furthest building. I could have lived with that. The blisters on my feet and my sore calf muscles would have eventually healed.

What I absolutely could not live with was some young jerk pulling the fire alarm at 4am. I can't prove it, but I bet my bottom dollar that there was LOTS of underage drinking going on here that night with the gaggles of young kids stumbling around at all hours laughing hysterically and bumping into things. Many of the kids looked under 21, again I can't prove that they were underage, nor can I prove that they were in fact drunk, but given the way they appeared, and the immaturity of the prank...

While I understand that it was not the hotel's fault, nor was it their fault that the response time of the Painesville FD absolutely STUNK, what I WILL fault them on is the way they handled my complaint about being woken up at 4am, continuing to be kept awake at 5am, their lack of breakfast availability at 6am, and the attitudes of the front desk person at each of these hours. It may not be your fault, but it IS your problem. And the lack of owning up to that or attempt to soothe a sleep-deprived, cranky guest from Illinois just rubbed me all kinds of the wrong way. 

After twisting a few arms, I at least was given a coupon for a free breakfast (once the restaurant opened, hours later). 

I was never able to get back to sleep. It was a horrible way to start the first day of my vacation. And in the end, what I will remember most is NOT that some young jerk pulled the fire alarm, but the completely apathetic, unapologetic, and crappy way the employees handled it."}
