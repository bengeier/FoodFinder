{"text":"This rating is for the brunch alone - I had one of the worst meals of my life here a couple years ago and so can't speak for the dinners now; I'm assuming the ownership is different.

Good food, good price, good patio when the weather's nice.

*Since writing the above, I had the misfortune of again going here for dinner.
Yeah... that says it all."}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place and I now bring along friends a lot. 
The regular menu has a great selection. I especially love the French Onion Soup, Spinach Crabmeat and Shrimp dip (and the thin chips that they come with) and stuffed rainbow trout. 

I recently realized that they serve brunch too and that menu is amazing too! Eggs benedict with caviar and the french toast are 2 of my faves! :D"}
{"text":"Friendly pub, the owner Syed goes all out to ensure his guests are enjoying themselves. Open mike and live music nights are fun."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on Mother's Day.

  Food was fantastic with a large portion of fruits that I could barely finish, and amazing home fries.  I ordered the eggs benny, my first egg was perfectly cooked, however my second one was pretty much cooked through.

The reason the review is only 3 stars and not 4, is because our group of 4 had to wait just under an hour to get our food.  I understand it was Mother's Day, but I feel like they should have been more prepared for the larger number of patrons that day.  We were all really hangry and overly caffeinated for all the coffee we consumed while waiting on an empty stomach for our food to arrive.

  I will likely go back for brunch again, hopefully next time we will get our food before I become hangry, which is not pleasant for anyone."}
{"text":"We called to make reservations mid-week for 10 ppl for brunch on Sunday August 2. When we got there, they said they couldn't find our reservation. What a way to start the meal.

DRINKS:

Water & Wine - 
It took about 30+ minutes for our water and white wine to come. When the wine came, it was a bottle of red. Our server assured us it was white. Clearly it was not since it says \"red wine\" on the bottle. 

Orange Juice -
We ordered two orange juices. When it came, it was watered down orange juice. Probably 90% water, 10% orange juice. We told the server our issue with the orange juice. They came back to us to tell us they ran out of orange juice. Instead of telling us there was no orange juice left, they just gave us watered down juice from the drink gun in hopes we would not say anything.

Caesar - 
We ordered three Caesars. All of which came in different size glasses, with clumps of wet rimmer. There was no vodka added at all. None of us finished the Caesars. Waste of money.

FOOD:

Steak and Eggs -
There was a huge insect wing in our steak - embedded within the meat. What more can I say. 

SERVICE:
Our group did not have cutlery for the first 30 minutes. When food came, there was still no cutlery. We asked for cutlery and it took another 10 minutes before ANY cutlery came. We tried looking for cutlery ourselves. Apparently they were still washing cutlery in the kitchen. When it DID come, it was all wet. Ended up grabbing napkins ourselves and manually wiping down each fork and knife.

There was no jam for our toast the entire time we were there with our breakfast. We didn't bother requesting as we knew it would have taken light years for it to come. Servers claim it was a busy day. Well, patio was half full. Inside restaurant was not busy at all. 

FOOD WAS MEDIOCRE. SERVICE WAS MEH. 
Would I come back again? Don't think so.  You shouldn't either."}
{"text":"My friend recommended Main's Mansion for their brunch, as we were both craving eggs and toast. The restaurant is in an old house with wooden floors and a nice patio, which mends with the old architect of Main Street Markham. The interior felt like a pub and there was free parking next to the restaurant. 

As I had the baby in the stroller, the steps were a bit steep, and for the life of me, I could not carry the stroller up the stairs. There was little staff on a cold Saturday, so there was no hostess to help me out as well. Good thing my friend came to the rescue as I felt pretty stranded outside. Do keep this in mind mommas with strollers!

The brunch items ranged from about $10 to $24 with a traditional fare of eggs and bacon, omelettes, eggs benedict, steak and sandwiches. 

I opted for the traditional Greek omelette which had onions, bell peppers and feta cheese. What makes the brunch stand out is the amount and quality of their fruits, which included dragon fruit, star fruit and even pomegranate! The portions are generous as well. 

This is my first time there, so I would not be able to provide further recommendations of their menu. If visitors are looking for a traditional breakfast with a nice balance of carbs/eggs/meat and fruit and large portions, this is the place to be! 

I will come back in the summer to try their lunch or dinner items, and enjoy the view from their patio."}
{"text":"Probably the best eggs benedict I've ever had. Massive portions with tons of fresh fruit (better than Cora's). Great, quick service. I don't think I have a single negative thing to say!"}
{"text":"One star because the server was
Lovely and did her job well. Other than that a major letdown. Bad food sketchy clientele"}
{"text":"One of the best greasy spoon place for brunch. The meals are hearty and surprisingly pleasing to the palette. My girlfriend and i stumbled upon this place after hearing some good words from her friends a few years back. It's not a place where you'd expect good food from as it is essentially a pub. You seat yourself and the server comes to you as common in public houses. 

I went to this place twice and both times we walked out full and satisfied. The menu is fairly standard as you get your eggs, sausage, bacon and pancakes. The meat is juicy and surprisingly good. The portion is more than enough for a person. It's either good enough to share amongst two or enough to take home for later enjoyment. The second time around I ordered the Prime Time Steak and Eggs. The steak was juicy and fairly big as it is a 9oz. It comes with 3 eggs, abundance variety of fruit and of course toasts. For $20 it is not bad at all. Well worth the price and I would say it's very good value for the money. 

The fruits are oddly sweet. We had to ask the waitress how they prepared the fruit since it felt like it was dunked in sugar prior to serving. Everything is sweet. The waitress reassured us that the fruit were simply prepared fresh. It does look fresh and I can only say that they know how to pick their fruit. 

The food was very good, the only drawback is that you don't exactly get \"clean\" stuff. Twice we were there the table wasn't exactly clean and the milk has other people's used capsules in there. Regardless I am nick picking. I would go back again and again simply for the great good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10
Food: 9.5/10
Atmosphere: 7.5/10
Service: 8.5/10

In comparison to all other brunch places, Main's Mansion by far is in the lead. 

The only drawback is if you are not seated in the sun room, the main dining area is a bit dark (it's a pub after all!) and the bathrooms downstairs are as cold as ice. However, if you are looking for fantastic breakfast food that does not skimp on portions, this is the place for you. 

Most meals come with a massive heap of fruit, and lots of different kinds (strawberries, watermelon, grapes, bananas, melon, dragon fruit, oranges, and so on). I've tried the bigger breakfasts, the breakfast wraps, omelettes and even their healthier yogurt/granola options and all are great. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: you're safe to skip other brunch places and come straight here. Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"After asking the waitress( whom we had a hard time understanding due to her tongue piercing) what the daily $5.99 lunches were, we ordered 2, grilled ham and cheese sandwiches, and an order of fish and chips. These were 2 of the 5 items she had told us about. When it arrived, the fish and chips were a very large size and when we commented she told us \"oh, those aren\"t the specials\" We were in a hurry, so decided to have them. What a shock when the fish and chips turned out to be $16.99!!!! Even the 2 sandwiches were $8.99 instead of the $5.99 this girl had told us. When asked about it, she just shrugged and said that is what they cost. We paid, but will never return again or recommend this to anyone. As Main Street Markham is under construction, one would have thought they would have tried to appease us. I cannot imagine they have much business..only 2 other tables were occupied while we were there. Sorry, but you have lost 3 customers and their families!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place based on reviews....left feeling not so impressed.

My eggs Benedict was overcooked the egg was not oozy at all. We waited almost 30 min for food and honestly didn't want to send it back again to wait even longer.   

The service staff were not attentive instead they looked more interested in circle talking instead.   Prices are slightly higher than normal for brunch.  

Maybe the idea of an Irish pub serving up Persian food and brunch is just weird to me or is just not working for the owner."}
{"text":"Would give this 2 and half stars because it really was just a meh experience.

Came for late night food on a weekday and didn't expect it to be super busy but found it was relatively lively.  It's literally a giant house and your table could be in any part of the house layout - living room area, sun room area, etc.  It's quite a homey feeling, but as it's a pretty old house in a pretty old neighbourhood, expect to find the usual grime and dirt around the corners.

Menu is your typical bar food of wings and burgers and fries - I found my celery in my wings order to be a bit brown.  Otherwise the wings are passable - neither good nor bad.  I see the other reviews rave about the breakfast and will come give it a try another time."}
{"text":"Worst service/resolution I have experienced in a long time! 

You usually go here for drinks on the odd occasion at night... anyone from Markham can tell you it's not an amazing spot it's just because it's Markham and there is nowhere else to go! 

Decided to go here and dine in with a few friends (Only because liberty burger next door was closed!)... Wasn't too hungry so I decided to order the Perogies & Ceaser salad... (Not many vegetarian options but I'm sure they would have made a wrap or something if I had asked... Regardless I ordered the perogies and emphasized no Bacon... i must point out I mentioned it 3 times... in the most polite way possible... 

Waitress seemed new and careless.. She also acknowledged I'm veg! 20 min later she brings the food out... of course I find bacon all over my perogies! (Now this isn't even the problem! mistakes happen!) I advised her there is bacon and I asked for my food without it! She was baffled and confused like I had never said anything but she took it back and ensured it would be fixed...

less than 5 min later she brought the food right out again... now I get that perogies are not hard to make or don't take long but common less than 5 min? So I had to ask... was the bacon just removed. Or was it remade? Her response... \"Umm I don't know... are you allergic?\" ... so I asked if she could just find out if it was another one from scratch?

Now here is the piss off... while she is gone... I decided to go through the food and find bits of bacon still left underneath and around the food... it's clear they just did a poor attempt to remove it... now the waitress comes back and assures me they made a fresh new one... loll I told her that was clearly not the case considering there was still some bacon there ... while discussing this the owner comes over and without a hesitation advised me that it is a new dish made fresh! .. I told him that was not the case and I can see the bacon... his response... \"I made sure I rinsed off all the bacon\"... first how do you rinse off bacon from perogies... second how is it made fresh then... then he goes... \"Fine I'll just go make you a new one\"... welllll sorry to inconvenience you...... I just advised I don't want to eat that anymore ... he said \"fine no worries\" and walked away...

another 5 min... He brings the perogies over the table next to us... says something in another language and they decided to eat them... must have been his friends or something...

best part... we get the bill... and the perogies are still on it!!!! The waitress was baffled when I asked her to take a look... she didn't understand quite why I would not pay for it... i had to reinforce i didnt eat the food!!! 

Crappy experience... crappy service.... wouldn't recommend visiting here to eat after having experienced that!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch with my boyfriend and really enjoyed it! Portions are large, their sausages are super tasty, and they give loads of fruit! Love the local atmosphere, its super peaceful. Their pancakes were nothing too special though, was expecting a little better. Next time I'd probably skip out on the pancakes. Also, breakfast is a little pricy here... so probably would only return on occasion..."}
{"text":"Brunch is fantastic. Smells like an old dirty bar inside (Which is kind of is) but the food is some of the best breakfast/brunch food anywhere. 

Huge portion of fruit with every meal, and not just berries and an orange slice, great variety. 

Eggs Benedict is one of the best I have ever had, sandwiches are all solid as well.

Would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"As a bar / experience - 4 stars
Food - 3.5 stars

I passed this place for years and never tried it. Finally went in and enjoyed my experience. 

Highlights:

- Good beer selection on tap. I proceed to have 3 pints of Hoegarden 
- Service was amazing. They are quick, check to make sure you have what you need
- Nacho appetizer was really good
- Great patio - front and back
- sporting events on TV 
- \"local pub\" feel. I just felt comfortable here
- Good club sandwich
- fries are good

On the downside:
 - My friend had the burger - not the greatest
 
I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a nice little pub on Main Street Markham. The atmosphere is cozy as it really is in an old mansion, and there is a decent beer selection on tap, even if it's mostly domestic. The service is always friendly and excellent.

In terms of food, the burgers are quite good as are the perogies. My only other complaint would be that the other dishes, such as pasta and stir fires, which are decent, are a bit overpriced. I'm not sure a pub in Markham can justify $20-30 entrees,

I've heard the brunch is great here, so I'll check that out and report back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"I visited Main's Mansion on a Sunday morning for brunch, and honestly speaking, I had high high hopes for this place because not only had my friends raved about it but YELP had also raved about the huge portions and amazing food and fresh fruit etc etc. 

So knowing me, I checked the menu beforehand and was excited and ready to eat some amazing brunch. Sunday morning/afternoon arrives and we get to Main's Mansion. I step inside and right off the bat I knew something was up because it was completely empty. The restaurant had a weird odour and the furniture and decor looked dated.

We sat down, ordered (it took a while, they didn't seem to be well staffed) and then waited for our food. The food arrived and it looked just like the pictures I saw on Yelp. Ton's of overflowing fruit and large portions. The pancakes I ordered were delicious and chocolatey and soft and fluffy. Unfortunately, the Eggs Benny were a disappointment. When I typically order Eggs Benny, I expect my eggs to be covered in hollandaise sauce but at Main's Mansion, there was barely a tablespoon of hollandaise on each egg. To top it off, one of the eggs still had a piece of shell in it.. that ruined my appetite for the rest of the meal.. and also my impression of Main's.

The prices are decent for what you're getting.  Perhaps one day I'll return if all my other brunch spots are closed."}
{"text":"My mom got food poisoning at Main's Mansion on MOTHER'S Day! We went to Main's Mansion to celebrate Mother's Day. We expected to wait in line to get into the place but what we did not expect is that after ordering we would have to wait for almost 2 hrs for food! The staff was not emphatic and the attitude was if you don't like it leave. The experience was horrible and my mom is still ill, she got a parasite from this place! When we called them to let then know, they did not seem to care or take accountability."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday for dinner a couple weeks ago and was not impressed at all. The food was great when we finally received it. We could hear the kitchen ring the bell advising it was ready but the black haired waitress seemed more focused on her phone while she FaceTimed someone. It took forever to get her attention when we needed condiments or refills because again was so focused on her phone. We had to get up ourselves and walk to the bar to ask for anything. Absolutely terrible services and wouldn't recommend anyone going there on the days she works. Any other time the other girls where great and attentive but this was the worst experiences we've ever had at this establishment. Just very unprofessional and will not be returning if she is working. I understand checking and sending a quick text or if it's slow day but there was quite a few tables and could hear and see the dismay on the other customers faces. Again food was great kitchen staff did a great job but the waitress needs to put down her phone and focus on the customers"}
{"text":"FOOD: 3.5/5 - it's one of the best brunch spots in Markham! I much prefer coming here than Cora's. The food and portion is better and larger. You get a huge selection and variety of seasonal fresh fruits on the brunch menu. Sometimes you'll even get the rare dragon fruit and star fruits! I've also tried their dinner at night. Decent quality but certainly not as memorable as their brunches.

SERVICE: 1/5 - pretty much non-existent I'd say. Had to flag someone to give us menu, water and bill. I also helped myself grabbing my own seats. The servers are always too busy chatting with people at the bar.

ENVIRONMENT: 3.5/5 - pub setting with an old charm, located in the heart of Markham Main Street. It has a few TVs inside for sports. They have an outdoor patio for people who like to enjoy the weather and a sunroom for those who want to stay in."}
{"text":"I had heard some amazing things about Main's Mansion in the past little while, and it definitely didn't disappoint! 

Came by for a Sunday brunch with a couple of friends, and it was a pleasant surprise. Very much like a pub on the inside, with a couple tables here and there situated around the bar. However, the biggest surprise was the food!

I'm the kind of person that goes to a breakfast/brunch joint and has to get the traditional breakfast meal. With different options in your meats and sides, there are a good amount of variety throughout the menu. I decided for your typical 3 eggs/2 meats meal with bacon and sausage. Happy to see that the bacon was not overly crispy and the sausage was flavourful without being saltier than the ocean. The home fries were amazing, small and crunchy, and the amount of fruit given on the dish was shocking!

Service was amazing with lots quick servers and constant stream of coffee into our cups! U don't think any of our cups were empty at any point. 

Definitely would be back sometime for brunch, as the portion was more than generous for the amount of food was given. Just may want to come a little earlier as by 11AM, the place was full."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times for dinner. It is a rather big pub in the area, with many TVs showing different channels (mainly sports). At some nights, they have bands playing music in the restaurant.

I ordered a medium rare AAA New York Steak. The service is very fast and efficient, which is what I like. The steak is tender and the portion is quite decent. The best thing is that the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Other than Cora's, I really don't know any other brunch places uptown. I am so glad my friend introduced me to Mains Mansion. When I want to get my brunch fix, this is where I go! The portions are generous, the food is flavourful and the best part has to be the variety of fruit you get on your plate! It inspires me to recreate their dishes and host a brunch at home and invite friends over! Until that happens, I will look forward to trying the veggie eggs benny and the farmers breakfast and the waffles on my next subsequent visits!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a couple of my girlfriends. 

I would say this was a good change from other breakfast chains. 

I ordered the big breakfast with french toast. It took a while for our food to come... Food itself is quite average tasting.... however there was tons of fruits with my order which I enjoyed. 

Service was OK and I would say overall experience was just OK. It's pricier than breakfast chains. I probably won't make a trip back for awhile but not bad brunch place if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Yummyyyyy brunch out on the patio today! Right on the Main Street Markham. Highly recommended
Food: 4.5/5 lots of variety, large potions (especially the fresh fruit). Really yummy buttery hollandaise sauce. Try the Eggs New Orleans (with smoked salmon and caviar)... So good! 
Ambiance: 4/5 patio is great. Pub style inside
Service: 4/5 fast, friendly
Overall spring brunch experience: 4.25/5 :)"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. Delicious. Lots of fruit served on the side. Friendly staff. But overpriced. I can get everything on the menu at another breakfast joint for at least $5-$12 less. But on a special brunch occasion this is a cute place to go to with it being on Main Street Markham, you can go take a walk afterwards or grab a coffee at the Cat Cafe!"}
{"text":"delicious brunch with huge portion and great prices!   very friendly service as well.  awesome brunch place in Markham area.  strongly recommended"}
{"text":"Bunch of us came for a drink today. Door man opened the door for us. Quiet place for a drink. That's probably because it's 5pm on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing special about this bar to talk about."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with a few of my friends for brunch and we had an average experience here. The food and the portions was good but the service was not that great. After we sat done, it took them a couple minutes before we were served our water and given menus to look at. The food also took a long time to come out (around 30-35 min) and they explained there was a big table ahead of us which we understood and waited. Looking at other reviews, others have complained about the slow service on Sunday as well so maybe they should fix that problem."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for brunch. We made reservations for 5 guests outside on the patio on Victoria Day at 12PM. It was quite here given the sunny weather and it was a holiday. The menu is quite extensive with various kinds of breakfast options. I ordered the Prime Time Steak and Eggs. The steak was seasoned and cooked nicely. I heard the portions here were fairly big and they definitely load up on the amount of fruits you get with each dish. My brunch dish was quite good and filling. This meal definitely did me justice for sure! Service was a bit underwhelming as we probably waited for over 40 minutes before our meal finally arrived. Although I have to wait, it got quite busy but there is no excuse for the tardiness of the meals arriving in a timely manner. 

Overall, I though the brunch was good. Food was great and would recommend to others for sure. A suggestion for improvement in the future is that service must be improved by getting food out in a more timely manner."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: No food ordered, just making a quick review based on service and the establishment itself.

It's a pretty dark, old looking bar in a prime location on Main Street. I came here in a party of 3 after dining at Inspire next door. We had just wanted to find a new place to watch the NBA Finals game as Inspire was closing for the evening. 

Any customer would understand upon walking in that Main's is not a sports bar - but they did have the game playing on all their TVs. Ideally they'd have the TV audio on too, which they did, albeit at a minimal volume that only the keenest of listeners would be able to hear. Again, not a knock on Main's because they are clearly not a sports bar, but just some information for those hoping to catch a game here. 

It was karaoke night on the Sunday evening of our visit. The volume was good in that it wasn't so loud that it distracted from the game. 

Service was good - our waitress could be often seen walking by our area though we were in the back section that was otherwise empty. 

Seeing other reviews makes me really want to come back for the brunch. I hope I get the chance to in the future because my first experience here was quite pleasant."}
{"text":"Excellent weekend brunch location! I absolutely adore the amount of fresh fruits you get with every meal. I've been here in the summer and winter and seems like the seasons don't stop the fruits from getting to the customer. It's admirable considering most brunch places only offer an orange segment, a few cantaloupe/honey dew slices. This place is the real deal. The pancakes are nice and fluffy, while the French toast is a little more like dense toast (not soaked enough in batter). I think it's crazy that they use freshly cracked eggs in the scramble as well, other places opt for carton eggs. 

We got seated in the sunroom section which has a beautiful view of Main Street and lots of natural lighting. Whereas the inside of the pub has a more dim lit scene. 

Highly recommend this joint for brunch in Markham!"}
{"text":"Breakfast of champions anyone? This is the go to place for amazing, hearty, fulfilling diner style breakfast platters. Only available on weekends and holidays. Their regular menu is nothing special. Their breakfast platters are done right, and paired with a selection of 10+ fruit varieties. Everything you can ask for, for an All-Day Breakfast platter. The price is very cheap too. Best value I have seen in Ontario for breakfast. You have to visit them once for breakfast, if you're a breakfast person."}
{"text":"I love having so many options of places to eat on Main Street Markham. One of our fav places to go to for dine in or take out is Main's Mansion. They have a large menu with so many different options. 2 levels inside with an upstairs lounge and dining on the 1st floor. Their patio in the Summer  is a great place to relax with some lunch or dinner and drink while checking out the live bands. DJ, live entertainment, karaoke etc. - Main's has it all and they are open until 2am!

It is one of 2 places on Main Street Markham that i can take my kids too because they have menu options that my kids actually like (tenders, fries, burgers etc).  Sunday brunch is a must to try out! They have a great menu and generous portions of breakfast items served with a mountain of fresh fruit.

Some of our fav items are their burgers, sandwiches & chicken wings - and of course brunch!

I will add some pics after my next visit. :o)"}
{"text":"Service very pleasant, cocktails yummy, booze selection a bit sparse, food variety awesome.  I had the jambalaya, which was quite snappy. Partner has anus steak special - said it was very good. Looked like it was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I live very close to this place, and last Saturday afternoon I walked up there and sat at the bar and ordered a large Stella. In 2 years I've never been in there. After receiving my beer I immediately got attacked by fruit flies. I thought it was because the windows and doors were open but they were coming from a glass shelf right beside me behind the bar. I knocked the shelf and a poof of bugs came out.
I think the place needs a good scrubbing at least in the bar area. I found it dark and rank. I wonder how clean the kitchen is."}
{"text":"Seems like a big local hangout on weekdays.  Bartender seemed put out by serving a late night patron even though she had a dozen friends in the place. Small bar and $6.50 pint. Meh.  Downtown prices."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: quite crowded for lunch, a place to grab quick food

Food: 
1. Cheese spaghetti bolognese: 2/5, nothing special, sauce wasn't that flavourful 
2. Hai nam chicken: 2/5, the rice was a bit too moisted, chicken had lots of fat  
Price: 6.00-8.00 for lunch special, included soup and a drink

Overall: nothing really stood out, prices were cheap, burned myself a few times with the hot spaghetti plate"}
{"text":"I really like the ambience and the service. The food had a very nice presentation and very generous portions too. I had the eggs Florentine and really like the assortment of fruit it comes with. 

However, as nice as the presentation was, some fruits were a bit difficult to eat with fork and knives or even just hands. Most still had the peel on: I don't mind the apples or nectarines but kiwis, persimmons etc are a different case. 

In terms of the eggs Florentine, the poached eggs were good but it was loaded with too much spinach which overwhelmed the palate. The hollandaise sauce was very thin/runny that I could barely taste it. 

My bf had the meat lovers omlette which was overcooked."}
{"text":"Where to get brunch in Markham that's not dim sum? Main's Mansion lays out a nice brunch. And a summer Saturday or Sunday on the patio can't be beat. 

Main's serves up a brunch right. Gilead Cafe needs to take a lesson. Eggs benny for the price of eggy benny at Gilead Cafe but you get home fries and an embarrassingly large side of fruit. 

Service is great and parking along Main street (not to be confused with the Unionville Main street) is free."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast many times. They make pretty good breakfast or brunch. The prices are a bit steep, and it isn't much different from a lot of other breakfast places, but they give you tons of fruits, similar to Coras. Unfortunately, there is not a great breakfast place in Markham, so it is hard to find a go to place to eat. I think people view breakfast poorly around here, so it is difficult to find. Main's mansion does a pretty good job.

The sun room is nice in those winter months."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch one Sunday, we arrived around 10:00, place was busy but not packed so we were able to get a seat outside. There were lot of options on the menu but we settled for steak and eggs and french toast with bacon. Our server was very attentive, making sure our coffees were topped up while waiting for our order, which took quite a while but it was worth the wait. They have huge servings and I can't be happier. My expectation was just like any other breakfast, but this was quite a surprise. Bacon was crispy and not overly salty, french toast was good, eggs were perfect just how I like it, and tons of fruits - grapefruit, strawberries, blackberries, banana, orange, mandarins,pineapple, cantaloupes, honeydew, kiwi and grapes. But what stood out was the homefries. I am not a big fan of fries, almost always that's what's left on my plate after, but this time I finished everything. The home fries was flavourful and wasn't oily. And did I mention coffee was good that I had 4 cups? Well, I  am surprised there were no reservations needed for weekend brunch, as this place really knows how to deliver. Great food and service, what else can one ask for?"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Assortment of fruit is plentiful. I typically can't eat it all and save them to make a smoothie at home."}
{"text":"We originally did not know that Main's Mansion served brunches on weekends.  We intended to go to Liberty next door for lunch one Saturday, but it was not open yet.  We thought we could get a hamburger at Main's Mansion, so we went in.  We were given a brunch menu full of pretty pictures and well priced breakfast items.  Wow, this was unexpected from a pub, we thought.  

We ordered an Egg Benediction ($24) to share, and we loved this dish.  Main's Mansion makes 3 types of benedicts: regular ($15), New Orleans ($20), and Florence ($15).  A usual order of egg benedict includes 2 benedicts.  Egg Benediction has each of all 3 types, so though pricey, it is a bigger order and is intended to be shared.  The whole dish was nicely presented: the benedicts looked decadent, and the fruit was large quantity, well arranged and very colourful (see picture).  The 3 benedicts were very delicious.  The fruits were surprisingly fresh and sweet.  My favourites were the Florence and regular benedicts.  Yeah, Egg Benediction is expensive, but the cost is bearable when the dish is shared.

Please note that bottomless coffee costs $3 a cup.  You may want to get at least 1 refill.

I recommend Main's Mansion's weekend brunch.  Overall, 4 stars for brunch."}
{"text":"This gem is tucked away on Main St. I have visited twice for brunch on the weekend and I have to say the experience was fantastic. First, I'm not sure if this place is known for its brunch service but both times I have not had to wait for a table, which is a huge bonus for me.  There is nothing worse than a 30 minute wait for a table at a trendy brunch place when you're hangry. Main's is a pub, so expect pub style seating and pub decor however, for brunch service, the atmosphere is rather quaint and cozy.  I've ordered the omelette on both occasions and it was delicious, served with a huge serving of fruit, toast, and hash browns. Our server was attentive in filling up our waters and coffee throughout our meal. It's a place where I feel comfortable chatting with a friend for a couple of hours over brunch. We don't feel guilty for holding up our table (because there isn't a long line up for a table) and the servers are good about refilling our drinks without being intrusive or trying to clear our table. This place is great for brunch but selfishly, I kind of hope it stays relatively under the radar so I can continue not having to wait in line for brunch in the future :)"}
{"text":"On a whim, decided to try Main's for dinner on Saturday night.  It was a beautiful evening and we were hoping to get a seat on the patio.  We arrive and are told to select a seat if available on the patio - we find one and sit, awaiting someone to come and offer menus, the ability to order drinks.
Ten minutes goes by and nothing.  There are quite a few wait staff milling about and we have to flag someone down.. She asked if we were ready for our bill.  Um, no, we just arrived and haven't received menus... 

We order.... I get the buffalo chicken wrap/fries and my husband ordered another of the chicken wraps and a soup and requests no bacon to be included.  

Food takes ages to arrive.  In the meantime, there is entertainment  - this great little band that was lively and played a variety of music.  Still...we're hungry and are wondering why almost 30 mins has elapsed since we ordered.  Food finally arrives and husbands wrap has bacon.  Its not even so easy as to remove it ourselves as its chopped into the filling.  Ask for that to be remade and in the meantime.

My wrap was 'ok'. Nothing special.  The fries were a sad story.  It was a plateful of the remnants.  All the little 'hardened shards' of fries from the bottom of the fry basket.  Shameful that they would even serve that to a customer.  Husbands wrap was ok...nothing special.

Took forever to pay as the waitress is more interested in flirting with a table of guys despite facing us for ten minutes while talking to them and seeing us sort of looking over for her to come by.

In this area there doesn't seem to be many casual sit-down type restos and that's likely the only reason people end up here.  Save your money and time."}
{"text":"Great for brunch! I've been here a few times for brunch and have always had a positive experience. They have a great patio on the beautiful main street Markham. 

The selection is fairly comprehensive and the food comes in generous portions! I've had the various Eggs Benny's which are my favourite! Service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my daddy-daughter date here last week, very much so. 

Came by for a $5 pint, a pound of medium wings and a California naked burger. All were delicious. The patty had yummy seasoning and the guac was pretty decent. The Caesar salad was creamy and potent in garlic - just the way I like it. Our server was polite and competent. 

If I'm ever in the area, I'd return fo sho. I really like that there was a fireplace and a book shelf of dusty classics."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find a good brunch place uptown, but I think I have found the one.
Tucked away on Main St. in Markham is Main's Mansion serving brunch on weekends only from 9am-3pm. 

We ordered the eggs benedict and 3 eggs breakfast and although the prices are a bit high (~$13-15 average), the portions are huge! Each of our meals came with a wide selection of fruits including dragonfruit, raspberries, blueberries and watermelons just to name a few. We could barely finish our meal!

Service was excellent and the waitress came by a couple times to see how we were doing. 

Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast and brunch (much better than Cora's!) although I am only giving them 4 star because it is quite pricey. 

Added bonus: free wifi!"}
{"text":"Pub style seating and atmosphere.
Came here with some co-workers. Waitress was nice, and attentative.
I ordered the blt with vegatable soup.
Soup was nice and hot! Blt was pretty good!
Washrooms are clean and stocked up. A bit cold though.

Good place to go with loud friends for drinks and pretty good food!

I enjoyed my first visit.
4 - 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Today is the second time we came here for brunch. We arrived around 10 and it was quiet. We chose a nice table by the window inside. There are a lot of good choices on the menu. My wife and I ordered the western omelette and the blueberry pancakes (we decided to share). They were nice big portions with a big variety of fruit. Everything was delicious and we were full by the end. Price was comparable to other breakfast places. Will go again. Only negative point is the fact that the washrooms are in the basement, so not accessible to all. 
4.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"Awesome dining experience!  Sunday brunch was deliciously fresh & filling!  Huge servings for our orders...tons of fruits variety!!  Love the relaxed atmosphere.  Coffee super strong...a bit too strong for my liking. Definitely happy & will returning soon!!"}
{"text":"Very cute interior and exterior design, I like the concept of a mansion come restaurant. It was quite empty Sunday for brunch but hey that makes for a very attentive server so no complaints.

The good
-Awesome food! Seriously exceeded my expectations, the chef can cook alright!
- Huge portions...yummy!!
- Impressive brunch menu, more impressive than designated breakfast spots (ie. Cora's)and comes with a fruit salad.
-Great prices!

The bad
- Service could be better, waitress was less and less attentive and engaged in a conversation with friends at the bar.
- Could use some updating to make space more esthetically pleasing and spruce up a bit.

Overall I will definitely be back, amazing food and I'd love to try the lunch and dinner menu. This may become my go to brunch spot in markham!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely 4.5 stars!  What a great place for brunch.  Thanks to my friend for recommending this place.   We came this morning around 10am and noticed everyone was seated in the patio area.  I'm not usually a patio person but it wasn't very sunny or breezy so it was actually a perfect morning to eat outside.

The staff was excellent serving us quickly with our drinks, taking our orders and refilling our coffee.  The selections for brunch was amazing which included your traditional breakfast eggs and choice of ham, sausage or bacon, eggs benedict and waffles!  We ordered a dish from each of these selections which were all delicious.  We really liked how there were lots of fruits on each dish.  We were extremely satisfied and full.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friend was actually the one who took me here claiming that i would fall in love with it and leave Cora's in the dust. Oh man, she was so right about that! 

Main's Mansion is tucked in on Main Street, so if you don't know about it, chances are you'll probably write it off as some other bar.

My friends and I went for Brunch and ordered the French Connection and Egg's Benediction. There were 3 of us, and wow! There was SO much food! The portion sizes are ridiculously huge and the price was a bit more expensive than Cora's, but trust me, it's worth it!

The fruit is so fresh and takes up about 1/4 of the plate. So after we finished our variations of Egg's Benedict (original, smoked salmon and spinach), we all had to have some fruit! 

Oh man, the hollandaise sauce is to die for! We actually ended up ordering a side of it for our homemade fries because it was THAT good! 

I was definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants some epic portions and amazing Egg's Benedict :)"}
{"text":"I came here for a client lunch. There were a lot of restaurants along Main Street however my client chose Main's Mansion since he's a regular here. We got there and the place was empty. We got a seat instead but there was windows overlooking outside. I ordered the Thai chicken salad my client and colleague ordered the chicken quesadilla and vegetables burger with fries.  They both said their lunch taste fine. My salad was essential chicken stir fry in a sauce added on top of a bed of lettuce.  Since the stir fry was so hot it wilted the salad and there was so much sauce it drowned my salad.   I didn't not enjoy my food at all. I definitely would not come back.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"Had the good fortune to sit and eat a meal with my teenaged daughter, who wanted to try a new place for breakfast.  We thought Main's Mansion looked charming and loved the Yelp pics showing a plate full of fresh fruit along side the bacon/eggs. 

A+ for the service and atmosphere - it's quaint. 
F for the food though 

The watermelon had soured and tainted the taste of surrounding fruit.  The sausages are short and fat, and have an unpleasant taste, as did the bacon.   
The fountain Coke was watery, and the apple juice tasted like mold. 

The server was kind enough to exchange the Coke for an apple juice, but didn't offer any apology for the soured fruit. It was obvious to the eye the melon had turned. 

Main's Mansion is old and has a damp odor inside, but it's very charming and I would go back to try something on the dinner menu this summer and enjoy their huge patio seating area.

Not what we expected food-wise, but the charm and servers helped improve our time there."}
{"text":"So there is a lot of stuff that isn't four star about this place (ie: stains on my teacup, super globby sticky maple syrup jar that barely opened, emptly creamers in the creamer dish, some with dried mystery red stuff on them, old scratched up utensils....) but if you keep in mind that this place is a pub that happens to serve breakfast, and you're ok with a few gross-ish but typical pub qualities, you will be happy with your decision to brunch here.

Kind of a greasy spoon type meal, it's a great place to go to when you're craving a hearty brunch. Portions are HUGE, and prices fair. I get the regular breakfast (about $10) and it comes with three eggs, toast (rye, dark rye, ww or white), TWO kinds of meat (bacon, sausage or ham), delicious potatoes and HUGE serving of fruit. Not just the regular cantaloupe slice with a rotting sour pineapple slice and a strawberry. A huge amazing selection of fresh sweet fruit, raspberries, kiwi, banana, honeydew, grapes, grapefruit.... my favourite part of the meal. I can never finish and eating just half the plate would be more than enough. 

Service is decent. Nothing outstanding, but after all, it is a pub. Not a posh restaurant. They are kind and laid back. Will gladly fix any issues and always cheery. 

4 stars cus food is really really good, and great value. One of my regular brunch spots."}
{"text":"Maybe I should have came here for Brunch instead for Late Night.

Main's Mansion for sure was hopping with action on a Saturday Night. There were in fact 2 Live Bands in the house, one on the patio and one upstairs. 

It is great to see all these action up in Markham. But I guess I should have went somewhere else to catch the last period of NHL Playoff game. Main's Mansion turned to a club like vibe that night.

The setup was a little awkward as people walking passed the main dining/bar area to go upstairs, to go out to the patio, to go in and out and everywhere. It was good for people watching but not for game watching.

The only saving grace is they do have Hoegarden on tap so I don't need to be stuck drinking Canadian..

I might go back to Main's Mansion for their brunch but definitely not for a night cap. Just not my scene!"}
{"text":"Really good brunch spot on Main Street Markham! The portions are very large and they give a really good variety of fruit- much more than Cora's. The prices are a bit steep though. I ordered the breakfast that comes with a side of pancakes, and added chocolate chips to my pancakes at no extra cost!"}
{"text":"I have visited mains mansion a number of times for breakfast or brunch. That's what this review is going to talk about, the brunch.

The inside is decorated like an Irish -ish pub. Hardwood floors, stain glass windows, bar, etc. You can definitely tell (and sometimes smell) that it is probably mostly a pub at night. Seating inside consists of low tables and chares or high tables with high seats, there may be a banquet but I have seen it. There's also a huge patio to sit at in the summer. Its never really been that busy when we've come, bit we tend to go a bit earlier. It's usually when we are ready to leave that's when it starts to fill in more.

It's located on main Street Markham, not main Street unionville. There's some on street parking, and parking on the side, and back of the building. So basically no parking stress. Right on!!  Don't try and bus it unless you like to walk, there's a bus that runs up the street but its pretty rare. So you have to walk up hill from highway 7 or downhill from 16th avenue. I'm pretty lazy so no walking :)

I have only come with girlfriends for brunch usually before heading off to paint lounge or the farmers market.

With one exception the brunch is great. I prefer coming here than going to Cora's. Cost seems to go from a yogurt parfait for 12.99 (its huge) to an eggs Benedict platter for 24.99. My favourites are the classic breakfasts. Three eggs, toast ( regular or French), and a platter of fruits. Yum!. The yogurt parfait is also huge. For sure shareable. Breakfast sandwiches are really great too.

Only thing we didn't like, the waffle. It's the same price as the classic and sandwich breakfasts. You get one dense, bad tasting waffle, a blop of whipped cream, and a couple of pieces of fruit. Not the best. The one thing I had that I did not like.

Service is spotty. It's never been what anyone would call good. Usually the wait staff is just standing around talking about the night before or what's up that night, or gossip about someone that works there. Usually you have to ask for coffee refills and bills. It seems like its because we are usually a table of women. We have noted that tables with men get more attention. I guess they are hedging their bets that flirting will get them bigger tips?

All in all great place for breakfast, waffles excepted :)"}
