{"text":"So delighted to discover that the dosas are just as delicious as their original location, and that they take reservations at this Raj Palace! I am guaranteed to return, & will probably convince my partner to get take out here, as he works nearby twice a week.   Interior is larger than their original location, but not huge. It is nothing fancy, but is new, bright and clean. Menu is pretty much standard, but with some ice cream desserts and gluten free cake added.   My Mysore masala dosa was yummy - nice and spicy as I like it. (Pro tip - most traditional South East Indian cuisine is spicy, especially when it is described as spicy. If you don't like spice, don't order the items marked spicy) I did feel it could have been a bit hotter, temperature-wise, and the middle of the dosa was just a touch soggy, enough to knock it down half a star. I will be happy to revise the score if that turns out to be a fluke.   My one disappointment is that the entrance is not really accessible - I am not sure how you would get a standard sized wheelchair through the tight turns at the door. In addition, the sidewalk outside was a slick sheet of ice, and I saw no evidence that the restaurant or mall management had tried to do anything about it. I know it is winter in Calgary, but it is not that hard to throw down some gravel at least."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so this 5 star review may be a bit premature, but I plan on visiting whenever I get a chance so I can always update Yelp if required :)  This is South Indian style food, and that means they have dosas. You MUST try the dosas! We had two vegetarian versions - the spicy veggie dosa and the spinach dosa. Both were excellent - the crepe was neither too crispy nor too soggy, & the basic potato filling was just right. When I have had dosas elsewhere, I usually leave some of the crepe ends unfinished, as I don't want to overstuff my stomach, but here I could not stop eating it - tried twice & finally had to toss my napkin on the plate & push it away, as the dosa was so yummy I lost my self-control.   One downside - the place is very small, so you likely 1) need reservations, 2) need to go at 2 pm as we did, or 3) should just get take out. I am not sure how they package the dosas for takeout, though - they are pretty long & droop off the plate as it is.  Place is very small & unpretentiously furnished; our well-scarred table was clean but would probably not impress some folks. Both washrooms are accessible which is a nice bonus for a small establishment.   Damn, I have made myself hungry thinking about that dosa..."}
{"text":"Good food - was exactly what I was looking for! We had the chicken vindaloo and Kadai Lamb."}
{"text":"I'm indian so my review may be considered biased towards good tasting food, not food of a culture I don't know and think tastes great.  Two dishes were tried: fire chicken and garlic naan. Fire chicken isn't something to review, since it could be any type of food smothered in chilli powder and chilli seeds.  The meat should have been marinated so the flavors absorbed into it.  The dish was bloody hot, and lived up to it's name. My stomach started hurting after a few hours from the chilli.  The garlic naan wasn't much to desire, it was better described as  lots of raw garlic with a light coating of naan type breading, instead of naan with garlic in it.  Overall the dining experience was ok, personally I wouldn't rush back, other than to try the Dossa dish (probably the chicken dossa)."}
{"text":"Raj Palace serves up an unlikely combo of cuisines: south Indian and Hakka (Indian-style Chinese). We ordered some south Indian first: gobi 65 and some dosas. Great stuff! Loved the spicy gobi. The dosa fillings were a little bland (the potato masala was almost like a potato salad), but the dosa itself was pefect, and the sambar and coconut chutney were on point.  Next we ordered an item from the specials board, chili paneer (in the style of Hakka chili chicken). This was amazing! Not greasy, but with a clean chili flavour. I would come back just for this dish. Too bad Raj Palace is so far from downtown."}
{"text":"I go there whenever I am craving Dosa - very, very authentic and GOOD. The \"sides\" mainly sambhar could definitely use some improvement - very bland. Filter coffee also is as authentic as you can get in Calgary. Definitely worth a trip for south indian food."}
{"text":"Raj Palace was one of my favourite hangouts for South Indian Food. However today's experience was totally negative.  There was just one hostess serving during the service who rudely informed us that multiple menu items are not available ( No sorry, No apologies). We enquired about a beer to drink and again a very unapologetic rude reply that they were only carrying X, y and Z..  Food took 40 minutes to arrive when the order was a Idly sambhar and 1 uttapam !!!!  Looks like the change in staff / management hit this place negatively..,, unlikely to return for a dine in.. Will try a take out maybe.."}
{"text":"Hmmm well this is a mixed review food wise the dosas are delicious. The tandoori lamb and chilli beef not so much the meat tastes old. The middle aged gentleman shouldn't be in the service industry. He's pretty unpleasant. The younger man was lovely and so helpful and kind. Big point to those who are celiac. They advertise gluten free but they don't use separate cooking pans or have the ability to wash or wipe them down in between. For that reason in and of itself we won't be able to go back."}
{"text":"Yum-o!  Visited for a weekend lunch recently. We were the only people in the restaurant when we first arrived, but as we dined a few more tables came in too.  The restaurant itself is pretty small (definitely not for large groups!) so \"a few more tables\" actually left the restaurant pretty full.  Raj Palace serves up South Indian food, like I used to binge on at the buffet at Southern Spice and Mysore Palace.  But with no buffet in sight, I am limited to ordering appropriate quantities of food (and thus feeling less like a blimp as I leave the restaurant).  The menu features lots of vegetarian and non-vegetarian choices, including a few dishes that start with the word \"fire\"- \"fire vegetables\", \"fire chicken\", etc... finishing one of these spicy dishes supposedly gets your name on a wall of fame, though I didn't see anything like a wall of fame in the restaurant- perhaps nobody has ever finished it?    My friend and I shared a couple of dishes for a light lunch.  We went with a palak paneer dosa and vegetable korma on basmati rice.  I couldn't resist a mango lassi, and she wanted even more carbs so she got some extra naan.  It took about thirty minutes for our food to arrive, which was fine as it was obviously made fresh to order, and from the freshest ingredients.  As we were waiting we were given a complimentary basket of what I think were lentil crisps- feather-light \"chips\" with a mild flavour.  Our food, upon arrival, was perfect.  The dosa was larger than my pregnant friend's as-yet-unborn baby will likely be, and it was full of creamy spinach and homemade paneer.  The korma was unlike any I've had before (I've been missing out)- full of not only vegetables but fresh fruit like apples, pineapple and grapes, all in a creamy cashew sauce.  Creamy cashew-covered grapes popping in your mouth?  To die for!    For great south Indian food, for Indian takeout fanatics, for dosa addicts, for people who like fruit in their savoury dishes, for budget diners... Raj Palace in the northeast would be a great stop.  I will definitely be going back to sample many more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Glad to see that one can get decent, authentic South Indian food in Calgary. The other places that used to serve this cuisine went down the drain a while ago. Between two of us, we had dosas, vada and idly......staple South Indian food. All good. Would be nice(r) if the sambar was piping hot! Would certainly recommend, and visit again."}
{"text":"Good variety of dishes, food tastes great , just a bit pricey ( i would say abt $1-$3 more on popular dishes than average Indian places) ... but very clean and nice place, and attentive service... highly recommended that you go in a bigger group to try different dishes"}
{"text":"I love this place! We finally found an Indian food restaurant that we love everything. The butter chicken is almost all chicken. Most restaurants have a couple pieces and just all sauce. The Coconut Prawn Curry is thick and flavorful! The Paneer Pakora's are to die for with the Tamarind Chutney that accompanies it!  We tried the Dosa and I was pleasantly surprised. A little hard to eat the stuffed ones but they're really yummy!  The services is great too! The staff is friendly and acknowledge you as soon as you enter. Food comes out pretty quick and is probably the best I've had in Calgary so far!  You do have to pack up your own food at the table, but I prefer it!"}
{"text":"Super delicious!!! Will definitely be back!  Ordered the veg pakoras, butter chicken, paneer butter masala, basmati rice,  butter and garlic naan and masala dosa. All were amazing.   Cozy atmosphere and friendly owners. Great portion sizes and fair prices!  Came here on a whim and we're so glad we tried it out!"}
{"text":"Overall good experience good ambiance, good south Indian food. Look forward going back to try out some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"After experiencing the downtown location a few months back (it was terrible), I decided to go to the one near my house in the north. This time it was much better! It is a small place, but seems to be quite busy.   I got the Fire Chicken, which comes with a pretty good warning about how spicy it is going to be. For those of you hot food challenge people, mark this one on your map. It was great. Not many places make truly spicy food, so I am always glad to find one to match my extreme tastes.   They do have much milder fare such as the dosas which is a south Indian specialty. I got a side of coconut rice, which wasn't as fragrant and flavorful as some places I eat, but still good.   I will definitely be coning back, maybe for some take out on a lazy day at home. I'll be updating this review after I do so."}
{"text":"No comments needed. Great Indian food, great customer service. Decent ambiance (pls use better Indian music) overall very good visit. I can usually handle spices but the food was EXTRA spicy even tho I only wanted medium hot so I had to keep adding yogurt to the dish which ruined the overall taste for me. Pls dial down on the spices."}
{"text":"We have been in this restaurant 3 times. First time my wife had ordered a Mango Lassi and they served the Lassi which probably was made with terrible yogurt which was smelling. When she complained to the manager he replaced it with a freshly made one. The second we were there the food was flat and tasteless. the third time (August 23rd) we wanted to try Dosa (which is supposed to be there signature dish). First they served us Vada which was under-cooked and we couldn't eat it and the manager took it back. Then they served us Dosa and potato stuffing was cold (like just taken out of refrigerator) and it tasted sour like it was rotten. When we called the manager again he apologized but never made any attempt to change it. Though i must way he charged us for only one dosa. Hate this place - will never go back again - they serve rotten food. Maybe I should send an email to the Food Inspectors."}
{"text":"Very friendly ppl. W ordered chicken lam n goat curry. Gotta say that d lamb curry outshines all d other ones. I hav no idea wat magic they put in their cooking. So  i think i found my go to curry place now."}
{"text":"Foods decent but the customer service is terrible. Called in and ordered takeout, came in a 1/2 hour later to find out that they lost my order. After re ordering and waiting for an hour in there restaurant,  i asked a waiter how much longer till my food was ready, I was rudely shushed by the waiter. If i wasn't so hungry and didn't already waste an hour and a half at this place i would of left. Decent food, but the poor customer service is not worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome menu!!! A lot of variety, reasonable prices, fresh spices and a lot of flavour!!!"}
{"text":"A little birdie told me they finally have lunch options. When I say \"little birdie\" I mean a friend who knows I love Indian food.  I always eat lunch on the go so thought I would give them another chance since there food was really good.  So glad I did. Love when I can update a Yelp review from 3 to 5 stars.  They now have great lunch options and all includes Nan too! Yippee. Ordered the Beef Vindaloo to go. Paid and waited. It only took 10 minutes and is $12.95 + tax. Reasonable for lunch.  When I finally did eat  it, I was impressed with how much food did come for a lunch special. Do see my pic of \"Lunch take-out\" I only ate half,  but great thing, I have left overs.  The beef vindaloo was beyond great. Tender pieces of meat in a great sauce. Spicy, the way I like it. YUM!  It also came with a container of rice which was delicious. The piece of Nan was large and sooooooo good. A very hardy lunch option and great price too.  The lady that served me was so friendly and made sure to staple my to go bag so it stayed warm since she knew I wasn't having it right away. She also included a menu and said to come back for more options at dinner. Very kind and sweet lady.  Glad I came back to try again and so happy that you have lunch options now. Will be back again for my Indian fix!!! It was really good. Thank you.    ***************************************************************************************  Needed lunch since I was on the go and required take out. I Thought I would finally stop in since I was craving Indian food.   The restaurant is decorated nice and there was only one couple inside having lunch. So it wasn't busy. Not sure if it's like this all the time or just this particular day?  They don't have a lunch menu or any type of combo meals where you can pick a few things to have for lunch. They also don't have a buffet or to-go buffet. A bit disappointing for lunch.  I asked if it was possible to pick a few things to make a lunch combo and was told they could only do full orders. Long story short, I ordered some rice and butter chicken since I didn't have much choice since one entree didn't cut it. Nor did I want to spend a small fortune ordering a few things for lunch. $25+ later for lunch to go wasn't ideal.  Pros:The food was delicious, the lady at the counter was friendly and the restaurant is nicely decorated.  Cons: No lunch menu, no buffet and no flexibility on creating a to go lunch. They really need more options. I understand this is a new location but surely isn't a new business.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I wish i could give negative stars!  Aint biased for or against any restaurant, and try to give as genuine feedback as possible.  Food tastes were extremely average. The sambhar and coconut chutney were below average. (the side that goes with dosa) Paper dosa was extremely oily, oil was dripping! It was horrible! Chicken side dish was satisfactory. Quantity of coconut chutney given was too scarce. We had to repeatedly ask them abt it. They behaved as if we r hungry homeless people! Hate the service! Cutleries and glasses were very unclean. Even the replaced ones were equally unclean.  Service was slow. Interiors are nice. This is far from being an authentic south indian restaurant. Il hope that they shut down soon and stop misguiding serious food connoisseurs."}
{"text":"My lovely lovely mum ordered food from here and got it delivered to our place as a surprise for our anniversary.   What made it even better was that the food was the BOMB!   I had never heard of this place before, and I was not expecting South Indian when the delivery came. I have had South Indian food several times in the past and I really like it - the flavours are distinctive and they dont shy away from spice. This place was AMAZING south indian!  We had the chicken chettinadu, buna gosht, and a whole fish pomphret. Everything was SPECTACULAR. I dont say this lightly. Each dish was superbly prepared and the flavours were authentic and just straight up awesome.  Only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I havent been to the physical location itself. But no worries - I will be heading there ASAP!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best tasting Indian meals that I have had. The lamb kadai, Nan, and flavorful rice were top notch. Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Delicious. I tried this place five days ago and tonight is the third time eating it. The fire chicken or fire lamb is sooooo spicy. Literally spiciest food I've ever had and I have gotten it all three times because it's great. The goat vindaloo is also amazing and I've ordered it twice. Garlic nan bread is a must try, but the butter nan is good too. The food is timed well as I've only done take out."}
{"text":"I was on a flight back to Calgary months ago when a very nice Indian woman seated next to me and I got to talking. We were discussing food, one of my fave subjects and I had asked her where she liked to eat in town. She mentioned the \"Palace\" in Country Hills so we assume she was talking about this one! Besides her own cooking she explained that this really was the real deal for curries and anything Indian for your taste buds. In we went on a Friday night and we got a table no problem at 6pm. There are no more than 8 tables here and it did get busier. The server mentioned that on a busy night with milder temperatures they get lined up out the door and I believe it. The service, we would give it a 4. The woman was all by herself and hopping. I would have loved to have received more info on the dishes but no time for small talk or smiles! It was all business which is to be respected and our water glasses never did go empty. The food was 5 star quality. We had a lamb curry - deep, rich and great depth of flavor with big chunks of meat. We also had a chicken curry which I asked for it to be extra, extra spicy. I even eyeballed the Fire Chicken on the menu which is said to be right under ghost pepper hotness and if you finish that dish, you get your mug up on the wall of photos of people that ate it all! I am glad I didn't order that as my chicken had just the right amount of heat. Very good curry, large portions (we could have shared one - next time we will do that and try an appy) Basmati rice can be ordered as well which we did and of course we went for the garlic Naan bread, also fresh and piping hot. YUMMY! The dishes are said to be cooked to order so they ask that you give them 30 minutes to make your meal. What is better on a cold winter's night than a hot bowl of fresh curry? Nothing! We got a take out menu for next time and discounts apply for orders more then $40. We were the only non-Indian people in this restaurant and I think that speaks for itself - AUTHENTIC SOUTH INDIAN!"}
{"text":"In a few words, delicious, fantastic service, great food.   I would like to commend this restaurant for its excellent indian food. I was extremely impressed with the level of service and found the food great tasting and plentiful.  We had ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo, Mysore Masala Dosa, Chicken Dum Biryani and Garlic Naan. What a feast.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Vindaloo were fantastic. Both had a delicious sauce that was easily a take home item afterwards to be mixed with my own rice. They were rich in flavour and the meat was tender and full of flavour.  The Garlic Naan was the best that I've ever had. Some other places I've been to simply use garlic butter on their naan, however here there was a nice spread of finely minced garlic all over the naan. It was delicious and definitely gave me the garlic breath that I was hoping for after eating a few. It was a perfect compliment to the chicken tikka masala and the lamb vindaloo.  The Chicken Dum Biryani was excellent. It was my first time ever trying this dish and I highly recommend it. It comes out as a bowl of deliciously spiced rice and buried within it are a couple drumsticks and thighs. It was superb and the blend of spices were intoxicating.  The Mysore Masala Dosa was like a potatoe pancake. Well, at least that is how I related to it. It was delicious and piping hot when it arrived at our table. I highly recommend this dish as it too was my first time trying it and I loved it.   The customer service was great and I could only assume that it was the owner who was serving us. Each dish was explained as it arrived and when asking for recommendations they were very knowledgeable.   Check this place out the next time you're in the Country Hills area. They are definitely worth the stop and their prices are fair. Good job folks!"}
{"text":"Best southindian food In town . But don't get fooled  into dosa stuff. Their biryani, lamb sukka and pepper chicken is to die for. The best dish is their pomfret tandoori. Only place in town u will get it. Would compete with any restaurant in india. Well done !"}
{"text":"It's overdue that I re-do my review of the Raj Palaces here in the city. At last count, there are three, one down south in Midlake Plaza in Midnapore district, two up north in Harvest Hills near Beddington Trail and the other near 112 Ave. NW in Royal Oak.  We followed the best chef around from 112th to Harvest Hills, but now he has apparently returned to India and has given up his post to a new cook.  Where does that leave us? Where he worked no longer is 5 stars. The two Raj Palaces in the north are good but very much not the same as when he worked at them (we have been to both in the past month). That little Tamil chef had what we call 'the touch.' Not only did his Indian food taste wonderful, he injected into the flavours of his meats, breads and sauces his special touch: we returned so many times to enjoy his exemplary tandoori chicken tikka, pomfret fish, and Chettinad curries: all exemplary! So good were the latter that I researched chicken chettinad curries online and now make my own multi-spiced chicken curry at home. Very good too was his garlic naan and dosas. Now all changed, just not at the same level at all. The Raj Palace in the south was also good, but so inundated with MSG that, oddly, my wife and I got up in the evening and night several times to drink copious amounts of water to slake an unusual thirst.   What is a best solution to the vacuum left by this little chef?  Go to Mehtab in Cochrane and ask for the full flavours in their vindaloos, curries and other tandoori dishes. Experiment by staying away from all Canadian versions of 'butter chicken,' and 'test eat' everything else. Ask Jab Thind the head server who is possibly family to the owner to 'turn you on' with their best, and experience what happens to your taste buds. It is right up there with what Raj used to be under the care of our great Tamil chef.  We are so sorry he has left, but ratings are subject to what go to expensive restaurants for, great food."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Amazing food, so so yummy. Good service, had to ask for additional napkins. Our server was only a few days in the country and he was friendly and easy to understand.  The place was clean, bathrooms clean.  The food was so good, definately coming back and will recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"Wow! I thought I wouldn't find better Indian food. Then we ordered delivery from this place. It's soooo flavourful and yummy."}
{"text":"Sooo goooood. Best Indian in the city that I've ever had, plus decent portions and appropriately priced. They seemed a little overwhelmed in the dining room, but I always order take out and I always get what I order, and it's always ready when they say it will be. Phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Service was good but make sure they understand what you need. The mysore Masada dosa was way too spicy. Be ready to drink a jug of water."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend birthday dinner. We came on a Sunday at 5:30 and we were the only ones there. Within 30 minutes the place was full. The owners were friendly and attentive. The place is a bit dated and small.   The food was really good. If you like spice then this is the place to eat. We ordered the cauliflower, beef dosa, potato dosa, butter chicken, rice and garlic nana bread and they all were so good. The portion size is huge and we definitely over ordered for three girls.  Every dish was well seasoned and flavourful. The beef dosa was wrapped in a crape like pancake perfect for soaking up all the sauces. Overall it was really good authentic Indian food and if it wasn't so far from where I lived I would be a regular."}
{"text":"I have been to this place few times. Its a nice south Indian restaurant. Nicely decorated and very clean place. Staff are very friendly and never have to wait in the door cause they acknowledge their customers right away.  Good for family dine out. We always try their Masala Dosa which is the best. You can choose to have spicy but it already has good spices in it so we never add it. I have also tried their Kotthu Roti and so far the best one yet. I would recommend this place for any Dosa lovers."}
{"text":"So far, best curry I've had in YYC! Ordered the Fire Chicken and it lives up to its scorching name! Not only fiery but delicious and full of flavour! One sad thing is my wife's order was incorrect. She ordered a vegetarian dish and received a chicken curry. Other than that, great food!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer for raj palace at country hills. Every time I order, there would be something wrong with the food. Last time I ordered, the butter chicken seemed very stale, old, and overstored. This has been the third time they messed up the food and would be the last time I order from them."}
{"text":"The man who greeted us made it feel like we just walked in to our Indian home. He helped us select what to eat from the menu and he even gave my lady a drink on the house so she could cheers me. The food was fantastic and very genuine. Loved it, I definitely recommend it. And it's warm inside"}
{"text":"Had good food a few times, then ordered a chicken vindaloo that tasted off. It had the texture of eating subway chicken.  It was obviously different from my wife's butter chicken meat.  I called in and as a courtesy mentioned about it.  They told me they would replace it, but I explained it was too far and we already ate.   The person on the phone said to mention it next time and they would comp it.  I did eventually call back a month later too see if maybe they could redeem themselves, but as expected, they didn't. It's a shame, as I likely shouldn't have wasted my time to even give them the feedback after our previous order.  After the false promise and wasted time, I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth. We'll be ordering elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Really good food. Stopped here on the way to the airport for lunch and ordered the lunch special and tiffins. Portions are big and food is delicious. The place is clean and the service is really good. Reasonably priced as well. Would definitely stop here again if back in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great new find!  Small, quaint, great Southern Indian cuisine! The Dosas were wonderful...a stand-out amongst the sea of many indian restaurants in the city..."}
{"text":"We have a diet restriction within my family - no sodium or very, very low sodium.  We asked if the restaurant could prepare us some dishes.  He said mostly vegetarian dishes and the Fish Amritsari that he could prepare without added salt.  Oh my!  The 3 dishes we ordered were so tasty.  The Fish Amritsari was so tasty as well as the Okra Masala and Chana Masala.  The mix of spices the chef uses to prepare the dishes makes my mouth water!  Will be back for more.  Thanks, Raj Palace!"}
{"text":"Raj Palace is located in a quiet and clean strip mall. It has ample parking space available and as you walk in you are greeted by nice modern well lit ambience and nice dining setup. Soothing South Indian music which I actually don't understand, is being played inside. On my short Calgary trip this was one of my south india brunch stop. They have a variety of Indian dishes to chose from both veggies and meats. Since I love South Indian food to start my day with, I ordered the combo which got me Idli, vada, dosa and coffee which I replaced with masala tea. Idli were soft, nicely done and amazing in taste. Vada was outstanding with the flavors of all spices and lentils making their presence felt. Dosa was big for my brunch appetite but was done to perfection and the sambhar it was served with carried the flavors too authentic. Two chutneys the coconut and the other made from a veggie I forget with hint of garlic were complimenting the dishes. Masala tea completed my brunch. Nice place to start day with."}
{"text":"I was out for a drive on this side of town and I see Raj Palace. South-Indian food you say. Food, you say. I'm in.   Just having finished a big green smoothie, I'm filled to the brim. But this is South-Indian food we're talking about. Home food. There's a hidden compartment in my stomach that opens up for South-Indian food.   I proceeded to try the following.   - Chicken Vepuda (Chef's Speciality) - OMG. Tender, succulent cubes of chicken infused with southern spices.... sprinkled with cashews and Southern magic. I asked for an additional 2 orders to be packed. Perfect combination of textures - soft and juiciness of the chicken and the crunchiness of the cashews. Flavor.... words cannot describe the happiness my taste buds were experiencing.   And I wasn't even hungry. Just curious. Unfortunately, that's all I could eat at the time. I'm definitely heading back to work my way through their menu.   Service is polite, efficient and informative.   Excellent first impression. Respect."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great food!! The dosa it is amazing ...definitely coming here again!"}
{"text":"I just moved into Beddington and I'm a little scared as to my proximity of my wallet to Raj Palace!  As a celiac there is nothing in this world better than being able to eat a giant gluten free crepe filled with deliciousness! If you're in to spicy the Mysore Masala Dosa is to die for!"}
{"text":"I've now had a chance to try several other items at this resto and have yet to be disappointed. It's my go take out place but I have eaten in house once. I really enjoy the paratha, have tried a fried fish and a saucy fish, two kinds of lamb and a chefs signature chicken item. I still love my daal/ the yellow lentils but have tried all lentil dishes, the palak paneer and chicken korma. I'll slowly make my way around the menu. Looking to try the eggplant dish next time! Great job and so glad you moved into our neighbourhood!  The portions are a good size and we usually get 2-3 meals from it for 2 people. I love the blend of spices and the heat factor but it's personal preference as I like a spicier heat. Some Indian restos water down the flavours but this place hits the spot for me!"}
{"text":"Every time we come back into town on a flight, we try to hit up this location. It's basically on the way for us.   It's small, but relatively clean. The menu is great, the staff is pretty friendly.   The last couple of times it was packed.   I can really only recommend the vegetarian things on the menu, but they are all served pretty quickly, taste fresh and are hot and spicy.   Naan is fabulous, pakoras are great...this location is FAR better than the buffet on 6th ave SW.....Bartha is heavenly, paneer is great...nothing but good things to say. The price isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Raj Palace is a rarity in Calgary. It is South Indian and provides some distinct dining experiences. Try the dosa, it is a rice and lentil crepe that comes with different choices of stuffings. Besides the two Raj Palace locations, I haven't been able to find it elsewhere...yet.   It is a small venue, so make reservations or get takeout. On weekdays you may get lucky if you get there a tad early."}
{"text":"Ordered four different dishes, and thoroughly enjoyed every one of them. Butter chicken was the group's favourite :)  Great service and generous portions."}
{"text":"This Raj Palace is even better than the one in Royal Oak.  The chef and staff was very accommodating to my family member who cannot eat a lot of salt/sodium.  I phoned ahead to see if the restaurant can make dishes with no salt and the restauarant said they could!    Off we went to Raj Palace last night!  We ordered the following with NO SALT:  Onion Bhaji - Like Onion Rings, only BETTER, especially with no salt.  Comes with 2 dipping sauces: tamarind and mint chutneys.  The dipping sauces had salt in them and we made sure that our family member who has the salt restriction diet did not eat those dipping sauces.  Bhindi do pyaaz  - \"Okra dices tossed in abundant onions mildly spiced\" - Exactly as the description from the menu said!  It was delicious and even better still...no salt!!  Coconut Prawn Curry - \"Deveined tiger prawns cooked in a mild fresh coconut sauce\" - Most delicious prawn curry...Also cooked with no salt.    White Basmati Rice  I am always amazed at how Indian chefs can cook with no salt and still produce a very good flabvour.  My family member is still raving today at how wonderful that okra and prawn curry was last night!!  :o)  The rest of the family ordered dosas:  Butter Chicken Dosa - Most well received!  It was so yummy.  Tender pieces of butter chicken and that gravy - to die for!   Raj Club Dosa - Cheese, egg,fresh chopped onion, tomato, coriander and chilli - Oh my!  This is, by far, the best dosa I've ever eaten!  That pop of green chili lit me on fire!  LOL  It was so good!  There were 3 dipping sauces that came with the dosas and every morsel was scooped by and smeared on the dosas!  They were tomato, coconut and sambar (lentil).    Dessert:  Had to order Gulab Jamun - those beautiful honey balls!  Absolutely NO salt whatsoever!    Definitely coming back to Raj Palace in Harvest Hills!  This is the best Raj Palace by far!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the food was good, what we got of it that is. Taste of India or anywhere else charges the same but better portions usually have left overs but not from this place. Wasn't worth the money"}
{"text":"Best Indian I've had in Calgary. Great Butter Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo. Lovely little place! Next time I'll get my vindaloo a little spicier- it comes on the mild side."}
