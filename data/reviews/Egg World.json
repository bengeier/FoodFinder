{"text":"Still on the search for the best breakfast place; I can't say this place is the one but I can say that I came hungry and went home satisfied. 

My bf and I ordered the create your own omelet. I got mushrooms, olives, and cheddar cheese on my omelet and it was very satisfying. The omelet comes with your choice of bread and choice of potatoes. I suggest the house potatoes because they are seasoned to perfection. As for the prices it was reasonable, but the orange juice is pricey for it not being large. $3.50 for fresh squeezed orange juice seems way too much! 

I would most likely come back here and try some of the crepes since they looked so yummy."}
{"text":"Egg Works..Egg and I, Cracked Egg, and now Egg World. I went  there thinking it was the same thing as the before mentioned breakfast restaurants but I was surprised to find out that they were in no way associated with one another. And to no surprise it was apparent that Egg World doesn't live up to the others. Bottom line, keep driving down to the real Egg and I on Sahara."}
{"text":"had sunday breakfast.  waited quite a while to place our order and the place was not at full capacity.  other tables were getting their orders taken faster due to the server.  they said they are not part of egg works or egg and I which i find amazing, that there is absoltuely no afilliation at all?  hard to believ ethat one  wait time for eggs and pancakes 24 minutes .  nothing special in the environment, the service, the quality or the pricing."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!!! There is nothing like a perfect breakfast, Great Coffee and tons of tv's showing football on a Sat or Sun.

It's been our weekend hangout since we moved here and the service is completely wonderful and entertaining.

They have dishes for everyone from standard egg dishes, crepes, pancakes, griddles and skillets. Even the pickiest person would have a hard time not finding something totally mouth watering on the menu!!!

See ya Sat!!!"}
{"text":"On point.

That makes 3 stellar experiences and 1 \"what was that all about?\" The later aside, you truly are a chorizo scramble Godsend, Egg World. And your crepes are overflowing with delicious berry nectar.

In addition to my comments from before, I'd like to mention how comfortable their space foam booths are."}
{"text":"Cold food cold service.  Go to Egg and I instead. They can't even be bothered to actually spread your butter on your toast before serving it! Cold eggs cold hollandaise sauce on your Benedict.Total waste of good money!!!! I've eaten here at least 4 rimes thinking that it might get better after opening. Guess not!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Egg World.....

Will be our last visit to Egg World.

Came in today (Sunday) around 11:45.....restaurant mostly empty, maybe 10 tables had customers....

We waited about 15 minutes to be seated......(I'll be with you right away) that was repeated a few times.....

15 minutes later, we are seated.

The toaster is broken.....(they only have one toaster in an Egg place??)

Lots of complaining by other customers....

Our breakfast/brunch finally served at 12:30......

Both of us ordered Eggs Florentine....

I will report on mine....

One egg.....RAW...barley cooked....(did not eat it)
2nd egg, over cooked, on the hard boiled side....
English muffin.....raw.....because the toaster was broken....

I didn't order the potatoes....I had fruit...that was fresh....
My husband had the potatoes....said Denny's would be better....
We don't like Denny's by the way.

Service??
What service??

(two guys who should have been in the kitchen, were out watching the game on the TV)

Husband orders coffee.....server, walks past him to give coffee to the people behind him....

So, no.....have no desire to try it again....sorry Egg World.....

Oh, wait another 20 minutes to get our check....our server was chatting with two women, who sent their pancakes back, because they were raw inside!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed at all. The servers are helpful. But the freshly squeezed juices are horrible. If your going to charge me $4 it better taste freshly squeezed, hand picked, and good. As far as the crepes I wasn't too impressed. The omelets were dry. Plus the food was pricey. I don't mind paying more for good food but this place just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday for breakfast. I knew that since this place is still new that it wouldn't be as busy as most breakfast places in town. I was right.. there was only one other couple in there when we got in which was nice. The decor is tastefully done I just didn't like when they turned on the overhead fans because things were blowing off the table a bit. 

I was going to just order crepes but my husband suggested I do that as a side order because he wanted some too. We decided on their Sundae Crepes it had banana, and strawberries in them. Those were huge especially if I compare them to IHOP crepes. I'm not one to complain though...the more crepe the better! They were really good too! 

I had an Omelet that had tomatoes, bacon, cheese, and topped with avocado. It was good but it was missing something so I asked for some sour cream on the side. ..perfect! It also came with a side of potatoes which reminded me of the ones at the Cracked egg. They were just as delicious!

My husband had the Denver Omelet with a side of hash browns. Judging from the empty plate he liked it ! His only complaint was that the coffee tasted funny...I tasted it just to check. It did have a weird after taste to it. 

I liked this place especially because they offer crepes. I think they are pretty good competition for the other breakfast houses in town!"}
{"text":"Two words, slow and gross. 

Our waitress did not seem new since she knew regulars, but she moved so slowly I wondered if it was her first day. I ordered a simple biscuit and gravy plate, something Vegas seems to do very well. It was literally disgusting. Both the biscuit and the gravy were entirely too sweet, prompting me to put my fork down after only 2 bites. When my dining companion tried my food, he had the same reaction. 

The fresh squeezed juice, although overpriced, was very tasty."}
{"text":"I always get the spinach omelette with house potatoes.  The portions are generous - way too much food for me, especially early in the morning.  I do finish all the potatoes though - the house potatoes are the bomb.

I wish they would offer some pancake combos, because the pancakes are pretty good.  Breakfast here usually comes out to about $15 per person for some reason, so a little on the high side."}
