{"text":"The pizza is amazing, the hoagies are on fresh bread and are on point! The owner is first class too! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Hoagies are fire the company I used to work for would order 100$ worth of food every Friday we loved it"}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza which was about $13, and were surprised at how small it was when we picked it up. It was a 10 cut, although it was more like an 8 cut with two tiny extra pieces. Way overpriced and service wasn't great. I only gave them 2 stars because the pizza itself was pretty good."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. The BBQ chicken pizza will delight anyone that has an inner 5yr old. They put hoagies together that create flavor explosions, and I can't even explain how crazy good their bacon cheese fries are.  The staff is friendly it's one of Aspinwall's best kept secrets."}
{"text":"An extra large pizza was so small it barely fed my wife and I. Also the pizza was bad."}
{"text":"Good pizza /nice guys. Great little neighborhood pizza place. We had The Godfather pizza and it was supper good. Fresh ingredients and good crust! Yummy"}
{"text":"I have tried the PGH legends Aiello's and Mineo's and they are both very good, but not the best. Casa is. That being said, I have to say pizza is the one area of food that people seem to disagree on most. Nowhere else will you find a bunch 5's mixed in with some 1's from the same place.  All I can say is it is definitely worth trying at least once. The menu is much more extensive than impression you get from the sign when you first walk in, so ask to see a menu. They have sandwiches and specialty pizzas, but I have yet to get past the pizza.
It is strictly take out. Also 1st Street is a one way street.  On Freeport, go north at the light at Brilliant, go 2 blocks, and then left/west on 1st."}
{"text":"I can't imagine anyone liking this super bland cardboard!  I just don't get how anyone could like it?  No taste at all.  We got two pizzas.  One with pepperoni and one with sausage.  Both had no flavor and the crust was chewy and lousy.  No sauce much and cheap cheese.  How a place like this stays in business is beyond me, but only in Pittsburgh I guess.  If you like pizza worse than what you got at a school, I guess this place could be good in your eyes."}
{"text":"Small pizza shop in Aspinwall. We love their specialty pizzas, especially the Hawaiian and Calabrese. The subs and salads are large and always delicious. Everyone is so friendly. I could eat here once a week, if only my husband let me!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Casa Del Sole Pizza tonight. Ordered two extra large pizza (one pepperoni and one green pepper & onion). Although not the best pizza I ever tasted, it also wasn't the worse either. I don't know if I would recommend this place, but I would eat it for free if offered."}
{"text":"Yes, they deliver, and love movies, Pittsburgh sports, and local artists.  \"Casa\" is a tiny neighborhood pizza shop located near the firehall.  I worked there in 1996 and possibly a few other years off and on.  My third pizza cook job, it was owned by Bobby Cozza who raised 4 daughters and little Luigi off the profits.  Founded in 1978, when Bobby quit the plumbing business (though he continued to do a little plumbing work here and there for years after) eventually he and his business partner went separate ways.  Bobby ran the shop through the 90s and finally he retired and sold it to the current owners, the Lombardi family.  

Bobby, whose family hailed from Calabria, made a signature Calabrese white pizza, which is still offered there today: olive oil, spinach, feta and artichoke.

Casa's new owners were loyal to Bobby's vision and experience.  They used chefs at the neighboring tavern who dissected and then managed to recreate Bobby's unique take on classic Italian Dressing, which has impressed my friends as far away as the Big Apple.  Stop in and ask to take home a bottle!"}
{"text":"I wasn't moved by my pizza. It was gluten free and \"organic\", but something was missing. I would return out of curiosity. I can't say that I'd brag about this place yet. 

The customer service was good though. 

It was a whole in the wall, yet you could tell that a lot of love was put into their brand. We shall try again."}
{"text":"This place is gold. I'm a big, big fan of contributing to the Yelp community, but I'll be honest, Casa del Sole almost gave me a reason to hold back - im too worried that lots of awesome reviews will make it hard to get a scrumptious pizza of theirs on those Friday nights where it's the only thing you really want.

This is a tiny operation, tucked off the beaten path - its carry out or delivery for the most part, although in the Summer, they do seem to have a table or two set outside for you to plop down and ravage your pizza if you just can't make it home in time. The owners are super friendly, and very efficient. Once, there was a mixup with my order, and they threw in a side of fried zucchini on the house - good move. Now, we also get that every time we order a pizza; it's extremely addictive!

Do yourself a favor and try them out - it's great to support a local business, especially when these guys do such an amazing job at hooking you up with great comfort food!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in the North Hills.  Casa Del Sol has been a go to pizza place for Aspinwall, Fox Chapel, Blawnox, and Sharpsburg for decades!  

It would be awesome if they offered walk in pizza slices for lunch."}
{"text":"Growing up in Aspinwall, I've long been a fan of Casa Del Sole. The pizzas - regular and specialty - are always loaded with toppings and piping hot. My favorites at Casa are the steak sub and the meatball sub. Both the pizza crust and hoagie bun bread is delicious. The prices are great and food comes out fast. I would take Casa Del Sole over Vocelli's or another chain any day!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area- hands down! Try the Calabrese pizza and some pepperoni poppers! Everything is fresh every time. Tried a newer place in the area because they claimed they had the best pizza ever- no they don't. Casa does."}
