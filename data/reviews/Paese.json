{"text":"Relatively new to the King West theatre district, and across the street from the Bell Lightbox is, Paese.  New to the neighbourhood, but not new to the restaurant scene, Paese has been operating out of their Bathurst street location since 1989.  Serving up Italian comfort food in a casual but sleek atmosphere, Paese might give longtime district resident Kit Kat some competition.

With a monochromatic colour scheme, butcher block tables and exposed brick, Paese is very welcoming, even for someone who happened to be dining alone (see: yours truly).

My server brought the customary bread to the table...but this was no ordinary bread and oil. The bread itself was warm and chewy with a pretzel like flavour.  It came with an olive, rosemary and thyme tapenade that was rich and salty.  I tried to stop after one slice, but failed miserably.  I managed to leave one out of the four slices on the plate but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't staring at it longingly throughout dinner.

Next, came my Beet Caprese Salad ($13).  Grilled beets came topped with a generous portion of mozzarella di bufala, drizzled with pistachio pesto and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds.  The combination of flavours and textures worked well together, and it was just a very fresh salad overall. If seasons were characterized by salads this one would be spring.  It was filling enough to be my main course, but I wasn't done yet.

As full of bread and beets as I was, I couldn't wait for my cavatelli ($13).  Hand rolled and made with semolina it had a texture similar to gnocchi but it wasn't as filling.  The sauce was reminiscent of my grandmothers, and that's a compliment as although she wasn't Italian, she was married to one and had learned a thing or two over the years.

I had initially sent away the wine menu, although I'm not sure why exactly.  Maybe it was an unexpected burst of responsibility on my part as it was a weekday afternoon and I had another review to do...but those are hardly excuses not to partake.  It's part of the job after all.  Either way, one of the resident sommeliers saw right through me and insisted on returning the wine menu to my table.  Smart man.

Paese has an extensive wine list and while most can only be purchased by the bottle, they do have a comprehensive list that is sold by the glass.  Now I'm no expert on wine, but I do drink a lot of the stuff so I know what I like, and I like Amarone.  I was given a sample of a 2004 Fumanelli Amarone before committing to a full glass, after which I gave the go ahead for my server to fill 'er up.  Rich and full-bodied it was a great complement to my meal, but as far as I'm concerned it would be a great complement to anything...cheese, pasta, breakfast...

Because of its location, I probably won't make a repeat visit but I don't think Paese is having a hard time attracting other customers.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good and affordable meal with some vino before or after catching a show."}
{"text":"Not worth the money. While the atmosphere and service is excellent, the food is nothing special. We had a pasta and the whole grilled fish that others recommended on this site, and weren't impressed with either. For a $40 dish, I want to love it. Neither my wife or I could finish the fish ...too dry and \"fishy\" tasting.
We won't go back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great new restaurant on the King street W strip. My friends and I eat out a lot. This restaurant covers all of our requirements. The ambiance is elegant yet comfortable. The service is inviting and efficient. The food is un-complicated and perfectly cooked. I loved my octopus appetizer, we also shared a few bar snacks that were extremely creative, they were all spins on traditional comfort foods, with an italian twist.... Try the gnocchi poutine - yum! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that I didn't have a bad experience At Paese.The waitress was nice and sort of funny, and the atmosphere was.. well, it was fine. 

But besides the service, the Nutella dessert, the Cappuccino and the free bread, I didn't think there was anything spectacular about the restaurant. We started off with the Mushroom Bruschetta, which tasted overwhelmingly like Balsamic Vinegar, moved onto the Main Course- some chickpea pasta thing that was drowned in oil and had no taste unless you ate it with the sundried tomatos- , which there were not enough of, and the Funghi Pizza, which tasted like Mushrooms and a little Cheese dumped on some dough-- and if the menu didn't say there was Truffle Oil on it, you would have never known.

The portions are ridiculously small, and when you're done with the Main Course, you're still hungry, so they're pretty much forcing you to get dessert.

The price was WAY too expensive for the type or amount of food. If I have to pay $100, the food should at least be better than whatever I can make at home.

All in all, it was fine the first time, but you probably won't see me walking in there again."}
{"text":"A gem! Such a cute little place. Good was amazing and service was impeccable.

Sal is so great! Had an amazing girls night out here. Definitely coming back! See you soon Sal!"}
{"text":"Nice, intimate restaurant. Kind waitstaff. Delicious meal.

Steak and Poutine - steak was excellent, loved the gnocchi on top. BBQ/tomato sauce was a bit strange but wasn't bad. Probably would ask for the meal without it

Veal Scaloppini - also excellent, veal was moist and flavorful. The sauce was a bit too lemony.

Would definitely return. Used a groupon without any issues."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Paese for years. The food is consistently great and the staff is very nice. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice, they did a good job renovating from the old Bistro 333.
I was seated and had water to start. He automatically gave me bottled water as I was waiting for my friend whereas the party beside me automatically got regular water. This rubbed me the wrong way...whatever.  We ordered sparkling water afterwards which is what I would have originally ordered. 

Anyway, I had the espresso & pepper crusted roasted quail to start. I love quail and this was pretty good but really, really, really peppery so there was bite to it though at times it was too much pepper.  I didn't taste the espresso.
I opted for the lamp striploin with a chick pea mash, salsa verde and tomato jam. The lamb wasn't gamey so it was done well. Of the rest of the items that came with the dish, only the tomato jam was really good though I can't say that it was a jam except more like roasted baby tomatoes.
I ended it with Cioccolato. A dark chocolate terrine with white chocolate mousse and Nutella sauce. It also had candied nuts on top which were actually my favourite part of the dish. The cake itself was moist and soft but with the mousse and all that sauce it became mushy. 

Walking away though, I thought everything was okay. Service was okay, food was okay and atmosphere was okay (though probably one of the nicer places in that strip of restaurants)."}
{"text":"I choose this restaurant based on reviews from other Yelpers. The other reason was it was a stones throw from the princess of Wales theatre and we had tickets for an afternoon musical. 
The restaurant has a warm trendy atmosphere and we were greeted right away when we arrived. Service was fantastic. She was very attentive and knowledgeable with wines and meal selections. 
We were indecisive about our wines so the server allowed us to taste two different wines so we could make our decision. She also let us know they only have a corkage fee on Saturdays
For the appetizer we had palanta fries. I didn't mind it but my bf didn't care for it. Although he did compliment the presentation. 
Main course: he had veal scaloppini, I ordered the lamb shank. Both meals were enjoyable. 
I had mentioned it was his birthday and she waited until he left the table to ask what kind of cake he would prefer. We decided on the chocolate cake with Nutella which was not bad at all
Overall we had a fantastic evening. We dont have anything negative to say but we were not wowed with the food either."}
{"text":"It's ok. There are better. But if you're in the area, you're hungry, and don't want to travel too another place, this will suffice. 

Service is sporadic. One waiter was exceptionally friendly, the other 2 seemed to be grumpy and did't put on their service smile face (even the fake smile was absent).  This could have been me going on their bad day. I'll let you be the judge whether that's excusable. 

Pizza was a tad on the oily side. The pizza was on the proper firmness, but the dough texture didn't make this a 10/10. The dough was a 4/5 for me. Considering the garnishing, cheese, and firmness of the overall product, it's a marginal pass of 6/10. 

I'm tough and picky, but then again, they do specialize in pizza, and they're about $20 a piece!"}
{"text":"My Mom and I were looking for a quick drink and a snack before we headed to see \"Rock of Ages\".
The usual King St jungle was happening, with people tempting you into their restaurants with bites of yummy goodness.
We happened upon Paese, which looked like they were just opening their doors...for the first time ever. No one was inside and we thought that we'd give it a shot.
We sat at the bar and each ordered a \"Venetian Kiss\", which was some Prosecco, strawberry puree and Cassis. Sounds yummy...non?
We also ordered the mushroom bruscetta.

The puree and the Cassis sat at the bottom of the glass...looking like...well...barf.  The bruscetta was cold...like really cold and the bread was soggy from some mayo concoction.

The wait staff was busy talking about their break...although we were the only people in there.

I would try again, just because it might have been opening night jitters...but I am not rushing back."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and drive past Paese all the time, and have always wanted to go-- but was a bit worried after reading the reviews here. I am So glad we checked it out, despite the picky ness of others!!

We went on a very busy Friday nite, made a reservations and at first we were seated by the front door, not a great location especially when we did make a reservations.  We requested to be seated somewhere warmer, and the hostess seated us in a booth at the back.  Very Cozy!

The waiter was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menus and wine and extremely attentive during the evening, so i am really not sure what all the fuss was about with other reviews?? Maybe they are just crazy?? 

A warm rosemary bread basket and luscious lemon hummus was brought to out table to start. A nice touch...

We ordered a pizza to start as an appetizer to share. We had the Affumicata di Bufala pizza-- VERY yummy and the crust was thin as pizza should be. 

For the main dishes we ordered the Pasta--Linguini di Pesce, Goat Cheese and Leek Ravioli and the Paese Special Lamb Chop dinner. Our meals were amazing! The Linguini had 2 giant shrimps and a scallop. Very fresh and sweet......

The lamb chop was incredible and if they had this on the main menu we would be at Paese all the time!

The evening was wonderful and Paese you did not disappoint! Looking forward to another great evening soon!"}
{"text":"We used a teambuy voucher that allowed $50 worth of food and ordered the daily bread (banana bread, beignet, ciabatta w/ nutella), veal panino, funghi pizza and pistachio + brown butter cake. The descriptions on the menu are quite appealing, but ultimately, I was disappointed by the flavours of the dishes. The complementary focaccia was so dry, I'm not sure why they bothered to serve it. It was clear that they had left it out in the open since the morning (we were there at ~ 1:40 pm). The daily bread basket wasn't any better; the banana bread tasted nothing like bananas, the beignet was a dry ball of dough rolled in cinnamon and sugar, and the nutella bread were two pieces of burnt ciabatta smothered with a layer of nutella in the middle. We sent that back because the burnt taste was so strong and were given two new pieces that were not as burnt, but still had burnt edges. 

The pizza was the only good thing we had; the crust was great and you really can't go wrong with white truffle oil...except over oiling it I suppose since it was quite a greasy pizza. Good flavours though. The panino was nothing what we expected. The grilled bread was soaked in a layer of oil, veal was tasteless and the sauce in between was super bland. We used the hot sauces they provided to boost up the flavour. Ultimately, that sandwich wasn't finished because it really was not good. That panino was calling for some cheese and it got absolutely none. 

We weren't too eager to pay $12 for dessert but we had room in our $50 budget. The cake is super tiny for the price and again suffered from being overly dry. I guess the mascarpone/whipped cream on the side helped it be more fluffy, but the cake itself should be a bit more moist. It gives me the impression that the food is not fresh as all since the bread was stale and the cake was made days ago. 

\"Inspired by Italy. Made in Toronto\"... I seriously don't think they have an idea of what good Italian food is. Food is not creative, the plates are overpriced and the dishes were bland. Very disappointed and will not return. Thank goodness for the teambuy voucher. I'd be quite upset if I had to pay full price for everything."}
{"text":"This is an attractive, contemporary and well designed restaurant with good food and a great location... BUT:

Sunday brunch turned into a 1h20m waiting game to be served. Order was taken in a timely fashion and it started to get quite busy just after noon. The place looked under staffed. Then 15 minutes passed before our server let us know that one of the orders didn't go through and asked us to repeat it. Another 20 minutes before he let us know they were out of the ingredients for one of our dishes. It was a further 15 minutes, having been offered nothing more than the starting bread and spread and our drinks, that the server said \"just a couple more minutes\", and when asked what went wrong, replied \"preparing egg dishes is tricky for so many people\". Twenty more minutes before we were offered glasses of Prosecco in apology. Another 10 minutes until we got to eat.

During this hassle, a group of 8 stormed out with fanfare, complaining about the same service we had been given, refusing to eat the late meals (or to pay).

Many were served normally, but some of us were not. They only removed a coffee from the bill, so I did not tip. The tasty food is not enough to make me return. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Went for dinner before seeing Les Mis. They were very mindful of the time and asked first thing if we were going to see a play. The wait staff was very friendly and did their best to make the dining experience enjoyable. I liked the ambiance and decor of the restaurant a lot, but there were a few things that displeased me. 

First off, ordered the green salad- which was supposed to have a lemon vinaigrette, however, fairly certain there was no dressing. I'm not one to complain, so didn't say anything. Steak poutine was interesting, a neat twist on the classic dish, after a while got a little too saucy. Spelt pasta with autumn vegetables, kind of missing vegetables, noticed a few carrot straws but that was basically it. Love goat cheese, but just a tad bit too much in the pasta for my liking. 

Finally, we were overcharged about $30 in alcohol- didn't realize this until after visa had gone through, and didn't want to be late for our show so didn't have time to argue about it. If we had known we were paying for an extra glass of wine and an extra ounce of alcohol we would have drank it! 

So all and all a mediocre dining experience, great ambiance, however being overcharged left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Excellent food, though a bit pricy for the neighborhood.  If you ask nicely, they'll seat you in a booth!  There's only one and it looks kind of sketchy because it's right near the entrance, but it's way more private than the tables in the other room."}
{"text":"We visited on a beautiful Friday evening in July, and sat in the outdoor patio.  

The service was friendly and efficient and the drinks from the bar (a Mojito and a gin-and-tonic) really hit the spot.

Less successful were the pizzas and the mushroom bruschetta - much too oily.  Hopefully this was just an aberration."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a friend. Had an amazing meal- scramble eggs on toast. When first looking at the menu it didn't seem like anything too special, but once I got the meal I was very delighted. All the tastes blended so well on the plate, I still crave it... The coffee was pretty good too. We also ordered the chicken pizza- it was very well presented but seemed to have too much on it.. it seemed dried out and the flavors did not create anything special in my mouth... would have been satisfied with just the cheese pizza. But the flavors of my egg plate and coffee is what made an impression on me and would definitely come back here. We also enjoyed the music- very lounge-type selection."}
{"text":"I've been twice and here's what I've got to say: get the brussels sprouts. Don't ask why. Just get the brussels sprouts."}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful; the restaurant feels very cozy.  The volume in the restaurant is surprisingly low.  We were able to have a conversation without shouting at each other, which was very nice.

The food (polenta frites, stuffed olives, pasta with autumn vegetables, rapini) was very good, and the portions were decent sized.  

My main problem with this restaurant was the service.  We were greeted at the door by a very friendly staff member.  It went downhill from there.  Our waitress forgot to put in an order for our sides, so they arrived after dinner was finished.  This in itself wasn't a problem, but she did not come back to our table after our mains were served, and we were not able to point out the error until our food was almost finished.  After our sides arrived, she seemed to be avoiding our table.  We tried to get her attention repeatedly, without success.  We were unable to have coffee and dessert because she did not come back for almost half an hour, and we had show tickets.

The food was good, but I'm not sure that I would go back again.  It's not a cheap restaurant, and I would expect better service."}
{"text":"Neighborhood haunt - I've been many times over the years. Really great to have a really good Italian restaurant in North York....however, our most recent dinner (May 2015) was disappointing. The server was tired (burnt out) and a tad sarcastic ---yes he does know more than I do about the food so please do share in a nice tone. The food --well the place was busy (as usual) but I have to say, it wasn't very good. The octopus was served differently (not charred and colourful) but white and bland, the pasta was too al dente, the pizza good but very oily...my biggest thought after I left, driving home was...Longo's fresh upgraded take-home food bar (HMR) is at least equal to Paese in terms of quality...and much less expensive. But yes, I will give Paese one more try."}
{"text":"People really like this restaurant but I thought it was average. Okay service. Okay food. Great location to downtown attractions."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. You can't go wrong with this pick. Visited originally for Winterlicious years back, and have been coming back ever since. 

Their salads are delicious, soups are fantastic.. The pastas and pizzas cannot be beat and their meats are wonderful.

All of the desserts too are exquisite. This is one of the best choices for a night out or a special occasion in the area. Once you check this place out.. you'll be back for more.

The atmosphere is lovely and all of the staff are great. Good full bar, nice ambiance. 

Thumbs up - try it!"}
{"text":"Good wines by the glass but the portions are small and over-priced. We were very disappointed in the spaghetti and meatballs. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Calf's liver is my favourite dish from them. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came here for a work function. Very good since I got to taste most of the menu in one go!

The hummus was under favoured.

Deep fried pickle was good, juicy and had a meat ball inside 

The mushroom pizza was delicious

Polenta fries, good

The really good soup was a turnip soup, it was ok.

The steelhead trout was good, well cooked, not over cooked and the pesto accompanied it well"}
{"text":"The restaurant had a nice atmosphere. We started off with a nice glass of wine and they brought over some bread for the table. We ordered the Margherita pizza - Mozzarella,  fior di latte, basil and tomato sauce. The crust was very thin and crispy. Even though it is a simple pizza, it was very delicious. We were already half full from the pizza.

Now for the main course. I got the orecchiette with wild boar, sausage. My friend got the ravioli. They were both very very good. The pasta was fresh and chewy. The meats was very flavourful. I clean the plate very quickly. We both liked our pasta dishes a lot. Very satisfied tummies."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a few years.....and the experience was as enjoyable as i remember!  The staff are professional and have a great way of engaging guests.  The food was amazing.  I will not wait as so long again until my next vista."}
{"text":"Date night with a girlfriend and we decided to try out the Summerlicious menu. 

STARTERS
Meatballs
- Yummy!! 2 large meatballs in a light, not too tangy tomato sauce
Tomato and Crab Soup
- Also delicious and chilled, our server was polite and gave us the heads up that it would be cold as we ordered

MAIN
Grilled NY Striploin
- Striploin was delicious with the roasted pepper agro dolce, wasn't a big fan of the crispy polenta fries, I found it too dry for my liking
Lobster Saffron and Sweet Pea Risotto
- Full of flavour, decent portion

DESSERT
Sorbet Duo
- We both went for the sorbet, mmmmm!! I'm a fan of sorbets - I believe it was a raspberry sorbet with a pizzelle cookie, great way to finish off the meal

I've been to this restaurant a couple of times in the past and have always had a very nice experience. They have a no corkage-fee for the first bottle of wine which I really like to take advantage of! Will definitely return again! 

Cheers, 
- Trisha"}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviewers, I also tend to avoid this strip of \"theatre restaurants\" on King Street, but my girlfriend had a wagjag...and suggested we check it out for a girls night. I was pleasantly surprised.

First off, this is a great place to go for pizza. I had the \"Bianca Pizza\". It is a white pizza (no tomato sauce) served with potatoes, pancetta, roasted onions and smoked mozzarella. Extremely tasty stuff. The crust was crispy and perfect for dipping - which brings me to the dips. All pizzas are served with 3 jars of dip/toppings. I was a big fan of the spicy red pepper.

I'd recommend for dinner/drinks with the girls. And if I were going to the theatre, I'd suggest it over a lot of other options on that block. It's a bit too fancy & trendy for families."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant to go to pre-theatre.  My partner and I shared a salad, pizza, and pasta dish and it was plenty to eat.  The beet salad was the best I ever had.  Pizza was thin and crispy and the gnocchi was superb!  All this and two glasses of wine for $80.00.  Great value.  The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars was because of their music playlist."}
{"text":"Been here three times already and each time was just great. Food and service. Wine selection and prices too. And today the atmosphere was as great as any high end Newport beach restaurant."}
{"text":"Just happened to wander into this place. We were only looking for drinks so we sat at the bar. 

The drinks were delicious. The bartender that was currently working the bar was probably a novice but the drinks didn't disappoint. He crafted them well and he was friendly. 

We also had an appetizer (Polenta Fries). They were perfect for a light snack. 

Id definitely recommend this place for drinks. The appetizers were good and the food they were bringing out looked great as well."}

Extra information:

* Gluten free friendly & Vegan friendly
* Late night menu everyday
* Serves breakfast on weekends
* Open for lunch and dinner

Just last week I was invited to a 'Messy Meatball Monday' where they launched new late night meatball menu. It's been a while since I was out and about to a food scene so I thought it was a good opportunity to come back to it all.

The Duce

* Play on caesar made with San Marzano tomato sauce with meatball on top
* Who thought you can serve meatballs on top of a cocktail? brilliant idea by the Mixologist, Moses McIntee

Paese Meatballs

* House ground beef short rib, sirloin, brisket and pecorino, braised in tomato sugo
* Basic meatball that was very tender and perfectly seasoned

Veal Meatballs

* House ground veal, pork and ricotta with sweet peas, cipollini onions, braised in milk
* This was milder in taste and softer in texture

Chicken Wing Meatballs

* Spicy pepperoncini chicken meatballs with gorgonzola dipping sauce
* This is suppose to taste exactly like chicken wings
* I personally don't like blue cheese but the flavor wasn't strong
* One of my favorite out of all the meatballs

Pepperoni Arancini Balls

* House smoked mozarella, salsa verde and chili mayo
* Who doesn't like deep fried rice balls?
* This is suppose to taste like pepperoni pizza and it did!

Balls on Buns

* Smashed balls, tomato sugo, dill pickles, potato chips and provoline on brioche mini buns
* This was probably one of my least favorite
* I found it to be a little dry and hoped bread was softer kind 

Meatball Margherita

* Mozzarella, basil, tomato sauce and meatballs
* It was thin and crusty, I actually enjoyed this very much

I don't think I've ever consumed so many meatballs nor have I heard so many ball jokes during dinner. It was amazing to see so many different types of meatballs that Chef Palik came up with and I thought it was great that there are restaurants out there who are willing to do something different.

I really enjoyed trying out their new late night menu and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Although the service was excellent, the prices were very high for the quality of food we received. Portions were small and my fish was bland and not very tasty. It was surprising and disappointing."}
{"text":"We decided to check out Pease today for our date night. 

As the host's mentioned it was a hidden gem.

The place looks amazing, a great place for a romantic dinner and definitely amazing for date night with the wife.

The stuff are very friendly and were very accommodating with our requests regarding special drinks and food.

I got myself for starters Arugula Salad and my wife Polenta fries. The salad was very refreshing and perfect dish in my opinion before the main dish. The fries looked quite a small dish, but my wife loved it and said it was a good appetizers with perfect size.

For main dish we got Han and a trout. Both were a recommendation by the stuff. They were delicious and perfectly cooked.

And for deserts we finished it with a butterscotch pudding. It was just to die for! 

Highly recommended and definitely a place we will back to.

Thumbs up, thank you for making our date night perfect."}
{"text":"So sad to hear this place closed! This is my favourite Italian restaurant!
 Will definitely try to visit your location in the west end!"}
{"text":"Another tasty meal from Paese.
We both had specials tonight - I had the thick cut New York steak with red wine reduction, while my wife had the manicotti with fresh mushrooms.
Delicious! Steak was melt in your mouth at med-rare.  Coupled with a nice bottle of wine, heavenly!

Paese is always a nice casual dining experience."}
{"text":"Where has Paese been all these years and how have I never stumbled upon it? Came here for lunch with my manager one day. Loved it so much, brought my boyfriend in for dinner. Everything we had here was delicious. However, I'd highly recommend the Gallo pizza or the Mushroom and Spinach Garganelli. Both were made to perfection. Hats off to the chef (and the service)!

Side note: parking is a little bit of a hassle here. There's few in the front and really tight, claustrobia-induced spots in the back."}
{"text":"Picked it randomly for a drink with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. Amazing unpretentious not-in-your-face not-fake-intimate service.  We loved the funghi pizza. Packed room on a Wednesday night says a lot. I'll definitely be going there with friends again."}
{"text":"The food was really amazing, as was the service.  Given the size of the portions, it was a little pricey though.

I had the Ricotta Gnocchi (Roasted chicken, squash and mascarpone), and it was arguably the best thing that I've eaten all year.  Yup, I said it.  All Year!!!

The Roman Caesar salad was really quite bland, but nice (two of us had it and had the same opinion).

The wine list was extensive, and we chose a greeat bottle.  The Sommelier had all the attitude, knowledge, and circumstance that one should.

Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and knew the menu inside and out.

This is Definitely an exceptional restaurant.  I'll be back...."}
{"text":"Its been about 4 years since I've been here, our last visit was disappointing due to poor food and service, but I went last week for an office function.  Things are much improved, back to the days before the big reno.  Our server (Ken, iirc), was really great, very knowledgeable, not pushy.  The food was lovely, pear pizza was both dinner and dessert, the kale salad was tasty, however the grilled shrimp appetizer was a bit too grilled.  Portions were a good size, and their coffee is still excellent.  Their prices are more than I would pay for a regular night out, so I will never be a regular here, but its nice to see that they improved their game since I was there last."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6 pm, 2 tables had guests, the rest of the restaurant was empty. My mother asked for a table for two, she was told \"If you can't call ahead, you  shouldn't bother coming.\" Apparently they had many reservations for 8 o'clock and were not able to seat my mother and her husband, who arrived at 6pm. Regardless, this is not how you speak to patrons. Rude is the only way to describe the Hostess. Very upsetting experience for customers who in the past have held large parties here, will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"This should actually be 3.5 stars.

We had been to the King St location before and enjoyed it with a Groupon.  We bought another and used it for this Bathurst location, and it was a solid performer.  Bathurst has more families there than King does, and has a different menu to accommodate.  I think King is better than Bathurst though.

Dishes we enjoyed:
- grilled octopus
- leek & spinach ravioli
- butterscotch pudding

We'd eat here again if in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"*3.5/5

ROASTED SCALLOPS ($16) - Fennel and tarragon slaw, citrus and blood orange vinaigrette
The scallops were thick, juicy and fresh. However, I wish they roasted it a little more as I prefer the roast to be 1/3 into the scallop.

FUNGHI PIZZA ($16) - Roasted mushrooms, thyme, fontina and truffle oil
The truffle oil taste was quite strong. I kind of wish the dough was different - I felt it tasted like bread more than pizza dough.

BEED TENDERLOIN MEDALLION (Special) - Oven-roasted with Torchon de Foie Gras + Red Wine Jus
The steak came out medium as opposed to medium rare which I ordered. However, it was still very good - tender and juicy all throughout so I was still happy with it.

SEA BREAM ($33) - Grilled Whole Fish with Stuffed Thyme and Lemon
Though the skin looks a tad overgrilled, it was actually perfectly grilled - with crispy and flavourful skin.


CIOCCOLATO ($11) - Dark chocolate terrina with white chocolate mousse and nutella, hazelnut brittle
COLONIAL ($8) - Brandy at Khalua
One thing I was surprised is there was no tiramisu in the dessert menu.
I was glad the cake was moist and not too sweet. One thing I really loved about this dessert was the hazelnut brittle.


PARMIGIANO REGGIANO ($10) - Honey, rosemary roasted almonds, focaccia crips
The  flavour profile when mixing all 3 is very delicious.

SERVICE
When the mains arrived, my glass of water, the bottle of still water, and our cocktails glasses were all empty. However, none of the servers who checked back asked if we wanted more water, get refills on drinks or get another drink."}
{"text":"I'm a downtown girl, and maybe I have downtown expectations.  But I like good service, good ambiance, and good food, even if it's more north than I like to venture.

There's nothing WRONG with this restaurant. The pizza was quite good.  My drink was nice.  Our warm goat cheese salad wasn't warm, but did have nice, simple flavours.  I thought the polenta fries were good, but the serving size was off.  I hated the scallop dish, to me it had basically no flavour at all.

But something was always, as Yelp puts it, \"Meh, I've experienced better\".  We arrived and they didn't have our reservation, despite me calling two weeks prior.  They sat us right away, in a really shitty spot.  The server was a 'jokester', which I always dislike, who mostly made me feel uncomfortable.  And overall, I just didn't really love this place.  

We did have a $25 gift certificate, thankfully, but even then I found it overpriced for the quality.  However - having a dinner out with my sister - that I enjoyed!"}
{"text":"If you have good taste, you will not like this place. However, if you are the average citizen, you definitely might. The service was less than stellar (especially with out server). We were not appropriately greeted, checked on, etc. The food was subpar. The caesar salad had old lettuce, with pieces that were browning. My mom's shrimp linguini was sour. I could go on, but I will just finish this off by stating that I would not return."}
{"text":"I went to Paese Ristorante for Winterlicious. This place is small and romantic. I love the feel of this place. I ordered the shrimp salad, braised beef which tasted amazing with great red wine. The dessert was not so appetizing, the cheesecake was too goaty for me, the ice cream with biscuit tasted like medicine. I recommend just getting main course and skip the dessert. Otherwise a nice, friendly place to unwind with some girlfriends."}
{"text":"Typical restaurant-row place. Service was fairly attentive though a bit spotty, and server poured a different wine than what we had ordered without showing the bottle first. We were also assured the complimentary focaccia was in the oven and would be served shortly. 

The Roman Caesar salad I ordered was delicious. Good portion, interesting croutons, distinct anchovies and soft boiled egg assembled to perfection. My boyfriend's meatballs were \"flavourful, but too firm\" and \"had a nice sauce\". The prosciutto cotto on my pizza was bland, but the parmesan and arugula were satisfactory and the crust and sauce were great. I'd highly recommend going with another pizza - I don't understand why one would put prosciutto cotto on this type of pizza instead of just prosciutto, unless it was a one-way-ticket to flavour-town.

My boyfriend's Genova pizza was considerably better and he said he'd order it again.  Oh, and that focaccia arrived halfway through our main course. I tried it for the sake of trying it, and was pleasantly surprised with the white-bean hummus accompaniment. 

I feel like a restaurant in this part of the city, which likely caters to the pre-theatre  and post-Jays-game crowd should have tighter service and polished menu basics."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, a neighborhood gem!. We love the food, the atmosphere and the service. Had an amazing wintetlicious lunch here last week, menu was yummy! Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is a-ok.  I've heard so much about it and snapped up a wagjag when it was available.

Location is top notch of course, being on the theatre district King St W strip.  Decor and atmosphere suited the place too - dark and classy.

We had the grilled octopus (so-so, giant tentacles! The texture was kind of weird and didn't seem very fresh) and meat balls (I feel like I could make something like that at home...).  For the mains, I had 2 half portions of pasta.  It was nice that the half portion really is half of the full portion price, rather than being charged at a premium.  Definitely do the half portions if you want to try a selection of the menu.  The ravioli was OK - I felt it was a tiny bit under cooked though.  The tuna pasta with broccoli wasn't all that bad.  Hubby had the rib eye steak which he found a little dry.  Our other dining companions had a whole grilled fish which she said was delicious, as well as 2 other half portions of pasta which apparently were both better selections than what I had.

Le sigh.  I was hoping that this place would be better than what it was.  The highlight of the meal for me really was the companionship as well as their house Pinot Grigio.  A very sweet, refreshing start to the evening!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my mom's birthday. What a hidden gem this is! The food and service were out of this world. As an Italian, I can vouch for the food. It is delicious and very authentic, with generous portions as well. You have to try their desserts as well. I had one of the best tiramisu slices here. Our waitress was very attentive and had a tonne of energy and character, and she really made our night. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food but pricy. My girlfriend and I had the grilled octopus and special pumpkin soup to start and pastas for the main course. The food tasted great, especially the grilled octopus. The soup was a bit salty but still really good. Environment was nice and the waiter was really friendly. 

The only thing that kinda brought it down for me was the price. The portion were quite small and yet it was really expensive. The sparkling water itself was 6 dollars! Total for 2 appetizers and 2 \"full size\" (not really) was 74 dollars not including tips. I went there on a voucher and even with the voucher I still had to shell out 25 dollars + tip at the end. Total dinner including the voucher price is about 60 dollars including taxes and tips. Overall, it was great to visit once, but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a saturday night. It was packed and we got seated in a tiny table in the middle of the busy dining are which is half an arms length away from the next table. A little privacy would've been nice... Food was good had the gallo pizza and the saffron papardelle. Although the chicken on the pizza 
was alittle dry it was still delicious as it wasnt too oily. Loved their homemade bread dipped in hummus... Wine selection was average, alittle pricy for a serving, no pop refills. I wouldnt have minded it at all if the service staff was more attentive. We were basically left hunting our waitress down the whole time.

Long story short... good food, lacking quality ingredients and could use better pricing and service. oh! and beautiful clean interiors"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a fantastic dinner on a Travelzoo coupon . The Rosemary focaccia with white bean and fennel was a great start. Gnocchi with macaroons, orichetti with tomato sauce, smoked skirt steak, Ontario perch, too much to remember and it was all fabulous!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised...I'm not a big fan of Italian food, but we were running late before going to a show so instead of going to the restaurant that we had planned on going to, we walked around King street to look for a restaurant close to the theatre.

The Caesar Salad was very delicious, and the Orecchiette was very good!  I guess I had set low expectations because I had my heart set on our original restaurant choice but the meal ending up being quite good!  I did not like their dessert choices and did not get one, but I found it interesting that the server didn't even offer us to think about dessert.  I had a Caesar as well that had a scoop of horseradish inside it which actually made it taste quite good.  We sat on the \"patio\" which is quite small and we were cramped at a small table, but it wasn't too bad.

Overall, we had a pretty good dinner which I did not expect at all!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to go for special occasions and if you are trying to impress somebody. Great ambience. Dim Lighting. Amazing Wine List. You can see your reflection on the floor. Plus the food was great as well. Meat quality was amazing. I got lamb chops and a steak. Cost me an arm and a leg but was a good trade for a satisfied belly and overall great experience! Its not somewhere i would frequent all the time as it is pricey but if there is an occasion where I want to go above and beyond. This is it !!"}
{"text":"I had been to PAESE Ristorante many years ago when they were located on King Street West in downtown Toronto.  I remember having really fond memories of the meal that B and I had had there.  I remember we went there for Summerlicious and had such an amazing meal -- the service was great, the food was unique and delicious, and the portions were large too.  That still remains one of my favourite meals.  Thus, I was sad when I heard that they had shuttered their downtown location as I thought it was closed for good.  Fortunately, I found out later that they had simply relocated to the midtown area of Bathurst and Wilson.  Since then, I had been curious to return to it to try the food again.

We ordered two cocktails to start.  I had the Paese Collins, a cocktail with beefeater gin, lemon, and a thyme-infused syrou.  It was refreshing!  I was also impressed with this cocktail because there was sufficient alcohol content in it.  After a few sips, I definitely felt the alcohol!  I liked this because it meant that the restaurant did not cheap out on the ingredients.

P had the Paloma Italiana, a cocktail with tequila reposado, Aperol, and grapefruit.  At the time, I think I liked it but it wasn't very memorable now when I'm writing about it.. lol.  (I do remember that it was just as strong as my cocktail meaning that again, they included sufficient alcohol into it -- you'll be surprised at how many restaurants cheap out on the alcohol in cocktails.)

We were served some bread with an olive spread which was so delicious and tasted like fresh olives!  Yummy.

For an antipasto to share, we had the Polenta Fries.  These were polenta fries served with roasted garlic aioli and a sundried tomato ketchup.   I'm a fan of polenta fries but I was really disappointed in this dish because of its portion size.  The presentation of it was unique -- the fries were served in a mini cart with paper.  However, since there were only seven or so polenta fries, it didn't look like there was very much of it at all.  The two dipping sauces were served in small squeezable plastic bottles.  I think to improve this dish, they should display it differently to emphasize the fries and not a couple of small fries in a large cart and plate.

I have tasted better polenta fries before.  The polenta fries that I've had before were thick cut so that you could really taste the polenta in each one.  The polenta fries here were a little dry and over-salted. 

We ordered the Mushroom and Spinach Garganelli pasta dish which contained roasted wild mushrooms and spinach with testun al barolo, parmegiano, and truffle oil.  This was a lovely pasta dish.  I especially liked the mushrooms and spinach!

The Margherita Pizza is a classic pizza to order.  It had mozzarella, fior di latte, basil, and tomato sauce.  Unfortunately, I thought that it's presentation wasn't impressive at all.  I expected the fior di latte to have melted in a more pronounced display on the pizza.  Instead, it looked just like a flat cheese pizza. 

Taste-wise, the Margherita Pizza was all right.  I liked the cheese in it.  I also expected there to have been more fresh basil leaves on it to look better (look at the photo of the Margherita Pizza on their website and you will see a big difference between the stock photo and this real life one).  Instead, the few pieces of basil on it were wilted due to the heat of the pizza.  Each bite of the pizza did have basil flavour though.

We ordered two desserts.  The Verona Chocolate Mousse had Grand Marnier and raspberry coulis.  The chocolate mousse was very soft and creamy.  The chocolate flavour was definitely evident.  It was a pretty dessert too.

One of the desserts that I remembered having from my first visit to Paese that stood out in my mind was the Affogato.  At the time, I remembered there was ice cream where you poured espresso on it and there was a huge delicious cookie (that B and I couldn't even finish because we had been so full that time).  I described it to P and she was curious about it and thus we ordered the Affogato on this visit.  It had white chocolate gelato, espresso, and a warm cherry and chocolate chip cookie.

It wasn't served in the same way as my first impression of it years ago where the chocolate chip cookie was placed on top of the mason jar that the ice cream came in but it looked close enough otherwise.  I didn't have any of the espresso (caffeine robs me of sleep) but I did try the white chocolate gelato and cookie.  Mmm, the white chocolate gelato was really good!!  The warm cherry and chocolate chip cookie was great too.

I'm glad that I got to try the new PAESE again but I was disappointed that they simply serve Italian classics now and the creative dishes that I tried at their King Street PAESE years ago weren't available any longer.  Thus, to me PAESE is just like any other Italian restaurant -- their food was good but did come at a price.  The service was very professional."}
{"text":"I always scratch my head about the mediocre food served on the Theatre Row of King West.  Having dined at many of the restaurants which garner business mostly because of their proximity to the entertainment - I had pretty much given up and just eat dinner earlier at good restaurants that aren't necessarily on this strip.  Though I am a skeptic, I still like to give things a second chance... after all, maybe things have changed?

Last Friday, I needed to grab dinner with my BFF prior to atttending the Wine & Spirits Festival at Sugar Beach.  I had bought a voucher a while back for Paese and seeing as the expiry date was fast-approaching decided to dine there.

We arrived around 7PM with no reservations, but found a spot on their quaint patio.  I also noticed that they had opened up their giant floor-to-ceiling windows to let the natural breeze in to the restaurant.  A cute, orange Volkswagen with the restaurant's name was parked out front.  It reminded me of the car that my high school principal drove, except his was shabby-chic and we dubbed it the \"hippy van.\"

We were given some foccaccia with a mint and roasted garlic hummus to nosh on while the kitchen was busy preparing our order.  I loved the large specks of salt sprinkled on the bread and the roasted garlic hummus was spreadable and yummy!

We shared the Roman Wedge Salad ($10), (which in essence is a reinvented Caesar salad) composed of Iceberg lettuce, roasted garlic mustard dressing, soft boiled egg, crispy capers and Parmesan frico.  While the absence of Pancetta was dearly missed, the salad itself was still quite flavourful with its soft-boiled egg, and creamy dressing.

We also opted to try the Funghi Pizza ($16).  I loved the thin crust, and the drizzle of truffle oil made it fragrant.  The mushrooms were quite flavourful and further accented with thyme.  Yummy!

A trio of hot sauces (Pickled Red Pepper + Chilies, Green Apple + Banana Pepper and Pickled Vegetable + Peperoncini) accompanied the pizza.  Call me a purist, but the pizza was amazing just the way it was!

For our protein fix we ordered their Whole Grilled Fish ($28) which would be a Branzino for the evening.  This was served atop a bed of fregola (similar in texture to barley), mustard and wilted dandelion greens.  The fish had a nice char, and the skin was crispy.  Although those of you who don't fancy boney fish, may want to opt for a fillet instead.  I am a believer that anything boneless is inferior to its fully-boned counterparts.  But that's just me.  I absolutely loved the texture of the fregola and only wished there was more of it!

We also ordered a side (à la carte) - Rapini ($6) tossed in garlic, lemon, and extra virgin olive oil.

V E R D I C T

While you have to mind your elbows as table space seemed more precious than a square footage of Toronto real estate - the food was tasty.

Our bill, with tax and tip came to $78 (less the $50 voucher).  Suffice it to say, that the next time I need to grab a bite pre-theatre in this neck of the woods - Paese will be where you'll find me."}
{"text":"Free corkage on your first bottle of wine every day but Saturday!? A great place to bring a nice bottle of wine and enjoy cool the atmosphere. They have a beautiful wine cellar downstairs that you can see on your way to the bathrooms. And according to our server, the bottles are only marked up by 25$ (much less than what most restaurants will charge for decent wines).

We had a female server who was really helpful and genuine.Get the grilled octopus app. -- it is delightful. The pizzas are good, but aren't anything special."}
{"text":"Went for Valentine's Day lunch with my gal pal.

We shared a ceasar salad. It was great with a lot of colour - different types of lettuce, half a soft boiled egg, crispy parmesan chips and a light dressing.

Then we had the Genova pizza. That rocked but the olives were a little salty. The salami was perfect. All the pizzas do come with a side of hot sauces but you have to ask sometime. I ask early to use it for the complimentary rosemary sea salt bread!

Why did I give this review a 3. Worst service ever. She was very grumpy and when she dropped a knife on me she didn't even apologize! I'm sorry. You are in the service industry. You have to be happy. That should be a prerequisite and mandatory on any application.

ah Paese... much love but bring back the hottie waiter I had last time!"}
{"text":"Outstanding , delicious meal.  We went at 5:30 on a Tuesday so it wasn't very busy that early.  Good service and all 4 of our meals were delicious.
I have never been disappointed in their catering and now am so pleased I was able to sit and enjoy a meal in this restaurant.  We will be back soon for more."}
{"text":"Four of us went for Summerlicious on a busy Saturday night.   They do not skimp on the portions here.   Immediately upon sitting down we were presented with fresh bread with a dip made of jicama.  Delicious sweet change from hummus or butter.  Bread melted in your mouth.
Had a 21 for appetizer (a take off on Lee's slaw) and it was excellent.  The sardine app was good and the very good soup of the day (leek and potato with gorgonzola) was a hit.
I had the arctic char for my main - a nice size piece of fish on a bed of delicious vegetables.   My partner and another guest had the ribs - they were meaty and moist.  The veal scalllopini was predictable - apparently a solid good choice by that diner.  
We all had different desserts - lemon tart, italian tart and chocolate decadence.  The chocolate decadence was decadent - a huge serving which was obliterated!  No counting calories when something is so delicious and sinful!
None of us were drinking and we all ordered from the Summerlicious menu but the staff there was friendly and attentive and was constantly checking on us.  Service was excellent - food was delicious - value was unbelievable - we all walked out stuffed from a summerlicious menu.   Will definitely be coming back on a regular basis!   If summerlicious was so good can't wait to try other regular items on the menu."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Food. Service. Decor.  I passed the restaurant for years and wish id only gone sooner. A true dining experience. Make sure u leave room for the Chocolate/Nutella dessert -- :D"}
{"text":"Paese serves comfortable and familiar Italian meals, in a spacious location just outside of the city.

Came here for dinner with my girlfriend and ordered a good amount of food. We started with a Paese Collins and an Old Italian Fashioned for drinks, which were well made and tasty, and went very well with the complimentary focaccia bread and accompanying dip.

For appetizers, we started with the grilled octopus and beef tartare. The grilled octopus was perfectly cooked, and the sauce on the dish paired very well with the smoky octopus flavour. The beef tartare, which felt a lot more French than it did Italian, was also tasty.

Our mains were the funghi pizza and the grilled whole fish of the day, which was sea bream. The pizza was probably my least favourite dish of the evening, where the crust just did not have very much cheese on it (and it lacked flavour), and it was more of a spongy mass than anything else. The mushroom flavours are always hard to beat though, so I gave it a pass.

When our server brought over the grilled whole sea bream, he asked if we were okay to cut it up or if we'd like him to take care of it for us. We weren't so confident in our own skills, so we asked him to do it. What followed was a table-side preparation of the fish, where our server carefully removed the bones of the fish, and providing us with prepared cuts of sea bream for our enjoyment. The fish itself was tasty, and the squeeze of lemon we put on top really gave it some zest.

For dessert, we ended with an affogato and a sorbetto. The sorbetto was mostly forgettable, but was a light and refreshing way to end the meal. The affogato on the other hand, came with a giant cookie and a large jar with gelato inside, which I poured the espresso into. The mixture of hot and cold from espresso meeting gelato is a great sensation for the mouth, along with the sweet and bitter flavours, were an even better way to end the meal. Topped off with that perfectly made cookie, and you got yourself one hell of a dessert.

Overall, our meal at Paese was solid. Comfortable and familiar Italian food, with a few misses and mostly hits, Paese is a great place to take a date or hang out with friends over good food."}
{"text":"My rating is based on service, food, and atmosphere.

I went to Paese tonight with a friend for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed it.

I was greeted by a super nice and funny hostess who led me to the bar while I waited for my friend to park and the bartender was just as funny and sociable as she was. We were seated promptly and our waiter was really knowledgeable on everything on the menu. He recommended a good beer for my friend and helped him decide which meal to get, which he wound up liking in the end. The waiter came by a lot, but somehow always at the right time. Never annoying. So in terms of service, this place is phenomenal.

The food was good. We started with the grilled shrimp and the pancetta wrapped scallops which were both fantastic. Thoroughly impressed with both of those. For dinner I got the veal and spinach ravioli and my friend got the potato cavatelli I believe. Something with boar's meat in it. Anyway, both were ok. Not as good as the starters, but well cooked and original. Maybe we shouldn't have ordered pasta. Either way, the food wouldn't stop me from trying this place again. There was obvious attention to detail, might just be my palate.

The atmosphere is good. Not dead, not too loud. Tasteful, simple decor. High ceilings, italian music playing all night. I went on a Wednesday so I'm sure on a Friday it would be even more bustling. 

All in all, a good experience. I'd definitely go back just for the friendly service."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch. There is nothing else like it in the area.  A varied Italian menu.  Exceptional service and quality of food. Ask for the chili plate in addition to the oil at the table if you want to add some heat to your meal.  Large portions, but save room for dessert too!   I have been there with 2 people, other couples as well as hosting a party there in the 2nd floor party room."}
{"text":"After the big TOronto FC victory and Iriana losing her voice after yelling at the apposing team, we both were in serious need of food therapy! Thankfully with Exhibition place not being too far from King St West we decided to head to Paese! 

What made me fall in love with this place is their cute outdoor patio, but inside was just as lovely.  Cute, contemporary, not too dim yet intimate, Paese makes you want to chillout and unwind once you step foot inside.  Once in, our waiter quickly sat us down, and we were greeted by our server! :) 

FOr drinks we both had their Quattro Fontemara 2011 Red, which was a nice blend of various grapas; merlot, sangiovese, etc...etc.. so it was easy to drink along with our foods we ordered; 

Fried Polenta; lightly breaded with a garlic aioli! breaded to perfection, and not oily! well presented.

Roman Salad: baby Kale, toasted capers, boiled egg topped off with Parmegiano frico and caesar dressing.. this was a delighfully fresh dish!!!

Italian Ham pizza! was great! just way too much Arugula! and I found the pizza to be a little charred underneath! 

Overall, the service, and the servers were quite personable! in fact one of them started speaking to us in some Spanish which was pretty cool! The only reason why this was not a PERFECT 5 was due to the pizza being slightly burnt at the bottom!!"}
{"text":"Went for a Birthday Friday night and I had the Lambshank, rapini and one of the meatball appetizer/dishes.  Food was really good and the overall ambiance of the place was great.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent wine list.  Attentive service.  Carefully crafted salads.   Wonderful entrees all around. 

Intimate space.  Good for a business dinner or other small group. 

All adults in attendance.   No kids menu. 

Tight parking.  Reservations a must."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and staff! It's a very fancy area and the servers are so nice. Store owner or manager was very nice enough to give me some deserts along with my take home leftovers. I recommend this place for special events such as birthdays and dates! Such a romantic place and a very perfect cozy setting. Definitely would come back. I can't complain, just perfect!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for Italian fine dining just north of midtown, this is it. Paese is consistently excellent, and has been for years.

They seem to do everything well, from pizzas to meats and seafood. Last night the specials were a grilled octopus salad appetizer and steak with mushroom risotto entree. Both were superbly executed and delicious. Our table also ordered veal scallopini (fabulous) and perfectly cooked, grilled whole fish stuffed with garlic, lemon and thyme. For dessert we opted for affogato with a shot of Frangelico (if you love affogato--a shot of espresso poured over ice cream--try it with Frangelico for an extra 2 bucks, trust me) which also came with a plate of soft cookies. Outstanding!

A reliable bet for a quality meal!"}
{"text":"Had the best time here tonight.  My friends took me out for my birthday and I am so glad they recommended this place.  Short but sweet. .. decor was tasteful and well done, , food was fresh,  delicious and perfect portions,  Menu was easy to read,  wine list was impeccable and mostly. .... The service from ALL the staff was the best I have had in about 3 years. .. as much as I would come back for the food. ...I rather enjoyed the service best.  Our main server was knowledgeable but not arrogant,  professional but not at all distant,  easy on the eyes (actually the whole staff was attractive) and he gave us glasses of ice wine to celebrate my birthday. ..I will be telling everyone I know to come here. .. just a lovely place to be. ... Thank you for the good time."}

{"text":"I was here for a 20 year Tignanello vertical tasting last year and was blown away with their food and wine list (only a $25 markup on Tig). 

Finally got back yesterday for a lunch and it reaffirmed how good this place is. Service is top notch, food is great, good selection of by the glass wines and their wine list is extensive and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I have eaten in the majority of Toronto's \"fine dining\" establishments. After receiving mediocre service and overpriced food, I end up with a big bill and little value at the end of the night. This is not the case at Paese. This restaurant has been around for years and there is a reason for that.  It doesnt oversell, it is not overhyped but it delivers consistently.  I was there tonight and was met promptly by a polite server who took my drink order, informed me about the specials and was attentive but didnt hover over my table. The food was perfectly done, nicely plated and tasted fantastic....most importantly, it did NOT come out cold.  Take my word, you can go downtown and 7 times out of 10 you will get robbed when the bill comes (because the food was no where as good as you thought, service was crap, and you are hungry). If you want to avoid the heart ache and enjoy a nice dinner out, head over to Paese."}
{"text":"I used my TeamBuy coupon $20 for $40 last Friday. Man was this place busy! We got seated by the entrance, not the best spot in the world. 

The waitress was extremely friendly and gave us wonderful recommendation, The Funghi (Mushroom Pizza), the Ricotta Gnocchi and their House Smoked Beef Short Ribs. 

The pizza was delish, seriously. The crest wasnt too thin nor too thick. And my friend liked their deep fried crest taste. The Ricotta Gonocchi - AMAZING. When I first saw it (white, creamy, thick) I was afraid it might be too rich and cheesy, but it wasn't at all. The dish literally melts away in your mouth. The short ribs was smokey but sweet when you add the sauce and the choice of veggies was made to compliment the meat. You can tell some thought process went through when making that dish. 

Overall the staff was extremely knowledgeable of the food and very friendly. Special thank you to Jasmine and Kate for the wonderful recommendations. I definitely recommend this place and I am very interested in trying their King location now. 

It would have been 5 stars if it wasnt for the seating, but the General Manager told me to let her know the next time to seat me and my friend somewhere better."}
{"text":"Paese has my favorite pizza with figs (as seen on photo) but they have way more to offer and please you with, amongst that their fish and meat entrees and a selection of exceptional wines, five stars. I have celebrated there my birthday twice with a group of friends who understand gourmet food well. Will recommend 100%"}
{"text":"I went here with my family and had a blast. The server we had (although I forgot his name) was superb and knew the menu inside out. The food took a while to come out but they held us off by giving us delicious bread and olive oil. I ordered the lamb risotto and it was out of this world!  My father had the fish and it was also very tasty. Overall, I would recommend going here if you want some great food. Make a reservation if you go on the weekend as this place can get busy!"}
{"text":"This is a great italian mainstay - I know I'll always get a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I generally avoid this strip of restaurants on King West, as I find them usually overpriced and surviving solely because of tourists and theatre-goers. But I decided to give Paese a try during the Telus Taste of Tuesday promotion and had a lovely dinner with a good friend. 

The place is modern and elegant. I really liked the square tables at the back and made a mental note to remember this place the next time I am planning something with a big group. Square (or round) tables make so much more sense for groups, as everyone can see and talk to each other. With those long rectangular ones, you end up just talking to the people in your immediate vicinity. Anyways...

We had:
- Waiter brought some baguette and carrot (and something else?) spread to the table. 

- Pear and gorgonzola salad - nice, classic
- Meatballs - they were HUGE. This was a bit of a mistake because I was full before the main course! Delicious blend of flavours -- I could really taste the pecorino. 

- Lamb striploin - came with a nice chickpea mash. 
- Arctic char - with pistachio, carrot, lemon ferro. A light, simple dish. 

- Pistachio and brown butter cake - we both found this a tad dry
- Affogato - the winner of the evening! A dish of chestnut gelato (just divine!), served with a tiny cup of espresso that you pour over the gelato yourself. I've never had anything like it and it was a wonderful contrast. It comes with a huge cherry and dark chocolate chip cookie that was warm and soft, as all cookies should be. But it was so big, I took it home. 

I had a glass on the pinot grigio and our server brought over the sommelier to help my friend choose something to go with her lamb (Chianti). Apparently, this is a great place to go if you really know wine, but I don't. 

We stayed for ~4 hours and nobody rushed us out, which was nice (if it was really busy though, we would've given up our table out of courtesy). They only brought the bill when we asked for it. 

I will probably be back to try the pasta and to get the affogato again!

*P.S. someone should tell them to change this pic on the website (http://paeseristorante.com/team). It looks like a mafia pic:S"}
{"text":"Food was very good but service was pretentious to the point of being rude.  Price point was a bit high for the food offering"}
{"text":"Generally I don't go to King St theatre row restaurants, but I do live nearby and had heard good things, so when there was a groupon (or wagjag or fabfind... can't keep track of them all :P), I took the opportunity to try it out.

What we ordered:

Appetizer:
- meatballs -- pretty good, but nothing that special
- grilled octopus -- the texture was almost powdery - it didn't really taste fresh

Main:
- Fish special - whole grilled branzino -- this was good, with crispy skin and tender meat. The skin was a tad on the salty side, but otherwise, very good. Just watch out for those tiny bones!
- Goat's Cheese and Chickpea Agnolotti -- this was also delicious; my meat-eating partner actually liked this better than the other meat pasta dish

We also had a really cool drink that involved liquid nitrogen - very cool to order just to watch them make it! The idea behind it is that it freezes the drink without diluting it with ice - clever!

The service was also generally good, and the decor is dark, classy and cosy - perfect for a stormy cold night like the one I went on.

The portion size was a big on the small side, and even with the groupon, the bill was still pretty big.

In summary, a good Italian place if you're looking for something on Theatre Row. However, I've had better pasta at Buca and Paganelli's Risotteria-Enoteca (formerly Romagna Mia)."}
{"text":"I had a very pleasant experience today at Paese. A girlfriend of mine recommended it  and, since I love trying out new places, in we went for lunch.

We were immediately greeted at the door and showed to a comfortable table. The atmosphere was nice. A warm setting with jazz playing in the background (not too loud).

The lunch menu was not too extensive (that's a good sign) yet full of very delicious things. I chose the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, while my friend went with the Scrabbled Eggs on Toast made with mascarpone cheese (I stole some from her and found them fluffy and amazing). My pancakes were quite good as well. Full of ricotta cheese and blueberry jam. The only downside was that they were slightly burned on one side. The place was not very busy so there should have been no reason for that to happen.

The portions were very the perfect size, and I liked our server (attentive, informative, but not overbearing).

Overall, it is a good place for brunch and definitely worth revisiting."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes...

An Italian restaurant win such a prime spot on Bathurst.. you would think would have good food, I was wrong.

The best part of the meal was the bread that they bring to the table- yum!! 

Three dishes were ordered : Mushroom Pasta, Veal and Plane Spaghetti with tomato sauce-- NONE had any flavour. 

We had to send the spaghetti back not once, twice but THREE times.. it was not cooked- tasted like rubber and was super hard to chew. 

The Mushroom pasta was pure oil, and the Veal... just no.

I wish I had a better experience because there is not really good Italian in this area.. I guess there still isn't."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant with an excellent wine list well exceeding what is expected from a restaurant this size.

Food is solid here as is the service. They accomodate different dietary needs quite well, so don't be afraid to ask them to make adjustments to their dishes - they are eager to please!

Even though I am a big meat eater, I was particularly impressed with their chickpea bolognese with zucchini noodles. It's one of their biggest sellers and I can see why, totally delicious!

Recommended if you find yourself in the North York area."}
{"text":"We went there last night for dinner, it was a group of 8. We had made reservations,  two of the members from our group were running a bit late.  Before they arrive a big guy comes and says that we can only give you your table for another 1.5 hours and we should have you out of here. three minutes later someone comes back and says we need you guys out of here before your 8:15. 
Not the best way to start your evening. 
The rest of our party arrives and we order our meals right away.  3 people got the spaghetti and meatballs,  one person got the veal, one person got a Margarita pizza, one a garganzale pasta, one short ribs and I can't remember what the other got. We also had apps,  most of the party had beet salad, which they could barely see the beets, we also had the Paese green salad, which felt like a container of dole arugula mix from Loblaws. It was the biggest waist of money on $14 salad ever. 2 of the 3 people with spaghetti liked it, the garganzale pasta was crap, absolute garbage,  the big dude said it was made with cheese and marinated in a wine sauce and it was great. We'll it was crap, saw no cheese, the pasta cooked well, and as for the sauce it had wine poured over it.  Total sham.
We also had ordered beers and drinks, we asked the for a non alcoholic drink,  something fizzy. The big dude comes with juice and fiz, fine. We get the bill they charged us $15 for fruit juice. Total waste of money. Bad service,  mean intimidating looking hostess.
Will never come back."}
{"text":"Paese Ristorante is a pleasant high-end Italian restaurant located in Wilson Heights. It's not in a location where you would typically find other fancy restaurants therefore stands out on its own. It's attached to L'eat Catering, the original parent company that provided food to local businesses since 1983. Afterwards, Paese Ristorante was created in 1989. L'eat Catering is one of the top 5 catering companies within Toronto,

I had the pleasure of sampling some items off of Paese's menu with my cousin. I tried one of their cocktails, which was the Paloma Italiana with pink grapefruit. I really liked it because I am a huge fan of sweet girly drinks. So it was a great choice for my preference. My cousin picked up their Bellini but found that the prosecco overwhelmed the taste of the peach nectar.

I highly recommend one of their appetizers, the Grilled Octopus. We absolutely loved the dressing mixed with the vegetables that came along with the octopus. It was a perfect blend of taste. Afterwards, we got to try a couple of their pizzas. We had the Pollo and Laabroni. I think their Pollo, which consisted of roasted chicken, smoked cheddar, eggplant, sliced tomato and basil, to be the best of the two. It had the best combination of toppings since I'm a huge fan of cheesy pizza and eggplant.

We tried pasta next. My cousin got one of their basic spaghetti dishes (I don't think it's on the menu) and I tasted their Ricotta Gnocchi. I liked the gnocchi in my dish but not so much of the chicken that was mixed in with it. The chicken was quite bland and was out of place in terms of taste. My cousin wasn't a fan of the spaghetti either. The two pasta dishes we tried were a missed for us.

Lastly, we made room for dessert. I got the Butterscotch Pudding and my cousin chose the Strawberry Cheesecake Parfait. When I took the first bite of the Butterscotch Pudding, it was perfect. The more I ate though, the sweeter it became, As someone who no longer craves super sweet desserts, it got overwhelming for my taste buds. I recommend this dessert, but only if you share it with someone else.

Paese has great customer service if that is what you are looking for in a dining experience. They also do private bookings."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and both times were good.  Ya - it's a little pricey but they know what they are doing when it comes to food.  Very good quality.  The waiter was a little slow my second time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dining here.   The food was great and the staff were friendly and professional.   I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant.   It wasn't very loud but it wasn't so quiet either that you can't have a decent conversation.   It was very comfortable.   A great place to go on a date or have dinner with the girls.  I would definitely go dine there again."}
{"text":"I love dining out with friends, especially fellow food-blogger friends who understand the importance of taking photos before eating the meal.  This was the case a few weeks ago when 4 foodies dined out at the lovely Paese restaurant located at 3827 Bathurst Street in North York.

Linda, Shuang, Via and myself were invited to Paese to try out some Italian-inspired eats in this cozy restaurant that has been around for 25 years.  The menu is quite vast, with many meat, seafood, pizza and pasta options.  The menu stays true to Paese's philosophy of food that is \"inspired by Italy, Made in Canada'.  The chef's use traditional techniques combined with homemade precision to create comforting meals with a modern twist.  Not only is the food exceptional at Paese, but the multi-regional wine list is quite memorable housing over 800 labels in their wine cellars. The 4 of us arrived at Paese just before the rush and were seated at a lovely window table so that we could have the sought-after natural light for our food photos.  How ideal ;) Our waiter was very friendly and helpful in helping us decide on drinks, appetizers, mains and dessert.  After some tough deliberations here's what we tried:


Complimentary Homemade Focaccia with White Bean Dip
Mojito and Paloma Cocktails
Polenta Fries with Roasted Garlic Aioli & Sundried Tomato Ketchup - $9
Grilled Octopus with Potato,Grilled Escarole, Mint, Lemon & Chili - $16
Roasted Scallops with Fennel and Tarragon Slaw & Citrus and Blood Orange Vinaigrette - $16
Pan-Fried Salmon with Potato, Tomato/Olive Relish, Beans & Roast Corn - Special of the Day
Veal Scaloppini Al Limone - $27
Grilled Lamb Striploin with Cherry Compote - $29
Goat Cheese & Leek Ravioli - $18
Strawberry Cheesecake Parfait - $11
Cioccolato - $11
Butterscotch Pudding - $11
White Chocolate Affogatto and Cookie - $10

My favourite appetizers were the Scallops and Grilled Octopus.  Both dishes were cooked to perfection which is very important when it comes to seafood.  The scallops were big and juicy and paired very nicely with the fennel and citrus flavours.  The octopus was the main highlight for me. It was nicely charred and tender, I could've ate the entire portion all by myself.

My main was the Salmon Special which is not always on the menu but they do have a similar dish with Steelhead Trout which is always available.  The salmon was done very well with great flavour and accompaniments. 

The best dessert was the lovely Cioccolato which is composed of a dark chocolate terrina with white chocolate mousse, nutella and hazelnut brittle. It was full of delicious chocolate flavour but wasn't overly rich or sweet. I had the Strawberry Cheesecake Parfait which was nothing special. It would've been better as a layered cake with fresh strawberries.

Paese is definitely worth checking out if you want to experience a lovely dining atmosphere outside of the busy downtown area. The menu has so many options which cater to everyone and everything is reasonably priced.  Paese also offers private dining for business or social functions, takes reservations, has free parking and has a partner catering company called L-eat Catering."}
{"text":"2.5 Star for the Total Experience

4 Star for Excellent Food

Winterlicious 2012 Lunch menu $20 is surprisingly good. 

Really Good Soup 
- Caramelized onion soup is sweet and flavoured with a tough of cheese
- Hearty and Light as the same time

Potato cavatelli and slow cooked turkey bolognese 
- Pasta has this look of little worms
- cooked perfectly al dente, chewy and soft at the same time
- tomato sauce was light and has a touch of parsley

Affogato
- I love dishes with contrast always a fan of Affogato
- White Chocolate Ice Cream and a shot of Espresso
- Hot vs Cold, Sweet vs Bitter
- The cookie on the side was soft and moisture 

Coffee ($3.50)
- Smell so good and I just love French Press

1.5 Star for Indifference and Mediocre Service

I was one of the 3 tables here for a late lunch. With 2 waiter on the floor I should not feel that I am ignored at times or my reasonable request for my bill and cash me out  a burden to the staffs. An experience comparable to my Hong Kong Style Cafe which I paid $3.50 for a lunch special.

I ordered my dessert with the app and main and by the the time for dessert they just drop the cup of cookies in front of me without saying a word until I told him I ordered the Affogato. 

I really enjoyed the food and the deco of the restaurant but I don't think I will be back because of the service."}
{"text":"I went twice to Paese and both times I enjoyed the food very much.

I found that the food had a very traditional Italian flavour to it.
I had a chickpea and jerusalem artichoke ravioli, and my buddy had a really nice cavatelli pasta dish.

It was a bit pricey, but the food completely home-made and the service was decent.

I will go back, yet again!"}
{"text":"Frozen seafood, chewy steak, greasy pizza. Pass!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on New Year's Eve, and it was absolutely amazing. They had complimentary bread with a dill cheese spread which was delicious. I had the super sour martini to start, which was also great. They had some specials for new years-calamari stuffed with lobster in a meat sauce. It was AMAZING! For dinner, I ordered the lamb striploin and my boyfriend got the beef tenderloin. They were both perfectly cooked. I wasn't crazy about the figs with my lamb, but everything else was perfect. The beef tenderloin was aged by the restaurant itself and came with these little tiny potato bites. We inhaled our food! They also have brunch on weekends and I would definitely go there again. The server was great, knowledgeable and very attentive."}
{"text":"Started off the meal with freshly baked bread with some sort of tomato tapenade mixture. Absolutely delicious! 

The grilled shrimp was okay, good sized shrimp, but I wasn't blown away. The meatballs were packed tightly and were also okay. The tomato sauce was really good though. 

For my main, I had the orecchiette which was recommended by two of the staff working that evening. It was actually very good and I was very happy with my dish! 

The butterscotch pudding dessert was nothing special. 

Service was exactly what you expect. On point and very knowledgable."}
{"text":"PAESE Ristorante ~ Messy Meatball [EVENT] 

Last week I was invited to PAESE Ristorante (@PaeseRistorante) for a Messy Meatball Monday where they launched their new late night menu. What a sign to welcome us and I know it's going to be a great night already ;)

Each guest was given a bib and we were encourage to write our best balls joke ;)

The Ducé
~ Yes practically anything can go on top of a Caesar these days from bacon to lobster but this one was just wow....
~  it's a play on the Caesar where their San Marzano tomato sauce they use on their meatballs was use. 
~ It's not as if you dunk the meatball in or anything and it was sort of messy to eat but it was a great presentation and I'll have one any time of the day.
~ I  Caesar

PAESE Meatball
~ house ground beef short rib sirloin brisket, pecorino, braised in tomato sauce
~ This was so tender and perfectly flavored, this was the most traditional meatball of the night and I have to say it was my favorite.

Veal Meatball
~ house ground veal, pork, ricotta w/ sweet peas cipollini onions, braised in milk
~ This was lighter and milder in taste and as per the chef, it'll be their Summer meatball.
~ Love how it was braised in milk which gave such a soft and moist texture.

Chicken Wing Meatball
~ spicy pepperoncini chicken meatball w/ gorgonzola dipping sauce
~ Chicken wing without the bones?! This probably have the prettiest presentation with the bright colors.

Pepperoni Arancini Meatballs
~ house smoked mozzarella, salsa verde & chili mayo
~ This was suppose to taste like a pepperoni pizza and I thought it was just a arancini... 
~ but I do love arancini, who doesn't like fried rice ball and this was a cheesy one with an extremely yummy salsa verde.

There was suppose to be a Falafel Balls but we didn't get that one, really wanted to try this one since it's the only vegetarian ball and I love falafel :(

 Balls on Bun
~ smashed balls, tomato sugo, dill pickles, potato chips, provoline on mini brioche buns
~ The brioche was rather dry and hard and it was rather messy to eat since it was rather high but love the added chips for the crunch ;)

Meatball Margherita
~ mozzarella, basil, tomato sauce & meatball
| The meatball was served on top of the pizza where the crush it at the table which I found was sort of a failed attempt... just look how it mess up the cheese and sauce when crushing the meatball. 
| I have to say that I was presently surprise that I actually like the crust, it was extremely thin, crispy and not soggy at all.... 
| but I have to say that the basil was def lacking (the few small specks of green on it doesn't count) and without it, you can't call it a margherita. 

 Thanks Chef Palik (@ChefPalik) for coming up with all those different meatballs, we left stuffed and satisfied.... maybe a dessert \"ball\" is missing?!? (just saying).
All of these item are now available on their late night menu (here)
And thanks to Suzanne Dunbar from The L-Eat Group for inviting me to such a great event (^_^)

Verdict :
~ There's definetly a meatball for everyone.
~ Would definetly love to come back for some meatballs and of course The Ducé.
~ And I learn today that they have no corkage fee everyday but Saturday #BYOW

P.S: Their Parmesan & Black Pepper Cashews are killer, would kill for a bucket of it

*** This meal was complimentary. Opinions are my own***"}
{"text":"Service was superb.  Atmosphere was also superb.

Food was good.  I don't mean \"great\" or \"superb\".  I mean good.   But given the price they charge, good is not good enough; I was expecting better.

The Chicken Saltimbocca was tasty but a tad overdone.  The Lamb Striploin was good, but I wish there were a bit more of it.

The sides were spectacular, but they were ... sides.  I was kind of hoping for the entrees to make more of an impression.  If the place were cheaper, it would be a solid 3 or perhaps even 4 stars."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money at Paese, unless:

- You positively enjoy decreased portions for increased price. The smaller the portion and the higher the price, the better;

- You simply love them smallish menus of nothing to choose except for the bare essentials. Just one page, but so much fun reading it again and again while trying to make your mind!

- You honestly believe that a plate of chicken salad could be considered a main course;

- You awww from joy when your teeth crack over a piece of uneatable stuff in your chicken \"fillet\". Twice for like four chunks of chicken in the whole salad;

- You feel even better when the plate with those pieces remains on your table for the time of your staying, so you can observe them. You also don't mind dirty plates and napkins on the neighbouring tables;

- You are feeling comfortable when a waiter tosses the next plate directly in your hand, while you are still working on the previous one, all that without even looking at you;

- You enjoy when another waiter yells from the middle of the room: \"S'allokay for u ser?!?\" - so you can burp and wave your hand, showing how good do you actually feel;

And you particularly love when a glass of wine for 12-15 bucks results to be just a half of glass. Even a bit less than that, oh yes.

On the positive side, at least those guys are honest. They don't call themselves an \"Italian\" restaurant. They say something like: \"Inspired by Italy, made in Canada\". Such openness is actually good, appreciate that. No way to complain about yet another fake \"Italian\" food place.

Decor is cute, and ambient music is smartly selected - so if that's what you eat, Paese may be a good choice.

Otherwise, not recommended."}
{"text":"For the money I wasn't impressed. I got tastier food at an Olive Garden. The vegetable soup had the consistency of baby food and the meatballs had an unchewable hard piece in one of them."}
