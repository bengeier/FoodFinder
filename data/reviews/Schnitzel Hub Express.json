{"text":"Dropped by the schnitzel hub this afternoon for the first time, was craving something super comforting/savoury and..... cheesy.......and delicious.  I ordered the \"mama mia\" sandwich with eggplant (trying to eat mostly vegetarian) and it was huge! Did I mention mouth-wateringly-cheesy and delicious? Super satisfying! Could definitely have split that sandwich with someone else, but it was one of those days where I just ate the entire thing with absolute pleasure and zero regret.  Very friendly staff, I took my food to go but there is some bar seating by the window that I'm sure would be pleasant enough...enjoy a little mow down whilst people watching;)  Would 100% come by again :)"}
{"text":"If you've been waiting for a quick bite that will make you exclaim, what the schnitz! ...You've come to the right place.  This is Schnitzel Hub's second location, but the first time I've visited any of their locations. I was very impressed by the clean and modern surroundings. There is an open kitchen and little wooden mallets decorating a feature wall. An ode to schnitzel!    I ordered the Toronto Sanwhich with veal, and it comes with fried onions and mushrooms. The schitz itself was fried to order and SO delicious. The bun (ciabatta?) was perfectly crusty and there seemed to be a lemon aioli that was a nice, delicate touch. The goulash soup (a must-order wherever I go) could have had a bit more meat in the meat:vegetable ratio, but it still warmed my soul and was full of flavour.   Also, I preordered the food via the Feedback App, so not only did I get a discount but it was super easy to pick up! These guys know their stuff."}
{"text":"My favourite place to eat! Loveliest staff, amazing food... I come from Europe and it felt like home. Great prices through Feedback app, also they have student specials! Definitely 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I'm loving the express concept. I'm already a fan of the location on St Clair & Yonge but this is a little easier for me to get to as a West Ender (Big Ups Bloor Line and these awesome bike lanes!) it's also far more casual and much more my style. I got the Toronto sandwich with cheese, mushrooms sauerkraut and fried onions... delicious."}
