{"text":"Run of the mill fast food Italian style. Veal sandwich was ok. Free toppings, but only one piece of veal. Standard pizzas and regular salads. Not bad, but definitely nothing special."}
{"text":"The pasta was nice, 
Then I ate some of the garlic toast my appetite was instantly ruined as I could taste of contact to some sort of cleaner, terrible that I told the waitress and the concern was not even blinked at by the kitchen staff, as a restaurant manager myself I would have gone out of my way to make it right. Never going back."}
{"text":"Had a hot veal sandwich with extra sauce, it was very tasty and hot. The veal portion was a bit on the super thin side, otherwise it would have been rated as a 5/5. Quick and friendly service.
Would recommend this place and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Tried spaghetti with tomato sauce and grilled chicken as well as a sausage panini.

Both were pretty good. The panini was slightly better in my opinion. It was a pretty big portion so the price is justified, can easily share one for lunch. The white Italian bread was quite delicious and the toppings were tasty although not particularly flavourful. In fact the whole panini lacked a lot of flavour but somehow hit the right buttons. The sausage tasted great though so can't complain.

Spaghetti was cooked just right and the sauce was also quite good. Not as good as what you get at Abruzzo but quite good nonetheless.

Service was quick and upbeat. The owners/staff are still getting used to the pace and their customers but I suspect they will be successful as the quality of the food is pretty good.

One thing I noticed they sell pizza by slice however they seemed to keep the pizza not under a warming lamp so not quite sure how they plan to serve the slices, whether they will reheat them or whatnot. Just something to be aware and maybe the restaurant can improve on.

There was no menu or take out menu so I took a shot of the wall menu and uploaded for other Yelper's."}
{"text":"I ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and got spaghetti with chicken and a tasteless white sauce served with a side of burnt garlic toast. My husband ordered lasagna and a side of meatballs, also served with a side of their signature burnt toast! We couldn't have been more disappointed in the quality and care of our order. The pasta did not taste authentic in the slightest and any chef (professional or not) would know better than to serve a customer burnt bread! Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The pasta was good but the garlic toast had a cleanser taste to it? Ruin my meal otherwise I would have returned, I informed the waitress to the taste and the response she was given by the kitchen was vulgar and insultingly load enough for me to over hear ... I will not go F my self, I will advise all not to eat at your establishment and i use that term loosely.. unacceptable and unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service at a great price 
One of the hidden gems in king city
Pizza was one of the best and the hot sauce was amazing. You can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! The place is spotless clean with the friendliest staff. A must try, a must visit multiple times."}
