{"text":"Amazing authentic and all made fresh! Street tacos were Yum! Taco salad was delicious and the shell was made right in front of me."}
{"text":"Small authentic restaurant with a lucha libre theme. Old school photos around the restaurant as well as metal artwork. Food was made to order with fresh looking vegetables and thick authentic guacamole. Employees took their time to apply each ingredient making sure you get all the flavors in one bite. Definitely would go back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I was really happy when this spot opened in Mesa. We always went to the one in Tempe and it was so bomb.

The taste: This location is almost hit or miss. Sometimes it's really good and other times it's just meh. I've tried their street tacos, nachos, sopes and burritos. And always wash it down with a bottled coke. A little pricey for what's offered but everything taste pretty fresh. 

The service: the people I've come across have always been incredibly nice and greet us with a smile when we come in. 

What I hope for: is that every time I go to the salsa bar that there is salsa available. Sometimes there is and sometimes there's not. Wish they had more on the menu but then again service is kinda slow anyways so maybe the limited menu is a good thing. 

Anyhow the food beats \"bertos when I'm craving for some tacos.  Now all I want is a pupusa shop nearby."}
{"text":"Cute little taco shop. The decor was interesting and bright. The women serving food were very nice and seemed very happy to serve us. They gave my boyfriend and I a free sample of their chips and jalapeño cream cheese which is really quite excellent. 

We both ordered the 5 street tacos. She let us pick 2 different meats. I picked the super spicy shredded beef and spicy chicken. The spicy beef is not for the weak. It was awesome! My mouth is still tingling from the heat!! Loved it. The chicken ones were okay, but I loved how you could dress all of your tacos any way you want. I also paired my meal with horchata. Hands down some of the best horchata I've ever had and definitely helped cool the taco fire. We will be back. Definitely great prices and warm and inviting atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here and totally enjoyed my Bandera Wet Burrito.  Both sauces were excellent and the Tinga Chipotle Chicken was fabulous!!!

Large portion so lunch for tomorrow.  Will definitely be back and try more things on the menu.   

Great value for the money.  Give these folks a try, you won't be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy to try a new taco shop! With high hopes of the reviews online, we expected the best!!! Weeeellll!!! First coming in we were greeted with great welcoming ladies, next we looked at the menu confused if the main meals came with rice and beans factoring that the price of everything was a little high, and a lot more of a Chipotle type. The flavors of almost all the meats, and sauces were very very delicious, but the carne asade wasn't tasty! It was reheated on the grill. Our tacos 5 for $8 (street tacos) wasn't worth that amount  , I would expect the flavors of these tacos compared to a elective class back in high school! My wet burrito was hella good, huge size,but was very very skimpy on the meat and rice! 

Would I return??! For the burrito maybe! Would I pay more then $8 for the extra meat and rice?! Nope! 

For the amount of money spent, I was hoping to at least get free chips with the salsa bar, and or rice and beans! I hope the management looks over the reviews and rethinks what is offered with higher priced foods! Cheers"}
{"text":"Very tasty authentic street tacos. Glad they have a yummy spot near by. Red chicken is amazing. Rancho carne is also amazing. I didn't eat tortillas since I'm on a keto diet but the meats we're scrumptious. Will come again."}
{"text":"Got the surf n turf quesadilla to go. Got back to work and it was still hot and fresh. It was so good and just the right amount of spice to it! I will definitely be going back to try other things very soon! So happy to have a good taco shop so close to work!"}
{"text":"Had some great street tacos. Salsa bar is tasty and spicy.  Cute place to visit and ice cream right next door. Parking is fine. Come visit and support the little guy. This is a great alternative to BYT. Prices are good."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick snack just to try the food. Not disappointed at all. I had street tacos with all 3 of the chicken flavors. So good. You can pick you own toppings. Hubby had pork carnitas burrito. It is pretty big and he said delicious. We will be back. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! Rolled tacos and nachos all day! With spicy and VERY HOT sauces"}
{"text":"Holy poop are they good! Lol got the taco salad with red pork and my son did the wet chimi with red pork and they are so delicious!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! The food was unbelievable. There is a new taco shop in the hood and the food is incredibly delicious. Wide variety of meats. Service is sort of a chipotle style.. food was ready in less than less than 5 mins. Price was a little more but way worth it (5 rolled tacos for $10). I would definitely recommend this place, I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My first visit to this new taco shop here in Mesa. I will definitely be back. I tried 5 different flavors on their street tacos. I tried all 3 beef flavors, the chipotle chicken and the basic pork carnitas. After sampling them all I returned for the spiciest beef flavor and bought a 6th taco. Great stuff.

The spiciest beef flavor was the bomb. 

This taco shop has a luchador mask motif, hence the name \"Maskadores\" (Spanish for \"masks\"). The decor is crisp and on theme. The shop is small but fun. The staff is very kind and welcoming.

The shop is a standard taco shop style- you order at the counter and move along the glass counter to choose the toppings. The menu is more than just tacos, though I only tried tacos this time. The staff re-grills the meats as you wait (the meats are cooked already in the counter bins, but they portion them out and regrill them a little for each taco). This is a really nice touch and makes the meat hot and ready to eat.

 I'll be returning to Maskadores soon to try the rest of the menu. So far very good."}
{"text":"Truly authentic! It was some of the best Mexican food that I have been able to find in the East Valley outside of Mexico. The service was great, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere is great for a simple meal. I totally will be going in there quite often now."}
{"text":"We came to Maskadores tonight hoping to expand our repertoire of Mexican food hangouts. It's in a very small space, but the food was good. 

I'm the designated Spice Wimp of the family, but Maskadores allows you to customize your food, so it's easy to leave the spicy stuff out. My husband is the opposite of me in that department, so he was loving everything! They have a good tortilla here which is key to good Mexican food. (In my opinion) I'm sure we will be back to try more menu items. 

The decor is centered around the lucha libre Mexican wrestling culture, and they do a nice job of decorating with the luchadores masks on corrugated siding. They don't have a lot of seating available, so be aware at peak meal times. All in all, it's a decent neighborhood stop."}
{"text":"Really good rolled tacos. Great red pork. Extremely satisfied! Also had the street tacos previously which were a treat as well."}
{"text":"Really good! I had the Bandera Wet Burrito with the chicken tinga. The burrito was definitely big enough to share and is topped with jalapeño cream cheese that is the perfect balance to the red and green sauces that also topped the burrito. They have everything I look for in a burrito place: choice of fillings, a salsa bar, and pickled carrots & jalapeños on said salsa bar. The only negative is that the small dining room was not very clean. (I was there at about 7:15 and assumed I was hitting the end of the dinner rush.) 

As of right now they close at 8. I watched 3 different couples walk in at 7:55, and they were treated just as nicely as I had been 40 minutes earlier. For those of you who haven't worked in food service, that may be the most impressive thing about this place! (If the owner(s) are reading this, I also watched 4 different people try to get in shortly after 8 while I sat in the parking lot and wrote this review. On a Monday.)

Prices are not low. My bill was $11 and change for just the burrito. But it was big, and everything seems fresh and homemade. A couple behind me had various types of street tacos and were pretty enthusiastic about them. I will be back. Oh, and they have horchata!"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT.  I got the fried fish with a carne asada side taco - some of the best in the East Valley.  Clean, quick, SO fresh.  Eat here.  Best of luck!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here, I really enjoyed the authentic flavors of the food, and the atmosphere as well. Service was great, very nice friendly people. They have a great variety of choices.  Food is super hot temperature wise, \"great for take out\"  and very savory.  I would vote this place over most of the taco places around the Mesa area.  Mesa needs places like this!  I will be back for further investigation."}
{"text":"Me & my little guy came over here for a quick mama/son date while big bro had his end of the year party for his church class. I am now super sad because I just found this place & my son's RE classes are done for the semester. Everything was so tasty & fresh. I took a risk & ordered the baja shrimp burrito bowl. You never really know how shrimp will turn out at a new place but they knocked it out of the park. The seasoning was spot on & they were cooked just right. The hot sauces were also nice & spicy. A lot of restaurants down here will call they salsa spicy and not really deliver, not so here. Great for me but maybe a bit much for my \"date\". Over all the atmosphere was creative, everything was super clean, & the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Simple menu but the food is amazing.  We went back for more the next day but went to the Gilbert location.  Food was just as good..."}
{"text":"This place was really good. I'm super picky when it comes to salsas / chiles and this place make them really great and spicy! I'm super happy that they opened a place up like this and hope they get their adobada soon."}
{"text":"Super good food. I had the Quesadilla with chipotle and it can get spicy! but they have less spicy options if you just like flavor! Great salsa selection. Really clean place with cool décor. employees are very helpful and nice. Making this my new lunch spot."}
{"text":"Yo yo yo! This place rocks!! We had their red pork, carne asada, and their marinated chicken and it was SO good. Their jalapeño cream cheese is bomb and their service was great. They just need some logo'd cups so when I take my drink to go everyone knows where I ate!"}
{"text":"I tried the carne asada and spicy chicken tacos! UM YUM! And the orange chipotle sauce is one of my faves. Good flavors & good vibes"}
{"text":"Maskadores just opened in what used to be an America's Taco shop spot. So so much better. Food is amazingly good. I've been in 3 times since they opened and plan to make this a weekly spot. Right on Power road makes it perfect when headed to or from the river or lake.
Spicy Mexican goodness in many forms."}
{"text":"I like this place. It was my first trip here, and there is so much on the menu for me to try --  the number of meat options alone would take me more than a week. I went for the carne asada ranchero, which has jalapeños and onions mixed in and tossed on the grill. 

That is placed into a big tortilla and then you walk down the line Subway-style and fill it up with goodies. I opted for pinto beans and no rice, then onions, cheese, pico and cilantro to finish it off. 

This was nicely rolled and placed on a platter. Not a plate. This burrito is HUGE. Then, it was topped with green and red enchilada sauces on either end and a cream sauce in the middle. Add a dusting of more cheese and ... photo time!

Both sauces had a good kick to them, and the fresh jalapeños inside were very nice. The meat had a bit of crust on it from the brief grilling, which also gave it some extra flavor. I was really happy with my choice and I was glad that I'd had only instant ramen for lunch so that I could finish this monster.

The decor is interesting and they have a soda machine in the corner or a fridge of Jarritos (and maybe other bottled sodas?) -- more flavors than I've even seen at Food City. We watched them make a FRESH batch of chips for nachos and the color looked perfect to me.

Overall, t place was clean, the people making the food and working the register were nice, and the food was good. It might not be the best I've ever had, and I still need to try some other items in the menu, but I'll be back."}
{"text":"We tried the green chili beef in addition to the carne asada this time.  The green chili is really good, but it is pretty spicy.  The guacamole and jalapeno cream cheese are both really good too. They do have chips and guacamole, but it is not on the menu."}
{"text":"Great. I've been looking for a good taco place since I've lived in LA.(not an easy thing to beat). These tacos are amazing. Carne asada all day!"}
{"text":"Finally made it! I will say the shrimp nachos arevreally good I will have to go again to try the tacos"}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked when they opened this spot. Heard some pretty awesome things about it so within a week of opening I stopped by. The location itself is very clean, small and friendly. It's set up more like a chipotle. The lady told me straight up best tacos in mesa... She talked them up pretty good so I ordered a couple tacos and a burrito... I got carne asada, and Barbacoa. Once I got home the tacos were soggy, dry, and the meat was so freaking salty... The carne asada was not carne asada, it was like cubes roast. The only thing I enjoyed was the salsa and the friendliness... Personally, I'll be passing on this place next time!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the flavor and quality of the food. I've had amazing Mexican food and was spoiled by it back home in California. I've come to the conclusion that I'll never be blown away by Mexican food in Arizona. 

Like many of the places i have been to, there's a certain lack of authenticity and culture in the aiding of experience and overall preparation of the food."}
