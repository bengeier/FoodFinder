{"text":"Stumbled upon this place accidentally. It's located in La Fiesta Shopping plaza (in the food court where the huge play gym is located- huge plus for those with kids)  and right across from Carowinds . When they say authentic they mean it. They had fresh salsa and guacamole out for tasting as well as two different types of tamales. I did not taste everything, was rushed but the guacamole was wonderful, fresh and perfectly balanced seasoning and cilantro for a super fresh taste.  They offer all the basics: tacos, burritos, quesadillas,sopas, fajitas, flautas, enchiladas, and more. Lunch menu offers full meals with drink included for 5.99 and aside from regular fountain drinks they have sweet tea and fresh fruit juices like melon, guyaba (guava), and horchata (rice milk). I had the Guava juice and it was perfect, not overly sweet and very fresh. The quesadilla I ordered came out great and I opted for rice and beans (meal normally comes with salad, rice and beans are 1.00 more). It was worth it the rice was excellent and if you like refried beans they were really good also. I'm definitely going again and do recommend for those who love Mexican and want authentic and *fresh*.

{"text":"La Poblanita is a great little Mexican place in the Plaza Fiesta food court.  I went there for lunch recently and had an awesome plate of chicken enchiladas.  They were covered in salsa verde, cheese and slices of avocado.  The tacos also looked delicious and they serve horchata!!  Prices are cheap.

Look for it behind the playland area in the food court."}
{"text":"A great place in a surprising location. The food was beyond what you'd expect from many other inexpensive Mexican restaurants and far above its food court setting. Excellent selection of menu items familiar and different. Great service and tables inside the store front.  Give it a shot."}
{"text":"I love the location of this fantastic (and somewhat secret) taco place: buried inside of the Carolinas' only Latin American-themed mall. The store fronts are designed like Latino market buildings, and there is a lot of different sounds springing from the mall's playplace. This ceiling high structure has a tangling network of tunnels, and if I was younger (and not 6'3?), it'd be fun to navigate.

I had read about La Poblanita, and since I grew up at Carowinds and passed Plaza Fiesta on an almost daily basis, I thought I'd swing in and give it a whirl. $1.75 tacos? The price is on the level of Taco Bell, the flavors are a world away. Corn tortillas, radish slices, and thick cilantro make these some of the best tacos I've had in the Charlotte area.

The lengua (tongue) is like a tender pot roast, with a little less moisture (ironic?). The red sauce was a lot stronger and saltier, so I didn't use it much for the taco with sharp radishes and light lime and cilantro flavors. The green salsa was a pleasant surprise with much more kick than a tomatillo salsa.

The menu is pretty big, and I'll be asking for more recommendations the next time I go. There are plenty of authentic Mexican sodas in fun flavors, like Jarritos or Toronja (a grapefruit soda).

I've got more tacos to try and horchata to sip. Or gulp."}
{"text":"greatly priced. my favorite dish is LENGUA TACOS!!!! the best in Charlotte. i love La Poblanita!!!! try the sopes too!!!!! yum."}
{"text":"The other reviews are spot on.  This is in a food court at Plaza Fiesta, a Latin themed mall (the old Crossroads Outlet Mall) next to Carowinds.  Regardless of the location, the food is fresh and delicious.  You can see them making their own tortillas and nothing comes from a can - not even the beans.  The avocado is amazing.  The menu is in Spanish and English, so you should be okay when ordering, though they may call your order number in Spanish.  Oh, Mexican Coca-Cola too!"}
{"text":"This place was a shock given it is located in a mall food court right next to the tourist mecca of Carowinds.  This is Mexican food more authentic than can be found in the burbs of San Diego.  The menu has limited English so you need to be careful less you order unwanted animal parts (tripe, tongue etc).  This is the real deal, a truly great cheap taco shop on the NC/SC border."}
{"text":"A friend of mine, who happens to be Hispanic, brought me tacos from this place...they were stone cold by the time they arrived but I was at work and starving so I didn't bother to heat them...they were foot stomping, mouth watering, DELICIOUS.  I was so impressed I immediately sent my husband a text and told him \"ROAD TRIP this weekend!\"

The restaurant is in Plaza Fiesta, a market place located right across from Carowinds.  It's nothing fancy...you walk up to a counter and order.  The menu is totally authentic...and in both Spanish and English.

Because we're total gluttons, my familiy of four ordered a taco assortment (four tacos---with assorted meats, onions, and cilantro), an enchilada platter, two different tamales, chips and queso and three different drinks (one melon and one pineapple).  We ate it all...every last bite...and it was FABULOUS.  

There's no real \"service\"...you order at the counter, are given a number and you pick it up when your number is called.  It's a no frills little joint but none of that really matters...the food is so rockin' good you won't want to be interrupted.

If you love Mexican food,  you owe it to yourself to try this place."}
{"text":"Wow, who would have expected this gem in a mall food court?   I finally was able to check out Plaza Fiesta and heard that the food court here was great so I decided to eat here.  The other Yelp reviews led me to La Poblanita.

For a food court option, the menu here is extensive, just like you would find at a sit-down Mexican place.  You have your normal fajitas, tacos, burritos etc and lunch specials.

Since I was new here, I asked the order taker to give me recommendations and she pointed me to the tortas and sopas.  She recommended the sopa with chorizo and chipotle chicken so I ordered on of each.

A sopa is like a deep fried corn tortilla cake.  It's thicker than a tortilla and it's made in-house.  It comes topped with your meat of choice, lettuce, and other fresh options.  Actually the flavors were amazing!  You know the food is good when the flavors linger in your mouth several minutes after you eat.

The salsas here are also flavorful and spicy, just the way I like them.

The only fault is with the rice and beans.  Nothing special there.

I definitely need to come back here.  I am always down in this area to get gas and I work close so it may be a new lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"OMG, this place is freakin awesome. I am here at least twice a week for lunch and generally order either the sopes or tostadas (with steak or chorizo as my protein). Place is just out of this world. every thing is home made (including the nachos and stuff) and their salsa is to die for. Highly reccomended!"}
{"text":"Well, it was a mixed bag on my first visit to La Poblanita.  I stopped in and asked for an order of chicken soft tacos on corn tortillas, a pork tamale, and a regular horchata.

It took maybe 6-7 minutes for my order to be prepared and my number was called and I went up to grab my bag.  First the good:  the horchata was terrific.  I ordered the regular because I thought the large was priced a little high at $2.50.  I was wrong.  The large is well worth the price and I'll get it when I go back.  The tamale was excellent.  It was a little light on the filling, but it had a really great flavor and was a bargain at $1.50.

So when I order food to go, I've had enough good experiences that I don't ever bother to check to make sure I was given what I ordered.  That practice burnt me today.  My tacos were neither chicken, nor soft.  They were ground beef and they were hard.  Sigh.  If either of the other two items I ordered were bad, I might have gone back.  But I didn't.  I ate them.  They were okay.  I wouldn't get them again though.  Too much other fun stuff on the menu.  Like tamales!  And horchata!"}
