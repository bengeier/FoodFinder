{"text":"This family-run restaurant may not look like much, but it has the best Chinese food and the best vegetarian food I've ever had. The ingredients are varied -- most times I'm not even sure what the ingredients are -- and the flavours of each dish are unique and fresh. Try the \"olive-leaf fried rice\" together with the \"eggplant and tofu in black bean sauce\" and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"I am a forever fan of Simon's Wok on Gerrard. I have been coming to this place on and off for the past 4 years and it never disappoints.  I don't understand all the bad reviews this place is getting.   It is true, the decor is very bland, hole in the wall kind of resto. But I ask you to get past that and just try their food.  They have wonderful lunch specials that you can share with your best food buddy. There's so much food, you won't be able to finish it yourself.   The sweet and sour 'mock' fish is so delicious. It's so funny because it is actually shaped like a fish.   They have a huge assortment of fried rice dishes and fried noodles. My favorite is the one with the cashews.  They also have one of the best assorted gluten appetizers. It's cold and it has everything in one plate. From sweet, sweet and soury, curry-y, to crunchy and soft. YUM.  I have never gotten sick from eating at this place. Always had to pop a button or two after the meal.   The service can improve. Little bit on the slow side."}
{"text":"Very small family run restaurant... with not much uniqueness of dishes. Ordered many \"different\" foods just to find out that they were all the same as in they used the same sauce in every dish and stir fried everything. The only significant difference i could see was they they used different vegetables... other than that... they all tasted the same. A LOT of MSG was also used in their foods which made my mother sick. I will definetly not be going back. Worst Vegetarian Experience."}
{"text":"What a gem. The food is delicious and service is great. Do bring cash, they don't take credit or debit."}
{"text":"Simon's Wok is awesome!  Sure the decor is dated and the service can sometimes be a wee bit abrupt, but the food more than makes up for it in taste, portion size and price.  The hot and sour soup is amazing, the 'small' is actually quite a large bowl of delicious spiciness for only $3.50!  This could easily be eaten as a meal by itself.  My favourite is the Sweet and Sour Mock Pork, a huge portion of crispy, chewy 'pork' balls with big chunks of green pepper, mushrooms and pineapple.  The sauce is a perfect blend of sweet and sour.    Pour it over one of their great fried rice dishes (I recommend the veggie chicken with pineapple) and you've got a feast for 2 with leftovers for lunch the next day. Yum!!!  With this much great food for only $23 with tax and tip, how can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Don't let the decor and location take you away from this hidden gem.  Can convert carnivores into vegans.  Clean and efficient service. Quality ingredients. Great price and always leaving fulfilled.  Everything i've tried has been sooo good and piping hot from a wok. I personally recommend olive rice, fried taro with sweet and sour sauce, seaweed soup, mushroom anything and sweet purple rice with coconuts.     Kudos.."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but for a nice change up I go to Simons for the mock duck and veggies.  Pretty good for no meat.  Inexpensive. Writing down your order for them on a piece of paper is kinda weird, but thar ya go."}
{"text":"if I could kiss Simon I would. he is wonderful man with a wonderful establishment and many treats to be discovered on his tantalizing menu.  vegans and vegetarians rejoice in the streets at the 5 dollar lunch special.   and God bless Simon"}
{"text":"Family run. Delish! Try the faux duck for sure."}
{"text":"Best veggie place in the City!  Feels like you are in WanChai. Great service, great menu!"}
{"text":"Love the gluten appetizer!  Didn't feel like I was eating a ball of grease or msg, like some of the other Chinese veg places in Markham.  Very refreshing.  Also good was the stir fry snow pea shoots.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Chinese vegetarian restaurant when balancing price and quality.  The portion sizes are decent, the prices are reasonable, and the service is fast.  They have assorted gluten and a delicious variety of mock meats."}
{"text":"I don't understand the four stars for this place?! We ordered the following and nothing was good about them.  - Seaford fried noodles is very small portion and very bland tasting  - veg goose was cold and dry  - sweet and sour soup has no taste to it (not sour or hot...just taste like a starch soup) - bitter melon fried  rice  noodles was extremely oily (swimming in oil) and the bitter melon taste like it was frozen before  - bean curd roll was too oily and only had a little carrot filling  Only positive thing was that the staff was friendly.  Would definitely recommend elsewhere and not go back."}
{"text":"It's not the fanciest place but the staff are friendly and efficient, they make delicious vegetarian food (lots of mock meat), and their prices are super affordable (under $10 for most entres, around $5 for apps/soups).  I've ordered a lot of items on their menu and the ones that really stand out are: (1) beef and broccoli (2) shrimp/seafood (3) mock duck.  I usually order more than I can eat and bring a doggy bag home. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Simon's Wok is one of my favourite restaurants for great homey, unpretentious Chinese vegetarian food.  Definite must try dishes include the deep fried king mushroom, black mushroom with broccoli, vegetarian deluxe, szechuan shrimp, fried \"eel\" with seaweed and any of their fried noodle dishes.  They also have the best gluten platter I have ever had.  The soups and soup noodles are a bit bland as is the stuffed bean curd roll and vegetarian chicken appetizer.  Service is very friendly and efficient and the prices can't be beat.  Washrooms are down a flight of rather steep and creaky stairs ... they are clean but a bit sketchy, not uncommon in basements of older buildings."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years and it never gets old. Love the mock fish and chicken fried rice and mock goose. Definitely check this place out. Amazing prices, great quality food, and the owner is frequently there - sometimes even in the kitchen, a huge treat."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple items from the menu. The food was good.  Not amazing, but great for the price that you pay.   I would go back to try a few more items.  Maybe a couple of the \"regular\" chinese dishes"}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese restaurant in town! (I'm vegetarian). I love the mock goose and their deep fried king mushroom."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive Chinese Vegetarian. The setting is not fancy but everything is clean and the service is efficient if not overly coddling. Equal mix of local Chinese and local gwai lo. Try the eggplant hot pot, the Shanghai fried rice cakes (I think that is what they're called), the stir fried snow pea shoots. The sweet and sour dishes were well balanced but quite sweet, although I have a low tolerance for sugar. The hot and sour soup is fantastic with the addition of a bit more vinegar. We never pay more than $40 for two including tax and tip and always leave stuffed and with leftovers.  I suspect there is MSG involved in this equation :)"}
{"text":"I was here twice in one week, after recently trying this place.  Oddly, I have to say I'm a big fan of the fake roasted duck appetizer.  I ordered a pineapple chicken fried rice and rice noodles with fake beef.  Both were good, my more adventurous orders were less impressive.  My bf had me ordering some 3 mushroom dish.  all in all, it was really good, and will end up in our regular rotation of places to eat."}
{"text":"i strolled over to simons wok for a late lunch at about 3 pm, a half hour past their five dollar lunch special window.  i was the only customer in the restaurant, and were still serving the special.  as i waited for this surprise special to come out (i dont think there was a choice what you could get;  they made the same for everyone.)  i sat at a table beside the front window, facing inwards towards the kitchen while one of the waitresses was just finishing to mop the floor.    shortly after i sat down they brought me a teapot with the standard chinese restaurant tea - whatever that may be - but it was much need and fine by me.    that need was further quenched by the first stage to arrive as part of the unknown meal.  the soup was a sweet corn and tofu soup.  its consistency was thick and kind of gluey and frankly snotty looking.  but im sure weve all seen chinese food that is not appetizing at first, second and third sight but mighty tasty when you eat it.  and so it was.  i put some soy sauce and a little hot sauce on it for a bit of the white mans spicing preferences and finished the bowl clean.  next was a gorgeous plate of freshly stir fried vegetables with that soft tofu that looks like its been wrapped in a glistening paper bag if that makes any sense.  it was flavourful and again warranted the extra sauce choices.    coupled with a small bowl of rice, this dish and the soup left me with no space left for food and i was all the better for it.  i will come again for sure, and perhaps update this review, because i think this place tries to make itself known for more innovative vegetarian dishes where you can get faux duck, beef, seafood, etc. and id like to give that a go.  what i had was good, nothing extraordinary, but good nonetheless.  keep in mind that they only take cash and might prepare snow peas for future dishes at a table in the back of the restaurant as you eat your meal, so if you are allergic to that type of experience then..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for YEARS. Well over a decade. It's not fabulous, but it's consistently good. For reliable, fresh, vegan food prepared quickly, it can't be beat. Our favourites include the 'duck' with broccoli, the 'eel', and the green bean noodles."}
{"text":"Simon's Wok is hands down my favourite restaurant in Toronto. I have ordered from them a countless number of times and they have never disappointed... except the soups. They are okay but need more seasoning. I won't hold it against them though. I still get them from time to time!  My favourites are:  - salt & pepper mushrooms (only in restaurant) - spring rolls - vegetarian \"duck\" - vegetaria \"goose\" - assorted gluten platter - stuffed bean curd sheets - any of their fried rice - mock sweet and sour \"pork\" - fried \"eel\" - vegetarian \"duck\" with vegetables - vegetarian \"seafood\" with vegetables - \"beef\" satay - tofu and tomatoes on rice - fried rice noodles  ... and more... I love Simon's!   I still don't understand why they don't get more love from the vegetarian community. They're great! Go give them some love (and business)!"}
{"text":"Been craving some vegetarian food and this place popped up during my search so literally went out of my way to come here. Don't expect an amazing atmosphere or anything - a typical run down Asian restaurant. The washroom is downstairs past this creepy hallway but it was relatively clean. The lady that served us was very polite and friendly and the service itself was quite fast, keep in mind that we were basically the only customers in the restaurant so I can't say anything about the speed when it gets busier.   Now, the food. The flavours were pretty good. We got the house special fried noodle and I realized enjoyed that. We also got a duck dish which looked and tasted nothing like duck and everything like tofu, which I didn't mind but felt like the marketing was pretty deceiving.   Overall, it's a nice place that I'd come back again if I were closeby."}
{"text":"Vegetarian food doesn't have to be fancy or pretentious.  Simon's Wok has been around for many years and is hidden at the far end of Toronto's Chinatown east (that's the smaller Chinatown).  It has been over 10 years since my last visit to Simon's Wok, and it's as if the prices have not changed.  Almost every dish is $5-$9 and is a good portion.    I'm always recommending this place to friends, but I understand their apprehensiveness.  Firstly, it's vegetarian and most non-vegetarians balk at the idea and secondly, the place looks like crap.  It's small, it's dark, and it looks like you just shouldn't be there.  Hopefully you can get over this little minor issue and try it out.  I know that if Simon's Wok were closer to me I'd adopt vegetarianism more often.  My aim is to go back in less than 10 years though!"}
{"text":"It's authentic Chinese food at a great price. I order everything in Cantonese when I'm here, as the staff is very friendly, attentive and helpful if you're feeling indecisive.  The fried rice and olive leaves is one of my favourite dishes here. And make sure you try the deep-fried king mushrooms ($12). The batter makes it taste amazing!  4.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but that really doesn't matter at this joint. It's all about the noodles and fresh vegetables. They do make a variety of vegetarian protiens like duck, shrimp and beef and they're pretty good. But the real hero is the seasoning and the sauces. I especially like the soups. My favourite dish is they're version of Singapore noodles, Also they mixed veg and noodles. Great place.   Bring cash, there's no debit."}
{"text":"It's a bit of a hole in the wall,but the food's a magnet,attracting  a diverse group of diners within the hour or so I had lunch.As of this review,their meat substitutes have wheat,caution for those who have sensitivities. BEWARE,Simon's Wok is cash only.Not happy to find out post arrival and ordering since there's NO warning on the menu,restaurant walls."}
{"text":"pretty good service.  pretty good food.    the thing is that if this is the kind of food you want (chinese vegetarian), short of going to markham, you really don't have much choice in downtown toronto."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot of great things about Simon's Wok. My friends have described it as a vegetarian restaurant with a chef that has the skills to make vegetarian ingredients taste like meat! How cool is that?! So I got a bunch of friends together, and made the trek over for dinner.  The Good  I was able to make a reservation for 12 people easily - though we were the only guests in the restaurant for 90% of our meal The prices are very reasonable - most dishes under $10 - 6 of us shared about 6 dishes, three desserts and two drinks and the total was about $15 per person with tax and tip Service was efficient Food was tasty, if not a little on the salty side with all the soy sauce used Conveniently located - streetcar stop right in front of the restaurant Menu available online Green tea was free and regularly refilled Most drinks are $1 (pop, milk and juice)  The Not So Good  Every item that was supposed to taste like meat tasted like egg and tofu. But then again, IT WAS egg and tofu. I don't know how people tasted anything else You purchase the rice separately Found the food to be on the salty side No liquor license for those that like their liquor Would I return?  No. There are plenty of Chinese restaurants in my area that serve very similar dishes for similar prices. Why make the trek?"}
{"text":"Don't let the very ordinary exterior of this restaurant fool you: the food is amazing, and the place is clean and casual in the best way possible. The people who come here are clearly in the know about what a gem this is. Portions are generous (especially for the price), and everything is shareable; those little bowls are very convenient. The Arhat style fried noodles have a nice smoky overtone, with just the right amount of crunch (bean sprouts) and flavor (some pickled veggies in the mix). I especially liked the seaweed and bean curd soup, and the black sesame mochi made for an interesting, flavorful desert. Service is unobtrusive, which adds to the relaxed ambience."}
{"text":"Delicious food, including mock meats. Unpretentious setting (ie, hole in the wall), with friendly service and excellent prices!"}
{"text":"The place is one of my favourite Chinese vegetarian places because it is so centrally located. Located on the south side of Gerrard street just a little east of Logan the place is a little hole in the wall. It sits by itself the only restaurant in the area. It is a simple square box with a few square tables and two bigger round tables. The staff hang out at the back of the restaurant always eager for customers. Everything about the place is bare and spartan, except for the food, which is always delicious. The menus, laminated place mats have a selection of Chinese vegetarian options and a small sheet of specials. There are appetizers, soups, casseroles, main dishes, noodle dishes and rice dishes. We ordered the hot and sour soup, some deep fried mushrooms, ginger eggplant, sweet and sour pork, curry gluten, MaPo tofu and Shanghai noodles. Everything arrived hot and delicious with way more food than we needed. But one of the joys of such places is the sheer quantity of food that arrives. We enjoyed all the dishes, especially the deep fried mushrooms which are always yummy fried salty nibbles, but found the MaPo tofu too watery and bland."}
{"text":"i have been coming here for years and years.    surprisingly this staple in east chinatown has survived... while the neighborhood seems to be declining in new successful restaurants.    Their food is good.  Any chow mein you get will taste the same but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Since they use to thicker noodles to make the crispy chow mein, this makes it taste very good.  Every single time i go i would have to order their fried beancurd roll with carrots and mushrooms in the middle.  It is simple the best here.    Unfortunately a huge downfall for this place is the serving size of the food.. Portions have shrank in size significantly over the years while the prices have gone up slightly.  I never expect a bargain when eating vegetarian Chinese food however, the serving size is almost to the point where i question if i will be full after leaving the restaurant.  Something to think about...."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for vegetarians and Chinese food lovers. The food is so healthy and they go light on the oil - which makes my stomach happy. Last night we had the Eggplant bean curd black bean hot pot (they call it casserole), the curried vermicelli  and the chinese broccoli. It was a very delicious and satisfying meal for under $25. I'm not into mock meat and there are so many options that you can avoid it if you like. The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because the decors is a bit down-market but that is also part of the charm."}
