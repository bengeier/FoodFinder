{"text":"The best \"breakfast\" place. Best food and service and prices and hours. Full menu anytime. (I only dream they had booths and kept the temperature more comfortable)."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, great tasting food, no wait to be seated (even during peak times), quick service, and cheap prices. This is my go-to spot. Whoever doesn't rate this place five stars is a classic 'yelp snob'."}
{"text":"Very snowy day and we braved the elements to come here!

Ordered the pancake combo and the Sunlight signature combo.  

Sign on door (who knows how long it's been there) says they currently don't accept debit or credit cards due to some fee debate with their bank.  ATM on site if you don't have cold hard cash.

It's a casual seat yourself place.  Service is friendly and the food is great!  The eggs were cooked perfectly, not greasy, nice homestyle crispy fried potatoes, and great big fluffy pancakes.  Bottomless cup of coffee.  Must come back and try the souvlaki dinners too!"}
{"text":"Good price super fast breakfast unfortunately eggs were cold ,bacon very salty ,but the staff is very friendly its a new business , I will try again"}
{"text":"Had my first breakfast experience here today. Loved it, it was everything I was looking for. Fast and efficient service, friendly staff, the food was exactly what you expect, no surprises and it was hot and ready within minutes. As a seasoned server myself with over ten years experience in diner style restaurants as well as being currently employed as a supervisor/bartender/server at a major corporate chain I can say this place is gonna make it. I've lived in the area my whole life and have always wanted a place like this nearby and now my wish has come true. I will definitely go back to try some of their fresh homemade dinner specials. Really intrigued by homemade beef stew Mondays, yum!"}
{"text":"This is a classic all day breakfast place. Its usually not too full on the weekends, and the food comes pretty quick. I wouldn't say the food is to die for but for the prices you pay for the meal, you can't really complain. I usually go for the big breakfast with pancakes eggs, sausage, bacon and potato hash.  For a quick and easy breakfast this is the place to go."}

The service is very quick and friendly.
Prices are amazing for the large portions of food you get.

Food is standard diner fare for the most part. I tend to get breakfast, no matter what time of day we eat there. You must try the meat lovers skillet if you want to be full for the better part of a day. Enjoy!"}
