{"text":"We decided to give this place a try tonight.  We were having a birthday party at our house for my son and this place is close by.  We ordered two pizzas and when my husband went in to pick up the pizza, they charged our credit card and then proceeded to inform him they didn't make our pizza because they ran out of cheese.  Sorry, I can't rate the actual food since we never got any.  We will not attempt to order from this place ever again."}
{"text":"We have looked far and wide for good pizza and finally found it here!"}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and tastes great.  We ordered the southwest salad and avocado pizza and they were sooooo good. The manager was very nice and helpful, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had. Cheesy but not greasy like Angela Mia with lots of options. Wings are great too."}
{"text":"We order from here at least once a week, sometimes twice if I feel lazy and don't want to cook dinner....The gluten free pizza is the best gf pizza we've had from any restaurant. They have the biggest gf menu out of anyplace that I'm aware of; they have tapioca burger buns, gf fried cheese, sub buns, and they even offer lactose-free cheese. Their gf turtle cheesecake is AMAZING. Oh, and I don't think it's on the menu but they always let us order gf loaded fries and potato skins, they just cook them in the gf fryer instead of the regular one. Their regular menu has a lot of different things that most delivery places don't offer (ribs that friends have told me are great, battered/fried veggies). Everything I've ever had there is awesome. 

One thing to note is that their regular pizza sauce is on the sweet side. We don't really care for sweet sauces but they also use their wing sauces for pizzas if you'd like. My personal favorite is the spicy garlic sauce and my husband likes regular garlic butter. I'm sure the sauce is fine for anyone who likes it a little sweeter, that's just not our thing. 

Since we have diet restrictions, we tend to have to change a lot of things on our orders (no bacon on potato skins, certain sauces on the side, etc) and our order is always correct and the delivery people are always either on time or early and friendly. 

Basically we just love love love this place and can't say enough great things about them.

**They also have gluten free fish dinners and sandwiches for lent!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and tried the pizza.  Very good!  Excellent value.  Would request a little more sauce next time.  And I will definitely try it again."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have been here. Good pizza. I gave only 4 stars because of the service. I ordered online and it said 20 minutes. I got there and I had to wait 10 extra minutes. 30 minutes total waiting in reality. But overall I was satisfied."}
{"text":"THE BEST. Revolution pizza is the best pizza place in Lake County. And the prices on everything are excellent. I love their $5 deal. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 of there $5 1 topping pizzas for a quick lunch today and the quality and quantity of pizza that you get for $5 is unbelievable.  I would not even consider any of those other $5 pizza deals after having revolution pizza.  There was a perfect amount of topping, cheese and sauce. All of which tasted nice and fresh, the cheese was gooey and had that amazing cheese pull to it. The sauce is a little on the sweeter side which i like, the crust is lite and airy with a kind of al dente noodle bite to the crust not crispy.  The service is very fast and friendly.  This will be my new fast grab pizza place when i need lunch fast, cheap and delucious."}
{"text":"The store front itself is a mini hole in the wall, but by all means do NOT let that deter you.  I called in to place my carry out order and was greeted by a very friendly individual.  He helped me navigate my order and their options.  That is to say, I knew I wanted a gluten free pizza with chicken and tomato; however, i did not know that they had gf options like square vs. round pizza.  For the novelty of it all, I had to go for the square version ( a luxury which i have not enjoyed in probable 10 years).  Next I asked about gf dessert options.  The helpful man on the phone indicated there were multiple options including a peanut butter cake, lemon bar, brownie and at least another few options.  Really I stopped listening after \"peanut butter cake.\"  The price was reasonable and they indicated the order would be ready in 15 minutes.
As stated before the store front is rather unassuming; however, it is easily visible from the road and has abundant parking.  I was basically greeted at the door by two employees.  One of them, I assume the one I spoke to on the phone, made me feel secure by doing a mini pointing maneuver paired with the spoken phrase: \" gluten free, right?\"  He smiled and quickly got my order.  The entire transaction took maybe 5 minutes.  
Once home, I dug in to a slightly thick, soft but crispy crust with perfectly melted cheese and well cooked toppings.  The pizza itself brought forth memories of childhood regular pizza experiences and it was glorious.  The peanut butter cake was rich, moist and tasty.  No contamination issues.  100% recommend and its the best gluten free pizza I have had in years."}
{"text":"Great place to pick up a cheap delicious pizza for lunch. Call and give a little notice and it will be fresh and ready. To there for a pepperoni pizza almost once a week. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I order from Revolution Pizza weekly because it's just around the block from me.  But I love this place!  The staff is really friendly and I never have to wait more than 20 minutes for my food.  I have had better pizza, but it's better than most, and at the price they charge, I haven't found anything better.  Awesome staff, and great value is why I'm giving it 5 stars. :)"}
{"text":"I went to the original Revolution Ale House in NoDa the weekend before and was so blown away by the food that I had to try this place. Luckily, I found a Groupon here that gave me more reason to check it out. While not quite as good as the the Ale House in NoDa, this place is pretty darn good. The pizzas are the same size, and about $4-$5 cheaper (smalls $8-$9 vs $12-13). They'll let you do half and half if you want to try two different ones. 

I'd definitely recommend the garlic knots with any trip here ... some of the best I've had! 

I wouldn't recommend a salad ... we got a small Cesar and it was the smallest salad ever and costs $4."}
{"text":"The pizza is not good. Little Ceasers or Georgios has better pizza than this place. I would not eat their pizza if it was the only place open on a night that I'm highly intoxicated and need something greasy to sober me up."}
{"text":"We're always willing to try a pizzaria once and we're glad we tried Revolution! The Buffalo chicken pizza in particular is great. They have LOTS of gluten free options. The customer service is never disappointing. 

The only thing I don't like is that their standard sauce is a little sweet. But they have other options which are listed on the menu. 

If you haven't tried Revolution I urge you to do so!"}
{"text":"Just got news that Revolution is now offering all of their sandwiches and burgers gluten free. They are also putting in a dedicated gluten free fryer for deep fried tasties... Celiacs and gluten intolerants need some deep fried love, too!

Nom?"}
{"text":"Tonight I was looking at yelp to find a good new pizza place to try I noticed revolution pizza it had all good reviews so I went ahead and ordered when I called I encountered a rude girl who was too busy worry about what was going on around her surroundings then listening to me give her my credit card number. One hour past and  no pizza wings or Loaded  Fries I called back to see  where's my food a guy yelled in the background very rudely said it's on its way it'll get there When I got the food I open it up it was hot. The pizza does taste okay but it is lacking in sauce the cheesy fries although were a greasy mess with some kind of sour cream/mozzarella cheese splattered on top of it with no to little bacon the wings look like they were Fried  in a fryer And just had sauce poured on them they did not even take the time to properly shake them like other places do my entire order came to $23 but I can honestly tell you first impressions are the most important impressions this place did not  make a good first impression therefore I will take my business somewhere else next time"}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. We called in for a pizza (2 be delivered). Website says 30 minutes. 40 minutes goes by, a manager calls, says it'll be closer to an hour. We say, no thanks. He says, he'll call us right back. An hour goes by, no call, no pizza. We try calling. The phone is busy. Two hours goes by, no call, no pizza. Credit card was charged. We try again at 9 pm, they're CLOSED. Terrible. Never using again."}
{"text":"The space was not renovated from the previous incarnation of the restaurant.  The pizza was fresh.  Heating it up the next day the ricotta was even better than the previous night's meal.  It's a  small space that seems to be hang out for high school & college students so beware the small space can get noisy when the kids are in the house"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple weeks ago and just repeated. The thin New York style pizza was really good. For the first time in forever I ordered with just cheese. Tonight EXTRA EXTRA mushroom and again an order of wings.

Nothing to in-depth to say here. The pizza was really good and not greasy. The sauce has a nice tang without being to sweet. The wings were plump, well done and again not greasy or fatty.

Polite helpful staff and on-time delivery."}
{"text":"Been missing out for years.. Place is right up the street from where I live. Must get the garlic parmesan sticks- way better than crazy bread. I could eat 2 orders easily. These bundles of goodness are covered in cheese and garlic butter sauce!! OMG! Im in love! Pizza is pretty darn good too.. for me it's all about the sauce. 2 thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I'd actually give this 3.5 maybe 4 stars. My food has always been tasty and hot when delivered but the 45-60min delivery time a bit annoying. Especially when I'm only 5mins away.. So often I will cut the time in 1/2 and go pick it up!"}
{"text":"Used to do laundry next door to this place and couldn't help but notice how many people were constantly flocking in and out, as well as how many times the delivery people got sent out. It has to be good right? Right. I finally decided to give Revolution Pizza a try and I was not disappointed. 

With new pizza places, I like to order a plain cheese pizza to get a feel for them. It was delicious, super hot when I got it, and the prices were great! I started to order a small pizza, but there was an awesome deal to upgrade to a medium for only 99 cents, so I took it. 

In conclusion, I've decided that if I'm craving really good pizza and don't want to spend a lot of money, I'll be going to Revolution."}
{"text":"Revolution Pizza replaced the recently closed Pizza Fusion in the Metropolitan. It is difficult to tell since they kept nearly everything; same furniture, layout, paint, and even some of the window decals. One of the few things they didn't keep was the Boylan's soda station. I use to go to Pizza Fusion solely for that delicious soda!

My BBQ chicken pizza was good. The pizza is slightly improved from the Pizza Fusion days. I felt a bit uncomfortable being the only one in the place on a Saturday afternoon. They need to bring back the sidewalk chalkboard, improve awareness, and build their new identity."}
{"text":"I placed an online order for delivery, but the website never asked for my address. It has been 45 mins, my card has been charged, and no one is answering the phone..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza on the east side. 
The woman on the phone was very helpful and nice when it came to ordering. I ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and buffalo wings. The pizza was huge and delicious. And the wings were great; not too much sauce and not too dry. She said they would be here within the hour, and they definitely made that happen. Definitely worth checking into if you are on the market for great pizza and wings! They also have a great gluten free menu!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to give a shout-out to Revolution Pizza on my Facebook page and, since it showed up on a search, I'm taking the opportunity...mainly because I want them to have lots of business so they never leave my area.  The pizza is very good, with tasty sauce, perfect crust, and generous toppings.  I always order extra sauce, though. Their wings are great...good-sized, cooked perfectly, and with many styles and flavors to choose from. Our favorite is garlic barbecue.  Delicious sauce with lots of chopped garlic all over them.  We always try to turn our family and friends on to these!  Should try other menu offerings, but we love the pizza and wings so much that we get a lot of it for leftovers as it is!  The staff is always very friendly and accommodating, and the prices are quite reasonable."}
{"text":"Love there pizza and the sauce is the best!! We have gotten wings, gluten free pizza too."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for me, I've tried them three different times, and I find their pizza too soggy to eat."}
{"text":"I was suprized that this was so good. I expected it to be ok, but it reason really really good. And as a good price.  Will absolutely order from here again."}
{"text":"I have tried Revolution pizza few times. There's something about the pizza crust and the sauce that you keep wanting more. The topping combinations are out of box.

The wings are really good. They are not shy in the sauce. Nice crunchy yet moist and juicy. We had garlic wings and teriyaki wings.

Gluten free is offered but I go for the real thing. 

Definitely need to try this pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a delivery last week and we weren't disappointed. We got 2 pizzas, boneless wings, and a slice of peanut butter chocolate cake. The pizzas were great. One was a specialty pizza, the big Texas meat or something. It was good too much meat variety for my tastes but hubby liked it. (But it doesn't make it a bad pie, just not for me). We ordered hot ranch boneless wings. The flavor wasn't what we were expecting at all. They were literally boneless wings tossed in hot sauce with ranch drizzled over, so hot ranch haha not a specialty sauce. We were just expecting something different there. Now the PB chocolate cake. First off our delivery driver forgot it at the store. Not good she honestly could have just given us our money back but she was so sweet and went back to the store and brought it right over. She was back probably quicker than 10 mins later so problem fixed! Now the taste of this cake. It wasn't horrible, but I'm not going to order that again. I don't think it was home made, it was cut in a perfect square. Which is fine i just didn't like the cake it was kinda dry and I was expecting a whipped type frosting but it was more like a layer of PB and chocolate ganache. But halfway thru I noticed the writing on the box it said GF. Maybe that explains the taste, I don't normally eat gluten free so i couldn't tell how good/bad it can be. But since they do have an extensive GF menu this probably gives them an upper hand in the pizza industry. We will probably order again."}
{"text":"Possibly the best calzone I've ever eaten. Excellent pricing for what you get. Friendly staff who definitely deserve five stars.

I will definitely be returning in the future to try out their other menu items.

Only downside is they're built for carry out so I'd recommend ordering ahead and eating elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice people. Good pie. Very reasonable on the wallet. My wife has a sensitivity to gluten, so the tasty GF menu is very appreciated. $5 cheese 8-cut everyday, how can you go wrong with that?? I work close to there so if I don't have a lunch from home I will almost always hit up revolution pizza for my meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Revolution Pizza is fantastic!  I've had a few gluten-free pizzas from here and they have all been delicious -- best I've had in the city.  Their gluten-free appetizers list is the longest I've seen in the city -- fried cheese?!

And they give you a free gluten-free dessert with your order!  WHAT!  A restaurant that seems to sympathize with your gluten-free plight?!

Amazing customer service, and the guy behind the counter (owner? employee?) is very nice.  I hope this place stays around for a while."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Lake County. The cheese is perfectly cooked on the pizza and just makes your mouth water!! The wings are very good with a lot of sauce. They are not very pricey either, great value compared to other places around. The gluten free menu is cool. I haven't tried it yet but I think I'm going to the next time I go just to say I did. I introduced my parents to this place when they came over once and now whenever we have pizza, even if it's all the way at their house, they want me to pick up revolution. 

Very friendly people who work there. I definitely recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, hands down the best pizza joint in willowick on rare occasion the dough is a bit meh, but I would recommend them. Great staff delivery drivers are awesome me and friendly this is my joint in willowick.
I like the delivery drivers they got character"}
{"text":"And the search for good pizza in Charlotte continues...  

I figured there was No Way that the pizza could be worse that the dog shit served by the prior pizzeria that occupied this this spot - Pizza Fusion.  And no, it wasn't as bad as the pie that I threw away from Pizza Fusion but I was expecting a lot more given that I've some good experiences at Revolution Pizza's NoDa location.  First off, Revolution NoDa is known for its beer selection.  This location had to suds to quench my thirst, so I decided to be my pie to go.  Upon opening the box, I found the pie to be greasy, doughy, and generally undercooked.  It was as though the oven was not hot enough, or it was not cooked for long enough.  It's not like the place was anywhere even close to full, so it's not like they needed to rush cook my pie. I had to fire up my oven at home and through the pie in there for a bit to get it cooked through. Ridiculous.  

I drove by Rev Pizza this weekend and it looks like it has already closed.  Not a surprise.  Evidently I'm not the only one who thought it sucked schweatty balls."}
{"text":"After searching yelp for a new pizza place we came across Revolution and they had some really good reviews so we decided to order takeout. We got the family meal deal that was posted on their website (12 cut specialty, 8 cut cheese pizza, 12 wings, cheesy bread, and a 2 liter of coke) and it was AMAZING! We got the Chicago stuffed crust which was very yummy and even the cheese pizza was great!! The wings were perfectly crispy (no soggy, droopy wings here!) and the sauce was good. They were super nice on the phone and in person, the price was great for a lot of food and honestly the only thing that would've made it better (for me, hubby doesn't agree lol) is a side salad. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Revolution Pizza replaced Pizza Fusion in the Met.  The pizza quality and menu is similar, but there are some small changes.  One of the positive changes is the garlic knots.  Usually garlic knots are pretty similar, but these are soft and flaky with a delicious garlic sauce.  I definitely recommend ordering these.

The pizza itself is pretty good with the right expectations.  The ingredients are high quality, but the pizza overall is not traditional NY style, which is not always a bad thing, depending on what you are looking for.  The price for the pizza is pretty high, though, which is always my main hesitation from ordering pizza from here.

One thing take note of, is that the store tends to close early on weekdays, despite the advertised hours.  So, if you are looking to order pizza from here, make sure it is before 7PM."}
{"text":"Great Place for Pizza for large groups there is something for everyone and prices are great! Try the Gluten Free Pizza it is Great!"}
{"text":"We go to revolution pizza all the time! The pizza is good and it is like 5 BUCKS! I also love that delicious garlic bread. I eat some on the way home and my family is none the wiser, there is so much of it anyway. The tall guy is always nice. The crust is good. Yeah it's pretty good regular type pizza! But I mostly like the price! Tho sometimes I have to wait. But that's OK! cause I have more time than money. The wings are good too! The stuffed crust or deep dish or whatever wasn't anything special. Regular is better."}
