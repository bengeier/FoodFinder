{"text":"First of all,  this place is much too loud and the seating too proximate for an upscale establishment.   Literally the tables barely have enough room to squeeze between, and since you almost have to yell to converse, you easily hear your neighbors conversations.  

The seafood tower was excellent with the dry ice presentation and quality/taste of shrimp, lobster, crab that we had.

So why two stars?   We ordered an 8oz Kobe medallion filet, and instead were served something resembling a  thin flat iron cut.   The waiter specifically said they had the same steaks as Mastro's Steakhouse, so I figured even though this was Ocean Club, they would be competent in red meat.    They were not.

For a much better experience at this price point, I would suggest Dominick's across the street."}
{"text":"I thought this place was alright.  I had a $100 gift certificate so I decided to take my parent's to this restaurant when they came into town.  Of course, $100 didn't go very far, but that wasn't a surprise.
The staff was very attentive but our waiter was very talkative and kept on trying to do the hard sell on the high ticket items.  UGH!  
I ordered the petit filet which was very tasty.  My dad ordered the scallops and they were absolutely delicious.  My mom ordered the swordfish which was pretty good.  The portions weren't too big, with the swordfish being the largest portion.
When all was said and done, I'd probably give this place 3.5 stars out of 5.  Nice place but I expected a little more for the money."}
{"text":"We've dined at Mastro's before and was hesitant to go back simply because there are soo many great places in Vegas.  With that said we decided to have drinks and apps this time.  We weren't disappointed!!  I ordered a strawberry lemon drop and my girlfriend ordered a raspberry lemon drop...they were delicious. My husband and his friend ordered the penicillin and they were equally delighted! I didn't order the butter cake this time but it's a MUST!  If you choose to go definitely make reservations particularly if in Vegas on a busy weekend. Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"A-maze-ing!! Everything was wonderful - even my slightly undercooked steak (which they very quickly rectified for me). Heard about the great seafood - so tried it for appetizer (husband) also had for dinner but I was looking for a steak. The food was great - service was wonderful and I know have to wait way too long for my next serving of their warm butter cake!  

Thanks for wonderful evening."}
{"text":"This restaurant not only meets my standards as far as food goes, but even in the atypical situation where your steak is under done, the solution here is that the plate is so hot it will continue to cook as it sizzles in front of you. The appetizers are brilliant, the main courses exquisite, and the deserts to die for. I do not think the price should scare you away because it really meets the price to the cent. I recommend Mastro's highly to anyone I can."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is unique, the food is succulent and the service is second to none!
The lobster mashed potatoes are a must! The bone in filet can't be beat! The warm butter cake is the best desert I've ever had! Mastro's is hands down the best restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Based on my food I would have given this place a two stars.  I ordered the sole which which was bone dry.  I could not eat it.   FYI ... Everything is a la carte.

The service was very good.  The \"treehouse\" location of our table was unique.  Drinks and wine were good, although pricey. 

I would not return because they could not cook my entree."}
{"text":"Wow...where do I begin?! We came here as a family just for the great Mastro's experience, and boy were we amazed. To start off, my two older sons shared the Boston clam and chowder, I shared the lobster bisque with my youngest(soup portions are big enough to share), and my husband ordered the escargot. All of it was the bomb .com.


   For the main course we shared the sides of corn in creme, mashed potatoes w/ lobster, and the best mac in cheese this world has ever seen. My oldest son got the bone in fillet, the best dish of the night.. (yes I said dish). I got the scallops as well as my middle one, perfectly cooked,and the sauce was heaven with the bread. My husband got the New York strip, which was cooked perfectly and very delicious!!!! My little one had a little of each of our plates ;).

   The dessert was really good especially their signature butter cake. Service was amazing, and our waiter George was awesome.

  Thank you Mastro's Ocean Club for the dining experience that I will never forget."}
{"text":"I had the lobster bisque it was extremely salty. The steak was cooked as like I have requested. I ordered the steak with the truffle butter, for $15.00, I could have done without it. The service was good and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Was here for a private party and am very grateful to the hosts for treating us all to the experience. In a luxury mall on the strip. Be sure to window shop on ur way to the restaurant. Amazing service. Excellent wines. A filet cooked to med rare perfection & so generous in its proportions i couldn't believe my eyes. Very interesting architectural statement in the main dining room. And at least two sculpture groupings in the mall worth a look."}
{"text":"Went there for special occasion. Great bar and drinks. Ordered Hawaiian tuna. Kitchen overdosed on toasted sesame seeds and tuna didn't appear to be same day fresh and somewhat stringy. Manager was kind enough to make amends. Otherwise everything else was great!!! Billy the bartender and Chris the waiter always super. 
Will go back but will probably not be ordering the tuna again. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. I had the blackened Chilean sea bass and the bruselsprouts, the flavones were incredible."}
{"text":"A snobby Canadian boy took me to the Mastro's Ocean Club. The conversation didn't go that well and he was as full of himself as he could be. Luckily, the delicious food and wine made up for the sour date.

We started with the oysters (Blue Points I think). They were fresh and delicious. We then shared the seared scallops and bone-in fillet mignon as our main dishes. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They were a bit creamy for my taste but overall a solid dish. The bone-in fillet mignon, omg, was soooo good, probably the best steak I've had in the US. The meat was tender yet full of flavor. I was in heaven and couldn't care much less about whatever Mr. Snobby was barking about. 

Oh and we shared crab gnocchi as the side dish (with a price tag of $30, a bit steep for a side dish.) I also had a glass of Pinot Noir (ZD '09) to go with the steak - the wine didn't have enough body, but it went very well with the meat. 

I knocked off one star because they served the scallops and the steak at the same time in the same plate, which I really didn't like. I would prefer having them separately. The scallops should have come first and then the steak as two individual courses. This way I could have really taken my time to taste each dish. 

Overall, I really liked this restaurant. As for my date, I found out he wasn't all that annoying anyways. He was kinda cute and was quite thoughtful when I wasn't feeling well at the end of the meal. I may come back to the Mastro's next time I am in Vegas. Will I go out with Mr. Snobby again? I think so."}
{"text":"Delicious food period. I take all my visitors for a meal here so I can gloat that I have this fantastic place in my town. Lobster and steaks supreme. Just love the food...getting hungry writing this. Go here for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service , tasty food and perfect location . ALTHOGUH it's expensive but believe it worth it . Ihave tried flowery flavor fish as a main dish and it's just great .. also the appetizers are yummy I have got crab mix and tomato cheese salad .. if u r a big fan of pinacolada u haven't drink a heavenly one if u r not in thia place."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant that catches your eye. The staff was really nice and knowledgeable. The food is pricey but it's located inside of Crystals so that's to be expected. The beef carpaccio was delicious, the oysters were fresh and my mom ordered the sea bass which was perfectly cooked and tasty. I told them that it was my mother's birthday and they brought out a cake with a candle for her on the house. Great surprise. Great staff, great food and overall great experience! A must to check out."}
{"text":"Food is awesome.  We split a shrimp cocktail (4) and two Alaskan claws to start and they were served over dry ice, excellent!  Bone in ribeyes with spinach was excellent but maybe too much.  Could have split the steak leaving room for the butter cake dessert.  Also the bread is incredible.   For wine add the Stags petite syrah.  And they were generous with the wine.  Only downside was tables for two are limited and we were a twosome.  The guys big head in the both next to us was the center piece for us.  Good place for 4 to 6.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"Coming to Vegas? You have to try this place, from great mixed drinks, entree's you will not forget, to butter cake for dessert...you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very high priced for what you get. Service was good and attentive. The food was just not worth the high price. Sweet potato fries on menu come out in what tastes like fish batter. They were not labeled as anything but \"sweet potato fries\" but when they delivered them to our table it looked like 2 pounds of battered fries that were not good. Then they called them tempura style. They took them off the bill and were very professional. They even surprised us with an excellent butter cake for a birthday in our party. I would score them higher if it were not for the value for the money."}
{"text":"I really like this place and I'll tell you why, the service is exceptionally well all the servers and hostesses are very well mannered and helpful. The food is out of this world if your ever in a party if 4 or more I recommend getting the seafood tower it's enough to feed 7 or if you want something individual I highly recommend the steak or specialty of the night, the dessert is a perfect way to finish off the night you can order the butter cake which is irresistible and the atmosphere is really good it's not boring it's buzzing all the time"}
{"text":"Great ambience. Great service. Petit filet with lobster mashed potatoes was perfect. They offer half orders of sides which is a great option to try a few different things. The butter cake was awesome -- 3 people can share or 2 dessert lovers. No complaints. Great time."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for date night. We had an amazing time seated in the tree house.  We both loved the atmosphere. 

Everything we ate or drank was overwhelmingly delicious. It would be to great a challenge to identify a favorite dish. Though don't leave until you have tried the signature butter cake.

The service was everything you could hope for. Our waiter Lionel was very attentive yet gave as the space to enjoy our date. We never felt rushed and every one one of his recommendations enhanced our meal. 

I hope this was the first of many visits."}
{"text":"Unbelieveable experience! Went there with a group of 8 and sat in the treehouse. The food was fantastic but it was the service that made the night. Our server knew the menu inside and out and made recommendations that everyone enjoyed. She even knew all the preparations inside and out. Some had seafood while others enjoyed the signature steaks Mastros is known for. Also the cocktails were great. If you have a group and are looking for an A+ experience while in Vegas this is a great choice."}
{"text":"If you want a good tasting steak this is the place.  The seafood tower is spectacular and the oysters and very good and large.  Everything about the place is top-notch and the ambiance for date-night is even better near the piano bar.  If you want a cozy, intimate and very well serviced restaurant this is the gem.  Full service bar and a great place for mini-macro meetings for those clients that want the very best.  Amazing staff and the food is above and beyond.  I am a small business owner, wifey and mommy of 3 and live in N. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I would do a 3 and a half star rating if I could but since I can't, they don't deserve a 4 for sure.

Friends have ranted and raved about maestros since they knew my love for fine dining. Frankly, it was mediocre. 

It is located in the Crystals near the Cosmopolitan and Aria. It's in this art structure that looks like a nest type deal. Then you walk in and we were seated near the \"open\" area of the restuarant. It basically overlooks the mall. Not impressed, but then again it is Vegas.. What else to stare at than people. 

Long story short. Ordered my steak with a near bored to death server or blatently rude..and my girl ordered hers rare and they both came back medium... Was not happy. The drinks were OK and the only thing that sold me was their final dessert of the butter cake. Basically made my whole night. 

Overall nothing to rant and rave about..."}
{"text":"Best restaurant meal ever!! Super expensive but worth every penny. Our family ate here on Christmas and it was just perfect. The food, service and atmosphere are wonderful. Great pacing of the courses and the lobster mashed potatoes are amazing"}
{"text":"Went to Mastro's with friends for a belated birthday celebration. Well worth the wait. Opened with salad and calamari and our waiter, Craig, recommended a nice wine. 

The main event made my night: bone-in filet, cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. I suggest this as a place to visit with friends. You can find more intimate spots for a date, but it's perfect for enjoying an upscale dinner with a group."}
{"text":"I can be a big spender when the time is right and when you're in Vegas, the time is right.  Instead of standing in line at a buffet and stuffing yourself with mediocre food, why not go all out and get an exquisite meal at a first class restaurant?  The quality of the food here is out of this world and so are the prices so be prepared to drop $150 per person or more if you go all out.  The steaks are huge, cooked to perfection and the Seafood is fresh and soooo tasty.  The service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"All of my friends and I would come to Ocean Club to see Marley Taylor perform & to dance the night away to her music.  She performed there for years, has a huge following & is a locals favorite in this town and now-we no longer see her there & the live music has been TERRIBLE lately, it's just not the same...  so we are all not coming back.  Unless you bring Marley Taylor back!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has become one of my all-time favorites! I've eaten here multiple times over the past 3 years, and that's says a great deal because the Strip has so many fine dining options. I've actually had the same waiter, Mike, a couple of times. His knowledge of the menu, and service to our table couldn't have been better. 

My favorite entree is the Fillet of Arctic Char Oreganata style. This is a flavorful fish like sockeye salmon or snapper, not bland or mild like grouper or cod. The portions are large at Mastro's, both the entrees and the sides, and this dish is no exception. They serve 2 fillets of fish. There must be 12 to 14oz of fish on the plate. I've ordered steak here once as well, an 8oz petite filet. Is was excellent, cooked perfectly, as one would expect at a high-end restaurant. 

For desert, I recommend sharing the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake. It has an amazing smooth and warm buttery taste that intensifies as you near the cake's center. 

Lastly, with regard to the dining experience, the restaurant is located in the Crystals Mall, however, there is no \"mall-feel\" to the experience whatsoever. The wooden \"tree house\" dining area is an impressive sight to see, and a truly unique and beautiful open-air room to dine in."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had, bone in filet. Service is great. Setting odd but it works. Prepare to spend.  You have to try the butter cake for dessert. It's a legend."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the Mastro's in Chicago before and we were looking forward to a great steak. The low down for the Mastro's in Vegas is below:

A) Service: Superb. Our waiter was fantastic. Best overall service in a restaurant we've had in a long time.

B)  Atmosphere:  OK. We sat \"outside\" so that we had a view of the mall. The atmosphere here is really not conducive to a great experience. You feel like you are eating in a mall food court. They should really try to find a better location with better ambiance. 

C) Food. Really good ( almost) There were 4 of us and we all ordered some variation of a fillet. Mine came out perfect, but my wife ordered hers medium rare and it came out close to well done. We were having such a good time with our friends that she didn't want to spoil the scene and return the steak. Otherwise everything was great including the shaker that they bring to your table with your cocktail, so that you actually can 2 glasses of booze for $18 rather than one. 

Overall, another great steakhouse in Vegas. Probably won't come back. Not because it was poor, but just because there are so many other places to explore in this restaurant town."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most amazing dinners from start to finish. The food was excellent but what really topped it off was the customer service. I highly recommend having Juan@Tanya as your servers. Those two are top notch. I am very picky on customer service. It seems like a forgotten art these days. They were friendly, never let our glasses empty and even helped with pairing  food. Juan even suggested we remove some items from our order just because it would be too much and we would of been stuffed. So many times these days wait staff don't care what you order or how much. And they expect their 20% regardless. Not these two! We will visit Mastro's again in the future."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh we are still talking about our dinner at Mastros.  What an incredible experience!  Focus on the word experience because that is what it is.  Excellent service with super friendly and knowledgeable staff, great ambiance and outstanding food.  Not too often you get all three in one place.  We went to Mastros on a Wednesday night recently and were seated in the bird cage area.  Very cool way to encase the restaurant in the mall.  Elizabeth and Daniel took care of us that night and what a great team.  So friendly, relaxed, professional and fun they made it such a great dining experience.  Before i even get to appetizers I have to mention the bread basket. I'm not a huge bread person but this was so good! And my martini was classic, simple and perfect. For appetizers we got the spicy salad and the heirloom tomatoes and buratta cheese.  I struggled feeling like I should choose some seafood but Daniel assured me the tomatoes were spectacular right now.  Boy oh boy was he right!  Fantastic flavors on both of these dishes.  For dinner my husband chose the filet rare which few places will actually cook RARE.  His was picture perfect.  I chose the seabass with the Oregenatta topping suggested by Elizabeth - DELICIOUS! Just outstanding.   Lucianna the Bar Manager realizing we were from Washington DC told us about the new restaurant opening there in just 2 days.  She was lovely to check that we were enjoying our time and sent over their signature butter cake for dessert.  we weren't going to get anything since we were stuffed but we dug into what we now call the dessert to beat all desserts.  My husband is a big chocolate person so saying this about vanilla cake with caramelized sugar, vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce is something.  Like all the other diners say - this is not to be skipped!  when you pay a lot of money for dinner you want it to be good and rightly get annoyed when it's not.  We walked away saying this place is worth every single penny.  we haven't had such a lovely time in ages.  I cannot wait to return to Mastros in Las Vegas and will be sure to visit in DC.  Thank you Elizabeth, Daniel and Lucianna!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time with restaurants that offer too much, and this is one of those, give me 5 specials, not 15, and don't give me all of their prices, because I am not going to remember anyway.  The steak was absolutely superb though, and the seafood was good.  The waiter kept spitting on me, maybe he just didn't like my face.  The bar/restaurant is HUGE an happening, so don't come here if you are looking for an intimate atmosphere."}
{"text":"After hitting for a couple hundo at the Blackjack table, the wife and I decided to splurge on dinner in a venue where we knew the decor and ambiance was going to add a good 40% to the tab, if you know what I mean.  Was it worth the extra scratch?  As the Kool-Aid Man famously yells, \"Ohhhh, Yeeaaahhhh!\"

Every course we ordered was mouth-watering delicious, from the Sea Scallops to the Filet and Lobster Tail to the complimentary Chocolate Cake I received for my birthday.  All of our items were cooked to perfection, and the flavors were incredible.

If you get lucky at a table game, or hit a jackpot on a machine, treat yo'self!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Solid American, good steaks, but really, this place shines for dessert. Namely the Butter Cake.

It weighs seemingly 8 lbs. Two people would be hard pressed to finish it, especially if you just ate a huge steak.

Pricey dinner, but large portions and good food.  Great service, fantastic location if you sit in the \"tree house\".  Live music often and usually very crowded."}
{"text":"This is a great seafood place. The Ahi seared tuna is so much better than the ones in most sushi places in the valley. Alcoholic beverages priced rather high with house wine that starts at $12.  Don't forget to order the warm butter cake! it is YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I come here everytime I visit Vegas. I usually share the Porterhouse, which is amazing - Tender and a top quality cut cooked to perfection.

Top it off with the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi and Lobster mashed potatoes, it's definitely worth the visit. 

Yes it is pricey, but it's as good as it gets!

Book ahead and ask to be seated in the Treehouse!"}
{"text":"Actually, this place isn't bad if you're into terrible service and over priced steaks, or should I say, SALT with meat. This location is a horrible disappointment compared to the Mateo's steak house in Chicago. Seriously folks, there are way better steaks at so many other restaurants."}
{"text":"Fancy seafood-steakhouse in Scottdale! 4/5

If you are looking for great ambience and great food, Ocean Club is the place to go! J and I went there last year and we loved the food. It is basically the Mastro's menu from other Mastro locations but added seafood component in it. Great steak too! The price is on the high side, with around ~$35-45 per entree. The bill could easily come around $200 plus drink. Would definitely check back!"}
{"text":"Awesome dining with a great atmosphere.  I make a point to dine here every time I visit Phoenix. Fish is phenomenal  I have yet to be disappointed.  BTW... the vanilla cake our server Steve recommended was off the chart good."}
{"text":"I came here on a business happy hour - turned - dinner and had a fabulous experience. There were about  7 of us to begin with and we took over several high-tops, but as our party grew to about 20, they still were very accommidating and pushed table after table together in a bar which it's space is always in high demand. By the time we were done, 4 hrs later,  people were literally looming over our shoulders for our spot.

We started with a tower of shrimp cocktail, calamari, and crab cakes, and a variety of martinis. All excellent. Then as the drinks kept flowing we decided to dine right there. I shared scallops and a filet with a co-worker and I kid you not - the best scallops i have ever had in my life.  Absolute perfection. The sea bass someone else ordered looked equally good (He said he's been spoiled by the sea bass here and cannot order it from any other restaurant.) 

If you want perfect seafood and drinks for dinner, come here. If you want to see and be seen with the Scottsdale elite, come here. The people watching at this bar is second to none. I think after it was said and done, the bill came to the upper thousands.  So don't come here unless you are prepared to drop some $."}
{"text":"PERFECTION!

Mary brought me to Mastro's for my Birthday dinner as part of my Birthday trip to Las Vegas in August.  Our dinner at Mastro's in Vegas, as all our dinners at every Mastro's we have ever visited was pure perfection.  

The ambiance and the food, the staff, the management.... Impeccable!"}
{"text":"I regret not going back to Jean George's Prime restaurant. 

I wouldn't  go back to Mastro's if you paid me. To be fair it wasn't because the service was bad because it was very good. Props to our waiter Troy.

If you're a steak-snob you're going to weep for the cow who gave his life to the second rate chef who doesn't know how to season a cut of meat. I ordered the 18oz bone-in filet which is a glorious piece of meat. It was the first time in my life I didn't finish a steak.

If you're like most people you'll have ONE, maybe TWO, nights to eat out in Vegas. If you're  considering going to Mastro's, that means you're likely considering other high-end restaurants like Prime, Cut, Craftsteak etc. Regardless where you go, you're going to spend $90-$150 a person so wouldn't you be disappointed if you weren't blown away?!

Go to Prime."}
{"text":"Wow, this place certainly earned every amazing review it received. I did extensive research before I picked a restaurant to take my mom for her 70th birthday dinner while in Vegas for the weekend. I ordered the bone-in filet; she ordered the grilled salmon. The salmon was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked, generous size, literally melted like butter. Speaking of which, we ordered the heirloom tomato/cheese appetizer. OMG, yum, yum, yum! Again, the portion size huge for an appetizer. As for the bone-in filet, well, we both agreed the best steak we've ever tasted. Oh, and the bread basket? Huge, warm, ridiculously fresh variety of insane bread and butter. As for dessert, they brought her their signature warm butter cake with a side of whipped cream... okay, without questions, best dessert I have ever tasted! I literally brought the leftovers home on the plane the next day! As for SERVICE - top notch but not stuffy!!! Our waiter Tim was awesome!!! So funny, professional, accommodating, couldn't have asked for anything better. As for the PRICES - hey, it's Vegas, it's going to be expensive; however, there are thousands of restaurants that are overpriced and you feel ripped off when you are done - not Mastro's! Worth every penny if you ask me (and my mom!). Absolutely excellent dinner all the way around, would treat myself to this upscale dining experience any chance I could get!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Everything I tried was awesome, service was the best. Out of everything I tried the escargot impressed me the most. I would defiantly be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Have dined here over a dozen times.  Love the live piano music in the lounge.  The Chilean Sea Bass and desserts are to die for.  And the service is of course, top notch.  Just be careful in the lounge, I always notice that the floor is extra slippery when in high heels.

One of my favorite places to eat in the valley!"}
{"text":"This is a good steakhouse, but not 5 star which is what I was expecting (and what I paid for). We went for my wife's birthday. The bone in ribeye is really good. Imo, it's as good as Ruth Chris (but not as good as Fleming's). The potatoes were ok (but my wife makes WAY better). The desert there is friggin ridiculous! It's this huge butter cake and it's awesome! So get that and save room for it! Actually, maybe skip the steak and just get that! That's the only thing I would come back here for.
The atmosphere sucks because you're in the middle of a mall. It's not really romantic or? classy - more like food-courty...
Service is good. The waiters were a little bit formal for my taste, but it's kind of that type of place."}
{"text":"The website is wrong. It is http://www.mastrosrestaurants.com/ 

Hands down, by far the most DELICIOUS meal I have ever had in my life. Truly cannot understand how this doesn't have five stars from everyone. If I could rate it 100 stars, I would! 

Before getting to Arizona I heard from everyone I spoke to that we HAD to go to the Ocean Club at least one night. While my expectations were high going in, I was completely blown away by everything. The service was world class. Wish I could remember our waitress's name, she was superb (pretty blond woman originally from Ohio who was working in the downstairs area near the bar). 

We came here on Saturday night with my parents who were in town as well for the weekend. Loved sitting at the high top tables near the bar! There was plenty of room for everything... Wine was delicious, we had two bottles... 

The menu was overwhelming but our waitress really helped us work through it. We had the steamed mussel appetizer and salads, in attempt to save our appetites for the main course. The mussels were delicious and there were plenty for the four of us. 

For dinner my mother and I shared the bone in fillet and the twin lobster tails. They split everything for us before coming to the table and served everything on plates that had been heated to 400 degrees... Our entire meal was fantastic, I am drooling just thinking about how delicious that steak was. My fiance and father both had the 22oz bone in rib eyes and had plenty left over to take home for lunch the next day. We shared some sides, but they were nothing to report home about in comparison. 

Once we were finished and everything had been taken away the wait staff dropped off their signature Warm Butter Cake... Our server got it for us since it was our first time there as a surprise. WOW. WOW. I am a HUGE dessert snob and when I say this was the most incredible thing I have ever tasted... that is an understatement. It was so insanely delicious I cannot even begin to describe it. 

Let me just end with saying that if you are in the area and want the most delicious meal you've ever tasted... go to the Ocean Club. I cannot wait to get back."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite places. However, recently I made a reservation via their website and Open Table one week out from my event and they were unable to accommodate my request for a booth in their lounge area. I would have assumed that a week out reservation would have guaranteed my request.  Guess not.  They called to confirm my reservation the day of, verified that they received my request and then continued to either make my reserved time change to an hour earlier or 90 minutes later.  Wish they would have called me earlier in the week to tell me that they were unable to accommodate my simple request."}
{"text":"It was a very busy night when we visited this location, but found it way to noisy and the servers are not as attentive for the price.

The food was not as good as the location in California. 

I would not visit AZ location again."}
{"text":"Pricey but very good, we had fish, I would go back to try the steaks."}
{"text":"We came here after leaving another restaurant before eating due to poor service and we are SO happy that we made the switch!
My husband and I came on a busy Thanksgiving evening and they squeezed  us in with no problem. From the get go, the service was amazing! Amazing food. It's expensive but worth every dime. 
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"12-23-10

We met a friend for dinner at Tommy Bahamas in Kierland but it was too crowded to get seated so we walked across the street to the Ocean Club.
The place had a very nice feel to it but was also packed.  We found a table and enjoyed their excellent wine list until my husband got hungry and we decided to stay for dinner.

About the food:  We started with a Caesar salad and split a petite filet mignon.  The salad was very good and the steak was moist and tender and well-marinated.  We were very pleased with everything, including the California Pinot Noir.  Not to mention, the ladies room has an attendant, which is a nice touch.

We highly recommend the Ocean Club at Kierland."}
{"text":"Can I just start off by saying, THIS specific Mastro's set the bar for all future fine dining for me.  We were in Vegas for my boyfriend's birthday and knowing that he loves steak, I got us a reservation at Mastros after seeing the high reviews. I left a little note with my reservation on Open Table stating that it'll be my boyfriend's birthday and requested to be seated in the tree house. We got everything we wanted and more!!

First off, we got there about 5-10 minutes early but the hostesses seated us right away. They even greeted him happy birthday and sparked a lovely conversation with us while walking us to our table. She was so friendly and made us feel comfortable knowing that it was our first time dining with them. 

When we were seated, our waitress (whom I wish I remembered her name because she was simply the greatest) got us all settled with drinks and everything. She too greeted my boyfriend happy birthday and went on to tell us her recommendations since we were new to their menu. My boyfriend jumped at hearing the tomahawk steak so we went with that for him. Me, I'm not really a steak person but I really wanted to try their lobster mashed potatoes and their king crab black truffle gnocchi. I couldn't choose between the two so she said they can split half/half for me and make it an entree. Ahh, she made life so much easier! After we placed our orders, my boyfriend realized that he wanted some sides since his plates was just going to be a huge hunk of meat. So we asked her if we can add some sautéed mushrooms and spinach if it wasn't too late. She made it happen! 

While we were waiting for our food, all the passing waiters or hosts all greeted my boyfriend happy birthday. We were so shocked cause damn, they made him feel like a king! Everyone knew it was his birthday and they made him feel super special, which I lovedddd. Our food came out after what seemed like barely 5-10 minutes, so quick! We didn't really hear her when she described how big the tomahawk was.. But when it came out, it was a huge 30-33 ounce steak..LOL . He devoured that thing till he couldn't any longer. Every bite melted in our mouths, it was delicious! They placed all the sides on our plates one by one, making us feel like royalty! Everything was delicious!!! They even brought him out a complimentary birthday cake and offered to take pictures for us. Overall, I was so mind blown by the superb service we had that night. My bf said I won best girlfriend of the year award for this dinner. (;

Expensive? Yes. But it was worth every penny!! I will definitely be coming back every time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I think it is actually called the \"tree house\", but I kept calling it the birds nest. Whatever it was, it was cool!! Now, keep in mind, this was a business dinner that I was at, so anything goes when it comes to ordering!! 

As far as what I had, I started with the chopped salad. Delish! For dinner I got the petite filet special. This was different than the regular petite filet, because it came with the most delicious king crab leg meat as well in a yummy butter sauce. I honestly could only eat half of the steak, this was just too much food all around. 

For sides, we got the mushrooms, creamed corn, creamed spinach, sweet potato fries, and scalloped potatoes. holy bananas these were all so good.

Then we finished with the butter cake!! Which is gigantic, way to big for two people. We all got some of it (there were six of us), but keep in mind we were stuffed at this point! The noise level was reasonable in this restaurant, so it was perfect for a dinner with colleagues."}
{"text":"we did not have a reservation but they were able to get us 2 seats at
the bar.  The barstaff provided great service in addition to making
lots of drinks.  Busy Friday night.
The food was excellent and very large portions, we were able to order
half portions since we were a party of 2.
The meal was a good value given the portions and quality.
Also the restaurant had a very dramatic location."}
{"text":"Heard such great things about this place, but can't begin to describe how disappointed we were.  Came here for an anniversary dinner.  Ambiance was great and the service was top notch.  But the food - yikes.  I got the rib eye medium rare and it was probably the worst restaurant quality steak I've ever had.  My gf got the fish of the day (brazzino) and she described it as pretty terrible as well.  We got the Mac and Cheese and creamed spinach as sides and they were average at best.  

The one redeeming quality of this place was their warm butter cake with whipped cream.  Absolutely to die for! Would come
back and sit at the bar just for this."}
{"text":"as always, food was great, wine was great, creme brulee was great. dont come here wanting to pinch pennies. this place is high end. the prices reflect that but best of all, the food and service reflect that as well! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"On a recent conference visit to Scottsdale, we decided to have dinner here - what a GREAT choice!! The bar was full on a Monday night with live music-upscale vibe and a romantic ambiance. The service from start to finish was 5 star. Our server Eric made our night special with meal and wine recommendations for our group of 6. I'm well traveled and have several fine dining experiences, but this is the first time I ever seen Bone Marrow and Arugula Salad with Pecorino on the menu. I was in absolute heaven!! This is certainly a special occasion restaurant - so my advice is to FIND that special occasion and visit Mastro's Ocean Club."}
{"text":"My wife and I live in Summerlin, and enjoy all the amazing dining that it has to offer. What people who visit Vegas don't know is, our little West Side has eats as good as anything you will find on the World Famous Las Vegas Strip.

However, for special occasions, we still venture down to the zoo.

On this occasion, for our 9th anniversary we settled on Mastro's after hearing nothing but amazing things. Welp. In fact they are all true. We were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food product, and the attention to detail.

Yes. It was an expensive dinner. But man, does this staff and Chef crew nail it. From the soft breads offered, to the Caesar salad, to the lobster mashed potatoes. Yes. Lobster.

The star of the evening beyond the waitstaff who I can't say enough about, was the medium rare Rib-eye with truffle butter cooked to literal perfection. I have eaten many steaks, all over the world. This was simply one of the finest I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.

Well done Mastro's. Well done."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner there with few friends. Food was amazing, service was great. It is pricey. The only \"slight\" negative is that we did no realize that NOT all the tables are inside the tree-house looking structure. We asked to be moved there but they were not very open to it, saying it will be an hour wait or so."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best service of any restaurant in Phoenix. But for a place where you can easily spend $500 or more for a dinner for two it better have great service!

The calamari, caesar salad and steak options are all great. And theres enough space between the tables that its fairly quiet and you can have a conversation with others at your table.

The atmosphere is uptight and pretentious so you better drive your brand new $150,000 car here or you're going to feel poor and out of place."}
{"text":"The lobster mashed potatoes alone merit a 5 star review for this place! I could just eat that for dinner! The staff are courteous and attentive. One of my favorite places for fine seafood in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Mastro's for a romantic Valentine's date. We were very excited to dine here, but our experience was everything but romantic. We had made a reservation and the hostess was very nice but she gave us the worst table in the house. I know restaurants are very busy on Valentine's but the plastic tables they added to the restaurant (the one we sat at) is very tacky for the ambiance \"Mastro's\" gives off. We got put in a corner, right next to the server station, where we heard the servers chitter chatter throughout our whole meal, the wooden doors slamming as they grabbed items for tables was very annoying. It was just not the feel my boyfriend and I wanted for a romantic Valentine's. The food itself was very delicious. Our waiter did try and rush us throughout the whole meal. Only had about 5 minutes to eat my appetizer before our main course came to the table. At the end of the day not a great experience, I prefer Ruth Chris for a classy dinning experience."}
{"text":"We dined at the tree house for an early dinner (5pm), it wasn't packed as it usually is for later hours. our server was really charming and helpful. He recommended us a good bottle of vino and it went perfect with our steaks! We had both the Japanese wagyu and the bone in fillet steak. Creamed spinach and potatoes were a perfect combo to the Japanese wagyu that melts in the mouth! They do give generous servings that what we had were good enough to share. We had sautéed shrimps for appetizer that was really filling.  Get the butternut cake -if you are into something savory than sweet. It's huge, great for sharing as well!"}
{"text":"I'm disappointed, we dine here for a lot of occasion. We ordered a rather
Large bone in ribeye.$54.00 This steak was seared at such a high temp
That it was burnt on the outside and very rare on inside. I  couldn't  tell
You how it was seasoned I could only taste BURNT! We did not eat it.
And did not want another steak. I chose to take it home for our dogs.
When I got it home and looked at it I was pissed. To see it in the light
This steak was so burnt, I would of asked for our money back!
I plan on calling and letting them know. I plan on going back for drinks
And side dishes. We do like this place a lot. But this was the worst experience ever."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give it 3.5 stars. The food varied from excellent to average and while our server was very friendly a salad was forgotten, dishes were not promptly removed, drinks were not refilled promptly, and when alcoholic drinks were completed we were not asked if we would like another. It seems on the night we went the server just did not have the support he needed for this to truly be a fine dining experience nor did the food measure up to a true fine dining experience. We enjoyed the unique design of the restaurant and the atmosphere but will not be putting it on our short list of places to visit."}
{"text":"It's the little things....

1. Providing dark napkins for those with dark clothing and white napkins for those with light clothing so customers can stay oh-so visibly lint-free.

2. The hostess pulling out your chair to seat you because your date clearly forgot that it was his job.

3. The server's extensive knowledge of the menu! She made it sound better than the menu itself. It's always nice when people convincingly show that they know what they're selling. Makes me have more faith in the restaurant.

4. Although it was inside a shopping center, you could easily overlook it due to the dimly lit dining space and romantic ambiance.

5. Calling you within days to make sure you had a great experience.

6. Servers scooping serving size portions onto your plate, so you won't have to, because eating is so damn labor intensive.

7. OH AND THE FOOD:
- Bone-in filet was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. Order it rare or medium rare.
- ORDER THE GNOCCHI. DO IT. Your tastebuds will thank you.

Two bone-in filets, a side of roasted brussel sprouts, and the gnocchi ran about $180 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly exquisite in every detail. The food preparation is always perfection times 10. Ask for George, the epitome of a White Tux - extemely gracious waiter!"}
{"text":"You have to order cocktails here the presentation is so cool, bubbling and smoking all over the place. And they are so full the value is really good! 

For food I ordered the tuna tartar and oysters as appetizers both were presented beautifully. As the main course of course I had to eat lobster because I am not an animal! When it was time for dessert I was too full for anything so I enjoyed a double espresso so I would be ready for a Vegas night! 

I really should mention the ambience. The location is so cool it sort of feels like you are seated in the skeleton of a wine barrel or an old ship. The beautiful polished wood and dim lighting it had a very romantic feeling. Plus it is elevated in the heart of this shopping area so you can watch all the people passing by. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting from Austin for my birthday and wanted to have a special birthday dinner.  I checked reviews in yelp for a good steakhouse and came across this restaurant. I had not heard of it before but when I saw the very high ratings decided to give it a try. All I can say is AMAZING!  The service was excellent!  Make sure you ask for Mike. He was a excellent waiter. He took his time answering all of our questions and his service was prompt and personal. The food was super delicious.  I had the ribeye cooked hard medium. Talk about juicy and full of flavor! I'm a firm believer that a good steak does not need steak sauce and brother let me tell you absolutely no steak sauce needed. Same for my wife, she had a filet (Oscar style). I paired my steak with a grilled lobster tail. OMG, talk about good. For our sides (ala cart) we had the saute asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. Both very flavorful.  We paired our meal with wine. I had a perfect balanced Summerland Pinot (flavor was heavier than some Pinots but not as heavy as a Cab). My wife had a Jaylor Cab (pretty sure I spelled it wrong). She loved it with the crab and steak.  By the way the crab meat was large whole chunks.  Amazing!  For dessert Mike brought me a smaller version of their butter cake. OMG, OMG!!! I'm a huge chocolate fan and very rarely do I eat anything else, but this cake was phenomenal.  You have to try it.  That's all I will say. 

Anyway I hope this helps. You can not go wrong with this restaurant.  Heck, we initially sat behind Shania Twain but moved because other people in her party were a little loud and we wanted a quiet dinner experience.  From what we were told, they always have celebrities visiting. 

Forgot to mention that we stayed at the Aria.  Which is right next to the Crystal Shops, where the restaurant is. Check them out too. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Superb service and food. Better than average wine list. Steaks and seafood were cooked expertly, sides were just right. Seafood tower was put together appropriately for our 6 person group. I gave 4, not 4 1/2 or 5, stars because it was just tood darned dark and noisy. But still an excellent experience. Pricey as expected, but not overpriced."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The low rating is for the service.  Our waiter, Craig, was not friendly and seemed completely irritated that we were seated in his section.  This was the worst dining experience of our trip.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Always excellent.  Steaks and seafood. Wife had the king crab legs and loved them.  Remember to have butter cake."}
{"text":"From the friendliest hosts at the front desk to the Amazing food, service & live music. WOW!!! OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"12 ounce fillet. Bring your appetite little spend well worth it, defiantly get what you pay for. Sorry no photo phone was tripping out. Sweet potato mash is a must, don't think for a minute they are healthy."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse dining experience we've ever had.  Attentive server and perfect food."}
{"text":"Went to the OC. Atmosphere nice, food tasty, prices high compared to what i am used to in similar restaurants."}
{"text":"It was my first time at a Mastro's establishment. However, I have been to other upscale steakhouses (Larsen's, Ruth Chris, Morton's..) 

The restaurant is beautiful, we dined at the tree house and it was a great experience. It's located in the center of shopping center connected to the Aria. 

The service was impeccable, the waited was very attentive. The waiter was constantly checking up and cleaning the area. All the employes around the restaurant are on their toes, checking everything is running smoothly. 

The food did take a whole to be brought  out. My steak was cooked fine, but my friends was left too rare. We had the lobster mash, sautéed spinach, and the green beans. Overall, I wasn't blown away with the food. Maybe my expectations were set really high because I've heard so much hype around the restaurant. 

My favorite food item was the tuna tartar we got as an appetizer, I really recommend it. 

I would say come here for the experience, I wasn't blown away from the food."}
{"text":"I've been to Ocean Club many times and even had my husband's 40th birthday party there this past September.  However, during our last visit I ordered the crusted ahi tuna which I've had many times before and LOVED. This time, though, it didn't taste BAD but definitely didn't taste good. I didn't even eat half of the meal. 

By midnight, I was sick. I called the restaurant the next day to let them know and had an unpleasant conversation with a manager who was fairly unsympathetic and seemed unconcerned. 

However, I got follow up from the General Manager regarding my experience. His excellent customer service is much more reflective of my previous experiences at Ocean Club and of the reputation of the restaurant in general. I look forward to my next meal there."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere a bit crowded but i guess its so good every1 wants in haha good quality food, nice & delicious cocktails"}
{"text":"Not loving this steak house.  Their seafood tower has very small pieces.  The steak is good, but the sides are small, too.  They do serve a large drink, which I love.  I don't appreciate the bartenders whispering about the guests and trying to not make it obvious."}
{"text":"Our waitress was wonderful, lemon drop martini was great and the pretzel bread was super tasty. However, the logistics and response from management was terrible.

 We arrived on a Monday night without reservation and told only available table is in the bar/lounge area. There was no offer to put our name on a list in case a dining table became available. The bar tables are small for 2 people to sit at, let alone the 4 in our party. The 2 appetizers hardly fit on the table surface. When we noticed that another party in the bar area that arrived 20 minutes after us, sat for 5 minutes and then were shown to a table in the dining room that had been available since our arrival 25 minutes prior - time to leave for us!

Food (appetizers) were okay. The vanilla shrimp tasted like something that I could get any state fair - heavily battered and deeped fried. The calamari was good.

Overall the prices were over the top high, the managers handling of the seating situation was one of the worst ever - I would go back for a martini and a bread stick and sit at the bar only!"}
{"text":"Located in the very sleek and posh Kierland Commons , Mastros is an ideal place for a night out to dress up and have plenty of great seafood. 
Our night didnt start exactly as planned since the restaurant took 30 minutes from our reservation time to seat us. However, from the minute we sat down the evening was great. The ambience is very sleek and classy. There was great live music and a lot of great energy in the room. Given the price range, the crowd is mostly older. 
We had the crab cakes and lobster bisque for appetisers. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave helpful advise to share since the helpings are big. We had the John Dory, pacific swordfish, chilean sea bass among five people.. It is advisable to order some sides since the fish doesnt come with any accompaniments. The fish was perfectly cooked per specifications but the presentation could be a little more appetizing than just slabs of fish on a plate.
Since it was a birthday dinner, the restaurant gave a huge complimentary slice of a chocolate cake which was delicious. 
The place is expensive, the food is delicious and the ambience is classy so can certainly be tried for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Ok it's seriously expensive for steaks and veggies covered with butter and salt.     But let's get serious, people go here for the SCENE.     Weekends have many good looking people, though it can be a wait to sit.     It's usually at least half cougars but half 30s age group.     The bartenders and wait staff are very good, which makes you feel better about spending 200 a person for a night of dinner and drinks.   Maybe Jess if you drink less.      Decor is nice, and the live music is usually good.    Scottsdale is short on high style places so these guys are a rarity, but you pay for it."}
{"text":"My fiance, Shanyce and I  went to Mastros during our vacation around Christmas time and had a wonderful experience.  We eat at the Palm Desert  Mastros often and had to try out the Vegas location. Our server, Sam, made our experience even better. 
We had a great time."}
{"text":"I AINT NO UPPER CLASS. I don't go out and spend $100 on dinner everyday. With that said.. I don't appreciate my waiter giving me attitude just because I don't know half of his fancy schmancy expensive food vocabulary.

We got there last Friday at around 730 PM. The waiter went over the menu with us and began taking order. We didn't know what kind of cooking style we want on the fish. When we asked him questions, instead of him answering patiently, he decided to just give us THE LOOK and say \"i just went over all the cooking style with you..\"BLAH..

The food was salty and whatever.. 

I don't understand why he's giving me attitude if I still have to pay him tip.

I'm gonna save that money for a nice purse next time."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.   

A for architecture.

C for food.  

In a city with plethora of premiere steak restaurants, this place does not impress.  If you are used to great steak restaurants in Vegas like Prime, Joe's prime, Capital Grill.....Mastro's is not a place you want to spend your $$$ in."}
{"text":"I came here for my friend's 30th birthday dinner. It was delicious. Seafood was obviously delicious, but what really surprised me was that their sides were also great. This restaurant served me the best gnocchi I have ever eaten. Just for that wonderful surprise, I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!!! Our waiter was the nicest man, the food was delicious I recommend the Alaskan crab legs and the gnocchi. You have to try this place"}
{"text":"I always make sure to stop by when I am in Las Vegas I come here pretty frequently the service is excellent the restaurant is very classy the waiter went out of his way to get the chef to make us a special pasta dish that they do not serve on the menu I will never forget that and am happy that I discovered this restaurant in the crystals mall I usually eat the one in Beverly Hills and this one put to shame try the lobster mashed potatoes and a bone in filet mignon they have a pretty good lemon drop martini as well"}
{"text":"Was highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  Sat at the bar and the service was off the charts. Very friendly, attentive and concerned about how things were without being rude.  Staff made excellent recommendations.  Food was fresh and very flavorful..  Highly recommend the jalapeño tuna shashimi.  Pricey but worth every bit.  Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!! I was there with 2 of my girlfriends for dinner, it was our first time there.  Mario, our waiter, was AMAZING! Even though it was our first time there, he made us feel like regulars. They even bought us dessert! The ambiance was great! The food was beyond amazing! We had ribeye cooked to perfection, and the mushrooms were incredible! Overall of of the best restaurant experiences I have had!"}
{"text":"Simply wonderful ! Best dinning experience ever ! Such attention to details  and needs of customers :) I will be back very soon !!!!"}
{"text":"Mike was one of the best waiters I have had at any restaurant. We will be coming back for our next date night, and asking for him. this was dated feb 14th 2013 - took me this long to post. sorry!"}
{"text":"If you want world class food and wine in Las Vegas, this is the place to go. The food the drinks, the ambiance and the service are unequalled. I will keep coming back to this place every time I'm in Las Vegas, In fact I will come to Las Vegas just for this place alone, IT IS THAT GOOD!!!! 

This place is absolutely the best.  and sorry to say, but maybe better than the other Mastro's locations. :)"}
{"text":"Fail - overpriced, poor service, and mediocre food! Why pay over $120 per person for such service and food? Save your money and go elsewhere.

I ordered the much acclaimed bone-in ribeye, which came in charred and dry. The vegetables were insipid, and the service was terrible. First, I was made to sit in the back corner even though most of the restaurant was empty, and then I sat waiting for the server for well over 15 minutes to order food. Even though there were 3-5 servers standing around looking at me, and I had to ask one of the servers to take my order. All this time, the restaurant was less than 30% occupied.

NOT returning to Mastro's ever!"}
{"text":"I love the Ocean Club !!! Especially the bar. . If you want a Great dinning experience . . you should order from the bar . . .to sit and watch live entertainment while you dine is an aweome experience. . .Your bartenders at OC treat you like a good friend so your comfortable,..If you have a party of 4 or less definately sit at the bar for a WONDERFULL dinning experience. . The bartenders are REAL and fun!!!"}
{"text":"Went there with the girlfriend before Ka. Got the clam chowder to share, she got the maine lobster (mkt price) and I got the round eye steak. We each got a martini. 
Clam chowder was ok, we had better at the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. 
Maine lobster was a bit overpriced but very fresh. 5 waiters came to take out the shell! Girlfriend was amazed
Round eye steak was very  generous. Well cooked, and the outside was pretty crispy despite asking for medium rare. Inside was soft and moist as expected.
Got the cream spinach on the side.
Martinis were very strong and plentiful. Water melon martini was very good. We definitely started to speak more loudly and laughing for no reason after a few full glasses. 
Atmosphere overall feels very open, live music is excellent. Waiters were attentive and professional without feeling overwhelmingly present. Girlfriend had a great time so it deserves the 4 stars. Overall, a great experience though a tad pricey, especially the lobster."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and great atmosphere.  The steak is done right and don't forget to order a lemon drop that comes out smoking and bubbling from dry ice in it and the butter cake is a must"}
{"text":"If you go anywhere, go here. Such a classic steak restaurant with a view that can't be beat during sunset. Be careful with the pomegranate martini, it's delicious but lethal!"}
{"text":"You won't find a better steak in the world.  Awesome atmosphere, always packed, great waiters and waitresses.  Be prepared to spend some big bucks."}
{"text":"Food was most excelente!!! Got the blackened salmon and rack of lamb... Best Bloody Mary ever had ask for Brandon best waiter on section.."}
{"text":"top notch service

great portions at good prices for the quality

actually called afterwards to ask about the service and satisfaction
free buttercake for your birthday!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! The service is top notch and it's the best steakhouse I've eaten at. The bone in ribeye is perfection! I like my steak medium rare, and medium rare is what they gave me. I ate my leftovers the next day, and it tasted just as deeeelicious. The lobster mashed potatoes is my favorite side, and the only one I will get next time. The other sides are pretty tasty, but not worth filling up on when you have a huge steak to consume. BUT you HAVE to make room for the butter cake!! The whip cream is made in house and it's worth every single calorie. 5 stars all around!!!"}
{"text":"This is my first online review.  I felt compelled to write it based on a dining experience that stands apart from others i've had in Vegas.  While there are a handful of high quality restaurants in Las Vegas, Mastros Ocean Club stood out for its consistent, high quality cuisine and  great service.  While the nose bleed prices are over the top and the greet staff unexceptional, the food was excellent, the portions ample, menu deep, ambiance nice and service excellent.  That, in and of itself, is sufficient for me to reserve at least one of my nights in Vegas.  The thing that would bring me there every night was my waitress, Heather.  Sweet, smart, personable, attentive, funny, efficient, knowlegable and unassuming.  She handled tables of conference guys, couples and singles with equal aplomb. I live in NYC, eat out alot, have my goto places with goto staff, and have to say that in a very short period of time Heather distinguished herself as top notch.  If you're lucky enough to get her as your waitress, with sufficent credit line, you'll eat there every night."}
{"text":"This is just for service - Didn't even get to try the food here!

I was excited to try this place during an impromptu Vegas trip. Called for Reservations a week ahead and they called me the day off to confirm. I told them we were running 15 min late and they said it might take longer to seat us.

We ended up waiting 30 minutes before we gave up and left since we had a show to get to. I don't think pushing the reservations 15 back should have made that much of a dramatic wait difference - isn't the point of a reservation is to HOLD the table for me? Whats the diff between holding it 15min in the beginning than if i took an extra 15 min to eat/sit there?  Anyways, as we were waiting at the bar, another couple had  reservation as well and they were waiting longer than we were and also getting fed up.What's weird was there was a decent amount of empty tables so it wasn't like very table was filled to capacity. 

Don't think I'll attempt to eat at this place, whats the point of reservations if you have to wait?"}
{"text":"Some of the best food that you'll ever eat in a treehouse! The seafood and steaks are out of this world. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Overall place is overrated and average. We were a group of 20 people and the overall opinion was average. Service was slow."}
{"text":"The last few times we have been were mediocre at best.  Last nights visit was exceptional!  Probably the best meal we have had, ever.  Every single course was perfection.  Our waiter, Mike, was spectacular.  One of the best.  He was able to accommodate every need we had and ones we didn't know we had.  If I had to guess, there is new management or new cooks in there and everything was perfect!"}
{"text":"I realize I am an outlier with my review. The staff was very friendly and we were escorted to our table at our exact reservation time. However, the lobster in the bisque was tough and chewy. The scalloped potatoes had an imitation cheese taste. My filet was terribly salty and undercooked. I ordered medium well and it was absolutely medium rare. Near purple center. I have never complained in a restaurant and would have if our waitress had ever come back. She stopped by when food was served and I was about to cut into my steak and never returned. After a long wait I finally had the bus boy clear it and asked him to find our waitress with the check. Total bill was $250 with a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding, the good is phenomenal!  We ordered steak which was melting in our mouth, the scallops were perfectly cooked, fresh tasting and leaving us wanting to order a second serving."}
{"text":"Two friends and I were visiting Scottsdale from Las Vegas over the weekend.  We decided to try Mastro's Ocean Club and since it was last minute we decided to just have dinner in the bar area.  All the tables were taken with the exception of about 5 tables the were near the walls.  So I walk to the hostess and ask if the bar area was self seating and I was told to talk to a gentleman regarding the tables near the walls.  I asked him if we could sit at one of the tables and order dinner.  Simple request, right?.  He said he would come find us in the bar and seat us.  After about 30 mins he still had not come to seat us...tables still open too.  I see the guy who was going to seat us and I hold up my hands signalling, \"what's going on,\" he shrugged his shoulders as if to say \"oh well\".  I wanted to leave right then and there but my friends said they were okay to eat at the bar.  Needless to say were not seated and had to settle for a couple appetizers which we ate standing at the bar while 5 tables remained empty.  It seemed like the guy refused to seat us because we did not grease his palm.  It was a terrible experience and I will never visit that particular Mastro's again.  I've had pleasant experiences at the Ocean Club in Newport Beach as well as the one in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing.. The food was on point and we couldn't have asked for better service. Try your absolute hardest to save room for the butter cake I could only fit one bite but it was so worth it. Try this place, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you like lots of Food on your plate you'll like mastro's, if you like a sensible way of serving food you won't enjoy it that much. The filet was superb, as well as the chicken but the sides where for a group of four each and not presented in a way you would expect in a restaurant like that...though they tasted good. Waitress was very attentive..."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and crowd was great.
But we must have gotten very unlucky with the server that night.  
His service was worse than a Denny's, especially when you pay at least $100 a person.   Everyone at the table was very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Mastros never disappoints with fabulous food and service. Must haves: martinis, lobster mash potatoes, and the fried shrimp.
We were very impressed with the staff and general manager Luciana. Thanks for the memories!

{"text":"My girlfriend and I took a whole week vacation off to visit the West coast. It was our first time trip to visit Las Vegas, and the entire experience was amazing and unforgettable. Amid the many alluring performing shows, the endless eyes-dazing slot machines, and the gigantic resorts were some of the most fantastic restaurants that Vegas could offer. 

We first passed by OC while exploring the riches on the famed Strip. It was located within the beautiful Crystal. Upon seeing it, both of us were intrigued by the outstanding artistry presented by the original designer. The structure's frames were made out of steel and covered with fine, deep red wood. Between the frames were giant crystal clear glasses that allowed a perfect view from both within and out. However, the most salient and attracting feature was that the entire structure was slanted. My words would be lacking and limited for the description, but just imagine an hourglass tilted like a forward-slash sign. Bemused by its charm, we booked a table on a Monday night and dressed in proper attires, girlfriend in a beautiful orange-red dress.

We arrived around 10pm after seeing the fantastic Le Reve at Wynn. Being Monday night, the restaurant had only a few tables occupied. We were given a table near the crystal glasses, which allowed an excellent view for the outside. Our waitress of the night was very friendly and polite. As she went slowly on explaining the menu she also told us that the structure was called \"The Tree\", its name inspired by the tiny leaves spurting out of the joints of the steel frames. From the menu, we picked \"Dungeness Crab Cocktail\" and \"Vanilla Batter Shrimp\" for appetizers, a \"Fillet of Arctic Char Oreganate\" with \"Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi\" as entree and side dish. The crab cocktail came in a special tall glass container filled with mist giving dry ice. Each large lumps of crab meat was tender and fresh with the saltiness and sweetness of the ocean. The vanilla fried shrimps were gigantic in size, each crispy on the outside and tender within, a must try for shrimp lovers. The arctic char was perfect, cooked to medium-rare the way I loved. It was a huge fillet more than enough for the two of us to share. The Oreganate style was foreign to me, but the combination of butter, spices, and bread crumbs had made a wonderful sauce suited well with the fish. The gnocchi was huge in portion, baked in large hot skillet and filled with delicious cheese and crab meat. The mix of crab meat, cheese, and truffle gave the dish an unique and saliva dripping aroma. However, due to the large portion, over-stuffing this huge amount of cheese, crab meat and gnocchi is not recommended. You would need to trust me on this, as the first 5 bites would have you mouthwatering for more, but double that you would start having the too-much-cream-stuck-in-your-stomach feeling, and beyond that would be just too much to handle.  Alas, at the end, gf and I had to pick out the delicious crab meat along with the truffle to eat and wasted a large amount of the gnocchi.

Regrettably, since we were on a tight schedule for a night club to visit, we skipped the desserts - What a shame! Dinning at Ocean Club was such a wonderful experience. My gf and I enjoyed every minute from beginning to end. Yes, it was a very expensive place, but so was everything else in Vegas and every penny spend was well worth it. So by chance if you ever stop by Vegas, be sure to checkout this amazing restaurant."}
{"text":"It has taken me a while to find the time to finally add a couple of posts. I decided to treat my girlfriend to a good dinner for her birthday and I remembered how she was saying that she wanted to try Mastro's Ocean Club. I took her there on February 19th as a surprise dinner. For the amount I paid, the service could have definitely been better. Started off great. Had a 9:00 reservation and was seated as soon as we arrived an hour early. Unfortunately the wait for drinks and food took a lot longer to come. The server was very pleasant, but whether she had too many tables, it just took way too long. The food was good. We absolutely loved the Lobster mashed potatoes, the steak was great, and the Swordfish ( usually one of my favorites ) was a decent entrée. The dessert was pretty good too. It was the butter cake which they are known for. I may go back in the future, but there are many other places in town I think I would try first if I plan on spending over $250 on dinner again."}
{"text":"both stars are for its bar. fish is not even mediocre -- it's terrible. appeared steamed with some Lawry's all-seasoning on top. overcooked at that. sides are even worse. didn't try the steak. wine list is very pedestrian. but the bar rocks and people watching in the bar is great. just don't order the food unless you are VERY hungry."}
{"text":"Great food.  The first time I've had bone in sirloin that's not a porterhouse.  Waiter was helpful in explaining menu items.  Downside, they forgot to give us bread so had to ask 2x.  Side servings are huge as are the pours of wine."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club at Scottsdale is just fabulous.  Can't ask for anything else...  Starting from server, food and atmosphere.  This was 2nd time coming in from out of town... Will come back again definitely..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at mastros. 
Their cocktails are delicioussss. I had the cosmopolitan, which featured a dry ice presentation. Beautiful. It was pricey but you get the mixer and the extra contents, which is pretty much 2 cocktails for the price of one.
The food was nothing short of spectacular. I ordered the ribeye and it was cooked perfectly, seasoned well and simply amazing.
Their sea bass is so tender and melts in your mouth like butter! Ah! Yum!
** The really nice thing about the place is their hefty portions, so at least you leave full and like you got your monies worth. 
It a MUST to try the Warm Butter Cake Dessert! It's worth the $16 to spend, it's a warm yellow buttery cake that's crispy on the outside, with sugar coating and warm and gooey on the inside. There's a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and the whole thing is finished with raspberry drizzle. It also comes with a large side of house whipped cream! 

The first time I dined at the restaurant, I received stellar service; this second time around I saw my server 3 times during our meal and I wasn't impressed with his serving qualities. 

All in all, it is definitely an experience to dine at mastros. The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"When we've got money to spend, The Ocean Club is the place we go. Recently we've taken to eating at the bar. This allows us the opportunity to share dishes, something that I wouldn't do if we ate in the main dining room. The first bit of yummy deliciousness is the bread basket. I seriously have to restrain myself from filing up on just that alone. Then we usually go with the lobster mashed potatoes (pure indulgence), either fish or steak, both of which are spectacular, and some type of vegetable just to pretend we're eating healthy. And if I managed to restrain myself with the bread, I might have enough room for the scrumptious butter cake. Usually I just eat a bite or so, but those are some of the best bites I have all night. The service is almost always outstanding, even at the bar. This restaurant is expensive, but always delivers. We go quite a bit and will continue to do so. Another favorite."}
{"text":"I'm a local, so finding the right place to entertain family, friends and clients is important to me. There are a lot of good foodie options in Las Vegas, and this is one of them. 

Our service was exceptional, from the head waiter (Johnny) to the team that assisted. We had clients invited tonight, so it was important that everyone was left fulfilled. Mission accomplished!

We started with the seafood tower. It was a marvelous piece of art loaded with crab, oysters, lobster and shrimp. I had the crusted sea bass. Nice thick cut and very tender. Others had scallops, ribeye and grouper. Everyone was pleased. Sides were good. Very creamy mashed potatoes, followed by tasty macaroni and cheese, sautéed spinach and asparagus. Everyone at our table was pleased. 

My only regret was we didn't have time to try the butter cake for dessert. We had to attend the Bruno Mars concert. (Apparently Bruno Mars ate hear a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it). 

Nice ambiance. Great service. Wonderful food. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Very spendy, but delicious. 

Expect as a 2-top to walk out of there with no less than $150 for the night. Depending on your fancy!

Apps: The seafood tower to me was a tad over rated, if I ordered again, I would get the shrimp cocktail since that was the best part. 

Main Course: I had the bone-in filet, omg melt in your mouth. And it was ginormous. It was one of the best steaks I've had in my life. P.S. The fish is great too, my friend got the sea bass. Yum! 

Sides: You have, I repeat, HAVE to get the:
Lobster Mashed Potatoes
Butter cake - the most heavenly thing that I've ever tasted in my life.

Both are so sinfully (contradicting myself, I know) delicious. Omg ... for my hubbies birthday we went for just those two things! And walked out STUFFED.

The service is out of this world. You can tell these are CAREER waiters. It's not just a job... most of these guys have been in the industry for years. Excellent care."}
{"text":"4 stars: Yay! I'm a fan.

When I called to make reservations a few weeks in advance, I had asked to be seated inside the \"tree house\" and they were able to accomodate this request. 

Mastro's is a steakhouse chain that is better than most. If your school of thought is that Ruth's Chris is the pinnacle of chain steak in America, then you will be pleasantly surprised to have broadened your horizons.  

What I like about Mastro's is that the dining experience is very consistent regardless of the location you choose to frequent.

This particular Mastro's is inside a shopping mall. A very nice shopping mall, but still a shopping mall. It's slightly off-putting, but does not affect the food or the service. If you wish to eat at a \"proper\" steakhouse, with burnished leather, dark wood furnishings, and Laguioles then perhaps Mastro's is not the spot for you.

If you're not too snobbish about your surroundings, I think this is a solid steakhouse in Vegas that doesn't require you to traipse through a casino to get to it.

The food is consistent with any other Mastro's so I won't dwell too much on it. 

Stick with what you know. 

The lobster mash, the crab and truffle gnocchi, biggest ribeye you can split with someone, or porterhouse if they insist on a tenderloin or filet.  

The butter cake is worth every last calorie, so please be sure to save room for it at the conclusion of your meal."}
{"text":"1st rate! Huge portions. Everythng can be split if you agree to eat same thing. Great way to save $$ but they might toss you out for not spending enough. Maybe sit at bar and order and split it all? 
When I called for reservation they asked if it was for a special occassion and I said it was our anniversary...but there was no aknowledgement from waiter, hostess etc.....since we're not regulars we were sat in the \"rookie section\" which is the main traffic aisle by the door.  That's a pet peave of mine when they sit rookies or someone they don't kow in the crap location.  
Anyway.......service was 1st rate. Quality of food 1st rate.  Is it worth the high prices?  To each his own on that......would I consider it a good value? Nope.  This place is a splurge.....when you feel rich and want to burn $$, really starving, so big portions are OK...then book it!
PS:  This is no more of a splure than Morton's, Ruth's etc.......same type of place."}
{"text":"I sent an email thru the Mastro website to let them know I got food poisoning at one of their restaurants. No response from them yet. I guess the restaurant doesn't care about their customers..."}
{"text":"Seafood Version of the great mastro's chain.  Food, Atmosphere, and service are all great, Very nice bar, Try the shrimp appetizer"}
{"text":"After trying many of the best steals in Vegas, I have found the very best!  Service was excellent.  Steak was awesome and the desert was also great.  Generous drinks pours also helped.  Easiest 5 start review ever!"}
{"text":"What drew me here was the treehouse! I've never dined in one in the middle of a mall so we figured why not? I like to people watch too. We went here a couple months ago so my complete recollection is foggy. The features that stick out are the ambiance really. The food was good but nothing that made me say wow, i need to come back and eat this again. I had the miso cod and escargot.  Both good but not memorable. What was memorable was the ambiance. It was romantic yet there were large groups around that worked well too. There was a piano man right next to the bar area that took requests all night. We even stayed and hung out bar side because he was so good! When dining make sure to request to sit IN the treehouse, if not there's not too much of a wow factor in your experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a shout out to the management and staff at the Ocean Club in Scottsdale.  On New Years Eve, we were on our way for our reservation there when we had a flat tire about a mile from the restaurant.  We were already running late, but we called The Ocean Club to tell them what happened, and they said no problem they would hold the reservation.  We ended up calling a taxi, had a delicious meal, and then returned to our car and called AAA.  We were about 35 minutes late for reservation but Ocean Club held it all that time, even tho it was probably the busiest night of the year.  They took the stress out of a very stressful event.  Thank you Ocean Club"}
{"text":"This was the most over rated restaurant I have ever dined at.  The food was just OK. Actually the pretzel rolls were the best part of the meal.  My husband's lemon sole was over cooked and his clam chowder was just ok.  I had the tomatoes and buratta cheese.  The cheese was very good.  My lobster tails:  one baked and one in a vanilla batter were both over cooked.  We shared the Butter Cake which was good but not spectacular.  Along with this our service was horrible.  We had to ask for bread which eventually came had no butter with it.  We had a different person for each course and were totally ignored in between.  In the meantime a woman manager in a business suit and the waiter were busy fawning over the people at the next table.  Eat at Sinatra's if you want a first class meal and exceptional service.
Renee P."}
{"text":"Great place to get some great food! Love the ambiance and atmosphere that this place offers. Can get a little pricey if you go nuts like we do but its nice to indulge every now and than. Nightlife is very good too as the live music and bar crowd are top notch. This place is a must visit!"}
{"text":"Had a bday dinner at Mastro's two weeks ago, and it was a great experience! Prices are very much similar to City Hall, not cheap!

I was surprised that they had one of my favorite oysters - Kumamoto (from Japan). The Kumamoto oysters are small (smaller than blue point), mild flavor, very smooth with a bit of sweetness! Yum!

For entrees, I had the Lemon Sole (a bit of creamy but flavorful, very soft) with a side of Scallops (over on a creamy tomato and basil sauce, so good!!) And mom had the Petite Fillet (very tender and juicy even it's cooked in well-done)..

I love their bread basket! They were maybe 5? different kinds of bread, and my fav is the pretzel bread!

Service was excellent! It was a busy Wednesday night, but was able to get a reservation two hours before our arrival...There were many 'business-expense' tables; the decor is upscale, but i thought they were kinda tight...

It's definitely a great place for some fresh raw oysters and other seafood! Hmm, may just wanna come back for those delicious oysters!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have brought multiple friends just for the buttercake. But today, the host was extremely rude and unprofessional. She wouldn't look up from her book to answer our basic question of if they are serving the buttercake that I will never return or suggest this place to anyone. Check your front desk host and make sure you don't ruin a loyal customers experience to the point of never wanting to return. Clearly management needs to teach customer service."}
{"text":"The butter cake.... why oh why did I let myself be tempted by the butter cake. I SWORE I was full, and refused to look at a dessert menu... but it just appeared at our table... 0_0 BUT IT WAS SO DELICIOUS!

So...

We thought it would be very nice to get some friends and their family together for our college graduation (and a birthday). 11 of us including 3 former students and one current student were seated at a long rectangular table right by the windows. It was a beautiful night out, and these window panes were open allowing us to feel like we were eating on a beautiful patio. 

The service was excellent! The entire wait staff was very attentive, and were always ready to come over and fill our water or to make our dining experience even more enjoyable.

The atmosphere was also excellent. Ocean Club is less stuffy than Mortons but more lively than The Palm. The restaurant has a nice vibe to it which is complimented by life music.

To start I ordered the oysters on the half shell. This is presented with 6 fresh oysters on a mountain of crushed ice. These are served with fresh horseradish and cocktail sauce. These were very fresh, I just wish they gave you more! 

For dinner I ordered the 22 oz bone-in ribeye (medium). This was perfectly cooked and delicious. I like to think of myself as a mini steak connoisseur (one likes to dream :) ) and this steak was certainly one of the best I had. Other people in our party ordered the filet, which I also tried and thought was great too.

The sides are easily shared. For the table we ordered sauteed mushrooms, spinach, scalloped potatoes, and I believe some others.

After drinks, this huge meal, and all the sides... I was beyond stuffed.

Out of no where appeared 4 butter cakes with congratulations written on them in chocolate, and a candle for our birthday boy. As I put my spoon in to some vanilla ice cream and some cake and brought it to my mouth, my stomach seemed to get compacted and some space appeared. Before I knew it, 1/4 the cake was gone and I was satisfied. 

In summary, Ocean Club has a great atmosphere, amazing food, and outstanding service. For a special occasion, a weekend, or for anytime, Ocean Club is where it's at!"}
{"text":"THE best food I've ever had. Filet, white fish special, lobster mash, truffle gnocchi... Service was on point. Very classy. We planned a proposal in the treehouse and it was perfect"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Mastros Ocean Club for a very long time.  We were on a short vacation from Los Angeles.  I have to say that I was disappointed with food and felt it wasn't worth the money.   We were a party of 4.  Started off with the tuna tartar tower and escargot.  I thought they lacked flavor.  I've had better at other places that are not that expensive.  My daughter had the gnocchi with Alaskan Crab as a entree.  She enjoyed it.  My son and BF had the Petite filets 6 oz and 8 oz.  They were tasty but again nothing special.  I had the twin lobster tails.  They came out cold and were flat and just ok.  The sides we had were basic Garlic mash and asparagus.  I informed the waiter about my lobster and he gave us the butter cake on the house.  I thought that was nice.  But then again heard that it was amazing and I didn't think so and happy we didn't have to pay for that.  Our server was nice enough but nothing special.  Guess my expectations were to high."}
{"text":"It's certainly spendy, and there seems to be some debate here among the reviews on if the food is worth it, but the service and location certainly are.

We ate here around Christmas.  As mentioned, the service was phenomenal.  On the advice of my waiter, I ordered a bone-in ribeye, my date ordered the chilean sea bass.  As a side we had the lobstered mash potatoes.

My server Robert was outstanding.  It's the first time I've had a waiter observe my steak after I started eating, confirm that it wasn't cooked as ordered, and offer to send it back for another, without me saying a thing.

2 days later I received a phone call from the restaurant thanking us for the visit.  That just doesn't happen anymore."}
{"text":"I took my Hubby here for his 25th Birthday last night & we were both blown away by Ocean Club. Hands down, one of the best meals we've ever had, period. 

We made reservations for 5:30pm because Entourage was premiering at 7:30pm & we couldn't miss it. It was nice having the place pretty much to ourselves, there were only about 3 or 4 other parties around us. I liked the dim lighting & the chairs were comfy. Our server Eric was very friendly & answered any questions we had regarding the menu/food. 

The bread basket was promptly brought out with our glasses of water. Most of the breads were hard as rocks but were pretty good. The best bread (& softest) was the pretzel bread, I wish we got a basket of only that, it was so good! We aren't fancy drinkers so we didn't order martinis (although I kinda wish I did). Hubs ordered a couple Captain & cokes & I ordered a Vodka (Grey Goose) cranberry. You definitely get your alcohol's worth here, more than 3/4 of the drinks were pure alcohol. For an appetizer we ordered the Vanilla battered shrimp. It was only 3 pieces, but they were HUGE. The outside coating reminded me of funnel cake you get at the fair. Sounds gross with shrimp but it was so delicious, & the dipping sauce it came with was so tasty! For our entrees, my Hubs ordered the Alaskan King crab legs & I ordered the Ivory salmon. For our sides we ordered the sauteed asparagus & Mastro's mashed potatoes. The crab legs were so fresh & they even cracked them for him. The meat was so sweet & tender, my Hubby polished off the whole pound! The salmon was just as good, so fresh & cooked perfectly. This was my 1st experience with white salmon & I must say I might like it even more than pink. The sides were delicious as well, the asparagus were cooked & seasoned perfectly & the mashed potatoes were just right with all the bacon goodness! We were both stuffed beyond belief but being the dessert junkie I am I had to order the Butter cake that everyone raves about. WOW, so sinfully good! It was so moist with the perfect little crunch on top. 

Like others have stated, it is pretty pricey. Our total came to about $180 (I think they threw in the Butter cake for free since it was Hub's Bday-nice!) but it was more than worth it! We will definitely come back for a special occasion & most likely my Hubby's 26th Birthday!!"}
{"text":"nice. good food, good location, testy, friendly...
but In my opinion.. Hollywood one is better then here."}
{"text":"As a preface to this review, I got food poisoning the only time I ate here--and I haven't garnered the courage to eat here again.  Yes, I know I should get back on the horse, but the painful memories of the Tet offensive being played out in my stomach are too fresh in my mind.  So, you can disregard my review or let it light your way as you navigate the various restaurants in the valley.  I have an affinity for those who will do the latter--but I'm very self involved.  Now, onto the review.

I highly anticipated my meal at the Ocean Club.  I was fairly new to the valley and numerous people championed the dining experience for its great food, great ambiance and interesting clientele (*cough* cougars *cough**cough*).  Plus, I am a huge fan of seafood.

Upon arrival, I was impressed by the interior and I was surprised that it was so crowded on a weekday night.  However, the best part was the clientele which made for some fantastic people watching.  

My buddy and I settled in at a table in the bar area and were greeted by a very friendly and attentive waitress (the service at the Ocean Club is top notch).  Immediately to my left was a table with a manther (male cougar) and two attractive young women.  Needless to say, I was elated with our seating arrangement because I knew something interesting was going to happen that night.

As I perused the menu, I kept one eye on the awkward May/December flirtations to my left.  Remember, I was still a newbie in this town and was not accustomed to this type of mating ritual.  Anyway, I ended up ordering a salad and the sea bass entree.  My salad was tasty and I was completely satisfied with my choice.  However, my contentment was tested when the manther's appetizer arrived.  

The seafood tower, the Hummer of the appetizer kingdom, was placed at the table next to mine devoid of any pomp and circumstance.  Such regalia was not needed because the sheer size of this thing is a spectacle in and of itself.  I'm not going to lie, a sense of inadequacy started to envelop me as I gazed at this mountain of seafood goodness.  Luckily, that feeling was short-lived because I convinced myself that, much like the Hummer, the seafood tower was merely a cover-up for certain personal deficiencies.  At this point, I realized that my cynicism is really getting out of control and I probably needed to go to group.  

Soon after I finished my salad, my entree arrived.  The presentation was very good and I was ready to taste the best seafood in the valley.  As I took my first bite, I noticed that the consistency of the sea bass was near perfect, however, it didn't really taste right.  It didn't taste bad, just not what I was expecting.  To my detriment, I chalked this up to fish being flown in and a myriad of other reasons why it didn't taste like the sea bass dishes I've had in the past.  

At the end of my meal, I had high marks for the Ocean Club.  The food, the service and the people watching were great.  However, these positive reactions were soon discarded after I felt the first rumblings from my stomach later that evening.  The rest of the night was spent sleeping on the floor of my bathroom and questioning every choice I had made in life.  Ok, the last part is an exaggeration but you get the idea.

One of these days, I will suck it up and give the Ocean Club one more try because this was more than likely an isolated incident.  Of course, I may wait until I reach manther status so I can order the seafood tower and not feel like a hypocrite."}
{"text":"Read this if you will be having an important occasion at this restaurant:

1.  Mastro's OC is a high-end, busy/bustling place with good food.  That said, they DO have off nights and, in my case, create disasters for diners.

2.  We had a party of 6, with a tab that came to over $550.  Yet, the meat was improperly cooked, some of orders were forgotten (then promised to come \"soon\" and then ultimately never came), our server (whoever it was) never came back to check on us, and when the bill arrived, it contained charges for some else's table and items weren't supposed to be charged for (because we were told the butter cake was on the house because of the server's earlier mistakes).

3.  In the end, we were never served the missing food and needed to stop at another restaurant for one of our diners to get more food on the way home.

4.  The manager, Phil, was empathetic but ultimately ineffectual in addressing what happened to us at Mastro's OC.

5.  Lesson that I learned from Mastro's manager:  if the food isn't prepared the way you want it, just send it back -- don't worry (or feel bad) about the food being thrown away as a result -- since that happens at Mastro's OC all the time.  Well... okay... I'll try to get over my aversion to wasting food next time (if there is a next time).

6.  Just be careful, folks.  The food tasted good, but the server and service were sub-sub-par.  If your dinner is important, maybe it's worth introducing yourself to Mastro's manager on duty before the meal starts.

Good luck!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with Mastro's in B.H. about six years ago. So, naturally when asked to make dinner reservations for an important business dinner, I didn't hesitate. 

Everything was wonderful. The ambiance was beautifully unique. The food was as amazing, as i'd always known it to be. 

We had a nice mix of Filet,  Seafood tower, Rib eye, and a delicious butter cake for dessert. 

They also have one of my favorite pinot noirs on their menu. Summerland. And it's not too pricey! 

Love, Love, Love MASTRO'S. And, when it comes to customer service both this one and Bev Hills location have that down pat."}
{"text":"Had an absolutely fantastic dinner at Mastro's the other day. Our server, Shauna, was more than helpful in helping us navigate the great menu. We started off with the seared Ahi Tuna, which was super fresh and delicious, followed by a great caesar salad. For the main course I had a fantastic filet cooked to perfection. But the best was the sides. Our table shared the Gorgonzola mac & cheese, sweet potato fries, and sauteed broccoli. They were all fantastic, but the mac & cheese was TO DIE FOR.

Shauna said the warm butter cake was not to be missed and she wasn't kidding. I'm surprised my arteries survived that cake after everything we'd already eaten, but it was worth risking it. :)"}
{"text":"Last visit to Ocean Club. Overbooked, VERY loud so had to scream at my other 5 table mates. Food mediocre at best..couldn't eat the veggies. The asparagus very old and not al dente...just HARD. 3rd time here and the last. If you want to pay $150 to $300 for two,  go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great steaks, try the mambo salad and the ahi tostada, great change of pace.
If you want a better experience than the big bar, front and center, for all to pay attention to you, then go to the smaller bar at the back and sit down and be catered to by the best bartender there - Kelly. Great energy, good suggestions, you won't be disapointed and you'll be able to hear yourself think.  Enjoy, it's worth the time and $'s."}
{"text":"Food and service always great. The Manager Daniel is always friendly and goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"My wife and I can be fussy with restaurants, but Mastro's was so perfect on a recent Vegas visit, that we cancelled plans at another restaurant the following night and did Mastro's all over again...with equally perfect results.
Steaks were delicious, tender, and done to perfection. The sides are overly generous and delicious (recommend the Sweet Potato fries). Salads very fresh and tasty. But don't leave without having the butter cake dessert. That was the happiest my tastebuds have been in a long, long time.
Our waiter Mario was sensational. Bright, friendly, and efficient.
And the setting is as fun and charming as others here describe it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Although it's basically a restaurant located in the middle of a shopping mall (albeit an upscale mall), it is a very pleasurable dining experience. The food here is incredible. The lemon drops are fantastic and entertaining as they are served smoking and bubbling. Excellent wines on the wine list. The filet here is magnificent. The truffle lobster gnocchi is out of this world. The side dishes are excellent and feed about four or five people. The warm butter cake is spectacular and is served with a huge bowl of some of the best whipped cream we have tasted. Unfortunately, one of the people in our party ordered the crab cakes and was disappointed with them as she thought they were over seasoned and almost tasted as though they were seasoned with poultry seasoning. The last time we ate at Mastro's Ocean the service was tad bit better, but compared to the poor service that we've been receiving lately, the service was outstanding. Did I mention the live pianist? Some of the people in our party thought they were listening to some recorded Billy Joel music and were surprised when they found out that it was actually a young man playing the piano."}
{"text":"We went here for a celebratory dinner.  I envisioned high end service with a smile.  It's all an appearance.  The waiter was nice but frowned the entire evening.  We were there for late reservations so they weren't even busy.  The food was unimpressive.  Over price and over rated.  I won't waste my money again!"}
{"text":"Very cool place... great food!  Beautiful restaurant.  Great bar area.  we had very good meals....just a tip... split everything.  If you buy for yourself,  you'll never finish.   The soup is for two and the sides are for......   a small family. The entrees are Enormous.   The Drinks are the stiffest ever 3/4th's booze 1/4th mixer.  seriously they bring the glass to the table to show you that there's pretty much nothing but alcohol in your glass then throw in a splash of whatever you want.  And the glasses aren't those rinking dink rock glasses!  they are the kind of rock glass you could barely palm.  Gorgeous people everywhere.  What an awesome ambiance!!!!!!   top notch!  loved it!  It's the kind of place that can make you happy.  go with friends and party!  wait staff was the best!!"}
{"text":"Top 5 in the city.. This place has it covered from great selections on the menu to great food to great service. The staff is on point. Definitely get the seafood tower and the king crab gnocchi."}
{"text":"We recently dined here for my husband's birthday. Having been at the Mastro's in Scottsdale, we knew what to expect: tasty appetizers, good drinks, and even better steak, so we were excited to check out this location.

The restaurant itself is in a unique setting: inside the high-end Crystal mall in the ARIA in a wooden tree house sculpture - pretty unique! I will say that having dinner while being able to look out at the Fendi & Louis Vuitton store did seem to downplay the high-end feel of this restaurant and it made me really annoyed (I know, hater) at all the women walking around with their Chanel & Prada shopping bags.

We were promptly seated outside of the tree house in the booths and as usual, service was second to none. They were aware of the gluten-free dining note on our Open Table reservation and brought me the Gluten Free Menu which is pretty large and almost mirrors the regular menu with a few exceptions and some alterations.

Large signature cocktail, beer and wine menu - I liked that they denoted which cocktails were gluten free as this is usually a place in the gluten-free menus restaurants ignore. Stunning and colorful bar - my husband liked the large selection of craft beers as well. The two TVs flanking the bar though did seem out of place.

For a starter, the shrimp cocktail is a great choice: presentation is really cool with the dry ice vapor, the shrimp are HUGE and the sauce is good. For an entrée, I went with the filet. Instead of their regular rub which contains gluten, they will season it with salt & black pepper. It was a huge portion (had I known, I would have ordered the small filet) and it was cooked well and they even did a butterfly cut to ensure it cooked through. I also ordered a side of green beans with sliced almonds - tasty & fresh however, there were no almonds... 

Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and did a great job of checking up on us despite a busy Saturday night.  He was even nice enough to bring out some chocolate covered strawberry with whipped cream on the house to celebrate my husband's birthday which was even more thoughtful because he made sure it was a dessert I could eat given my gluten-free diet.

We had an awesome time, with superb food and drinks and top of the line service. Would highly recommend for a nice dinner, but be prepared to spend at least couple of hundred dollars on this indulgence!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited mastro's and was very impressed. I got the ribeye and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. My wife got the brussel sprouts. She said they were great. The bathroom was like none that I've ever been to before. This was one of the best steakhouse experiences I've ever had. The only let down was it was very loud and the tables were very close to each other."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas-Mastro's ranks among our top dining experiences anywhere in the world.  On this Labor Day Weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by Shauna, our Culinary Captain Extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  Turns out... our \"Terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.

Shauna introduced us to Mastro's participation in \"Las Vegas Restaurant Week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-Square Food Bank in Southern Nevada.  She offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by Beefsteak Tomato & Onion Salad, an 8 oz. Petite Filet, Creamed Spinach & Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Key Lime Pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.  

As there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and Shauna's recommendations. She perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful Riesling, Cabernet, and Sauvignon Blanc.

Sooo, included in the culinary delight were: The Legendary Seafood Tower (Ohhh YES!!), Lobster Bisque (best in class!), Herb Roasted Chicken (delightful), New York Strip (absolute perfection), Chilean Sea Bass (sweet & outa this world), Sautéed Sea Scallops (Oh Yeah!), Creamed Corn (buttered and seasoned to perfection), Sautéed Mushrooms ( a fav of favs), Roasted Brussels Sprouts (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. Baked Potato (huge), Triple Chocolate Layer Cake (nothing but delish), AND...(drum roll)... the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake!!...once again to die for!!!

Without fail, and to paraphrase the writings of T. Scott Gross,... Mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  Shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  It doesn't get any better!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  For sure.  My husband had swordfish, I had one of the best Chilean Sea Bass dishes on the planet.  The sides were too good.  Our waiter was good.  The place was too loud but ok.  Super trendy atmosphere.

BUT the front desk and reservations were the WORST!  Two young twenty year olds couldn't be bothered to stop talking to each other long enough to check us in for our 9:15 dinner reservation.  We were 30 minutes early and prepared to go the bar.  They said they would come and get us and gave us no warning they were behind.  At 9:30, I went and found them, they told me there were at least 8 couples ahead of us and it would be another 45 minutes.  To make matters worse it was our anniversary and my firefighter husband needs to eat to keep up with his work outs.  I told them that and they couldn't have cared less.  In fact, they started to talk to me like it was my big night out at the prom.  In my business, I have taken client groups to dinner there over a dozen times.

In the end, they treated us so badly my husband refused to let me use a $500 gift card a friend had given me as a gift because he wanted to make sure they knew he could pay on his own.  How dare anyone treat us that poorly.  Their loss.  My business, and our COMBINED income and business will go else where.  And being a fire fighter is a brave contribution, not something to be looked down on."}
{"text":"Since I had a good experience at the Mastro's Steakhouse in OC, I decided to try this Mastro's Ocean Club in Las Vegas and let me tell you, I had an even better experience.  It's probably due to the fact that I LOVE SEAFOOD!!!

I was tempted to get an appetizer tower but there were other things on the  menu that I wanted to try that were actually served hot so we opted out of the tower.  Instead we ordered the following:

*Seared Ahi Tuna - (just as good as the first time I had it in OC)
*Sauteed Sea Scallops - 3 pieces of jumbo scallops with three pieces of bread, in a rich creamy sauce.  AMAZING!!!  I just found out I'm moderately allergic to scallops but I love jumbo scallops so it doesn't stop me from trying them anyways. SOO YUMMY.
* Chilled Alaskan King Crab Claws - came out served is a cool bowl with dry ice.  Loved it.  Way A lot more tasty than shrimp cocktail or lobster option.  

This was definitely more than filling but it didn't stop me from ordering a Chilean Sea Bass for my entree since my favorite fish are chilean sea bass or cod anything.  I'm use to ordering these type of fishes miso style but since it wasn't an option, I decided to order it pan seared.  It came out nice fluffy and buttery.  I ordered it cooked medium.  I really liked the consistency of the fish and how it was cooked but wouldn't have minded some type of sauce to give that extra umph.

To be honest, I couldn't enjoy it as much because I was so stuffed!  I really wanted to try the infamous warm butter cake but I guess I'm just going to have to wait it out until the next time.  I will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Five stars! Amazing food. The customer service is awesome. Our waiter was very helpful explaining the menu and helping us make our choices. Portions are large and perfect for sharing. You can also order half orders of pretty much everything."}
{"text":"Wow this place is AWESOME! We ate here two nights in a row while visiting from Chicago on work-related travel. The servers and entire staff were so accommodating and just beyond welcoming. 

Both nights we started off with the seafood tower- wow just amazing seafood- shrimp, lobster, oysters and amazing atomic cocktail sauce. On the first night I had the filet and it was truly one of the best filets i have ever had. i have dined at some of the best steak houses around and this really was one of the best. On the 2nd night I had the sea bass and it too was great- but if you love both go for the filet (or find someone to share a piece of meat and fish with you)- it melts in your mouth! Also all of the sides are great too- lobster mashed potatoes, creamed spinach , sautéed asparagus and mac & cheese just to name a few were standouts. For dessert , of course we sampled a little bit of everything! butter cake is to die for, the chocolate torte, pudding cake, key lime- they are all so delicious! The food was just amazing and i am so excited that Mastros is coming to Chicago later this year. The staff that really stood out were Lloyd, Christopher and Mike- they were all so friendly! if only i lived in phoenix---- guess I'll just have to wait for ours to open!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience from top to bottom.  Outstanding in everyway.  Even the gentleman posted in the Men's room was super classy!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, excellent food. Our waiter Nick made a great night even better!"}
{"text":"I would like to sincerely thank Jacob for helping me, over the phone, to surprise my friends who were celebrating their upcoming nuptials.  My friends had checked in on social media, and I wanted to surprise them with drinks or dessert.  Jacob kindly searched the restaurant until he found them (they didn't have a reservation) and sent over dessert immediately.
Jacob - they were so surprised and thrilled!  Thank you so much for making this wonderful trip for them even better.  I can't express how grateful I am for your amazing kindness."}
{"text":"Waiting 45 min past reservation, while being told several times you're up next is unacceptable. They over crowd and generate extra income in the bar.  Then would you like still water... Yes, but you might mention its $9 bottle .. Good food but not worth the attitude and delays"}
{"text":"Came in tonight for steak after having been to other locations of Mastro's before.

I ordered the 12oz filet medium and sides, but unfortunately the filet comes a little bit over cooked. Still flavorful and very good meat, but not exactly the way I wanted it. The staff offered to cook another steak, but that wasn't really an option as I didn't feel like waiting.

Soon the manager approaches me and insists on taking it off the bill, even though I would have been willing to pay for it. Great customer service - \"we just want it to be perfect\".

No question I will come back."}
{"text":"This place consistently has great service and great scene. Excellent seafood and steaks. They feed as well as entertain with great food presentations. Overall a great vibe and is on my usual rotation of places to have great business dinners. Not cheap, in fact downright expensive. My biggest complaint is the wine mark up. They have a great wine selection but seem to press new limits of how much you should mark up wine. 
Save your money then go to Mastros to blow it all on good food and a good time."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mastros in So CA and Scottsdale and was very excited when this place opened, however, the location and ambiance (treehouse in the mall?) of the new LV Mastros is a little strange and does not compare to other locations.  I will not return because of this.
Seafood tower, pretzel bread, gorgonzola mac n cheese and bone in rib eye are all wonderful choices."}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent. We tasted each other's main courses and I liked the fish better than the steak (I ordered the boned fillet). The lobster mashed potatoes and their signature desert (butter cake) is an absolute must."}
{"text":"Ok, so my other half was raving about this place based on various peoples' opinions....we tried it out on vacation and I wasn't that impressed...the place itself is beautiful and innovative...but the food and service left much to be desired

It was decent at best, the appetizers were blah...we ordered sweet potato fries (totally can't mess those up) but the alleged \"vanilla crusted something shrimp\" were just plain old fried shrimp with no hint of vanilla anything...my steak (filet) was cooked ok but hers was supposed to be prepared medium-well but came out talking to us...

My biggest complaint was the service of our waitress...she literally rushed us like I've never been rushed before and I was born and raised in NYC...I was chewing my so- called \"vanilla\" shrimp when she brought out our steaks... with our appetizer plates still half full...

I think it was way too pricey ($250 spent) for 2 people (included a $50 bottle of wine)

We wanted to try the buttercake for dessert but felt so rushed that we left very annoyed...Such a high quality place needs to be stricter when choosing wait staff...not to mention another young couple next to us complaining about the same problem of being rushed and the place was not busy that night so it wasn't like they needed those deuce tables..."}
{"text":"Amazing food.fabulous service.I had king crab legs and lobster mashed potatoes.friends had filet min and ribeyes cooked perfectly. Do go treat yourself"}
{"text":"Just wanted to let people know that this place is not good for intimate dates. We went there for a nice Valentine's Day meal and were sorely disappointed. Not only was it extremely loud, they had packed tables into the dining room to accomodate more people. I could barely hear my boyfriend when we were trying to have a conversation.

The food was fine but I think for the price of the meal, we have definitely had better food and better dining experiences.

BUT this place is fun to sit in the bar area and listen to the piano players, much much better for a group dinner than a romantic date."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Very loud and noisy. Appetizers delicious but rest not worth it. Mashed potatoes with lobster very little flavor. Had to turn it a lot. It was bland. Steaks ok. Not worth the price. Not once did anyone ask how our food was. Ceasar salad not cold at all. If you want to spend that kind of money go to Donavan's or Mortins"}
{"text":"Went in expecting a decent experience in vegas......came out with wonderful reviews and I could not have asked for more. So let's not be generic and give detailed reviews. To start. I can not give a better, more glowing review for our server, Valerie Bynan. Notice please that I listed her name because she made a great meal amazing. Wonderful advice without being pushy, delightful enthusiasm and just in general a wonderful person. I had the scallops and the ahi tarte...both delish and cooked to perfection. The scallops were cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. My complements to the chef. We heard the butter cake was great and let me say.....try it. Simple. Amazing. Savory. I loved every bite! I give five stars and I am very picky, detail oriented and do not give five stars easily!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite steakhouses. The only part missing for me in regard to this location is atmosphere. The two Arizona locations and the Beverly Hills location have an intimate atmosphere. I find this open air mall location distracting."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club was a huge disappointment.  Hugely expensive but absolutely nothing special.  Fish was very bland and you can tell the place is trying to look \"upscale\" and \"high class\" when it really is not.  Service was marginal.  Eddie V's , a fish place just down the road is 5x as good, better service, and cheaper.  In fact, I had a better piece of fish at sur la table during a cooking class a couple weeks ago.  This is a place for the Westin vacationing snobs; it's a place your grandparents would go...if you're younger and appreciate taste and flavor more than large portions, Eddie V's is way better.  DON\"T GO TO MASTROS AND WASTE YOUR $!!"}
{"text":"Decor was very nice, cool tree house in the mall.   

Service lacked as it was very slow and took a long time to get the bill...

Portions were HUGE,  wish we knew that before ordering because no one finished their meal and what a waste since we were out of town.  I hope the bus boy ate my wifes left over chicken.  It was a whole chicken it looked like!!  But it was sure good...

My wife did not like the live music nor the singer, she looked good, but really did not sound good.  Plus they ruined a classic REM song. 

Overall ok and a bit over the top, would I go back?  no..."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for a business dinner through Open Table on Sunday June 5th for 8:30pm. At 7:35pm I received a call that they had technical difficulties in the kitchen and that they were only able to serve cold appetizers, salads and desserts. So we opted to go to a different restaurant(which was quite a task).
Hence my surprise when I got an e-mail from Open Table a day later that informed me that Mastro's reported me as a \"no show\".
You inform me 55 minutes before my reservation time that you are unable to fulfill my request and then have the nerve to report me as a \"no show\"?
Needless to say that I won't come back and will take my business elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the dining room- but we went in here and sat at the bar the weekend before Valentine's Day and I was super impressed by the friendliness and efficiency of the bartenders considering they were CRAZY BUSY. Like 3 people deep, crowds around the bar, and constant tickets printing for drinks in the dining room busy.

The wine list is ludicrously expensive, but the food and drinks are always on point at Maestro's concepts. Just go in expecting to spend over $100... for yourself. ;-)"}
{"text":"As always, Mastro's does not disappoint! Their food tasted just as I remembered it, AMAZING. The service we received was great! I love how attentive they are with everything! 

We got the Chef's special - Ribeye with Maine Lobster and let me tell you, the food was so delicious. 
They also comped their famous Butter Cake since it was our Anniversary. 

Being that we've dined at their Beverly Hills location, this place seemed a bit more casual and less romantic since it's inside a mall."}
{"text":"Ate there last night and the seafood was fresh and priced well.  The bread was \"ok\" but the food was verty good.  A++ . A must try in Vegas"}
{"text":"Went here last week and was a bit disappointed about the location.. it was like eating in a food court. Granted we did sit in the tree house but that was only after requesting we move our table and make it clear when the reservation was made that it was a \"very special night\" upon which we were stuck in the very back corner...gee thanks guys! I would like to say the Seafood Tower was incredible, although I would prefer the food on there chilled and not frozen, that was not so great. Steak was epic which boosted the rating to 3 stars. Overall, not where I would go again while in Vegas, I will leave Mastros for those who do it best in California."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and always end up getting the Chilean seabass!  Best tasting fish I ever had!  I believe it's about $40 just for the fish itself, but oh my it's worth eating good fish and having it prepared right.  I love the diff. bread options they give you off the bat- cheese, pretzel, mini baguete, and some other kind.  You have to order the sides separately, so whatever you get don't get the lobster mashed potato...not worth it.  Cant taste any lobster for that price!  Giving it only 4 stars since i haven't tried much of the other main entrees."}
{"text":"Delicious food, a special occasion restaurant for sure!"}
{"text":"As a party planner, I do not gratuitously provide 5-Star Ratings. However, I believe Mastro's Ocean Club to be the perfect location for an intimate dinner party in Las Vegas. We booked the private rooms upstairs for a reception and sit-down dinner for a party of 40 on Saturday, September 15, 2012 and our discerning guests who came from all around the country could not have been more pleased with the entire experience.  We were expertly guided from start to finish by Carly Smith, Director of Events. Carly was assessable, professional, flexible and an essential resource regarding local vendors to compliment the comprehensive services offered by Mastro's.  The ambiance was charming and elegant... photos of the gorgeous chandeliers, golden leather seats and flat screens which are viewable on their website, do not do this venue any justice.  We were in full view of the delightfully lit Tree House and even the restrooms which came with very courteous attendants, were a pleasant surprise. Their technology is also top of the line. All we needed to do was bring our slide show on a flash drive and our iPad playlist and our music soared through the rooms and our slideshow displayed brilliantly on two flat screens. Mastro's provided all of the equipment and cords and made it easy for us to make our party truly surround sound fun!  No event is a success without delicious food and this is where Mastro's clearly shines brightly. We started with an extraordinary Seafood Tower and Brochetta during the reception. Guests could not get enough of the Colossal Shrimp and Split/Chilled Alaskan King Crab Legs and the wait staff kept everyone's wine glass full which added to the fun and excitement during the reception. As we moved into dinner, the asparagus tempura seemed to disappear from the tables as guests ordered their choice of salads and entrees. And, talk about entrees...the generous portions of prepared-to-order salmon, chicken, steak or sword fish provided additional shock and awe. Even the side dishes, sautéed mushrooms, sautéed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. In addition to Carly Smith, we also have the highest praise Sherie Ritzler, General Manager, Brandon S., Banquet Captain, as well as, L.R, Alex and all of the wait staff and hostesses."}
{"text":"Mastros is the best fine dining restaurant for the fairest price on the Strip. They're not over priced like all the other fine dining restaurants in Vegas. The lobster bisque and Arctic char are delicious! A must try in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Menu is 2/3 fish and 1/3 steak. Get the lobster gnocchi with truffle oil side dish.  The tuna tar tar appetizer is the best I've had.  When you order a martini, they give you the shaker with more booze in it, so one martini is really two!  Pretzel bread is a must-have.  Top-notch service to boot."}
{"text":"I have literally nothing bad to say from the hostess stand to the wait staff to the supporting crew... our server Elizabeth was so awesome ...the food was superb"}
{"text":"Okay so the food is excellent!! Hands down love it everytime. But the music is always SO loud it makes sitting in the bar/lounge area impossible. Make sure to book ahead as they are always booked, but worth the money if you can get a table in the dining room."}
{"text":"I think I am in the twilight zone after reading the other reviews.  just dropped 4 bills here on my silver anneversay dinner for 4 - no wine either.   Service and atmosphere were great.  however this did not make up for the food.  I would give it 2.5 stars.  appetizers we had were calimari and Boston clam chowder.  the sauce that came with the calimari was not good.  The calamari was above average.  the soup seemed to lack a good seafood stock so flavor was absent although it had a good amont of clams.  we ordered two sides with dinner.   lobster mash potatoes was a good size serving but the lobster chunks were swimming in a puddle of butter.  could get the texture of th lobster meat but not too much on the flavor side.  string been were better bu similar.   I had the artic char.  seemed to lack flavor likely more than a day old.  sauce was tasty but I love the flavors of really fresh fish.  My wife had Chilean sea bass.   I had a bite at the end.  it was fishy like an old fish.   I have this dish often and this was the worst I have had.  I couldn't eat desert after this.   My kids had a new York steak and rack of lamb.  both were not cooked well and we're tough.  I am pretty sure I could have kicked as on the chef for these dishes.   the rack of lamb did have a good serving portion.  I was hoping I could be more positive and considered that my palate could be off because of something I ate earlier.  however the Chilean sea bass had some good flavors but was overpowered by bad fishy flavors."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Atmosphere was swanky, very upscale and yet too dark for me.
Went there for my birthday dinner and got the comp butter cake. Overall, meal was delicious. The chilean sea bass delivers! The bf got the seared tuna which was huge. Oysters-to die for. The bread basket- fab! The appetizers are plenty- we got the sweet potato fries, didn't expect that it could serve 10! Overall a great experience. Well worth the $$$ for special occasions."}
{"text":"This place is home to some of best food I've ever had in my life! From the escargot to the steaks and seafood"}
{"text":"The perfect place for a great steak!  No matter which location we visit they are all a great experience.  The butter cake is a must have, tell them you are celebrating something and it's free!!

The Mac and cheese is a must try, not for the calorie counters.  Cocktails are awesome.

This is not the place if you are on a budget but a great place for the special occasion.  

Even with all of the choices in Las Vegas Mastro's is always at the top of our list."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. The atmosphere & food is amazing. My husband and I absolutely love celebrating birthdays & Anniversaries here."}
{"text":"We didnt get to sit in the treehouse, but we were nearby about two tables away.

This was on my  Bookmark before I even touched foot in LV, and only reserved here because we stayed another night and needed a destination. I was hesitant because I've seen postcard-type ads for this place at CES, and I believe that places that need to advertise aren't the best. Opentable also promoted it with extra points.

Anyways, OpenTable showed same day availability for party of 5, so I booked it anyways, no cost booking and I could cancel if I found a better place.

We were seated promptly at the reservation time, no need for a lengthy wait like the previous restaurants this past week. Mastro's wasnt that busy when we arrived, although it did once 8:30p rolled around.

We ordered our entrees and sides. However I did not know the entrees come as that, with the sides making the dish. What I also didn't know was the production involved once dinner arrived....

The production went as follows, you get one or two servers serving the entrees, then a supporting team of servers go around putting sides on your entree plate. I believe we had six servers, in a high paced whirlwind headturning array of food being served onto our plates.

The $37 lobster mash potato was alright, but having a similar $15 smaller portion lobster mash at N9NE the previous night, I would skip Mastro's and go for N9NE's.

I would skip the Au Gratin Potato, it was nothing more than potato with cheese melted on top, not what I expected.

Creamed spinach was good. 

Yes, the booze is marked up.

All told, of the three dinners I had in LV, this ranked third."}
{"text":"This place is busy, had live music in the bar, and the servers were trying to squeeze by.  The seafood is flown in DAILY and I think our bill helped fund a grouper or two's first class seat.  I ordered the grouper with crab on top (as an extra- you can ask for it this way).  Ordered the lobster mashed again, and green beans (if it ain't broke- don't order something else.).  Had a great night!"}
{"text":"I ate here during my trip to Vegas in December. It was a great experience.

Service from beginning to end was excellent. Waiter was very nice and even scooped some food into my plate when the plate was getting emtpy lol. There was also a guy playing the piano and singing so that was nice too.

I ordered the filet mignon steak and I have to admit, it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. I'm from New Orleans and I have tried all the top steakhouses here like Mortons and Dickie Brennan's but Mastro's tops them both. Meat was tender and was full of flavor. 

Pricewise, it is pretty expensive but that is to be expected. Steak was about 55 bucks, sides were about 15 for me. G/f ordered a mixed drink that turned out to be 17 bucks. Total bill for 2 people was around 140.

I highly recommend this place if you want a classy place to eat in Vegas"}
{"text":"Make no mistake, This place is AWESOME.  The service was excellent, the menu has lots of unique offerings (The lobster mashed potatoes are unreal).  Everything was flavorful and prepared perfectly.  I had a bone-in Ribeye.  It was seasoned well and cooked to perfection.  It was not the best steak I have ever eaten, but it was up there.  The drinks are aggressively poured (for what they cost, they certainly should be). Dessert was equally impressive and the attentiveness of the wait staff was some of the best I have ever seen.  The dining experience as a whole was in my top 5.  I very strongly recommend this place if you are seeking a top notch dinner in las vegas.  That said, be forewarned that it is also in the top 3 most expensive dinners I have ever had.  The entrees are not really that exorbitant, but when you tie in a side like lobster mashed potatoes for $40 and multiple alcoholic beverages, it gets expensive in a hurry.  Although expensive, the entire experience makes it worth every penny."}
{"text":"Second time eating at this location in Las Vegas. Really enjoyed our meal and service was outstanding. While Mastros is an expensive restaurant, I genuinely feel there is great value all around here. Food is very high quality and well prepared. Drinks are generously poured and professionally mixed. The Hawaiian ahi and butter cake were the standout menu choices from this meal at Mastros."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are fantastic.  The entertainment is awesome.  I go to Ocean Club to dance and to listen to Marlee Taylor.  She ROCKS!  The atmosphere is great.  The gal in the bathroom is a sweetheart.  She always has a smile on her face and greats me with a big huge."}
{"text":"Went for a special dinning experience last night at their Las Vegas location . We typically dine at the Crystal Cove location in Orange County, CA. Very consitstant at what they do. Here, the experience was very different. 

We sat next to the bar in one of tgeir high tables. Started with an Escargot appetizer. However, the appetizer did not come with the Escargot schells which defeated the purpose of the experience of working your way through this delicatessen in anticipation of savoring your find. We have been dining at Matro's for 15 years and always order Escargot on schells. That is how is served!

All along the waiter kept pressuring us to order something else to drink besides water! The next appetizer was seared ahí tuna, which was overly spiced and was no presented well..

Some how the waiter probably felt we were not worthy of her service, so we caught her drinking beer with other customers at the next table over.

We decided not to order anything else and asked for the check which came 20 minutes later. As far as we were concerned this venue does NOT maintain its reputation and status consistantly across other locations.  Very disappointed, to say the least."}
{"text":"Hooray pretzel bread!

Great steaks and sides, can't go wrong with Mastro's."}
{"text":"I gotta go 5 stars. The spicy horseradish that comes with the shrimp cocktail is the best I have ever had. Simply incredible! Everything here is very very good. It is probly the most expensive place on the strip though, make sure you save your pennies! LOL. Also try the crab cake, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Cannot say enough great things.  From the 400 degree plate that keeps your steak warm for the entire meal...to the impeccable service staff...A+ all around.  Seafood tower was divine.  Worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Truly enjoyed all aspects of dining here. The dungeness crab was excellent, and our steaks were cooked perfectly. I could probably do without the 400 degree plate. It's Vegas, I really didn't need anything to make the evening warmer. The service was attentive, and the wine selection was nice.  I will definitely stop in at the new location Chicago to sample more of their appetizers and fish selections."}
{"text":"The $100 up charge on the credit card was resolved through the diligent work of AMEX and it looks like the manager is the one who padded the bill after we finished dinner. So apologies go out to deon because the vitriol should be directed to the manager. Aside from that, this was one of the most perfect dinner experiences that I've had in a while in Vegas. I received an email from someone in corporate but have had no follow up after that. A gift certificate or something would have been nice because they certainly f***ed up."}
{"text":"Ok,it's not cheap!

Pretzel bread and bread 
basket the best.
Spicy Mambo Salad,unique and flavorful,

Put it on the credit card and enjoy."}
{"text":"This was by far the best meal and dining experience we had in Las Vegas. Daniel our waiter and the rest of the staff were very helpful, attentive, accommodating and professional. I highly recommend Mastro's  to anyone looking for an excellent meal and dining experience."}
{"text":"My husband & I chose this spot to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and we are still reeling from the experience!!  Absolutely one of our best dining experiences EVER!!
For starters, we requested Mike R as our server due to the many good things we read here and he didn't disappoint. Made our dinner and all round experience very memorable. 
Everyone made us feel so special from the hostess to the busboys. 
Oh, the food!!  We knew the portions were reportedly large and Mike encouraged us to order half portions. We had half Spicy Mambo Salad - Caesars salad with horseradish and wasabi - really yummy with a nice kick to it and lots of chunks of Parmesan. We loved it!
My husband had the 12 oz filet and I had the 12 oz bone-in filet. Both were done to perfection and very flavorful. 
Mike suggested ordering only one side to split. My husband can't resist fresh fries, especially with steak, so we got the salt & vinegar fries. They were so good and so addictive, we couldn't stop eating them even though we were stuffed. 
Then came dessert!  Special occasions get comp dessert here, but Mike went over and above for us as he said he had never served anyone celebrating a 40th wedding anniversary before. We not only got the warm butter cake with ice cream and a hugh side dish of fresh made whipped cream (and yes it is every bit as good as reported), he added 4 hugh chocolate covered strawberries and 2 glasses of an amazing appertif- Michele Chiarlo Nivole. 
A truly awesome evening we will never forget!  Oh, and they called us the next day to thank us for coming!
We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We sat in the tree house; very cool atmosphere although the mall brought it down a bit. Food was very good as was the service. A notch below the SW steakhouse."}
{"text":"Really Nice View and great food. nice break from the strip when it's 9:30 at night and the temperature finally gets down to 99 degrees. lol"}
{"text":"I've been to ocean club now more than a few times. Every time I leave with mixed feelings! Their seafood is second to none, and they go out of their way to ensure it's freshness! Thier steaks are by far the best I've ever had, as with all their resturants. I have to say it again Mastro's steaks are the best!!!!! Service is unbelievable! The resturants is beautiful and elegant, you really get the feeling that you are dining somewhere special! However, there is something about the energy there that bothers me. I have a hard time putting my finger on it, but pretentious is the word that comes to mind! It's definatly a place to experience especially if you have never been, but I'm happy visiting only once a year!"}
{"text":"I came here for Thanksgiving day dinner and I was really surprised.  I've always been a fan of Mastro's, especially the Beverly Hills location but I hadn't been to their Ocean Club before.  I decided to go with seafood since that seemed to be their specialty and I was really impressed.  The blue point oysters were extremely fresh and for the main course I ordered the scallops which were huge and cooked to perfection. For dessert I ordered Mastro's signature butter cake which is always good.
Our waiter was very entertaining and the service was beyond exceptional.  The washroom attendant was very cheerful despite having to be in there on Thanksgiving day. 
Thanks for the wonderful meal I will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"Called ahead to see if reservations were necessary, hostess said 9:15 pm is earliest res...but at 6:30 kids and wife were hungry!
Heard good things, so really wanted to try this place...glad we decided to walk over and take our chances...pleasantly Sat down right away in high booth...

Ordered 1 half dozen oysters and a few crab claws...wow, best claws ever, as fat as Tabasco bottle! Sweet n meaty too!
Server (Dalin) was excellent, made a mistake on our app order and punched in 6 half dozen oysters instead of the 1 half dozen...and when the tower came out, told us he made an order mistake and just said go eat as many as we can...36 oysters! 3 diff types, inc kumamotos, cushies from BC and the best Misty Points ever! First  time a server made mistake and left it on the table! We woulda totally understood if they pulled it off the table, but happily surprised to indulge...

Then came the fish...swordfish pan seared to perfection and sea bass that was breaded and baked...think of the biggest, tastiest  scallop you've had in your life...in a crispy, flaky, juicy...forget your name Ono form!
Winner! Best, most memorable dining experience we've had!

This may have been the best meal experience so far"}
{"text":"Dined at Ocean Club last night. This was a special occasion celebrating my daughter's successful fight against her second unique cancer diagnosis in the past three years.

Ocean Club has been my designated special occasion restaurant since it opened. It is also a routine dining choice for business dinners. I have probably dined here over twenty times and it has generally never failed to impress. This time was no exception.

For this visit I had a 6:15 reservation. I booked the previous afternoon and was somewhat surprised to score a reservation. On a couple of previous attempts over the past few months, I was shut out by waiting so long. Arrived a bit early, the place was already packed. No worries as we were quickly shown to our four top. On another pleasant and somewhat surprising note, my daughter and her boyfriend arrived almost on time.

Our waiter for the evening was a pleasant woman,who may or may not have mentioned her name. Interesting to have a female for a waiter. All of my previous meals here were handled by male waiters. This always seemed to be a part of the \"professional\" schtick for the Ocean Club. Nevertheless, the service was very professional.

Dove right into the wine list. Ocean Club handles wines like most steak houses. There is the really expensive list that is contained within the menu and then there is the \"off the charts\" expensive list contained in its own book. I stuck with the really expensive list. My goal for 2012 was to stop drinking the same wines all the time. I found a 2009 Piatelli Malbec from Argentina and went with that. Cost: $60.00. I was really happy with the selection. Very drinkable. Side note: This wine can be found for as little as $15.00. A markup of four times is a joke.

Ordered a whole main lobster and some stone crab claws as a starter. As I noted earlier this was a celebration! Everyone ordered Filets. We also had the sea salt & vinegar fries and the sugar snap peas. The sides are always huge. One order of anything will easily feed four. The meal was good. Interesting though, as for the first time ever I think the steaks were over seasoned. A tad too much salt. All four of us noted this.

Finished the meal with desert comp'ed by waiter as she noted our celebration. Final tab came in at over $100 per person.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Of all the Mastro's I've been this is my favorite! The one in Beverly Hills, CA is great as well but the environment is way different and the service is less good.

I always order the same: -oysters (Kumamoto) and shrimp cocktail (huge and delicious) with lots of fresh horse radish. 

- sometimes I get the clam chowder which is amazing but I have to say it's very buttery and heavy.

- bone in steak. I always order the small one with a side of veggies.

I don't usually like sweets but you can't get out of there without trying the Butter Cake desert! 

This Mastro's has so far the best live music, usually some blonde girl that sings really good and a guy at the piano. And the staff is extra friendly."}
{"text":"A culinary delight!  Started off with the beefsteak tomato and mozzarella salad.  Chose the salmon blackened for dinner and shared a mountain of sweet potato fries and the cream corn.  For desert I ordered the butter cake which topped the meal off perfectly!  The Mastro's Martini is a must have if you like martinis.  Don't be scared off by the $19.00 price...they bring the shaker out and it fills the glass three times!  Superior service.  A great evening out!"}
{"text":"Oysters Rockefeller, Escargot, Ahi Tuna tar tar... and lobster mashed potatoes with CHILEAN SEA BASS (oh, how I loved you!). This is a perfect menu. The place is beautiful, food is amazing, service is impeccable - this is Mastro's. GO."}
{"text":"Always a good experience at this place.I hope my hubby surprises me this year again and we end up at Mastro's having strawberries and that home made cream"}
{"text":"Mediocre steak (for this level place). Great lobster. Unimpressive decor overlooking mall. Very good Mac & Cheese (though not best). Extra large dessert, with great whipped cream."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant.  Great food (pretty expensive), and jumping.  Pretty loud, too.

Now, after dinner...different story.  

Descend into the bar area (live band, etc.) and you'd better be careful.  Why?  There are more cougars in this joint than you'd find in Yellowstone or Yosemite...combined!  RAWWRR!  I had an absolute blast having fine drinks and just watching the give-and-go between the seasoned hotties and their prey."}
{"text":"Visited this superb restaurant on Sunday.  Hostess & Wait staff were terrific.  The menu is a little bit overwhelming, but my friend highly recommended the bone in Filet.  SO I think more than half or our party of 10 did just that.  Also, the sides are served family style.  We had several different sides & all were delicious.

Just to let you know about the service.  I ordered the bone in filet medium and when I received it, it was bordering on well done.  When the waiter came back to the table (within a couple of minutes), he noticed that I was not eating and asked if there was a problem. I informed him that the filet was overcooked for my taste and he immediately picked it up and said he would bring out a 18 ounce (I had a 12 oz).  I told him that he did not need to do that, but he insisted.  

It did not take long for me to get my filet brought back out and this time it was perfect.  He apologized again.  I didn't think I could eat all of it, but after the first taste, I realized that I was not going to let this go to waste.  

If you go here, I would for sure get a reservation.  Also, be prepared to spend about $60 - $80 per person.  

Side note, one of our friends in the group had a birthday, and he was treated with this delicious chocolate moist cake.  I mean it was terrific.  It came with a big bowl of whipped fresh cream.  

If you are in Vegas, you need to try this place out.  I have eaten many steaks in Vegas, but this one has been the only one that has satisfied me.  

Dress code is business casual, but I am sure if you wanted to walk in with shorts and a t-shirt they will take your money."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I had the 8 oz. filet and asked for medium rare. When I got it, it was perfectly cooked and probably one of the best looking cut. Appetizers was very good as well and had the carpaccio, shrimp and mussels."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Mastro's for two reasons: (1) If possible, I would gorge myself to death on seafood; and (2) I wanted to eat in the weird looking treehouse in Crystals.

I got both (except for death...unless....).

The ambiance of this place is weird, to say the least.  A few tables are enclosed in a traditional restaurant space with, you know, walls.  The rest are inside the \"treehouse,\" a very cool, wood-slated structure dangling in the middle of Crystals.

Although very cool looking, it's VERY LOUD.  In between the awwfffulll live music (really, they need to stop that) and the echo of everyone's conversations (no walls = no muffling of noise), it's almost difficult to have a conversation.  I would say this is not a romantic spot to eat.  

There were also lots of middle-aged dudes in jeans.  Like, packs of them.  Very weird.

FOOD

As we were in a \"small plate\" mood, we went crazy on the appetizers as follows:

Sauteed Sea Scallops ($22)- Three medium-sized scallops, three slices of parmesan toast, diced tomatoes and cream sauce.  Unfortunately, the scallops were a tad overcooked and chewy. I'd probably pass on scallops next time.

Beef Bone Marrow (around $18) - two huge bones and baguette toast.   Delicious, decadent and full of flavor.  We gobbled it all up.

Seared Ahi Tuna encrusted in sesame seeds and served with julienned carrots ($22).  Overall, it lacked flavor although perfectly cooked. 

Wedge salad - ($12) Big portion and very good.  I liked that they didn't cover the iceberg in dressing and instead left it on the bottom of the plate, surrounding the salad.  This allowed the diner to control how much dressing on each bite.  The dressing was a tad watery, the way I like it. Well executed.  But, it's a salad, so......

Then we got a half and half side of the following (they give you a half portion of each to let you try everything ($38):

King Crab Black Truffle Gnocci - Salty, rich and so delicious.  Lots of king crab chunks. My favorite thing I tried.

Lobster Cheese Mashed Potatoes -Although rich, it wasn't that flavorful. Mostly salty, not complex. I did love the enormous pieces of lobster, though. 

I have to add they were really generous with the wine pour ($12 for a glass of Shiraz).

Overall, good service and big portions.  It's a bit pricey but they serve up some tasty food.  

Definitely come here if you're 40 and have a penchant for denim.  This is your mecca."}
{"text":"This is the best Maestro's by far! Sitting in the bar is my favorite and no reservation is needed. Start with the Seafood Tower, finish with the butter cake and a fantastic salad and bone in steak in between and you will be a happy camper! Honestly everything is fantastic here!"}
{"text":"YUM! The crab legs are always perfect, the filet always like butter, the pretzel bread always hot and the service impeccable! Amazing."}
{"text":"Second time at this location. As always solid from the taste and preparation of the steaks. 

This review is really for a more bizarre experience. Ordered a Manhattan which they pour table side into a martini glass. About 5 minutes into my drink the base of the glass literally explodes, splitting into several pieces. Luckily the drink landed on its stem and so none of the drink spilled. 

I immediately alerted the waiter to the bizarre situation. The handling of this was appropriate, but not great. First the waiter understandably seemed perplexed. After assessing the glassware myself I came to the conclusion it occurred because they had apparently chilled the martini glass; and as it came back quickly to room temperature it shattered. In any case, the waiter asked me if the drink was okay. Ha. Yes, the drink is fine. No glass made it into the drink. By the way I am fine too, no need worry there is little bits of glass in front of me. The waiter took away my glass to pour it into a new one which was again acceptable. Later on in the meal though I actually cut myself on a random tiny piece of glass that was left on the table cloth. Just my luck (no pun intended Vegas), but again its not the restaurant's fault. The cut was small and did not have to amputate so decided not to ruin the mood and make a big deal about the glass. However, ones expectations eating at an establishment like Mastros is high and the entire experience did not meet that expectation. 

Next time maybe my luck will be better. Until then beware of exploding glassware. Suggestion to Mastro's: do not freeze stemware."}
{"text":"Very amazing service food and drinks. From cali and looking for a great place with friends.  This was it.   Live band was mild and good listening.  Highly recommend this place.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Two of us dined at Ocean Club on a Tuesday night around 8pm. It turned out to be just about the perfect day and time as it was not too busy while also there was enough room for us to have our own space without another occupied table too near us. What can I say? I go for the food. I do not care to listen to other peoples conversations no matter who they are and what they do.

Let's talk food.

OK, that butter cake made me laugh like it had drugs in it. The combo of the warm sweet sugary cake with melting ice cream, fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream is so good that I'd not be surprise to learn that they secretly added some type of anti-depressants. 

The big surprise was just how crisp, sweet and perfectly delicious the snap peas were. I mean they are only veggies. How wonderful can they get. Well the answer is that they can be out of this world. Biting into one at a time was a carnival of blissful experiences. 

Our server was Eric and he had it down cold. He was experienced and seemed to possess a deep understanding of all food and drink. Eric knew just how to handle each customer in a unique way. I saw him adjust his approach with every table he visited. It is not often that you suspect you were lucky enough to get the best employee in the place. We talked at length with Eric and learned his secret to superior service. He has been a chef, sever, small business owner, etc. With a long and diverse background in food service, we really enjoyed his expertise. This is coming from me and I do not chat about personal stuff with the folks that bring out my food very often. Somehow Eric knew that it was OK on this night to talk with us like we were all old friends and I though it was fun.

My main  course was lobster and it was amazing as expected.

Overall, it was one of my best restaurant experiences in my entire life and I have dined at great spots in NY, Paris, Sedona and Miami.

The price could have been twice as much and I would have paid it with a smile."}
{"text":"Pros: 
-Great food (excellent steak, excellent seafood. The Iceberg Wedge salad has a smoked bacon that is really great. The tuna tar tar is also terrific and beautifully presented. And the Macaroni and Cheese side dish: fantastically flavorful, rich, creamy, delicious pot of cholesterol. Worth it!!) 
-Good drinks poured generously
-Very good service 

Cons:
-absolutely earsplitting music- so LOUD it's impossible to hold a conversation. In an attempt to create a high energy environment, they have eliminated any opportunity for enjoyable conversation, and drive out a lot of sophisticated people. Bad, bad, bad decision!! PLEASE just play some classy jazz at a reasonable volume or anything except that loud rock and roll. Really a detraction from the establishment's fine qualities, and honestly it ruined our meal. If the music doesn't get turned down, we'll never be back."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and two adult kids on recommendation from our Concierge at the Green Valley resort. The ceasar salad and warm spinach salad were perfect and they let you split portions. We had the salmon and three boneless filets with garlic mashed potatoes. Again they let us split the potatoes 4 ways. Steak and Salmon was some of the best that I ever had. Service was impeccable. Prices are very fair especially because they let you split the salads and sides."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting \"Mastro's\" for many years and tonight's meal was mediocre and that is being very generous. 
The cold Alaskan crab legs appetizer was fishy and mushy, the salads lacked any proper seasoning/dressing (after making note of this instead of taking them back and redoing, they just brought sides of dressing), and my medium rare steak came out blue, obviously needed longer. 
Our server was very nice and apologetic, but was not at the top of his game lacking knowledge particularly in wine and whisky. 
We spoke to the manager very politely who stood blanked faced. We were told our salads were taken care of and then offered the silly complimentary dessert as an apology, but we were long over this meal and place. 
I forgot to mention it was a special occasion, which they knew of when we made the reservation and they tried to sit us initially next to the service curtain/entrance to kitchen in a 1/4 full restaurant. It was a Sunday eve!!! 
What a disappointment we will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the sister restaurant of Mastro's Steakhouses.  This is a seafood restaurant, however they serve the same cuts as the steakhouses.

The service was impeccable, the food was also great.  Went here while on a business trip, so I didn't spend any of my money on it.  This place is expensive though.  The bill ended up being around one hundred and thirty bucks per person.  We were drinking though, so that probably added 20-30 per person.  

This is the kind of place where the waiter who serves you is 50 years old and has probably been waitering his whole life - and it shows.  Service was really great.

This is also the kind of place where there is a guy in the bathroom handing you towels.  Not a huge fan of that, but thought I should mention it.

Their bar is huge and stacked with anything you can imagine.  They also have a big screen TV in the bar.

I recommend it but it is a very expensive place (like all Mastro's Steakhouses)."}
{"text":"Have to say one of the top 5 meals I have every had. The service was great, sides were great, the Wagyu beef special was incredible. I would go back and highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went on Friday night to check out the bar and in doing so met a very friendly, helpful wait staff gentleman.  His name is Iggy, he is a native New Yorker and was very pleasant to speak with.  He made us feel very comfortable and even brought us out a bread basket after the kitchen had closed.  Kudos to Iggy for great customer service!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Mastro's by a friend of mine.  He had nothing but good things to say about it, so last year, we gave it a shot. Mastro's is the perfect hybrid of really good seafood and classic steakhouse.  When you walk in the first thing you smell is the juicy steaks coming out of the kitchen. This was our second time here and I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered. Lucky for us, it was just as good. I remembered that they had a nice wine list and they still do. Gramercy Guy was able to get Darioush (one of our favorite Napa wineries) by the glass, which is really hard to find. 

While our waiter was walking us through the menu, some specials, and suggestions, I zeroed in on a salad called, the Spicy Mambo, which is a take on a Caesar salad, without croutons but has horseradish and blue cheese crumbles. It was really tasty and I'm looking forward to going home and adjusting my Caesar dressing recipe with some fresh horseradish. 

A secret menu item is the Mastro's Mash. It used to be on the menu but has recently come off, if you ask, they will make it for you. It's like a loaded baked potato but mashed. We also got sauteed spinach, don't forget your greens.

The design of Mastro's is really amazing, they have what they call a 'tree house', a wooden structure that has two levels. The bottom is the Crystal's information desk and the top level is the Mastro's tree house. When we booked our reservation, we requested a table in the tree house. Once you step inside, the atmosphere totally changes, the band (which is really good) gets muffled and it's very relaxing and feels almost private (there are about a dozen tables).

My advice for anyone going to Mastro's...share...the portions are huge and unless you have a place to store your left overs, it will all go to waste. Also, the pretzel rolls in the bread basket are amazing.

{"text":"I was really expecting a fabulous dinner but I was truly disappointed. For an appetizer I ordered the sautéed shrimp. It was very good. I had the lobster tails for dinner. They were a bit over cooked and not sweet at all. For the price that was charged they should have been perfect. After reading the reviews of the butter cake, I was looking forward to it. Their desserts are so large that as one person I couldn't order it :(."}
{"text":"What isn't there to like about Ocean Club? I'd like to start off by saying this review is for the bar only. I'd rate the restaurant a little lower at about 3.5 or 4 stars. The bar is amazing. There is good live piano music and the cocktails are so good - might even be my favorite place for drinks in Scottsdale. Not only are the cocktails great, but the wine list is super extensive and you cannot go wrong with almost any choice.

It frustrates me when people review restaurant on yelp based on the drinks, so I want to clarify that Ocean Club not only has 5 star drinks it has 5 star food. The oysters are probably my favorite in all of Arizona, they are cleaned very well and always fresh, and how can you go wrong when they are accompanied by pretzel bread and garlic toasts!? The salads are also nice to have as well as the shrimp cocktail (they are more like little lobsters). The best thing on the menu thought? The Mac and cheese!!! 

You can't go wrong spending a Saturday night with a drink and some light food at the bar at Ocean Club. 

My only warning: it is an older crowd. So if that is something that turns you off, it might not be for you."}
{"text":"Sunday night hangout.  Everything from the service to the food and drinks is top notch, high quality, super fantastic."}
{"text":"So far, it's the best ribeye steak I've ever had.  Very juicy and tasty.  Can't go wrong with this dish."}
{"text":"If your looking to treat yourself or wine and dine someone this is the place to do it!  SO AMAZING, went here for my dad's 50th and we totally over indulged.  Cocktails-perfect and filled with booze, Seafood Tower-PERFECT way to start the meal, Wine-FLOWERS Pinot Noir is now added to my favorites list, Entrees all rocked....The Seared Tuna, Petite Fillet, Ribeye, White Salmon and the Seabass were soooooo tasty.  Next time I'm probably going to get the seared tuna-my mom won the dinner ordering battle ;) oh and our sides were fantastic!  get the mac n cheese-totally not the classiest thing on the menu but you will not regret it; we also got brussel sprouts and sweet potato fries :D 


so if you can't tell we REALLY indulged but it was worth it, every penny :) 

PS save room for the butter cake-just like Mastro's City Hall's and it will ROCK your Freaking world :)"}
{"text":"It was the top steak I ever tasted.... perfectly cooked as requested. All the food tasted great. It was even a better experience for me than their branch at Newport Beach
Service was excellent... our server was friendly and very helpful 
Would definitely come back for my next visit in Vegas"}
{"text":"Delicious Waygu for 2. Fantastic martini with dry ice! Great waiter who explained everything and made great recommendations. Perfect way to celebrate a birthday. All in all, everything was as it should be. We will be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"We sat in the bar area   Had a couple martinis and Kumomoto oysters and (super huge) shrimp cocktail.  Everything was wonderful!  The service here is absolutely fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were there for my mother's birthday 6 of us.  We enjoyed it until the food came.  My moms $80 lobster was extremely chewy, not buttery soft. Two of the steaks were medium rare until you got further in then they were blue.  My scallops were perfect.  Sorry we picked this place, needless to say will not be back."}
{"text":"Sorry, you just don't have it.  CRAFTSTEAK is much better.  Hands down.  First, you've got fifteen zillion workers just standing around.  Then when you all flip into action setting a table it is hysterical - too much commotion for other diners.  It was like Cirque de Soleil.  Shining flashlights on the glasses - meanwhile, i'm served my steak and NO ONE comes to ask if it is cooked correctly - it was not - it was mooing at me.  Anyway. won't be back and you'll be closed in a year."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for Mastro's for 12 people and they jammed us in a table for 8. It was extremely cramped and for a high end restaurant extremely uncomfortable. Service was okay, we were left with many empty glasses and I was left wondering if we actually had anyone attending to our large party. Food was just okay, for a $65 steak, it didn't turn out well. Very charred on the outside and tasted burnt for a medium steak. Did I mention service was subpar? 

I have been to Mastro's multiple times, this is my last visit. Take your business to another steak house, this place was not interested in repeat customers!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Excellent service from the time I called to make a reservation (because open table didn't show availability for the time I wanted) to the hostess to the wait staff. We ordered the filet and it was cooked to perfection! The garlic mashed potatoes and spinach were generous and the butter cake lived up to expectations. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went there to check out the venue for a private dinner.  The waitress was attentive and cordial.  The manager really turned my head because he called me after the meal with our small party.  What attentiveness!  The seafood tower was great as was the fish.  The steak delish~~~"}
{"text":"I have had the chance to visit Mastro's Ocean Club twice and both times were equally wonderful. Everything from the wait staff, ambiance and the food are all beyond amazing. 

Their service is probably as good as it gets. The hostesses are all very friendly in their greetings when you arrive. The wait staff is very attentive. I felt like I never had to flag someone down, there was always someone readily available. 

The energy in the restaurant is very nice. There was live music being played on a piano which helped to set the tone. The restaurant itself is set up in a modern tree house space located inside of the Crystal's shopping center. There is nice colorful lighting that helps set off the dark woods of the tree house and white table cloths of Mastro's.

The food though is the real star of the show. I had the 12oz filet and it was phenomenal. It was cooked exactly the way I like it. Perfectly seasoned. The other member of my party had the bone in rib eye which was just massive. The sides we ordered were more than enough to share. The side portions are a meal in themselves. Their mac & cheese is a must have! So are their sea salt & vinegar fries. If possible, save room for dessert. Their signature butter cake is by far one of the best desserts that I have ever had on the Las Vegas strip. I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary cake from the manager, so if I could, they would get an extra bonus star just for that.

All in all, Mastro's is a definite must visit. It's great for special occasions or even business dinners. It will become one of your new standards for what you expect in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Mastro's Ocean Club. We're not near the ocean in Las Vegas, but there are Mastro's on the water in SoCal. Had the bone in ribeye, absolutely mouth watering. Had Lobster Mashed Potatoes, which was a meal to itself. Giant sauteed mushrooms and I was in heaven. Outstanding service to boot. Great experience. It's not cheap, but it is a top of the line Strip restaurant."}
{"text":"What to say about this place. Wait staff was very nice and helpful. Seafood tower was great. The Caesar salad was ok. Steak was pretty good and the butter cake was so bad for you, good. I enjoyed the meal but can honestly say I don't care for the atmosphere, to corporate, and don't feel the cost was really worth it. I'm glad I got to experience it, but I don't think I'll be going back. I'll stick with the good small local places when I travel."}
{"text":"I love Mastro's and I believe that the Chicago location has the best service.  As for the Ocean's Club we expected the equal amount of attention and service but that did not occur.   As for our waitress we didn't appreciate the comedy show with her constant joking.  We were never asked for drink refills, coffee refills and plates were left on the table after we were finished.  When you pay that kind of money you expect a certain level of service. We will try it again but with a different server."}
{"text":"Went to Maestros as part of a regional get together with colleagues.  The ambiance was great, and the food was excellent.  By far my favorite part was the sea food tower, build it anyway you like, everything on there was so fresh I could hear waves crashing.  My steak was cooked exactly how I like it, and the wine flight pairing made for a nice compliment.  Only down side was because our party was somewhat large, and there was at least one other large party service was a little sparse and at one point we waited 15 min for someone to come around.  This is the only reason Maestros gets a 4 out of 5 in my book, however I will return as the food was just that good."}
{"text":"Went for a business dinner and had poor service and mediocre food. In our nearly four hour meal, we ordered only to be told they were out of such rare dishes as halibut and swordfish. Waiting nearly two hours for food to arrive the manager apologized that they were busy. Don't know why I thought a seafood restaurant might have fish. There are many great dining options in the area , this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"So I am sitting here at the table right now and we have had the most AMAZING experience. We came here in Saturday 10-14-17 to celebrate my mom's birthday (from Chicago) and decided to come back today 10-16-17 for a few drinks and dessert. The manager, Brandon, remembered us immediately and wished my mom a happy birthday and offered us a free dessert. We were shocked that not only did he recognize us, but he also remembered it was my mom's birthday. A few minutes later another manager, Aaron, comes up and brings my mom a free martini! It was such a shock and wonderful experience. We also had a super great waitress, Katie. Truly amazing customer service, better than I have experienced in a long time. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone thinking of coming! The food was also amazing! Great steaks and sides (best French fries I have ever had) and the most amazing butter cake. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Food + Service Was Awesome

We ordered The Shrimp Cocktail 20$ I'd rate it 3
Japanese Kobe Beef Steak 140$ Rate 4
Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese 14$ Rate A Perfect 5
Twin lobster tails 70$ Rate A Perfect 5!

Service was great!  Thanks Paul and craig.

Scenery Was The Best Part"}
{"text":"With our first visit,  everything was excellent except for one point. The main course, which was a 3 pound lobster which tasted tough.  

This newer second visit,  i must say the service dropped a notch.  

Food:
The salad & soup were nice.  
My chilean bass fish dish was ok
The Lobster mash was superb
The escargot was great
But the bone in ribeye 22 oz, for my guess was not good.  The reason being is, there was way too many tendon in the steak,  for a place like this,  which isn't cheap.  I would expect it from a steak at Outback, but not Maestro."}
{"text":"Came here last night for my anniversary dinner and it was fantastic. They gave us a really good table and the server was extremely nice. We love their oysters. Me and my husband ate 3 dozen before our meal. We got the sea bass which was amazing and the Kobe steak . I have no complaints. Our experience here was great as usual."}
{"text":"Celebrated my father's 70th birthday dinner here along with my wife and mother.

The food was excellent and the sides are HUGE.  The four of us ordered 3 sides and it was way, way, too much food.

We all had fish dishes on their menu and all were superb. 

Be sure you order their signature dessert.  Can't remember it's name but it is heavenly. 

Also, ask to be seated in The Nest and be sure you make reservations...the place will be packed.  

Finally, only one complaint - Their Hostess's need to LOSE the attitude!  Try looking up and making eye contact when someone walks in to check in."}
{"text":"Mastros is a great restaurant with a very cool dinning room built like a tree house. The wine list is very extensive and the service was great. 

Our main course was delayed for some reason & I was really unimpressed by my steak. It was good steak, but it was a bit dry and tasted like it had sat under a warmer while someone forgot to tell the expo guy. My wife's Lobster was overcooked and dry. We actually sent it back which is rare for me. 

All in all our meal was good, but not 5 star in my opinion."}
{"text":"One of the best meals that I have had in a long time.  Looking forward to repeating.  $300 for 2 for dinner."}
{"text":"Came with full anticipation of excellent service, great ambience and tasty dishes based on experiences shared by other Yelpers. Left with full satisfaction and lasting impression of a wonderful dining experience. Our table was located in a treehouse with chandeliers and white tablecloth; however, it did not feel stuffy, rather cozy and friendly, with top notch service. Cloth napkins were offered in either black or white color. Hot towels were distributed after we finished our seafood appetizers served icy cold with cool dry ice presentation (their signature seafood tower). Salted caramel martini is deliciously mixed and served in a salted rim glass. The portion is very generous, from the drink, to the bread basket (5 different types), as well as the entrée and side dishes. Collectively, everyone in our party was very pleased with their choices of entrees; e.g., Halibut, Arctic Char \"Oreganata\", Chilean sea bass, Vanilla battered lobster tails, Bone-in Ribeye. Side dishes were meant to be shared. The lobster mashed potatoes and Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi were very tasty with big chunks of lobster and crab. Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries were crispy and well-seasoned. The meal ended with the popular warm butter cake and key lime pie. We left in time for Caesar's Palace's Fourth of July fireworks, and others from various Station Casinos throughout Vegas. An epic meal ended with an impressive firework show. What a memorable Fourth!"}
{"text":"I've had a number of people recommend Mastro's in cities across the country, it wasn't until recently I realized there was a location right here at home. Oddly enough I was familiar with the space, but never put two and two together. It's the bird's nest, the unmistakable structure in the Crystals.

We were started with a huge bread basket. All of which was fresh and delicious. I also had the Strawberry Mule ($15), which was a refreshing twist on the moscow mule.

If I'm being honest, it was the Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($28) that swayed me to try Mastro's. It's my favorite crab and this was scrumptious. All the flavor, but without the fuss. It is served over dry ice so the presentation is rather striking.

With \"Ocean Room\" in the name I had to try the fish. I was tempted by the halibut on special, but I chose the Chilean Seabass ($49). It was a huge filet, that was moist and flaky. Surprisingly, their turf seems to be just as good as their surf, the husband had the Rack of Lamb ($49) and it was fantastic. I really like that the preparation is simple, just properly seasoned to allow the flavor of the meat to shine. We went for decadence when selecting our sides. I had to try the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ($33) and the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese ($14) piqued his interest. Both were rich, creamy and gooey. The crab in the gnocchi was too delicate for this dish it was overpowered by the creamy sauce and the bold truffle flavor. Both were mighty tasty, however.

We ate until we could eat no more, and there was a bunch leftover. Rarely do we have leftovers to box up, but it seemed like we hadn't even touched our sides. The portions are quite large and will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. We were much too full to attempt dessert. Their famous butter cake will have to wait. Service was attentive; overall, a really great experience. It's nice to have another option for seafood in the desert."}
{"text":"The drinks and food were fantastic. I had a nice verity and was happy with each dishes. 
I highly suggest the Lab chop"}
{"text":"Have you ever been called a day later from a restaurant you ate at the night before? Yeah, me neither- until I ate at Maestro's Ocean Room.  It was like a one night stand you want to call you again. Real classy joint. The whole family went to Vegas for Christmas. Since we are Jews, we decided to forego the stereotypical Chinese food and step it up a bit.  We were looking for a nice steakhouse and we were torn between Craft Steak or Maestros- Since we were staying at Vdara, Maestro's was closer.  Thank goodness- hands down best steak I've ever had. Even my picky eater girls loved it. I had the filet- melted in my mouth like butter.  We ordered the mussels, crab claws, bone marrow, salmon, broccoli, sweet potato fries, spinach- I don't normally eat seafood but I was so stuffed and satisfied when I left- I'll let you make the one night stand joke this time. EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Great Spot! Been to the one in AZ and this was just as good. Great service, great food! The bar area has a great look and the light entertainment was enjoyable. Will consider going back next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The hostess was the rudest EVER! For a fine dining restraint, they need to train the staff. She didn't greet us. The restaurant was not busy or full however she told us that we could pull two tables together in the bar!! Wtf? We had a party of 6. She didn't even look at us as she rudely pointed to the bar. My sister had to ask her to direct us which way. As we walked in to the dining room another waiter saw us looking confused and sat us at a table. She needs to be fired!!! 

However the food was excellent and the service was good. 

Only complaint was the skinny brunette hostess who has no business seating guest at a fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"Truly a study of excess starting with the \"tree house\" in the middle of the Crystals Mall.  The excellent food is also a study of excess especially if you are not a huge eater!  Starting with the Escargot, served in the shell swimming in butter and garlic with a wonderful assortment of breads on the side.  Best I have had in a long time.  The entree of Ahi Tuna Sashimi was huge (10 oz.) and perfectly cooked (virtually uncooked!) was a real treat.  The scallops were also more than generous, perfectly seared and served in a wonderful creamy sauce with toast points.  We decided to splurge and went for the $37 lobster mashed potatoes and were not disappointed, only bad part is this really would be too much for a table of four instead of 2 but we managed to eat all the lobster anyway.  Service was flawless.  As you might imagine the bill was part of the excess, cocktails, wine, shared app, entrees with side and a shared desert came to about $260 but it was fun!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent evening out with friends at mastro's.   This is my second time here and both times it's been above my expectations.  It's got a somewhat more casual feel than a lot of the fancier places, which I like.  One of the better steaks I've had in Vegas for sure."}
{"text":"I went here 2 months ago and was disappointed with my fish. Gave it another try but this time had a filet. I will have dreams about that filet. Cooked perfect and had awesome flavor. Service was 10 times better too. Glad I gave it another shot."}
{"text":"What is there to say about Mastro's Ocean Club that has not already been said? It's funny . . . we live in Scottsdale, home of the original Mastro's and Mastro's Ocean Club, and yet, this is where we decided to dine in Las Vegas. Having never been to Mastro's Ocean Club in Scottsdale, but knowing friends far and wide have been so delighted there, we thought on our vacation, we should give the sister restaurant a try! We are so glad we did!

The space itself is very unique in design. We were seated in the \"Tree House\". It is quite a spectacle from inside as well as outside as the wood towers from the lower level of the Crystals shopping center to the very top with a rounded platform area, that kind of resembles an open wooden spaceship, within which is the dining room seating. It is very light and airy. There is plenty of room between tables and despite some of other reviewers complaints that the music is loud, we had no problem with it, even on a Friday night.

Our waiter (I think his name is Robert) was one of the best servers we have ever had, in just about any restaurant in which we have dined. He was knowledgeable, friendly, didn't hover, and was not pushy at all. He gave us time to order, time in between courses, time to finish the humongous plates of food.  The rest of the waitstaff was also attentive. Having sat outside at the pool all day, my husband was parched, and I think he drank at least eight glasses of water . . . he never had to wait for the glass to be refilled! When I couldn't finish a course, the attendant asked if he could wrap the remaining up to go. I didn't have to flag anyone down.

The food was top notch, bar none!  We started with the ahi tuna tartare. It was a massive appetizer of tiny cubed ahi piled above avocado and what I believe were panko chips. Fresh, flavorful and enough for a table of four (not two) to share! Not knowing how large the portion was going to be, we also ordered an Ocean Club Salad to split - fabulous! And, huge! It had chopped egg, onion, shrimp, lobster, blue cheese . . . you could eat one as a meal. At that point, I issued a proclamation to my husband, aside from our main entrees, we could only order ONE side. Hubby ordered the bone-in rib eye . . . a hunka hunka burnin' love of meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly seared to medium rare. Bliss for my hubby who gets no red meat at home!  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass Oreganata . . . melted in my mouth . . . and, it too was a giant piece of fish! I couldn't even finish it. The twice baked potato was delish, even luke warm, as we couldn't even finish it during our meal, but instead had it as a midnight snack back in our hotel room!  

One other note . . . and this was pure genius. I couldn't finish my wine. If I put anything more into my stomach, I think I would have exploded! Our waiter said on the way out, take my drink to the hostess and she will give it to me to go. Apparently, the hostess can do this, but the waiter can't. Thinking I am going to get my wine in a plastic cup . . . the hostess actually poured it into another wine glass and told me to keep it! 

Without a doubt, this was the best meal we had in Vegas over this three-day holiday. And despite what some would say is a hefty price tag, I beg to differ. The quality of the service and food were spot on. We had dinner at two other similarly priced restaurants and left feeling robbed. Not so at Mastro's Ocean Club. 

I think I have finally convinced my husband to make the Scottsdale Mastro's Ocean Club on our regular rotation for fine dining . . . I hope it lives up to the Las Vegas outlet!"}
{"text":"We have dined at this restaurant 3 times it is one of my wife's favorites in Las Vegas. Yes it's expensive but if your going to have at least one special meal this is one of the best. The service is 5 star, the food is top notch, and the setting is spectacular. You are actually eating in a treehouse inside city center. Great spot for a first date, wedding proposal, or anniversary."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner.  Had a filet on bone and lobster mashed potatoes. If you are here in Scottsdale, make sure you go early!"}
{"text":"When you go to the Ocean Club, it feels like a special event...even if you're just there for a drink.  If you're interested in a world class dinner for business or with friends/family, Ocean Club has never disappointed.  The lounge is very cool with live music and table clothed high tops.  I'd recommend having one or two gin martini's but they've got whatever you're looking for.  It's my favorite."}
{"text":"Pricey!!!  However, great meal as usual. When visiting Scottsdale, we always go their once for dinner. It's our date night when we leave the kids with the parents.
King crab legs were the best that I've ever had. The butter cake was delicious."}
{"text":"Service: 
Seemed hectic(?) although there didn't seem to be much going on for a Wednesday evening. I didn't feel like I was at a $$$$ restaurant. The waiter took awhile to come over once seated and the pacing of the meal was very odd. The bone marrow took 20 minutes to come out which was fine, (we were warned of this) but the lobster bisque soup took another 20 minutes after that, and we sat around for 20 minutes with nothing to eat between soup and dinner. 

Location: 
Looks wonderful. We sat in the cool wooden treehouse thing. The problem is, there is no climate control. It was HOT. I sweated throughout the meal. Shame. I didn't really get a good feel of being \"in the air\" or a good view. I think it looks cooler from the outside.

Drinks:
The lemon drop was delicious and fun with the smoking dry ice. The tiki-time was fine although forgettable.

Food:
The bread basket was interesting. It wasn't warm? Some of the pieces were tough to eat and made a real crumb mess...

Bone marrow appetizer was good. Although I think we both preferred the side salad with capers and cheese to the actual bone marrow.

Lobster bisque was fine. There were some interesting complex flavors, but my partners portion had a shell in it. (not ok for fine dining...)

I had the recommended 12oz bone-in filet for dinner. It was seasoned well. I ordered medium-rare. Maybe 1-2 bites near the bone were medium rare. The rest was brown all the way through. The meat was incredibly tender and well seasoned but the temperature was all over the place. They do serve it on a 400 degree plate (why?) that made all of the side dishes on my plate scalding hot...

Partner had the halibut filet with panko cheese crust. The crust was slightly burnt. The fish was incredibly overcooked, dry and tasteless. The waiter noticed our dis-interest and had it removed from the bill...

The lobster mashed potatoes were fine, although certainly nothing fabulous. The sauteed asparagus was also adequate. 

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The best dessert I've ever had is the butter cake, with fruit, whipped cream and ice cream. I have always enjoyed dinner, sea bass is my favorite, what a treat it always is to go to Ocean Club!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations going into the evening, and they were completely met and the exceeded. Starting with the seafood tower, which blew my mind, the fest was on. We had what was described to us as a Mediterranean Sea Bass for our entree. It was ok, not a ton of flavor, but it was saved by the wonderful side dishes we had. 
For dessert we had the chocolate cake and the butter cake. The winner of the two was the butter cake! Amazing!!! 
Lastly we topped off the night with some 20yr Pappy Van Winkle. What a great night! Love this place."}
{"text":"Had fantastic meal last night. Service was excellent. Food was excellent. Absolutely nothing to complain about. Nothing!! Very high priced, but the quality was there. Note it can be noisy. If you are looking for very quiet conversation, this might not be a good choice."}
{"text":"Is Morton's, Ruth's Chris, Flemings, Ed been there is Mastro's! Phenomenal jumbo shrimp cocktail! Delicious chopped wedge with hickory smoked bacon! Tender juicy Filet!  Garlic infused mushrooms that are to die for! And then there is the desert of all desserts! You have not lived in till you have had Mastro's butter cake!!! I've been to master this many times but had never made room for dessert. Oh my gosh! This last time, we were so happy we did! There is always room for the butter cake from now on! Absolutely out of this world, and just difficult to explain... just order it! Also, the coffee was wonderful and I am a coffee snob! I recommended this place without hesitation. Oh, and did I mention the service is impeccable? You can't go wrong at Mastro's. It is pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmy! This restaurant is so delicious. The service can be a little slow on the weekend but it's understand with so many people dining out. I've had their bone in ribeye and sea scallops. They were juicy and delicious! I highly recommend this place. Yes it's pretty pricey but it's worth the money if the food is good"}
{"text":"Was there for a casual dinner, it was good but not great. The service at times was annoying, especially when they fill your water glass up every 10 seconds. The food was adequate but not spectacular. If you want a spectacular Mastros experience I would suggest going to the Mastro's in Beverly Hills, CA. It is above and beyond anything you'll experience in Las Vegas. I would go back to the Las Vegas location but only after some serious thought and consideration of some of the other steak houses in Vegas."}
{"text":"Terrific steak, the lobster mashed potatoes were great. The best part was the butter cake dessert. You must try it....amazing. I would give it five stars if it had better ambiance....it's in the middle of a mall."}
{"text":"Top shelf restaurant.  The BEST

Burt is  a regular at the Chicago Mastro's.  Burt loves it.  The Vegas version is an Ocean Club.  Everything here is top quality. Bone in Ribeye,  Bone in Filet,  brussel sprouts, Scalloped Potatoes.  Butter cake dessert.  The usual Mastro's fantastic food.  PLUS seafood. 

  Burt ordered the twin lobster tails.  Cooked to perfection!  Not an easy thing to do.  Lobster usually is a little tough or well done.  This came out perfectly and cooked very slowly on the hot plate but never got over cooked.  Excellent service as usual.  

Mastro's Ocean Club is located in the center of a mall.  That sounds horrible doesn't it?  But its not.  First off its a high end mall.  Burt requested to sit  in the Tree House, which is a modern type open style room that hangs out over the mall.  It was very comfortable.  A live band was playing in the lounge so being in the Birdhouse was a nice distance to hear the music and feel the energy but still be able to conversate(sic) with the people at your table.  

Bottom Line-  Burt Loves This Place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Mastros in the past, but this was our first time to the Oceans Club. We had the most amazing server. Eric Kelly, really helped create an amazing meal for my husband and me. He is very professional, knowledgable, friendly, and knows good food! I told him that I loved seafood and he helped us pick out the  perfect oysters, sashimi appetizer, and perfect preparation for my tuna. My husband, who is more of a meat lover even liked the sashimi! The food at the Oceans Club is exquisite, but when that is complimented with great service, it becomes such a more memorable experience. Thanks for the great experience Eric! We plan on going back the next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I discovered this place when we first moved to Scottsdale and fell in love with it! The steaks are cooked perfect, The fish is delicious, and the desserts like strawberries with whipped cream  best eatin on the piano bar is superb! Its a great atmosphere to meet people and have cocktails. If you are really feeling wicked you must try the chocolate sin cake when you feel like indulging in a moment of ectasy."}
{"text":"I don't want to repeat what everyone else has said. It really is a fantastic meal. Especially if you're out celebrating something special or romantic. The artistic treehouse canopy is lovely to sit under. The service is phenomenal and thoughtful (when I said I was already getting full after my appetizer, the waiter offered to make my scallops entree an appetizer portion). The gorgonzola mac n cheese is out of this world. The brussel sprouts are excellent. The scallops amazing. The oysters rockefeller were the best I've ever tasted. The Chilean Sea bass also was the best I've ever tasted (my bf had that... I tasted it). Then the warm butter cake... Cuh-ray-zee!!! So unbelievably good. My eyes went all googly and I nearly floated away. And the portions are generous so unless you're like us and were just curious to try many different things, don't order too much. It will be enough."}
{"text":"Outstanding! We had planned to eat at Sage at Aria, but ran too late so  Mastros was a happy last minute accident. Even though our waitress was in training, the service was great, the food and ambience was excellent. Had lamb chops and twin lobster tails, brussel sprouts & scalloped potatoes....all cooked and seasoned perfectly. The piano bar singers were very good and not C+  cheesy like most Vegas entertainment. Dinner was very expensive, but excellent."}
{"text":"The food, the service and the atmosphere were incredible. I've been coming to Mastro's since they opened and have never been disappointed. Their drinks are beyond incredible, and although they are expensive they come out in a shaker so you get a drink and a half or two drinks out of each order. 

Everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic, starting with the breadbasket that is brought out. Make sure you leave room for dessert because their butter cake is the most amazing dessert I've ever had!

I wish I can give them more than five stars!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and finally had a chance to stop by, and am so glad we did. 

We had reservations for our wedding anniversary and was promptly seated. Outstanding drink and meal menu. We ordered the oysters  and two cocktails (jalapeño martini for me) with a perfect amount of kick to it. I ordered the Hawaiian big eye tuna served sashimi style. I would definitely recommend it. They gave us a complimentary anniversary desert which included their whipped cream made from scratch which threw me off guard with the amount of homemade flavor. 

The staff was real nice and professional. I would highly recommend this place for special occasions or if you're just craving a great meal. With the exception of parking, we truly enjoyed our time. I will definitely be retuning."}
{"text":"Should be renamed, Unnecessarily Overpriced Ocean Club.   It is exactly like any other upscale Seafood place with about a 30% markup on almost every item.   Some even more.

Things I liked:
1. The bread was great.
2. Attentive service. 
3.  Nice decor.
4. Good Calamari. 
5. Good Lobster Bisque. 
6. Great Petite Filet.
7. Good mashed potatoes.
8. Great wine selection. Malbec's!
9. The clientele didn't seem as douchy as other reviews led me to believe.  I didn't see one gal that looked like an ex stripper.   Maybe they come in later.

Things I didn't like.
1.  Insanely overpriced.
2.  Waiter suggests unnecessary things.  Ours recommended too many side dishes and adding extra shrimp to our appetizer.  I can only think he would do this to pad the bill for a bigger tip.  Take whatever he suggests and divide it by two.  You will probably still have sides for leftovers.  
3. The seafood is nothing special:  Sashimi Ahi Tuna was as chewy and tough.  The vanilla battered Sole is merely a twenty something dollar Fish Fry.  And a not very good one at that.   The other seafood items ordered were very forgettable. 
4.  As mentioned above the steak was good, but some others are really overpriced.  If you want to charge $40-$60 for a steak it better be dry aged or come from a grass fed or organically fed cow.  Give me some reason to spend that much! There is no mention of that anywhere on the menu and the waiters make no mention of it.  This is why I can safely assume they are wet aged instead, as most steak houses are. 
5. The place is loud.  We got there before it became busy so we noticed as the sound level increased. 
6.  The menu is almost exactly the same as the Scottsdale Steakhouse, but the Seafood is placed above the meat portion of the menu.   
In the end the food, despite its price, is not very inventive.  The seafood tower seems interesting until you see it is nothing more than an ice bowl filled with the crustaceans of your choice and some dry ice to attract attention.  Maybe that is what this place is all about, attracting attention.  If so, this would explain the reasoning behind a $7,000 bottle of wine.  
I won't be back, and given the steakhouse has the pretty much the same menu I won't be trying that place either.  I will take my steak needs to Michael Mina's Bourbon Steak.  Or maybe save a few bucks and \"Slum It\" at Ruth's Chris or Flemings."}
{"text":"Love coming here when we come to Vegas. Restaurant is located in the Crystal 's center, which is close to surrounding hotels. The staff is friendly and very polite. Our waiter Paul was awesome!! Food portions are a good size. The steak, salad and sides were cooked to perfection. The food was delicious. The most amazing dessert ever is the butter cake."}
{"text":"Dinner with the wife. We sat in the lounge for the music and ASU game ( Yes They WON ) Our waiter was Andy,he did a pretty good job. Always checking with us and making sure we were happy. We started with the Tuna Ahi for an App. and it was very good.  I order the Bone in Filet and ordered it med Rare with solid pink through-out. About 1/3 of the way into it I discovered it was not Med Rare. The lights in the lounge are very low. It tasted good But would have been better I am sure if it was cook correctly. It had great taste but it didn't have that \"melt in your mouth\" feeling like I have had at Eddie V's or Flemmings."}
{"text":"Just finished a perfect dinner here! Everyone was impressed with their meals. I had the grouper and it was wonderful! We had 2 people get the rib eye and 3 get the filet. Our sides were the lobster mashed potatoes and the Mac n cheese. We also had calamari which was the best any of us had ever eaten. Only thing I regret was not saving room for the desserts I saw at other tables. Two sides were more than enough for our group of 6! I did not find the total bill to be too much! Any nice place I expect to be around $100 per person. Overall a perfect dinner"}
{"text":"My friend was celebrating his BD with his family. My husband and I were excited to have been invited and to visit Maestro. The service was good but the food no big deal. My salad looked like a $4. It consisted of chopped iceberg n a bit of radicchio w/ a bit of pickled peppers. The salmon was over cooked n dry. I returned it n they brought me the scallops but even that I was not able to eat. It was smothered in cream and it was overly salted. I did not sent it back but I did not eat it either. When dessert came, I took one bite and put my fork down. It was loaded n masked with lots of sugar not a good quality dessert. I didn't want to seem ungracious so I did not say anything to the people I was with. But I realized that Maestro is over rated with bad expensive food. I  commented to my husband that I would never go back there.  If I'm going to spend money for an experience, I would like to be able to at least enjoy the food. I know many restaurant that don't have the hype yet the food is worth so much more than what they charge bc is good food."}
{"text":"incredible !!!
great setting, service and food preparation.
loved the service , brandon was so great,
and the fish was terrific.
and we got the butter cake and it was spectacular.
i had the bronzino and my husband the swordfish 
both terrific"}
{"text":"Let me start from the beginning here. I was searching for a good date spot for me and my gf. I have dined at most of the finer restaurants in Vegas. But I wanted to try something new and by far, this was the best reviewed spot. Only thing that turned me off was that it was in the middle of a mall. NOT AN ISSUE. I requested the 'Tree House' and that is where we were sat. Once in there I completely forgot I was in a mall...it was romantic and beautiful. Our server greeted us and asked if we've ever diner here before....we both responded \"NO\". We were then treated to a 5 minute explanation of their entire menu. Based on other reviews...we started with the shrimp cocktail and I suggest you do the same. Very unique and brilliant presentation. My gf had the Fillet of Arctic Char \"Oreganata\"..we both LOVED it. I had the Bone In Rib-Eye. Cooked perfectly. Delicious. For sides we chose the mac-n-cheese(not bad, but kinda bland to what I've had at comparable restaurants) and the brussel sprouts...fantastic. We had no room for dessert. Cocktails were good....coming from a guy in that business. As we left, EVERYONE thanked us for coming...from busser to manager. That was impressive. I even woke up the next morning to a voicemail from them thanking me for me business and hoping that me and my 'beautiful' gf had a great time; and that they hope to see us again. ONLY complaint..and this is being picky: when our bread was dropped off(with multiple choices), it was just thrown down with no explanation as to what was what. But this is a must go!"}
{"text":"Love everything about this restaurant.   The food is amazing and the butter cake is to die for."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I dined in the grand piano lounge a few nights ago. Service was impeccable, our server Raquel was not only knowledgeable, but put up with all of my questions and requests. We absolutely loved the music  and since we make a trip to Vegas a few times a year, you can be sure we will be back. (Hopefully at the same high table near the bar with that sweetheart Raquel."}
{"text":"It's not that we had a bad experience at Mastro's. But for what we paid I was expecting a bit more. The bread basket was good, but not dazzling. The tomato and mozzarella salad we shared wasn't memorable. In fact, for burratta mozzarella it wasn't good at all. I thoroughly enjoyed my bone-in filet which made up for the salad. The side of mashed potatoes was decent but not outstanding, same goes for the side of peas we shared. Mostly we went because the location was conveniently close to the Aria, where we stayed, and because after seeing the tree house on a previous visit to Vegas I desperately wanted to eat there. Being in the tree house wasn't the best experience. It's loud, since you are in the middle of the Crystal's mall. All in all, it was decent but overpriced in my opinion. I probably won't be returning to this Mastro's location."}
{"text":"This steakhouse is heaven on earth. The ribeye and filet are excellent, even the sides were amazing asparagus - yum, lobster mashed potatoes were so worth the extra lbs. Our server was charming and helpful in every way. Definitely worth the splurge. Love you Mastro's!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with great service.  We started out with cocktails that were delicious.  Our group ordered a good variety of surf and turf and we were all able to sample a lot of great seafood.  I ordered sea bass, baked instead of seared for a change, but it was excellent and cooked to perfection.

Of course, the butter cake, signature dessert was amazing!"}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with this place. I had only been to Mastro's in Newport Coast, CA. When I found Mastro's in Scottsdale, I knew I had to spend my birthday here. 
The ambiance is incredible. The bar is beautiful. And the food was perfectly made. 
My favorite part of the night was my INCREDIBLE key lime martini and my Lobster Mashed potatoes.
We had a great server who was super attentive and made my birthday dinner feel extremely special. They gave me a complimentary chocolate cake...to die for. A major hand clap for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Really delicious! Pricey, but that's Mastro's & the area. If you have the time, appetite and $, order the seafood tower! I came with a group of 6, highly recommend reservations (we had, but the wait was extremely long for those who didn't). The wine selection was great, service was fun and professional. We had a fantastic experience, the sides are huge and we ordered 3 to share. If you don't like noisy places, this isn't for you. Easy from start to finish with the valet.  Save room for the butter cake!"}
{"text":"Beast seafood in Scottsdale that I know of, dinner only but worth the wait.  The tenderloin with demi is awesome"}
{"text":"I was here on a business dinner.

Didn't have any drinks so I can't comment on that.

The hostess was this beautiful brunette, I'd say around 21.

Got seated without any issues and our server was a guy in his 30's.
He was funny, quick and sarcastic. Can't recall his name but he had some facial hair and we tipped him well.

I went with a rib-eye and the wasabi mashed potatoes. Excellent."}
{"text":"Got to freeload a meal at Mastro's last week. Been to all the Mastro's restaurants except the thousand oaks location so i'm very familiar with their food. 

a little surprised by the bar area - kinda small felt a little claustrophobic . Asked for a michelob ultra - sorry , we ran out ...on a tuesday ?!?!? 

the restaurant is cool looking but i don't need our waiter to babble on about who designed it, how much was spent, blah blah blah 

Let's focus on the food. 

Started with the seafood tower - solid . Of course, the pretzel bread - still my fav pretzel bread though CUT gives Mastro's a run for the $$$. 

I went for the meat - Bone in rib eye, some creamed spinach and asparagus. Of course, my fav, the blue cheese/oil oil and garlic sauce for the steak ( pic ) ...decent but not to the level of the mastro's in B. Hills and Costa Mesa . The rib eye was also average - the talk about the plate being 400 degrees when it's brought to you - i think they needed to add the 400 degrees to the broiler - i ordered medium but it was rare. more bothersome, it didn't have that nice outer sear bordering on crunch - it was too soft ! flavor was decent. 

Some nice pinot noir wines - even though the host gave me the wine list to order, i showed restraint - a Laetitia from Paso Robles and a forgotten Oregon - both under $90 each"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was their level of service. The staff was amazing and I feel like my party was a lot of work for them and they remained pleasant, helpful, and toggled between utmost professionalism and fun and silly based on what we needed. 

The food itself was good overall. I wasn't blown away. We had crab legs for an appetizer, I'm not a connoisseur here but they were good. The main dishes were the highlight for me, we had filets and a crusted sea bass. The Brussels sprouts were pretty plain and blah, Gorgonzola mac and cheese was decent. Everyone at the table loved the butter cake, I'm not really a sweets person but it was good."}
{"text":"To me just the architecture of the place alone is magnificent. First time I visited the City Center I was blown away by this very spectacular  structure. When I found out there is a restaurant inside I knew I have to try it.

On one of my visits to Sin City I was lucky enough to experience the remarkable dinning from above. 
We shared the Chopped salad. Yeah, you are thinking \"out of the colorful selection, really?\" But it was marvelous. So flavorful and fresh. 

And then Rack of lamb medium rare followed. Ahhhh,,,,, it came on super hot plate the whole rack in one piece. We cut through the meat which was on rare side and finish cooking it on the hot plate. The result  flavor of the dish was beyond extraordinary. Best rack of lamb ever.

Atmosphere great, music decent, waiters nice and well knowledge  of menu and wine."}
{"text":"Excellent place to entertain clients.  This was not my first time at Mastro's and they never disappoint.  The Wagu beef was the best I've ever had.  EVERYTHING wasa absolutely delicious, and the staff is as professional as they come.  Unfortunately for me, after this visit, I fell ill.  I have no reason to believe it was because of Mastro's, but when they called to follow up on my dining experience, I told them, in the event others had also had issues.  They assured me they had not been aware of issues, but would talk to their chef, just in case.  They followed up with two more phone calls that rang true of genuine concern.  I live in the Chicagoland area and had no idea they had a restaurant in Chicago as well - if not for their phone calls, I may not know for a long time.  Class act, all the way around."}
{"text":"Fancy.  The 18 oz. steak and lobster mashed potatoes were very good.  The steak was juicy, and lobster pieces were with every bite.  Yes, this place is pricey and it was busy.  Split the dishes if you can.  Also, the bread served before the dishes were very very soft, and warm.  I think reservations are a must here, but you can also sit at the bar area if seats are available."}
{"text":"Love maestros. When family was here we had two adult only dinners during the week and of all the places in town we chose maestros. Great food, service and atmosphere and they stay open late which we like. Shellfish app is always a must. From there you can't go wrong with lobster tails or steak or surf n turf for entree. But for dessert the butter cake is a must yummm!"}
{"text":"The service is outstanding and the seafood is excellent (I've had the sea bass, scallops, salmon, ahi and filet) but if you were eating the same food anywhere else I don't think it would stand out relative to the exhorbitant prices. I've eaten here several times, all on business trips (read: expense account) and overall it's a good place to entertain clients.  I don't mind paying for a phenomenal dining experience, but I wouldn't spend my own money here.  

Also, considering the food they're serving and the prices, the wine list is suprisingly uninspired."}
{"text":"When my husband and I visited Vegas this weekend, we both had a craving for delicious seafood.  Unfortunately for us, many of the restaurants that served seafood were primarily steakhouses.  We read a few yelp reviews for Mastro's among others and eventually made a reservation here for dinner that same night.

When we arrived, we were seated inside the \"tree house\" that's suspended in the center of the shops.  We ordered a bottle of Shiraz, the halibut and the sea bass encrusted with their special seasoning, and macaroni and cheese.  Our water was never more than half empty at any given time throughout our entire meal.  

The food and wine turned out to be amazing!  Our waiter (I wish I remembered his name) was kind enough to ask if we wanted the rest, including the wine, boxed up since I had been feeling sick to finish it.  

A few tips if you visit, the sides are quite large, probably enough to split with up to 4 people.  Trust your waiter/waitress.  Ours suggested the preparation we had on our fish and we were not disappointed.  And the price is a bit high but well worth it in the end.  I would definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"I just experienced a wonderful meal at this establishment. I would say there was a mid-century modern flair to the establishment, with an extremely classy twist. Our server was a gentleman by the name of Eric Baily, and I use the term gentleman loosely...kidding of course, as this man had a great sense of humor, and would truly appreciate a joke as such. He was amazingly attentive.  Our table was also assisted by many other staff members throughout the meal, who were also very helpful and attentive. Everyone was definitely friendly, and seemed excited about the restaurant and what they had to offer. We also spoke with a bar manager for a bit, Luciana, I may have spelt that wrong :(. She had a radiant personality.  They offer a great cocktail and wine list. We tried a key lime martini...yum, and they had Duckhorn Decoy by the glass, for a respectable price...so I had to try it. The bar is beautiful, several stories in height, layered with a beautiful collage of bottles. There was a great open air feel to the restaurant, yet it still maintained a  wonderful level of intimacy. 

Then of course comes the food, solid, simple, and of high quality. Judging from my one experience...that seems to be what they are going for. We had a chilled lobster cocktail and oysters on the half shell for starters. Seriously...amazing oysters...I am in the middle of the desert....eating amazing oysters. The lobster was also great. For our mains we had a steak that came out on a 400 degree plate, hot as can be....I know because I touched it, even after I was warned not to ;P Perfect med rare...perfect med rare for sure. My lady had a crab cake dish... a little ballsy to order such a thing coming from living outside of Maryland for some time. Yet...it was much success...top notch fresh crab meat. I guess you gotta thank modern times and next day air, cause everything we tried was super fresh and very tasty. Again, dishes were very simplistic...but with fresh flavors such as that, you'd only be doing an injustice by masking it with complex levels of flavors."}
{"text":"I am glad I tried this great restaurant out.  The restaurant is located in the Aria City center in a mall called the Crystals.  It is located on the second floor that looks like a wooden Aladdin lamp.  

The ambiance was great.  It was comfortable, cozy, and had live music.  The food was pretty awesome.  I ordered the cowboy ribeye cut bone in steak.  It's the second largest steak on the menu.  It is probably by far the best cut of steak I've had.  It was tender, soft, and juicy.  The potatoes au gratin was alright.  Next time I am going to try the lobster mashed potatoes.  The bread they serve is pretty impressive.  You actually get a bread basket full of different assortment of bread.  There is pretzel bread, wheat, white, bread sticks, and others that I can't recall right now.  Tasted like it was freshly baked that day.

The service is the reason why I gave this place 5 stars instead of 4.  Our server was outstanding.  He was pretty knowledgeable about the food.  Helped me make up my mind on what I want right away.  Didn't give me too much info where it would confuse me (it doesn't take much to confuse me).  He checked up on us every now and then to see how we were doing on our meal.  He asked if we wanted to order dessert.  We declined because we were stuffed like a turkey at a thanksgiving dinner.  So we politely asked for the bill.  So our server brought us back a raspberry sorbet with our bill.  It was on the house and and he said he couldn't let us go without having dessert to complete our wonderful meal.  How cool was that!? I am not a sorbet fan, but I still take a few bites cause I'm a fatass.

I recommend to go and enjoy the food, but I will return because of the service."}
{"text":"Outstanding in every way!  The pretzel bread is out of this world.  I don't think better bread can be had.  It is beyond amazing.

The food, service, wine and ambiance are all fantastic.  This is the sort of place that defines Scottsdale and helps me understand how bad dining is in the East San Francisco Bay."}
{"text":"I will keep this short and simple. 
Service - awesome. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is so nice and attentive! 
Dining area- we requested to be seated in the wooden weavy basket area. Love the layout. This is a nice place if you wanted to do a business dinner! (We were just a party of two though)
Appetizer- Dungeness crab cocktail. Okay. I am spoiled by Seattle's seafood so I have high expectations. Yes. The crab is good. Cold and refreshing. However for $25 dollars I rather have tried something else as I can get much more up north. However it was good. 
Steak- bone in filet was their signature so that's the one we chose. I think they cooked it exactly the way we wanted. Medium rare. It was tender and it was good, but not melt in your mouth fantastic. It was overshadowed by (dun dun dun) the fish!!! 
Seafood- Chilean sea bass. I got it the \"arreganato\" way. I probably butchered the word too. Holy crap this was amazing. It melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more. 
Sides: thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi. Omg this is soooo good. The truffle oil just perfected it. Best gnocchi ever!!
Lobster mashed potatoes was a huge portion (had to take it to go!) I am not really a mashed potato or lobster fan but my bf is and he really liked it so definitely try one of these sides. 
Didnt have room for dessert but we really wanted to try the butter cake. Lame. Next time! 
Overall a good experience but expect to cough up some serious $$$. Try the fish!!!"}
{"text":"I love Mastro's the food here is FANTASTIC and the the atmosphere is very nice :) I love the vegetables here they are GREAT!!! The service is also very good and the prices may be up there...however its well worth the money :) WONDERFUL place to go for dinner :)"}
{"text":"i went to ocean club restaurant area.  I don't like to valet my car, only because I don't like other people in my car.  I tried to park but was harassed by the valet saying I could not park even though they had a ton of parking open.  Huge disadvantage!  I can always park close to Dominick's steak house in the garage close to restaurant.  They should let customers park regardless!  I have no complaints about food from my visits years ago, but the parking issue is irritating so I haven't been for many years."}
{"text":"This past weekend was my second time at Mastro's and this time I was in charge of planning for 16 hungry guys in a bachelor party.  The original number we 12, and I called 3 days before and had no problems getting a table.  By Saturday night, the number had ballooned to 16.  I was nervous about calling to change the reservation, but Mastro's called first and offered a private room which made it even easier to up the number to 16.  Many thanks to the Hostesses at Mastro's for being so easy to work with.  The service is here is friendly and confident, they know what they are doing.

The food continues to carry that confident theme.  Big, bold, and flavorful, the steaks here are serious...no sides to cover them up.  They are served to you \"naked\" with nothing else on the plate.  Sides can be ordered for the table and the sides pretty much all delicious.  Back to the steaks...Charred and flavorful on the outside, juicy and savory on the inside.  My mouth waters just thinking about it."}
{"text":"The steak here was really good. Cooked perfectly to my liking. I would definitely come back for some steak. 

The only reason I took 1 star off is because the sides were ok. We ordered the mushrooms, fries and green beans. Again, ok.

If you're in Vegas and looking for some good steak, Mastro's."}
{"text":"Perfect food, perfect service, a pretty and relaxing location, you can't ask for more.    We had the ribeye, lobster mashed potatoes, wedge salad and Caesar salad.  The food was delicious and portions were large.  Will be back as soon as possible.  Thank you for a very enjoyable evening out."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful and delicious!
Made reservations for this place back in January based on the Yelp reviews. So glad I did! Well worth every dollar!
Husband and I are celebrating our 10 year anniversary... (one notch down, 1,000 to go)
Our waiter, George was on point!
He started us off with a lemon drop martini.... yeah it was the bomb!
Appetizers (crab cakes) were amazing, they give you so much food, no way you leave without a take home bag or two.
Husband ordered the swordfish, I chose the 22oz. ribeye (medium). When the plate arrived it was so hot the steak was still sizzling! Cooked to perfection. Lawd have mercy! Lobster mashed potatoes were so smooth and well seasoned. Creamed spinach was definitely fresh, not frozen. Also had to try Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi. Very good I must say!

The lemonade was perfect and they made sure to place it with a refill each time.
To end our experience, we received a large complimentary slice of double chocolate cake to share!
I honestly don't have anything negative to say about this restaurant. 
We will definitely visit again while in Vegas. 
*I suggest casual attire*
*Take pictures, you don't want to forget this restaurant*"}
{"text":"this place was suggested by the Aria concierge and it was horrible.
food was cold and service was bad.
when your waiter helps you to your side dish and a veggie falls on the table, it should not be picked up by your waiter and put on your plate.
just bad, real bad"}
{"text":"Great attention and great food. I had the bone in filet, oysters, scalloped potatoes and truffle fries. The steak was tender and extraordinary, highly recommended. The oysters were fresh and the scalloped mashed potatoes were nice and buttery. I can't find a single negative at this fine dining establishment. 

I was too full to eat the infamous butter cake there so I took it home. This is an absolute must. I could have not chosen a better steakhouse."}
{"text":"The experience was excellent. Wide variety of food on the menu...Lemon Sole was outstanding, started with escargot and then had the house salad...,service was over the top good!"}
{"text":"We had a group that went to dinner Saturday night...they had replaced the band - 2 men piano and guitar with a night club act that didn't fit Ocean Club at ALL. Marlie was with Zowie Bowie from Vegas - it's not conducive to dinner music...piano playing oldies is...sorry but we will eat at City Hall until it changes"}
{"text":"Service is impeccable. The menu is diverse with your choice of either different cuts of meat or numerous fish options. The seafood tower is an eye-Catcher. I would recommend that to start and then head in the direction of steak. Wine list is, of course, expansive and diverse. An excellent experience all in itself."}
{"text":"Still one of our favorite places to eat...not as good as the Newport Beach location but better than most everything in Vegas! Love the attitudes of the staff and food is always excellent!"}
{"text":"I was in town staying at the Westin Kierland on a work-related trip. Here are my notes from dinner on a Wednesday night.

1. The restaurant is conveniently located a short walk (across the street) from the hotel in an upscale shopping mall with a number of restaurants including chain establishments such as this one, PF Changs, Mortons, and The Cheesecake factory along with places I've never heard of before (Bar NoRTH, Ra Sushi Restaurant, The Greene House...possibly also chains?)
2. The music inside was way too loud and made it difficult to converse with my dinner companions and hard to hear our waiter. The live band was certainly lively and a nice touch but a few notches quieter would've been preferable.
3. Our waiter, while amiable and knowledgeable about the menu, was a little too wordy. His spiel wasn't super helpful as he took a long time to summarize some of the menu offerings. The order of his descriptions was kind of hapazard and we hadn't had the chance to look at our menus. Plus, the loudness made it hard to understand him.
4. Portions. In a word, HUGE. I ordered the 12oz sashimi style ahi tuna. It was monstrous. I ate a little more than half of it and had to pawn the rest off on my colleagues with heartier appetites.
5. Food. Starter was the chef's salad... My tuna was cooked nicely but was presented on a plate of sauce that was extremely salty. I had a bite of my colleague's braised salmon. My bite was rich, creamy-tasting, and melt-in-your-mouth moist. Delicious. But he didn't end up finishing his plate and I could understand why. A giant 12oz portion of such a rich piece of fish inevitably leads to diminishing returns...
6. Drink. My waiter recommended the Ginger Breeze cocktail for me to go with the ginger that came with my sashimi-style tuna. Not a fan. Too sweet and I couldn't taste the ginger but it did come in the shaker it was made in and was at least two martini-glasses full of drink (like everything else here, they don't skim on the portions).
7. Dessert was the signature Maestro butter cake. Pretty much as advertised, rich, buttery yellow cake with ice cream and whipped cream on the side. I had no real beef with the dessert. I liked that the whipped cream was placed in a separate dish and the ice cream was a tasty (though hard to pinpoint) flavor. The cake itself was good but not great. It smelled and tasted strongly of butter sugary goodness and was very moist and rich.
8. Service. Throughout the night, service was great. Drinks were always promptly and seamlessly refilled. Bread basket came right away and we even got a refill of that.

tl;dr this place is swanky and upscale, specializing in seafood and steaks. The ambiance is loud but service is great. Overall, my experience was fine but the food missed the mark for me as everything was over the top."}
{"text":"What can I say about Mastro. Easily the best dinner I had on my last Vegas trip, and I know that's not a statement that can be thrown out easily given the steep competition in the area.

We made a reservation for two and was seated in the 'treehouse' area, which was great for people-watching, as many tourists come filtering through the mall, stopping to gawk and try and make sense of this structure that we're dining in. We had the ahi tuna and bone marrow appetizers and both were extremely delicious, the ahi tuna notable for its thick and generous cuts. The fish entrees we had (Arctic Cod and Bronzino) were made to perfection, but left us so stuffed that we had no room to try dessert, unfortunately. Special kudos to their complimentary bread bowl which is undoubtedly the most diverse, delicious, and high-quality 'free bread' I have had in a long time at any restaurant in this price range.

The service was attentive. The drinks were divine. For the fruity girly drinkers like me who still want a kick in their drink, try Tiki Time, which was just FANTASTIC.

Next time I fly back to LV, I'm getting into an Uber and going directly to Mastro's."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Anything Mastros will not disappoint.  We had Andy as a waiter and the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Mastros on jan 16 2015. Around 7pm. 
We were celebrating   My husband gave me a small crystal Druzy pendant which I Know I left there. I called when I got to my room and they said it was to busy to check and they would afterwards and get back to me. 
If they would have checked they would have found it. They did not. 
If anyone reading this found my present, please leave a comment. 
This place is not a friendly warm place. Food is good but not That good to take the place of being more considerate. We spent a lot of money and tipped well. Could have been a rave review if they went that extra mile. 
Too bad"}
{"text":"I admit I had my reservations dining in the middle of a mall, albeit a nice one, dining in the treehouse room felt intimate and classy.  In the grand scheme of steakhouses, I'd rate the food a solid 4, perhaps a 5, but the attention to detail by the staff, fantastic cocktails, wonderful ambiance, and late hours helped Mastro's earn a 5th star in its belt.

I was a bit peeved that we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our table at the bar, but the generous cocktail pours helped soothe the senses.  Plus, we were late to our reservation by an hour and a half so I had to throw them a bone (haha!).  We arrived around 10:30pm and were surprised to find a happening bar scene and a 75% full dining room.  We left past 1am, but the staff was gracious and didn't try to rush us out even when we were the second to last table in the restaurant.

The food was delicious.  We may have over ordered on the appetizers, but we hadn't eaten in 12 hours so we figured we would indulge a bit.  Very fresh oysters with all the fixings with lemon halves that were wrapped in cheesecloth and speared onto a fork.  Great detail.  Smoked salmon plate was also good.  The fried calamari was ok - good, but certainly have had better.  My bone-in rib-eye was great.  Cooked a little past medium rare, but still tasted wonderful - a nice char on the outside, lightly salted crust.  The side dishes were also good, in particular the mac and cheese, but get it while it's still warm.  At the end of our meal, our coffee order came out a bit lukewarm, but it was close to closing time so I gave them a pass.  In honor of the groom, the staff also brought out a dessert with the words \"Don't do it!\" written in chocolate on the borders of the plate.  Again, great attention to detail.

I really think this is where Mastro's shines.  The details.  We were asked whether we wanted a black napkin versus a white one to minimize lint getting onto dark pants when we sat down.  I just received a phone call today asking whether we enjoyed our experience and to visit again.  I might have had a better steak elsewhere (not by much), but it's a real pleasure to dine somewhere that focuses on the little details that elevate a dining experience into a fine dining experience.  Bravo Mastro's - I will be back."}
{"text":"This is where the people go when they want to LOOK like they know good food & to mingle with hotties, cougars & your run of the mill Scottsdale ghoul. You know the social ghoul - the ones that our giving our city a bad name.

Let's see....where to start. HUGE portions. These people are still in the frame of mind that more means great, screw quality. Fat people and dumb people will embrace the super sized meals.

Ambiance? My ass. Our server Billy didn't take our order until AFTER we'd finished our appetizer, leaving us 20 minutes to stare at the wall. The bussers hovering nearby forgot to remove every dish we finished. 

We were SO disappointed. This place was a hangout, not a serious dining experience.  If you KNOW food, don't go here."}
{"text":"Just okay... We came for a nice romantic seafood dinner and were disappointed. The place is good for people watching for sure, very fun, upbeat atmosphere, but not so much for a high quality meal. The tables are too close together, music too loud (even though we were far from it).  I had a simple, bland swordfish and I believe my guy had Chilean sea bass which wasn't great. We often go out for seafood and will probably stick to our other favorites - Wildfish and Ocean Prime."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday here. Delicious food all night long. Ordered the Sauteed Sea Scallops as an appetizer, Bone-In Ribeye, Lobster Mashed Potatoes (a MUST!), Creamed corn (delicious and not too sweet), and Sauteed Asparagus.

As soon as we arrived, our waiter approached us and greeted us. He went over the menu and brought us complimentary bread and drinks. Checked on us several times and had some great recommendations. The service size was huge. I had the Cajun Alaskan Halibut - Yum! So fantastic! Others had steaks, too big but way too delicious. We were celebrating a birthday -- and we got huge complimentary dessert -- oh and the dessert came with like even bigger portion of whipped cream! lol We were too full for the dessert but appreciated the gesture.

Consistently delicious food every time we come. 5 stars for service, food, everything. Try to get a table inside the treehouse. Few of the items we ordered:

Petite filet: absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. 
Heirloom tomato and burrata cheese: very good but pricey at $20.
Sea salt and vinegar fries: addicting!
Alaskan halibut: hubby says was very good.
Creamed corn side: delish.
Signature butter cake: so yummy!
Sugar snap peas side: cooked perfect...super crunchy.
Table bread and butter: even that was awesome!

Would highly recommend and def be back, Mastros!"}
{"text":"My first Mastro's experience took place inside the treehouse of the steakhouse chain's Las Vegas restaurant. I had never expected to take the plunge at Mastro's in Vegas, as I have been eyeballing its SoCal locations for years but never had set foot inside.

The verdict? In the overall spectrum of Las Vegas steakhouses, Mastro's was superior to Craftsteak but a significant step down from CUT. 

The high point of the meal arrived early in the form of the seafood tower, which was over-the-top but fantastic. In short, the seafood tower here crushes the one at Oceanaire. It's the best reason to have dinner here.

The low point of the meal was my filet. In fact, in an unexpected turn of events, I left feeling as though I should have ordered the salmon instead. Like everyone else at my table did. As for wine, order the duck horn merlot. 

Surprisingly, another underwhelming aspect of the meal were the sides. Mastro's take on mac and cheese was a bust compared to CUT. The lobster mashed potatoes were a let down too, especially given the hype and eye-popping price tag. As a salad, I had wanted to order the caprese, which generally is a favorite of mine. Our server talked me into the heirloom burrata instead, which I regretted doing after tasting it.

For dessert, the chocolate cake sounded like the best choice after skimming the menu, but turned out to be dry. The better option was effectively donuts with ice cream. Neither, however, were good enough to recommend with much enthusiasm."}
{"text":"Wow...I have been here multiple times and Ocean Club never disappoints!!!!!!  The ambiance is so nice...and I love the live music they often play there.  Wonderful seafood and wonderful drinks....ah....I just love Ocean Club!!"}
{"text":"Brought my parents here to celebrate both of their 80th birthdays this year. Made reservations online indicating our celebration and when we arrived reception greeted my folks with a cheery \"happy birthday!\" 

We ordered a bottle of Cabernet and a bottle of pelligrino to go along with our warm bread basket. Started with shared Caesar salad and ocean club salad which the kitchen split for us, that's always a nice gesture when a restaurant does this. I enjoyed the ocean club salad, fresh, with shrimp, chopped tomato, egg, and bacon. Salads were dressed just right. We ordered steaks all around except for my mom who ordered the Chilean sea bass along with fresh asparagus, sautéed mushrooms and scalloped potatoes. Entrees were cooked perfectly and delicious, I had a piece of mom's sea bass and it was to die for! Sides were good with the exception of the scalloped potatoes which were way too salty (maybe I shouldn't have said yes to add Gruyere cheese). The finale was Mastro's warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream with piping around the plate \"happy 80th birthday\" and coffees. Wow, cake was sumptuous and so very good!

Really a wonderful, leisurely evening bonding and reminiscing. Glad we chose Mastro's to celebrate a special event! A special thanks to our server, Tim who was so friendly and patient with us. He even walked with dad to show him where the men's room was. He's the best!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great vibes. Live music.  Huge selection of the best food.  We loved it.  Made a Thursday feel like a Friday."}
{"text":"This place was so freaking amazing!  We sat in the tree house last night for my fiancés birthday.  She ordered lemon drops and I had mojitos all night.  Started with two delicious crab cakes, followed by halves of a Ceasar and wedge salads.  Then came the filet mignon, gorgonzola mac n cheese, and lobster mash potatoes.  We were stuffed but of course had to try their famous butter cake and we were so glad we did!  The filets were a tad more rare than we like but we're still great and my fiancé said the lemon drops, Mac n cheese, and the butter cake were the best dishes she's ever eaten! That says a lot since we frequent places like Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse, PRIME st Bellagio, N9NE at Palms, SW at Wynn, to name a few for special occasions. 

It's a great place and we will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"By far the best dining experience I have ever had. LR and his team were amazing!! The food was mind blowing! For appetizers we had caviar, king crab cocktail, crab cakes and smoked salon. Entrees we did family style and had the sea bass, blackened halibut, bone in rib eye (18oz), twin lobster tails, Gorgonzola Mac and cheese, king crab truffle gnocchi, sea salt and vinegar fries and asparagus. Everything was amazing! Even the wine was delicious! We started with a Duckhorn Merlot from the coravin section and ended with another red that I can't remember because I was mesmerized by the food. Thank you for the amazing experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible restaurant!!!  You must have the warm butter cake for dessert!!!!!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why Mastro's has such high reviews.  Good service and incredible food.  My experience was no different.

From the outside, the restaurant is housed in a cool modern treehouse.  On the inside, it's what you would expect from your typical fine-dining establishment.  The service here is attentive and accommodating.   They pay attention to detail by offering a black or white napkin depending on your attire. 

The food?  Perhaps some of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Let's start with the bread basket.  It was mixed with a variety of carb-loaded treats.  Olive focaccia, soft pretzel, etc.  

We ordered the Spicy Mambo Salad and the Ocean Club House Salad for the table.  Both portions were very generous and each is enough for an individual meal.  Both were delicious but have their own individual personalities.  The Spicy Mambo Salad has no protein and is reminiscent of a caesar salad with hints of wasabi.  The Ocean Club House Salad had bits of lobster and shrimp and were well balanced.  We also order a side of macaroni and cheese for the table.  The \"side\" was huge and plenty for a table.  In fact, we had some left over for a party of seven.  Again, delicious.

For my entree, I had the 12 oz. filet.  I ordered it medium rare as I normally do.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender to the point that I could have peel off pieces with only my fork.  It's arguably the best steak I've ever had.  A friend order the sea bass, and unlike other fine-dining restaurants I've been to... the portion was huge.  The sea bass had a lightly seasoned crust and super white in color throughout.  It was flaky, yet melted in your mouth.  This was by far the best sea bass I've ever had. 

The reasons I didn't give Mastro's five-stars?  Three reasons.  First, the waiter seemed to have a little attitude when one of our guests requested separate checks.  And second, they had a band playing there that night.  I'm not sure if this is a common nightly play.  But, I'd rather not listen to a 70's - 90's cover band while I eat a fine meal.  Lastly, I couldn't overcome the fact that every time I looked around... I was still in a retail shopping center.  I love views, but not that of shoppers walking in and out of Louis Vuitton, Prada, etc."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Mastro's couple of times now and usually has been top notch and no complaints, but this time wasn't a great experience.  If you come to Mastro's expect to drop some coin, we usually come here for some sort of celebration, birthdays, graduations, etc.  Well I wanted to take my girlfriend out for a nice birthday dinner.  We made reservation at 8:00.  We arrived at 7:45 and a little early.  The hostess said they are getting our table ready.  So we waited and went to the bar to order some drinks.  We went back to the hostess at 8:00 waiting for our table.  This time she said, \"Dinners are taking longer than usual, just waiting for our table to clear.\"  I didn't say anything, didn't want to embarrass my lady, especially on her birthday, but I thought to myself, why make a reservation, if you can't keep it?  Well we finished our drinks and it was about 8:20 now, and I asked the same hostess is our table ready?  She then asked if I made an reservation?  Considering this is the 3rd time I've talked to you, you should of known I made an reservation at 8:00.  She said she'll speak with a manager to see if our table is ready.  Minutes later she finally came back and said our table to ready.  I looked at my watch and it was 8:40.  I was pretty pissed and ticked off, but brushed it aside and didn't say anything.

Other than that little debacle, everything was great.  The food was outstanding and the service was good.  We ordered the Filet and NY Strip and shared some sides.  

I usually don't like to complain or post stuff on Yelp, but it really irked me how the hostess acted and had a \"I don't give a sh*t attitude\"  I wish I could compliment the service or talk more about the food, but managment did nothing to recify the situation or comp anything.  There are a lot of expensive and great steakhouses in Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I may want to venture out and give other places a try."}
{"text":"We booked our reservations 4 weeks prior from California since we were going to Spring Training in Scottsdale. Mastro's called to re-confirm, no problem. We arrived for our dinner and were taken to the worst table in the front room. We told the staffer we were visiting from California and had made the reservations 4 weeks ago--asking if they could give us a better table. After looking at their assignments, they sat us at a table where I had a clear view of the Restrooms sign. I was not happy and they knew it.
The waiter was decent and so was the food but the seating placement at 6:20 p.m. when they were not busy yet did not leave me very happy. I would never return to this restaurant when there are so many others."}
{"text":"Comfy bar tables, and almost every entree was excellent...The Filet was perfect, one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had, 5*+ but the NY Strip was average at best. All the sides were excellent and service was great too. Overall a great experience and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Always a wonderful meal and a great atmosphere thanks to the manager Phil and his wonderful staff.  He always make you feel like a VIP, no matter who you are!  My son's took me there for a birthday dinner.  The oysters Rockefeller were delicious as was the filet and the New York strip steak.  Our server and the entire staff made it a fantastic evening!  Thanks again.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy, yummy...I got love in my tummy!  The food here was absolutely delightful and delicious.  The service was great and the patrons were fun!  During my trips to Arizona I normally frequent the Mastro's Steakhouse, but I decided to switch it up this time.  I couldn't be happier I did!

We ended up getting there early and the place was jammed pack and had live music...It was like part HH, part fine dining...The best of both worlds, I say.  We went to the bar in the back and hung out there until our table was ready.  

Word to the wise, the drinks are expensive, BUT you get a mixer/tumbler that evens it all out.  We ordered two drinks and it came to around $50.  We were like, \"Uhhh, did you accidentally charge us for someone else's drinks, as well?!\"  Thankfully, my tasty Cosmo with the mixer/tumbler was like three drinks... 3 Cosmos for ~$25, not a bad deal:-)

All the patrons at the bar were so friendly and chatted with us...there was a hodgepodge of different styles and crowds blended in, but still kept an air of an \"upscale\" spot.  

The food was great...unfortunately, I cannot recall what we had, as we had a variety of dishes and left with our bellies filled to the max.

Shout-out to the manager, Steve, who followed up our dining experience with a \"thank you for being a patron\" call!

I will DEFINITELY be stopping at this restaurant each & every time I am in town and recommend everyone do the same:-)"}
{"text":"My family celebrated Christmas Eve 2017 at Mastro's Ocean Club, the staff was welcoming, happy and attentive. The food was delicious! New York Strip, Bone-In Rib eye, and Lobster were PERFECT! Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Creamed Spinach and Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese did not disappoint!  Mastro's in Las Vegas is a MUST!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Mastro's. My groomsmen took me here for a part of my bachelors party. Had the New York Strip steak medium rare. It was cooked for perfection. No need for A1 steaksauce because you only put that on a crappy steak. This place does not have a crappy steak at all. The steak cut real nice, it was juicy, tender and flavorful. The sides were awesome too. The cream corn was very delicious. It was creamy and the corn did not taste like something out of a can. Also had the shoe string onion strips and they went well with the steak and sides. If you have to splurge on a steak, this is a place to do it at!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a reservation here Sunday night with a few of our out of town friends. This was my first time at Ocean Club seeing as we normally go to City Hall behind Fashion Square. Let me tell you, Ocean Club lived up to the Mastros name! 

All four of us ordered steaks and they all were cooked to perfection. The mac n cheese (a favorite of mine) and the asparagus were the perfect sides and of course, how could I have forgotten the pretzel bread to start (delish!) 

I just have one minor complaint. I always order the petite filet and, in the past, it was always an 8 oz for $40. However, I guess Mastros just started selling the petite filet in a 6oz (trust me, the 2 extra oz make a huge difference when it comes to filling up your stomach). You can order the 8oz for, I dont know, I think $10+ -, which is the smallest complaint. But I mean, I'm already paying $40 ... why should I have to pay an extra $10 for what I normally always get?? 

Anywho... we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be back without question."}
{"text":"As usual, the Ocean Club was packed - on a Tuesday night!  My favorite thing about this establishment is the superior training and execution delivered by the staff - from the front to the back of the restaurant. You sense it immediately. And you sense how engaged the staff is in delivering exceptional customer experiences. They move quick, think fast, and don't miss the details - but they still take time to build rapport with each table. And then there's the food!  I ordered a New York Strip, medium rare, that was absolutely marvelous!  The signature seasoning applied to their steaks really sets them and finishes the taste of the fine beef well.  Mastro's know fine dining and they deliver it - every time!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I started with Conundrum Mixed White from Cali, then had the Chilean Sea Bass Ponzu (FREAKING AMAZING) and the Jalepeno Tuna Shashimi... Both are amazing appetizers. I then ordered the Sea Scallops and the side of brown butter Brussel Sprouts... I've never had a side as good as THOSE BRUSSEL SPROUTS! Addicting. I was dreaming about them last night! The Scallops are in a butter sauce that I could drink! Thankfully they serve the dish with bread to soak up some of the amazing sauce! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and visit this restaurant! The staff is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, and awesome live jazz band. It's a great restaurant. Love the architecture of this place. I had the Burrata salad, Ocean Club Crab Cakes, Chopped Salad, Chilean Sea Bass, and Filet Steak. My favorites were tomato & mozzarella and the chilean sea bass. Very good quality."}
{"text":"Went to Mastro's before a show. Scott was our server and was excellent. Had a full dozen oyster's on the half shell which were just out of the ocean fresh and delicious! I ordered Sea Bass blackened and it was melt in your mouth perfect! The lobster mashed were delish as was the house dessert, Warm Butter Cake, served with loads of fresh homemade whipped cream! Servings are large and we all had leftovers. Loved sitting in the treehouse. We do have a few suggestions: The entrance is so boring and the piano is shoved way back in a back corner that you would never notice it. How about putting the piano up front somewhere? Such a wonderful restaurant needs a a better first impression. Also, we had called and asked for a 7:30 reservation and were told it was not available but 8:30 was. That was too late for us to make our show, so reservationist suggested 7. We arrived and were seated at 7 and the restaurant was no more than half full until past 8 pm!! So why couldn't we have come at 7:30 as we first asked? I mentioned this to a manager who approached our table mid-meal  and he said, \"Well, sometimes things change.\" HUH??? Terrible response. Nevertheless, we loved our dinner and the service was fabulous. We can't wait to go back. We're already saving up!"}
{"text":"Been to two Mastro's: Costa Mesa and Vegas. Both amazing food, but Vegas is in a treehouse -- AWESOME! I've always wanted to dine in a treehouse!

Mastro's is my favorite steakhouse. Mastro's Ocean Club was by far THE most expensive dinner I've EVER had (almost a grand including tips for two), but it was so @#$%^&!%$#! good! 

What we ordered:

- Cosmo with dry ice
- Mastro's Signature Seafood Tower with caviar* and lobster cocktail
- Escargot with puff pastry
- Tomahawk (bone-in ribeye)
- Lobster mashed potatoes
- Dessert? I'll pass. I just want my steak and lobster mash!!

* Seafood tower with caviar was the main item that drove up the bill. (i think it was 200-300 just for that). It's definitely feasible to have a more affordable dinner at Mastro's.

Writing this review makes me wanna go back to Vegas and order the tomahawk again. oh. my. gosh. sooooo amazing!!

Seafood tower: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q?select=oPEzJjzR1ULqM-CN83Ifrg#dtVcN9PnhWnehy8bq6XLFw"}
{"text":"Perfect on every aspect! I tried the Wagyu steak (for the first time of my life), my wife got the surf and turf. Food was absolutely fantastic! Wine suggestion was perfect and service on top! The birthday cake was a nice attention... but at that point it was too much food :)  Will go back!"}
{"text":"This place is the creme of the creme. Everything we tried on the menu was superb! I highly recommend the Oysters, Chilean Sea Bass & Filet. Everyone in our group of 6 walked away satisfied and very full."}
{"text":"This is one of the few Mastros that offer the vanilla battered fried lobster tail mmmm. Not all do"}
{"text":"For starters I really wanted to give this place a great review because the food was good, but after receiving my bill I just can't do it.

Our total bill came up to $243.23. That's not my complaint. My complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. I'm glad I kept my receipt.

This prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. The manager told me that the company they use AUTOMATICALLY adds a 20% gratuity to the bill. 

This was not disclosed to us by the waitress. It was not disclosed on our receipt. In fact, when I called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. FIX IT if people are complaining. You have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this BEFORE  they eat.

Tips are VOLUNTARY, not mandatory unless disclosed. I leave my tips in cash and I always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  The money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. That is basically theft. 

So now, I have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means I won't see my money until Tuesday or Wednesday, since we ate there Friday night. Other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.

1) The customer service is great except for not disclosing that I'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.

2) The  crab cakes were good, but both my wife and I had a small piece of shell. Nothing worth complaining about.

3) My wife had the blackened ribeye. It was delicious.

4) I had rack of lamb. it was delicious.

5) Twice baked potato was good.

6) Gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.

7) Clam chowder was good.

8) Calamari was just OK.

9) The complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. I don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us. 

Overall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.

If you eat here PAY CASH."}
{"text":"This review is for the warm butter cake!!!

A friend of mine found out I was in Vegas for my birthday and all he said was make sure you go to Mastro's Ocean Club for the warm butter cake. I was like ok...I'll try it.  He was like no, you better try it.

So, I was on a hunt to try this warm butter cake.  To my surprise, my hotel is literally across the street from the place. 

We get to the place at 11:30pm and the hostess tells us we're closed and we're bummed.  Bummed because we're scheduled to leave tomorrow and wouldn't have the chance to try it.  We begged to just sit at the bar and see if they would let us order dessert. She said sure...YAY :)

Got to the bar, looked at the menu and the bartender said you have to try our signature dessert dish and we said ok but we're here for one thing and he said the warm butter cake and we were like YES!!!!!

When it came out it was sooo beautiful.  To cute to cut!!! The cuteness didn't last long.  We took our first bite and OMG...decadence!!!! It was mouth watering. It was fabulous. It was soooooooo sweet and so good.  i could feel my sugar levels going up but I didn't care :)

Gotta try it!!!"}
{"text":"Yay - I've always wanted to eat in the Tree restaurant inside City Center! :D

Unfortunately, we were not actually seated inside the tree, but tis okay! Our group of 5 (3 other girls were too drunk to make it, but anyhows), was seated near the door. Hint - if you are seated along the wall, make sure you sit in the booth with the white plush walls. Awesome to lean your head against!

Our waitstaff was superb, although I was a bit sad when they didn't offer any comp things for our meals taking so long! Womp. Also, our table was super dim, we could barely see each other.

As a party of 5 girls (and our first and only meal of the day), we had:

* Seafood tower w/ oysters, claws, jumbo shrimp, crab. Uhhmaaayyyzing. Get this. Pick whatever you want. I'd go without the oysters as they clocked in about $5/each and were not mind blowing. DEFINITELY get the jumbo shrimp - they were huge and already peeled! There are few things better than that in the world.

* Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocci. UMMMM I am OBSESSED w. this dish. So buttery, so creamy, so YUMMY! I could not stop gobbling this ish up. 

* Lobster Mashed Potatoes - nomnomnom! Had huge chunks of fresh luscious lobster nestled within the creamy mashed potatoes. Fan! 

* The special 32oz kobe steak, cooked medium rare. This was perfection. $98 worth of absolute perfection. The steak was a perfect pink and melted in my mouth. The leftovers even tasted amazing. 

* Chilean Sea Bass, blackened per our waiter's recco. Unfortunately, I didn't love this dish....so i don't really have much to say about it. I think it had more to do with the way it was prepared (I generally don't have my fish blackened) than the fish itself - but not impressed.

Two girls split a bottle of red vino for just $33 - surprisingly priced at such a nice resto.

At the end, our bill came out to just about $100 pp. Pricey - definitely, but I think it's worth it! Make sure to request a tree house table!

Oh - at the end of the meal, our waiter gave us to-go sippy cups for the rest of our vino! He also jokingly asked if my drunkie friend would also like a cup of agua to go ;) puuahaha"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd trip there after 6 years.  We convinced another couple to go out with us to celebrate a year of being self-employed.  Unfortunately, we did not have the same wonderful experience this time around and probably won't be back.  We ended up spending $600 for 4 people, and at $150/pp we did expect perfection, which we didn't get.  

SERVICE - 3/5
Overall, it was an OK experience.  Waitress was very friendly, pleasant, and provided recommendations.  The only ding here is that the person that brought the food out seemed to be in a rush.  He was scrambling while serving everyone with a spoonful of the first side dish and reached over from the end of the table to serve the ladies who were sitting by the window.  As soon as he grabbed the second side dish 3 of us told him just to leave it at the table and we'd take care of it.   We've eaten at Capital Grille, Flemings,  Donovans, Modern Steak, and this has never happened.  

AMBIANCE - 2/5
It was a Saturday night.  The bar area was lively and packed with people.  There was a live band.  The band was fairly loud, which may be OK if they sounded decent.  However, it did sound very amateurish which was annoying and really put a damper on the overall experience.  We even asked the waitress if it was karaoke night, and she laughed.  She mentioned another table asked her the same thing.  

APPETIZERS - 4/5
We ordered 2 appetizers, sea scallops and crab cakes.  They were both great, no complaints.   The appetizers were probably the highlight because things just went downhill from there. :(

SIDES - 3/5
We got 2 orders of lobster bisque, split between each couple.  The bisque was creamy, tasted OK, had small chunks of lobster, but the lobster taste was very subtle that the tomato/cream overpowered it.  We weren't too impressed with it.  We then ordered the highly recommended lobster mash potatoes, and the truffle/crab gnocchi.   @ $35 for the gnocchi, we expected chunks of crab;  we weren't impressed with it and it was pretty much untouched beyond the first taste.  Lobster mash was pretty good as we expected.

MAIN COURSE- 2/5
We ordered sea bass, halibut, bone-in rib eye, and lamb chops.  Rib eye was ordered medium, but it arrived medium well to well with barely any pink.  The lamb chops were also over cooked, sea bass was good, halibut had a crust but lacked salt and flavor.  Ended up getting the steak replaced, but the replacement was under-cooked (looked and tasted medium-rare), but at this point we just boxed it and munched on the rest of the food.  For a $50 steak, I was expecting perfection, something that rivals what I get at capital grille/modern steak/Fleming's/Donovan's, but this was a big disappointment.  Oh, the waitress ended up bringing us a complimentary desert to make up for the steak, but I did get charged for the steak.

Bottom-line is we expected perfection, and all 4 of us felt disappointed and let down."}
{"text":"try to come here few times a year and always have the steaks which are amazing. This time I thought I'd try something else and had the ahi seared tuna...amazing. Also had the usual sides of lobster mashed potatoes and butter cake for desert. Service, menu, and atmosphere can't be best."}
{"text":"Wow, what a huge disappointment!  I have always heard good things about this chain, including this location in Vegas.  This is a high-end (very pricey) steak joint, so you expect (a) a REALLY good steak and (b) prompt efficient service.  Ocean Club failed on both counts during our recent dinner.  Had we not been pressed for time, I definitely would have had a candid (blunt) discussion with the manager regarding our disappointment.  Our party of 12 was promptly seated and we had two waiters to handle the large party.  
Failure #1 - drink orders were taken from the ladies and those came out quickly (within 5-10 minutes); they didn't take drink orders from the guys for another 5-10 minutes and we waited a good 15 minutes before they came out.  They messed up on two of the drink orders (stuff that shouldn't have been a mistake).
Failure #2 - they screwed up on one of the steak orders (ordered rib-eye - I was sitting right next to him, so I knew that is what he ordered), they apologized profusely and said they would expedite the correct steak.  10 minutes later guess what comes out?  The WRONG steak again!  Fortunately most of the guys got larger steaks, so we shared so that our friend wouldn't be left eating alone.
Failure #3 - I had ordered my steak medium rare, but it came out much closer to medium-well.  For a high-end steakhouse, this should never happen - steaks should come out consistent / match what the customer ordered.

The only positive note was the side dishes were all very good.  Other reviews are consistent on the rave reviews of the sides.

Given how much we spent on dinner, it was a massive disappointment.  

8/31 Update - after posting my review, I did get a personal call from the GM of the restaurant.  He was very apologetic and I believe he was sincere in soliciting my feedback to ensure the risk of this happening to other patrons is minimized.  As a gesture of good faith, he did offer a gift card for use at any Mastro's location.  To be honest, had this call not happened, I would have never set foot in this restaurant chain again.  But, because of this gesture, we did go to the Beverly Hills location and had an AMAZING meal (I'll post a separate review for that location)."}
{"text":"Jean George's was closed at aria, so host recommended mastros. All was perfect. Went out of their way to see everyone satisfied. Great customer service.

{"text":"Insane collection of meat and seafood. I guess you can find stuff to nibble on here, but why? Epic portions of well prepared seafood and meat. A wagyu bone-in rib-eye doesn't come by very often. Holy jeez what a fantastic steak! I actually could not stop eating it. With the surf accompaniment of a grilled lobster tail - I was like in food Valhalla! And although they claim the restaurant in in a tree-house in the middle of a money mall, the caliber of the food let me overlook the pretentious vibe for the most part! Not for the penny-pincher!!!"}

{"text":"BEST FOOD ON THE STRIP! Holy crap. This is one of the best meals I've ever eaten in my life! Portions are big but two of us shared 2 entrees and 3 small sides because we couldn't decide what to get! Mac n cheese, mashed potatoes and the crab gnocchi. All of them were so amazing and unlike anything I've ever eaten! And don't forget to save room for the butter cake!!"}
{"text":"Quite pricey but you honestly get what you pay for and more here. One of my favorite places to eat on special occasions. I went here first with my girlfriend for an anniversary and also with my family for New Years. I recommend their fish since they are known for their seafood here. The service is top notch and be sure to tell them if you came for an anniversary since they usually hook you up with some sort of dessert! If you like alcohol with your meal I definitely recommend their lemon drops. It was so amazing I asked the waiter how they make it and they told me they soak their vodka with lemons for a long period of time to get the flavor. It tastes so delicious I could barely tell there was any alcohol in it but I felt it hit me after a glass. One of the best drinks I have ever tried. Be sure to make a reservation as well. I never had too much trouble making one and they did seat me earlier since we got there 20 minutes early but it always seems quite packed. This restaurant would definitely make my top 5 of the best restaurants I have gone to in terms of service and food quality."}
{"text":"This place is so good and totally worth the Vegas prices (note that you will probably spend about $100 per person). From reading many Yelp reviews, I developed a strategy. Share one of the bigger steaks with one person (because it's cheaper that way) and then split the sides with everyone. You will be super full - unless you love steak so much that you just have to have your own. I think the way most people do it is that they order their main dish - whether it be steak or seafood - and then you order a bunch of sides that the servers split and put on your plate.

We came with a party of six, and so here's what we got: 

- I split a 12 oz filet with one other person, and they will totally plate it for you if you tell them you are splitting it. Two of my other friends split the 16 oz bone-in. And one of our friends got their special wagyu steak. I will say that I'm not a super huge fan of steak, but the steak here was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and the wagyu was incredible. Best steak I've ever eaten - the perfect ratio of fat and meat made it just melt in your mouth. 

- Lobster Mashed Potatoes: We were on the fence about this side dish because some of the reviews were meh about it. However, I'd say get it! The big chunks of lobster in the creamy mashed potatoes makes it so delicious. If you like lobster and mashed potatoes, definitely go for this dish. They put quite a bit of lobster in here - hence the hefty price tag of $35. 

- Alaskan Crab Truffle Gnocchi: This is super delicious as well. The gnocchi is soft and pillowy the way it's supposed to be and the truffle flavor is perfect. I didn't really get pieces of crab in the serving I got, but I know the crab was in there. 

- Brussel Sprouts: This was the only dish that was actually not done well to me. I like my brussel sprouts with a bit of caramelization and soft on the inside. Some of these just tasted incredibly burnt and the flavor wasn't great. I would pass on this as a side next time. 

- Mac & Cheese: This mac & cheese was pretty excellent. The noodles were cooked perfectly and it was amazingly cheesy. It was so cheesy that it did that stringy cheese thing when the server put it on our plate. A classically delicious side! 

For dessert, we listened to the rave reviews and got the butter cake. And you know what, it was underwhelming to me. I like desserts that are lighter and less sweet, especially after we got such a crazy rich meal. The warm butter cake is extremely rich, it comes with a dollop on ice cream on top and a side of whipped cream. It is more than enough to share between six people, especially after the meal we had. I personally thought it was too rich and sweet, but enough people have raved about it on here that you should give it a try. 

The service here is very good. I especially appreciate that our server stopped us from getting two sides of the gnocchi. He thought it would be wayyy too much food for us and he was totally right. All in all, this was an incredibly rich and decadent meal and totally delicious. I would definitely come back again for some of the things we got."}
{"text":"We only stopped in for an appetizer and drinks, but I have to say I will be back very soon!  The lemon drop was an experience that was the perfect start to our girls' night out.  I won't ruin the surprise, but you have to get one.  We also had the shrimp cocktail  which was perfect, containing large, firm shrimp served extra cold with the spiciest horseradish I have ever had (Yum).  But the best part was the staff.  Daniel, Jacob, Brandon, and Claira treated us like we were royalty (Ok, I was there with a regular), but they welcomed me into the \"family.\"  I now live in the area so I will definitely be bringing my many visitors back here.  I hear I need to try the sea bass and the butter cake.  Looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best steaks I've ever had.  I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food and how good the waitstaff was.  They even comped us some deserts and a portion of our meal due to a couple of the guys being former military.  If you're looking for a good steak, this place is for you."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time to this particular restaurant.  This time was kinda disappointing.  I have brought my over-sea clients to this restaurant and the service was 30% of what it used to be.  Our waiter kept chatting with other waiters and it took us 3 times to raise our hands to get his attention for both times.  When I had asked about the types of steaks, he answered as if I was supposed to know that with \"Obviously\", \"of course this type of steak is more firm...\"  we really do not appreciate that.  We pay high price to came to enjoy the food and environment, not to be treated as if it is our job to know the types of food.  The food was good, but our party of 9 people who are all business owners said they liked the food, but agreed that for this class level of spending, the service was very disappointing and substandard.  We did see that services were much better at other tables...seems as if our waiter has a little discriminative to Asians.  As a result, we gave 10% of the service tip instead of the 20% I usually give at this restaurant.  This will be my last time taking clients to this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. While known for great seafood, the steaks are amazing as well.  Make sure to save room for Butter cake.  Nice atmoshpere.  We go here often.  In my opinion Delmonico at Venitian, Strip Steak at Mandalay Bay,  and Craft at MGM dont compare."}
{"text":"I was out here celebrating my birthday for the second straight year (yes, it's cliché - I'm perfectly OK with that) with my baby brother. We wanted steak, but didn't necessarily want to spend an arm and a leg. Well, we succeeded at the former, if not the latter, but we left very happy and very, very full.

We settled into the bar and I asked the bartender about the dry-iced martini. It was at that point I discovered the bar was much more about the fufu martinis rather than classic. I'm partial to the classics, so I was a bit disappointed. That said, that's E-Me - I should have checked out the menu in advance, or read a couple more Yelp reviews. (Take note if you're looking for a classic cocktail here, you won't find it.) I wound up going with the on the menu manhattan, which was very good, but not great.

Now it was time to settle into the real reason for going - meat. We had a bit of a conversation with the very friendly bartender about what was good and must-haves on the menu. We already knew we were having the bone marrow, which she did recommend. We talked steak and sides, when she insisted we have the brussel sprouts. Now, I'm not much of a brussel sprout fan, but given the recommendation that was given I figured we had to have them.

The bone marrow came out and it was two huge bones. I could have slid down them - I'd have been a very happy man if I had. The marrow was plentiful and delicious. You won't have to scrape just to get a little, you'll be scraping just to get the last little bit of all that wonderful marrow goodness.

Now for the steak. I did the bone-in ribeye, which came out perfectly rare - if not maybe a touch too rare, which is very weird for me to say. That said, it was amazingly flavorful and near melt-in-your-mouth. And the brussel sprouts - well, I'm not a true convert yet, but if you keep serving me more like these I might change my ways.

Then, on to dessert. A huge, and delicious, butter cake. We couldn't stop eating it despite the fact that we were absolutely stuffed.

In the end, and for the money, I do think there are better steak experiences to be had on the strip. That said, you absolutely can't go wrong with a stop to Mastro's."}
{"text":"I've debated about how many stars I should rate Mastro's Ocean Club, technically it deserves one less due to what happened during my dinning experience here but the customer service made up for a lot of the mistakes.

I was in Vegas with my girlfriend who had been there for a company conference, it so happened to also be my birthday weekend and I wanted an amazing meal on my Birthday before we headed back to LA. Mastro's had always been well recommended by friends and family so i was excited to have a birthday meal there. We have a few locations in the Los Angeles area but never had a opportunity to dine at one. 

We arrived a few minutes after opening and were seated promptly, our server (I forget his name :( so sorry) was amazing! Was very informative and accommodating. My girlfriend ordered the chilean sea bass and one prawn. I had the bone in rib eye steak and we shared a side of green beans and asparagus. My girlfriend ordered a delicious drink and while I couldn't decide on what to have myself our waiter brought out a amazing whiskey drink for me. 

Once the food arrived it all looked so yummy, and here is when the problems began. I had ordered my steak medium rare, when I cut into the steak it was more medium / medium well. I thought maybe it was just the surrounding edges that were overcooked because that tends to happen with rib eye steaks. Once I cut closer to the bone it was evident it was overcooked. I called over the waiter and quickly had my steak sent back and a new one was on its way out. My girlfriends sea bass was amazing but the prawn she ordered was overcooked. While I waited for my replacement steak to arrive the manager came to our table to offer their apologies which was much appreciated. My replacement steak took quite some time enough time for my girlfriend to finish her meal while I sat there waiting for my food. 

Once my new steak arrived I was eager to eat, the manager had them bring out fresh new sides which was unexpected but very appreciated. Manager had me cut into the steak to see if it was cooked properly and sadly it was also overcooked. I was disappointed and as I cut further in to check the center of the steak it was evident this steak was overcooked as well as chewy. The manager acknowledged it was overcooked and offered a replacement but at this point I just wanted to eat! I told him it was ok and that I would finish my steak and be on our way, needless to say my steak was comped. A few minutes into my second steak the manager let me know that they had another steak for me and I should slow down on finishing this one. I advised him I had no desire for a third steak and that there was no way I could finish it but he insisted.

My third steak was brought out and my second was taken away, again the manager asked me to check the cook on this third steak. Upon cutting into the steak it was raw, very raw...almost a blue steak. I was really disappointed at this point and the manager just walked away. Our server came to our table and asked me \"Do you like your steak like that?\" acknowledging how undercooked it was. At this point I was so upset that I just wanted to eat but could only finish a few extra bites. The manager brought out a free dessert with Happy Birthday written on the dish which was freaking delicious. The customer service is is really fantastic I can't stress that enough. Drinks are fantastic and the wait staff is top notch! And the steak was fantastic the next day when I had to for lunch and was reheated to a proper temp ;) 

I'll definitely return here for a second meal regardless of all the problems I experienced as I truly believe they deserve a second chance and I'll update my review accordingly. Thanks again to the staff at Mastro's Ocean Club for great service and attention. Special thanks to our waiter who was fantastic and to the manager who went above and beyond."}
{"text":"Things I love in this world:

1. Fish
2. Steak
3. Old rich guys
4. HUGE fake boobs
5. Cougars with huge fake boobs
6. The circus

So this much is pretty much like Disneyland and for me. Circus boobs aside, this place has great food. Everything from the hot pretzels in the bread basket to the extensive selection of fresh fish is fantastic. The service is usually pretty good and they make a mean dirty martini.

And did I mention all the fake boobs?

Perfection."}
{"text":"Best service and amazing food. My husband and I came for our anniversary and had a great time with good drinks and food. My sea bass pan seared was cooked to perfection. My husband had the bone in filet which was not only cooked perfect but the flavor  was fantastic. Simple yet flavorful and then the sides just amazing. The Mac and cheese could be a meal in itself with how cheesy and delicious it was. The garlic mash so creamy and almost melted in your mouth. Last but not least their signature desert, butter cake. To die for. Came with home made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood restaurant in the valley.  Highly recommended to anyone looking for great food and an great atmosphere.  The bar is also a great place to grab a drink if your in the area and not wanting a meal.  Service is always 110 percent. I'd eat here weakly if it was in my budget to do so.  Top Notch food, excellent service, and a fun atmosphere.  There's not much more you can expect."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the service does not match the ambience and food. There was a guy walking around with a suit on, he was friendly. Our server was not friendly. 

The petite filet and lobster mashed potatoes were excellent. The roasted Brussel sprouts were good also. I had the elderflower martini without the sugar rim, nice but pricey (along with most martinis in Vegas). We sat in the treehouse, which was a wonderful experience. Overall, this was an excellent experience, however, I have been to several restaurants that offer the total package."}
{"text":"What is there bad to say about this place except my stomach can't expand enough to keep eating everything in sight.  Seafood was so fresh and delish.  Side dishes were to die for.  Great martinis.  Excellent service and ambiance."}
{"text":"***UPDATE***
After posting the following review, I was contacted via Yelp by a person calling herself \"Kate G.\". Kate stated, \"I would like to get your phone number so that our corporate side can look into this and discuss.\" I asked Kate G. who she was & she stated she was Landry's Social Media Coordinator. Why didn't you tell me that in your first e-mail? Ummm, I don't hand out my phone number to random internet contacts!
Why on earth would I give my phone number to Kate? Does she think I want to be bothered my her or Corporate? I can't be bought off with a gift certificate from Landry's. I will never eat there again. I filed a complaint with the Southern Nevada Health District!!! So, listen up Kate G., you can NOT have any of my personal information. May I suggest you introduce yourself before asking for someone's phone number. BTW, I still have nightmares over what happened to me! 

I got so ill after eating here I thought I would die. Never again! I had a steak, loaded potato, green beans & one glass of wine. I'll have PTSD whenever I think of that night."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 100 stars I would.  

Found this steakhouse on Yelp and 4  1/2 stars rarely disappoints so I made reservations via Open Table.  I found a few websites suggesting other steakhouses but I found them all to be owned by famous people and didn't want to dine at place based on being known by their owners.  I'm so glad I went with Mastro's.  So first off, yes, it is in a mall but I had no issues with that.  We sat in the 'treehouse' which faced all the high-end stores but never did I think it was awkward.  I mean....high-end steakhouse in a high-end mall, surrounded by high-end retail stores.  Nothing wrong with that.  What really counts is the FOOD and ambiance.

For a little less than $200, my husband and I each ordered an appetizer, salad, drink, an entrée, and shared a side dish.  We had a late lunch so didn't order many sides.  We got the Brussel sprouts which were more than enough for two people.  A third would've been ok too.  The steak was DELSIH!  I have to say prob the best steak I've EVER had and I've had some of the best.  The steak literally MELTS in your mouth and before I even moved my knife to cut it, the tip of the knife t split the top of the steak open, that's how tender their steak is.  At first I was like whoa, $17 for a drink?  Well, you get them for free at the casino for a reason....it's prob watered down and not the best quality alcohol.  $17 actually gets you what appears to be more like two drinks as they leave the shaker on your table and that serves another glass.  By the way, the drinks were all delish as well.

The other highlight of the night, as if it wasn't the food itself wasn't enough, was the staff.  Our waiter Daniel Ellery was awesome.  Not only was he super nice and very courteous, but he was very knowledgeable about the menu.  My pet peeve is when you ask about certain dishes and how they are prepared and the waiter say, \"Oh, I don't know.  Let me get back to you.\"  Anyhow, I really enjoyed our dinner and the ambiance.  Everything was perfect for my birthday weekend, which by the way, they brought out a very lovely chocolate cake.  I'm not usually a sweets person but this cake was sooooo good.  Not too sweet and creamy.  It was delish!

Will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"I felt so bad last night for the entire staff.....Arrived at 930pm for our reservation to a crowded lobby, evidently the restaurant's entire computer system went down and they lost everything including orders and the ability to process customer's bills.  I will not fault the restaurant and certainly not the staff for circumstances beyond their control! It was late and we decided to stay and wait it out with the other guests, the staff not only served champagne to us in the lobby but also brought bread baskets to whoever wanted them.  We got seated 40 minutes later (again not their fault) our server was friendly and courteous and told us the the entire wait staff had to physically remember every customers order/drinks/how many drinks/ what wine went to what table in order to process their bill, it sounded like a nightmare I felt so bad.  The restaurant even bought our first cocktail for the inconvenience which after the champagne I felt it wasn't necessary for me I felt they handled it very well already.  We started off with the sautéed shrimp as an appetizer light sauce with an amazing flavor served with seasoned bread, a little overkill considering their bread comes to the table anyway how many carbs do you need? I would have been fine with just the shrimp.  8oz petite Filet came on a sizzling plate as always, good char excellent flavor.  Garlic mashed potatoes and sautéed asparagus perfectly prepared.  A side note about Mastros I do like how they serve you the sides and vegetables on your plate, it might be overkill but a level of service that I appreciate.  As always I could have done without it this week but my friend insisted on the Butter cake with iced cream and homemade whipped cream (sinful) I hope people that night didn't take out the situation on the servers or the rest of the staff because they did the best they could in a bad situation!"}
{"text":"Just the facts:
We have been here five times.
We have been to both Las Vegas and Phoenix
All time fantastic
Unique view at the LV location
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated her recent birthday here on Monday evening 10/25/10 and enjoyed and amazing dinner that far exceeded our highest expectations. This new outpost of Mastros is romantic and elegant with all of the true hallmarks of five star dining. 
We have previously been to Mastros in Beverly Hills and I much preferred this location as food and service were flawless as we've come to expect with the added touch of refinement and class that Mastro Beverly Hills seems to lack with the Nightclub atmosphere and Hollywood infused scene. 

The Food:

Appetizer:

Seared Sea Scallops -  Perfectly seared and prepared in a Garlic cream sauce. Accompanied by 2 Garlic Toasted Bread Crisps. Delicous.

Entrees:

Petite Filet (Medium) - Hers - Simple but perfect. Mastro's signature entree and they do it to perfection

Rack Of Lamb (Medium Rare) - Mine -  I love Lamb above all other meats and this is one of the best I can ever remember having. Bold but not gamey it flavor.
(Jiraffe in Santa Monica is a close 2nd.)

Sides:

Sauteed Mushrooms w/ Onions  - Sweet & earthy. The perfect compliment to tender Filet & Lamb when combined with Mastro's Fries. 

Sea Salt Shoestring Fries (No Vinegar) - Crisp and salty which just the right amount of texture.

Dessert - 

Chocolate Birthday Cake - Brought out complimetary. Nothing special but a nice birthday gesture. 

Warm Butter Cake Ala Mode - You simply HAVE to get this! 
No meal at Mastro's would be complete without it. My wife talked about this for days before our meal and reminisced about it for days after. It's simply the best enormous warm, buttery sugar cookie you've ever had paired with the smoothest vanilla bean ice cream you can imagine.

 I have to say we left very impressed with our Mastro's Las Vegas experience. It definitely raises Mastro's to our favorite special occasion restaurant from now on (Just not the Beverly Hills location.)With food, service and atmosphere this wonderful you just can't go wrong. 

Next up for us is Mastros in Thousand Oaks."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Atmosphere is incredibly elegant, food and service out of this world!  Drinks are also amazing!  If you want an elegant steak dinner, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant excellent food! big portions, definitely for sharing.."}
{"text":"Top notch service and excellent drink selection on the menu. Great stop if you are looking for some relief from the heat out on the strip. Located at the shops at crystals on second floor. We were here in the summer just walking around in shorts and sandals. I needed a cold drink. My wife recommended going in but I thought there was no way in hell they would let me in with my Golden girls shirt and faded shorts. It wasn't a big deal, they let me right in. Sat at bar and ordered a few drinks. Drinks are a bit pricey but you probably know that already. Dining at the bar is offered. I wish I hadn't stuffed my face earlier. I wanted a steak but settled for cocktails. 

The bartenders were very courteous and made sure to check on us regularly. The highlight for me was meeting my all time favorite NBA player, Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers. I made sure to go over and say hello. He was very kind. I even named my tortoise after him that's how much I love magic. The summer league was going on and a bunch of NBA management and players were hanging around. I saw a bunch. 

Very dark inside the restaurant. Interesting how it opens up into the mall. Next time we will grab some steaks. Great place to hang out and people watch. Happy drinking!"}
{"text":"Came here as a finale to a Girls/Moms weekend in Vegas for Mother's Day. Our anticipation was high since we had enjoyed Mastros NYC in Sept 16 for our birthdays. I was extremely disappointed with the dinner service and attention; it was extremely slow and absolutely no comparison to the fabulous, high energy and attentive service we received in NYC. Our server did not cover any specials or explain the different steak and cut options. He was more concerned with putting away the menus than attending to us. Our drinks at the bar were great plus plentiful and the bartender was attentive and fabulous. Our meal was good, however we really came for the experience and the service. This location does not compare in service to NYC. The location is nice and open in the Crystals Mall but we expected much more. We spoke to the Manager after and he was concerned and said he would address it. We were so disappointed that we skipped the butter cake and high tailed it out of there. There are lots of options in Vegas so we will skip this one next time in town."}
{"text":"Dined at Mastro's for a birthday dinner over the Labor Day holiday. Overall, Come to Mastro's  for a superb fine dining experience on the strip.

Service: 5 stars. Our server Mike was wonderful.  He answered our many questions, has excellent wine recommendations and accommodated our many requests all with a smile. He and the team also heard us discuss our friend's birthday and they brought out a special treat.. 

Food: 5 stars.  For an appetizer ordered the custom seafood tower which I highly recommend - delicious. 
-Main dish: Char Oreganata style.Fish was cooked perfectly. Also  if ever ordering fish here do it oreganata style. Has bread crumbs, bacon pieces, etc. Soo good.  
-Dessert: We all loved the chocolate sin cake.  

Ambiance: 5 stars.  The layout, look and feel makes it intimate yet spacious."}
{"text":"Celebrating 50th birthday for my sister 
This is an amazing restaurant!!! We loved it. We celebrated my sisters 50th birthday and they made it so special.  Our server was a woman named Rene. We dined on May 12th.  We had the best filet mignon in Vegas ever.  We had the butter cake to die for ! We loved the lobster bisque and most of all.... the rad lemon drop which is a signature drink!!! Go eat and enjoy as often as you can!!! Tell them Tina sent you!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here for my husbands birthday and it was not what we were expecting. We had reservations and came on time. They had us waiting for over 20 minutes before we got a table and wen we finally sat down, it took awhile for the waiter to come take our order. We got our drinks (lemon drop is my favorite and it was delicious here) fast but our dinner took way too long. When we did get our food we barely ate it because we were so hungry we are the bread and had our drinks. Then the alarm went off and all the lights and sirens were flashing. It just wasn't what we were expecting."}
{"text":"What an amazing dinner last night. Our server Tim was awestruck me from start to finish. He acknowledged our honeymoon right away and even gave us an amazing dessert at the end. Being the night prior somewhere else being so bad he turned our trip around. The filet was amazing. Scallops as well! Even the host was awesome, giving us a great seat. Thank you!"}
{"text":"had dinner here last nite w/ my wife.Best swordfish i ever had.Perfectly done.Spectacular shrimp cocktail. flourless chocolate dessert was incredible.
My wife had chilean sea bass. To die for.
service was amazing! If u want a great dining experience come here!"}
{"text":"I'm not feeling up for a lengthy review so I'll keep it brief. For two of us, without wine and dessert (the later was comp'd by our Mandarin Oriental Concierge) our tab was $230 + tip. I can say without hesitation having dined all over the world, and eaten at the best steak houses in NYC, Chicago, Palm Springs and LA, this was NOT a $230 meal. At best it was worth $120. 

Food= Our seafood appetizers were delicious - oysters and shrimp. For dinner we ate fillets, lobster, au gratin potatoes, and creamed spinach. The meat was good, lobster decent, and sides very disappointing. Usually this is what makes a Steak house memorable -not here.  The warm \"pretzel bread\" and butter cake dessert were by far the most memorable portions of the meal.

Atmosphere = you're eating in a mall - albeit a beautifully designed mall with every luxury brand in the book, it's still a mall. Within the tree house where we dined, you watch mall walkers beneath you. Ouch.

Service= Very good, attentive, but not $230 good. 

Overall 3 stars. For all of us Zagat's goons, I'd go with Food=21, Decor=23, Service=23."}
{"text":"We went for my birthday and the butter cake is one of my  desserts of all time.  Shared many things this night and it made the price not exorbitant. Still a fan for very special occasions, service is always amazing."}
{"text":"It's a good thing we don't live any closer to the Ocean Club than we do (Minnesota), or I would be there all the time!  It was awsome, we went there for our anniversary and loved it.  Had lobster, green beans, lobster Mac and the sea food tower to start things out.  Everything was delicious, from the martinis to the complementary anniversary cake!  Our waiter was Steve he was incredible and the atmosphere was pleasant with the live music in the background.  The prices were justifiable due to the portions that you got. We will definitely plan on coming back when we are in town again."}
{"text":"Wow!  We had live Maine lobster and a New York steak which were absolutely perfect but the highlight might have been the Blue Point oysters which were sweet, tender and delicious. Wait a minute, that wasn't the highlight!  The highlight was the service which was attentive, friendly and helpful. Our waitress was so genuine that I thought I had been transported to somewhere in the Midwest. This place is a must go!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. A wow factor dining experience start to finish. The seafood tower is fresh, fun and a festive way to start the party. My main course, Ahi tuna absolutely awesome. From dinner, drinks To signature butter cake desert an over the top experience you won't want to miss."}
{"text":"This place is the best for fish.

Get the tuna, and get it raw, or close to it.

Lobster mashed potatoes are superb, probably has a whole lobster in an order. At almost $40, it's not a cheap side, but worth it and more than enough to share with a few people.

Service is always great.

Mastro's is obviously not cheap, but if I'm going to spend that much for dinner, this is the only place I know that still consistently over-delivers at that price."}
{"text":"We had heard so many good things about Ocean Club, read the reviews, saw the prices and had high expectations. Made our reservations 2 months in advance for our 23rd wedding anniversary. Unfortunately fell way short of expectations. The year before we went to Mastro's City Hall for our anniversary. We ordered the Lobster Cocktail (for the first time) and was blown away by the potion size and quality. When we arrived at Ocean Club we saw that is was on the menu so we eagerly ordered it again. Truly disappointed. Small portions and extremely tough and chewy. We've never experienced lobster that way before. Moving to the main course my wife ordered the Lemon Sole and I had the Mahi. Lemon Sole was black on the bottom and mushy. We showed it to our waiter who agreed that was unacceptable. Sent it back and we split the Mahi which was good. Unfortunately our disappointment didn't stop there. We had read so much about how delicious the Lobster Mash Potatoes only to find the lobster suffered from the same chewiness as the Lobster Cocktail.

Overall not a good experience, wouldn't recommend, won't be returning. There are several better seafood options out there that consistently meet expectations."}
{"text":"Same as the Newport beach ocean club. Very tasty bone in rib eye however too pricey for what it was. Great place to take a date if you are willing to shell out some hundy's."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. Probably the best meal I have eaten in Vegas in years.
It was my husband's birthday so I made reservations. I wasn't that impressed with the venue, almost like a food court in Crystals, City Center. But the service and attention from the moment we arrived more than made us feel special.
We had crab cakes, mussels, filet and lobster mashed potatoes. Super heated plates, everything cooked to perfection. We shared everything and had more than enough food for two. Oh and a couple of bottles of wine. The prices were not silly! I had mentioned on the reservation that it was a birthday and an absolutely phenomenal dessert was brought to the table with no prompt from me. The manager personally visited the table and left a card.
The following morning I received a call asking how we enjoyed ourselves. Who does that?? Perfect attention to detail."}
{"text":"Lovely place. Their seafood and steaks are definitely the best in town. If you are looking for a wonderful meal experience in a high class open social environment, visit this place!"}
{"text":"You can do a lot of interesting things in Vegas.  I had no idea fine dining in a funky abstract treehouse was one of them.  Mastro's is quite the experience -- from the structure itself, to the wondrous items and their presentations, to the exceptional and classy staff.  You salivate as you picture-perfect dishes being carried by.  

The seafood tower is a spectacle - double tiered dish with dry ice smoke surrounding it.  I have no idea how the waitstaff can carry that giant concoction.  It came to the table and shocked us at first sight.  The shrimp were the size of my fist, the crab legs were monstrous, and everything was overwhelming.  If you can eat after that appetizer, then hats off to you!  

As luck would have it, I was crazy hungry, so I went for the 22 oz Bone-in Ribeye.  It came out on a plate sizzling at 400 degrees.  Perfection!  Medium rare to the T.  That was the second best Ribeye I've ever had (first being V&A).  I wanted to pick up the bone and start gnawing.  

Someone else got the Halibut cheek which also looked very unique and delicious.  I really wanted to order it.  Alas, as a Texan, Ribeyes speak to my heart (on so many levels?)  

This is definitely one of classiest places that I've been to.  What an upscale Vegas experience."}
{"text":"Mastro's is our favorite  dining spot. Whenever we  can try a new location, we make every attempt. This Mastro's did not disappoint.  Oddly enough this one is placed in the center of a super high end mall. The restaurants construction is a work of art! 

The misses had the scallops and I had the crusted sea bass. Sides were Brussels sprouts and scallop potatoes. 

Dessert was non other than the butter cake.

Water was great! We had a primary waiter but everyone there is quick to help. 

We will be back at this one for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday evening to celebrate my 30th birthday. Had really high hopes as I haven't dined here before. When we arrived, they couldn't find my boyfriends reservation, although we have the email confirmation and the the notes he wrote that said it was my 30th birthday. They sat us anyway, without asking or engaging with us and we were seated by what I assume would be a manager. Anyhow, they sat us next two family with their kids running up and off the booths. When there were other tables not in between two families. We ordered the bone marrow and lobster bisque to start, both were great. We shared the tomahawk and truffle king crab gnocchi and mushrooms. All great, steak was pretty fatty but it was still good. Dessert we had the butter cake, I was expecting a candle or something since it was my birthday and I forgot they messed up on the reservation. So they had no clue it was my birthday. Overall completely disappointed in a very expensive dining experience."}
{"text":"It has been a bit since I have been here. After the steak we had I question why- except I know the answer. Bone in rib eye- wow. The lobster appetizer was a lil skinny on the lobster- to be expected in a steakhouse- its not the main order, right? Sides and service, great. Mmm u are still in a high end mall. This has nothing to do with food or service, but its like, really? Patrons , please understand that a t- shirt or a jean jacket is acceptable for evening attire. I get it is Vegas, lunch-ok. Dinner? Puh-leez"}
{"text":"Scottsdale Ocean Club never disappoints. Whether entertaining clients, or family and friends..everyone is sure to leave happy. The food is perfection and the service is immaculate. Also, the area has great surrounding shopping. OC is located in Keirland and across the street is the quarter. 

AND PLEASE TRY THE BUTTER CAKE."}
{"text":"I had major food coma and forgot what i was going to write. I'll update this when i do wake up. Service is def top notch."}
{"text":"Updated 8/3/2013.

A couple weeks ago, I wrote the updated review below wherein I was contacted by the manager of Mastro's Ocean Club. He said he would either take our three entrees off our tab or send us a gift certificate (for the price of the three entrees). I asked him which would be easier for him and he said the gift certificate. I got the gift certificate last week...it was for $100...not even close to covering the cost of our entrees. My lobster, for example was $70...that would mean the other two entrees totaled would have had to have been $30 and we all know that the scallops and the bone-in ribeye would be more than $30 each.

I am really upset. I wish I would have told the manager to have the price of the entrees removed from our bill even though it would have taken him longer to do it. Believe me, we won't be using the gift certificate anytime soon, as we are very disappointed in this whole matter. And if the manager is reading this and wondering why I didn't call him...it's like this. You didn't comp us for the price of our entrees like you said you would, and if you can't abide by your word, why should I bother calling? I'm sure you'll just have some flimsy excuse why you did what you did.

I'm thoroughly disgusted with Mastro's Ocean Club...no longer a fan.

*****
The other day after I posted my review on Mastro's Ocean Club, I was contacted by their parent corporation asking me to complete a survey and note my remarks. Yesterday, the manager of Ocean Club called me to discuss my remarks. He was very pleasant and we discussed at some length the issues I had described. He provided a very nice resolution to the whole ordeal which I thought was very nice. Needless to say, I'll be giving Ocean Club another chance and look forward to making the acquaintance of the manager.

One other positive note: after enjoying the Blufeld Reisling on my visit to the restaurant, I have been able to find the wine in the Valley. After a discussion with AJ's, they explained to me the differences in the Reidl stemware created for various wines and I now have four beautiful pieces of stemware to compliment my Blufeld. Next time I will remember to note the name of my waiter, so I can give him the praise he so richly deserves for recommending this wine."}
{"text":"We went there for my cousins birthday. It was everything I was expecting it to be. The food was amazing, the service was great, they even brought out her favorite cake for desert all decorated!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here with our friend's who were visiting from Australia. I love coming here because it is always consistent. Many of us ordered wine and cocktails. You always feel special when you get your own shaker for your martini. We shared the tomahawk steak, which is amazing. We ordered brussel sprouts (amazing), gorgonzola mac and cheese ( just so so, I like my pasta softer), sweet potato fries (no flavor, not sure I like the tempura batter), and scalloped potatoes (yum!). Service is always amazing. Thank you Mastros!"}
{"text":"As expected, the food and level of service were remarkably top notch. The martini drinks were huge, shaken in a full size shaker, giving you two full servings. The Oysters Rockefeller and jumbo shrimp cocktail were delicious. The special \"Tomahawk Australian Wagyu beef\" was tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned, grilled to perfection medium rare! The Twin lobster tails were lightly steamed, preserving their delicate texture and softness! Tasty Garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were the perfect complement to the proteins. We mentioned that we were sharing everything, so the chef pre-sliced the beef and lobster, upon suggestion, to my liking! So high end, so pricey and so worth it!"}
{"text":"I liked this place, but I think it's more for the atmosphere than the food.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good - it just didn't quite live up to what I was expecting.  We ordered the seafood tower and everything was delicious.  For my entree, I ordered the petite filet.  While good, it definitely could have been seasoned more and was a bit overcooked.  Honestly, I think Kevin Rathbun Steak has ruined  every other steak restaurant for me - nothing will ever to compare to the steak I had there.  As a side, we ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese, which had far more mac than cheese unfortunately.  I could barely taste the gorgonzola at all, and given it's strong flavor, there had to be practically none in there.

Drinks were top notch and the service was excellent.  We sat in the treehouse, which was very cool, but the food just didn't do it for me.  Unfortunately, it just didn't live up to my lofty expectations."}
{"text":"I've been to Mastro's in Chicago and I had a wonderful dining experience and that is what made me look forward to the dinner in Vegas.

Let me start off by saying that the food was excellent. We all went there hungry and were stuffed when we left. 

We were, however, extremely disappointed by the service we received. It took away from the whole experience. It was about 15 minutes after we were seated to get a waiter to us for a drink order. The restaurant was not even that busy, which made it more frustrating. It took another 20 minutes or so after we got our drinks to put in our food orders, even though we told our server we were ready to order when he brought our drinks.  A number of the party has been in the service industry and that may have made us extra critical of the evening. 

Our actual meals came out quicker than it took to get them to our waiter. Then when we were super full and ready for our check, we had to flag down someone who was not even our server to get it because our server had been out of sight since he brought our food. 

For what I paid for my meal, I was extremely disappointed by the service. I will say that my steak was cooked to perfection and our sides were exquisite. It's a shame that that was overshadowed by the service we received."}
{"text":"Loved the bread, filet, tuna, and mushrooms! Happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not impressed!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent seafood spot in Vegas! I loved the atmosphere/ambiance more than anything so I would highly recommend coming for a special occasion. But remember to make a reservation as they can get pretty crazy packed. 

We wanted to try to crab cocktail but they ran out, so we got the shrimp cocktail instead. Those giant shrimps were delicious! For entree, I tried the Chilean Sea Bass and got it pan seared, which I really enjoyed. We also got the bone-in ribeye (huge portion) that was cooked perfectly and was super juicy. We shared the buttery lobster mashed potato and was one of the best mashed potatoes I've ever tried. They sure don't skimp out on the lobsters they put in there. The portion of the mashed potato (a side dish) was pretty big so I would recommend sharing that with 3-4 people. But as far as my favorite thing from Mastro's, I still crave it everyday - would be their warm butter cake (also extremely huge so you can share with 3-4 people). I don't think I ever had anything like that, it tasted exactly like the name, warm and buttery, topped with fresh strawberries and their house made whipped cream. I know it sounds plain and simple but trust me, try it!! 

I cannot wait to be back, mainly because of their warm butter cake but also excited to try their other seafood options!"}
{"text":"We ate here before seeing a show in Vegas.  We were looking for good steak, and couldn't get reservations at our top pick, so tried this place instead.  The weird thing about this restaurant is that it's in a mall -- it's a very nice mall, but it's still a mall.  Setting that aside, the food is very good.  We all got filets and they were delicious.  The sides are HUGE, so no need to go overboard on them.  If you can, ask to sit in the \"treehouse\" -- it's a part of the restaurant that juts out over the second floor of the mall, and gives you a \"view\" of the \"mall\" (I know that sounds silly, but it's pretty cool)."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying we're here for the architecture. As such, it's a 5 star \"Treehouse\" experience in a magnificently creative space. I felt like we were dining in a modern interpretation of a Jack and the Beanstalk tree house above Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Enough imagery, onward to the food review.

The sea bass was amazing, the cod was very good; but the blackened halibuts were overdone (even the one we had specified medium rare). We also had crab cakes, a lobster bisque, and a salad - all done very well. Sides of creamed spinach and mushrooms were also on cue.

As such,  we made no mention of the less than perfect preparation of the halibut. Yet, a dessert arrived at the conclusion of our dinners, compliments of the house, as if the chef could read our minds. Maybe this is the real Superman's Fortress of Solitude!"}
{"text":"I really don't get what the hype is. My husband went here with his friends on his bachelor party and said it was sooo good so he had to take me. I don't know if when I went, I just got the wrong thing or what, but I got the ribeye steak and it was just average. It was not as good as some of the steak I've had in the past and it was very heavy. I have heard the bone in filet mignon is very good but have not been able to try it yet. The sides are okay as well. It's a very roudy restaurant and the ambience is not that great because it kind of floats atop a shopping area. It was not as good as everyone had been raving about."}
{"text":"I have to say the best dinner we had in the week we stayed in Vegas.
THe food and service were the best
Have to get a cosmo they service with dry ice, it is an experience.
Waiter Paul was the best could not do enough for us

have to try the Lobster mash potatoes"}
{"text":"Went here for Christmas dinner, very disappointed. Food was not good. Vanilla battered shrimp were outrageously huge (3x the size of jumbo shrimp, might want to note that on the menu) and too thick and chewy for me. I ordered my 8oz filet medium well; the waiter confirmed it would be lightly pink in the center, and it came out charred, crunchy and bone dry. Absolutely terrible.  A proper steakhouse always asks you if the steak was cooked to your liking; my waiter never asked me. 

My girlfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass, also overcooked, and she pushed it aside after a few bites.  This place specializes in steak and seafood?  What a joke. Any high class restaurant in Vegas blows this place away, I've eaten at almost all of them. Of all the restaurants in the $100 per person class, I'd rate Mastro's dead last. 

Service was good, albeit a little slow. The bright spots of our meal were the pretzel bread and chocolate pudding cake, they were delicious. Dining in the birdhouse was nice, but not worth the terrible food."}
{"text":"LOVED the seafood tower! My husband is a HUGE filet guy and he LOVED the bone in filet!  We got really dressed up and did a fancy date night and this place was absolutely great for it! Energy is great, food is amazing and the dessert is die for.. must try buttermilk cake!!! Our server Jared (I think) was also very very nice and fun!"}
{"text":"Hmm.   We always eat at Mastro's wherever possible.   We had really slow service (at 6p?!) and couldn't have dessert bc it took so long for meal that we were about to miss our 8p show.  Our server wasn't that busy and we had already ordered drinks...so don't know why there was such a lag.  It was somewhat annoying, as we love their desserts.  

The shrimp cocktail and jalapeño sashimi were outstanding.   Actually, the sashimi was better than similar dish at Nobu that we always order.   Crab cake was good.   We also had filet, crab legs and scallops.    All good.  Sides were average and actually didn't really enjoy the Brussel sprouts.   

Still 4 stars but for an $$$$ dinner--should've been 5."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!!! The food was to die for. I highly recommend me this restaurant. Anytime your in Vegas this spot is a must."}
{"text":"Visited for my wife's birthday. Everything was top notch from the hostess to wait staff.   If you have elevated cholesterol skip the lobster mashed potatoes however, wow! Seafood was on point and the desserts are worth every penny. The restaurant is expensive but as the adage says, you get what you pay for. We loved the entire experience. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Saturday 6pm reservation for 5 before a show. 
Neat sculpture overhead and high end shops all around us in the Crystals mall. 

People don't know what to wear. Mix of little black dresses, spandex, sport coats n jeans. 

Couple rounds of cocktails which are fast n strong. Bread was great as described on yelp.  Service was spot on. Lots of people refilling water n clearing plates. 
Start with vanilla shrimp, calamari n tuna tartar.  Nothing spectacular but not my choices. 
Ordered spinach salad n 8 oz filet medium. It's a little too rare for me but good. 3 other steaks, but wife orders some fish that flew in on our plane with us. I'm not sure why you come from the gulf to the desert n order fish.  I guess nothing is local in Vegas but snake. 
Sides were cream spinach (not as good as mine), Brussel sprouts (excellent) and gnocchi which was amazing. Add 4 wines by the glass. 
 
We were tempted with butter cake but held off. 
$633 before tip."}
{"text":"If I were a rich old guy, I'd eat here every night. 

I'd appreciate the lively atmosphere that's just modern enough to be cool but still masculine and clubby enough to remind me of my favorite steakhouse, and the service that makes me feel like a king. 

I'd love the top-notch, expertly prepared fish and steaks, the ginormous portions, and the way they make everything -- including lettuce leaves -- deliciously heart-attack rich. 

I'd amuse myself with the many ways I could drop coin here, including $4000 bottles of wine and behemoth seafood towers that require my waiter to shine his flashlight on them so that I can see my food because the dry ice is clouding my vision. 

But alas, I'm most definitely NOT a rich old guy, so I'll have to shelve this place for super special occasions such as...well...impressing a rich old guy."}
{"text":"Great service!
I love their complimentary bread basket. It has about 4 or 5 kinds of bread in it and all of them are so good. Especially their pretzel!
Their steak? Awesome. Thick, juicy and tender.
Escargot....hmm not my plate. 
Scallop is good. 
Lamb chop. Best one I've ever had!!!!!! it's a must have. 
They also gave us a slice of chocolate cake for my sisters birthday, which was awesome. 

We paid around/0ver $350 for 3 people. So it is very pricey! but it's worth the great food and experience. 
I would totally come back!!!"}
{"text":"Best Steakhouse hands down! Lobster Bisque and the Lobster mashed potatoes are a few to name the best ever! Filets to die for! Always a treat! Love you Mastros!"}
{"text":"The waiter was engaging and described all the extra non menu items with excitement. Just listening to him made your mouth water. We ordered the Scallops which were large and served in an amazing sauce. For an entree we did the rib eye which was also excellent cooked to perfection paired with the wild mushrooms that come with truffle butter melting on too. Great live music going on. A place to be"}
{"text":"We went there for an anniversary dinner on 1/19/11. After reading reviews, we were really stoked to try this place. My first stop was to the ladies room, where an attendant first of all wiped down the sink area and turned the faucet on and off for me. Okay, I could deal with that and the towel she handed me. Though I did think that having a cash basket placed halfway over the towel drop was a little heavy handed. After dining there, this seems extremely pretentious . . . very few high caliber restaurants (including Chicago's Alinea, SF Ritz Carlton, etc.) do this any more.

 First of all, forget any romantic ambiance - could barely talk to each other as it was very loud. Our waiter was very professional and saved this place from a single star.

For starters, I had the Mongo salad which to my taste for spicey foods was nicely flavored, but overly dressed; the husband unit had the calamari which was nothing special other than a HUGE starter with rather pedestrian rounds and lacked the authentic quality of true calamari fritti (such as Kuleto's in SF). BTW, everything we observed was on the HUGE side, leaving us who are somewhat disdainful of being wasteful at odds with our conscience. There is no way that we could begin to finish the portion sizes that came out of the kitchen. At the table next to us, the woman exclaimed, \"OMG, if I had known it would be this large, I would have asked to share it!!\" as someone else at the table had ordered the same thing.She ate maybe a third of her entree.

For our main course, I had the Chilean Sea Bass and there are no complaints here. It was wonderful. Husband had the Vanilla Battered Sole which arrived in Long John Silver style, HUGE five pieces, which he returned to the kitchen as he deemed it inedible. We opted to share the much raved-about Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Again, HUGE and swimming in butter. We ate maybe a quarter of the order.

All of the wine that we ordered by the glass, was very generous in portion, and we have no complaint there. Since it was our anniversary, they gave us a HUGE slice of chocolate cake with a candle . . . nice touch.

Unless you are in for a real pig out, a linebacker, or bulimic, I can't recommend this place. We've eaten at some of the best in the world, and this doesn't cut the mustard by a long shot. The bill was not extraordinarily expensive . . . but give us quality over quantity ANY day."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad I can say about this place and my experience there. I could complain that it was too expensive, but I knew that going in. The steak was fantastic and the sides as well. 

The service was great. The waiter gave us great recommendations and shared a few jokes that I am sure he uses all the time. He also provide us with a good wine pairing. I was lucky enough to have someone else pay for the bill so all the better.

One thing I would say is that if you want a romantic dinner, this may not be the spot. The restaurant is in the Crystal Mall in City Center, and this place is pretty dead. I guess it will depend on the vibe you are after. I went for a buddy's impromptu wedding, so it was just 4 of us. Definitely one of the best steakhouses in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great service, great martinis, great seafood and steak. Had dinner in the treehouse. Perfect!"}
{"text":"Fun to sit in a tree house and have amazing food, drinks and great service. 
A little to much food so make sure you pace yourself and their cocktails are pretty great."}
{"text":"Everyone there made me feel welcome and part of the family. None of the smiles were fake which is important. Mario Lopez was the ultimate in gracious and professional services! The filet was cooked to flawless perfection, and now no other steak will make the cut. Thank you all for the complimentary butter cake! You made our honeymoon an incredible treat!"}
{"text":"Best spot ever!!  Seafood towers and the butter cream cake was to DIE!   U must order for dinner (u can share).  Suggest making reservations for the tree house"}
{"text":"Good food and service no doubt but quite a bit overpriced.  A seafood tower and a few apps were a huge bill.  A greygoose martini and a house chard was $34.  Wow.  Good valet service and water to go was a nice ending touch.  Parking is a joke so expect to valet.  The place is packed which adds to the scene but this place is a little too \"Scottsdale\" for my taste.  Overpriced, lots of glitz and glamour, and really good but not amazing food."}
{"text":"Mastro's was the capstone in a hedonistic tour-de-force of eating and drinking, and oh what an excellent climax it was! We set up dinner reservations for 6:30 prior to a 9:45 flight that would get us the hell out of Vegas; while it wasn't the best idea in terms of timing, we were just super eager to eat at Mastro's and couldn't cram it in earlier in the trip.

We were seated in the middle of the big floating wooden structure, which was excellent for the view and being in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the restaurant (something I really like). Our waiter was excellent; he made us feel at ease and happily answered all our questions about ordering.

The first order of business? A nice bottle of wine. Fortunately, they had several wines in the $60 range that I like and pair nicely with both fish and meat (keeping our options open :-) ). We chose the 2009 Grgich Hills Merlot, and sat around merrily sipping until our starters came.

The Seared Albacore with Truffle (see the picture) was really damn good. I could have eaten two plates of that and been happy. The Tuna Tartare was good, but not amazing. Yep, I've dinged it for \"not being amazing\". We went in all different directions for main course: one bone-in steak, one cooked fish dish, one sashimi tuna dish. All were excellent. The sides were excellent. Everything was excellent. See a pattern?

Somewhere in the middle of the main course we ran out of wine and unconsciously ordered another! Why not go out with a bang.

The hour was winding down, our stomachs at near capacity, and fears of the implications of missing our flight creeping in, yet we got dessert. The Warm Butter cake. Dude. Best part of the meal. Might have been the best part of the weekend. Don't go without it.

Thanks Mastro's for an awesome dinner. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I've never had a bad meal here.  If you go, no matter how full, get the butter cake!!!"}
{"text":"How amazing was this place!!! So happy we got to go! A seafood tower and three lemon drops later I could easily say this is one of the best restaurants I have ever been too! 

Our waitress Sarah was amazing!  She was so attentive and answered every question I asked her about the menu! She also served me my food! We couldn't believe how awesome this place was! 

Live music at the bar! 

Can't wait to go again! Oh ps they called me this morning to thank me for dining with them! So cool!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with friends while in Vegas a couple of weeks ago. This was a wonderful evening.... Starting with the best Martini ! My steak was perfect..... This location is my fav of all the Masrtro restaurants I've eaten at. The ambience is also very inviting and cozy. Love this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has to be my favorite! My partner and I ordered the scallops as an appetizer which were done to perfection in such a flavorful and savory sauce! We also ordered the muscles but weren't too impressed with those, not enough flavor. For our entrees we ordered the 18oz bone in filet to split and oh my goodness it was the best steak I've ever had!! So tasteful and tender! We also split the two 8oz lobster tails which were to die for! Dipped in butter it was seafood heaven. For dessert we chose the butter cake and it did not disappoint! With the ice cream on top it was the ultimate ending to the dinner. Our waitress Sam was very friendly and offered great suggestions for our meal! Definitely returning!"}
{"text":"High class food in the mall.  Of course, this isn't like every mall.  You will be dining while watching shoppers hit up Gucci, Prada and other high end boutiques.  The service here is incredible.  The pretentiousness that exists at other elegant restaurants is removed while still maintaining the professional courtesies you would expect.  We ordered ala carte.  The sides are large enough for two or three to share.  The scallops and tuna were cooked to perfection.  Try the snap peas!  They are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Things are a changing.  Our reservation was 7:00.  Seated at 7:45.  Cocktails in the bar while waiting next to a table dining with 5 children.  Hmmm children in the bar with Mom working to get through with a stroller.  Not what we had in mind given we left our children at home.  Once seated the food was good but the server pressed to give good service.  Spread too thin.  Holiday fatigue?"}
{"text":"It's everything you could want / expect in fine dining (aka expensive) restaurant.

Can't really say much else that hasn't already been previously addressed. 

We dined here tonight for my mom's early birthday celebration. My sister and I split a 20 oz bone in rib eye and my mom had grilled pacific swordfish. We also ordered sides of steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes. Since it was her birthday, she got a free warm butter cake with a personal touch! 

The food was good - although there was a wee bit of over-charred areas on the steak and the butter cake was also a bit too sweet (maybe my taste buds are too sensitive now).

Overall it was a good dining experience. Would I come back..? Maybe after I've experienced other fine dining places."}
{"text":"I did not expect to find such an amazing array of steaks at a place called The Ocean Club.  I opted for the none in 12 Oz Filet Mignon and i was absolutely in heaven after the first bite.  Just an incredible dining experience from beginning to end  and the staff was very attentive to every detail.  We will be back (and next time we will make reservations)"}
{"text":"Finally made it to Mastro's Ocean Club in Vegas, as I always go the my Newport Coast location..

Consistently delicious Mastro's quality and posh interior decor. Stellar service, bomb seafood tower, A5 wagyu was LICK!!!

The chic architectural design of the spiral dome nest inside The Crystals mall makes this an uniquely edgy location. I luv that it's next to Van Cleef & Arpels, Christian Louboutin, & Fendi. Eat, then shop to the 9s to work it off...

By the time the ice cream butter cake & choclate cake circulated, I was FBR (full beyond recognition).

Our group was sooo stuffed, we shut down the restaurant and literally popped out of our dresses.

Thanks goodness I wasn't wearing one of my Herve Leger dresses, hahaha LOL."}
{"text":"Went for a celebration.  The service was pretty good--not great.  The shrimp cocktail was AMAZING!  So amazing, in fact that I decided to order the lobster tail just so I could have more shellfish.  Unforcunately, It was AWFUL.  For $87 I got a lobster tail that was so tough I could barely cut through it.  We told our waiter who did not apologize but did offer to remake.  I declined the offer but could not eat it.  Although he never apologized, the waiter did take the lobster off the bill.  We appreciated that, but left thinking that a restaurant that holds itself out as expert in seafood should have never sent out the lobster tail in that condition."}
{"text":"Wow, I've been to many steak restaurants but this one really takes the cake. We were a group of 7.
The intimate setting and fancy atmosphere made me expect a very large bill but the prices are very reasonable for the amount of luxury, excellent service, food quality, and professionalism.

Piotr was our waiter but it felt like the entire restaurant's staff was at our finger tips. We never felt like we needed to wait and it really felt like we were special guests at this establishment. I would highly recommend this place no matter your group size! I felt like they could handle anything we threw at them.

The food was amazing and all the meats just melted as we ate them. The portion sizes available were very appreciated since the group had various (stomach) sized people. Cooked to culinary perfection, we had a meal to remember for the rest of our lives.

Thank you so much."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite upscale places. I wish I could offer a review of more menu items than just the steak cuts, but I can't afford to eat here more than 1 or 2 times per year. The steak has always been perfect, and the ambiance has always been top notch. They make the best dirty martini I've ever had (ask for blue cheese stuffed olives if you're a fan of them). Very pricey, but if you can afford to splurge, try Ocean Club at least once. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go on Friday and Saturday night for seafood is Maestro's Ocean Club. I try to get there by 5:00 PM so I can eat dinner at the bar without having dinner reservations. After 5:30 the bar is very crowded and music begins at 6:30 and there is a small area next to the band where you can dance.

The bartenders at Maestro's are amazing and every drink they serve comes in a 16-oz cocktail shaker so you're basically buying two drinks.
 
For appetizers I recommend the Dungeness crab cocktail, Oysters Rockefeller,  Ahi Tuna Tartare and Lobster bisque.

For my main course I recommend the Chilean sea bass, Pacific swordfish and the Florida grouper.  Of course if you're craving a great steak you can never go wrong with the Bone-in filet, New York strip or the Rib eye. If you love mash potatoes you must try the Mastro's mashed potatoes or the Lobster mashed potatoes.

Mastro's receives a five star rating for great service and the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, great food, great service and ambiance. This is the place to take someone for a special occasion or to celebrate a big event. 

We ended up taking my Brother-in-Law to dinner for graduating Law School. I had a reservation for 7:45 and after checking in with the hostess we were seated shortly after.

Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and described their evening specials. He was assisted by another waitress that never let our beverages get below half full. You can tell that these servers take their job very seriously and want to make you feel very comfortable. They will make any exception on making you happy and satisfied.

We started off with ordering shrimp cocktails and beef carpaccio. The shrimp cocktail is accompanied with cocktail sauce and this amazing atomic horseradish. This is the kind of horseradish that will clear your sinuses and make your eyes water. I love this stuff, even though it burns it makes you come back for more. The beef carpaccio was also very good and was served with mix greens and toast.

Ocean Club also starts you off with bread basket that is filled with a variety of breads from pretzel to sourdough.

For my main entree I decided to go with the fillet Mignon cooked medium. The steak came out sizzling hot and melted in your mouth. This has got to be one of the best steaks I have ever had. My brother-in-law ordered the swordfish which he said was amazing.

We ordered a side of their lobster mashed potatoes and sauteed broccoli. The lobster mashed were loaded with lobster meat and butter......to die for. 

For dessert, I finished with my after dinner drink of choice....Sambuca and we ordered the butter cake. This cake has the perfect balance of salty and sweet and is cooked to perfection with crispy edges and a moist center. The cake is served with vanilla ice cream and a huge plate of fresh whipped cream.

Overall, this is an amazing restaurant. The service, food and ambiance is the ingredients to a perfect meal. Ocean Club is not cheap but you are paying for an amazing experience. I don't mind paying the extra money when they deliver such a great product. 

Ocean Club, you have captured another fan, I will definitely be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"Vegas.  I.  Hate.  You.  We'' make up soon.  Right now?  I.  Hate.  You.

Mastro's Ocean Club?  I love you.  No, really.  I actually LOVE you.  

So Vegas...  Why do I hate you?  I'll list the ways first.  

-McCarron's Baggage Claim is vomit bad.  
-Getting a Bungalow at Wet Republic is the most awesome idea ever.  The pain I felt the following day made me want to kick babies.
-Losing my ATM card and having $2900 in attempted cash advances happen.
-Losing a lot of money at Single Deck Black Jack on Thursday night.  You suck Caesar's dealers.

So Vegas....  Why do I still want to make up?  I'll list the ways now.

-The Bungalow at Wet Republic.  Oh to be young and dumb again.  Act like ballers and drink our faces off like money didn't matter and Donald Trump was my bitch.
-Taking the last $150 in cash I had due to losing said ATM and making 3 Card Poker my bitch for 8 hours after Wet Republic.  Baller status achieved again.
-Caesar's upgrading our room to a suite after we collectively lost tons of money.  Then won double that back.
-Finally, Mastro's

You see?  We were out there for a Bachelor Party.  Not just ANY Bachelor Party.  A Bachelor Party of Epic Proportions.  The kind you and your buddies talk about for decades.  Fourteen guys hell bent on reliving college memories from over a decade prior.  Fourteen guys that wanted to go out, make Vegas our bitch, and have the best time ever.  Almost all of this was achieved.  Except for the making Vegas our bitch part.  Vegas pimp slapped us all.  Hold me Vegas.  

Mastro's capped the trip off.  We decided to take the Bachelor to a great meal.  Mastro's rolled out the red carpet.  Complete with private room with a view.  No dancing girls.  Otherwise, it would've been a 6-star performance.  Still, overall, one of the Top 5 meals of my life.  Including my hometown Atlanta, NYC, Chicago, LA, and elsewhere?  

So what did I eat?  I know you're dying to know.  I had the Dungeness Crab Cocktail to start.  So they do this Dry Ice thing to add to the presentation.  It's cool and all.  I don't really need that stuff though.  The crab itself though?  Slap my mama good.  I remember one of my buddy's trying to grab a piece of grab and me trying to stab his hand with my fork.  Back off my crab homey or get a stump back.  

The next thing ordered was the Bone In Ribeye.  If I'm going to eat at a very nice place, I'm probably getting a slab of red meat at some point.  This didn't disappoint either.  Literally melting in my mouth while having a perfect combination of seasoning and outer char.  My buddy asked this time and I still tried to stab his hand.  

I'm not normally selfish about food I order, but when it tastes this good and all you got was Salmon and Creamed Spinach, you're simply not allowed to offer that for trade.  Idiot.  

I am not kidding about this place though.  It really was that good.  I can't remember our server's name.  He was pretty good though.  Made sure to bring the bachelor some free stuff too.  Not too shabby.  

It's probably an amazing place to bring a lady too.  Get the dungeness crab.  I'll be back.  

Vegas.  Hold me."}
{"text":"This has to be the best seafood I have had in awhile! I came with my grandma and her and I split the seafood tower. It was the perfect amount for both of us. We came on a Friday night and sat bar side. There was a band playing near the bar and it was very loud that my grandma and I could not talk/hear each other at all but the food made up for it along with the people watching."}
{"text":"Mastro's has good reviews and my honey really loves lobster bisque so we decided to give it a try. We had seen the strange bird house looking structure at Crystals many times before. We made a reservation for a table in the birdhouse although there are a lot of tables in the other sections of the restaurant. We were promptly seated and service started immediately. We ordered the vanilla battered shrimp as an appetizer. My wife ordered the lobster bisque which we shared. She ordered Parmesan crusted grouper. I ordered Blackened Chilean Sea Bass. For sides we ordered creamed spinach and sea salt and vinegar fries. My wife liked the shrimp, I was disappointed in it. It was very lightly tempura battered, very tender. I just thought it was bland. The lobster bisque was everything we had hoped for and more. It was thick and creamy with large pieces of lobster; very savory. The Parmesan crusted grouper was excellent. It was perfectly cooked and lightly spiced. The Sea Bass was perfect. It was very thick, light and flaky. The creamed spinach was excellent. The salt and vinegar fries were good. They are very thinly sliced (think potato sticks). But the best was still to come. We ordered their signature warm butter cake. OMG this may be the best cake either of us has ever eaten. It is served with a garnish of fresh fruit, a huge scoop of ice cream and fresh whipped cream. Regardless of what else you order here, you MUST try this warm butter cake. Service was excellent and she the price is fair. 

Minuses- the noise level is very high. Very hard to hold a conversation. They have a large staff of servers, but service was slow. One of our sides was delivered as we finished our entre's. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dinner in a treehouse! 

It was my first time visiting Mastro's located in the shops at Crystals.  This beautiful and elegant dining can be seen while walking through.  The 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  The wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.  

We made reservations for our group and were seated early.  I would like to give a tremendous thank you to Paul our waiter.  I don't think I've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  He went above and beyond to make our evening memorable. 

The table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. I will say their pretzel bread called my name.  I asked for more in which Paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  Fantastic! 

I started with the wedge salad.  Perfect and delicious.  The crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  For my entree I chose the Chilean Sea Bass accompanied by creamed spinach, Gorgonzola mac and cheese and Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  Of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  The sea bass was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  The gnocchi was a disappointment.  I don't think there were any crab pieces in this. But the other two sides definitely made up for it.  They were so creamy.  Anything with Gorgonzola will make me happy. Simply delicious!

If the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  On top of that list is their signature butter cake.  It's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  It's calorie free and fat free... In my dreams! It's moist and delectable.  After the huge meal, I would suggest splitting this huge cake.  

Mastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  It was surely a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"What a great spot!

We made 9 PM reservations for dinner after the Zarkana Cirque du Soleil show at the neighboring Aria.  No Vegas trip is complete without a nice dinner, and we couldn't have picked a better spot for what we were looking for that night: delicious food and wine in a classy, yet relaxed atmosphere.   Located within the Crystals shopping complex, you don't get amazing views of Strip, but the environment still exudes class and modern decor.

We had the works.  A bottle of Pinot shared among the three of us while we nibbled on the best damn bread assortment I've seen.  Two salads: Caesar and a Wedge, standard fare and did not disappoint.  And then....drumroll....the entrees!  Juicy, thick bone-in ribeyes for my two burly man-pals, who both only ate about half before conceding to the dish's fate as leftovers.  And for myself: perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, jumbo sea scallops sauteed in a rich butter sauce and served with a few Parmesan-crusted crostinis.  Crisp golden brown on the surface while tender and delicate within, the plate came with about 6 jumbo scallops, but try as I might, I couldn't finish the dish for lack of stomach space!  Wonderful side pairings of garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms to share.

Absolutely no room for dessert.  It was a fantastic meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Restaurant is beautiful and service top notch! It is on a pricey side so be prepared. But I defiantly recommend the experience. Lobster bisque was amazing and butter cake out of this world! It is big enough to share and is served with a large amount of whip cream!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!
I've never been to an Ocean Club, and everyone in my party loved this one.
Something different, their martini's are actually 2 martini's in one order for around $19, you keep your shaker which gives you the second. My staple is dirty with Chopin and blue cheese olives. Theirs was excellent!
All of the food was good, but much much bigger portions then expected - strange to me for this type of restaurant.
Didn't get desert, but the drinks and food was great. Everyone got something different and everyone love their dish.
Great place!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just finished up her birthday dinner and to say we have mixed feelings is an understatement.

Overall it is not nearly as good as Mastro's City Hall, especially concerning the service, but the food is excellent and the live music in the bar was really fun.

We had the Scallops, the Chef's Cut Ribeye, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Drinks, and Wild Mushrooms. All was really terrific. 

The service was very strange. The Managers were very kind, and seemed to help us more than our actual server did. Our server checked on our appetizer and our entrees once each, but both times before we had a single bite. We were given our appetizer pretty much when the bread was brought out, but then waited a good 30 minutes before dinner was served.

My wife was really excited about getting the Butter Cake for dessert, but the strangest occurrence of the night was that they never asked us what we wanted for dessert. After 15 minutes of just sitting and waiting, they brought us a piece of chocolate cake, so it was pretty awkward when we had to ask for what we actually wanted for dessert.

I recommend coming here for drinks and enjoying live music, but cannot recommend it as a nice dinner out when there are so many other good options in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"service was great, food was excellent and plentiful. Bring your appetite. mushrooms and of course their signature lobster mash was amazing"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was me expecting too much because all my other mastro's experiences in california were Uh-Ma-Zing, but this experience at Mastro's in Las Vegas was very much so a disappointment.  I'm with Brad T, only 3 stars.... =(

1.  Kunomoto oysters were ordered off menu and pretty fresh and tasty, but I've had better.
2.  By the time we finished our oysters, which was only a few minutes because we eat fast, we started our COLD crab cakes.  I don't know about other people's experiences, but we've always had our crab cakes kind of toasty.  Though it was crab-a-licious, I was put off by the temperature.
3.  Our 22 oz bone-in ribeye was cooked rare plus and it was delicious!  The extra sear with clarified butter is fantastic.  However, I was not pleased with the amount of connective tissue in my half of the steak.  I felt like I was prepping my own meal by having to cut through all that chewy stuff!
4.  Here's the moment of utmost disappointment.  I was thinking about my fluffy, warm and tasty butter cake all night long, and it was a butter cake fail.  It was not warm and fluffy as I remember.  It was actually almost grainy and almost cold on the outside, save the inside was warm but almost soggy.  The wonderful airy whipped cream was actually heavy and too sweet.

Conclusion:  For being open for 6 months, should I expect it to be where its other Mastro counterparts are in amazing-ness, or should I expect it to be working out its kinks and be amazing 6 more months down the line?  Regardless of kinks or not, I'm a sad puppy because other than the yummy steak mixed with connective tissue bits, everything else was just average compared to my other Mastro's experiences.  Mastro's did not rise to the occasion to it's reputation.  Will I go back?  For the love of butter cake, I will after more time has passed for this particular establishment.

[side note: If you do try this particular Mastro's, do asked to be sit in the nice atrium with the mollusk looking wooden structure and not right outside of it.  I think you will get better service.  It seems as if the table we were sitting at is a \"blind spot\".  The servers liked to walk over an peer over the railing next to you and chat about the stores and patrons below as if you weren't there.]"}
{"text":"At first glace, the menu, the photos on their website and on yelp all seemed very appealing; how could you not choose to come here after being exposed to all that? I was able to easily booked reservations with Mastro's OC the same day (on a Sunday) through yelp/open table.

After sealing the deal on this place, I had somewhat high expectations of what my experience and food was going to be like. Mastro's is located on the second floor of City Center and is surrounded by the endless amount of high end stores (Prada, Gucci, Jimmy Choo etc. etc.) so these visual cues added to my high expectations. My date and I were comfortably seated along their edge where we were able to gaze out into the nicely, holiday decorated city center as well as watch 90% of the people window shop...guess it's too expensive and not the right time of year to treat yourself to these classy brands?

Anyway, to get down to it, I was cool with the service and location but the food was OK; it wasn't to my liking and it wasn't to my disliking either.

My date ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare and it came to our table sizzling hot, at the right temperature (or so we thought) until he got down to the middle. It was not warm but not cold either...just this weird temperature that didn't seem right. At least we were able to get that replaced ASAP. 

I decided to go with 2 lobster tails--I had one regularly prepared and one vanilla battered. I should have just  had it reguarly prepared because the battered one wasn't really anything special; I didn't even taste the vanilla...or perhaps there might have been a hint of it that my taste buds were unable to pick up on. 

And the sides...geez, it was expensive and nothing extraordinary! I felt like I could have chosen the potatoes and mushrooms out myself and made the garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms myself. Actually, I think I could actually do Mastro's up in these items (not saying I'm some kind of professional chef or anything like that, just emphasizing that these items were nothing impressive). 

So after 2 ice teas, the 2 entrees and 2 sides the bill came up to about $160 without tip. I can't say the price and food quality ratio was appropriate, though again, the service was top notch. Oh and their artisan breads were delicious as well. I will also say I appreciated the follow up call they did with me the next day; I never had that happen and I thought that was nice of them to do. I guess I might come back here again but purchase something else that might tickle my fancy."}
{"text":"The staff is so excellent here they were literally falling on their own two feet to serve you. They have a dedicated water runner to notice if your water is not full and when he (in this case) noticed he ran to get water. Same applies to wine except the server was in charge of that. 

Literally have not had service so excellent before. And that's only the service. 

Let's talk about the food. You have to have to get the seafood tower. The shrimp were so large and juicy... I wanted more than just one! Good thing I ordered the ocean house salad which used the same shrimp. My mouth is watering just thinking about those amazing shrimp. 

Kumamoto Oysters available? YOU HAVE TO GET THEM. So sweet, so delicious, and no seawater/briny taste. It is something not to miss. 

For the sides, lobster mashed potatoes!! And they don't skimp on the lobster. Whole chunks of succulent, juicy lobster! Also another must get. Sauteed sugar snap peas were also super delicious. Creamed spinach was alright, not a favorite for me. 

But overall, all the sides went very well with my CHILEAN SEA BASS. Cooked to perfection: soft, tender, juicy, no fishy-ness at all. Another highly recommend. 

Top your night off with the butter cake dessert, super deccadent, but YOLO right? Workout later. :) 

I am so impressed with Mastro's Ocean Club. First rate service, even better food."}
{"text":"Went to Ocean club for dinner on our last nite in Las Vegas-had been there before and loved it. Well, this time it was even better than we remembered!  Almost as soon as you sit down, the waiter brings an amazing bread basket with the prize being the hot pretzel bread.  We split the bacon wedge blue cheese salad and my wife had the big eye tuna rare. It was a huge portion of incredible, slightly seared sashimi. I ordered the New York medium and it was perfect medium with no grizzle or fat.  It comes on a plate that is 400 degrees with clarified butter on the bottom. I can honestly say it was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Sure its $50 bucks, but I've had lots of crappy 50 dollar steaks in my life and this was worth every penny.  We ordered the side dish that the waiter suggested.-home made gnocchi with either lobster or crap meat and gorgonzola cheese. Maybe the best 29 dollars I've ever spent!  We had a great bottle of merlot and unfortunately, couldn't finish all of  the food so we passed on the amazing selection of desserts but will leave room for one next time. And no, I'm not related to the owners!  Just had a fabulous meal and want to share our experience!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a million stars, I would. This is by far my favorite restaurant of all time. You must try the Gorgonzola Mac n cheese, creamed corn and of course, the Butter Cake. I would eat here every day if I could!! It always our go to spot for holidays, birthdays and anniversaries! YUMMY! A must try!!"}
{"text":"This place has there best seafood in Las Vegas! If you can afford it I highly recoment it"}
{"text":"Overall the seafood (the main reason we went here) was well cooked and of good quality.  My wife had the scallops which were very flavorful and tender and i had the sea bass which was cooked perfectly but bland.  The service was very good and attentive but the atmosphere left much to be desired.  It was too loud and dark and for couples they have special two top tables  with one seat on a long benched wall.  I found this to be very uncomfortable and not intimate at all.  I would not go back.  Too expensive given one bland dish and poor setting."}
{"text":"Excellent ,  fun and friendly!. 
Nice tuna.  
Superb entertainment .  Piano and singer."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely wonderful. The sides are huge so don't order more than two per couple. The service is wonderful as well."}
{"text":"If you want classy, high end, and delicious food.. go to Mastro's! My husband and I LOVE Mastro's. The crab cakes (appetizer) and butter cakes (dessert) are to die for! The atmosphere is very inviting and romantic, and the servings are VERY generous. I was full after eating just bread, my appetizer, and side salad! Lol Our most recent visit was on Valentine's day evening. We were seated in the private dining area upstairs and were very pleased with the service. Our waiter was extremely friendly and informative if we had any questions regarding anything on the menu. The hostesses were VERY welcoming and easy to talk to over the phone when making reservations. Our most recent visit was fantastic! They even gave us a butter cake \"on the house\" as a thank you for visiting them on Valentine's Day (Score!). We had a wonderful experience and overall, the food, atmosphere, service, experience, etc, was all top notch! Highly recommended. 

The ONLY thing I had a problem with, was halfway through our meal, we noticed there were so many servers and waiters, some of them stood around and walked around aimlessly (WITHIN the private dining area, instead of out in the hall) because, well... I don't know.. maybe they just couldn't find anything to do because there were so many of them? It made me a bit uncomfortable as I felt I was being watched or stared at. I'm sure this was due to the fact that Valentine's day was a busy one for them, so I'm sure it's not normal. But, still.."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food. From the attentive service, tasty drinks, fresh seafood to the butter cake for dessert, everything was really good.  Swordfish perfectly done. Salmon was delicious also. Will definitely go back. Worth the cost."}
{"text":"Big pimp'n when you come here. This place is very very good!  Top notch!  You want to impress the ladies, bring them here to the O bar and enjoy some live music while you order a martini at $20 a pop. Then get the seafood tower for an appetizer, maybe a little side salad. Then order the ribeye, or the New York steak, or the sea bass.  Get the side without sautéed veggies, get them steamed or grilled. Then cash out at about $200. All worth it for sure. Oh yeah, get the butter cake. Then go to the gym the next day and diet for two weeks after."}
{"text":"Kind of a weird location in the atrium of an upscale mall, the food was terrific and service top notch. Best swordfish I've EVER had...in the middle of the desert, no less!  You won't get out of here cheap, but don't let the location deter you."}
{"text":"3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.

This restaurant is location in the middle of Crystals on the Strip.  From the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured \"treehouse\". It sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out I feel a little disappointed, because I felt like I was eating in an \"upscale\" food court with views of retail stores, such as  LV, Jimmy Choo, and Zegna.  Not exactly, the scene I expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.

However, service was impeccable, except we were only told the beef carpaccio was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  In a rush we picked tuna tartare as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the chopped salad,  king crab legs and sea bass.  

We ordered a bottle of Schramberg Blanc de Blanc for $70. Given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. The wine list is comprehensive.

I am kind of bored with tuna tartare, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  It is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.  

The mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  I just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; I like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   Definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese. 

Chopped salad was solid and I like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.

The King Crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. I was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.  

I love Chilean Sea Bass prepared any way, but I it was pan-fried to perfection.  The outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  The serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.

No room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  Very generous.

Overall, pretty good, but again I couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. We left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.

Don't know why it is called \"beach club\".  The environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a \"beach club\".  That may be a good thing, though.

Will I go again? Probably not, I think Joe's Seafood (NOT the Crab Shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed Mastro's Ocean Club many times with excellent service, knowledgeable waiters and amazing food.  Tonight we again had wonderful service and a great staff but the food was very poor. I don't know if they had a new chef or what happened in the kitchen but we had three meals and all of them were poor.   I did write the Ocean Club directly so they are aware of the problem but I believe it will be a while before we return. I hope to hear back from them that it was just something that went wrong in the kitchen tonight."}
{"text":"I must've come here a year ago with my entire family. Had to make a reservation for 8 through the Yelp system. The reservation worked, and we managed to get our same day reservation in a full house. 

Everything here was really good, the food definitely fits the ambiance and the excellent level of service. The sides, the appetizers, and the entrees are all excellent. I'm pretty sure the sides are huge as well. The only strong memory I remember from Ocean Club is my halibut entree, which is somewhat unfortunately. While the grilling was spot on, for some reason I found my fillet lacked flavor, whether that be from the fish or the lack of seasoning I have no idea.

If it weren't for being jealous of everyone else's entrees, I probably would've given Maestro's a 5 star review. It's classy and it's affordable, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best steak I have ever had. View is awesome. Service is on point and I would return. Great drinks and good vibes"}
{"text":"Best dinner ever!  Amazing food. Great service and they brought me out a piece of cake for my birthday. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went twice on our last trip and just let me say we have a new favorite steakhouse and maybe our favorite restaurant period. Everything was first class service food and atmosphere amazing. You must have the famous butter cake. My favorite dessert ever."}
{"text":"OMG delish! Gorgeous atmosphere, incredible service and from the shellfish platter to spicy Caesar salad to perfection steak we were very pleased with the whole experience! Happy Anniversary to us!"}
{"text":"Service here is exceptional, not like the Beverly Hills location. Servers are very attentive and has great personality.

I came here for dinner with the hubby the week-end before Christmas and made a reservation through opentable. We were runing late so I called Mastros to inform them of our situation, when we arrived at the restaurant the hostess said thank you for informing us that you'll be late, we reserved a nice seat by the tree house for you two. She was very nice. She even checked-in my coat.

I love the restaurant ambiance, not too loud and not as cramped as the Beverly Hills location.

I love the different bread choices.

We started our dinner with escargot, which is really good. I love the flaky bread that came with it. We ordered mac and cheese, rack of lamb and bone-in filet. This is not the best steak I've ever had but my steak was done perfectly, medium rare which I asked for. My husband loved the rack of lamb. Lamb serving was huge, he got 2 racks. Mac and cheese was ok. They didn't have porterhouse here not like the Beverly Hills location, since their specialty is seafood.

We had a great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin for my birthday last night. I have been to the Crystal Cove location (Newport beach) so I was really excited to try this one out! I was pleasantly surprised I love the dining area overlooking the mall:) the food was impeccable , the service was awesome and the drinks got me!!!! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Ah, Mastro's Ocean Club, where the entrees are delicious and the overbearing service is intrusive enough to be highly amusing. We had about four different wait staff serving our table of two with an additional three to four auxiliary members wiping away crumbs (onto the floor and therefore onto my feet), offering white or black napkins, freshening bread baskets, quizzing us about wine selections, asking about every bite of the meal, etc. I've been to some astounding and amazing restaurants the world over, and personally I prefer attentive service that is seamless and not disruptive to the meal in any way. Though polite and attentive, Mastro's was just too much effort and not a lot of panache. I felt like we were being constantly interrupted in the midst of what was otherwise a very romantic date night out on the town. 

My partner and I had the calamari, lobster bisque, chopped salad, filet mignon, salmon, a side of green beans and almonds, a side of scalloped potatoes, mixed beverages, wine and chocolate cake for dessert, so we sampled quite a lot. And, by a lot, I mean we had epic amounts of food remaining to take home. The entrees were amazing and the steak was one of the best I've had as it was seared on the outside and perfectly cooked inside. The chopped salad was over dressed and the bisque was pretty tasty. (What can I say? I lived in Boston for a long time...I'm a lobster bisque snob.) The sad part of the evening was when we got home with our food to go to find that only the cake and beans had made it home with us, delicious leftover steak and potatoes finding a home someplace else. 

So, good food, excellent steak and seafood, skip the appetizers, order something besides the chocolate cake, and make you sure check your leftovers before you head home dreaming of scalloped potatoes for breakfast."}
{"text":"Ok, so the oysters were clean, the crab was excellent, my caeser salad was ok and the scalloped potatoes were distgusting. Maybe i juat dont like them but whatever the point is this place is so boring AF.  Id only go again if it was a business trip. The band was bland too. Bye! Ocean prime is waaaaaaaay nicer"}
{"text":"All Show No Go. The huge restaurant is energetic, bustling, big rooms with nice decor and a nice music from the live piano bar.   But the food is just less flavorful than it should be for the big prices. Salad was very uninteresting similar to what you would expect at a lunch restaurant.  The recommended bone in Filet was not very well seasoned and was overcooked... maybe because it was served on a very hot plate. Grilled Asparagus was good enough. Crab legs (Because they ran out of stone crab claws at 7pm) were not that interesting and had soft rubbery outer shells.  And the service at the bar was completely disinterested and very occasional. (but they were busy pushing drinks for the entire dining room too).

It was not bad. But the food was flatter than it should have been and the service impersonal with no effort to be otherwise."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been our go-to spot every time my group is there in Scottsdale.  Food is amazing.   We are always too full by the time my main course is there.   This last time - our waiter wasn't as attentive as the last one.  The last one was a class act and just the best.  His service was just the best.    This one night, they had a live band playing and the music was great.  I almost wished we sat at the bar in the open  area to be right there.    Am looking forward to this place again!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5
Service: 5
Price: 5 (as in 5 $ signs)
Expectations: 5
Drinks: 5

Food: meh.....2?
Not 2 because of the price, but 2 because it was actually just 2 quality.

The $45 price tag for the Halibut fish stick that arrived naked on a tire-sized plate......not really helping my over all review, but the most disappointing course was the scallops swimming in a garlic-garlic-garlic-butter sauce that was so overwhelming, but still barely covered up the fishiness of the scallops.

I was in Scottsdale for 3 nights and unfortunately Mastro's OC provided the worst dinner of the 3.......and the other 2 combined still came in at almost $80 less."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dinning experience! Everything from the hostess' and LR's outstanding service! Definitely coming back. A MUST the Seafood Tower and the Butter Cake."}
{"text":"Very nice steak and seafood restaurant with impeccable service. Our waitress Sam was wonderful and did a great job selecting a wine for us.

I had a bone-in ribeye and my wife had  a baked sole dish. We shared lobster mashed potatoes, (awesome) and green beans (meh) with the couple with us and it was plenty for all of us. 

Had one of the best desserts I have ever had, butter cake... freaking awesome. Yellow cake based with butter and cream cheese and god knows what else. I promise it is better than it sounds. Comes with a big scoop of ice cream and fruit. Way more than one person could (or certainly SHOULD) eat, so share!

Great upscale dining experience in a beautiful, unique architectural setting."}
{"text":"3 couples seated under the structure in a very nice roundtable(there are few so reserve....) some other larger tables are not as nice....

Tried many plates...

To start,
Seafood tower, lobster 5/5 well cooked, shrimp 5/5, crab claws 5/5, oysters...good tower....skip the alaskan crab(here and maybe everywhere not as good imho)

Caesar salad is very, very good here 5/5

Filet mignon 4.5/5

Famous butter cake 5/5 (not always this perfectly good)

Spinach side, broccoli 5/5

Many others ordered fish....chilean sea bass again 5/5.  Others did some crazy blackening to their filet of sole...not as happy.

Hamachi sushi for starters looked good, but it comes with truffle oil(which I hate, though I know many love)

Only complaint is that our waiter seemed a little out of place for the quality of this place, one of those \"I know more about food than you because i work here...\" not recommended for dealing with some clients in this kinda of restaurant...

Overall, Highly recommended. Will come back, always do!  Nice setting, not the SW as far as luxury or people watching, but quite possibly, even better food!"}
{"text":"What a great dining experience we had last night. Our server Jamie (not sure the spelling is right)  was amazing and the staff was attentive to our every need. When we had problems deciding on our sides (because we wanted so many) he split them into smaller portions so we could order more variety. His drink selections were right on the money and exactly as described. Our appetizers and desserts were the perfect size. The food was perfectly cooked, perfectly timed and delicious.  Thanks for a great night!"}
{"text":"We dinned here for Restaurant Week and tried their Clam Chowder beautifully paired with a Rarangi by Wither Hills Sauvignon Blanc (16' Marlborough, NZ) which our server recommended. Followed with a 8oz Fillet and deliciously paired with a Argyle \"Reserve\" (14' Willamette Valley, OR), also tried the Earthquake Cab which was delicious. The sides we chose were Twice Baked Potato, Cream Spinach, and the Mushrooms. All delicious. The mushrooms weren't out of this world. Average. 
For the third course I did the Butter Cake which was very rich and creamy. I should've asked for milk lol. My friend has the Lemoncello sorbet which was perfect! I wish I would've gotten that as it was light, refreshing, and a palate cleanser after everything we ate. Do recommend this restaurant. The bar caught by attention as the bottles were categorized by color. During the weekdays there is a pianist which plays great music from the 70's and 80's."}
{"text":"Was on business and and 4 of us had a great waiter, food and the service was awesome!  I from the bay area and slightly high maintenance when eating out.  This place was superb!"}
{"text":"Mastro's has the best steaks I have had in Arizona. Their quality is outstanding and their side dishes are great as well. Seafood is excellent and I have never had something here that I don't enjoy.

The bar area has a great live band and is an awesome place to relax and enjoy a drink or dinner as well. 

The price is much higher than most places, but the experience and quality makes it well worth it."}
{"text":"First time dining. Wasn't able to get a booth or table inside the \"tree house\" dome. Booked online for our reservation. They sat us by the service station with the view of the shopping area.

Ordered seafood tower (which is ala carte price), they just put it all together. We also got Sautéed sea scallop and Japanese A5 for him. With the side dish of mashed potato and button mushroom. As well as glass of wine for each. Our server put out a dessert for a birthday. 

Decor is fancy, Very tasty dish, expensive price of course because its located at the strip so be prepared to spend about $300+ for two people.

They also offer private dining room upstairs for private/larger party."}
{"text":"I thought I was on camera. My business associates and I (3 of us) are there last night and was blown away at how overpriced for the quality and service that we received. The menu is microscopic to begin with in a dimly lit room, and so we thought we ask for suggestions. The waiter was quite quick with his response of the Chilean sea bass and with crab on top as well as the filet. Well, the  sea bass was great, but the very small portion of crab was an additional $32.00! Really? That was outrageous. Then the filet, which should melt in your mouth, was so far from that and for$58.00, was tough and terrible. Outback would have been better at this point. Then I waited 20 minutes to get my check. $350.00 for 3 people with only water as drinks.  I don't mind paying for quality and service. This place had neither yet still payed. Terrible. My bad I guess."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!! Had a 4 level seafood tower and a 40 oz Tomahawk Ribeye, cooked spot on! Our server Jayme was fantastic! Great dinner!"}
{"text":"My lovely girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Being a non-practicing Hindu, I hold a special love for a medium-rare steak. Our reservation was for 7:30PM and once we got there we were escorted to our table and seated promptly. It's a very busy place; so do reserve a table ahead of time.

Our server was very nice and professional. We ordered soups for starters, my girlfriend ordered clam chowder and I ordered the lobster bisque, both soups were delicious, especially the lobster bisque. Lobster bisque was cream and not too sweet and as an added bonus there were big piece of delicious lobster meat. 

After we were done with both soups we both ordered filet mignon. I went with 12 OZ. medium rare cut while my girlfriend went with 8 OZ. well done cut (sacrilege!!!). We also ordered creamed spinach, baked potatoes with cheese and sautéed asparagus. After a 20-25 minute wait we were served our delicious meal. The steak was exquisite, the seasoning was perfect and the meat was like butter. It melted in our mouth. The sides were also delicious, creamed spinach in particular complimented the steak well.  The only complaint of mine was that the baked potato had too much cheese on it, but everything else was amazing. 

I think this is best steak house I've been to in Las Vegas and if you are on the strip, then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Came here for cocktails after dinner at a company event.  Although I never tried the food here, I have to give this place 5 stars (would give it more if I could) for one reason: the bartenter Victor.  Victor isn't just one of the finest mixologists whose creations I have had the joy of imbibing.....he is truly an artist.  I tried the Boulevardier (which was the most well-balanced Boulevardier I have ever tried - it was actually a little bit mind-blowing.  I am good friends with one of L.A.'s top bartenders and he says the Boulevardier is one of the trickiest drinks to balance) and something called the \"Faux-jito\" which was also amazing.  I asked Victor to make me one of his original inventions, and I sadly forget the name of the drink, but it was a unique and sensational libation as well.  Next time I visit Las Vegas, I hope to find Victor again and enjoy the best cocktails in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and wonderful atmosphere but too much fat. The lobster bisque was like flavored butter and their signature lobster mashed potatoes was almost unrecognizable in the soup of flavored butter poured over the dish. 
I would have loved to taste the lobster mashed potatoes without the gravy!
My fillet was to die for and the service was stellar!"}
{"text":"World class service! Amazing staff!  impeccable attention to detail was breathtaking...I recommend Mastro's to everyone! The ambiance is amazing and the food we ordered is on the top of our list! The steak was juicy and perfect our drinks were made to perfection and the dessert was to die for! Come to Mastro's and have the same amazing experience we had!"}
{"text":"We go to Mastros at least once a year. We live in Vegas so it's a treat to have a nice dinner on the strip. The food, as always, was phenomenal. I went with seafood while my husband had steak. Our server recommended the perfect wine to pair with our food. Dan, the manager, is so friendly. And no matter what, we always save room for butter cake with homemade whip cream. Going to dine at Mastros is always a treat and we look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Purpose of the visit: our signature meal event for the weekend get away with the guys. Chose this place as an alternative to the meat temples that are typically selected and it was also close to the Aria. The atmosphere was interesting, very open and spacious overlooking parts of city cent. The birdhouse was an interesting design and seating experience. We ordered mussels, vanilla battered shrimp, sauteed sea scallops and sushi sea bass ponzu. The ponzu was excellent lightly fried and tender. Battered shrimp also was nicely flavored. Main course was blackened sea bass. Grilled sea bass was very flavorful. Sides w French fries, sautéed spinach, desert was also fantastic. Warm buttered cake was a great way to finish the meal.  Atmosphere was lively and supported by a nice two person live band that sang some nice good old rock and roll covers."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. Our food came out piping hot and perfectly cooked. The restaurant was busy (saturday night) but the service was not lacking. What made it even better was that my friend Rick paid with his winnings from gambling. No complaints here..."}
{"text":"I have eaten at he Maestros in Newport Beach many many times so I am familiar with the menu and level of service.

This location is fine but nothing memorable....just fine.

My steak was over done so a bit bummed about that and the peppercorn sauce was very generic.

Look don't get me wrong I am not putting the restaurant down but it was a 3 star experience.  That's all."}
{"text":"I read all these great reviews and I just don't get it.  I've eaten at the Beverly Hills location on several occasions and LOVED it.  I've tried on many occasions to duplicate the Tomatoes and Onions at home, but never the same.  I've been in Vegas 4 years now, and never knew that this was here until about 3 weeks ago.  It was so beautiful that i couldn't wait to try it.  Since it was my birthday, I said \"Lets go to Maestros.\"   Why am I the only person to have a bad experience here?

The waiters and bussers were waiters and bussers, no personality at all, but thats not what i went for, so no issue there.    I wanted the Tomatoes and Onions.  When the server sat the plate down, i asked \"Those are sweet onions, right?\"  He replied \"Yeah!\"  They were not. Three slices of tomato and 2 slices of a regular onion that you would put on a hamburger, burned the inside of the nose.  Calimari was very good.

We both ordered the 22 oz bone in rib eye, mine medium rare, my guest Medium, with a few sides:  Gargonzola Mac & Cheese (Pretty damn good), sauteed spinach, and Burnt Brussel Sprouts, which they were.  When they sat the plate down, the steaks looked like they were for Fred and Barney, and they tasted that old.  These were the worst steaks that I've ever had.  I sawed (literally) a piece off of each end and could not go any further. A chainsaw wouldn't help. The taste was like that of a 30 year old cow.  My asked asked \"Does yours taste like an old cow?\"  \"CLEARLY!\"  The busser asked if we wanted everything to go:  I said \"Sure, but please place this steak in a separate box\", as i intended to give it to one of the homeless people on the bridge.  When he heard us discussing how awful the meat was, busser told us that he could put it on the grill a little longer.  I told him that that wouldn't help it.  So, He boxed it up and the waiter gave us the check.  NO ONE (Manager, waiter, etc...) ever asked, from the time that the steak was sat down, \"How is it?\".  At Del Friscos, or Hugos Cellar, or descent restaurants they always say \"Please cut into the center and let us know if that is prepared correctly\", before they ever walk away.  I guess that they are tired of seeing the sawing action. After Paying, waiter said \"Till next time\" to which my guest replied \"there wont be a next time!\"

Trust me, I really wanted this to be an awesome experience, as it was my birthday, the place is BEAUTIFUL, and it took some talking to get my guest to go with me.  Check was only $250, but $130 of that was a total waste.  I could NEVER go to this place again, not even for free."}
{"text":"The concierge at the Fairmont recommended Mastro's Ocean Club for dinner. This is a fairly large restaurant and reservations are highly recommended. At 7:30pm this place was full. It's a hip, loud and cool restaurant with live music. Service was excellent with multiple people working each table. The seafood is fresh and the mussels were some of the best I have ever had. Excellent, fresh oysters and lobster were also enjoyed and shared. The main courses of different fishes and steaks were good. I do not care for restaurants were you need to buy the sides separately and then share them with the whole table. We decided on the fries and the serving was large and okay. Chocolate cake and raspberry sorbet for dessert was excellent. Overall, a very fun night with good service and food."}
{"text":"Went here for an anniversary dinner and it was amazing. Ordered the crab cakes, New York strip, pan seared seabass, lobster mashed potatoes, green beans with almonds and finally the BUTTER CAKE.

Big portions of food and very fresh. Our server was super nice and the complimentary bread had pretzel bread. 

For our anniversary they comped the butter cake which was very thoughtful and well appreciated. 

Bill came out to be 257 after taxes not including tip. A 5 star establishment!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times prior but last nights visit was disappointing.  We started with Calamari..and it was bleh.  It was well seasoned but it tasted like something you'd get at Claim Jumper (Hopefully that's not a sign since the parent company of Claim Jumper now owns Mastros...). However, our server picked up that I was less than thrilled with the calamari and graciously removed it from the bill for us.

Onto the main course. I had the 12 ounce filet, medium rare, and while it was served on a hot plate, the steak was cool and the outer half-inch was extremely rough and dry.   Again, not what I'm used to from Mastros.

The Gorgonzola mac & cheese was good and as always the warm butter cake was to die for.

Maybe we caught them on a bad night but I hope this isn't a sign of things to come since mega-chain owner Landry's acquired them in late May. 

Dominick's has been outperforming them lately."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Mastro's. We've visited other steakhouses like Flemings, Mortons, Ruth Chris, etc,  and this place ranks at the top. The servers are on point the entire meal, making sure that every detail of your meal is correct.

I ordered the 19 oz bone in filet and my wife ordered the petite filet. Both steaks were cooked exactly to our liking and did NOT need any seasoning at the table. They were flavorful as they were served. We ordered mac and cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus as our side dishes. The side dishes are large enough to share with your entire table so be aware.

We ordered the seared ahi tuna as a starter and it was delicious. Every bit of it was finished.

We ordered a few drinks with dinner and the drinks were excellent. The lemon drop I ordered was served on dry ice so the drink was smoking, entertaining presentation.

The location of this restaurant is a little odd, smack dab in the middle of a shopping mall in what appears to be a large wooden bong (not sure how else to explain it).

We also received a call the next morning thanking us for dining with them. It was expensive, but excellent and we didn't mind since we were celebrating our marriage."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Got the seafood tower and it was amazing.  Butter cake was a little sweet for me, but I'm not a sweet stuff fan, so shy away from my comment here if you DO have a sweet tooth.  

Good drinks, great ambiance - get a seat in the bar area tables and if you stick around long enough, they've got live music from time to time.  It's a great way to finish off the night!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. We surprised our daughter to a great meal for her 21st birthday, unfortunately the meal was a huge disappointment. We ordered our steaks medium plus, they came out charred on the outside and completely raw in the center. We sent the steaks back, they cooked the same steaks, that were already charred and burnt on the outside, when we received them back they were so over cooked it was like beef jerky. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted like box potatoes, runny and flavorless. 
Now, for iconic butter cake dessert! We have ordered this dessert many times before in other locations and it was always great, however the butter cake was cold and hard. 
I'm not speaking for all Mastros locations but this location was a real let down."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant but it appears to have gone somewhat down hill over the past several visits."}
{"text":"This was the first dinner on our vegas trip. My finest restaurant experience yet... ever.

We showed up around 935p after Wolfgang puck's spot close by turned us away (politely) for having just closed. I'd never heard of this chain before. 

We were sat quickly. I felt way underdressed even though the staff never made me feel uncomfortable. We ordered entrees, I had some sticker shock but it's Vegas and a nice place. I got the higher end (not waygu) new York steak 16oz medium rare and sides of asparagus and butter truffle mushrooms. 

The food was delicious. Every bite of steak and mushroom was a symphony of flavor. The plates are served piping hot and even my last bites were still hot. I finished the whole steak and half of the mushrooms and asparagus. The vegetable serving size is very very generous.

The staff was great, although the food took a little longer than we liked, and I had to remind my server not once, but twice about my drinks.

Had the house specialty cake dessert. Well worth it. Great way to finish up. I was expecting to pay about 200-240 for the whole meal, ended up a little over budget expectations but a great experience is well worth it"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to Mastros for his birthday as a surprise and both of us thoroughly enjoyed the entire evening! He said his porterhouse was one of the best steaks he ever had and we have dined all over the world. I had the Blackened Salmon and it was delicious! The only negative I have  is the scalloped potatoes were over cooked. The service and atmosphere were excellent.  The butter cake was incredible and served with ice cream and whipped cream that was phenomenal! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm a strawberry shortcake fan so my sister took me here as a belated birthday/ girls night out to try their dessert. All I can say is I was in heaven!!! Butter cake was one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had, and is plenty for 4+ people to share. Wonderful service from Elizabeth and perfect ambience. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I've dined at many a Mastro's, and I must admit: this location hooked me (and my rumbling stomach) + a pal for lunch because I found it architecturally intriguing. 

The staff in the front of the house were still very wet behind the ears. I was asked, \"Is there any special occasion that you're celebrating? Anniversary, birthday...?\" 

I replied that I am a living kidney donor and I celebrate that every day. My response didn't even register with the hostess and there wasn't any acknowledgment at all. *shrug* People have birthdays every year; it's not that often you have the privilege of donating a kidney. Just saying. 

I'm a sucker for waitstaff in white jackets; there's something very genteel about it that I absolutely adore, though the ambiance was a bit odd - the skylights above took away some of the mystery and glamour that one might otherwise enjoy over dinner. All the better to admire the lines and the strange view that our perch afforded us. 

Couldn't help but wonder: because the \"pod\" is not enclosed by walls, but mesmerizing woodwork that undulates and is breathtakingly organic... do shoppers at the nearby boutiques get distracted by the smells of the kitchen? 

\"Yes, I'd like this limited edition Dior - hold up a minute - I need me a steak! \" Surf, turf and couture - pinch me, please, and pass the pretzel bread, I'm wearing a silk shift with an empire waist - Carbonanza!!! 

The pretzel bread is otherworldly. I ignored the other varieties in the very generous bread basket, and asked for more pretzel bread, which was delivered warm, fluffy and perfectly salted. A healthy slathering of room-temperature butter didn't hurt, either. Even though I don't eat wheat, I was no match for the PB, and just surrendered to each bite of pillowy bliss. 

My virgin strawberry martini was not as tasty as the high octane version (yes, I had a sippie and was glad I did) and was just too sweet for my palate - but I had to wash all that PRETZEL BREAD down with something, right? 

Another quirk: there was a phantom lounge singer, who was, to be honest, not good at all... it was almost comical. It took me a while to figure out that it wasn't tongue-in-cheek lounge-lizardy - the dude was actually that schmaltzy. He was playing and singing live... but from an indeterminate location - I think it was behind the blue curtain - but it was just so odd, we kept laughing about it. 

My crab cocktail was okay... it was fresh and bright, but the last 1/3rd was frozen, because of the ice bath in which it sat. To their credit, when I pointed that out, a fresh one was brought out. 

The salads were nice. Nothing that knocked my Paul Smith espadrilles off, but I was very pleased that the greens were not drowning in dressing. Nice, simple, tasty. 

I plan to go again, but will make a reservation for dinner; lighting makes a difference, but then again... Pretzel Bread tastes good at any hour! 

BELIEVE."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Probably the best seafood restaurant I have ever visited."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the adorable blonde at the front desk was so sweet and welcoming. I sat at the bar to wait for the rest of my girls to arrive. While there my bartender ( Randy I believe his name was) was so nice and made my time sitting alone and waiting much more enjoyable. Our server Trista was awesome. She talked to us like friend not some table she was waiting on. She was very knowledgable and playful. Just a complete delight. The food is a little pricy but for the amount of food,great service and beautiful atmosphere you get it was worth it. I'm obsessed with the cran gnocchi ! It was one of our girls birthdays and she sent out the butter cake. Very sweet of her and yummmmmmm!"}

{"text":"This is not a very good place. It is overpriced, cheap small servings, and very salty foods. Every dish was over salted and when I complained to the manager Scott he never offered to compensate me whats so ever!
Keep the ocean... I am so disappointed.
Talk about busy and LOUD
We did however feel that our first impression was accurate, the Hostess MJ was very nice."}
{"text":"Mika, your smile and phenomenal service made my first experience at Mastro's a great experience. Thanks to you and Brandon, I'll be back here next time I'm in Vegas. The food, the service and the ambiance was perfect. Couldn't ask for a better place to celebrate our anniversary. Thank you, Mika.  You're the sweetest and the best."}
{"text":"Had a great anniversary dinner here over the weekend. The service was top notch, thank you Alan and all staff. The food was amazing. We had a 8oz filet, bone in filet, lobster mash, and mac-n-cheese sides. The meal was amazing. The food was delicious and rich, I was hungry but there was no way I could even put a dent in the sides. We ordered two specialty cocktails. The strawberry mule was one of the best drinks I've had in a long time. Thank you Mastro's for making our anniversary extra special. I hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary dinner and it was amazing! We had caviar as an appetizer, which was served with fluffy delicious blinis and all the wonderful accompaniments. My hubby had the filet mignon and he said it was very good, I had the Chilean sea bass and it was incredible! We shared a side of lobster mashed potatoes which had large chunks of lobster in them, so good!! Last but not least, you have to end your meal with their signature warm butter cake and coffee, it was the best cake I've ever had! It was all well worth the money for a such a special occasion. Their lounge is fun with live music while you wait for your table, make sure to make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!! Started with the escargot they came out dry and burnt.  ordered the New York steak, the ribeye, the Gorgonzola Mac & cheese and the sautéed mushrooms the steaks were comparable to Ruth Chris. The side dishes were bland the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese had no Gorgonzola it tasted like something that came out of a box! The mushrooms had no flavor I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"Absolute perfection. 
Shrimp cocktail that makes a grown man weep. (Really, the horseradish sauce does in fact make you weep...take caution). 
Ordered two tomahawk steaks cooked medium, with truffle butter...definitely worth the additional $15 scoop of butter...
Two grilled lobster tails...and the Gorgonzola mac n cheese was absolutely delicious. Definitely fills you up after a few bites, but most definitely worth it. Butter cake to top it all off, and you got yourself a party in your mouth. Your taste buds will thank you."}
{"text":"We leave happy every time. Seafood tower is amazing and my girlfriend loves their cosmos. Shrimp are like baby whales. Manager always touches the table every time we eat there. Everything is great"}
{"text":"Husband and I were in Vegas for a few days and we had dinner at Mastro's on our first night.  I originally booked the table for 7:30 p.m. but as we were running late, I called and asked that our time be pushed back to 8 p.m. and the lady said it should be fine.  We got there at 8 promptly and were seated at the first table by the entrance.  It has its pros & cons.  It's good in that we were sort of in our own corner but bad in that there was a lot of traffic, people walking by and the table next to us was quite loud.  Nevertheless, we enjoyed our dinner tremendously, both the food and the service.  Our server was Rob and we really want to thank him here again for his excellent and professional service.  I hope he will read this review, but if not, I hope other diners will ask for Rob as he is really awesome.  He is very sincere and does just enough to make you feel welcomed and taken care of.  The food was really awesome.  We ordered lobster cocktail, a 33 oz Australian Kobe steak to share and a side of sauteed mushrooms and a bottle of Tomey.  Everything was delicious.  We were on a bit of tight schedule as we have a show to watch at 10 p.m.  at the Mirage and Rob did everything he could to get us of out there in time for the show.  Thank you so much Rob for a wonderful dinner experience!"}
{"text":"The meal may have taken 3+ hours (we had a large group and were in no rush, but still) but man, was it fantastic.

The group started with the smoked salmon, fried calamari, and some shrimp dish (i'm allergic so I don't remember what it was exactly). The smoked salmon was delicious. Not anything special necessarily, but it sure was delicious. The fried calamari was cooked perfectly and came with such a delicious sauce, a superb aioli as opposed to the more traditional tomato sauce.

One thing the group really appreciated was that Mastro's agreed to specially make a burger for one individual who didn't want to eat steak. Of course, the individual got sick, but we were so appreciative of their willingness to accommodate us that we asked to have the burger brought out and we all shared it - cut it up into sliders. They were melt-in-your-mouth incredible. For a classy steakhouse, Mastro's sure makes an incredible burger.

I had the Chilean Sea Bass for my entree, most everyone else had steaks. Boy am I glad I went with the Sea Bass though, I was already feeling a bit full from the appetizers and then the sides on top sure was a lot of food. The fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned excellently. Flaky and fairly light actually, it was a good sized helping as well. Would definitely get again.

For sides the table all raved about the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, but I'm allergic, so I couldn't eat it. Which was fine by me because the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese was heavenly. And the portion of the side was enormous. Honestly, I could've had the mac and cheese side as my entire meal and gone home happy.

Food was great, service was as good as expected, just a wonderful meal overall. Would go back again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Ohmigosh! A true cut above the rest. From the moment that we walked in, the ambiance, the food, the staff -- everything has been perfectly designed to compliment the decor of this place. 

Two thumbs up... If I had more than two thumbs, they'd be up as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What are people smoking?!?!  4 1/2 stars!  Again, WHAT?!?!  

This place is pretty bad.  From the service to the lackluster food.  

Service wise: condescending and the dude was barely looking at me directly when I was the one addressing him.  I was def chop liver for the evening.  Until I whipped out the camera and then the plastic.  LAME.  

Food: Check the photos.  
-The Spicy Caesar looked like a free side of salad from IHOP.  'Cept it was over $10.  WTF?!?!
-Crabcakes were mushy.  Gotta have the crusty texture.  They were huge.  
-Filet had no crust and again was mushy.  Color was off too, pink on the OUTSIDE.  
-Berry bowl was MASSIVE.  Presentation sloppy just like the rest of the meal.

Great bottle prices for Pinot Noirs.  Oh the manager called me personally to thank me for my patronage the day after.  YAY.  I really don't get how this chain survives and where all the hype stems from.

I know many other restos my $250 could have been spent better.

OpenTable Bonus Point table currently.  Hooray for 1,000 pts!!!"}
{"text":"We 'popped in' on our first day in Phoenix, Saturday at 5:30 they were fully reserved including part of the lounge.  The breads and the portions are very generous! The service was impeccable, attentive and only  five star hotels in Europe could compete.  I do hope the formal dining room holds to a dress code as that is what took away from our experience, though we were in the 'lounge',  We didn't need a tv on the wall with this excellent type of service and menu.  We had tuna tartare, caesar salad (could of had more garlic and less dressing);  the tuna portions were too large for a first course. (Not complaining given the cost reflected the size. Went on to have rack of lamb and sea bass, with sides of roasted Brussels sprouts and twice baked potato. The Brussels sprouts were exceptional, the twice baked potato was nothing that couldn't be found in a 1970's steak house.  Extensive and creative drink menu. 
Left impressed with service and good food but, also a bit pinched with the cost.  They charge as high as we have ever paid and they are fully booked...what more can I say?"}
{"text":"We were able to sit in the treehouse which got us off on the right foot. Our waiter was in command...a table full of ladies...so we appreciated it. Troy made great wine and dinner recommendations.  By the end of the meal we were calling him \"Christian Grey.\" The bread basket had a nice assortment but I ended up with the pretzel bread based on another Yelp review. I ordered the salmon - blackened, lobster mashed and sauteed spinach. Salmon...close to perfection...mashed potatoes good but lobster was a little chewy. $40 mashed potatoes...wow...they were good, but not THAT good. I will admit that the side portions are definitely big enough to share (we had a table of 4). Overall the food was fresh and flavorful and the service was icing on the cake. Troy/Christian brought us out  the butter cake....SLAP YO MOMMA good!!! It looked dangerous just sitting there on the plate, but after one taste...OMG. We had to exert an insane amount of discipline not to finish it as I am sure it has about 2,000 calories.

Looking forward to trying the Mastro's in Chicago."}
{"text":"Went here for a meeting. Located in Crystals- here's a tip - go park in Crystals Valet and not Cosmopolitan. Save yourself $10!! Food is very expensive, but very good. I had salmon , the sides are family style . Of course big on pushing wine... I got a Diet Coke in a glass bottle. It was a nice experience, but not somewhere I would pay. I'd rather go to Texas Roadhouse.. which we don't have."}
{"text":"I was REALLY dissapointed.  I had heard great things and I have been wanting to go here for a really long time. We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and we made reservations a couple of weeks prior. When we got there, the hostesses were not only rude to the patrons, but also rude to each other.  They were talking back to each other, rolling their eyes and just plain unpleasant. 

The servers were great to the patrons, but we were sitting pretty close to the kitchen/bar and could hear the conversations of the servers and management and could tell that they just don't get along well. That made the experience a little bit of a downer. 

As far as the food, I was just so disappointed!!!! Talk about the biggest let down ever! We spent about $300 on everything and it was not worth it. 

First course was the Clear Lobster Rolls which were ok but we could get better sushi for less elsewhere. We also got the tuna sashimi, also good but had too many sesame seeds.  Second course was the clam chowder which was really good! The part that upset me though was when our main course arrived, I was still eating the soup, but then they took my soup away mid-bite and didn't even ask if I was still eating or not. 

Our main courses were the twin lobster tails, which were really salty. My husband got the Chilean sea bass which was pretty dry but my husband said the flavor was good, but since it was dry, it felt kind of dense. We also got the mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes. Both were delicious and seasoned well. 

All in all, we will probably never go back again. The only good thing was that they did give my husband a complimentary cake for his birthday. We enjoyed the cake and the cream that came on the side.

Average food, mediocre service for a really high price. Not good."}
{"text":"Despite my earlier dissatisfaction, we returned in early February.  Okay, the chef's a ******, but since we've always had excellent service and food, why not?
This time, bad service.  Something triggered my wife's food allergies (one reason we'd been frequent diners here was that it had always been \"safe\".)  As soon as she began to feel ill, I called to our server, explained the problem and asked for the check so we could get her to the room and get her a shot of her medication.  TWENTY MINUTES LATER he comes sauntering over and casually drops it off as if he hadn't a care in the world.  He didn't. My wife did.  I tipped shallow, and now regret having tipped at all.  Lots of other choices in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Butter cake..... is heaven. Seriously everything here is so damn good!! Atmosphere and staff is amazing as well"}
{"text":"A bite out of the ars of some heavenly bovine.  This place truly had the best meal I believe I have ever eaten.  Best as far as the entree goes (filet, mac n cheese, etc..).  However I do think the seafood appetizer though delightfully displayed, was just \"I've had better.

The service was cool, although the group I was with had built that up something fierce, and it was a bit lacking from the time they had been there before. If you really want great service, check out the Chilis in Layton, Ut.  This is not joking, that is some fine service. They will never let your drink go empty, a mistake Mastro's made."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful time at Mastro's. The food was excellent, nice ambiance, drinks were great, and the warm butter cake is ridiculous. We came back the next day to have the warm butter cake one more time before our flight home. The medium well petite filet was moist because our waiter offered to butterfly it, the bake potato was delicious, as well as the asparagus. The Blufeld Riesling was so smooth. It was a nice compliment to our meal. 

I saw people complaining about this Mastro's being in a mall. It is located in a mall but it is a high end shopping mall connected to Aria where other nice restaurants are located. I found the shape of the restaurant to be cool and it has a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Love the ambience here! The lobster mashed potatoes are amazing! The filet was cooked and seasoned to perfection! I always get the butter cake and I am never disappointed! My favorite dessert ever! Always happy with the food and service at all Mastro's I've dined at."}
{"text":"Mastro's in OC is one of my most favorite steak places ever. The Vegas one was good but I prefer the ambiance at the OC one more. The steaks were cooked well as I expected from Mastros. Lobster mashed potatoes...always yummy! Great martinis and great service here."}
{"text":"We made reservations for 7:30 pm for a return visit for our annual visit Vegas.  Last year our service was so over the top, the food so good, and the unique ambiance made it a great meal. 

It was still a great, er good meal. We arrived at 7:20 for our party of seven reservations. Both cabs got lost. 

We were seated at 8:30. The management seemed unable to deal with people camping at the table. We suggested they offer to buy them a drink at the bar l get them off their butts and get out!!  Once we were seated, we had the wonderful seafood tower. Our wait staff was good, not great (like last year). Examples is very pedestrian descriptions of the specials or main dishes. Our waiter went through the list rote. Our meals were deliverd together, but several times we had to ask for water, the bus staff made comments and interrupted conversations with their removal of plates. I think bus boys should not participate in table conversation, unless asked. 

My bone-in strip steak, ordered charred medium rare was neither, and NOBODY askede if I was satisfied with the steak, which surprised me.  My steak wasn't charred and it was rare.  I know, some people say medium rare and really want medium. I know the difference. I like 120 to 130 degrees max. My steak was rare or actually cool and uncooked in the middle. I'm in the food business and actually run a meat wholesaler. My steak was just so-so, it had some tough parts and the undercooked aspect make me leave at least 30% of the meat on the plate. 

The gnocchi and the lobster potatoes are worth the trip. 

I'm not sure how to avoid the hour wait for a table, but it was frustrating. 

Last year it was a 5 star meal, but due to average service, the long wait, my steak being undercooked and average quality, it was a 3 star night, and it was over $1,000.  Ouch."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. We went for the first time for our last pre-baby date night. I took the Yelp tips & requested we seat in the wooden \"tree house\". It is very open but intimate at the same time. We started out with the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were the size of lobster tails. They were huge. Next we ordered crab cakes which we all crab & very little binding & fillers. I took another yelpers review & we split a steak and sides so we had room for the famous butter cake. It seriously is amazing & life changing. It is expensive so this will definitely be a celebration restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to this place maybe about 3 times, and one of its sister locations in Costa Mesa about 3 times as well. Both restaurants exude that high end feeling and you will leave feeling... well feeling awesome that you spent 50 bucks on a slab of meat. But that's not all.

If you make an Open Table reservation they will always call you the day of to confirm and remind you that you are going to attend. One of the times I've been to this Mastro's Ocean Club and they were fully committed, and suggested to look for a seat at the bar area, and then one of the waitress or hostesses asked if I would mind eating on the piano (they had live music that time) which I found it hilarious, a $1k+ grand piano with me eating on it. Regardless I told her I would wait for a party at the bar to be seated but that was another time. 

You're going to pay at least $70+ per person but the food along with the service makes it all worth it. Every time I go to Mastro's, the waiters/waitresses are always so nice, helpful, professional, and willing to answer any and all questions you may have about the menu. If you haven't been there before they will let you know the vastness of the menu and how they operate as a steakhouse/ocean club.

My reccemondations as far as Mastro's Ocean Club in Las Vegas?

Bone-in Fillet
Bone-in Ribeye (although the Filet wins my money by a mile)
Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi
Lobster Mashed Potatoes
Garlic Mashed Potatoes
Ocean Club Salad
And their Raw Oysters - wherever it is from because it is super fresh

If you go in on a special occasion like a birthday or a graduation, most of the time they'll give you a slice of chocolate cake as dessert and the most kick ass whipped cream you would have ever had the chance to have. Yes it is just that good.

Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do. After writing this review, I'm just vying to go back."}
{"text":"Again 5 star! Excellent food and service. Always on point. Great atmosphere and ambiance. Can't wait to return. Had the garlic mash potatoes, 22 oz. bone in rib eye, and seared brussel sprouts. Incredible!!"}
{"text":"This was the best dinner I had in vegas. We got:

the lobster sushi roll- really tasty and light, great app
the spring mix salad (not sure on the name)- Not great... I wouldn't get it again
the sashimi tuna-AMAZING the best tuna I have ever had, and the sesame seeds added a great flavor
the gorgonzola mac and cheese- Mac and cheese with gorgonzola... do I really need to say how tasty this was?
the butter cake-super moist and sweet, good texture and flavor

Overall, I love this place. We sat in the birdnest thing, great experience and view."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Great live music. Great food. There twice baked potato was amazing. Little bit pricey but well worth it. If you are not a steak person like me they have other substatutions for seafood chicken and salad. I had the chicken breast something and it was very juicy and tender and spiced seasoning. Was well worth it. Great for anniversary dinners or birthdays. They had a huge selection of desserts at the end of you meal but I would order for 2 the portions on some of the menu can feed about 2-3 people. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING! Came here with my fiance for our Thanksgiving dinner. We had the sea bass HIGHLY recommend and the ahi crusted tuna. Loved the location and the table we sat at which was in the wooden structure. Service and staff were friendly and great!"}
{"text":"As yummy as it gets! We came to this restaurant based on reviews and we love trying all the great restaurants when we are in Vegas. Wow Mastro's did not disappoint! The lobster mashed potatoes were delightful and my filet was cooked to perfection. There was a fun band playing when we went which really added to the ambiance. It was pricey but so worth it! Oh and our waitress was truly the best! Oh and the buttercake for dessert was soooo good the real whipped cream was to die for =)"}
{"text":"I was a fan of Mastro's in Orange County and decided to try the Vegas location and didn't feel the same.

The food and service was fine but the server doubled all the items for the seafood tower which we didn't realize until towards the end and they didn't clean the crumbs on the table like other locations do.

Also, I made a mistake of only tipping 10% tip for 6 people and I was going back to give them the cash for the rest but I was too far away by that time but I saw that they changed it to 18% and charged to my card.

I wouldn't go back to this location since I found the better place the next day called \"The Palm Las Vegas\" in Caesars Palace Hotel the next day."}
{"text":"You put to much SALT on the steaks. And the sides came out cold. We spent good cash money in your place and would appreciate better food. 

The staff was very nice but in the kitchen things need to change fast. Maybe it's because of the new ownership...I don't know. Back in the day prior to the original owners selling the brand I really enjoyed the food.  

Please easy on the SALT and give more flavor to the sides."}
{"text":"Really good food and outstanding service. Everything was excellent and the atmosphere is top notch. 
i had the salmon, and it was tremendous and the side dishe was excellent."}
{"text":"I have been to Mastros in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa, this location did not disappoint. My only complaint is we were with 7 people and they offered my husbands and my sides to everybody else. We were going to share the mash potatoes and broccoli, there really was nothing left after they served them to everybody else. I felt weird and did not want to say those are mine. I barely got my side because they gave them to everybody else. Other then that everything was amazing, food was delicious."}
{"text":"Great place and location in the upscale Crystal mall.  The service was great and matched what you would expect in a high end restaurant.  The food was good but not great blow your sox off.  We had crab legs (a little dry) and halibut also overcooked and dry.  Both had an ok taste however.  The tuna jalapeno appetizer was quite tasty and the serving size was nice too.  It was a great experience but I am not sure the meal matched the price."}
{"text":"Well I have never had a bad meal here and the great steak I had recently keeps that streak alive. We had prawns the size of my hand and those were outstanding.  Blackened swordfish was in our group and it was well worth it, I can't recall how many sides we ordered but I took lots of food home. Have you ever had the butter cake? You will see God. Our server Sam was super wonderful and a delight for the eyes, she took splendid care of us. Thank you Mastro's , again."}
{"text":"Food is awesome but very pricey. This time I had the ribeye, so good and we all shared sides but what one this that was memorable is the Butter Cake, I'm not much into sweets but this is orgasmic...lol, if you have room, it's a must have. The comb of the salty, sweet, cold and hot..."}
{"text":"Amazing steak. Perfectly juicy. Delicious sides.  Professional service! Expensive as he'll but worth the money.  would be great to have their own space but other than that solid place. Also great fish entrees"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I am a huge fan of Mastros and have been to multiple locations over the country. This was the most disappointing experience I've had at a mastros. I got the 8 oz filet, garlic mashed potatoes, and Brussels sprouts. The steak and potatoes were good. The steak was not as tender as normal, which was disappointing. I also found that the Brussels sprouts were not as crispy as they should have been. They could have used a bit more time in the oven. We ended our meal with the warm butter cake, which came out cold. Disappointing....I love when the butter cake is perfectly warm with the cold ice cream. It just wasn't as amazing as it normally is! It was my first time at this location and I'm not sure I will come back. I also just didn't love the atmosphere. Mastros is normally very sultry and romantic. This location seemed to abstract and strangely, too bright. Service was great though!"}
{"text":"I am a regular here @ Mastros and I can't say enough about it!
I am from So Cal and have been to every mastros in the company besides the new New York restaurant and this one is my favorite! Whether it be for dinner to late night drinks at the bar this isa go -to for a great steakhouse with great ambiance.  The view from the tree house room is great and they aways go out of their way to accommodate you.  Plus for being i the middle of the desert, the seafood is amazing!

You won't be dissipated here."}
{"text":"18 ounce lobster tail melts in your mouth!  The butter cake for dessert is amazing.  Best service in town!"}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing to say except the service and food was great! My first time there and it's not going to be the last."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get drinks with friends or to have a special date night.  I like sitting in the bar area because it is more casual but you still get great service.  My favorite thing here are the Lobsters mash potatoes. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is superb! I've been wanting to check this place out for a while now and it just so happened one of my long time friends was planning on having her birthday dinner here. The ambiance of the restaurant is high class and lavish. Making a reservation is highly recommened, especially if you want to sit at a table in the tree house. In case you were wondering, the tree house is that giant structure across from Louis Vuitton. We had a 7pm reservation, but the birthday girl was running 10 min late. The hostesses and staff were more than accommodating and held our table. Once everyone was there we were seated right away. The waiter went over the menu and highlighted his favorites as well as what they are known for. I was torn between surf or turf, but luckily my date wanted the Chilean Sea Bass which I had my eye on, so I opted for the 18oz bone-in filet. I ordered mine rare of course because I feel anything above medium rare ruins the true flavor of the meat. The cool thing about how they serve their steak is they actually under cook it and serve it on a 400 degree plate which allows the steak to cook more to exactly how you ordered so it's absolutely perfect when you take your first bite. They age all their steaks for 3 weeks, and omg they are perfect. Juicy, full of flavor, and melt in you mouth like butter. Now for the fish, the sea bass was buttery, flakey, not too dry, not too wet, and just the right amount of oiliness. For sides, you order them seperately and they feed up to 5 which was perfect since there was so many of us. We all ordered different sides and got to share. We had brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, and truffle fries. Oh my oh my, we were all beyond stuffed. Every element of the meal was perfect, but dessert was what sealed the deal. Two words, BUTTER CAKE. If you don't think it is one of the most amazing desserts to ever exist, you need to reevaluate your life choices. They also make their own whipped cream which is euphoric. If you're looking to have a memorable dinner you need to check out Mastro's, it's totally worth the money."}
{"text":"Excellent presentation.  Food was fresh and tasty.  Elegant decor. Seated immediately at the exact time of reservation.  Waiter was very prompt and professional.  Nice place for date night or special occasion."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience. The food is spectacular and the service was on point. Perfectly cooked filet. Delicious sides especially the cream corn. Albacore had a little too much soy sauce on top. 

Overall really enjoyed Mastro's"}
{"text":"We dined here with a group from my SO's work and it was fabulous!  The seafood tower was awesome and so were the steaks!  We had a great time and will likely dine here next year as well."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here! This is one of the hot spots in LV. It's right in the middle of an upscale mall and has a nice buzz  to their energy level. The food is really on point but know ahead of time, everything is a la carte. I ordered the filet mignon which was prepared medium-rare. It was pink in the center, tender, tasty and really filling. Our group ordered an individual plate and then we shared the sides we ordered. No quality was spared by the chefs and we indulged like kings! 

It's on the higher end of the price range but it will make your trip to Las Vegas memorable and delightful."}
{"text":"I'm no stranger to Mastro's.  I have spent many a special occasion at the one in Costa Mesa.  This is now my local Mastro's for the time being, so my boyfriend and I decided to have a nice Valentine's Day dinner at Crystals.

All-in-all, as with the other Mastro's, the food and service are top-notch.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and patient; other waiters provided the same level of attention to us even though they weren't assigned to our table.  Like always, we shared a 22oz ribeye, and a side order of Alaskan king crab gnocchi with black truffle.  We grabbed a second order to-go because we love that dish that much.  For Valentine's Day, we also got a complimentary order of Mastro's signature warm butter cake, which is incredibly sweet and rich.  Love it.

My only complaint is the atmosphere of this location.  The main dining room is located in an open-air treehouse structure inside the Crystals mall.  Although for Valentine's Day we were seated in one of the private dining rooms upstairs, I would imagine the atmosphere between the two is similar.  I dig the dimly lit, quiet, romantic ambience of the Costa Mesa steakhouse.  Since this location is in a mall and (mostly) open-air, you get ... a mall atmosphere.  Which is okay, but not optimal.  There also seemed to be a lot of very loud, drunk people at the restaurant, but I figure they're everywhere on the strip on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Mastro's is a very good steak and seafood restaurant in the Crystal's shopping mall next to Aria on the second floor. 
It's best to make reservations ahead of time or you wait. 
Service was prompt and courteous. I enjoyed a delicate Malbec (it doesn't give me migraine headaches like other wines do). My husband and I split a Wedge salad that was perfectly mixed with blue cheese, cheddar cheese, bacon and onions. My husband really enjoyed the bone-in ribeye and I couldn't finish the delicious Artic Char I was served. The double baked potato was gargantuan and awesomely scrumptious, but the best part was ordering creme brulee' and to be served a giant wallop of real whipped cream bigger than the dessert portion!  Simply delightful."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend who lives in Las Vegas. We were celebrating a birthday. The ambiance and the service were just starters to a terrific meal. Our waiter was helpful with suggestions and the other waitstaff was BOMB!  When our appetizers arrived ( calamari, and dungeoness crab cocktail was oh so good. Dinner was delicious. We had the blackened halibut x3 and the other person had the lobster tail. Our sides were   Sautéed broccoli, lobster mash, sautéed asparagus , all were top notch. FABULOUS!!!  The service alone was 5 star. And the food was another 5 star.   We'll be back. Yes it's pricey, but who cares!!"}
{"text":"I went to Mastro's for a business dinner for the first time earlier this month, and definitely plan on going back again if the opportunity arises.

The staff, from the hostess to our waiter, were very friendly, and our waiter was very knowledgable on the menu, chef preparation recommendations and specials. He also didn't hover too much, which is appreciated. 

Our table started with calamari and an order of one of the day's selected oysters. The calamari was incredibly tender, the oysters were excellent too - the delicate cucumber flavor was exactly as described by our waiter.

For our main course, I had the arctic char oreganata (prepared with seasoned breadcrumbs) and my companions had the special wagyu and Chilean sea bass. For sides, we split the gorgonzola mac & cheese, sauteed asparagus and creamed corn. 

I'm deducted one star for the slightly underseasoned sides and for the ridiculously large portion sizes. My arctic char, while delicious, was enough for three meals (no, seriously, it was a pound of fish), and the sides were also much larger than you would expect at a restaurant in this price range, which can significantly limit the variety of sides you can try if you're dining in a party of 5 or less."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and my second experience was even better than the first.  My hubby and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were so glad we did.  

We were greeted by the sweetest hostess as soon as we arrived, and she asked if we were here for a special occasion.  I let her know that it was our anniversary, and word traveled fast since our waiter greeted us with a congratulations.  

I ordered the petite filet (8oz) and a side of Brussels sprouts, and my husband ordered the Bone-In Filet (12oz) and the Gorgonzola mac & cheese.  My steak was so tender that I could cut it with a butter knife and it practically melted in my mouth.  My husband is a steak connoisseur and he said that it was the best steak that he's ever had.  The Brussels sprouts were buttery and pan seared to perfection, and the mac & cheese was rich and heavy.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese at all but the Gorgonzola was really mild (I guess they use 4 kinds of cheeses).  

Although we didn't even have room for dessert, our waiter brought us a nice piece of chocolate cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate.  Along with this came a giant serving of their homemade  whip cream.  I somehow found room in my belly and managed to scarf down 1/2 of it.  A really nice gesture that went a long way.  

The service was fantastic.  Even if we looked in the waiter/servers' direction they would come over to see if we needed anything.  

The only thing odd about this location is that it is in the Crystal Cove mall, so the ambiance isn't what I'm used to with this kind of food.  At least we were surrounded by high end shops like Jimmy Choo.  The bathrooms are also upstairs which are kind of a bummer.  We didn't mind at all though, we were on cloud 9 with everything else about the place."}
{"text":"my fiance and i enjoyed a new years eve dinner here.
great food as usual -- we usually frequent the mastros ocean club in newport beach.

service is unparalled, food is incredible, always a wonderful time here!"}
{"text":"Ordered the australian ragu, lobster mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, creamy spinach, brussel sprouts, and vanilla baked lobster. All extremely delicious and great service. The australian ragout is 33 oz, I shared with a friend and it was more than enough. Another friend got the new york ragout which is also delicious but very, and i mean VERY fatty but just as tender and juicy. Depending on your taste, I preferred the australian ragout."}
{"text":"My sister and I tried the truffle gnocchi and thought we died and went to heaven that night; it was that outstanding! The service was excellent, and it wasn't too loud in the restaurant. The only slight downsides were the fact that it's a little dark in the space and the seating is somewhat tight, but certainly don't let that deter you from coming here, b/c it's wonderful!"}
{"text":"Good service. Ok food. Expensive.

Went here on expense account with group of 12. Love the look of the wooden structure but we were seated outside of it so it was more like eating in the aria mall (which is also beautiful but not as distinctive). Very good bread. Mixed seafood appetizer was nice, with all the classic things you would expect like lobster and prawns prepared adequately. Jalapeño sashimi was also added and was great. Cocktails well prepared but not imaginative. 

For dinner I had sea bass which was overcooked. When you order any of the fish, they ask if you want it pan seared or encrusted. Therefore there is nothing imaginative about any of the fish entrees. It's just a piece of fish on a plate. I think this approach can work for steak, but I'd really rather the chef put some effort into a creative method and flavor for each fish on the menu.  Sides were good but nothing noteworthy.

Overall par for the course for Vegas. Unjustifiably expensive food with service that is excellent but also a little pushy, so you end up with more food than you want to eat. Very beautiful venue. None of the food or cocktails stood out."}
{"text":"Like Mastro's City Hall, always great food and service! 
Similar menu as City Hall just more emphasis on seafood. If it makes a difference to anyone, I find that City Hall draws a slightly younger crowd (30's) than Ocean Club.

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate me and my husbands Birthdays. Started with shrimp cocktail and foie gras. The shrimp were huge!! Foie Gras was divine and came with toasted bread, chutney, and greens. For dinner had filet and ribeye, lobster mashed potatoes, and wild truffle mushrooms. We left so stuffed!!! The food was not over salted and cooked perfectly. Only reason why I gave 4 stars is due to the chocolate martini I ordered that tasted like Yoo-hoo."}
{"text":"I felt like we were eating in a spaceship with the extrordinary architectural design of this restaurant. Once the food started to come, you completely forgot about everything else except the STEAK.  The tomahawk steak is a gigantic rib eye with the RIB still attached and it is HUGE!  I split it with someone and still only could eat half of my half.  But that half...oh my! Tender, tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sides were decadent with the lobster mashed potatoes and the ever yummy mac and cheese.  My favorite side?  brussel sprouts! Amazing, just try them.  And for dessert, even though we couldn't eat anymore, the butter cake. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The boyfriend decided to make a dinner reservation here for my birthday. He had to keep adding people to our reservation but they were accommodating and allowed our changes.

The place is located in the middle of Crystals, the shopping center at City Center. We arrived on time for our reservation but they did not have our table ready so we grabbed some drinks at the bar. There was live piano playing and singing so it was a pleasant wait.

Dinner was good and the service was good.

I got the bone-in rib-eye and it was good. It was tender, juicy and flavorful.

Sides:
Creamed Corn
Creamed Spinach
Garlic Mashed Potatoes
Sauteed Mushrooms

All the sides were delicious. It's family style so the servers will initially go around and ask if you want a serving and will serve you.

It was an amazing birthday dinner and I would come back here if I ever get the chance."}

{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club is smack dab in the middle of the Aria City Center mall. Because of  this, the ambiance and setting is not as upscale as the one in Beverly Hills. This place has more of a casual setting to it but most people will dress in their casual Friday attire.

The food was great.. very similar to the food at Beverly Hill location but because of the Ocean Club name, they have more fresh seafood at this location.. I still think that Mastro's excels in steak so unless you don't eat beef, why would you order anything else?

Also, I recommend that you make reservations to this place. When I went, they were not busy (they had like 6 parties dining), they insisted that they were. Make sure you specifically ask to dine in the Treehouse. This is the middle part of the restaurant that overlooks the mall. Anywhere else, and you end up close to the piano, and the piano's volume can get overwhelming.

All in all, Mastro's in Vegas is a good steakhouse. But because of it's prices, I expected it to be a little more on the personal and upscale level. but the fact that it's in the mall makes it seem like they are a more casual restaurant with high prices. I personally prefer the Mastro's in Beverly Hills. If you are a local to Vegas, definitely give this place a try. All of you that did the 4 hour commute to Vegas, drive back and go to the one on Canan in the 90210."}
{"text":"Weird place.  Couldn't tell if it was a nightclub or fine dining restaurant.  Everything is a la carte and was mediocre.  Chilean Sea Bass for $51 that came on a large white plate with nothing.  Ordered some sides and a salad, again, just mediocre.  Nothing really stood out.  Service was slow and not particularly friendly, both at the table and hostess stand.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. Planned a nice dinner out for a party of eight before we caught Britney at PH. Every single thing I put in my mouth was outstanding. Yeah it's pricey, but this is quality seafood. Wine and cocktails also great. The crab cakes were some of the best ones I have ever tasted! Same with the calamari - so fresh! No one had complaints. Wanted to check out the dessert menu but had to hustle to our show unfortunately. I would love to come back next time we are in Vegas. A five star experience all around."}
{"text":"I've been to Mastro's restaurants many times before but finally got around to posting a review. Of the locations in Arizona, Ocean Club is my favorite because I'm a big fan of seafood. Plus, this one is less than 15 minutes away from our house. Service is always stellar and I believe our server was Giuseppe last night.

Came here last night with colleagues to celebrate the anniversary of establishing the company. We started our meals with some crab cakes and shrimp cocktails. The crab cakes are 2 to an order and are big enough to share. I wish I had taken pictures of the food but I didn't want to be 'that person'. One person ordered the lobster bisque, another a Caesar salad.

Our table also shared a few bottles of the Jordan Cabernet from Alexander Valley. I didn't partake in drinking last night though because I had a headache going into dinner but I do know I enjoy that wine.

For our main entrees, one person ordered the chopped salad. The others - filet mignon and the porterhouse steak. A coworker and I ordered the chilean seabass and everyone enjoyed their meals very much. I honestly can't remember what they called the preparation of my dish, but I know it had breadcrumbs on top. It was perfect. I always get chilean sea bass at steakhouses. Unfortunately, my boyfriend missed out on this meal so he wasn't there for me to pick steak off his plate (which I always do). I did get a bite of the porterhouse and it just melted in my mouth.

Side dishes that we ordered: lobster mashed potatoes (because you're a fool if you don't get it), sauteed mushrooms, creamed corn, and baked potato (it was huuuuuge). We were honestly so stuffed but we managed to have enough room for dessert. There was no debate - we got 2 butter cakes to share. The butter cake at the Mastro's restaurants are pure heaven. With a nice carmelized crusted outside and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, it only gets better when you spoon a large dollop of their whipped cream. This dessert I did get a picture of. My sweet tooth was satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the filet 12oz. Gorgonzola mac and cheese and heirloom tomato burrata! All so good!!! Steak melted like butter in my mouth! Lol! Wine (pinot noir) is great! 
Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We came for lunch & service was excellent.

First we ordered the Lobster Bisque, this was not too impressive it had 2 pieces of lobster in it. Then the Fried Calamari came & this plate was plentiful! We were surprised how much they gave us & could not finish it all. For my main dish i ordered Halibut Fish & Chips, this came with 5 small pieces of fish & the fries were too salty. My husband's main dish was Grilled Prime Burger, this burger was huge but again had salty fries."}
{"text":"This was my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!  We went 2 times.  I had the chilean sea bass and it was delicious.  Appetizer was delicious.  We also had sauteed spinach and mashed sweet potatoes and they were great.  b/f also had Chilean sea bass-blackened..and he loved it!!  The dessert is to die for...we ordered the butter cake with whipped cream and icing...OMG IT WAS DELICIOUS!! This is an upscale place so dress very nice..it also has a great bar...big bar with small tables all around it...we had drinks before  and after dinner at the bar (it was a Saturday night and it was crowded).  this is also one of the late night restaurants in the area..so i liked that!  mixed crowd all ages but a lot of 35 and over...i also noticed a lot of single men at the bar that night. I highly suggest this place!!  i also suggest making reservations."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Mastros after it was highly recommended by my boss, and listening to Mark & Brian from KLOS go on and on how great this place is.  Well, they were not joking.  Had an absolutely fabulous dinner,  We both ordered the Bone in Fillet, melted in my mouth, this was the most Delicious steak I have ever had.  Ordered the side of cream corn, which we shared, excellent once again.  The ending was the best, as it was our anniversary, Michael our waiter( he was awesome!) brought us Mastros signature butter cake, to die for!!  The service was suburb, from the hostess who sat us, to our awesome waiter.  We will definitely be back (soon I hope!)"}
{"text":"Kind of a weird experience. Food was good but not as good as last time. Good but no wow this time. Service last time was outstanding, best we have had, perfect. This time service was terrible from the main server but good not great from the support service staff. It made a big difference in the overall experience. In a place like Mastro's service matters....A LOT."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the food was pretty good.  

The service was really good throughout the entire meal as you expect from a high end restaurant. 

The steak was alright but I would recommend the seafood tower as an appetizer."}
{"text":"With an upcoming wedding we went to Mastro's to hear a band - and were seated at a highboy in the lounge within ten minutes of arrival.
What struck me was how dark it was, needing to use the server's pen-light or phone to see the menu - and the noise level such that the band could barely be heard, with conversation taking great effort. It was difficult to feel comfortable as our table was in a traffic pattern, continually passed by wait staff.
The service was extremely efficient (bordering on abrupt,) with perfect timing between plates.
The food was okay...just okay.  We ordered two appetizers (served one at a time), two lobster bisque soups (not so good,) and of course the \"claim to fame,\" warm butter cake. Portion sizes are generous so half of our food went uneaten, except the cake.  By dessert time we were full and brought it home...and yes it lives up to the hype.
All in all my experience was underwhelming.  The constant foot traffic ruined it for me.  On the other hand, I heard the band and accomplished my mission.
2.5 stars."}
{"text":"In the mall at Aria lies a bird house made of wood that serves great steak. We came here with a reservation made on Open Table for a pre-show dinner for a birthday. It's pricey but the steaks are worth it. I read the sides are massive, they were decent. Enough for 2 people in my opinion. I had the bone-in filet and it was delicious. My partner had a grilled fish and it was fresh and tasty. The sauteed spinach was full of garlicky goodness and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. The big bread basket had lots of choices and the chocolate cake was great. The service was impeccable and our waiter was very knowledgable. The only downfall is the location. It's so odd to be at a high-end restaurant in a mall, even if it is a very high-end mall."}
{"text":"Worth every penny! Everything bite was beyond delicious. Best lobster bisque I've ever had. The filet with truffle butter was perfectly cooked and tender. We added creamed spinach, lobster mashed potatoes, and asparagus all were very good, especially the lobster mash potatoes. Nothing but good things with the warm butter cake. Even if you don't have room for dessert, you have to have the warm butter cake!!!"}
{"text":"Whenever we dine here, my tummy and my brain thank me..After a disappointing dinner at the RM Seafood last sunday../for my hubby s B-day/, we decided to visit our friend..Mastro at Crystals ...I called to make a reservation and was greeted by Sarah which was super nice and helpful.My husband and i were wearing shorts and that was not a problem for the restaurant's attire.
We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir and of course the bread basket. 
For appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail /all clean,deveined properly/ and the steamed mussels..let me tell ya..the shrimps are super jumbo..i took 4bites out of one shrimp..the mussels are delicious  with that tasty wine reduction ..actually just that by itself is an entree .
For entree we shared the seared scallops and a steak with a side of fries.. The portions are perfect ..but we got full after the steamed mussels so had to take the rest 'to go' ...
Also, if u have a special occasion, make sure u tell them ahead as they will get u a super nice piece of cake for u.. ON THE HOUSE.
All this deliciousness didn't cost more than $180 .. 
Thank u for another pleasant experience Mastro's ..see you soon!"}
{"text":"To say this was the worst meal I've ever had in Vegas is an unbelievable understatement. I ordered the lobster tails and was rewarded for my choice with food poisoning.

Secondly, a table with 6 people ordering steaks shouldn't have all six returned multiple times for being undercooked. They even served the salads warm. 

I have dined at this restaurant more than a dozen times and have recommended it even more than that. I now regret having sent anyone there. In addition to ruining the meals of my entire travel party, the food poisoning had me confined to my room for the entire trip. 

If you're thinking about going to this restaurant, dine at your own risk. IT WAS THE WORST MEAL I HAVE EVER EATEN!!"}
{"text":"Recently dined here to celebrate a friend's birthday - what a great choice! Mastro's is centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip at the Crystals Shops. Part of the restaurant has this cool area called the 'Treehouse' which overlooks the shops below. Mastro's has a pretty even ratio of steaks/chops and seafood items. Once you're seated they bring a nice assortment of breads in a basket (my guest liked the pretzel rolls especially). There's a good amount of appetizers and even sushi and about 8 salad options. As we both recently had steak - we decided to order seafood - I ordered the Grouper and my guest had the Fillet of Arctic Char (very similar to salmon but not as 'fishy' IMO) and we shared sautéed asparagus, twice baked potato and steamed broccoli - it was A LOT of food and we ended up taking stuff home. Both fish were very nice and flavorful and prepared just right and the side dishes are served family style so one side dish is at least good for 2 - 3 people (if you have a group order different ones to share). Make sure to save room for desert for the 'famous' warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped cream. OMG!! This will take cae of any sweet tooth! LOL They put a candle and wrote 'Happy Birthday' in chocolate on the plate and my friend absolutely loved it and so will you! I recommend making reservations as it gets busy. Bring your appetite and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I visit Mastros often and would like to update. We had our corporate Christmas dinner here and Brandon could not have been better. They just know customer service and their food is incredible. Christina served us at the bar area. She was outstanding. Knew the menu and wine list. I didn't have to ask anyone else about my favorite Pinot Noir. She made us feel at home. Best things: lobster roll, filler mignon, Brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes. Of course, the butter cake. Loved it."}
{"text":"Go here a few times a year for birthdays etc...

Great service - stellar classy service.  FAST - efficient!

Best filet on strip hands down - gorgeous taste and preparation - worth EVERY penny.

The apps are great too - though adding some grilled shrimp would be nice touch.

Dessert cake is ridiculous and to die for.

ALWAYS a treat and first rate."}
{"text":"We stopped on a Monday night for drinks and dessert and the place was rocking.
We sat at the bar and the bartenders were friendly and attentive.  They have a great dessert menu with live music in the lounge."}
{"text":"The ribeye is a little fatty but overall very flavorful. The butter cake is very rich but very easy to split with other people to provide a rich ending to a great meal."}
{"text":"I love love love the Chilean Sea Bass at Mastro's! Delicious! Mastro's maes my top 5 favorite restaurants list for sure!

Service was excellent. Entertainment (guy on the keyboard & a singer) at the bar was a nice touch, but we were right next to them, and it was a bit too loud. Sittng further away woulda been better, but it was okay.

Complimentary bread & butter: yummy! Boyfriend loved the pretzel bread.

Crab CakeS: yes, they give you 2 crab cakes. Lol! Hate when resataurants only give you 1 and charge you an arm and a leg. This is not the case here. They were big, chunky and delicious! Great for sharing with 4 people.

CHILEAN SEA BASS: really...need I say more? Like butter!

Petite Fillet: melt in your mouth good!

Warm butter cake served with ice cream and whipped cream: another must."}
{"text":"We were celebrating my wife's birthday and decided that we would go out for a nice dinner.  After a couple of our first choices were not available, we did get a reservation at Mastro's.  I can see why they had availability on a Saturday night.

The night started out really well.  The live music in the lounge was very good, and our server in the bar recommended a fantastic Riesling.

Once we were seated, our server recommended a couple of salads.  I had a spinach/bacon salad.  Nothing special, but ended up being the star of the meal. 

For the main course, I decided to try the vanilla batter twin lobster tails, because I read that it was a specialty of the chef.  I should have known something was up when the server also said I could get the tails baked or steamed, or a combination of those options.  I chose steamed and the vanilla batter.  The steamed tail was just fine, as expected.  The battered tail tasted like something from Long John Silvers.  It was so salty, and greasy, it ruined what should have been a great dinner.  

We also ordered a twice baked potato to share.  This should be a very safe and tough to screw up dish.  They managed to do so.  My wife and I both commented that we get better twice baked potatoes from the grocery store, and we certainly prepare them better.  These must have been sitting out for a while, and were probably over cooked to begin with.  They were so dry, we could not finish it.

We had two waiters for the evening, and we never saw them.  I'm sure they saw our meal and did not want to check in with us.  No refills on our water, much less filling our wine glasses.  I did see the manager at another table, but she did not stop by to see us about our meal.

The star of the meal if there was one, was the portion size of the ahi tuna sashimi.  It was reasonably priced, but loaded with seeds, so bad that it was a chore to wade through them."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant in the Crystals mall at the City Center development.  It's part of the Mastro's chain, which I was familiar with before my visit from their store in Beverly Hills.  Despite the intimidating size of the City Center complex, if you park in the Crystals valet, getting in and out is really pretty easy.  The restaurant is everything you would expect from an eatery at this price point and more.  The service is immaculate and attentive. (I particularly like the flourish that comes with the simultaneous presentation of all of the table's entrees.)  Also, the manager came over and checked on us to make sure everything was perfect as well.  This restaurant has the steaks that you would expect from the Mastro's name but its primarily focus is seafood. (Thus the \"Ocean Club\" moniker.)  The quality and preparation are top notch.  In terms of the facility itself, part of the dining area sits in a stylized banyan tree. (Really.)  It certainly makes a statement and is definitely where the cool kids want to sit.  Finally, while it will shave months off of your life, you absolutely must have the butter cake desert - I lack the vocabulary to describe how utterly scrumptious this myocardial infarction inducing item is."}
{"text":"We went with a group of six and sat in the \"treehouse\". Our service team took very good care of us. We started with generous martinis. The generous side dishes are perfect for sharing. I really enjoyed my seared ahi tuna. The butter cake was a great way for the group to share dessert. The prices were lower than we expected and it was a good evening for our group."}
{"text":"This is probably a 4.5 star review, but there really wasn't anything to gripe about, so let's ring in the New Year with 5 stars! 

I've been interested in visiting Maestro's Ocean Club for quite some time. I'm a seafood lover, and a lover of fine dining, so it is right up my alley.

Located in Crystals, the layout is interesting. You simultaneously have the feeling of being in the mall, yet separated from it. There is a dome of sorts as the ceiling, so shoppers cannot see inside and gawk at the diners, but the diners can somewhat see out into the mall. Tables are a smidge close for comfort, but that's just a personal preference.

Service, as expected, was wonderful. Our server was friendly, personable, knowledgeable and professional without being overbearing. There is an extensive cocktail list, and I enjoyed my cocktail- \"Strawberry Dream\", which is very sweet, but I like sweet drinks.

For an appetizer, we split the lobster cocktail, which ended up being more meat than originally expected based on the presentation. Although the server warned us about the heat/kick of the \"atomic horseradish\", it actually was quite bearable, and complimented the lobster well.

I opted for the crab cakes as my entree, and they were also quite good. Perhaps not the best crab cakes I've ever had, but certainly a fine showing. They perhaps could have used a bit more seasoning, or some of the horseradish, but they were full of meat, and the little filler held things together well. We got a side of the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese, and wow!! Huge portion, and holy cheese, batman! Super cheesy!! Really good, very mild though. 

For dessert,  we split the butter cake, and it was melt in your mouth good. Seriously. The homemade whipped cream along with the ice cream may have been overkill, but if you're going to do dessert, might as well go all out! 

Of course, Maestro's is on the expensive side of things, but if you want a solid seafood fine dining experience, I wouldn't shy away from it."}
{"text":"Pretzel bread was amazing. Must try their seafood tower! Even the lemons were on point with the freshness! Their food is family style and the waiters come around and serve the food to everyone at the table . Mac and cheese was delicious !! Great date spot and the treehouse was a great atmosphere . Will go back"}
{"text":"we came here for my fiances birthday bc he loves the mastros back at home in Beverly Hills. I'll have to say it's not comparable. the service was excellent. as always. however their steaks we're just not up to par. I ordered the filet mignon, medium, and it came out well done. I wanted to say something to our waiter but I didn't want to ruin the vibe celebrating my fiances birthday. everyone else in my party thought their steaks were just okay as well. they had the bone in rib eye. 

we also ordered the cream of corn and fries. the cream of corn just... didn't taste good so I don't recommend getting that. the fries were typical and not so bad.

I don't think I'll be coming here anymore when I come to Vegas. I'll just stick to buffets."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club...skip the valet and park your car far, so you can walk off what youre about to consume. you will be stuffed, and still go home w/ tasty leftovers.

well worth the money you will be dropping for dinner..impeccable service, mindblowing fresh seafood out in the desert & man do they know how to make a drink. martinis here will knock you over.

Once again, skip the breadbasket, request only the pretzelrolls (and butter!)

Seafood Tower: Dungeness Crab Cocktail, Shrimp Cocktail, Blue Point Oysters, Kumamoto Oysters
Sauteed Prawns

Bone in Ribeye
Bone in Filet
Chilean Sea Bass Oreganata style

Asparagus
Mastro's Mashed Potatoes
Lobster Mashed Potatoes
Twice Baked Potatoes

Creme Brulee

Pick any of the above, and you will leave a little poorer, a few pounds heavier, a wee bit tipsier but fall asleep with a big smile on our face.

But if you're watching your wallet or just want to chillax, hang out in the lounge area, order a few drinks and one item to share, munch on the free pretzel rolls, and 40 bucks will make it a night on the town, in the dessert."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. AMAZING service. Ive been to a couple Mastro locations, this one is slightly more laid back, which is nice. I'm not big into the overly attentive waiting, and clean up. But the food is incredible. The waiters are awesome. I can't wait to go back. This will be me returning location."}
{"text":"My friend treated me to dinner here for my birthday, and it was fabulous. 

I would've rated it as five stars, but I had a couple things that bothered me. First, we had a reservation, and came about 15 minutes early so we could grab a drink at the bar first. We checked in, but were not seated until about 20 minutes past our reservation. Not a big fan of having to wait that long past the reservation time. Second, I'm not a big fan of the dress code. It's supposed to be fine dining, and it is a beautiful restaurant. But, the fact that you see customers simply wearing t-shirts and jeans kind of ruins the whole thing. 

Other than that - all was dandy. Service was impeccable, but I would hope so considering the amount you pay to eat there. 

Food wise - we got oysters as appetizers. They were very fresh and tasted great. The clam chowder we ordered was decent, but nothing to rave about. I've had plenty of other clam chowders that easily beat the one at Mastro's. The steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection, and were complimented well by the sauteed mushrooms. 

Since it was my birthday - they did give us free chocolate cake, which was nice. Very light, fluffy, & moist. BUT, we did also order the warm butter cake, which I think most would agree is a must. Man, the chocolate cake was nothing in comparison. 

Overall, great place. Would definitely go back again, when I have the money to spare. 

And on a completely random note - they do serve Chilean Sea Bass at this establishment, which surprised me. This fish is known to be highly over fished and is on Seafood Watch's list of fish to avoid. Just thought I'd let you know."}
{"text":"I've been to this location before and as always, they are on point with their customer service. It's always great to see them work together as a unit and are attentive to the guests. The glasses are never empty, offering of seconds on drinks and breads are consistent. 

The waiters are very knowledgeable of their products. They know exactly how the meals are prepared and the taste of each item on their menu. They also offer great advices on how to maximize the flavor and food experience. 

The side dishes are large enough for a party of 4 and the main course itself are large enough to satisfy your hunger.

I have to be honest, the last time I was here, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and I was underwhelmed by the preparation. With that said, I wanted to give another fish another try since they are after all, the \"Ocean Club\". I  ordered their feature of the day, the halibut which comes 3 ways: pan seared, cajun/creole rub, or breaded. With the suggestion from the waiter, I chose to go through the pan seared route. It was a good size fish, served with tartar sauce on the side. The fish was prepared nicely. It was flaky and juicy. However, again I was underwhelmed with the flavor. In my opinion, it was bland and flat. The tartar sauce didn't do anything as far as offering another dimension on flavor. 

My friend ordered the lamb chop and he was not impressed either. It was prepared well, pink in the middle and tender but he said he was expecting more flavors.

The other friend ordered a tomahawk steak and it was big! He said it was good and flavorful. From the look of it, the meat was prepared well also. Perfectly pink in the middle throughout. He said it was good but had better. 

My bestie ordered a wedge salad (of all the great options...she gets a salad!). She said it wasn't impressive. Just another wedge. Although she did mentioned that she liked their blue cheese crumbles. 

The lobster bisque was very rich in flavor and had a lot of lobster chunks. I love a good lobster bisque...but the cream was a bit too rich. I wouldn't have been able to finish one by myself due to its richness, good thing it was split in half.  

The lobster mashed potatoes were full of flavors and is extremely rich in butter and cream. It was served onto our plates by the host. The sugar snap peas were very tasty and had the perfect crunch and bite to it. The fries were just fries. 

We were all too full to order a big dessert, I really wanted to order their butter cake but couldn't bring myself to do it so we ordered the creme brulee. It was served with a big bowl of homemade whipped cream and was a good compliment to the dessert. The brulee was sweet and the cream was not which balanced out the flavors nicely.

Overall, it is a great experience but I don't know if I can justify eating the fish here."}
{"text":"The lobster mashed potatoes is absolutely delish!  We came here on a Wednesday night and there was live music which was pretty cool.  We ordered Kumomoto oysters and the scallops for appetizers and share the bone-in filet and the mashed potatoes.  Everything was delish and our server was super attentive.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times, and each time gets worse and worse. 


1: Was seated, and unattended to for 5 minutes. No menus, water, nothing. This would be understandable if the restaurant was busy, but 7-8 servers were just standing around talking on the opposite side. 

2: I ordered a glass of wine and the proper way to serve it would be to have me try it first before pouring the glass. It was brought out like a coctail. 

3: I was given 2 choices for water- flat and sparkling. I said flat and was charged $17 for 3 glasses of water filled twice. 

On to the food....

I have long given up on the entrees at Mastros. I have never received an entree that lived up to standards. 

We ordered the following:

Clam chowder- pretty good 
Lobster bisque- delicious
Crab coctail- amazing
Crab cakes- way too fishy
Lobster mashed potatoes- amazing
Gorgonzola Mac n cheese- too rich for my taste. Could only have one bite 
Brussel sprouts- perfect
Bone marrow- burnt to a crisp and could not scrape any marrow out 
Butter cake- the one thing that saved the entire meal 

In the future , I will have dinner elsewhere and come to Mastro's for coffee and dessert only."}
{"text":"Definitely start with the seafood tower everything was fresh and chilled. The escargot was okay but not what I'd hoped for. However service was top notch and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Wonderful! Ultimate 5 star experience in Vegas! We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. We loved the appetizer tower that can be mixed and matched. Oysters were fantastic. The cocktail shrimp vanilla  We sat inside the 'space ship' or 'UFO'... Be sure to request this seating during your reservation.

To begin... Cocktails: Paloma was fantastic for the tart drink lovers. Elderflower martini was better for the sweet tooth! 

Appetizer: Cocktail jumbo shrimp, vanilla battered shrimp & oysters... Delish! 


Salad: We split the iceberg Wedge, please note that in photo... It's only half. The bacon used was a sweet hickory smoked Wisconsin bacon. Amazing. 

Soup: Lobster Bisque. Phenomenal. Rich & Creamy. 


Entree: Filet. Ordered med well but the cut was too thick and it ended up well done on outside and almost rare in the middle, but it was still fantastic.

Side: King Crab & Black Truffle Gnocchi- TO DIE FOR. An absolute must. Yes, I actually chose this over my standard potatoes au gratin with steak and was do glad I did.

Creamed spinach was fantastic. 

We ended our meal with Cappuccinos.

Thank you for well educated wait staff and quality service."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the New York steak. The steak was excellent. We really enjoyed the dinner and will be back."}
{"text":"Best service I have ever had!  The steak was absolutely perfect (I've been back twice, once to the one in Old Town and another to the steak house on Pima, and it has been consistently perfect)!  And for dessert, it isn't even a question: you have to try the butter cake if you have not had it before.  When I am in Scottsdale, I can't go to another steakhouse; I'm ruined forever."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. We were going to go to Bourbon Steak but was recommended this place. I am so glad we went. I honestly started feeling sick and had to have the food packed to go before receiving it but I ate it today and I am beyond pleased. There was so much flavor and love in the food; not to mention portions are great. My husband ordered the lamb with spinach and brussel sprouts. I had shrimp and garlic mashed potatoes. Yummy, I have been telling everyone all about it."}
{"text":"Great live music and atmosphere near the bar. The menu is almost exactly like City Hall and the service is just as spectacular. The food is pricey, but completely worth it. The one thing Ocean Club has over City Hall is the band. They sound WONDERFUL and the atmosphere is hopping. If you want a fabulous meal and great entertainment,  this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"We had a great meal with excellent service. I wish I could say what a good meal in a great restaurant is worth. We started with Grey Goose martinis. I am used to paying $15 but these cost $20... but served tableside with a generous pour...   The menu has good choices. Friends had Chilean sea bass which they liked. My wife spent $35 on fois gras which was great.  My $56 bone in ribeye seemed expensive but was great.  The Brussels sprouts, green beans and scalloped potatoes were excellent at $13 each.  The $12 crisp was appreciated. As I said, expensive but all very good. I found an unusual and amazingly low priced petite sirah on the wine list. We got it. We liked it. I was disillusioned that the \"computer\" added $20 to the price. It was corrected but I shouldn't have had to catch it. Should you have dinner here?  As a Ugandan friend said years go (in a different context), how heavy is your pocket?  This place is really good but expensive, which has been my experience at other Mastro's restaurants. If you aren't price sensitive, check it out. If you are on a budget you will find it stressful.  For us, it was good. We don't do it every night."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in my meal at mastros ocean club. I ordered the lobster bisque which came out cold as an appetizer. There were minimal lobster chunks (3 tiny ones) in the soup. My friend also had ordered the lobster bisque which was brought out after I had finished mine. The steak was delicious as usual but we waited about 45 minutes in between courses which I was not too happy about. 2/5 stars might be generous. Mastros is expensive and I was here for a special occasion. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I could go on all day!!! PHENOMENAL!! Started with the Calamari, AMAZING! Make sure you use the dipping sauce! Oh, and try the Shrimp Cocktail ... the presentation with it being served over dried ice is awesome!  Then I had the Chilean Sea Bass... a very large portion and perfectly prepared. Ad a side I had the Crab and Black Truffle Gnocchi. Un-matched...perfection!
The meal was topped off with thier signature Butter Cake, compliments of the concierge at the Westin who recommended and booked our reservation.
Service was impeccable..staff were pleasant and knowledgeable. 
If you are in Scottsdale, DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DINE HERE!"}
{"text":"My party came here to celebrate a milestone birthday and we all agreed that everything was top-notch.  Located in the Crystals shopping complex, Mastro's cuts an imposing figure from its perch over and above the mall.  Most of my party ordered seafood and all of it was delicious.  My salmon fillet was perfect and made me feel full and fabulous (thanks, omega-3's!).  All of the side dishes (brussels sprouts, asparagus, etc.) were served by the wait staff and everyone's glasses were kept full.  Mastro's gifted my birthday celebrating friend with a free dessert (butter cake) -- this dessert is worth another visit!  Yum.  Wait staff were also patient with another friend's toddler, who insisted on wandering about and mingling with the singers (dinner music) of the evening.  Thanks for a lovely evening, Mastro's!"}
{"text":"If you are a seafood lover, be sure to make a pit stop here.  Absolutely gorgeous design, impeccably-trained staff, delicious food and excellent booze selection make this establishment a winner.  Only issues are the mall location. Also, I made a reservation yet I was made to wait in the bar for 30 minutes, yet I noticed tourists in shorts with their Forever 21 bags sitting there eating dinner, they were obvious walk-ins so I wasn't pleased about waiting.  Bathroom is a hassle, requiring an elevator or flight of stairs.  But one of the best restaurants in Vegas.  Oh if you are expecting to eat cheap here, forget about it, you're looking at about 75 per person, without drinks."}
{"text":"Food is great, service was amazing , but very very expensive. Not that the cost takes away from the meal as the food and service pretty much made up for the price .  The bar scene was pretty comical and trying hard to be a mini Vegas but everyone was having a good time that wanted to be there ."}
{"text":"The food was good, not anything materially tastier than a morton's or other selective fish house.  the decor is awesome, so is the service.  the wine list was pretty progressive, some old world off the charts selections and some new world innovative product.  by and large though, it didn't have the WOW factor.  It didn't deserve the $$ they were charging."}
{"text":"A mediocre experience. Awesome, awesome service (probably best of the weekend) let down by seriously overlooked fish and an 1hr15 wait for food. After being met by the friendliest server in a city of friendly servers, we were about to eat our own arms as food arrived. The sides were great - but the halibut was so rubbery and dry. We sent it back and by the time 2x new ones arrived - we had eaten enough sides we were full and didn't really get to enjoy it.
  
I was going to give 3* then remembered the worst part. When the bill arrived, the server smiled and said I hope that's ok - I thought great, she'll have taken off the overcooked entrees. Opened it up and last item was -$xx for 2x entrees. Perfect. But then the total felt too big still - so checking back up the menu, they had ADDED the 2nd lot of recooked fish then removed it again at the bottom so it looked just removed - most people after a couple of drinks no way would've noticed that. SUPER sneaky. Kinda took the edge off the whole experience really - doubt we'll be back"}
{"text":"A wonderful meal in a comfortable environment away from the snarl of snow birds in old town.  The host suggested we eat in the lounge and it was a good choice.  The live music was good to hear and still allowed conversation.   I had the Mahi mahi and my buddy ordered the swordfish.  The meal was fantastic and nearly as impressive as the extensive bourbon list.  I'm not one to request specific servers, but Andy would be an exception.  Funny and friendly made for a enjoyable experience.  Kudos to the chef and Andy."}
{"text":"I went here on a Saturday evening. What a bad choice. I sat at the bar and oh my goodness!!! What a pick up scene. Marley and band was playing that night. The music was great. The constant Casanovas slithering by was ridiculous. This is a great establishment to take a date to, but single women sitting at the bar beware. 

I had the shrimp martini and the chopped salad which were both very enjoyable. The Ketel One and cran was to my liking.  Not a fan of being picked up on while I eat. But hey, you can't blame a man for trying, right?"}
{"text":"Went for Father's Day, some dishes weren't on par with their usual quality. To bout, our waiter was borderline rude (which was a first for them) and we were charged for an extra entree. Sad they ruined the Father's Day meal."}
{"text":"Very accommodating. Had a ton of family in town, staff handled it with ease. Consistent with their food and service. Always a great night."}
{"text":"It's a schmuck tourist rip off spot.  Lot's of beautiful, phoney, 'wanna be's' who want to gawk at the eye candy at the bar. Outrageous prices combined with arrogant, snooty servers. I ordered crab legs for 'Market price' and got TWO legs.  RIP OFF.  Go to Dominick's, Capital Grill, or Steak 44.  
Not been treated as poorly in ANY OTHER restauants in the Valley. Take money as this meal will cost you a fortune.
NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable.  I have never had a bad experience at Mastros. The martinis are about two drinks they bring out in shaker with dry ice. Steak cooked to perfection and ahi tuna is deliciously seasoned. They have tower of build it yourself seafood. Butter cream cake with whip cream made from scratch. Live music. The crowd and ambiance is great. I love Mastros!!!!  I will be a return customer over and over again!!"}
{"text":"This is the second Mastro's location that I have gone to. I've been to the one in Thousand Oaks, CA a few times and thought I would give this location a try. It is located in the Crystals shopping plaza that is next to the Aria hotel. This place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your Sunday best. 

I made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a Saturday night. We had a nice table an attentive waiter. We got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  There was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. 

I still went with the meat selection even though this was the Ocean Club. My boyfriend and I both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. The meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. The steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, I call it Meaty Symphonic Harmony. 

We also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. This is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. Each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. I was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). 

Dessert is something that just can't be missed and I suggest the sinful delight of the signature Warm Butter Cake and whipped cream. The butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. It almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate. 
This is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say about this review.
It almost became a 2 star review but our server was knowledgeable, personable and friendly, it didn't seem fair.

Food is highly unimaginative. With this sort of price tag, you would think there'd be something special about the food.

There isn't.

The quality of the meats itself, was wonderful. Definitely have a good supplier and though, I didn't care for the flavors of the food, the fish, scallops and crab was fresh and didn't have a terrible ocean taste.

The execution is mediocre. Flavors were not complementary, almost overpowering. With fresh seafood, you should let it shine but I felt like an amateur who didn't understand the lightness of the seafood made our dishes.

We did receive a complimentary cheesecake because it was my bff's birthday.

With how much we paid and the overall taste and quality. Don't even bother coming here, there are too many good restaurants on the strip to settle for Mastro's.

You've been warned!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Mastro's since they opened in Vegas and have been to a few different locations in S. Cal and it one of my favorite places in Vegas.  We went the other night for my birthday and everything was excellent.  The seafood platter was fresh and come with great sauces.  All the steaks, chops and fish were really good as well.  The Butter cake is also a must!  Make sure to make a reservation, especially on a weekend and bring your wallet!!"}
{"text":"Was really underwhelmed with the cocktails, food and service. Steak was over cooked, we had to send some of the sides back. Things came out staggered and not together so by the time the sides came out the steak had been sitting on the table for 5 minutes or more. Manager removed the bad sides from the bill, but didn't seem to care about the horrible service when we spoke with him. No apology or anything... Was really disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Yes it is expensive. The food and service matched the price.  Highly recommend the lobster tail and butter cake.  The horseradish is the hottest I have had.  Be prepared to wait past your reservation time.  The challenge is everything is so good people don't want to leave."}
{"text":"Always a favorite stop for us when we're in town. I'm never disappointed, never leave hungry and never leave wanting more...

A feast for the eyes. Satisfying for the stomach. Yes!

We started off with crab cakes. Yes, pedestrian. But I was starving and wanted to keep it simple with my G&T. 

We dove straight into the giant grand seafood platter. It was delicious and amazing. But I was slightly disappointed. The Dungeness crab was a bit salty. (I mentioned it to our server, he admitted they boil it in salted water. I felt they should dial it back. Dungeness is briny on its own. I suppose it's okay to put it in a lightly salted water for preparation. But maybe it was a bit much?)

Then for the final blow: Kobe beef with foie gras and lobster mashed potatoes. Yeah. Stick a fork in me. I was sick with regret a half an hour later. But I did enjoy it! The steak was perfectly medium rare and so tender I nearly didn't need a knife. Truly amazing."}
{"text":"My party of three had the most unpleasant, disappointing experience on Friday evening, August 12, 2016.  My sister and I took my mother out as part of her 85th birthday celebration that weekend.  (I am a member of the Palm but it was closed, and I know Mastro's from Scottsdale.)  Having had wonderful meals all week, I expected nothing less that exceptional service at Mastro's Ocean Club.  We had a lovely experience at the bar, but once seated, the experience went steadily downhill.  Aside from the very perfunctory service by our server, Michael, and some hiccups throughout the meal, the greatest disappointment was the rush to clear our main dinner plates and the placement of dessert plates for what otherwise would have been a surprise birthday cake.  We had to ask for lemon for hands, and when the linens arrived, there was no server to remove them, leaving us to place them on the table.  We waited for the cake, and had a nice little celebration, but then no server came to cut and serve.  I can serve myself at home, but I do not expect to do so when I am dining out. I can't say that Michael was busy as there were several empty table.  Perhaps my expectations were too high as I was expecting the service I experience at Preston's, Dominick's, and Capital Grill.  Mastro's Ocean Club does not come close to even sub-par."}
{"text":"Mastro's is my staple steakhouse. The service is always excellent and attentive. I've been a few time in the last couple of months and each time, the food & service have been impeccable. 

I typically order the bone-in ribeye. It's always been cooked to order, perfectly. The lobster mashed potatoes, truffle macaroni & cheese, wedge salad, crab cakes, and scallops are also excellent. The Brussels were a little overcooked and dried out the last time I was there, but the creamed spinach was amazing. 

I'm sure I'll be returning, as I have been for the last few years."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, and fresh seafood. If you are with a group of at least 3-4 people, the seafood tower is a must. 

This is a great place for seafood lovers and haters alike. They have virtually all of the same steaks that Mastro's steakhouse has as well as all of the fresh seafood choice. 

All sides are family style which makes ordering a little easier. 

Show up a little early and sit at the bar for some great people watching."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to eat at this restaurant for quite sometime. My husband and I were in town for his birthday and ate here on January 23rd.  We arrived to a bustling restaurant and were seated at the bar. The bar is quite impressive. We ordered cocktails and as soon as they were poured, the hostess came to seat us. Another host came with a tray to take our drinks so we wouldn't have to carry them. Very nice touch. We headed to the \"treehouse\" and were seated. We had a wonderful view of the entire treehouse. The bar drinks were outstanding. Our waitress was attentive and polite. We ordered an appetizer which was good. I ordered the Sea Bass while my husband decided on the petit filet. As we were ordering, our waitress overheard us say we would share and offered to have both entrees split. We also ordered the lobster mash potatoes. When our entrees arrived, they both melted in our mouths. The filet was so tender and the sea bass was light and flaky. After enjoying our dinner, we ordered the butter cake we had heard was so magnificent. Indeed, it was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten. We WILL be back in April and we will be bringing friends. This was a real dining experience. My only regret was not trying it sooner."}
{"text":"Went here again Sunday night with my boyfriend and as always, it was delicious.

I decided to leave an updated review because we order a seafood tower this time. We ordered Pacific Coast oysters on half shell, seared ahi tuna, jumbo tiger shrimp, the swordfish and scallops. The fish was cooked perfectly; it pretty much melts in your mouth. The sauce the scallop entree is cooked in is delicious. Oysters were good. Shrimp was HUGE. And the sauce the seared tuna came in was to-die-for. 

All the above was phenomenal. We racked up a pretty high tab including wine and whiskey but every penny was worth it.

Again, I didn't get to the dessert because I was stuffed but one day I will!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here the other night. I had been to the location in Arizona a couple times and I remember loving the entire experience. So, needless to say I was yet again pleased with my experience at the Las Vegas location. 

Honestly, I was a bit reluctant it being inside a mall, even though yes its the Crystals mall (which is not any average mall). We were seated at a table overlooking the edge, which kind of gave the appeal of being near a cliff. The host who greeted us was extremely friendly and personable. Our server greeted us within a few minutes and went over the menu and a couple items he suggested.   

We started with the foie gras and escargot for appetizer. The escargot was average but the foie gras was delicious. Served with some sprigs of green and toasted bread. We also enjoyed half a dozen oysters on a half shell. We then moved on to have our entrees. Japaleno tuna sashimi definitely recommend this item. Truffled gnocchi was delicious as well as the creamed spinach. 

Discovered a new wine as well, Leviathian, a red blend from St. Helena California. Extremely smooth and vibrant!

Still not disappointed with Maestro's"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday early evening just for their warm butter cake. It was a meal for two by itself. Tasty and of course buttery smooth with a slightly crunchy/crispy crust. The bowl of whip cream on the side was massive and well appreciated. Overall a good dessert but not great. The Caramel Bundino from DOCG and the Toffee Pudding at Gordon Ramsay steak easily demolish this offering however. Nice service and vibe though."}
{"text":"We heard the food was amazing and we wanted to check out the tree house location. 

The food and service met and exceeded our expectations. All the decadent extras enjoyed with a great meal, my personal favorite, truffle butter on petite filet. Plenty of specialty items, bone marrow, a seafood tower and a long list of specialty drinks-check out my picture of the top shelf at the bar.

The signature dessert is a must, a giant personal butter cake topped with ice cream, strawberries and served with a giant side of stiff whipped cream.

Service was impeccable, including the personal attendant in the restroom.

Our only disappointment was the location. The tree house is in the center of a shopping mall, so the atmosphere was a little less than expected."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Mastro's Ocean Club recently on a work related dinner.  We got to sit under the Tree House that overlooks the Crystals Shopping Center.

After waiting about 15 minutes to be seated, we started with the Seafood Tower because nothing says over the top LV dining like a seafood tower.  On this tower were jumbo shrimp, a variety of crab legs, and some oysters.  Served on the side were a traditional cocktail sauce, their atomic horseradish, and a mustard sauce.  I was a little too liberal with the horseradish sauce and can confirm that the \"atomic\" description is accurate.

For my main, I went with the Ribeye steak and the table ordered a variety of sides: lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, gnocchi, asparagus, and au gratin potatoes.  

Unfortunately, the highlight of my meal were a few of the sides.  I really enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese, the gnocchi, and creamed spinach, all of which were excellent.  But my steak left a little to be desired.  It was flavorfull, but the piece of meat simply had too much gristle.  I appreciate a bit of fat on my steak, but this piece of meat had just a bit too much on and I had to cut around quite a bit of my meal.  Based on the other reviews, it sounds like my experience may have been out of the ordinary, but from my experience, there are better places to try in LV."}
{"text":"Five stars... because I didn't pay. 

Actually, the one and only time I've visited the Ocean Club was for a company Christmas dinner.  I no longer live in North Scottsdale or work for that company and now the office Christmas Party consists of Boston Market chicken that we have to share.  Damn you, recession. 

Moving on, the Ocean Club has a great piano bar full of lively music and older men looking to hit on women young enough to be their daughters (me).  In all seriousness, I found the environment to be full of classy fun.  In fact, it was a bit rowdier than I expected it would be.   My martini had dry ice in it, DRY ICE.  If that doesn't look cool, I don't know what does.  The seafood tower was incredible.  I must say, this is the way to celebrate a year of hard work.

Bottom line, the Ocean Club does it in style."}
{"text":"WOW!  However not in a good way.  The food was good but I expected it to be better with the prices they are charging.  I do feel I would have enjoyed this place more if our waiter was a bit attentive.   One thing that annoyed me the most was that he kept on placing his hand on my shoulder (stay out of my bubble buddy),  I ended up tipping the bus boy on the side because he was around more than the waiter.  

For a restaurant like this the service should be top notch.  On a good note, the other diners around me seemed like they had my waiters attention.  It seemed since my date and I were younger then the other diners he didn't think we would tip him accordingly..."}
{"text":"I came here for a nice dinner with a special person, and I absolutely loved it. 

First of all, the xmas decorations in the mall were amazing. Set the mood very well for our dinner. We checked in with the hostess, and the hostess who walked us to our seats was very friendly. 

We sat next to the live band, a lady singer and a guy pianist/singer. They played really good music ranging from older American pop songs to older R&B songs with their own twist. I couldn't help but to quietly sing along during dinner. 

We ordered the following:

1. lobster mashed potatoes - this was the best mashed potatoes I've had in my life. They really don't skimp on the lobster meat either you would find huge chunks, and it was like digging for treasure! The meat was also cooked just right, and it was really fresh. If you go to this restaurant, this side dish is a must get if you like lobster. 

2. Sauteed Asparagus - pretty standard just got this dish to get some veggies. 

3. Petite Filet Mignon - usually I like more flavorful cuts like ribeyes, and I don't really like filet mignons because they are lean. However this steak was so tender and cooked just right. I enjoyed it a lot. It was just the right portion, 8 oz, since I wasn't too hungry.

3. Sea Scallops - I had a small bite, the scallop was cooked just right, medium rare, and the meat was so sweet!!

Definitely recommend to come here on a special occasion, or if you won from gambling!"}
{"text":"What is there not to love about Mastro's? Perfectly cooked and delicately tender steak is a given, as it should be for any high calibre steakhouse.  The accompanying dishes, wine pairings and cocktails were really what dining at Mastros to a higher level of excellence. 

The buttery lobster mashed potato was divinity on a plate.  Smooth, rich and very generously apportioned with large portions of lobster.  The shrimp cocktail was adorned with plump and juicy prawns (what we call them in Oz) and the accompanying horseradish really packs a strong punch. 

The only time I eat bread and butter is while dining at restaurants.  I certainly wasn't disappointed by the carefully arranged basket of bread and the purest of butter goodness at Mastros.

A rum based cocktail marked the start of our eating festivities and a good South Australian Shiraz ensured the gleeful fine dining momentum continued throughout."}
{"text":"Maestros is amazing! We added one more person at the last minute and the host were accommodating. We had a party at 7 and the night flew. Our server was great. Everything came out 5 stars. They must have forgot my boy friends steak but they were overly apologic and the manager brought it out himself. Portions are huge so plan accordingly. The check wasn't bad. 106$ each with tip and a lot of bottles. I got the 6oz Fliet and couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience of my life. Came with the family for my son's 21st birthday. Reservation was at 10:00. Main course didn't come out until 2 1/2 hours later. Service was horrible. Food was barely mediocre. I wouldn't recommend this abomination of a restaurant to anyone. I am usually pretty easygoing. I can't even remember the last time I even complained about a meal. Our reservation was at 10:00pm.  We sat in the bar and had drinks until our table was ready at 10:30. We sat down and our server took our drink order while we looked over the menus. The drinks came in short order and then the fun began. We ordered several appetizers, salads and our main courses. The appetizers included tuna so our server told us that he would bring those first since they came out quickly and he wanted them to be fresh for us. They did come out first. About a half hour later. An hour into our meal we were still waiting for our salads. Our server was off working the cash register. I couldn't get his attention so I got up and went over and asked when our salads would arrive. He looked at me like I had two heads and said he didn't know we wanted them out so quickly after our appetizers. Mind you we were now over an hour into our meal and had long since eaten the appetizers which were so so. They finally showed up a half hour later. I got up again and asked to speak to the general manager. The server told me it was all his fault but I insisted on speaking to the person in charge. Eventually someone came up who introduced himself as the assistant manager. He apologized profusely, told us that section of the dining room was running slow and what could he do to help. I said please send out our meals. He looked at me quizically and asked if I really wanted my food to come out right away since we still seemed to be into our salads. I said yes just bring the food. He said right away. A half hour later our meals had not yet arrived. I found our server and told him that most of us had lost out appetites since we were so upset with the service. We wanted to cancel our food. All except the birthday boy who still wanted his steak dinner. It finally came out. He had ordered it medium. It was charred nicely on the outside but when he cut into it, it was so raw I swear I saw the slab of meat start to squirm. We had to send it back. It came back and was cooked to the right temperature. My son took a bite and said it was OK. Some tried a bite and agreed it was very mediocre. He finished and we left. The impression we left with was that they thought we made far too much of our service. In fact we had assumed that the reason the assistant manager came over was that the general manager was not working that night. Not true. She was the woman with the walkie talkie hovering about in the background we later found out. She never once came over and and seemed to have no interest in trying to help us out. Please people, if you have any compassion, boycott Mastros. HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"Dining in the tree house is such a beautiful experience.
The atmosphere has truly gone above and beyond the usual restaurants on the strip.

The food is a delicate experience in which you must savor every moment. From appetizers such as thier incredible sea food tower, to desserts like the buttercake, or everything in between like thier incredible sides that compliment every entree. Mastro's is a must try.

From romantic dinners to corporate outings there is a seat for everyone at Mastro's Ocean Club."}
{"text":"It's always a spectacular experience when we come here. Our waiter was superb and had many excellent suggestions. We ordered the seafood platter which is my favorite dish to get and of course all of our entrees were just as good! I don't know what to say but that every follower is well spent whenever we visit. We came to celebrate our engagement with my soon to be in laws and had a blast! This is always our come to spot for all our special occasions!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants on the strip! The steaks come out on a 400 degree sizzling plate and the sides are to die for! I'm a regular here and come every week. The staff is amazing, the management is outstanding and my favorite bartender is Randy!!! Although a little pricey it is worth every single dollar! I don't know what i would do without this amazing restaurant. Keep up the amazing work!."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for the weekend and wanted to have a great steak!  This place was recommended by some friends.  We shared some appetizers, oysters, tuna tartar and the beef carpaccio.  They were great, I would recommend the tuna as it was amazing!  Followed by a ribeye grilled to a perfect medium!!  The steak came out sizzling on a 400 degree plate!  We also shared some side, mushrooms, scalloped potato and some asparagus.  The sides were alright but I'd have to say that this steak was probably one of the best I've ever had!!  Highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed another scrumptious meal. My absolute favorite is the Chilean Sea Bass. It's always so flaky, tender and the best in town.  We had excellent Service from Michael."}
{"text":"Business dinner while in Vegas. The appetizer tower to start was just over the top good. My God. Dinner was good and desert was some sort of soaked pound cake. Wow. 

Just glad I wasn't paying..."}
{"text":"With all the 5 star reviews, I was expecting to get wowed by this place.

The restaurant is pretty cool looking, and the waitstaff was excellent though the hostesses were not very hospitable.

There were 4 of us dining here and we thought the food was not very good.  Bland!!!

I had the bone-in ribeye which is the only steak I order and the flavor was just bland. Another person ordered the Chilean sea bass and we both agreed that it simply lacked flavor.  The lobster mashed potatoes did not taste good to all 4 of us.

The only thing I enjoyed there was the pretzel bread and their warm butter cake."}
{"text":"First off the seafood tower was amazing but everything after that was hands down one of the worst experiences I have ever had. We ordered a wagyu steak that was over $100 and it was served well done although we asked for MEDIUM RARE. The manager treated us like peasants when we brought this to his attention, walked away before we found a resolution, and ignored us for over 15 minutes following the encounter. They then brought us an ice cold steak to try to resolve the situation. I unfortunately had a client dinner here next week with my CEOs but I will have to cancel because I cannot take a business risk."}
{"text":"Best Mastro's experience ever! Peter was our server and he was phenomenal. He went over the menu with us, as well as wine and cocktails. He helped with pairing the best wines with our entrees. I was so impressed! To top it off, the managers Aaron and Daniel came to make sure everything was perfect. Our entrees were spot on perfect! I will come here every time I come to Vegas. Best steak I've ever had!!! Best service I've ever had! Love it!"}
{"text":"Reservation was at 9:30 but didn't get seated until 10 and was given some excuse that someone bought the whole wood area and it affected the rest of the reservations.  

They treated us as we were small potatoes compared to the large group.

Will not go to any Mastor's again.

Food was good though."}
{"text":"Need to blow off that easy money you just took from the casinos and treat yourself to a neat dinner in a unique spot which calls out for attention the moment you walk into Aria?

Enter Mastro's, the ever popular chain of steaks that knows just how to let you indulge and live it large on a nice meal.  And as for pricing, it's actually pretty fair as you get a ton of great service, and most importantly, great food.  

The steak would be the only thing I get to be a snob about.  For instance, the meat was a little tough and although they've caramelized it, I can't but imagine thinking of how similar it tastes to Ruth's Cris.  But luckily, the other sides gave it supreme justice.

I got the bone in rib eye, at medium rare, so it should have been tender, but somehow wasn't.  The flavor was just buttery and I just wish there was more.  
Just to make things interesting, I turf'd it up with combination of jumbo shrimp scampi.  The amazing garlic sweltering sauce which had a parmesean bread crisp  reside next to made all the difference in the meal as the big shrimps were engulfed with flavor from the buttery garlic sauce.  

For sides, we shared the following:
-Roasted Brussel Sprouts - pretty basic, but satisfying
-Cream of Spinach - so damn heavy and big its a good thing we only limited ourselves to 2 sides only on top of our surfs.

Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but would I come back?  Probably not, or to any of the other locations for that matter at the time being."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal last weekend... only exceeded by the service.  Our server, Lloyd, was put to the test with a table full of highly inebriated and hungry folks, and he passed with flying colors (or maybe it was the fireworks going on outside the restaurant).  Our food was stunning, even though I was served the smallest kumumoto oysters I've ever seen.  Three of us had fish and the other three had steaks.  Everyone was highly pleased with their meal, but again, Lloyd stole the show with amazing service, a great sense of humor, and attention to detail.  The six of us managed to get out of there for $600 before the tip, which I think is not too shabby given the $40-$50+ per entree cost.  The Dungeness crab appetizer was one of my highlights and my blackened Florida grouper was absolutely perfectly cooked to medium.  I highly recommend this place for a special meal or for any celebration."}
{"text":"I like this one better than the one in Newport. *gasp*

The one in Newport is kind of dark / crowded and while this one is technically in a mall, I like the setting better. 

The menu is identical I think. Very good. I like the scallops. I like the lemon drop. Great food. Great service. This restaurant is beautiful. I like the CityCenter overall and Mastro's is a great part of it."}

{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants on the strip.  The wait staff is outstanding, the food is terrific and overall they give the impression that they care about everything.  There were five of us having dinner and everyone thought the restaurant was outstanding and most of all memorable."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars for Elizabeth, the berry blast cocktail, the lobster mashed potatoes, the calamari sauce, and the creamed spinach.

I give 3.5 stars for the seared tuna (sliced thinner than any place I've ever seen), the bone in ribeye (one grain of salt away from being too salty) and the rack of lamb (charred too much on the outside).

Overall it was a good meal but I wouldn't order the lamb again. I only ate one chop and took the rest to go. The seared tuna was a huge let down too. Also, we didn't receive a complimentary desert for our anniversary despite receiving well wishes from several members of staff. It's no big deal but reading the other reviews it seems that it's generally given to everyone else celebrating. Next time we will skip the appetizers and enjoy cocktails/steak/sides."}
{"text":"Yeah yeah, this place is great (ribeye, lobster mashed potatoes, truffle crab gnocchi, butter cake). 

Comparing CRAFTSTEAK??

Service: Waaaaaaay better at Mastro's. Craftsteak reminds me of being on a Caribbean cruise, and that's NOT a good thing.

Food: Larger portions and better execution at Mastro's. Craftsteak seemed oversalted on its steaks and lacking on everything else.

Ambiance: *see Service comments :)"}
{"text":"Another great dinner there last night.  Filet great as usual.  My wife had the Tuna which was delicious.  Maybe our favorite place in town."}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened. Unfortunately, only once a year. 
Friday 8/26/16 I went for all the great reasons  one goes here for......
I ordered the the great ahi tuna tostada-y appetizer.  About two bites in I noticed a long black hair. Ugh...
The response and actions by the staff and manager was remarkable.  We all have miserable things happen at work and this is probably their biggest nightmare. 
Congrats O club personnel, you and your restaurant still rank as one of the best!

Looking forward to next year ..."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club is a gem that you cannot miss next time you're on the Strip.  Located in the newly designed City Center, just look for the beautifully designed \"tree house\", which hangs high above the ultra chic boutiques in Crystals that only the richest of the rich can actually shop in.  Be sure to request a table inside the tree house...it's where all the cool kids sit. 

Mastro's is not cheap, but then again, nothing in Vegas is.  In any case, it's worth every penny because the food is outstanding.  I started off with a very rich and tasty New England Clam Chowder.  For my entree, I went with the porcini mushroom crusted sea bass with fried spinach.  It was light but delicious!! Perfect for lunch.  For the side dish, what else but the lobster mashed potatoes! I'm not talking about lobster flavored mashed potatoes.  No, no, not at Mastro's.  I'm talking about over a pound of lobster mixed in the mashed potatoes.  It was soooo good and was big enough that all four of us could enjoy it with plenty to spare.  Although we were happily stuffed, our waiter brought out their signature butter cake with fresh whipped cream on the side for dessert; with his compliments (a very nice touch, which only further highlighted the tremendous service that we had during our entire meal). I highly recommend getting this dessert no matter how full you are. We all loved it.

I should note that the cocktails were also great.  Make sure you get one of their signature martinis, which comes with dry ice on the bottom of the glass that makes the drink bubble and emit smoke.  Pretty cool. 

Although I was able to get a table for four for lunch on a Saturday with ease through OpenTable, that won't last long because the restaurant only opened up 2 weeks ago and the buzz is still building.  Soon, Mastro's will one of the hottest tables in Vegas so get in while you can."}
{"text":"Okay the food here is AMAZING! For starters I recommend the crab cake or the ahi tuna. The bone in filet mignon is to die for and the butter cake is the only dessert you should ever order. 

Now, that being said I have given this place two tries and if you're going to eat here you better have plenty of time and no plans for the rest of the night. The first time was with my husband for my birthday and it took about an hour to get our appetizers and the restaurant was far from occupied. Not only did it take an hour but then the appetizers were burnt and had to be made again. We ended up being so late that we had to get our food to go. The second time we didn't make any plans but the service was very mediocre. The bussers kept bumping into my chair, the server disappeared for a while, the food took a long time (as expected) and when it came time for dessert they brought us out a cake for our anniversary and left before I could order a butter cake for dessert. I would have gladly paid for it but the next time we saw the waiter he dropped the check and left again. 

The food really is amazing. There isn't much ambiance and maybe my expectations are always too high for the service."}
{"text":"We were celebrating my wife's's bday, service was outstanding, we were in a bit of a rush to catch a show, and they were very accommodating. The scallops were out of this world and the ribeye was worth every penny. Only regret is not having more time to enjoy the moment."}
{"text":"Yelpers enticed us here--and we are glad we came. 
We started with the Dungeness Crab Cocktail. It was great, too tantalizing to wait and take a photo; we only could do so once we took a break. Delicious morsels of crab stacked in a bowl over dry-ice. The red cocktail sauce has some horseradish-but if you like it hot, ask for some on the side. 
We planned to order one of the healthy vegetable side dishes but our waiter Jonathan (\"Johnny\") gave such a wonderful description of the lobster mashed potatoes that we couldn't resist. 
Unless you're big eaters, the way to go is to split a steak. At the next table over it looked as though their steak was cut in half before cooking. But Jonathan suggested that he cut our bone-in Kansas City Strip into slices after cooking, served on a plate \"in the middle.\"  This was perfect.  Highly recommended. We couldn't even finish our halves of this delicious, well-cooked \"medium\" steak. 
The mashed potatoes were just as described. Great. A big splurge, but this dish added to our memorable meal. 
Too bad no \"desert pocket\" left for the longed for Butter cake.  Next time. 
If you're looking for a place for one of those meals you savor not only at the time but also in your memory for a long time, excellent food served by a pro, Mastro's is your place and Jonathan, who's been here since they opened, is the waiter you want."}
{"text":"I have now had two amazing meals here and can't wait to return.  The steaks, lobster mashed potatoes, and that brown butter cake are the must orders for me.  Sitting in the tree house is quite nice and I love hearing the live music from the bar.  The service is excellent as well.  I love being greeted by the friendly woman at the front.  (It's a pet peeve of mine when nice places put bitchy girls at the front who act like they are bothered that you showed up - ugh.)  The front people are so friendly, even on super busy nights.  All around - this is a really top notch place."}
{"text":"I was able to go to Mastro's for the first time ever and I'm glad my first experience was the tree house seating at the Las Vegas location with my best friend and spouse. We made reservations for our Best- Friendaversary :-) and we all were looking forward to going. Our expectations were all exceeded. I've never tasted flavors like those served at Mastro's. 

So, we ordered the smoked salmon appetizer for starters, blackened chilien seabass, a 12oz medium bone in filet, herb roasted chicken, garlic mash, creamed spinach and the Gorgonzola mac n cheese. OMG! Everything was delicious. We all ate off of each other's plates so we sort of had the whole surf and turf combo going since we all order different main dishes. 

Of course we couldn't without saving some room for the delicious warm butter cake which is like no other cake I've ever had. Served with best wishes to me and my best friend by Lionel. He was great and I won't forget him. He made my first dining experience at Mastro's very well worth it and I hope every time I go the environment and culture is the same.

BtW the Lemon Drops we amazing!!!"}
{"text":"What's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to Vegas? \"Go big, or go home\"? It basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. And Mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. But for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, Mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.

Located pretty centrally in the City Center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss Mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and I'm pretty sure I inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. Before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. You'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. And this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.

And let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. Our waiter, Lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. We were -THAT- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. His service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience I have seen yet in years of visiting Vegas. Add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.

But all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and Mastro's has this base covered, too. Oh, do they ever. My folks started with a bowl of clam chowder and a caesar salad, while I went with the lobster bisque. All three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. Ahem. 

Mom went with a red snapper that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which Lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best I've had at any place around the world. But the most surprising part was when Dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had sea bass before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his Chilean sea bass here was his favorite meal of this trip. A side of creamed corn and scalloped potatoes rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. Somehow, my folks found room for Mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. It's that good (even though I had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin I was drinking).

I cannot say enough positive things about Mastro's. From the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. Take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: I promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of Blackjack."}
{"text":"I LOVED my experience at Mastro's! Exceptional service from the hostess, server, and sommelier.

Every single thing we had tasted delicious. I had Sea Bass, it was perfect. Our table had steak, appetizers, and an array of sides. Highly recommend letting the Sommelier pair a wine with your order. Also, you MUST have the butter cake dessert! 

I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"As a 'local' in this town, it is one of our favorites, with the reason being that the portion sizes are so large that you will have left overs for at least one meal!  The prices do support this, but once you divide it by 2 or 3 I feel it is worth it.

The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  They are excellent at giving you the actual methods of preparation, ingredients, etc. on any item vs. places where they basically repeat what is written on the menu (yes, I can read).

The lobster bisque is sublime.  The creamed spinach is wonderful.  The fish and seafood I have had each time was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  And above all else...be sure to save room for the warm butter cake!

I feel bad for the tourists that usually leave so much on the table.  Me....I'm walking out with my doggy bag!"}
{"text":"One of the best steakhouses in Vegas if not the best! Had the wagyu Australian rib eye med rare. Great steak. Always great service also. Definitely check out mastros at aria if you have not. A++"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a mall which doesn't usually scream fine dinning. However the food and service are excellent. I would suggest the seafood tower! You pick from a large selection of fresh seafood. Comes out smoking with dry ice."}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago with my girlfriend and had absolutely the best seafood I have had in a long time.  We started off with a couple cosmos which are my favorite at the Ocean Club because they seem to be never ending and they use dry ice to keep it exceptionally cold!  For our entree we chose the seafood tower (see pic) which was amazing and a ton of food!  After that we could not eat anything more except desert and our waitress Shauna told us the Butter Cake could not be beat and she was right.  I would definitely recommend  Mastro's Ocean Club for a fine dining experience... the service is spectacular, the food is spectacular and the restaurant is very cool."}
{"text":"Live music, good food, really well made drinks! Pretty fun crowd in the bar area on the weekends.  No reservation required. Service is top notch, very attentive.  Would go back and try more from the menu, just had the lobster bisque and the butter cake.  Order the butter cake, it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food?  mostly great. The service? just ok. The setting? really loud, hard to hear others at our table. 

We had six at our table, most of whom ordered the sea bass. One of the six felt it was oddly slim cut and dried out. I got mine blackened and it was delicious. Calamari was nicely done. Salads were fine. Wine list is decent.

Main complaint: wide open space, really loud and not good for conversation. Our waiter had so many tables he could only allow us a very limited amount of attention. What do you expect for a minimum of $100/ person?"}
{"text":"There hasn't been one experience where I haven't loved ocean club. For any occasion that comes my way, my first instinct is to go to ocean club. The wonderful service , interior and food makes this a five star gourmet restaurant. I recommend who is willing to pay for their buck to come here because you will never leave not satisfied. If i had the option to come here every night I would hands down do so. Birthdays, anniversary's or graduations, this place makes it the best place to celebrate with class."}
{"text":"Here is how I would break down my review 

Service - 5 (great service and even removed the charge for my steak)
Appetizers - 5 (ahi tuna, stone crab legs, and shrimp all rocked)
Steak - 3 (1st was medium well, 2nd was rare...medium rare is not that hard!)
Sides - 4 (mac and cheese, steamed spinach,  and brussel sprouts)
Desert - 5 (butter cake is where it's at)
Atmosphere - 3 (I like the funky \"tree house\", but sitting in the middle or a mall adds a little bit of a \"food court\" feel)"}
{"text":"It's a bit overrated, service is great but food is mediocre,  I may give it another chance but tonight I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant overall. Had crab cakes as appetizer, 16 oz ny strip which was absolutely delicious, and as mentioned the butter cake dessert is a must. Overall great restaurant."}
{"text":"Great service, good food. Place stays busy so set reservations and enjoy."}
{"text":"So let me first start off by saying I don't eat seafood. At all. Allergies make life fun. 

With that in mind, I'd actually be giving this place a 4/5, but I can't say that as everyone came out very happy, including myself. The only drawback I had was the steak, an 18oz NY Strip on the bone that was nothing particularly special, but definitely adequate. When I say adequate, I mean a steak I'd expect to get at a mom and pop 'steakhouse' in the midwest, not one of the nicer places in Las Vegas. 

Mastro's has one of the coolest locations in Las Vegas. The exterior bar in the Crystal Shops is flanked by retailers like Audmers Piguet, Tom Ford and Richard Mille....I mean, its hard to walk into the restaurant when so many cool shops are right next to it....but hey, that's neither here nor there. It actually has nothing to do with the review, I just love watches. Actually, the interior design probably plays into other people's reviews, so...uh...idk, 5/5? Would interior decorate appreciate again?

The staff was amazingly attentive, down to Earth and incredibly good at their jobs. I was incredibly impressed with the knowledge of the somm, and our waiter was very, very good at his job. 

Everyone got appetizers, the foie gras was incredibly good...and I foolishly shared with another at the table. Given the portion was like 2 bites in total, I got one. Still damn good. 

Dinner came; steak was decent, potato was...well, a potato...hard to do anything with a simple starch that would be categorized as amazing, but it was an overall good meal. Everyone at the table raved about their seafood though, like...they loved the place. 

If you're still reading this, ha. But yeah, I personally think 4/5 due to 'meh' steak, but overall I'd definitely come back for the great staff, great location and great wine list."}
{"text":"First off, the service was outstanding. As per my request, they were able to save us a table inside the tree house near the edge, so we had a nice view of the architecture around us. Our server Sam managed to be attentive and informative without being too intrusive and asking us how the food was every few seconds, which I thoroughly appreciated. 

Usually I don't talk about the bread basket, but this one was pretty good. The bread was warm and soft, but waay too much for two people. On to the main courses: the rack of lamb was tender, juicy, and perfectly medium rare..kind of wish there was a bit more seasoning though. The bone-in ribeye was just as tender and more to my liking, although the outside seemed pretty charred...

After we were done with the mains, we barely had any room left for dessert, but I kept reading reviews for the warm butter cake, so we ordered it to share. The cake came with a HUGE helping of whipped cream on the side and a big scoop of ice cream on top...naturally, we couldn't finish it and asked to have it wrapped up. The cake was moist and the layer of crunch outside from the caramelized sugar was great, but overall, it was too sweet. =(  

We definitely made a good choice coming here. The food and service was all really good. Will definitely try to come back again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place for a date! If you're a bourbon fan, they have Blanton's, yum.. The service was pretty good, the portions are huge, and the steak was delicious. The lobster mash was okay, but I could live without it. The gnocchi was tasty. The macaroni and cheese was forgettable. Next time, I think I will do without the sides."}
{"text":"We stopped by at Mastro's for our Valentines Day Dinner last night.  When we arrived we were sat inside their Treehouse.....a fairly unique dining experience.  The Treehouse is their main dining area which is shaped like a Treehouse that overlooks the center of the Crystals' Mall.

For starters, we ordered their stone crabs abd lobser bisque.....both were very average.   The bisque was watery....not very thick and rich.

For our entrees, we had the sea bass and rack of lamb....both very flavorful and super tasty.  For sides, we had their creamed corn and lobster truffled gnocci....both were extremely, extremely rich (too much cream and truffled cheese).....but very flavorful.

For desert, we had their famous butter pound cake with ice cream and chocolate starwberrries......the cake was very average......I can get more flavorful pound cake at Safeway...the chocolate strawberries were good, but nothing spectacular.

The service was average at best.   Overall, the food was good, not great. One extra star for the cool treehouse dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been to nearly every top steakhouse in town, and you can't get a better steak anywhere. It's not just a great seafood place, it's a world - class steakhouse too. Food, service, atmosphere is all top, top notch. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful. I accidentally made a reservation with the Malibu location and they were able to seat us immediately anyways. Staff was incredibly friendly and we were greeted several times for water, bread, menus, etc. 

The menu is extensive and delicious. It was difficult deciding on a drink with so many amazing choices. Although I wanted to try the in house infused vodka's - the red wine recommended by our server paired nicely with our filets. 

We each ordered a filet and shared the lobster mashed potatoes. This was an incredibly amount of food. We weren't able to finish the lobster mash. We ordered medium filets with the black truffle butter. They were delicious albeit over cooked, which was a bit of a disappointment for a $52 steak. The lobster in the lobster mashed potatoes although plentiful was also over cooked and a bit chewy. Not a soft melt in your mouth lobster which was also a bummer. 

For dessert (which we did save room for since no appetizers were ordered) we couldn't decide between the flourless pudding cake (GF) served molten lava style or the creme brûlée (GF) - so when in Vegas - get both! And then we needed to be rolled out. They were amazing. The flourless cake was incredibly rich and neither of us were able to finish it. The creme brûlée had vanilla bean and was light and perfect. 

Our server George was great. He suggested a wonderful wine and was very knowledgeable on the menu and the ingredients the kitchen uses - which is helpful for me being gluten free. 

Our water was never near empty and servers weren't hovering over us obnoxiously and came and went with ease, barely interrupting our dinner conversation. 

The ambience of the restaurant is really cool as is the architecture. It does feel a little weird eating at such a classy establishment in a mall. 

The steak with the truffle butter was probably one of the top 5 I've ever had. Had it not been overcooked - likely could have been top 3. The meal overall was the most expensive we've ever had and it was good - but not the best we've ever eaten. For the price we paid, I would have expected close to perfection on every front.  

I'm struggling with either a 3 star or 4 star. This place has the potential to be 5 stars if the steaks are cooked properly and the lobster isn't overcooked."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant and I've been to most of the nicer spots in Vegas.  Great atmosphere (in Crystals shopping) and the food is simply amazing.  I had the sea bass and my husband had a filet -- both were beyond exceptional.  But the piece de resistance was their dessert.  We had their signature butter cake and it was literally the best thing I have ever tasted!  They are always busy so make sure to make a reservation!"}
{"text":"So disappointed in this Mastro's. My fiancé and I love Mastro's in Beverly Hills, we love the food but most importantly the service is great! We decided to celebrate my birthday in Vegas and what better way than to have dinner at Mastro's in Vegas. We had in mind it was going to be just as great if not better than Beverly Hills, but that was not the case at all. Upon arriving the table we were seated at was so close to the next table it was so uncomfortable I had to apologize to the couple sitting next to us in advance before getting through to my seat, and we were pushed right up against a wall where all the waiters and waitresses are constantly coming in and out of.

Our waiter was nice but he spoke so fast and also had a very heavy accent that we just could not understand what he was saying or explaining to us. My fiance' ordered steak and it had to be taken back twice because it was just too noticeably under cooked. After we ate we were looking forward to having their famous butter cake that we always have upon celebrating a special occasion and we ended up just paying our bill and leaving. We were really disappointed and most likely will not be returning back to this Mastro's."}
{"text":"Actually 4.5, but not a choice here.

So good! They know steak. The ahi tuna plate was delicious as well. Mac and cheese was sinful. I also had the Ceasar salad, mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes and butter cake for dessert. Everything was great, but the steak, ahi and mac and cheese were phenomenal. 

The place is cool. We sat in the tree dome looking section. It's also nice to have Tiffany's and Louis V. right next door.

Our table was up against another seating booth which I didn't like. I don't like strangers so close to me, especially when I'm eating. Don't want to listen to them and I'm sure they don't want to listen to me. Service was decent, but they were busy."}
{"text":"Had one last opportunity in Vegas to try out a highly rated restaurant and left very disappointed that it was wasted here.  The warm spinach salad was drenched in sauce and the ahi tuna tostada appetizer didn't taste very fresh.  The entrees do not come with anything else...no side pasta, potatoes, or salad.  So, if you order a bland grilled dried swordfish, that's it, that is all you get for $40 on a large plate.  Presentation in the food was not there for a so-called high-end restaurant.  The blackened scallop was so salty that it was difficult to eat it.  We celebrated our birthdays there and got a very dried complimentary chocolate cake.  We did order their signature butter cake also, and that was decent.  But, for $16, we have definitely tasted much better for less.  Overall, the ambience is nice.  Service was nothing to rave about, and food was very average.  Cost didn't match the overall underwhelmed experience.  If you are willing to spend, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love good seafood and great martini's and this place will not disappoint. You will need a bit of extra dough though as it's priced as  high as the quality of the food, but with every penny for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Service, food, ambiance just what it should be. Pricey ? Yes , and worth every penny from the cocktails, bread, Shrimp appetizer, to fabulous dinner choices. 
Friendly bar patrons and bartenders for just a cocktail. Love Ocean Club! Thank you! Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was great hence the 2 stars but I don't understand what the hype was all about. Our steak was part dry part medium rare in some area, our Seabass was super salty. We also ordered cream of spinach they made it extra creamy but that's my fault, it's expected."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! We had a wonderful experience there. Top-notch service and great food. Came here last week with my sister and my bf. We made reservation for 7:30 but we were about 15 mins late. The staff were really nice and didn't make us wait for our seats. We were seated almost immediately. Right when we were seated, the server asked us if we cared for any drinks and offered us a warm towel to wipe our hands with. He also explained EVERYTHING on the menu which I thought was awesome. 

My sister and I ordered two cocktails ($18/each for the cocktails) and we shared the salmon as a main course. For appetizer we had the escargot and oysters on the half shell. My bf ordered the filet mignon ($50+) but it was really tender and cooked to perfection. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes which I thought was great. The bill came out to be over $250 but I think it was well worth it for the great food, atmosphere and service.

I would suggest requesting for a seat inside the birdnest because every table is separated with a glass so it's very unique."}
{"text":"Been here now three times.  Also been to the one in Newport Beach CA.  You absolutely cannot go wrong dining here.  Service, Appetizers, Drinks, and FOOD is simply amazing.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  It's going to cost you, but it's TOTALLY worth it.  Save your nickels and make this a fun event for you and people you care about."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype. Started off with the lobster bisque soup of which the lobster was chewy. My friend had the heirloom and barrata salad and it was fairly decent. We shared the ribeye which was a bit dry but bloody if that can even happen. As a side we had the lobster mashed potatoes that had pieces of the lobster shell mixed in which brutalized my gums. We also had the sautéed asparagus that never made it to our table but we can only imagine what that would have tasted like. 

As far as service our waiter was good and the team that assisted him was good as well. I was disappointed that I had to box my own food for the price I paid but hey it is what it is."}
{"text":"We all had high expectations for this place and I must admit the expectations were met! Normally I am not a fan of \"steakhouses\" so I was pleased that my parents wanted to go to a seafood/steak place for their 35th wedding anniversary. I've been to City Hall in old town for steaks before and have always been pleased, so I think I knew what to expect from Ocean Club.

We arrived and were seated right away (with reservation on a Sunday night). They have a very large bar area (well known in the area as cougar hunting grounds) which looked nice and fully stocked. I think the bar area is actually larger than the dining room. The cocktails on the menu were expensive, far more expensive that the average for the area (approx $20 each), and they weren't that fantastic. But the wine and beer selection was fairly good.

Now, on to the food - We started with oysters which were SO fresh. I am always hesitant eating any seafood in Arizona (or anywhere landlocked) but you could really taste the ocean. Our server informed us that they fly in their seafood daily so ensure freshness. Not good for my global footprint, but I will accept the freshness none the less. Both the boyfriend and I got steak and lobster tail. I got mine with the small filet (6oz) and it was lovely and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the New York cut and seemed to really enjoy it. My father got the Mahi Mahi and also enjoyed it alot, I was surprised at the large portion of the Mahi. They offered to cook it a variety of ways, he chose to have it grilled with lemon. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. The lobster mashed potatoes had huge pieces of lobster in it, but was under seasoned. In fact, everyone put salt on their steak/fish/sides throughout the evening and we aren't big salt eaters. I suppose I would rather my food under salted vs over salted but you'd think when you pay so much money they would get the balance right for you.

All in all, the service was great, the food was good, and we had an enjoyable celebration. This place is very expensive but I'd say it's worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Mastros location for the last 4 years and never had any complaints, it has always been our favorite steakhouse. Now, we went for my boyfriends birthday last night with 8 of our friends and we did not experience the same taste that we were used to. Our server, i wish i remembered his name, was very nice. The dreamberry cocktail was outstanding. Most of us ordered steak of course which usually comes out pipping hot but this time it was luke warm at most. Although we did not voice our complaint none of us were happy with our steaks. The sides were good, creamed spinach and macaroni and cheese. I'm saddened to say I dont think we will be coming back any time soon. I believe we will continue with Stripsteak at the Mandalay Bay which is Excellent."}
{"text":"Diet is on vacation when we come here, the ambience is divine and being in kierland is a bonus.
I have had steak, lamb, fish and seafood here and it has always been sooo good! Unfortunately the Brussels are so inconsistent here tho. Sometime super charred and over buttery or else not enough char and no flavor lol 
Oh well can't win them all.....the drinks are amazing and the wine list GREAT
We are chocoholics so we usually order the massive chocolate cake slice but we have had the butter cake and the key lime pie and it's divine!!
The service is perfect always!"}
{"text":"The usual great live entertainment in a brightly lit mall setting. Bone in ribeye is perfectly seasoned. Appetizers and sides are great for sharing among 2 to 3 people. I recommend the Mambo Salad, sugar snap peas, and the lobster mash! Eating in a mall just doesn't feel as nice although we did see Tyson Chandler from the Mavs. Dessert is also a huge portion...enough to feed 3-4!"}
{"text":"The service is beyond friendly, but for $150 for the Waygu, I would of appreciated it not being salted to all hell. Couldn't appreciate the meat itself because I was busy downing water and could only taste salt. Cmon."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place ! Its amazingggg love love everything the appetizers are super good and the butter cake is heaven the service is excellent ThankYou this restaurant is my husbands and I favorite :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I went here with my mother in 2010 for my 21st birthday dinner. We had chilled dungeness crab, king crab, and shrimp. The waitstaff was incredibly attentive and made my birthday all that much more special. I cannot wait to bring my husband here for his birthday week in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I liked the enironment , the vibe, the waitress is so welcoming, and nice. The food is abit overrated I had a ribeye at that time, their cocktails are great. The guys that brings bread and fill your water did hit my chair several times without apologizing. Other than that it's a great place"}
{"text":"Don't usually go out to the club .......  
but when I do, I go to the ocean  club !!!
One of my favorite restaurants in the world  . This place has been super from day 1. Over 10 years and still the best !!!"}
{"text":"First for the foodies.  I've never been disappointed with a meal at Ocean Club.  The food is easily 4 stars.  It is always prepared how you ask, and have never felt out of line letting a server know if something is wrong.  The service is always great, plenty of attention, bussers keep the table clean, and if any member of the staff sees that you need something, they are happy to oblige.  I have had several cuts of steak, sea bass, and most of the appetizers.  I can't think of a single thing I've ordered and not been pleased.  Although drinks are expensive, it's worth ordering a martini because they give you the shaker with almost a full refill for your glass.  As far as nice meals go, Ocean Club hits the mark on every level.

The only reason I give this specific Mastro's 3 stars is strictly personal preference of atmosphere.  This place is BUSY!!!  Possibly too busy to really enjoy a fine meal.  It's definitely a social \"place to be seen\".  Evening gowns, expensive suits and colorful characters are not uncommon.  There is a special energy to this restaurant.  But that's where it crosses the fine line of dining and a social club.  I've sat in the bar dining area at a high top and felt like a sardine.  The table is not big enough for a bottle of wine and your food.  There are so many employees that you can't really have a long conversation without being interrupted.  And there is so much traffic, you feel like someone is going to crash into you at any moment.  Again, it's only personal preference that if I'm going to drop 2 or 3 hundred on a meal, I want some space to enjoy it.  For a special occasion to connect with company, try Mastro's steak house on Pinnacle or City Hall in Scottsdale.  Exact same food, more relaxed atmosphere and room to appreciate your company and a great meal."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend had told me about this place and although it had great reviews for a steakhouse. I thought it was just okay. The service was great which was a plus, but I thought the food was just okay. Maybe we're just used to the more traditional and old-fashioned steakhouses. There didn't seem to be much of a dress code and the steak (Ribeye) was too fatty for our taste. We didn't want anything lean, but this was too fatty. The best side to me was the creamed corn and the clam chowder soup was the highlight of my dinner. I will say it was my first time having clam chowder. The ambiance was not exciting at all. (Not for an *upscale* steakhouse. I don't think I'll come back unless I'm going to try the seafood or the butter cake."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Truly classy dining experience and the butter cake lived up to the hype. Perfect restaurant to spend my husbands 40th birthday."}
{"text":"Mastro's ocean club is one of Scottsdale's premier dining experiences.  The food is always top quality and the cocktails are always very well made."}
{"text":"Nothing less than the best! Each and every time we have dined @ Mastros we have been treated impeccably! Sam is by far my favorite waitress! She took care of us with attention to detail compared to none. The steaks are perfect and the warm butter cake is a must have on each visit! Fit for a queen!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. It was exactly what I expected. We enjoy the Beverly Hills location and wanted to enjoy the same in Vegas. The food was great and service was flawless!"}
{"text":"The manager on duty, Rudy, should work at McDonald's vs. Mastro's. He is unprofessional. Not only was he rude to our party of 6 ladies who arrived in a vintage Rolls-Royce stretch limo to have a quick cocktail for our friend's 40th bday but he was also rude to the staff that works for him. I don't think Mastro's wants this guy associated with their brand. Investigation, reprimanding and/or training is warranted!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Restaurant and impeccable service.  Request to eat in the treehouse and enjoy."}
{"text":"Was there while in Las Vegas for business. My hosts were contractors on the project and we maybe got a little extra pampering. There were 7 of us. 

Food is incredible. We didn't order appetizers, but a couple of us did have salads. The entrees around the table were steaks, swordfish, and seared tuna. We shared the stellar mashed potatoes, along with creamed corn and broccoli. For desert, they just left us the desert tray. We couldn't finish it! 

Service is second to none. Everything you would expect."}
{"text":"Simply immaculate. From the location, treehouse structure, service, and the food. We came here for an early Valentine's dinner. My husband and I shared the Wagyu tomahawk, I had a lobster and we ordered a couple sides. Everything was superb!! I can't wait to come back to try other options."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect in every way.  We spotted this place when we were first checking out the Phoenix area before we lived here.  Since it's a bit pricey we said to ourselves, this is where we will come after we move here and have something special to celebrate.  And that we did last night. I was a little concerned after reading some reviews about the busy-ness and it was a Friday night after all.  So I half expected we may be disappointed.  But, between being sat within a few minutes of our arrival, being greeted by the staff, taking our initial drink order, etc ... everyone and everything arrived in a timely and very professional and presentable manner.  In the lounge area, there IS a band playing and for us, we would prefer a bit more quiet as it was difficult at times to hear each other or our waiter.  But, the food and the service more than made up for any slight hearing impairment.  Expect to pay.  Drinks are $20.  My 2lb Lobster was $70 ... etc... but my God ... the food was AMAZING!  Filling and delicious.  The service was absolutely impeccable.  They will bend over backward to make sure you are happy.  I would definitely come back here often if budget permitted.  It's really some of the best food I've ever had.  The Shrimp and Crab Cocktail ... Best ever.  We also ordered two sides:  The Roasted Brussels Sprouts and the Sweet Mashed Potatoes.  Better than Thanksgiving.  My husband had steak ... he said it was awesome. I enjoyed the Lemon Berry Martini ... Yum.  And then ended the night with Chocolate covered strawberries.    This place definitely left a lasting impression and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Ocean Club, along with all the other restaurants in the Mastro's group, is as good as it gets.  While pricey, the service, decor, food and selection are all top notch.  I have eaten at all of the Mastro's restaurants several times and you just can't go wrong with any of their food.  However, I seem to always go towards the filet along with any of their delicious side dishes.  This time I tried the crab gnocchi and it was great."}
{"text":"What a great meal!  Excellent food served by a highly professional yet pleasant staff in a beautiful environment. We ate in the bar area which is bit more casual than the dining room but it visually appealing and very comfortable. I strongly recommend the KC Strip, Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese and Roasted Brussels Sprouts (they're definitely not your mother's brussel sprouts...no offense to my mother or any of the other mothers out there)."}
{"text":"Mastros you motherf*cker!! You have ruined me!! #MeToo, my tastebuds were assaulted by what is known as a marblelous (see what i did there) Japanese A5 Wagyu steak :'( I had never had a steak this wonderful in my life. When people say a steak melts like butter in your mouth, they must be talking about Wagyu steak. I know for damn sure there is no other steak out there that can compare. When i saw the price, I was like \"this steak better have gold flakes on it or something..\" it was $150 for 8 oz but I thought what the heck its Vegas and I'd been winning at the tables yeah baby! So after ordering a lemon drop , a delicious concoction thats sweet and sour and gets you all warmed up, I went for it. Needless to say, everytime I eat steak from now on, they will be compared to this amazing steak, and they will always fall short in expectations :(. The boyfriend got his usual ribeye, still on the quest for the best ribeye. Nevertheless, he thoroughly enjoyed his meal. We ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese and lobster mashed potatoes. Both sides were delish, the service was attentive and not pretentious at all. Our server George was very knowledgeable about the menu and even suggested we try an appetizer thats not on the menu, thick cut maplewood bacon. Oh my god, ot was sooo damn good!

They added a special touch at the end of the meal, bringing out a big piece of chocolate cake with a heaping serving of fresh whipped cream, having mentioned my bf was celebrating his bday. Oh my lanta, just what we needed to cap off an amazing dinner."}
{"text":"Took my parents to this place a while ago, and have been meaning to write this well deserved review, so now it's about time.  Get the sea bass- it will melt in your mouth (seriously), the spicy Cesar salad delish and the butter cake a total must to end an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for and you definitely pay a lot here.  The food is very good and the service is fantastic.  I would put them a notch above places like Morton's with a much more relaxed atmosphere.  If you can do it it's worth the splurge every once in a while.  You won't walk away disappointed as long as you've accepted the fact that you will be spending ~$100 pp."}
{"text":"My first time dining at this particular Mastro's and they did not disappoint. It was restaurant week but our group went and ordered our own stuff anyways. Yeah, this's place is that good hahha


Food Tried: 
Pretzel Bread - like a soft, warm, perfectly salted pretzel. 
Lobster Mash - delish
Mushrooms - I love these tasty mushrooms
Spinach - not a big fan of spinach but Mastro's does it right 
12 oz bone in filet - cooked just right. Med rare and awesome

Service: Great. Attentive and courteous. My friend couldn't finish his 22oz rib eye and asked to take the rest to go. They accidentally tossed it but went out of their way to make up for it. Our group was dressed casually and I can imagine some lesser establishments not giving us this type of great service based just on this alone."}
{"text":"I spend the majority of the month in Vegas. There are some good spots to dine at, but none compare to Mastro's. It's beautiful decor, great staff, timeless menu, and perfect good keep me coming back. The sea food tower not only has a wonderful presentation, but it is some of the freshest seafood I have found in the west. The steaks are superb and will not disappoint. The bar is beautiful and the drinks are outstanding. I would definitely start with a fresh sea food tower and end with the butter cake."}
{"text":"Awesome place , good restaurant for family or business gathering meals , good atmosphere. Crew is helpful, staff is ready . Food is delicious"}
{"text":"We finally tried Mastro's for valentines 2018.  We've been eyeing those lobster mashed potatoes for a long while but with a 35 dollar price point we just never ate there.  So finally we went.  The lobster mashed are worth it!  Easy reorder next trip.  Fish was excellent. Those were the standouts.  We would return for the fish and the mashed.  Some of the other items we tried were ok but not a reorder for us.  Service was great, room and atmosphere was great for Valentines."}
{"text":"This place is worthy of its high rankings.  There is a good selection of steaks and seafood.  It is located in this very interesting wooden alcove offering good people watching opportunities from some tables.  I thought our server was more than a bit officious, but the service from his busser and him was very good.  

My wife's Chilean sea bass with lemon caper butter was excellent.  She says it was one of the best servings of sea bass she has ever had.  The lobster mashed potatoes were excellent (at $35), as was the mac and cheese.  I was disappointed in my rib eye.  I order them a lot and the texture and taste of my serving was not to my liking.  Our friend's scallops were also excellent.

I would have given a ranking of excellent were it not for our server's demeanor and my steak."}
{"text":"Ordered the NY strip 16 oz. I asked for it to be cooked medium rare, but it was slightly more rare than I had expected. Nonetheless, it was still an amazing piece of big juicy steak. I would like to say that I went a little overboard with the whole pound of steak. The 12 oz would've sufficed.

We had a side of lobster mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes were really creamy and the lobster blended well with the gravy. Overall, I felt it was a decent side. Don't know why people keep raving about it.

We had sautéed mushrooms for our second side. These were very juicy and well flavored. Mushrooms and steak make an amazing combination.

I will definitely be returning next time to try their seafood."}
{"text":"Loved the dungeness crab cocktail. Tomahawk steak, not so much. It was just ok. I've had better. waiter was just rushing everything. So we were not that impressed. We will def try again. Maybe it was an off night."}
{"text":"Took my love here for an early birthday celebration. Our waiter, Johnny, was the best, so funny and attentive. 
We started out with the lobster bisque and it was heaven! I had the petit filet with scallops, my bf had the Kobe steak with sautéed shrimps, we had the lobster mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts for sides. 
The filet, steak and shrimps was delicious! My scallops was a little salty and slightly overlooked but still yum! The brussel sprouts was also salty and could use some shaved almonds and cranberries but overall good. 
Would definitely come back despite the whole meal cost me an arm, a leg and probably my first born."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite steakhouse in the country.  Steaks are the main attraction,  especially anything with a bone in.  Apps are delicious and sides are served family style.  Don't skip dessert"}
{"text":"Mastros over delivers every time! There are plenty of solid restaurants in Vegas, but no one provides the level of service Mastros does. The hamachi appetizer was amazing! Colossal size stone crab claws were lights out! Steaks are always cooked spot on and seasoned perfectly! Worth every penny you spend."}
{"text":"We are visiting Scottsdale from Dallas, Texas.   So I come from a city and state with some Of the best steak and seafood restaurants in the country.  We visited the Ocean Club on Saturday 2/24 and it was top-notch.  Ask for a man named Duke to be your server.  He was knowledgeable about each menu item and provided just the right amount of attention (not hovering, allowing my husband and me to enjoy uninterrupted conversation, but enough attention to where we always had everything we needed at all times).  I had a most amazing halibut, and my husband have a flavorful ribeye.  Phenomenal Brussels sprouts and creamy, cheesy scalloped potatoes.  Don't miss the signature butter cake with plentiful ice cream. If you're in Scottsdale, you must visit the Ocean Club."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets. Three of us went to Mastro's after deciding on seafood and reading the reviews on Yelp. Everything was top notch, including the attentive service, the gorgeous presentation of the food, and the portions. Some of my favorites included the crab cocktail (with an abundance of crab meat), served over a bowl with dry ice, lobster bisque (creamy and with actual meat), and the black truffle crab gnocchi. I had that night's special, which was a fantastic John Dory with a chardonnay lemon sauce. 

Some of the other \"little touches\" to make the experience better? The server actually served side dishes on our plates for us, and we received a follow up phone call a couple of days later to ensure our satisfaction. Very classy!

Expect a hit to your wallet: Three of us walked out of there at $600, though we did splurge on Grey Goose martinis (shaken table side), wine and lobster. I can assure you it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly and attentive staff, and an all around good atmosphere. The seafood was excellent, the filet was cooked properly, and the wine selection is good. The dining area is visually striking and the booth seating is quite comfortable. Prices are a bit on the high end, but not outrageous by any means."}
{"text":"Awesome what can I say!! Great food, fantastic service great atmosphere. Sit in the bar it is so worth the wait!! Ask for James the best server in the joint! James will not let you down!!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for dinner. Had already had the pleasure of dinning here several times before but this time got the seafood tower and was really impressed with the fresh, sweet and ice cold sea treasures adorning this tower.   I was so full that I couldn't fathom ordering an entree.  But there is always room for dessert.  Great service as you would expect.  Bar is quite the bore with the \"do you see me?  I'm one of the cool people, I have arrived\"  bullshit attitude.  Who you kidding?   Watch me leaving."}
{"text":"I took my best friend out for drinks and dessert for her birthday- after the appetizer which was actually good, we had a salad and decided to stop there.  We added a few drinks and wanted dessert.   Without asking us, our waitress brought a nicely decorated slice of chocolate cake?   We wanted to share the warm butter cake and would have gladly paid for it.   And while  it was nice of her to bring the chocolate cake,when I mentioned the warm butter cake, she made it a point to tell us she bought it for us??? Now we had to eat it or feel guilty.  She actually told us we could order the butter cake too but we aren't very big girls, coupled with the guilt trip we just went ahead and picked at the cake she brought.   Why would you tell your patrons you bought them something if for no other reason than to pad the tip?  I guess so they can't order what they really wanted?  I m still sort of bothered.

Dear Maestros,
Usually your staff is impeccable.  The service is spot on and the dessert is up to me to choose.  If you want to offer a complimentary dessert- leave the guilt trip, pad my tip- speech out of the friendly waitstaff banter.
The time spent with my girlfriend  was worth it, the food was fine but it's how you leave that people most remember and the end of our get together for drinks wasn't at all memorable in the way I had hoped.
Thanks for trying."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time dining at Mastro's Ocean Club.  Lanford was our waiter for the evening.  He was extremely personable and very knowledgeable about the menu.  We dined on Oysters Rockefeller,  Sea Bass, Scallops, Lobster/black truffle gnocchi and the Brussel sprouts.  Everything was wonderful.  We spoke to 3 of the on duty managers in passing: Nicholas, Brandon and Dan(?).  We have nothing but praise for this restaurant and all who work there.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been going to Ocean Club since it opened and have never been disappointed. My wife and I had the house salad which we split and it's always outstanding. Well worth the $17. 
We also split the Chilean Sea Bass on searing plates. $49. Never needed a knife. For a side we had the creamy spinach. 
It was my wife's birthday and we were comped a wonderful chocolate raspberry cake. 
Can't say enough about out service. We had a leisurely 3 hour dinner and were never rushed.

Went back to Ocean Club for my wife's birthday again last night. Service and food outstanding. Told the waiter we didn't want to rush and had a 2 hour dinner which was fabulous. 
Most restaurants loose quality over the years... not Ocean Club! A very special evening."}
{"text":"This review is purely for a stop at the bar, not a dining experience.  

On a hot summer night, my husband and I were walking down the strip, taking advantage of a few kid-free hours.  We were looking for something new and different to try when we walked past the Aria.  Just inside the attached shopping center and right off the strip, is Mastro's.  My husband has been wanting to try it out, but to be honest we weren't sure this was the right day because we were wearing shorts and sandals. 

We walked up and asked about the dress code.  Surprisingly they said, \"No problem!\" and pointed us inside and to the left when we asked about the bar.  

We walked in straight to the bar, which is a little small, with some tables just behind it.  Dining tables extend into a interesting architectural feature that has you eating suspended over the shopping center.

With a full bar, there are several cocktails and other beverages available, including a few signature ones.  They are pricey (like  $20 a drink), so make sure that you know that going in.  I like sweet stuff so I had a dream berry martini with a sugar rim. It was yummy.

The bartenders were very helpful and fun to chat with.

The cool thing about this place is it is definitely a celebrity hangout.  We were there during NBA summer league, so my husband saw Laker legend Magic Johnson and got a hug and a handshake out of him.  The staff likes to keep it low-key so we did not push for pics.

Stop by this cool spot and have a drink!  I'm hoping to come back for a meal some day.  You never know who you might run into!"}
{"text":"Dinner with group of 30 during a conference. Calamari & asparagus for warm up - hey I look forward to some tasty, sautéed/grilled asparagus! Oh, it was breaded & FRIED. No thanks. How bout taking two small sips of a $30 glass of scotch on the rocks, go to men's room & return to have your scotch...gone! How bout looking forward to some nice \"Pacific Swordfish\" then it comes & its way overcooked? 3 Stars as the wait staff worked hard. As for the food? Go to a Subway instead"}
{"text":"I had made reservations here for my wife's birthday and when we got there the place was crowded.  The hostesses explained the wait, and offered for us to have a drink in the lounge until our table was ready.  They kept checking in on us until we were ready to be seated.  

We started with two cups of coffee and the Dungeness Crab Cocktail.  The crab came out on a cup of dry ice that was smoking and was a very good presentation, as well as being extremely tasty.

For dinner my wife had the 8oz. Petite Filet and I had the Chilean Sea Bass.  The waiter, Piotr, explained that the sides are served family style and that we should share a couple.  We chose the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and the Steamed Broccoli.  My wife, when asked how she wanted her meat cooked, asked for it to be medium, Piotr explained that medium would still have some pink in the center, and sensing the way that she likes hers cooked, recommended medium plus.  When it came out it was cooked perfectly, and was the most tender steak that she has ever had.  My Sea Bass was cooked so it had a nice, crispy shell of the outside, but was milky and soft on the inside.  The Lobster Mashed Potatoes has spoiled me, now I find it hard to not expect that kind of perfection from all other potatoes.

After dinner they brought out a complimentary Chocolate Sin Cake for us to share with a birthday message written in sauce on the plate.  

Overall, this was an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant, and I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The prices are high, but you will get what you pay for.  My only regret is not being able to try the Warm Butter Cake everyone raves about, but I guess that means I have to go here again next time."}
{"text":"One of the worst steakhouse I've ever ate at.. Dirty dishes and knives to begin with. Had 3 of my friends order medium rare and it came out brown.. Told the manager, he had the chef to start a new order, and it came out again well done.. I was speechless. How do you mess up the order twice??? For a steakhouse this is pathetic. If your cooks can't cook steaks .. Please consider a new profession.."}
{"text":"The way the menu is designed this is really a place for 6 people or more. Many of the side dishes not to mention the entrees are enough for sharing. Our julienned vinegar and salt french fries could have been a side dish for a table of 6 without a problem. 
   We enjoyed the Rack of Lamb and Blackened Swordfish, both expertly cooked although the blackened fish had more than its' serving of salt in the seasoning. The twice baked potato was rockin' and we also loved the Brussel sprouts. Don't miss the butter cake which comes warm and a la mode. 
   The service was so amazing it felt like we were their only table."}
{"text":"......... I'm speechless... This place is fabulous! I ordered the New York Strip, and they did not disappoint. It was so tender... Usually just the filets are like butter, but believe me, my New York was like cool whip. The staff were fantastic, I believe our waiters name was Patrick... He was so kind and helpful, shoutout to him. We got a few sides and appetizers... We got escargot which was surprisingly good in its garlicky sauce, but I recommend eating with the pastry it comes with. We also ordered the vanilla shrimp which was so plump and fresh and probably some of the best shrimp I've ever had. Our waiter, Patrick, recommended the lobster mashed potatoes, boy was his recommendation on point, it was simply divine. And of course you have to have a green vegetable, so you just couldn't go wrong with steamed broccoli. Then after leisurely eating the main course for about 45 minutes, it was time for dessert... Their specialty is the warm butter cake, which we sadly did not get to experience, instead we devoured the chocolate sin cake. The chocolate was so rich and pure and topped with house made whipped cream and garnished with a mint leaf, but you simply couldn't go wrong with any dessert on the menu. Sadly you can't keep eating all night, it was time to go home with a big doggy bag. Until the next time, I'm sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent service
Excellent filet mignon prepared to perfection
The scallop potatoes are an absolute must and are creamy yet lightly crisp with spectacular flavor.  Broccoli side dish was huge and flavorful.

Creamed corn- another must try!

Cheesecake and pecan pie were huge and over the top.  A great way to wind down an excellent meal.

Silver Oak Napa Valley Cab is always a winner, but was marked up about 100 bucks way too much but won't hold against them because I bought it anyway.


Again-  perfect service and a well run establishment."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant when we are in Vegas!! Now this is a high end steakhouse. You don't want to go to Vegas and not eat here. 

Their steaks are delicious!! Cooked exactly how you like. The mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese are must haves!!
Can't really say anything about the seafood as I don't eat it. But if you want  a great steak with some delicious sides and some good cocktails with an overall 5 star dining experience then you will like Mastros. 

I look forward to eating here again on my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"they exceeded my high expectations...the seafood tower was a great start, and you have to have the butter cake to finish off your meal...had the Bone-in Ribeye and it was cooked to perfection, medium rare warm all the way through...on the down side if you are looking for a quiet place...it's not"}
{"text":"Excellence in all matters...music, bar, ambience, decor, staffing...and food!  5 stars for GM Nick who came to our rescue when a full house prevented us from ordering cocktails ....came with a server who handily shook 2 martini shakers who handed us our Cosmo & martini while we edited to be seated with the 2050+ guests.  Best service ever, our server Brandon was attentive, charming funny & knowledgeable ...loved this restaurant! Bar is set so high!"}
{"text":"I usually go to City Hall but wanted to try Ocean Club. The food and service was outstanding as expected from a Mastro's restaurant. My guests also enjoyed their dinners and dessert (can't forget the warm butter cake- if only for the fresh whipped cream!) The food was cooked perfectly, the dishes came out together and everything was enjoyable. Love the lobster mashed potatoes.

Great location but a little harder to park- Valet, it is easier."}
{"text":"This time I had a plan: share a martini and save room for the warm butter cake!

Since our server, Leonard, kindly allowed me to split a martini with my friend, I actually remember my second visit to Mastro's in its entirety: from the amazingly addictive pretzel rolls, to the heirloom tomato and Campagna burrata salad, to the filet mignon (served with Bearnaise sauce, upon request), to the lobster mashed potatoes--and, finally, the famed warm butter cake.

This cake, alone, is worth 5 stars! The warm butter cake portion was more than enough for the three of us, served with a drizzle of berry coulis, sliced strawberries, a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting on top, and, in a separate bowl, enough whipped cream to frost a double-layer cake.

My first spoonful filled my mouth with warm brown sugar-sweet goodness, with the cake texture somewhere between a Genoise and a pound cake. The cake was wonderful on its own but we couldn't help but top our tastes with the whipped cream. We were so full from our meals (most likely due to that extra order of pretzel rolls) that, sadly, we couldn't quite finish the warm butter cake.

I plan to return for an all-carb meal next time: pretzel rolls and warm butter cake!"}
{"text":"This place is just hands down exquisite! White Salmon!!!!!! Start to finish I can't say a bad thing about this place. The decor is impressive, and the drinks awesome. They have a $3600.00 Seafood Tower appetizer if you have that kinda cash. I gotta say though if they ever offer it to you as a special \"White Salmon\"...  Get it! It was like candy. Never had anything like it. UNREAL!!!!! Now I'm hungry...."}
{"text":"Drinks and dessert with with the girls during a Vegas trip. The warm butter cake with fresh fruit was so delicious, melt in your mouth amazing! and the fresh strawberries went together perfectly with it. The fresh whipped cream  that came with it was HUGE like a mountain of whipped cream...way too much we only used like two spoon-fulls."}
{"text":"I'm sad right now. I wanted to like this place so badly. I wanted to have the positive experience others did and be able to happily write about it on yelp. Hubby and I went last weekend; got all dressed up, left the kids at home and took the date car. People watching was great, service was great, even our table location was great. The bar area was great. I loved the atmosphere. Did not mind it being dark at all because it was so cool inside. 
What was NOT great? Pretzel bread was a little stale but butter, lots of it, helped. The seafood tower was impressive, but the seafood adorning it was not so much. The Clear Lobster roll was outright INEDIBLE. Mushy, no flavor, disappointing.
My mambo salad was passable but nothing great.  When I asked for shrimp on top, after hearing so many great reviews about the shrimp, they gladly obliged. BUT when it came, they were overcooked and rubbery. WAH for me. Husband's steak was very good. He was gloating for sure. 
We got two sides, the Crab Truffle Gnocchi and the peas. The gnocchi was decent but I really could only have a couple of bites due to the intense richness with nothing to offset it. The peas, while super fresh, were SWIMMING in oil. Seriously, they took great peas and drowned them to death in a sad, sad oil lake. 
The butter cake was superb. Nothing but fond memories of that. 
So, we spent a small fortune for a meal with one (for me) or two (for hubby) great points. 
I will not be going back. I will not be recommending. We live in Mesa, and were the first of our circle of influence to go and I am devastated to be the one steering people away due to such a lackluster first showing. 
I wonder what went wrong. So many other yelpers just love this place."}
{"text":"A very nice man from Ocean Club at Kierland personally contacted me to make things right. He gave me his name to use when I make the reservation so I can be assured that the dining experience will be special. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Mastros Ocean Club. The food is nothing less than superb. I have been to the Costa Mesa, Newport, and now the Vegas location. This is by far my favorite restaurant/steak house. The mats are perfectly seasoned. The appetizers are all delicious. The desserts, we'll all I will say is Butter Cake!

The ambiance is very elegant, and the staff Is on top of everything. I highly recommend this fine restaurant. I do highly advise the bill will not be cheap, but you pay for what you get. They offer a military discount, which is 30% off the bill. Another great way the restaurant takes care of their customers."}
{"text":"Lobster mashed potatoes and butter cake, need I say more. This place will change your life, it did for me. I took my wife here on our first date and I proposed to her at this place. Ocean Club management surprised us with complimentary champagne and gave us the best service in the industry. I have stopped in wearing golf shorts and other times dressed up for special events. Ocean Club never disappoints. The servers are great and the management is exceptional. Best place in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Decided to celebrate my husbands birthday with family and friends. We love good food and great drinks. We were hoping for both. 
We were a party of 12 and the atmosphere was fun and loud and that was perfect for our celebration. 
My drink arrived in a chipped glass (the drink was awesome) so the waiter brought me a new drink and a new glass however the drink he brought back was awful. So that was bummer. We all ordered something different and got tons of sides for the table.  I thought I was safe getting the steak and it was over cooked which was a bummer. Everyone that got fish was disappointed in its flavor and appearance. Desserts were nice the starters were good and the creamed corn didn't disappoint. It's our last visit I'm afraid. We've been there a dozen times and the last two times just weren't good. So sad to see a once great place not so great."}
{"text":"OMG Mastro's is delicious! If you're looking for some fine dining in Vegas, I highly recommend this place. The food, service, and ambience were absolutely amazing. We came here for my friend's birthday dinner and it was the perfect event! We were a large group (7 people) so we ordered family style and surprisingly the bill wasn't that bad. The bill came out to $300 with alcohol and (free!) dessert. I recommend getting several plates and sharing. 

I highly recommend their truffle Alaskan crab gnocchi! I think it was a seasonal special but I hope they keep it on the menu. It was one of the best dishes I've had! They also served us really good rosé. I normally don't care for rosé (I prefer red wine) but their version was refreshing. 

For dessert, they serve this delicious butter cake! It was enough for the whole group. 

Definitely worth checking out if you want to switch it up from the ratchet scene."}
{"text":"Obviously Mastro's is really expensive but it's very much worth it. This is in Vegas so my friends and I didn't have time for dinner so we decided to go to the bar and have some appetizers.

Chopped Salad
Calamari
Lobster Mashed Potatoes

The chocolate covered strawberries are ridiculously good.

We ended up back at the bar the following night to do it all again. I wish I could remember both bartender's names but I can't. They were both great.

If you don't mind paying for great food the this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My favorite spot in Vegas :) I come to Mastro's every year for my b-day. Food is amazing, lamb is my favorite. The best part is the butter cake, it's the best thing ever Best people, food, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I ordered a kansas city steak (bone in) rib eye. Ordered lobster mac &cheese, scallop mash potatoes, creamed spinach for sides.  For a group of 6, one side dish only feeds a lot of people.

The service is superb, server always checked on us, got dessert complimentary since it was all of our first time there. We got lucky that night.

I would definitely return. I've visited the Mastros in Beverly hills, California location and it is also good food, service in vegas was even better though."}
{"text":"A couple buddies and I decided to come out and try out the Vegas Mastros after a long day of playing tables. Got seating right away without having to make an appointment,  and service was very professional.  After we received our steak it was hands down the best we ever had and would come out for dinner again on our next visit."}
{"text":"This is one of the experiences you must enjoy. A true fine dining experience. The manager Phil is a true professional.  From the time you arrive it is first class.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this one when we first sat down. I've been lucky enough to eat at 3 other locations, all in Southern California, but this was is different in that you're inside a mall. When I sat down I was facing Louis Vuitton and that was odd. Initially I thought it was going to have a \"food court\" feel to it. I was wrong, as soon as our waiter and pretzel bread arrived, we forgot all about the mall. Also worth noting, you never hear any pedestrian traffic. No weird mall conversations to ruin the atmosphere. The whole thing works brilliantly. Pretzel bread, home run. My wife always orders some smokey bubbling drink that is always from to watch and I get the same theatrics with the shrimp. Dry ice smoke shows make everything better. As always, the people watching is fantastic. If you're in Vegas and want a break from the noise and congestion, stop by, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"We recently had some great friends take us out for a luxurious dinner night.  we went to their favorite place in the whole world.  this was Mastro Ocean Club in Scottsdale.  We started with the bread they bring out (Pretzel Bread).  3 baskets later. AMAZING!!! My wife had a 3 LB lobster and I got the Steak.  Both were best ever quality.  the wait staff was also best ever.  I can't express enough how PERFECT this place is.  don't forget the butter cake for desert."}
{"text":"The filet was so tender I could have cut it with my thumb.  I found nothing wrong with this place."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is weak. I've been to several mastros restaurants and this one (I've been at least 4 times) is just not good. I go there because my clients love the seafood towers. Last time I was there I sent the super-hyped NY Steak back. The thing was way over cooked, dry, and probably one of the worst NY I've had. I cook better using Choice beef from the grocery store. The service is overly attentive and way too salesy. It's a show they put on and I'm not impressed. But, I guess for Scottsdale, it's probably one of the better places around. Bring a fat wallet because it is EXPENSIVE. Oh, and watch out for the cougars at the bar. This place has as many as Javiers in Newport Beach."}
{"text":"This is the type of Resturant that truly deserves five stars. I went with a \"difficult to please\" family member and our waiter was fantastic. The food was on point and the wine selection was wonderful. Every staff member is there to help you enjoy the experience and we were all quite impressed."}
{"text":"Extreme Rude people who work here. Had a reservation and still waited 45 mins  my steak was over cooked and they didn't have lobster.."}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for my Birthday. I read the reviews and most of them were pretty good. We got there at 5:15 pm and were taken to the main dining room. They sat us at a table with one long booth against the wall and chairs across. We knew if they sat someone on either side of us, we would have no privacy. Halfway into our meal, they sat people on either side of us. Not a big fan of eating with strangers. The restaurant was dimly lit which we both like but the seating arrangements ruined that. 

I ordered the Lobster Tail with a $13 side of Asparagus. The tail was so dry, I had to soak it in the butter just to get some moisture. My husband had the bone in filet which he liked. We did say something about my Lobster And they offered to get me the double tails instead. I didn't want to wait seeing my husband would have been finished with his dinner before the tails would have come. 

We had the Chocolate Layer Cake for desert and it was about 5\" tall and looked like a half of a cake. It was good but way to rich. We had a few bites and had to take the rest home. 

We would give them another try only if we had a more private table and the $87 Lobster Tail wasn't dry. Our Waiter Nick was attentive and nice. Expect to spend at least $200 per couple."}
{"text":"For starters I ordered Boston clam chowder, then went in on the big joy list. Lobster mashed potatoes, 22oz bone in ribeye, crab legs, Chilean sea bass, salmon, and sautéed spinach. Topped off with warm butter cake. That was the line up for today's father's day dinner at Mastro's Ocean Club.  First time here and what a great experience. As the live band played in the background the ambiance was fantastic.  This location is very similar to Mastro's city hall; however they have more seafood selections. Yesssss mister!"}
{"text":"Lets start with dessert - best I have ever tasted. I had the Butter Cake - which is served with a huge VAT of fresh whipped cream- wow! Second the cake is warm and moist and salty - yes SALTY! Surrounded with strawberries and orange slices - this dessert surely made me smile. 
The live music was amazing! I rocked out all night to a lovely mix of great tunes!
The martinis were cold and awesome, the crab cocktail was superb and the Blackened Salmon from the Columbia River was perfect. 

Overall a pretty good experience. I will certainly go again. 

I was purposely not going here because they don't do a happy hour - but I was drug there by a date (I know, poor me...lol) and have since become a fan!"}
{"text":"The service at Mastros was phenomenal. The food was amazing as well, the Sea Bass was some of the best fish I have ever had in my life, the filet was great and the sides were delicious as well. 

Food and service was definitely 5 stars, the reason I gave it 4 is because of the Mojito that I ordered. It was on the cocktail menu, and they have a full bar so I expected it to be good. It was really watery and frankly not very tasty. Expected more from the bar, but would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I came here for our office Xmas dinner and as an office full of foodies, we get around to a lot of nice restaurants. Mastro's Ocean Club was hands down the best place we've gone. The ambiance was very classy and the staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Half of the restaurant is a traditional dine-in interior, but you also have the option to sit in a large wooden structure that resembles a nest. It's a little wild, but it gives you something to talk and post pictures about. The food is top notch. Like seriously top notch. The fish is cooked perfectly and most dishes can be prepared in several ways. My sea bass was baked with a herb rub and a parmesan crust, so the bite was crispy on the outside but firm and juicy on the inside; all the bases were covered. The sides are served family style and are a great way to experience the whole menu; my personal favorites were the brussel sprouts and the lobster Mac and cheese. I'm really glad I got a chance to stop in and look forward my my next visit!"}
{"text":"My first thought is, 'it was ok'. My wife agrees. While we had a great service, everything was just 'ok'.  We have been to many nice places in Vegas and nothing here 'wowed' us. overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Completely disappointed by Maestro's restaurant in Las Vegas.  I read such wonderful reviews on yelp and was really looking forward to it. My husband and I went there for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. I made reservations a month before the big day and requested to have a bottle of champagne upon our arrival.  

We ordered the beef Carpaccio to start.  It took about 20 minutes for them to take that initial order and another 20-30 minutes for them to bring it out.  The beef Carpaccio was SO salty and came with a weird Caesar salad combination on top as aside. The dressing of the salad ruined the flavor of the meat if the salt didn't already to it. 

As our main entrees we ordered a petite filet and lamp chops. DRY, DRY, DRY! I'm sorry but if we are paying over +$50 a plate we expect mouth watering tender meat.  That wasn't the case at all. So disappointed. 

To end the evening we were so disappointed by the slow service, the bad appetizer and unsatisfactory entrée we didn't even want dessert. As the waiter brings the +$200 check he just says Happy Anniversary and walks away.  No complimentary dessert or glass of champagne as most places would have done. Oh well...I will go back to SAGE inside Aria which is the BEST steak house I have ever been too."}
{"text":"This restaurant, just like all the others I have been fortunate to enjoy serves up the best food as well as the staff could not be better."}
{"text":"This place has the best food in AZ.  Perfect food and perfect service.  The butter cake for desert is worth the calories.  The best entres are the ribeye and sea bass.  I would ask for the sea bass to be slightly cooked just a tad on the + side so its not raw.  Shrimp cockail is great too.  Crab claws seemed overpriced to me.

Oh...the pretzels w/ butter are amazing but a gut bomb.  So in summary, best food in town but be ready to take in 3000 calories if you want to take it all in:)"}
{"text":"Was a bit dissapointed on the quality of the steak and sides... Seafood was good though. Specialty cocktails sounded better than it tasted. Butter cake was pretty good but not something that will bring me back here again."}
{"text":"Expected to be wowed but was slightly disappointed. Food was good decent but it wasn't amazing. This restaurant was more of a checked box won't be coming back. But the service was great, everyone was friendly and the prices were decent."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner at Mastro's! We started with the Seafood tower with crab and oysters. Definitely delicious! We had the calamari which was also lovely. For our entree we had shared the wagyu tomahawk steak with gorgonzola mac n cheese and creamed corn. For a tomahawk given it's size it was actually cooked quite well at a medium rare. The creamed corn was actually the best I've ever had so buttery and creamy felt totally decadent! Service was excellent and personal. We went with our 2 young kids and the staff took care of us all. Will definitely go back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant many times and it NEVER disappoints me 

The steak is always cooked to perfection I always get medium rare and it's always on point  

I ALWAYS get oysters I'm a huge oyster fan have been for years 

Also ordered the shrimp cocktail seems weird when they bring them out it's only 3 but they r really big :) 

Also order the Alaskan king claws very big and lots of meat 

Also ordered the salmon which was cooked blacked very good as well

This place is always on point never been disappointed if you go here and u don't like it there's just something wrong with u"}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I celebrated our 3 year anniversary we each got a filet mignon steak which was great along with the lobster mashed potatoes, but bad thing was there were some lobster shells that I bit into.  Waiter was quite nice to comp us with a free butter cake desert which was delicious!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and I swear it gets better and better! Ribeye with a side of Lobster? There are no words!! Enjoy..."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club is one of the high end dining places that has opened up in the last year or so at Crystals which is part of City Place.

Technically speaking Mastro's is a chain, though it doesn't carry the chain vibe.  The locations of the handful of Mastro's that exist live in high end cities like Scottsdale, AZ, Beverly Hills, CA and Chicago, IL.  This location in Las Vegas was tagged with the words \"Ocean Club\" to show off the fact that not only do they have steak but a large selection of seafood too.

Steak is what Mastro's have built themselves up as and if you are thinking about dining here I would suggest the steak.  They are famous for firing their meats in an oven that burns hotter than 1100 degrees F.  I ordered the bone in ribeye that I split with my friend.  We did the usual recommendation of medium rare and in my opinion it came out perfect, though it was too bloody for her and she sent hers back to be cooked more.  

Of course Mastro's is a la carte and buyer beware the sides are HUGE.  One side order can be spit by 3 people.  We ordered the grilled brussel sprouts and they brought them out piping hot still in the skillet and put the skillet on the table.  

Wine selection is wonderful.  Though the food is pricey the wine prices are affordable with decent bottles for only $27 though they go way up in price.

Dessert was a chef's creation at this Mastro's in Vegas (executive chef Wayne Schumaker) which is the signature warm butter cake.  This is a large piece of butter cake that has a sugar crust that is baked hot along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a pile of homemade whipped cream.  OMG ridiculous good but again could be shared with like, 5 people.  

The only major downside to Mastro's is the music.  They have a live piano bar that you think would play soft, classy music like jazz or piano but instead you get very loud, karaoke type performances by an older man and woman (ages 60+) who use an iPad connected to the piano to sing modern and past day pop music such as Pink, Katy Perry, and even Foster the People's \"Pumped Up Kicks\".  If Mastro's would lose the cheesy, loud, awful music they would go to 5 stars.  

Bring headphones and enjoy a nice dinner."}
{"text":"Sat at bar two nights in a row.  Food excellent except maybe a bit of minus for chopped up wedge salad but seafood is best in lv.  Very service oriented, pleasant and attractive bartenders.  Never rushed or pressured to drink or eat more than I wanted.   Would definitely return."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the door we were treated like royalty.  The staff was very attentive.  The ambiance was very appealing. Almost a throwback to the 50's. We tried the shrimp cocktail for a starter and were warned about the horseradish.  WOW the shrimp was fantastic and the horseradish was amazing. The bread was very tasty. We tried the scallops and they were quite possibly the best I've ever had.  We also had the filet and it was cooked to perfection.  For sides we had the sautéed wild mushrooms. They were amazing.  Overall this was a dining experience worth every penny. I HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"This was a 5 star anniversary dinner for us!  Amazing!

Location:  You cannot beat dining in a \"tree house\" in the Crystals Mall.  Very cool!  I loved the live music that I could hear from the lower levels of the mall.

Service:  Mike R was our server.  He was completely patient and totally helpful.  He gave us a taste of two different wines when we were trying to decide on a bottle.  He was great with any questions we had.  Great guy and a huge asset to the restaurant.

Food:  The bread basket was amazing and beautifully presented.  Wish I could have tried everything without filling up before dinner!   Beef carpaccio, bone in filet, ribeye (bone in), au gratin potaotes, and compliementary butter cake (for our anniversary!).  I loved every bite of our meal.  The food was superb.

Drink:  As mentioned, Mike R let us sample the wines, and we selected the Earthquake, which he stated was from a boutique winery.  Huge thumbs up!!!!!  Next visit will include one of the cool looking cocktails!

This was a great, great meal!  Mastos hit everything on the mark, and have two satisfied customers who can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service, quality of food with only one drawback.  It was very noisy the night that we were there and was told a holiday party was going on close to restaurant."}
{"text":"So disappointed. I did not enjoy the experience at all. Sea salt fries were burnt, chocolate cake was super dry, and my filet was pretty mediocre. the steaks are so much more flavorful and better prepared at The Capital Grille. The cocktail was the best part of my night. Not to mention the waiter spilled the wine on the table while attempting to serve. Maybe the one in BH or Malibu is better. Idk..."}
{"text":"Five star, five star, five star everything!! Their Lobster mash is the single best side I've had in my life. The fillet was stupid good and the service was excellent. This was my 5th time at Mastros and I will come here every time I'm in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"the service of course is great. We had the 12 oz bone-in filet (in the $50's range) and the 10oz filet ($48). if you like your steak tasting soft like butter it's best to order it medium rare. It comes in a 200 degree plate so it'll continue to cook the steak. 

for sides, we had the lobster mashed potato ($39)-it was delicious, it was a bit salty for me  but my party liked it. 

cream spinach-bland- i think i had better at Lawry's 

Gorgonzola mac and cheese-best eat it while it's hot, once it's cold it's really bland.
 
the sides are generous, we order one of each  and it was more than enough for my party of 6.  We did have some appetizers prior. 
  the basket of bread of abundant- prezel bread, garlic Parmesan bread, olive bread and some other stuff."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a baller...

I LOVE Mastro's.  They do it right.  Top quality service, top quality drinks, top quality food.  For the first time I had the oysters here, and they were ... AWESOME.

We walked in, no-reservation, found a table in the bar area, watched the Lakers lose to OKC (yes!) and had another swank experience.  The huge wooden design thing-thing dining area that opens up/sits over the mall provides for a great atmosphere also.. (ref pic)

The place is all that."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh seafood, great ambiance, & exceptional service you need to check out Mastro's Ocean Club. Their seafood is flown in fresh daily. If you order a martini, you not only get a full martini glass, but a half full shaker as well. Even the bread basket is delicious! (I have a soft spot for the pretzel bread). The halibut is delicious, but the vanilla battered lobster tail is my absolute favorite. Like flavorful mashed potatoes? Order the Mastro's mashed potatoes! The sweet potato steak fries are delicious as well. Looking for a great steak instead? No worries. They serve the same great steaks that they serve at Mastro's Steakhouse & City Hall Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"For the most part, a pretty good experience.
The gin martini was very good (it was practically two drinks).  It \"worked\" very well.
I've had better (more garlic/butter) escargot but these were pretty good.  Lobster bisque was more than acceptable. Ocean Club salad was tasty and cold but they use iceberg lettuce (really?).  Mussels were decent.  Bone Marrow was interesting but way overpriced.
Sea Bass was nice, light tasty.  Blackened grouper was pretty good.  They served both the scallops and the lamb underdone.  They promptly took both back to the kitchen and when they re-served them (just three minutes later), the scallops were acceptable but the lamb was completely awesome.  The lamb was hot with the proper amount of crust and perfectly medium rare. (Why didn't they do that the first time?) The lamb was the winner, for sure.
(I glanced at other tables' filets ... too small.  It didn't look appetizing.)
Brussels sprouts were delicious.  The lobster mashed potatoes were too liquidy.  What WAS that liquid?  They totally should've been thicker.
For dessert (ugh, we were so full but we just HAD to have dessert) was the cherry crisp.  Tasty but needed more cherry.  The ice cream was nice and the freshly-made whipped cream was awesome.  Plenty for four people.
With tip (including two drinks and everything mentioned, above) for four people, the check came to $480 (incl. $80 tip).
Yes, it was overpriced but it was a fun experience, very nice service (including lots of amenities in the men's bathroom) and the food was pretty good, overall.  Not sure we'd go back (because it's so expensive) but certainly nice when you're on vacation and want to splurge a little."}
{"text":"The design of the restaurant itself is an art and worth to check it out. Maestro is always one of my favorite steakhouse in both LA and LV. Wagu and lobster bisque is strongly recommended."}
{"text":"oscar style filet minion ... best I've had and I'm a BIG steak snob from the midwest.  Seemed very social and good place for an adult crowd to grab drinks.  I can't speak to any of the other food but this was for sure as good as it gets."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to Mastro's twice, once for work and most recently for my birthday. 

1. Service is good.  

2. Caesar salad was over dressed and had too much cheese.  Gavin Degraw was also eating at the restaurant that night and shared the same feedback on the Caesar salad.  

3. Steak is the reason that this rating is 4 stars instead of 5.  We have had far better steak at Craftsteak. But the side of mushrooms that you can order with the steak is sooo good!

4. Butter cake was a great dessert but there chocolate cake was very dry.  Both you could share with someone else.

5. The lemon drop is one of the best I have ever had.  I will order it every time I am in Vegas. The wine list is also reasonable and has a lot of good choices."}
{"text":"Highly recommend Mastro's...
Service: 5+ stars 
Exceptional service from Katie. Katie did an amazing job recommending the food, specialty drinks, and wine. She was very knowledgable on the entire menu. Katie's  attention to detail was on point! 

Food: 
Halibut/blackened: amazing. Very tasty and nice texture
Bone In Filet: amazing: thickness and quality was great
Sides: Very large portions.... Loaded baked potato: very tasty. Creamed Spinach: best ever had
Dessert: cheesecake. Comped for birthday...very good homemade new york style cheesecake. 

Drinks: great value for drink. Oversized portions pf wine and double liquor on martinis, plus an amazing selection of both. 

Overall: best dinner/drinks/service in Vegas. Will definitely be going back....especially to try the butter cake Katie recommended!"}
{"text":"Went to celebrate our anniversary.  Although pricey, the terrific food and service are worth the extra bucks.  Shared a large filet, 2 orders of lobster tails, and sides among four people.  Everything was delicious.  Portions are large, so it's easy to do something like this (which also cut the cost a bit).  When in Vegas, this is definitely a must-go for a great eating experience.  Joe, our server, was great fun and very attentive.  Everyone at the restaurant has a friendly NOT snooty attitude that is delightful to find in such an outstanding restaurant."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with any Mastro's restaurant.  I've been to 4 Mastros in California, 1 in Las Vegas and now 2 in Scottsdale and it's always been the same great quality and service.    Their cold seafood platter is dynamite and the server is cognizent of how many items to order for the amount of people in the party.  Their Ice Berg Wedge is an excellent starter and I always get the Petite Filet Medium.  The steak is pretty thick and ordering it Medium Rare can be red and cold in the middle.  

Whenver I travel and I know that there will be a Mastro's, the restaurant will be on my list to visit first."}
{"text":"This was a very unpleasant experience. We made reservation for the treehouse, when we got there, they said the treehouse was not available. So they tried to put us at a table, that was so close to the other table, that the people eating would have to get up so would be able to sit. I had taken the day off from work, this was my birthday dinner, that I never got to have. We left do to the fact we didn't want to interrupt the other people from eating. The bottom line is that if you want a great meal and great service, go to the Wynn. I usually go there, but I thought I would try something new, big mistake."}
{"text":"We went there for Valentine's Day dinner this evening. First thing we noticed was an $8 valet charge. Upon arriving inside the restaurant it was very cramped and the tables were too close together. Possibly they were trying to fit more people in for Valentine's Day. This didn't make it quite as romantic as it could be. I couldn't even sit on one side of the table and where I did sit I elbowed the waiters a few times due to the tight space. My wife wasn't comfortable that the bathroom had attendants. 
The bread was good. My wife had the Mambo salad and it was basically iceberg lettuce with a plop of dressing. No vegetables at all. Rather expensive too. The fish was very good and cooked well. The side dishes were very good. They treated us well and the service was good. In the end we both thought it was rather expensive and we were paying for a name.  Most likely first and last visit."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed.  We have visited Ocean Club many times in the past with good food and service.  Our last visit was to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.  Sadly, the steaks were severely overcooked and tasteless.  The following day we received an email from Ocean Club requesting a review.  I replied indicating that the $300.00 meal was a complete disappointment, especially since I had informed the restaurant in advance that this was a very special occasion.  Ocean Club did not even bother to respond to my email; guess they are seeking only good reviews and validation.  Our last visit for sure."}
{"text":"This place is first class.  The server was awesome.  Second time eating here, got the black truffle crab gnocchi both times.  Out of the park good.

The service is top notch And the steaks are excellent.  Good place for a group."}
{"text":"I followed Peter H.'s advice and was so happy I did.  The seafood tower was amazing.  The tower can be any thing from the raw bar you'd like to create.  I let the waiter create it for us.  It included, Alaskan king crab legs, lobster, oyster, carved crab meat, jumbo shrimps....  They were all very fresh and cooked,except the oyster.  

I had the lobsters bisque which was excellent.  The wedge salad was good but nothing special.  For the entree, I ordered rib eye steak, medium, with lobster mashed potatoes.  The rib eye was sooooo tender with great flavor.  The lobster mashed potatoes was unique and best tasting mashed potatoes I've had.  There was a good amount of lobster meat inside.

I tried to taste my friend's prime rib, which was not as good as my rib eye.  I did not have a chance to taste the dessert since we were all so full.  I thought the setting in the terrace was a bit informal not compatible with the price charged for the dinner.  I'd definitely recommend sitting in the tree house.  The seafood tower cost more than  $200 by itself.  The rib eye steak was $52.  The mashed potatoes was $38, but a good amount was given.  If you plan on going, you should plan for $75 to $100 per person.  The service was a bit slow but very good attitude.  Oh, be prepared to pay to $2 tip to the restroom attendant each time you use it."}
{"text":"Well we kept hearing about the lobster mash  potatoes so we had to see for ourselves and it was amaze balls the steak was pretty good not as good as Ruth's Chris but good but the dessert was really good the whip creme I could eat all day"}
{"text":"My first thought when seated was, \"It's a good thing all of these world class stores aren't doing any business because it sure takes the edge off a high-dining experience along the mall food court railing\". Our table felt like a satellite location for a sparkling contemporary version of daddy's classic steak house. And we weren't even seated in the satellite (you'll get it if you visit). It just seemed surreal for a \"room\" with such distinguishing attributes. I won't hold that against them, much.

It was just my son and I that visited to celebrate his 21st. Matt was our dining guide and he was fun. Not like, \"let's have a Vegas night!\", fun. Just that he carried his demeanor well and kept his smile on. He was very, very consistent in that his presentation to each of the three tables nearby was identical, and specific. He was meticulous to ensure accuracy and satisfaction.

We were completely impressed by the young lady and gentleman entertaining the room. We later learned that it was their first night at Mastro's. Their acoustics in that challenging environment are absolute perfection and their talents are superior.  

We went light on the openers which were supplemented by an abundant variety of stellar bread choices. My son is All-American in his need for a Calamari appetizer. It was the best we'd ever had, and maybe will. I had the Ocean Club Salad and, again, maybe the best complete salad I've ever enjoyed. My son ordered the Bone-In KC Strip a little less than medium and he dubbed it The Crown Jewel of his steak experiences. He couldn't finish it and he finishes everything. I asked for the Bone-In Ribeye. Matt helped me herd descriptives into a perfectly cooked finish. I'm still thinking it's the fact that I live in Colorado, where even onions and garlic sometimes have difficulty offering flavor, but if it's possible to have too much natural flavor in a steak, it happened. I'm taking accountability on that one, because it's not Mastro's fault I live at high altitude. This was a huge steak and I hardly dented it. We sided up a strong contender for best garlic mashed, which we carried out more of than we ate. So we get this this lovely shopping bag, consistent with the elevated neighborhood, to carry our midnight snack down the strip with. 

I have so many reasons to go 5 star all over this place and fractions of thoughts about why I wouldn't. Those fractions, the bulk of which are carried by the food court railing ambiance, add up to one. And I won't insult Matt because I liked him.

When I return in May, I might just take the other half of the family because I can't go wrong on this one."}
{"text":"This review is for drinks only. Expresso martini and bananas fosters was amazing. You get one drink in your glass and the shaker with one more drink inside. Simply fabulous. Waitress and bartender were very nice and welcoming. I will be back next time."}
{"text":"I want to say that I'm a frequent diner at the Mastro's in costa mesa as well as beverly hills. 

The service there trumps the vegas experience. Disappointing. At one point the server dropped some of the gnocchi on my lap as he was serving it onto my plate. He knew because I reacted unfavorably since I had some pretty nice pants on. Not a single apology. 


meh. 

I don't hold it against you Mastro's... you're still my 2nd favorite place to eat in orange county :D"}
{"text":"High end but very good. Expect to spend $150 - $200 per couple. My wife and I tried the Lobster Bisque, Chilean Sea Bass, Garlic Mash potatoes and chocolate cake for desert. Sides are large and can be easily shared. Overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Food is well portioned and always excellent . The lobster mash potatoes are delicious and are highly recommended. The horseradish is one of the best I have ever had . Definitely one that clears  your nostrils:)  My husband and I dine their every year for our anniversary."}
{"text":"Go for the entertainment (people watching), the large bar area, the drinks, the bread basket, the SEAFOOD, the live music (albeit las vegas cheezy), and the BUTTER CAKE.

Standouts:
SEAFOOD TOWER, Shrimp cocktail, Rib Eye, Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Mastros Mashed Potatoes, Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese, Green Beans and Almonds, and again the Butter Cake

Service is great except for the bar area but if it's not packed and if you can get seated sit at the bar area!  There's often live piano playing but if that's not your cup of tea the people watching is um entertaining at the least."}
{"text":"Oh boy, where do I start?

I made reservations for my fiance here last Saturday night :) It was his birthday, and so I wanted to take him out. We were in Vegas celebrating, and seeing that this place had high ratings, I took him here to try it out. The restaurant itself is inside a mall, and though we didn't get seated in the treehouse looking part, it was still a pleasant visit. It was our first time dining at ANY Mastro's restaurant, and definitely won't be our last! We got a waiter named Tim (Timothy), and he has got to be one of the best waiters we've ever had. He was very informative and was extremely nice. He showed us the different menus and helped us choose. I decided on the chilean sea bass. It was sooo good! The flavor was on point, and it was a perfect portion size. My fiance ordered the filet for himself, and his was overcooked, but they knew right away after he received it. Dan asked him if he wanted to switch it for a new one, but he said it was fine, and ate it anyways. He liked the flavor and was genuinely fine with it and didn't think it was really a big deal. We also ordered calamari as an appetizer, and a side of sweet potato fries. (Which was family sized, for sharing.. but we didn't know!) The calamari was awesome. We ended up only being able to eat about 10 fries out of that giant pile.. lol. We were too full! A different waiter served us sprite and ended up spilling it all over my fiance's shoulder.. yikes. They did help him clean it up though. In the end, my fiance got a warm butter cake as his birthday gift :D yay! It was so delicious, we ate it all.. despite the fact that we were super full! We were also given complementary wine for the steak being overcooked and for the sprite spill. Now THAT's excellent customer service, and if Vegas wasn't so far, I'd come back more often. I'll miss this place :( Hope the one in Newport is just as professional! But I know if we were in Vegas visiting, this spot will be one of the first places I'd go to eat at. Thanks for the wonderful experience Mastro's! :) Stay gold."}
{"text":"For this type of a place, the music totally sucks sorry! Used to be \"good\"
At least better then this! . No range in their voices or good performers. For this caliber of establishment, it is very surprising your entertainment is his poor when every thing else is so expensive ! Bring quality musicians please!! It is Friday night and this is Monday night talent if at all!
Sorry for being this straightforward there is not much in terms of live music in town and this is simply very poor!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so amazing. I can't get enough of their delicious 8 0Z filet mignon, garlic mash potatoes, and macaroni and cheese. Of course you can't just stop at the dinner you have to order s butter cake for dessert. I don't know how or what they do to make this cake so moist and buttery but it's addicting. The butter cake also comes with home made whipped cream made in house. My boyfriend loves their bone in New York steak 22 0Z it's so big. The complimentary bread basket is a nice touch also you get different varieties of bread while waiting for your food. I recommend getting your steak butterflied and well done. The steak always comes out on a hot plate sizzling. Maestros is becoming a Friday or Saturday date night habit for me and my boyfriend. We always get Stephen as our server he rocks he's so awesome. He's taken a nectar note of what we like and always remembers how we like it prepared. He's the best server hands down. For drinks I recommend the lemon drop martini it comes out ice cold and has smoke on top and it bubbles and makes a crackling sound. My boyfriend drinks the Maestros Margarita. The ambiance is beautiful we always request to sit in the dining area which is inside this beautiful caged area over looking the crystals mall attached to Aria. If you haven't tried Maestros you are in for a major treat. It's pricey but worth it. You. Any put a price on good quality food and service."}
{"text":"I love Ocean Club! We have eaten here many times as we live very close. The service is attentive and what should be expected from a fine dining restaurant. I swear I could just live off the pretzel bread and butter cake! They have an extensive wine list and their cocktails are also very generous portions. The lobster mashed potatoes are delicious and last time I was here I had the big eye tuna, which was cooked to perfection! Love love love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to enjoy a great meal. There is NOTHING about this place that isn't top notch. Service, food, drinks,atmosphere. All 5 stars"}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner.  My friend and I split the scallops and the NY steak and they were delicious.  A few comments:  1) the restaurant is in a high-end mall so it didn't feel very secluded or intimate; 2) we ordered creamed spinach and mashed potatoes as our sides.  These side portions could have easily fed 4-5 people each.  I wished that the waiter would have told us that how much food this is. Too much waste.  We were on vacation - so no doggy-bags possible."}
{"text":"SUPER DELICIOUS.  JUST LIKE THE ONE IN COSTA MESA.

MASTROS HAS ONE OF THE BEST AGED RIB EYES.

We did it family style.  Ordered 2 Bone In Ribeye Steaks.  Unfortunately they didn't have the \"Chef's Cut\" at this location.  So just got the regular, still super delicious.  Really, really good steaks.  Aged meat, juicy, charred and seasoned just right.  

Potatoes, mac n cheese, tomatoes and onions, all great."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Very classy and although there is not a dress code, I would suggest dressing nicely. Very high end food and high end service. The waiters are dressed in Tuxes and are very knowledgeable. Had the Sea Bass as well as great sides like lobster mash potatoes and creamed spinach. Everything was amazing. It's on the expensive side so bring your plastic."}
{"text":"Incredible place. Came here for a birthday party, 7 of us. The bread basket is to die for - pretzel buns and the sourdough are the best! I had the rack of lamb - very yummy, tender, not overcooked. Others had the petite filet, New York steak, regular filet, lemon sole, scallops, and roast chicken. The side dishes are huge, and can easily serve 4-6 people. (We had lobster mashed potatoes, regular mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and 2 types of mushrooms.) The butter cake was so recommended, we had to get it. Hell yeah, as good as advertised! And the chocolate cake (can't remember what it was called - it's the more traditional one) was delicious as well. But one of my absolute favorites was the whipped cream that came with dessert. It could've been dessert in and of itself. Thick and rich. Was like eating sweet butter! We were eating it by the spoonful, it was so good. (I took some of the cake home, and ate it the next morning - the whipped cream was STILL fresh - not flattened! Now that's good whipped cream!). Great service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food and service,  the music in the bar is perfect..."}
{"text":"What is not to like about this fine dining establishment located in Crystals found at the heart of the City Center.

Supurb steaks......
Lobster mashed potatoes........
Super sushi rolls...
Excellent seafod.....
An extensive wine list 
Buttercake with real whipped cream for dessert ...... oh yeahhhhhh

The location is very unique, in that you can sit out on a terrace in an art deco treehouse and under some beautiful chandeliers.
The service is very good, the wait staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.
We had an enjoyable evening topped off by a table visit from Lucianna, the manager.

We were recommended to enjoy \"Earthquake\" an excellent Cabernet Sauvignon
from the Lodi vineyards, California.
I would pass that recommendation on to you - if you are enjoying the fine steaks....... 
It is an absolutely supurb wine selection.

At first I was sceptical of the Lobster mashed potatoes, but the 
dish is a real treat.... 
and the portion is so huge that it can be shared by all at the table.
A totally unique sidedish... containing an amazing amount of lobster
 
Don't miss dining here....
I think this is one of the finest dining experiences you can enjoy while in Las Vegas.

I can not wait to return."}
{"text":"The service at Mastro's was impeccable.  The restaurant is beautiful.  We ordered the crab cakes, tuna tower and salmon appetizers to begin with. We were already full with those 3. They have good sized portions so consider that when you order your appetizers."}
{"text":"This place is the definition of pure luxury.  Pretty much the best that money can buy.  Top quality meat and seafood, expertly poured drinks, and an atmosphere that makes you feel like you're in The Great Gatsby."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of ribeye, do yourself a favor and come to Mastro's indulge and in what is the TOMAHAWK: a 33oz bone-in beast of a steak worth every penny of your winnings. 

This intimidating slab of wagyu beef was perfectly medium rare, well marbled, and seasoned with care despite it's size. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, steaks I have had. You can be a monster and eat it all, or even split it with someone and order a few sides. 

So what if Mastro's is in a mall or if the \"treehouse\" is a little tacky for your tastes...you'll forget after your first bite. Best mall food ever."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I fell in love with this place for several reasons.  The staff, the atmosphere, and the food combined to bring us back the next night as well  We were able to make reservations through Yelp and OpenTable but we arrived early each night and sat in the first come, first serve bar area.  The piano entertainment was first class. Our server, Racqel, was always timely, willing to meet our every request, and helpful in navigating the menu to ensure we got the most of the food choices we desired with the least amount of waste.  Her name escapes me now but there was a corporate employee there the second night who recognized us from the night before.  She not only bought our first round of drinks but when we were leaving insisted we try their \"Butter Cake\" so much so that she ended up giving it to us.  Very good stuff. I can't imagine anyone not feeling good upon receipt of this restaurant \"regular\" type of treatment on a 3 day, 2 night trip.  Sheri and I can't wait to return to town and visit the place again!  I highly recommend any of the filets, shriimp cocktail, king crab, lobster mashed potatoes, lobster bisque, gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the red snapper.  They will split any plate they have, upon request."}
{"text":"Wow! I have finally been able to visit Ocean Club and it was well worth it. 

For starters, I got there just in time to snag a parking spot right out front (Thank you parking fairies). The hostess immediately sat us even though our entire party had not arrived yet ( double score as most places won't do that) 

Our server's name was Darian, and at first I thought he was in a bad mood because he appeared not happy with me when I asked for a black napkin instead of blurting out my drink order first. However I had him laughing and joking with me by the end of the night and realized whatever was gone on earlier in the evening had nothing to do with me :) Score one for Darian :) 

Drinks - Pomegranate Martini - Good lord it was good and pricey. But you pretty much do get two drinks in one and I was practically trying to break the shaker trying to get every last drop. (Darian even showed me a few tricks to make sure I got every last drop thank you!) 

Appetizers - we ordered the seafood tower and it had lobster, crab, shrimp and oysters. Plus we had a side of steamed mussels. I was in seafood heaven. Everything was so good. I practically ate all of the steamed mussels myself. Heck it was a meal in itself lol. 

Main course - Chilean Sea Bass. Could anything be any more flakier and melt in your mouth good? Cooked to perfection and it was HUGE! 

Sides - we had the gorgonzola mac and cheese, sauteed spinach, and my all time favorite roasted brussel sprouts. Those that know me know I love me some brussel sprouts, so needless to say, that side was all mine. OMG! Roasted to perfection and oh so good. I actually ate more brussel sprouts then the sea bass. (What can you say I love Brussel sprouts) 

Dessert - There is always room for dessert and I ordered the warm butter cake. It was like sweet cornbread with fresh berries, ice cream and fresh whip cream on the side. Luckily I was sharing that with two other people because it was huge. A great way to top off the night. Oh by the way, another friend ordered the layer cake. Let's just say that was the biggest slice of cake I have ever seen in one serving. It could have easily fed a family of 4-6 lol. WOWZA! 

Very nice place and I am sure when I will be back again one day. But until then, I will remember how lovely the evening was by eating all the yummy leftovers :)"}
{"text":"Second time there. Service very good. The steaks are amazing and lobster mash. My fish came didn't come out hot but it was fine. It left more room in my stomach for the BUTTER CAKE which insane!!!!"}
{"text":"A perfect meal in Vegas! Although the wait was over an hour long, we immediately found a table in the bar which turned out to be more intimate than any of the tables in the dining room. Service was prompt; the waitress delightful and extremely knowledgeable. This was literally the best meal I have ever shared with my boyfriend of nearly a year. Each item was split and served on two plates in perfect presentation: the heirloom tomato salad, the blackened halibut. The brussel sprouts and lobster mash potatoes were of plenty proportions - and the mash had the most perfect creamy flavor with an abundance of lobster. The variety of breads were served warm with soften tabs of butter. Ever staff person was attentive. The drinks, a pomegranate martini and cucumber cooler, were a homerun. I've never tasted something better in my life. If I had the room, I know the butter cake would kick butt of any cake I ever ate (I'm going back today to make sure). And the coffee served at the end of the meal was the testament that the entire meal was EPIC. Thank you Mastro!"}
{"text":"This was actually my first time at mastros, and the food was delicious, although a bit on the salty side.

First of all.. The bread was to die for.. My friends and I had to restrain ourselves from devouring two baskets of bread so we won't be too full for our meal.

We ordered a Caesars salad split between three people, but it didn't come out until AFTER our meal and sides came. I didn't think that was very professional, but everyone makes mistakes. 

We got the cream corn and lobster mashed potatoes for our sides. They were both to die for! I ordered the sautéed scallops which were delicious but a little too salty for my taste. My two friends ordered the filet mignon and the bone-in ribeye, which they loved. 

We also ordered two bottles of the Argyle Pinot noir, which our server recommended for us. It was wonderful.. Not too sweet, not too dry. 

We also informed our waiter that it was our friend's birthday, so at the end of our meal, they brought out an amaaaazing butter cake with a candle! 

Overall, the experience was great, especially sitting in the nest! Lol"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Las Vegas for last 10 years on business conference. As a result, I've had the opportunity to visit many restaurants on and off the Strip. Mastro's Ocean Club ranks at the very top of all of my dinning experiences. The restaurant is located in the Crystals Shops in the Aria hotel. The place is quite stylish and spacious.

What is there not to love about Mastro's? The carefully crafted cocktails and perfectly cooked food with amazing sides dishes is a given for a calibre of this restaurant. The menu is varied and offers a wide selection of seafood and steaks. Other vegetarian options and (chicken, duck, eggs) are also available. The accompanying dishes, wine pairings and cocktails were really what dining at Mastro's to a higher level of excellence. 

The only time I eat bread and butter is while dining at restaurants. I certainly wasn't disappointed by the carefully arranged basket of bread and the purest of butter goodness at Mastro's. Since I'm a vegetarian, chef prepared perfect pasta for me off the menu. Sides of note; macaroni and cheese was one of the best ones I have had. The sautéed mushrooms were absolutely out of this world. For desert a butter cake that was large enough to serve 2. One of the better butter cakes I have had.

A tequilla based cocktail marked the start of our eating festivities and a good South Australian Shiraz ensured the gleeful fine dining momentum continued throughout. Mastro's is absolutely on the pricy side. However, it's literally worth every single penny. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough."}
{"text":"Hmmm, I really wanted to enjoy Mastro's. However, it doesn't even measure up to Eddie V's, which is an industry standard--especially when the price is as high as it is. The atmosphere and bar are cool, with live music and an energetic vibe. The food was average, if not a bit boring, and the service was not too far behind. I felt like a lot of the flavor was nonexistent and butter was overused. I had ordered the house salad and a cup of the Boston clam chowder. The salad was not much better than what I could get from the grocery store in one of those bags you can toss all the ingredients together--don't get me wrong, I like those things lol! The soup was decent, but all I remember are the potatoes, nothing else. The crab ceviche looked amazing and fresh--I'd probably get that next time! For entrees, almost all of our small group ordered a bone-in filet accompanied with asparagus, mashed potatoes and their signature crab gnocchi. While the asparagus and mashed potatoes were nothing special, they didn't disappoint like the gnocchi, which had an overwhelming fishy taste. Everyone at the table ended up leaving it alone. My husband's filet was cooked medium rare like he asked, but the plate was so hot, it cooked through to almost well done by the time he was really into the middle of it. One colleague ordered a New York strip and I must say that was the best looking cut of meat I've seen in a long time--and delicious too! Another colleague had a prawn added to his dish--this thing looked like it had steroids pumped into it! It was about as big as a lobster! Our dessert was, of course, their famous butter cake. I enjoyed this quite a bit--it's moist and sweet, just like it should be! The service was a bit scattered. We had 3-4 waiters, I'm really not sure who was the main one serving our table. I understand they want to be attentive, but one of them could not crack a smile for the life of him, and just went about his evening taking requests and delivering the goods when necessary. Otherwise, there were some hits, some misses... overall, just a very average and forgettable steakhouse."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale for Spring Training and looking to get a great steak.  Everyone I asked kept telling me to go to Mastro's Ocean Club.  now I know why.  From the minute you walk in, you are surrounded by excitement.  The bar area was packed, but not so bad that you could not get a drink.   The meals were fantastic and the steak was prob one of the 3 best I have ever enjoyed.  Highly recommend inf you are in Scottsdale.   Not cheap, but worth it."}
{"text":"Ok. I have walked by this place a dozen times in the Crystal Shoppes and always just thought it was a mall restaurant. Surprises in Vegas keep on coming. I checked on Yelp and it was rated pretty high at 4.5 with 589 reviews. The final selling point was that it is open until 1 am which makes sense in Vegas. It is a pain to make it to a show and have dinner finished by 10 pm. A lot of the supposed higher end restaurants could do a lot better job on their hours in Vegas. Mastros does and so it got our reservation. We had a great dinner, the sea food tower was stacked and very well done. Everyone enjoyed their meals, the steaks and fish meals were great and not a complaint was raised at the table. The wine was recommended and reasonable. Not to mention very well paired to the meal. Thanks to Dion (our waiter), for a really enjoyable evening. He made the night work for everyone, even though it started off a little shaky. A bit more attention by the host staff when dropping people in the bar to wait on their table would have earned 5 stars. 

However, we would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Awesome Restaurant. Order the special dry ice Lemon Drop and Cosmopolitan Martini's. They are definitely not for the unobtrusive. The iceberg wedge salad, crab cake and Lobster Mashed Potatoes are great and my husband enjoyed his swordfish but the piece de resistance is the Butter Cake with fresh whipped cream. The service was impeccable and friendly. This was such a pleasant experience that we want to try the Mastro's in Beverly Hills, Chicago and AZ as well."}
{"text":"Oh yeah...awesome restaurant....delicious food, excellent service. Add this to the Vegas must visit restaurants. Btw, we had the fresh Arctic Char...enough for three people, along with the Mac n cheese side. I had the King Crab legs. Just delicious. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"1.5 star unfortunate disappointment

Extremely disappointing is my comment. 

Having tried Mastro's in multiple cities, even Mastro's City Hall a week ago in Scottsdale, and Mastro's Ocean Club in Newport Beach and Vegas on multiple occasions, this experience was a disappointment. We were 5 and 3 of us ordered Florida Grouper. (Probably should be off the menu or there's a chef issue). 

Overcooked, not fresh tasting, grouper is a real disappointment. The 2 people who ordered steaks were happy. I have had the sashimi grade ahi at Ocean Club in other cities and it was 5 star---I probably would not order it here. 

Further, the lobster mashed potatoes were bad. It's really hard to screw this dish up but the lobster was huge lumps and the pool of butter made this look like something out of a 1995 Paul Prudhomme cooking show. 

$6 to park, not horrible, except I dropped about $600 on a really bad meal. I didn't want to screw up the birthday celebration, so I was polite. Later, we all concurred this place doesn't rate. 

I would strongly urge anyone going into a Mastro's Ocean Club in AZ to stay away from the seafood. The mac and cheese was good."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club located in Crystals at CityCenter is absolutely the best place restaurant with the best service on the latest Vegas business trip. In fact, I was more impressed with the non-swanky mall location than its Orange County siblings.

The Mall is incredibly quiet and the piano acoustics are phenomenal, making dinner at the bar or at a quiet table a very nice experience. Victor is a great bartender and the service is wonderful. As with all Mastro's, the wine list is incredible and goes on and on. Tonight was a Darioush Cabernet starter night as I pondered this wonderful menu, trying to stay light and healthy, amongst some decadent alternatives. 

Eventually, I decided on a starter of Jalapeno Tuna Sashimi which is ahi tuna
sliced sashimi style, topped with fresh squeezed key lime juice, thinly sliced jalapenos, and ponzu chili sauce. This is light despite looking like a lot of chili sauce. 

Next, a salad of beefsteak tomato and onion with balsamic was a refreshing without being super oldtime steakhouse heavy! 

For an entree, I ordered another small plate: The lobster cocktail which is 1.25 pounds (including shells). Now after eating all of this, I have slowed down and am just enjoying my wine when a couple of friends show up and we decide to end the evening with the crab claws which are excellent.

What an incredible meal, great services, great music and very relaxing."}
{"text":"Mastros is my favorite fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas!!!! There ribeye steak is grilled to perfection and is so tender and juicy and the lobster mash is a must as well! I've been celebrating my birthday here for the last couple of years now but this year I was a little disappointed because they didnt serve the warm butter cake as my birthday desert"}
{"text":"I had been intrigued by the scallop-looking building in the sky since the first time I had gone to Crystals when it had initially opened.  I finally went earlier this week, and was extremely impressed with the decor and the service (everyone from the host stand to the waiter -- service is top notch here).  When the menu came, I was in a seafood eater's heaven!!  Their seafood, which ranges from the traditional (tuna, salmon, swordfish) to the the more interesting (opakapaka and chilean seabass), is flown in fresh.... and that's what allows Mastro's to keep the flavors simple so that the fish remains the star on the plate.  I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass and my man went for their jumbo lobster tails.  Brilliance.   The group we were with also ordered almost all the sides on this menu and stand outs were the creamed spinach, the asparagus, and the sauteed mushrooms.   Their wine list is also pretty extensive and the sauvignon blanc was fantastic.   We skipped dessert because we were too full... but the tea we had (they have really interesting flavors, including chocolate coconut) was a perfect compliment to a great meal.  Given the choice between Bartolotta (see my review) and Mastro's, I would take Mastro's any day.  Bravo, Mastro's, on a job well done!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for an anniversary dinner before watching Le Reve. Since it was Monday after Easter, it was easy to make a same day reservation for 5:30 pm. The place was pretty quiet then and around 6:30, more people started to come by so we definitely beat the dinner rush. Got a nice seat in the treehouse, with a view overlooking the Dior store downstairs.

Since we didn't want to be food comatose for our show later, we ordered just the petite filet, the regular filet, and a side of scalloped potatoes. I also ordered Coke, but beware that it's by the aluminum bottle and not with unlimited refills. The scalloped potatoes were rich and delicious, but the cheese was too much halfway through the side order. The meat was very tender and cooked to perfection. The medium was medium and the medium rare was just as it should be. Since it was our anniversary, they also brought by a complimentary slice of rich chocolate cake topped with raspberries and whipped cream. Overall a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"I was back to Vegas with my work team. First time at Mastro's Ocean Club, a restaurant in the middle of Crystal Mall. We booked dinner reservation for 9:45 pm for 6 on Sunday May/18/14 after the Show. I arrived 7 mins early, but our table was not ready and we were seated 10:10 pm (empty table needs to set up for 6). Our waiter was very tentative and recommend us the seafood platter.
The Alaskan Red King Crab Claws & the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktails were awesome. 
My Rack of Lamb was cooked medium rare as I requested on a super Hot Plate. Perfect!. The rest of the food and side dishes were great. The only less desirable thing was by the time we got our main course it was 11:40 pm at night. 
For sure it was a bit pricey, our bill came to $1200 USD for 6 of us.
Overall, it was a good experience.
Maybe we will try again an earlier dinner time when we have a chance again."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant I have ate at in a long time. Everything we mouth watering. The service was great. The dessert was AMAZING!!! You have to get the butter cake.... mind blowing. My husband didn't barely eat his chocolate layered cake because he got a taste of my butter cake and couldn't stop eating it! Lol So make sure you get two!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sea food restaurants and probably my favorite architectural peice in all of Las Vegas.  How often do you get to eat in a world class tree house?  Once you've eaten here your tummy will answer, Not Enough!  It was my birthday and I had so many choices so I choose Mastro's.  It was amazing from start to finish. We sat at the bar and had a drink while waiting for our table.  One of the nicest looking bars in town and they always pure 2oz drinks!  Friendly professional staff were on top of our every need.  The hostess brought us to our table in the tree house.  I couldn't have picked a better table. We had the perfect view of the tree house and ice sculptures below.  I ordered the salmon and my lady ordered the 6oz filet.  We ordered two sides as they are plentiful. The gorgonzola mac & cheese and the sweet snap pea's.  They surprised me with a butter cake topped with incredible delicious scoop of ice cream and decorated with chocolate.  Thank you for the staff for making my birthday awesome."}
{"text":"If you want to hoit your toit, the Ocean Club has you covered, and the seafood here is extraordinary. I lopped one star due to the usually wonderful service being off last night, but the seafood tower with iced crab, oysters on the half shell, and pink, chubby shrimp the size of a child's fist can go far to assuage lax service. The OC has long been the place to watch your local legislators, honchos and botoxed, spray-tanned Scottsdale tennis set letting their hair down next to the piano bar. The clientele here doesn't mind paying $18 for a cosmo with cool dry ice bubbling it up into a witches' brew, but the music before ten was blasting so loud that even intimate conversation was nearly impossible. Why a restaurant of this caliber would shatter ambience with ridiculous amps is beyond me. We ordered a basket of string fries as an appetizer, and our waitress suddenly had bigger fish to fry since we didn't order the tower or another ginormous, spendy menu item like we usually do. When quality of service is gauged to the size of the bill this obviously, staff training needs a jump start. Kitchen staff smoking next to valet isn't appealing, either. The homemade whipped cream with the creme brulee and chocolate suicide cake was simply decadent, but still, the music level and service issues must be overcome if OC wants to stay in the game in this part of town."}
{"text":"Party of 8 on a Tuesday night.
Interesting set up - there is a part of the restaurant that looks like a large wooden hornet's nest.  Not sure what that's all about.  

Service was impeccable from the hostess to the main server to his assistants.  Everything was prompt, polite and timed well.  We were not rushed out even though we were one of the last parties to leave. 

Food:
I ordered the Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese $12 and the Rack of Lamb $48.  The mac and cheese was a little disappointing - very little flavor and it was dry,  very dry.  I had read that this was a great side dish so I was sad when it wasn't very palatable.  The portion is huge - consider sharing it if you do.  It easily fed our entire table.  I asked for the Rack of Lamb medium rare and it came out closer to medium.  Regardless, the flavor was very smooth, not gamey.  The outside was a little too charred, but the rest of it was quite good.  It came with mint jelly, which was very tasty.  We also had a Heirloom Tomato and Burrata salad $12 which was a very generous portion - the tomatoes were sweet and juicy.  The table got the Seafood Tower (have no idea how much that was but it was worth it).  This was friggin amazing.  Honestly.  There were Kumamoto oysters, fresh dungeness crab, snow crab legs, humongous shrimp, great big lobster claws.  All fresh and tender meat.  It didn't require sauce.  None of it was briny or sandy.  So delicious and whatever we paid, I don't care.  It was unbelievable. Other people in our party got the Arctic Char \"oreganato\" style, bone-in filet, seared scallops and halibut.  Every dish was served with mushrooms, asparagus, green beans and creamed corn (this had to have crack in it b/c creamed corn never tasted so good.)  NO ONE had a single complaint and EVERYONE finished what they ordered.  By this time, we're all about to pass out from food coma, but we insisted on the BUTTER CAKE.  If you come here, no matter what you order, you MUST save room for this signature dessert.  I can't even describe it but it is amazing.  It comes out warm, w/ freshly made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.   MUST.  MUST.  MUST have.  

Overall, great experience.  Cost us a total of $1400 for 7 people.  You do the math."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and seeing the menu and price of the food, I expected it to be above average and amazing. The service was good, but the food was just average in my opinion. The tuna tar tar lacked salt and the scallops were in a nice sauce but undercooked in my opinion. The bread basket was the best part of the meal in my opinion."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, you gotta do it right and Mastro's is well...doing it right.

Mastro's Ocean Club is owned by the same very popular chain steakhouses but focuses more on a seafood selection. It's located right in the Crystals shopping center in City Center. 

I came here with a group of 9 and we were able to be seated in the treehouse (ballin!). Food was great. I had the bone in ribeye and but also nibbled on a chilean sea bass as well. Both were delicious. The sides rocked as well with the wasabi mashed potatoes being my favorite. 

Overall a great dining experience, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The filet was cooked to perfection... great flavor.  My drink was a bit strong in fact I couldn't even finish it.  Definitely a place to revisit."}
{"text":"Went here for my wedding dinner 4/6/2012. We were early so we sat at the bar. Had some really cool drinks thanks to bartender Amy. Very accommodating restaurant. Food delicious. Especially the dessert which we were too full to eat. But we did anyway! Delicious. Make it a point to go there, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"To start, great atmosphere. The bar is very attractive with the artistic bottle layout.  The restaurant is set up with a patio like feel, so its a little loud.  Food was great, steaks were cooked to perfection, and the sides were spot on. I highly recommend the mac, it pairs very well with the steak. The service was good, the waiters were very knowledgeable and professional. Even if you are stuffed, order the butter cake to finish off your dinner, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Perfect. Good prices for the service and portions. Best steakhouse I've been to ever."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Atlantic char served orreganato (sp?) lobster mashed potatoes are killer and it's a great place for a date! Very expensive, but the offer an option to order half of anything on the menu, making the prices more affordable"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim the other night for dinner and couldn't have had a greater time. I had the pleasure of having a gentleman named Matt as my server and he made for an extremely delightful experience. He knew the menu and the specials by heart and gave me great recommendations based on my interests. He was friendly, professional and even cracked a few jokes which made my solo dinner outing so much less uncomfortable - felt like he was an old friend.   I had the truffle gnocchi which I highly suggest if you're a truffle fan. Thanks also to Matt for recommending the butter cake which was to die for. It's waiters like him that keep me coming back to places like this. A+"}
{"text":"Dinner was divine. The steak was perfectly seasoned, same with the Brussels sprouts and broccoli, and the lobster mash potatoes!  Errrrmahgawd! Freaking delicious! Their assorted bread basket had me feeling like it was going to be a short night (we were set to club hop). I ordered the berry lemonade cocktail which was plenty of booze to keep me going. The best thing of all from that dinner was the dessert. Butter cake. Freaking heart stopping delicious. Service was exceptional and the ambiance set the tone to a great dinner with great company."}
{"text":"Five star food. Two star service. We had dinner at my favorite restaurant Ocean Club for my birthday last night. The poor service started before we even arrived and continued for the duration of our dinner. My bestie prearranged to have a bottle of my favorite wine chilled on the table when I arrived and it wasn't there. We sat in the bar and our waiter Andy (?) introduced himself and his assistant. From that point on we had to continuously ask for wine. Andy walked by and ignored us, we had to ask for bread plates, appetizer plates, silverware. The table wasn't reset between courses. At one point my husband had to get Andy's attention by saying \"excuse me the ladies would like more wine and can you please clear some of these plates\" the tables in the bar area are a little small and we needed room and when my husband handed Andy a plate he refused to take it saying his assistant would be back. Ocean Club is our favorite restaurant and we brought a couple who had never been there and were so disappointed in the service. Our bill was $630+ and we will know next time to ask for Duke! It was still a special and really fun night with great friends and amazing food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Ocean Club - We go at least once a month for date night. We prefer to sit in the bar/lounge area where they have live music while we enjoy our dinner.

We habitually start off with some Dirty Martini's (w/ blue-cheese stuffed olives of course) and at least a dozen oysters. If we're in the mood for a salad the wedge is where it's at.

For our main course, I always order the Petite Filet while my husband usually gets the Chilean Sea Bass. Both are delicious.

Without fail, we order a few sides to share as well. Their Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi, Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Creamed Spinach and Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese (+ jalapeños) are among our favorites.

As for dessert, their signature warm Butter Cake is essential!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent as was the service we had the chopped salad and blackened salmon both were delicious , will defiantly return"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary here and hands down from the time we arrived until we left everything was phenomenal the server Jonathan is very knowledgeable he told us about the menu items in detail and his suggestions were great we enjoyed every minute of our time the dessert was the bomb must have the butter cake with  vanilla ice cream!"}
{"text":"Quite simply the best fish I have ever had, as for my wife also the best fish she has ever had.  I had the Swordfish blackened, my wife had a fresh seasonal filet of Wild Caught Salmon seasoned with their special house blend.  Both were outstanding and some of the largest fish filets we have ever seen, but yet still cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Also had amazing sides of asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  Service was great and I would recommend that anyone should try it at least once.  Prices are high, but side dishes are served family style, so at least you will get full unlike some of those trendy-trash places that give you a fish nugget with a red sauce on it and call it gourmet.  Go there and eat fish."}
{"text":"Had a disappointing meal here last night. Brought out the inlaws and some of their friends visiting from out of town.

The food my wife and I had was perfect. I had the sea bass an my wife had the seared ahi and a shrimp cocktail. All were delicious.

The problem last night was with the steaks. 3 of the people in my group ordered filets. 2 of the 3 were end cuts and slightly over cooked. Not enough to go through the hassle of sending them back and getting new steaks but for a place like Mastro's not the typical perfection I have known to expect. 

My father inlaws had been looking toward to this steak all week and went home disappointed.

The other problem I noticed lat night is that they seem to be jamming more and more tables into the place which means you're sitting right on top of the tables around you. 

Eddie V's might be the new go to..."}
{"text":"I guess I just can't say that I am a fan of this famous restaurant, but hubby is definitely a fan of their steak, so still 4 stars, the service was over the top, and the restaurant is classy and beautiful. 

Decided to have anniversary dinner here, we asked to be seated at one of those window seatings in the tree house, our host managed to get us one, it was very nice of her. Started off with bottle of French champagne, loved it, the bread basket was so delicious, just too much for 2 people, it could easily feed up to 5 people seriously! Menu is huge, in addition to lots of choices of steaks, the seafood selections were great too, also sushi items. 

Our server introduced lots of things, we decided to do chilled seafood platter first, a little bit of everything on the platter. The presentation was amazing, smokes came out of the prawns container, beautiful and appetizing. The Kumamoto oysters were so good, the lobster claw meat was fairly tender. But the other things were bad, the crab meat was so hard and chewy, the prawns were the worst, they were hard to cut, harder to chewy on, almost impossible to swallow, we couldn't even finish them, so wasteful! The horseradish and cocktail sauces were so good, great with the chilled seafood. It pains me to say that this seafood platter was the worst I have ever had, for a famous steakhouse, that's unacceptable! 

Clam chowder soup with garlic bread, our server was nice enough to split the soup for us, even though we didn't ask so. The soup portion was still huge after splitting, too bad I didn't want any soup, so I just gave it to hubby, kinda felt bad for our server's thoughtful gesture. 

Lobster roll as my entree, it was so bad, the rice was thick, the stuffings were flavorless, I didn't like the cream sauce on it, I had one and half pieces, and couldn't continue to eat. 

12 oz bone in filet in medium rare, the plate was 400 degrees hot! Perfectly cooked to medium rare, the steak melted in hubby's mouth right away, he said it tasted amazing! Absolutely loved every single bite of it! 

Side of mushrooms, I love mushrooms so much, but those were so bland, I had one bite, that's it. 

So, either my taste buds were numbed from too much drinking? Or Mastro's is really just for steak lovers? My food was just bad... I didn't even eat that much, just sat there, sip on my champagne, and tried very hard not to fall asleep in the middle of a dinner date! 

They gave us anniversary chocolate cake with a lit candle, so beautiful, and a huge plate of whipped cream too. The cake was so good, both of us loved it, so yummy! I had a 20 -yr -old tawny ($27) to go with it, it was amazing. It's a famous steakhouse, of course it's pricey. Reserved wine list starts at $100 a bottle, up to 10 thousand. Tab was $350 for two. 

To be honest, I didn't like my food, not one bit, dinner experience was good, I was just too sleepy to really enjoy it. Their restroom is located on second floor next to private dining room, the elevator was claustrophobic. 

 I don't think this place is good for dinner dates, food is too much for two people, impossible to finish everything. The restaurant is too bright, not intimate at all. But it's definitely great for family, group dining, or steak lovers!"}
{"text":"Great upscale lounge with piano bar. I Coates for a late meal on Christmas Eve and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Ocean Club is one of the upper end seafood & steak restaurants that puts out a high quality meal. From the large tiger prawns to the Filet Mignon, quality product and perfect preparation are clearly a priority here. We also enjoyed the Caesar salad ) which is one of the best in the valley) lobster bisque, twice baked potato & their highly recommended vanilla butter cake; everything listed was fabulous and worth going back for. 

The service at Ocean Club is impeccable! 

Items that disappointed were the overly greasy lobster mashed potatoes, lack luster chopped salad and dry chocolate layer cake; thus the 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Being from Omaha, Ne, steaks are never on our mind when traveling (we have Omaha Steaks), so it was the best seafood we were looking for in Las Vegas. 

I read great reviews of Mastro's, and a couple bad ones, but we forged ahead as it was one of the top 3 in LV.

The food was presented extremely well, had outstanding flavor, and nothing seemed to have been prepared in advance.

Our server, Trista, made a 4.5 meal into a 5 star evening. The lobster bisque is a must have, if only to share, but don't miss it.

Sea scallops and Brussels sprouts were done perfectly. But the big surprise, although I had no room left (I did push through the pain) was the dessert. A butter cake with ice cream and fresh whipped cream on the side. Get the butter cake to share at the end.

Seemed odd to go to an upscale shopping mall for dinner, but the suspended atmosphere at Mastro's gave our evening a very fun feel. We will be back, but still probably won't order a steak."}
{"text":"Meh. Underwhelming. I do not care to ever return to this restaurant. It really just does not feel like a steakhouse, it felt more like a cafe. We stopped by before going out for my friends birthday and we were pretty regretful with our choice. Considering it is Mastro's, I had much higher expectations. Food was bland and so were their servers lol bye."}
{"text":"An exceptional dining experience from start to finish.  

Service = exceptional

Food = exceptional, executed well

Ambiance = Classy - but for people who come in and shorts and flip flops

I highly suggest the filet mignon.  As a meat lover, I ended up choosing the 12oz versus the 9oz.  In retrospect, I should have gone with the 9oz.  Nonetheless, it was a perfectly cooked medium steak.  I started off with a caesar salad, which was a bit salty."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and I have to say this is probably my favorite restaurant of all time. The food is simply phenomenal and the service is excellent, too. It's definitely on the pricey side, but well worth it if you're looking for something nice. It can be the small things that make or break an establishment-in this case it's the ability to get \"half\" orders of their salads and side orders. Nice touch. I highly recommend giving Mastro's a try. Because it's in the middle of an indoor shopping mall, it's a little bit of a stretch to say it's super romantic or intimate. But, it's easy to tune all of that out and just focus on your food and company. I hardly ever give 5 star reviews, but I think this place has earned it."}
{"text":"Excellent service here. The food was just okay. We had filets, which the quality of meat was just okay. Could've been fixed with a good sear and finish on the steak, which was just not there. The garlic mash was amazing! The truffle crab gnocchi, not good. Pass on this. Crab was fishy and it was absent of truffle. They still had a fantastic bread basket like most Mastro's but their stars, the steak and seafood were so so."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update all of you and say that the manager reached out to me and apologized for the poor experience we had there.  He informed me that they would be opening up a location in NYC and would be sending me a gift certificate to enjoy on my first visit to the new location.  I will update after that experience, but I was very happy with the response I received from the manager.  He showed that the restaurant really does care about the opinion of its customers."}
{"text":"We went here for our annual Christmas Eve dinner out and experienced lovely service. The Arctic Char was wonderful but the Red Snapper was seared and dried out. No sauce and over cooked which made a bland meal. The butter cake was a rich delicious dessert and I'd definitely eat the cake and Arctic Char repeatedly. The worst part was that my husband (consumed the snapper) got food poisoning afterward. We ate all the same things and the only meal we didn't share was our entrees. Christmas Day was pretty miserable for him and I'm disappointed that we will not visit Mastro's again because the service and parts of the meal were great but to serve food that is not fresh is terrible."}
{"text":"Our wedding anniversary dinner could not have been better. Excellent and attentive service by Jonny. Awesome NY steak and to top it off they gave us a complimentary dessert for our celebration. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good but not amazing. I've had a better rib eye the night before at Steak and Stone. Part of the appeal of Ocean Club is the vibe. Live music, low lighting, and high end atmosphere. Craft beer selection was ok at best. I believe they focus on cocktails. Price point is about $80 a person."}
{"text":"I came here specifically to eat crab gnocci before I started my diet. We could have been seated but I suggested we sit at the bar because we had great service the last time we sat at the bar. We waited a very long time to get a menu, waited a long time for our waters, and waited again to place our order. That's all we did was wait. For everything. An hour passed and I asked for the manager. I told him about the service and that we were still waiting on our food. He comped our drinks and we went to Dominick's. I was really shocked at how bad the service was. When you pay an arm and a leg for food you expect a high level of food and service. I understand there are off situations and I hope that's the case."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious!!!!  Great for a romantic dinner or dinner with a group of friends - my husband and I go once a month!!!!"}
{"text":"Visited for lunch last year.  Food quality is fantastic.  Great cocktail menu.  Would definitely try dinner when I have the chance.  Service was great, but restaurant was not busy when I was there.  The Beef Carpaccio as a starter is wicked!!  Big wine list also!!"}
{"text":"Our reservations were for 10:30 pm (Valentine's Day), but we arrived a little after 10:00 and were quickly seated in the \"tree house\", which is more like a bird cage!  Our waitress (Tanya) was phenomenal the entire evening.  She catered to every need and offered excellent suggestions during ordering.  

We began with a few cocktails, which were very tasty.  My wife and I decided to split a bowl of Lobster bisque, since I had read reviews that it was very good (I had Lobster  bisque the previous evening at a Venitian restaurant, and was very disappointed).  This bisque was the best I have ever had!  It was a quite large serving with many sizeable pieces of lobster.  It could easily satisfy as a meal by itself!

As a main course, we split the Chilean Sea Bass ($50, I think).  When asked for suggestions, Tanya recommended the Blackened seasoning.  For sides, we chose the King Crab truffled Gnocci ($29), and Roasted Brussle Sprouts ($11).  The fish came a la carte on a large plate.  For being a split order, the portions were surprisingly generous.  The gnocci and brussle sprouts came as large sides to be shared.  The waitress dished the sides on the main plate.

Now, plated and ready to go, and accompanied by a basket of various breads, my wife and I embarked on the best meal we have ever had!  Initially, we agreed it had to be in the top three, but then we couldn't come up with where we had had a more impeccable meal (and service).

The Sea Bass was tender, flakey, moist, and so perfectly seasoned.  The Gnocci had large pieces of crab mixed with the creamy gnocci.  For the brussle sprouts, we like them almost burnt on the outside to bring out the flavor.  They, too, were perfectly roasted dark and tender!  

We ate the all the fish, even though we were quite full.  We took home the leftover gnocci and brussle sprouts, which was enough to make another whole meal for two.  My wife made the comment that she wanted to take home a piece of the bread that was still in the bread basket.  The waitress said she would get us fresh ones.  With our leftovers, she packed four extra pieces of the fresh \"pretzle\" bread.

We travel a lot, we love to cook, and we love to eat at quality restaurants.  If you go to Vegas, you HAVE to eat here!  We hope your experience is as enjoyable as ours was!"}
{"text":"Great steaks, fantastic pretzel bread, the freshest fish (my wife swears by the crab cocktail appetizer) and of course the out of this world butter cake. What a fantastic meal up in the \"birds nest\" at City Center.  Still prefer the Newport Beach location but when in Vegas . . ."}
{"text":"This is actually 3.5 stars.  So me and the guys had dinner here last night and as usual the food is excellent (5 stars).  

The reason for the lower rating was due to service and ambience.  I've been to other Mastro's and their service has always been top notch.  They always anticipated your needs and followed up quickly.

Our main server here could have worked at Sizzler, Black Angus, Outback or any of those type of places and the clientele there would have thought he was good.  At Mastro's, not the case.  

I am a low maintenance client and in the restaurant business so I understand how it can be.  But last night's dinner service wasn't busy and Mastro's has a pretty good wait staff to client ratio so our needs should have been met fairly easily.  

My biggest complaint are the lack of water initially and follow up afterwards.  We didn't get water until are appetizers were served.  There was never a follow up after any of the dishes were served.  This is pretty basic service for a fine dining establishment so I will not give you any leeway here.  

My other issue is more of a personal taste.  Mastro's is located in Crystals Shopping Center at CityCenter and has an \"open top\" feel with views of the mall.  The restaurant is not enclosed so it feels like I'm dining at a very expensive food court.  As with typical steak houses they are usually dark but here it's pretty bright.  I didn't feel like I had the full Mastro's steak house experience.

While I really enjoyed the food and time with my friends I'm not sure I will go back since Vegas has a lot of dining options."}
{"text":"24oz Rack of Lamb a bit undercooked, good value $48 but too much for one person. Twice baked potato enormous like $12 - too much cheese on too - potato was not dry thankfully didnt need butter - live entertainment not bad but a bit overpowering - server was cute and good."}
{"text":"We came here for our mothers day celebration. My wife liked it the last time we came to lv so we made a reservation to come back.  We are big fans of Maestros in west LA.  We ordered lobster bisque and caesar salad to share for starters.  The lobster bisque was the star of the whole dinner and the ONLY reason for the 3rd star.  It was really really good and to find real lobster in it was great.  The caesar salad was good and the fact that they portioned it out for us was a nice touch. We  two ribeye steaks for mains together with mac and cheese and creamed spinach.  We ordered our two steaks med rare and medium.  The steaks came out med and almost well done.  I had to give half of my steak to my wife since it was her day and she forbade me from complaining to the staff so I'm writing this review.  The creamed spinach was really good and the portions were generous.  The mac and cheese on the other hand was a huge disappointment - completely tasteless and gummy.  Service was good and they really did treat us well."}
{"text":"All of their locations are great. They have the best steaks west of Chicago, hands down. You pay alot but get your money's worth. Great side dishes & service. You MUST try profiteroles & or cherry cobbler. 
Enjoy this a great restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the best steak houses in town.  Only giving 4 stars because of their high pricing.  Overall - great food and atmosphere.  Superb place to go when hanging out with your friends."}
{"text":"Everything about his restaurant screams \"top notch\"!  I have always enjoyed everything I have ever ordered from this place!  Cocktails are \"hands down\" thee best, although I will sadly miss the best bartender I've ever come across....Cindi.  Salad, exquisite, steak melts like butter in your mouth, sushi to die for and dessert outstanding.  This place is THEE place if you are looking for a prime steakhouse in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really great place for seafood and salads.  Great option for a meal before any of the shows at Aria, MGM or other surrounding casinos.   Top notch service"}
{"text":"I will preface this review with the fact that family was in town and this dinner was free!

We had reservations for Saturday Night  at 8:30 pm for a group of 7. I am always leery of a restaurant that is in the middle of a mall. I don't care how fancy the mall is, I think mall food every time I dine at one. Mastro's my friends is no Mall Food Place.

The Service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while I'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. It was like they were our dedicated staff.

The meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).

The Bread basket was a good start, it had Pretzel Bread, olive bread, a Parmesan crisp, and few other breads. The sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. We had Creamed Corn (some of the best I've ever had), Creamed Spinach, Lobster Mashed Potatoes, King Crab Gnocchi, and Mushrooms. We also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 Caesars (one regular and one spicy), Tomato and Onion, and Tomato and Mozzarella. A seafood tower and crab cakes were also ordered, I'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it. 

They entrees were pretty stellar as well, I was splitting the 33oz Wagyu Tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, I had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things I have to do). This was one of the best pieces of Cow I've had in my life (and I've had A LOT of cow). It was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect IMO), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. I don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect. 

Table mates also got the Seabass, A Filet, and a few other meats, I was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their filets were about 12oz servings.

After dinner, they brought out a Warm Butter Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!

I have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. My only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. They did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.

Will I be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!"}
{"text":"Heard about Mastro's for a long time and finally had a chance to try it in Vegas.

This location is insides the Crystals @ Citycenter.  If you go to this location make sure to request to sit in the tree house (it's the giant wooden structure you see in the pictures), it's much more interesting then just sitting in the regular dining room.

The service was impeccable; water was always full, the plates and crumbs were constantly being cleared and the waiter was friendly.

Me and my wife shared the double cut porter house.  This thing was REALLY good, and was probably the best steak i've ever had at the time.  We were not even hungry and we ate half of it.   Took the rest to go and the next day i just straight up ate the leftovers straight out of the box (no fridge or microwave in the hotel room)."}
{"text":"My boyfriend made a reservation here for our Anniversary. And my oh my was I pleased! It was wonderful.

To start, it is very classy and nice. Beautiful interior décor. Fancy place settings.

The service is wonderful. Very professional and high class. You get what you pay for there.

The food was wonderful. I got salmon of course and loved it!

We told them it was our anniversary as well so they were nice enough to bring us a piece of cake and a candle lit!! So nice of them.  We left there stuffed.

This place is just marvelous. Loved it!! If I could afford to, I would go back every weekend."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's Birthday. 

The service was superb, a big thank you to Peter our waiter for dealing with such an unruly large party!

I had the Kansas City Strip Steak...was amazing. They use a great rub or some other seasoning. 

We started with a couple dozen Oysters which were fantastic, and not too expensive. All the sides were great, including the potatoes and spinach. 

Great wine selection, and its only 2X for certain bottles of wine. We had 3 bottles each around $100 but top vintages of some great wineries in Napa. 

I believe the birthday boy got a free desert of some kind, but at that point in the meal I was having to much fun to notice. 

This is a clean, fun, and delicious higher-end place to eat with friends. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I can think of no reason to give one more penny of my hard-earned money to Mastro's. Our anniversary dinner was supposed to be special - it wasn't.

Service was rushed. 
We were a two top at 5:15 - the waiter had the warmth of a stop sign; his demeanor rushed throughout the visit. An unsolicited 'reminder' about how entrees take 25 minutes upon delivery of our appetizer \"and to order soon' only signaled their wanting the table for another cycle, so we'd better hurry the fuck up!

Drinks are overpriced.
Two cocktails came to just under 50 bucks. A glass of wine with dinner was 23.

Stop pushing the seafood tower for Christ's sakes! 
We were two, not twelve. When I bring clients in, it's a consideration. Not a $300 pile of shellfish for two, however. I heard our server offering the damned thing to an eighty year-old couple seated next to us, thinking; \"Now just how - IN THE FUCK - are these two old codgers going to wolf down a hundred pieces of shellfish, pre-meal no less!\"

Oysters didn't taste fresh, making me wonder if they use canned oysters and re-use the shells like so many other chain seafood specialty restaurants.

\"Black truffled mushroom sauce\" an optional side for the steak topping, was anything but. It was white in appearance and had no detectable smell or taste of truffles - only high levels of sodium. For fifteen dollars, save your money. I had to scrape it off and loathe a little white pile of salted, shitty 'gravy' throughout the meal.

Lobster in their signature mashed potatoes were like bites from a rubber chew toy; overcooked and flavorless. (I think someone finally found the Busy Bee) Potatoes had a film of grease - butter I presume. Someone should have thought to give them a quick stir, like I had to do in order to make them visually pleasant enough to want to take a spoonful. Prior to my doing so, I watched as a small yellow puddle developed at the edge of the dish. 
This was concerning.

Wife's drink was returned twice, both times too strong - overpowering the cucumber in the martini. Bartender must confused her with Amy Winehouse I suspect.

Six ounce filet ordered Pittsburgh style - no detectable char anywhere. 
Wife's was ordered medium - nothing even mildly resembling pink.

If it wasn't for the tasty bread basket and plate of semi-soft butter, the dinner would have been a complete bust. 

We stopped at AJ's on the way home for dessert. 
After fooling us on every aspect of the meal, we weren't going to get fooled on another disappointing menu item. We skipped their dessert offerings.

When I told my wife this morning how the dinner was less than memorable for such an important anniversary, she disagreed, explaining; \"Negative experiences can be just as memorable as can good ones.\"
She's right.

When so many things go wrong as quickly as last night, ie; the returned drinks, the small flavorless oysters, the salted 'truffle' sauce, you (as in me) have to decide how many times you're going to send stuff back before it returns with a hidden present from the chef. 
I realize this isn't likely at Mastro's, but I didn't want to be deemed the 'difficult' couple at table 31  and take the chance of pissing off the staff. 

So we stopped sending stuff back after the drinks, took our lumps, and got the fuck outa there asap.

Goodbye Mastro's and good luck.
You will never have to endure another of my Yelp rants - unfavorable or otherwise."}
{"text":"One of the top 3 restaurants in Vegas! Third time coming here this year and I have never been disappointed. Service from the waitress was on point and she was very thorough with explaining the specials on the menu. The shrimp cocktail is probably the best I've ever had along with the lobster bisque.  I had the rack of lamb as my main course which was amazing. Black truffle gnocchi as a side is brilliant also. The one thing you cannot leave this restaurant without ordering is the legendary butter cake!!"}
{"text":"My wife took me here for my birthday and I enjoyed it.  I had the Porterhouse and my wife had the filet.  Not the best steak I have had, but still very good.  My wife enjoyed her filet.  We had a couple sides which were amazing.  Have music in the bar area, good place for a date."}
{"text":"Dined here after a show for wife's 60th birthday - a special day. Arrived earlier than our reservation and Concierge said party at our reserved table was just closing check. We headed to the bar for drinks and after 1/2 hour I went to inquire about the delay. A different concierge informed me the party was just getting dessert - what's the real story? Was getting late so we took another table and enjoyed dinner. Would expect better from a higher end dining establishment - Concierge never offered anything for the delayed seating. Several other restaurants along the Strip with comparable food and more attentive staff."}
{"text":"This is by far the best ribeye I have ever had! The only downside is the way you are welcomed and the atmosphere isn't as classy as I would like it to have been. When paying $50+ for a steak I don't like to feel rushed. I fealt that we were sort of being rushed since there were so many people waiting to be seated. Other than that, I loved the food."}
{"text":"Nom nom nommy noms. We were in Vegas for an anniversary trip and needed a place to indulge and Mastro's was a great choice. We made reservations a few days before and got a phone call to confirm. It's located in Crystal Shops at City Center which is connected to Aria. 
We were a bit early but were still seated as soon as we arrived. The restaurant from outside err inside the mall looks so cool and it's even nicer from inside. Very nice ambience which calls for a relaxing meal.
Now for the food:
The bread basket had only one bread i liked. Basic french bread...typical. Then we started with drinks. I knew I would be having wine as opposed to my typical cocktail while DH unusually ordered beer so we were living wild! I needed help with finding the right wine to pair with my meal and the waiter was very helpful. 
After tasting two wines, i settled for the Remy Pannier Chenin Blanc which was excellent with my Alaskan King Crab Legs. DH had the Alaskan Amber which was great with his meat haaaaaa. For sides, we went with Asparagus and Scalloped Potatoes. Both sides complimented the filet and crab legs and the meal was very tasty AND filling. To finish, we had the Creme Brulee and ice cream which were decadent. 
This was one of my favorite experiences in Vegas. To top it off, we received a call the next day thanking us for choosing them and asking how our experience was. I would love to stop by again our next visit to the Sin City!"}
{"text":"Mastros you were very disappointing. We were very excited to give this place a try because of the reviews that were given. 

First off the service was horrible. And keep in mind I'm not asking for you guys to bend over backwards to keep us happy, but the attitude needs a lot of improvement from the host to the server. 

I didn't keep that in mind for long because we were here for the food anyway and I thought the food will make up for it. We order the hamachi appetizer, which was the only decent tasting dish. We ordered the sea bass, rack of lamb and scallop. They were all just super basic dishes. It was literally just a protein with no sauce whatsoever! I could have done this at home and this would have tasted better at a local BJs. I expected much better from you guys. 

Then when we were about to leave I asked for a box so I could take the bread to go so that we could snack on it later. I got attitude and was asked twice am I sure I did not want to take the courses to go. There's a reason why we didn't ask for box to go and we obviously thought it was NOT good enough to take it to go, and I understand why our server gave us attitude. He thought we were wasteful, but the food sucked so just leave us alone and don't ask twice with an attitude. 

I would skipped this place if you're in Vegas, you can find much better places to eat around here. I understand sometimes it sucks to be working on a holiday or the weekend, but keep in mind we all work too and we spend good money to have a good meal out here too. We don't deserve any of this nasty attitude or food."}
{"text":"I went to Mastros during a trip to Scottsdale with my husband and some friends. This was by far one of the best meals I've ever had. The wait staff was attentive. The Martinis came with a shaker of extra drink. The food was delicious. I can't say enough how great this meal was. We will seek it out next time we travel."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner and was not impressed.  Had lamb chops and scalloped potatoes. The potatoes were half cooked and the lamb was bland"}
{"text":"For the most special of occasions, Mastro's Ocean Club is king of providing excellent service, food and atmosphere.  This has been my second time dining at Mastro's (first time for birthday, second for anniversary).  To say that they will raised the bar even on the second time dining, is quite impressive!
Entering Mastro's you are taken immediately to your table (reservations strongly recommended, especially if celebrating a particular occasion).  There is a bar area off to the left side, with ample seating, then to your right the general dining room area.  A private dining room is available for groups.

Your waiter or waitress promptly arrives at your table to welcome you ever so warmly to Mastro's.   Warm conversation is most certainly to be had, and most of all, it's sincere.  Mastro's really made us feel like royalty (even with many people around us sharing the same dining experience), and conversation was earnest with our waiter and friendly.

Mastro's boasts a variety seafood and steak dishes.  The highlight of this particular Mastro's being seafood; one cannot go wrong with their ever well stocked Mastro's Seafood Tower.  This tower is truly amazing!  It can be tailored for the amount of people in your group, and can include a variety of fresh seafood appetizers of your choosing.  Of particular deliciousness, are their crab and their jumbo shrimp cocktail.  Chilled to perfection, each bite is a seafood lover's dream.

For the main course, the 12 oz fillet is of most generous portion.  Any steakhouse in the area would be rivaled to Mastro's generous portion and taste.  Each bite (even with my being well-done) was juicy and flavorful.  Be sure to pair your steak with a vegetable and starch, which rounds out your meal perfectly.  Their steamed spinach is light, yet full of flavor.  The lobster macaroni and cheese is full of rich and creamy cheese, and portions of lobster meat mixed in.  This dish is extremely filling, but a unique experience for any macaroni and cheese lover.

To round out the evening, one cannot forget about their decadent desserts.  For this particular evening, their Signature Warm Butter Cake was a delivery from heaven!  This dessert is full of buttery and soft cake tastiness inside, along with a heaping scoop of vanilla ice cream to balance out the warm cake.

I look forward to my next trip to Mastro's Ocean Club.  Mastro's will truly pull out all of the stops to make your evening the most enjoyable in their surroundings and unforgettable dishes.  Check out Mastro's Ocean Club for your most special of occasions.  Mastro's locations can be found in Arizona, California, Nevada and Illinois."}
{"text":"Was a big fan of Mastros steakhouse so as soon as I heard about the Ocean Club I had to try it. I'm so glad I did. It is a wonderful restaurant. The cold seafood tower is delicious. The king crab and oysters were so fresh. The salads are so good, such great choices and unique variety. Great cocktails, wonderful bread, incredible service and the desserts are yummy too. Great central location in Kierland. Highly recommend this one for anyone is Scottsdale."}
{"text":"By far the best meal I had in Vegas. I had the crab cocktail, grilled swordfish, crab gnocchi, wild mushrooms, and the buttercake - of course. The crab cocktail was delicious, perfectly cooked sweet crab with a decent cocktail sauce. The swordfish was a little dry on the sides but perfectly cooked towards in inside. The mushrooms were fantastic and full of garlic and butter. The gnocchi was to die for, so delicious and creamy and oh so full of crab- they do not skimp out here. The buttercake was delicious. 

My largest complaint about Maestro's is the waitstaff. While they were very nice they were very pushy. They came 3 times in five minutes to ask if they could take our plates. It was probably around 6:30 and our plates were half full. There was no need for a rush."}
{"text":"Who's taking me to Ocean Club?  Anyone?

Holy Crap I was there last night for the first time and just had a few drinks at the bar with friends.  DEAR GOD if the food is anywhere near half as good as it smelled....  And I've heard that it is.

Extremely pricey and the bar was packed.  A little rowdy too for the age group there, definitely an older crowd...lots of cougar hunting going on by my 20-something guy friends.  Definitely more of a scene than, say, Capital Grille...louder, etc.

Loved the decor and the music (they had some dude singing but it wasnt obnoxious), not to mention the bathrooms are impecable and huge.  

I only wish I could give a review on the food but like I said, we didnt eat...  *sigh*  Maybe one day...."}
{"text":"I decided to make reservations here for my hubby's bday dinner and an early anniversary dinner as well! Our anniversary is a few days after his bday. I had let them know we were celebrating both occasions and gave us one of the best seats in the house! We sat in the tree house. Our server was Hooper and he was very imformative, proffesional, and even split all our food for us without being asked to! We Hooper brought us out their famous butter cake decorated with \"happy birthday\" and \"happy anniversary\"  The best part, they actually comped the dessert for our occasion! I have been to Mastro's in Chicago and I can honestly say that this location is nothing less than exceptional. Great food and great service with attention to detail. I am a true fan and can't wait to come back to this location next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I usually go to City Hall, but the service has been subpar lately, so I thought I would give Ocean Club a go. I was not disappointed. The service was amazing and the food was great and timed perfectly. We started with blue point oysters and jumbo shrimp cocktail. It was phenomenal. We continued with a filet and family sides. The whole experience was delightful. Unexpectedly the next day, Ocean Club called me and thanked me for dining with them! I have dined at City Hall many times and never received an after call. I will continue to go to Ocean Club!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here with his parents and the first point I'll make to get your attention is that our bill came out $450. Now that i've got your attention.

Service: One word excellent. I'd like to start off by saying that I came here for my 21st birthday and you know how usually you'll mention it to restaurants in hopes of getting something free and they'll come out with some weak bite sized dessert. My boyfriend's parents were the one who mentioned it and I quickly got a happy birthday and I expected nothing of it after. But for dessert I actually got a full on, very generous portion of a piece of chocolate cake (with raspberries!). It had come while I was in the bathroom so I wasn't expecting the waiter to relight it again but he actually did! The waiters were very nice, they made jokes and conversation (not just about food but where we were from, etc) They really knew their stuff, like not just knew what the specials were but they were very knowledgeable about their menu.

Food: For starters we ordered escargot, chilled seafood, and crabcakes. The escargot was probably the disappointment of the evening. I've had much better elsewhere. There was just no taste or not a great taste. It wasn't gross or anything but I've just basically tasted better marinated or sauced escargot. For the chilled seafood, you're allowed to pick however many pieces you want and what seafood you want on it. It came in this platter that had dry ice in it. The shrimp were so plump and juicy. The crab was the best part though. I don't even know how to describe it but my boyfriend and I were fighting for the last pieces, just popping them into our mouths one by one. 
-Rack of Lamb: So juicy! It was probably the best lamb I've ever had. The taste was there, it was perfectly cooked. 

Dessert: We ordered their signature cake and it was very unique. I don't think I\"ve ever tasted anything like it but I wasn't raving about it as much as the rest of my table were. It tasted like butterscotch or toffee angel/sponge cake. I couldn't really put my foot on what it was, it was just so different. 

Bathroom: This is actually the first bathroom I've been to where it had a bathroom attendant who handed you towels. They had tampons and other amenities on the counter. She opened and closed the door for me. It's too bad I didn't have my wallet to tip her but she was very nice. 

View: Where we were seated, you could basically look out into the mall and people watch. 

My boyfriend and I will definitely be back to this chain, maybe for an anniversary."}
{"text":"The experience was not unique and the ambiance where we were seated for reservation was awkward for a fine dining experience.  Not what you look for when you visit Las Vegas.  My lobster roll was ok as best and my wife's fish was just ok as well.  Drinks were good."}
{"text":"WOW. Best meal of my life.  

For being located in a mall this place very nice.  We had a very good bottle of red wine that paired well with the bone-in ribeye and lamb of rack.  Speaking of the ribeye was humongous and melted like butter.  The rack of lamb is actually 2 racks which the waiter kindly had the chef slice for me so I didn't have to feel like I was performing surgery in the middle of my date. This had to be the best lamb I've ever had.

The food was soo good that we made a special trip back to the aria before seeing Ka at the MGM.  (PS my feet paid the price)"}
{"text":"Just like the one in Bev Hills...needs no further explanation, everything is yum and oh that butter cake ending=happy ending"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite Steakhouses! Took my mom there for her birthday last week and it was amazing! Started off with a berry martini....delish!  For a starter i had the wedge salad you can never go wrong with the wedge :). As my main course i had the filet mignon which i absolutely love!!!!! Its so tender it melts in your mouth and the flavor is beyond amazing! Most restaurants don't know how to season their meats :/ Not Mastros. My mom was even amazed with the flavor of the filet. FYI my mom is a picky eater :/ actually so am I haha. We ordered three sides to share (the portions are pretty big just to throw out there). There was 4 of us In our party and we had lots of left overs. We had the Mac n cheese (a must have) creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms. Dessert time we had the butter cake. I swear this has to be the best dessert I've ever had... No joke! Once you start eating it you can't stop....its addicting!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! We go to Mastros in Scottsdale arizona very frequent and this location in Las Vegas was nothing but disappointment. Sent my steak back because it came out over done and then it came back cold. Their scalloped potatoes are my favorite, except at this location they were pure salt. Total disappointment. Don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"It was either a off night, or they were training a new steak cook.  I ordered my bone in rib eye medium and at best it was medium well.  My buddy's filet tasted like liver, that really strong iron taste.  Should have ordered the fish at a place called \"Ocean Club\".  Or next time I will stick to Wolfgang's Cut.  So disappointing.  Service was good.  Should have sent back my steak, but I hate wasting food."}
{"text":"been a few times and the vanilla crusted twin lobster tails are still amazing
also some of the best seared ahi I have ever had
great location inside crystals in the city center
look for the giant wood shaped tree house hovering in the air....thats it!!!"}
{"text":"This shall be short because Mastro's is just plain awesome.

Lobster Tails = Delectable
Creamed Spinach = Delish
Scalloped Potatoes = RICH! Very yummy cheeses in the dish
Ahi Tuna = Yum! 
Chocolate Cake = Da Bomb

Corkage Fee - $35.
Service = IMPECCABLE

This is our go-to place whenever we're in Vegas for an expensive dinner. The boyfriend goes here when he's in Scottsdale for business dinners. It's just fantastic.  A pretty penny, but amazing."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to eat here last Thursday night. We had a 7:15 reservation, but we didn't get seated until 7:35ish. It was busy, which is a good sign, but dang it was loud. The food was good, but not great. The filet was just ok, I could easily do it just as well if not better myself. I got the sea bass, which is i think their signature fish, and it was really average. I just st expected a lot more from a upscale expensive place like ocean club."}
{"text":"Came here last week for Las Vegas Restaurant Week and the menu was absolutely delicious! We had the tuna tartar, caesar salad, halibut, filet mignon, mushrooms, mashed potatoes, creamed corn and creamed spinach! For dessert I had the butter cake which was absolutely PHENOMENAL! My friend had the chocolate cake which was good too. I ordered a martini and it was so tasty, they even bring you the remaining in the martini shaker! Brandon was our server and was very professional, the bussers and water servers were so on point as well! Would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Im a local and this is probably my favorite restaurants in vegas. The staff is tentative and the food is great. The tomahawk steak, rib eye steak and Chilean (blackened) sea bass are my favorites. Of course no meal is complete without starting out with their crab cakes. Top 3 crab cakes I've ever had. The key lime for desert is a must have as well. I tell everyone I can about this place. Don't forget to mention if you are celebrating a special occasion."}
{"text":"We ate at Mastro's at their Los Angeles location earlier this year. The steaks that we had were the best that we had ever had. We were in Las Vegas during part of the Labor Day Weekend and had long decided to eat at the Vegas location in a shopping mall leading into Aria Hotel/Casino and in a tree house. We were staying at The Cosmopolitan Hotel it was a breeze to get to the restaurant.
We were seated immediately to our table as per our reservation. The server was very attentive and informative. I had a bone-in filet for dinner with garlic mashed potatoes and a dessert in the end. All of the above with a forever flowing bottle of red wine.
The steaks at Mastro's Ocean Club (Whether in Los Angeles or in Las Vegas) are dry-aged and prepared to perfection. The texture is so soft and buttery with the flavors bold and bountiful. I have to tell you that the term, \"Melts in your mouth\", can literally be used at this establishment and it would not be over stated. We paid a pretty penny for this meal as well however it was well worth all of it and then some."}
{"text":"I went here for a work dinner hoping to find a good seafood restaurant In Las Vegas but left very upset with both the dining experience and the quality of the food. 

The food: we started out with some alacarte cold seafood. I had the oysters which to my surprise was only served with a cocktail sauce -  not vinegar. A shame for otherwise good oysters. My colleague had the burrata with the heirloom tomatoes, but the cheese was more like mozzarella and the tomatoes un-ripe and hard.

For our mains we went with the seafood - I had the sea-bass (blackened) and to my surprise it  was drenched in butter and tasted more of butter than the fish I was expecting. My colleague had the swordfish - which was overcooked, and cold by the time it came out.

The service: the service was non-attentive and several times the staff walked by not noticing our empty glasses or asking if we would like another drink. 

When we got both our apps and our mains the staff served us the wrong courses- we all got each-others dishes.

Lastly - Once dessert rolled around (we had ordered two deserts to share) -we only got two plates which was very inconvenient. After once again waiting for the staff to come around and not noticing we had not started eating, we managed to get some plates brought out - albeit - the plates were hot and miserably watched the ice cream melt as it hit the sizzling plates.

Overall we left Maestros pretty upset with the experience and the food - especially considering we brought our client here for a fun evening.

Follow up: the following day I received a follow up call asking how we found the experience - I told the caller about the experience and I had a manager try to reach out to me after. I will post an update here after I get in touch with them again."}
{"text":"I did not get to enjoy my meal as much as I wish... =( but I know for a fact that the food was really good..

Me & my girl friend (Amy L) made reservations for 6PM on a Saturday. After dragging ourselves over here from Vdara, we finally made it on time. It was an absolute drag because we were awake for 30+ hours & we felt really crappy from all the \"beverages\" we consumed... basically we felt like utter sh** and couldn't enjoy our meals =(

Located in the City Center, the restaurant is pretty much in the very center of the building. Service was good but a bit slow. I love the assortment of bread, my favorite is the crunchy cheesey-garlicky one =)

Here's what we ordered:

Lobster Bisque - comes in a huge bowl, tastes very very VERYY rich, not too many pieces of lobster but still pretty delicious

Seared Sea Scallops - I've had this before at Mastro's in Beverly Hills, same thing, still delicious, comes with 3 scallops & yummy cheese/garlic bread. Scallops from Mastro's comes in 2nd place after Providence's :P

 Bone-in Filet - cooked medium. Comes on a sizzling plate, very good rich flavors and good texture. I was only able to eat 2-3 bites. I did eat the leftovers the next morning & it was still pretty tasty. 

Chilean Sea Bass - blacken cajun flavored, I think.. It was pretty damn good, texture is very similar to scallops.

King Crab Gnocchi - big enough to be an entree on it's own, holy sh*t, I don't know how this thing can just be a side dish lol it's meant to be shared amongst 4+ people.. I thought it was pretty yummy, I love cheese and king crab meat... but this is super duper heavy, I probably would not order this again...

Garlic Spinach - tasty but a bit too garlicky for me, it was so infused with garlic that it tasted a bit bitter to me..


I am so sad that we were so full that I didn't get to try to butter cake, AGAIN! =( We didn't have much of an appetite at all, plus I think we ordered a little too much lol... we were stuffed after having a few bites of our appetizers.  Service was good, our waiter was a bit slow though. Our water glasses were never empty (thank goodness, we must have drank a total of 13 glasses each..)

Restrooms are located on the second floor, kind of a hassle to look for. Bad idea to go when you're intoxicated..



Lesson learned: do not attempt fine dining after a night of debauchery....excellent restaurant & food! Must try the butter cake one day.... =("}
{"text":"Impeccable.  Awesome.  Tasty.  

We come here every year for special dinners, and of all places in Vegas, THIS place is our favorite.  Amazing structure to dine in, such a good menu.  Impeccable top to bottom."}
{"text":"Exceptional experience from start to finish. Our server, Sam, was impeccable from the moment we were seated. Staff is coordinated in their approach and teamwork to make your dining experience flawless. Food was excellent: Swordfish and rack of lamb were our selections accompanied with two plentiful sides. High marks for Mastro's!"}
{"text":"Surprised my wife with a trip to Vegas for our anniversary.  Stayed at Palazzo and have eaten at Craftsteak, Cut, Delmonico, and being from Chicago, we know our way around our Beef (Nine, Gene and Georgetti's, Gibsons, Chicago Chop House, Keefers, Kinzie...).  Considered return to Cut, booked and unbooked Carnevino and Prime before settling on Mastro's because of our evening plans (Mandarin Oriental for drinks) and because we've wanted to try the newbie here in Chicago.  

Request, and wait for if necessary, the tree house dining.  

Mike R (ASK FOR HIM, HE'S THAT GOOD) did an excellent job with the pacing of our meal.  He knew it was our anniversary and he made sure to congratulate us several times, chat us up without being intrusive, and sincerely took an interest in making our experience pleasurable.

Wife had the bone in Filet (12 oz) and I had the bone in Rib eye...plate, ordered the au gratin potatos to share (our server Mike R recommended one side to share due to the size) and the meal was worth every single of the five stars we are giving this place.    

For our anniversary, they treated us to their signature butter cake.  We were stuffed but did our due dilligence....very tasty, very good, and if you actually save room for it, worth ordering. 

Upon reflection, this was a perfect destination to celebrate an anniversary.  Live music was noticable, but not intrusive, the tree house, particularly when the sun went down, created a very romantic atmosphere.  Have read complaints about the setting (basically in the middle of the mall) but I don't share those complaints.  Yes, you are in a mall, albeit a mall the average person can walk through but not afford to shop in, but you hardly notice the people honestly.  Saw many people enjoying either bottles of wine (like us...oh, and yes the list has some mark up and bottles you would have to mortgage your home to afford, but also some very reasonably priced, well worth the mark up bottles to be enjoyed ... ) or their signature cocktails which were generous pours and will be on \"the list\" next time we visit.  

But I have to come back to Mkie R, he was a throwback, a restaurant professional who knows the food, knows the wine list, knows the importance of making your feel as though he is there only to make your experience memorable.  I am not kidding, REQUEST him when you visit, you will write me and thank me profusely if you do.  

We return to Vegas in September...will definitely drop by for drinks and desert at minimum."}
{"text":"When you are looking for an incredible meal, look no further then Mastro's Ocean Club located in the Crystals Shopping Mall at the City Center. 

I started with the jalapeño tuna sashimi. I loved this dish. Thin slices of tune w just the right amount of jalapeño made each bit the perfect amount of spicy. Only down side was the dish was a bit oily. 

For my entree I went w the Sea Bass. I can't express enough.. this was hands down the best Sea Bass I've ever had. 

Last but definitely not least.. I finished w the famous Mastro's Butter Cake. Mind blown. It gets better every time."}
{"text":"This place is still a 4 to 4 1/2.  Pricey but great food and service.  The steaks, lobster tail, and sea bass were all worthwhile.  They have a nice bar that you can grab a drink at before dinner and the music they play live is nice.  Typically, standards.  Leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Decided to have a nice dinner with my husband and everyone recommended to come here.  We were both really excited and wanted to a enjoy a nice dinner even knowing that it would be pricey.  The server was very nice and a great salesman.  He knew exactly to recommend the most expensive items on the menu.

The bread basket is amazing!!!
I think the drinks are WAY too expensive especially with the Vodka that they offer, $18 for a martini with SKY vodka is ridiculous!

Ordered:
18 oz Bone in Filet Mignon - Medium
Lobster mashed potatoes
Mushrooms
and Truffle Fries
Note - side orders are really big and are family style.

Results:
Our steak even with the bone did not look 18 oz (not even close) our steak came rare, we sent parts of it back to cook just for a couple of more seconds and got it back totally well done and gross.  The Lobster mashed potatoes were ok and NOT worth $39 as you barely tasted the lobster and all you tasted were massive amounts of butter.  I would have been happy with garlic mash.  The mushrooms were amazing and probably the tastiest item we ordered.  The really expensive fries were soggy and didn't have much flavor at all.

The manager was nice enough to not charge us for the overly cooked steak but it was quite disappointing to go to specialty restaurant where they don't know how to cook their meat the right way.   Even after they took off the meat the bill came out to $140 and it was totally not worth it.  Very disappointed in our experience here."}
{"text":"Plenty of reviews already so I am going to jump right into it. For sure make reservations if you want to sit in the tree house. We did and we loved it! Waiter was really nice and explained the menu to us while suggesting very popular items. 

For appetizers we started off with the \"Oyster Rockefeller\" and \"Sauteed Shrimp\".
The oysters were not bad but let's just say we won't order them again. The shrimp on the other hand were very delicious. Had great seasoning and the creamy butter sauce was pretty amazing.

Main course le boyfriend and I each both had the \"22oz Bone in Ribeye\". And for sides we did the \"Lobster mashed, Cream corn & Sauted mushrooms\". Both steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection. \"Seriously best steak I've ever had in my life\"... those were the boyfriends words since this was my first time in over a year eating red meat. But I have to agree with him. The lobster mashed potatoes were so creamy and buttery. Cream of corn was very tasty, almost reminded me of the mexican corn with out all the cheese. The sautéed mushrooms were also very delicious. Very happy with the entrees and sides we got. I fell in love with all of them.

Las but not least, DESSERT!. 
Waiter brought us out a chocolate piece of cake with fresh whipped cream. I did not care so much for this cake as it was a little on the dry side for me but eh it was complimentary for our Anniversary. I knew I had to order the famous Butter Cake so I did. The butter cake came out super warm with a big scoop of ice cream on top. Okay so this cake was good but I feel like I've had better dessert. I hate salt on any dessert so this was a huge downfall for me. Cake tasted like a very sweet, buttery corn bread. I don't know how to make out of this cake but if I go back I probably won't order it again. Yes I know very sad as everyone literally worships this cake. Over all I had a great experience and I cannot wait to go back again. I think this is my new favorite steak house."}
{"text":"Awesome fish and wine list.  Service top notch and a first class place.  They could use some musical talent."}
{"text":"Typical high-end steak place format. The location in City Center is unique, in the wooden \"treehouse\".
Highlights were potatoes gratin, creamed corn, and grilled asparagus. 
The bananas foster cocktail is like a rum desert.
Of course the service is upscale as expected. 
I have been to Mastro's locations in Orange County and here, both were consistently good."}
{"text":"Fab!

Make a reservation and sit in the 'treehouse.'

I was a bit concerned when I read reviews because I am a HUGE fan of the LA location but everything was GREAT! 

Who knew items from the Seafood Tower can be served warm?!?! Pre-cracked Crab Legs? 2lbs heated up please!

The 12oz Petit Filet was devine.

Gnocci with Truffle and Crab, Shrimp Scampi, Sweet Potato Fries... Oh boy!

The staff was also very aware of show times and kept asking to ensure we did not miss our show."}
{"text":"So I have to say starting out I am a Mastro's Ocean Club fanatic! I decided to spend Valentine's day dinner here because oddly enough I live in Las Vegas and never been to one of my favorite hotel chains? What better else day to try it out right? Booked my reservation through opentable.com and actually because of the level of high priority reservations, I had to put down a credit card just to hold my spot. Reservation was for 9PM and once we arrived we were seated immediately which was great because I was starving! Things started off a bit rough for the experience but they made things right and THAT's the part that counts. I know what the quality of food should look and taste like because I dine at the one in Beverly Hills all the time. So for our order we went with the Tomhawk for 2 which was running for $115 and added on a lobster tail ($36) to go with it. The steak is obviously sharing size but the cool part is that they can cook it to the temperature of what each person would like. I am more of the medium and my partner is medium well. So when the steak came out it was incorrect and we asked to have blue cheese crust added which didn't get added and the mac n cheese came out sub par as well, very dry with just no taste! Not sure what the chef was thinking last night but anyways. The fact that I was able to pull the manager aside and address my concerns with the presentation of my meal left me satisfied because he actually cared and fixed it. I commend the him and the staff for going above and beyond to make things right. My Valentines Day meal will now be memorable! Shot Out To Dan! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Yes wow - the service was amazing only topped by the food. My steak was the best I have ever eaten - I will now dream of this steak, and compare all future steaks to this one!!! Class setting and wonderful night!"}
{"text":"Very romantic atmosphere with live music in the bar area (you can also eat dinner there) with superb service & excellent food.

My hubby & I went to Mastros Sunday night to celebrate his birthday.  Everything is a la carte (and very large portions)...so, we split a cesar salad (average but not disappointing in anyway), swordfish (I loved it, but my husband who is very picky thought it was too fishy) , 12 oz filet mignon (great cut of meat cooked to perfection), garlic mashed potatoes (very tasty, maybe a little gluey) and sauteed broccoli (tasty, but boring...we've had the sauteed snap peas before and they are better).  They put a small piece of dry ice in the bottom of my martini glass and my cosmo had a little dry ice smoke...loved that.

Since it was his birthday, they brought out a slice of chocolate cake with a candle.  The cake was damn good.  

Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful.  He was very professional...the entire wait staff was on point.  They took very good care of us.  

BTW, there is an attendant in the bathroom...so bring a dollar with you if you want to be able to tip."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely perfect. Service, food, atmosphere. Love, love, loved it.

My MIL always says that the first sign of a really fancy restaurant is that if you request a black napkin (to avoid the white lint on your clothes of course), they don't bat an eye and bring you one immediately. Well, at Mastro's, we didn't even have to ask - as we sat down our white napkins were removed and black ones were draped across our laps. Superb start.

Our waiter was both professional and friendly - we really enjoyed the service here.

The food was excellent, and too much of it of course! We wanted to try so many things that there was no way we could really eat it all. 

And, they brought out a complimentary, decadent desert for my 30th birthday to end the night.

We drank and ate our way to belly bulging bliss...ready for club XS after this!"}
{"text":"OMG! Where do I start. The Customer service 
is great. I came here for my 5th Year Anniversary. 
The atmosphere was beautiful. They made a lovely
Anniversary menu for us. The food was Delicious. I 
had Roasted chicken & garlic mash, Brussels sprouts
Mmmm, so good my Husband had a Ribeye steak 
mouth watering he said. Just perfect. The end of 
our dinner they presented us with a cake how sweet
was that. Thanks for making our special day 
memorable."}
{"text":"We read the reviews and thought would be a great place for dinner. The live music was so LOUD we could barely talk to each other and we were jammed into a table that had to be moved so we could sit there and still felt like we were bumping into our neighbors. The first waiter that showed was excellent but the second was clearly a jerk. How can this be at a premium restaurant?  I ordered a steak medium and it was grey and overcooked and the 1lb potato was under cooked. My wife's sashimi was good but for these prices, never again."}
{"text":"A very classy restaurant, expensive but worth every single penny... The service is one of the highest First night my waiter was Nick and second was Tim very nice and attentive... Highly recommended this restaurant The food the drinks the dessert the service I don't have anything negative to say my birthday dinner was totally successful.... The cocktail DREAM BERRY is the best and sweet the creme brûlée.. Thank you Mastro's keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"GREAT food, bad execution. 

Took my girlfriend to Mastro's Ocean Club last night for her birthday. My parents and I had been there for their anniversary last year, and because of some snafus with the service, Mastro's had thoughtfully provided a gift card for a return visit. The gift card was then given to my girlfriend as a sort of re-gift present. 

Upon arrival, we were seated immediately, and provided everything we ordered with speed and efficiency. In-all, the food was excellent. Too excellent, as it turned out. After our appetizer and soup course, both of us were pretty much full. She was (with much difficulty) able to finish her steak, whereas I was able to consume about a bite-and-a-half of my bone-in ribeye. We basically didn't touch either of the side-dish that we ordered. Dessert was thoughtfully provided to her, as it was her birthday, again which we touched very little. 

Each time our wait staff cleared our table, I informed them clearly that I would be taking whatever remained home with me. That the food was wonderful, but that there was simply too much of it. So imagine my surprise when I went to grab some of the steak and side-dishes for lunch today, only to discover that they weren't there. In fact, with the exception of the dessert, and the remains of one salad, none of our leftovers were sent home with us. Probably a good...$75 wasted. 

The food is amazing, but after my parents' issues, and now this, I will probably not be returning to Mastro's again."}
{"text":"First off, location, location, location.  While it has the name, with this spot inside a shopping mall, you know something else make up for it.  Unfortunately with the rather loud \"Billy Joel wannabe\" pianist playing all night, and the shoppers strolling by looking at your dining selection, this place does not rate as well as it should.  

While the service was outstanding, the quality was mediocre when comparing it to other similar, better located, places in Vegas.  Price hurts a little too...guess the uberMall rents are high so the costs need to be passed along to the diners.

Since service is one half of a successful dining experience, this is what saved it from garnering a single star.

If you are looking for convenience and staying at Aria or Vdara, you could try this place....or you could walk a little further to other higher end dining experiences."}
{"text":"I've been a big protagonist of Mastro's since I first visited their Beverly Hills location almost four years ago. That visit was hands down my greatest overall dining experience with the service and all things considered. Since that visit, I've been here to the Ocean Club twice... both times were special occasions made very unspecial with the experiences here.

I'm not sure if the Beverly Hills location is just so far ahead of everyone else, or perhaps Mastro's being bought out not too long ago was the cause for a dip in overall quality, but I just don't feel the same about this place. 

There's nothing imaginative or cutting edge about the menu here. It's typical steakhouse fare... beautiful cuts of prime beef, lobster mashed potatoes, king crab gnocchi, louie salads, seafood towers, butter cake and overpriced cocktails. Among your big hitting steakhouses, execution of the chef and service is what will set you apart. 

To my disappointment, Ocean Club LV just doesn't stand out. Both times I've been, the last visit being last month, the service didn't stand out like my first visit to Mastro's. 

When I came for my best friend's bachelor party weekend, three... THREE of our 5 steaks were severely undercooked. We got black and blue ribeyes, and they just re cooked the same steaks we had already cut into and gave them back to us. Pretty laughable for any establishment, let alone one that is supposedly of the highest quality.

Came with my fiancée the second time and the service was SO slow. Our waiter was not at all attentive and very difficult to track down the entire night."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times prior. This time the service was good but the entrees were just average.  My wife had the sea bass and I had the bone in ribeye. The bass was okay but lacked flavor. My ribeye was perfectly cooked but was probably the leanest ribeye I have ever eaten.  Good flavor just needed more fat like a good ribeye should have."}
{"text":"The food is great & the portions are generous.  I had the tuna tartare & the twice baked potato & my boyfriend had the filet & sweet potato fries.  This place never disappoints!  I always look forward to eating here & the one back home in LA."}
{"text":"Impeccable service every time I go and amazing food. You can't go wrong with anything you order, especially the martinis"}
{"text":"The food is great (especially the lobster bisque) but for the price I wasn't really feeling the location of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay so last night I went on a date the place was nice service was good but 1 would not give 5 stars 4 okay we ask Sautee shrimp for an appetizer Delicious flavor was good shrimp were HUGE great then we ordered our ceasar salad not the best it had some kind of bad flavor to it.. Like seafoodish  and i must of ordered just the wrong meals because it was okay but NOT 5 stars"}
{"text":"Any trip to Mastro's is always a good one!! The food and drinks are always perfect!!"}
{"text":"In a city full of excellent restaurants Mastro's Ocean Club is too-shelf. Great selection of beef and fish served by an attentive wait staff. We've also gone to group dinners there and they did a wonderful job for 40 guests."}
{"text":"Called in to ask of I can wear sneakers.. the lady said yes! So.. I went in for an amazing birthday dinner..  Steak Filet,  lobster mashed potatoes,  and green beans with a nice glass of wine. Finished with a delicious chocolate cake with a single lit candle.. 
 with freshly whipped cream in a side dish! Heaven!  My waiter with his beautiful smile knew exactly what I needed on my special day! Never had to ask for a thing. His eye contact let me know.. he understood it was MY day! He spoiled me...
Thank you so much. Food was amazing, service exceptional,  the restaurant was beautiful,  peaceful yet elegant!  I loved it and can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Mastro's is among the best steak houses in the country. I like the prime filet. The seafood tower
Is spectacular."}
{"text":"I came here for my Birthday. The food was very impressive and so damn good!!! The pretzel bread they serve is the best!! Our Appetizers were crab cakes and ahi tostadas(these were just okay I've had better :/) I ordered the Sea bass lots of flavor juicy on the inside and a great crunchy crust on the out. My BF had the Lobster, juicy and buttery. Sides were mashed potatoes and green beans all yummy!! And they brought me out a birthday cake that I inhaled!!! 
You definitely get what you pay for.."}
{"text":"On my third trip to Vegas, my main priority was not to get sht-face wasted and it was not to shop until I dropped, but rather it was to eat in a treehouse. And that I did! I was sooo excited to try Mastro's (Mah-stro's or May-stro's?) after hearing ridiculously good things about this place. I made reservations online, and called ahead to request a seat in the treehouse. 

Service is impeccable here! Everyone was super nice and friendly. We started with the lemon drop dry ice martini and it was possibly the coolest (pun intended) alcoholic drink I've ever had! The dry ice fizzles over the top and there is a mini tornado in your martini glass!! It tasted great as well! Perfect blend of sweet and tart - with, of course, a kick of alcohol!

To eat, I ordered the filet mignon and we split truffle gnocchi, lobster mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas as sides. My steak was perfectly cooked, silky and tender. The gnocchi and mashed potatoes took it over the top to glutton overload. Those dishes are soooo richhhh and decadent and creammmyyy. Yum. I definitely think I gained 10 pounds that night. 

Bad for your waistline, bad for your wallet, but great for your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Two vegetarians walk into a steakhouse and walk out thinking, \"That was the best meal I've had in Vegas!!\" So what happened?

After spending the day hiking in Utah and then driving 4 hours back to Vegas, we were tired, disheveled, and hungry. It was our last night in Vegas. My dad had raved about Mastro's mac n' cheese for years. So we decided to have some for dinner! 

I admit, I was a little worried that we wouldn't be treated well, being that we were not ordering high priced steaks or seafood. That was definitely NOT the case. We had extremely attentive, first class service the entire time. We decided to eat in the bar so we wouldn't take a table away from steak lovers, and since we were more casual. There was live music, which was loud but not impossible to talk over. 

Our waitress was just awesome. She explained to us that the portions of the sides were huge and we definitely could share. We appreciated this since we didn't need leftover food. We ordered mac n' cheese, asparagus, and drinks. I had the paloma, a grapefruity drink. It was good! Not overly sweet. My friend loved her berry lemonade. Bread was brought out and was very fancy! There were different kinds of rolls, crackers, breadsticks, and pretzel sticks. Very yummy! 

Our meals came out and WOW... the sides were huge! Our waitress served us everything... and whenever we finished, she came to refill our plates. Very classy! We ordered pomegranate martinis on the way through our meal and again... WOW. They were amazing! Order one! They come in a shaker, and are poured table side. There is enough for more than one. The waitress came over and refilled our glasses as needed too. 

We finished every single bite of the mac n' cheese and asparagus. And were full. Too full for dessert. The meal was $100! I can only imagine what it would be with steaks. But it was $100 worth it. 

This would be the first place I'd come back to eat at in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm sure the entrees were delicious, but in this outing I was in a fast so all I had was vegges and water.  Now on the other hand everyone I was with at the table which was about 20 people loved their entree.  Next time I will indulge."}
{"text":"Must visit if you're in Vegas. Great atmosphere, great service & awesome food. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"We went there for our anniversary. We usually do not eat at a $$$$ resturant, but it was a special occasion. The menu has wonderful choices for seafood and steaks. Our waiter Austin was the best part of our meal. He was informative about our questions of the steaks and side dishes. Austin even brought us out a delicious chocolate cake for our anniversary,  as a surprise! We enjoyed our meal very much, but we probably wouldn't go back, just because of the expense."}
{"text":"This is one of the most interesting (fancy) places I have ever dined at. The restaurant itself sits in the middle of the Crystals City Center retail area. We were seated in the treehouse-esque area so had a nice view of retail shops and passersby. Service was prompt without being stuffy. Some menu items are $$$$ so be prepared. Sides are rather large so maybe share with your group. This is a great special occasion type of place."}
{"text":"This review is not going to be that long because everything can be very simply put. My wife and I got the filet mignon, it was the best we have ever had hands down. The mashed potatoes were fantastic when they were hot, once they cooled down they were kind of hard. The calamari was the best we have ever had, and the shrimp cocktail was amazing. They brought us out a complimentary chocolate cake for our anniversary, which was great. To top it off the next day they called us to thank us for coming in and asked us if everything was good. Impeccable service, and amazing food this place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing.  We spent our anniversary dinner here.   The food was amazing, and the service was top notch.  We had sautéed shrimp as an app, and split the bone in filet, garlic mashed and 2 lobster tails.  All was great, but he highlights....
    1.  The sautéed shrimp was one of the bet things I have ever eaten.  Perfectly cooked.  And the sauce was to die for.  It came with soft garlic bread to sop up the sauce.  I would have been happy with this for my entire meal.  
   2.  I got lobster tail two ways, but the vanilla fried was amazing.   
 
   Lastly and maybe most important was the dessert.  I am it a huge dessert fan, and we probably wouldn't have ordered dessert if it wasn't for them offering it for free for our anniversary.   We are fans for life.   I think they call it butter cake.   It was insane.   We had leftovers and ate it for breakfast.   Soooo good."}
{"text":"*** Word of warning: this steakhouse is located inside a mall and you will most likely have a view of a high-end store while you eat. *** 

Typically, I'm a huge fan of Mastro's and every time we are celebrating a special occasion, we will pay a visit to Mastro's. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed in the Vegas location. 

I will start with the pros. The food was sublime. It was exactly the quality of food Mastro's provides at their locations in Phoenix. I started with the Ocean Club Salad which came with fresh shrimp with blue cheese dressing, avocado and tomatoes. The salad was refreshing and delicious and filled me up! However, I wasn't done just yet. Following the salad, I ordered the crab cake and shared the lobster mac and cheese with my husband. The crab cake was made of fresh crab and was more crab than filling which was perfect. The Lobster Mac and Cheese is always a must and you can't visit Mastro's without ordering it! I also stole a bite of my husband's filet which was cooked to perfection. Yes, I did roll out of the restaurant but rolled out fat and happy from the amazing food! They cook everything to perfection and it's always a gluttonous good time. 

So why the three stars? Sadly, that goes to ambiance and service. The restaurant in located inside a mall. Granted, it's a very high-end mall but it's still a mall just the same. That wouldn't make a huge difference except that the restaurant has an open floor plan with an open balcony which means you are looking out into the mall while you eat. It's very light and bright and just doesn't provide for a very romantic experience. They do have a tree-like structure that you can eat in which hides the mall a little bit, but it's hard to forget that you're in a mall during your meal. Considering that it's Vegas and there are so many venues with wonderful ambiance, I would choose another restaurant next time. 

The customer service was also a bit disappointing. I felt like we were always trying to get our server's attention. He wasn't very attentive to us and anytime we wanted to order another drink or food, we had to hunt him down. We were going to order dessert but it took him so long to check on us that by the time he came to our table, we were just ready to go at that point. I would have liked it if the server was a bit more attentive so that we didn't have to track him down the whole meal. 

While the food was amazing, the ambiance and service left something to be desired and since Vegas has so many restaurants to choose from, we will choose a different restaurant during our next visit to the Strip."}
{"text":"There were 7 of us for dinner.. What we all loved was the personal recommendations from the servers.. From the drinks to the apps to the entrees.. It was pricy, but it was worth it! We got the seafood tower, lots of steaks and recommended sides.. And a free birthday cake/ice cream.. That was amazing... 

We all enjoyed ourselves, everything was great!"}
{"text":"We searched so many fine steak houses. Most were four stars and just a few were 4.5.  
Starting with the bar it was a great experience. Huge selection and fat pours.  Our bartender knew her sprits well and we did some taste testing.. And learned some things too. 
The service was great. Everything we asked for was prompt and accurate.  
Food was delish. Bone marrow apps.. Yum.  My steak was perfectly aged and well marbled. 
Everyone at our table was praising me about my selection of this place! 
The bill was reasonable.
The extra bonus of course was that we were not treated like rubes the way Gordon Ramsay Steak does. It was so nice not hearing about the \"Hell's Kitchen special\" five time before you cane get a word in."}
{"text":"Any chance we can get a date night, we visit one of the Mastro's restaurants.  It's our favorite place in Scottsdale for a relaxing night out without kids.    Great steaks and halibut.    Not recommended for families with kids but perfect for special occasions or when you want a nice night out."}
{"text":"Excellent service from start to finish!  Wife's crab cocktail and filet were perfect.  I was a little disappointed in my bone in New York.  Meat had a large vein of gristle  running through the  middle into the bone.  Martini was larger than average!!"}
{"text":"Before I write a review on the food, I need to give a big shoutout to Patrick Donahue, our waiter and his wait staff. Patrick and his team provided excellent service to our table!

I came to Mastro's with 14 clients and everyone was raving about the service and the food. 

Patrick gave us excellent descriptions on all the different kinds of shell fish available. He knew what oysters were  more mild than others, where they came from, and he did a great job putting 4 different seafood towers together. I highly recommend the seafood tower if you like shell fish - everything tasted so fresh!

I had the Chilean Sea Bass, and it was the best piece of fish I've ever had! Growing up in New England my whole life, I've had some really good seafood but nothing as good as this Chilean Sea Bass (blackened). 

Everyone else either had the Chilean Sea Bass or some kind of Steak. Everyone loved their food and said the steaks were cooked to perfection. 

 Dining at Masteo's is more than just dinner, it's an experience you won't forget!

I also have to give a shoutout to Tanya, the  event planner. Tanya did an excellent job coordinating our reservations and preparing us for the evening.

Thank you to everyone at Mastro's!

- Kevin"}
{"text":"A huge thanks to Brandon (manager) and Marc (server) for making my bf's birthday a night to remember!!! The service was amazing and the food was delicious. We enjoyed the oysters Rockefeller, halibut and the filet, along with the peas, and a few drinks. I loved the berry cocktail and the after dinner chocolate cocktail!! Marc ended our special celebratory evening with a slice of chocolate cake (which is my bf's favorite!) and a birthday candle. Everything about the restaurant is top notch!! Look forward to going back on our next visit to Vegas. Thanks again to the entire staff that made the night so special. :)"}
{"text":"If there was a choice to put 10 stars, id so rate it a perfect 10!!!!

Everything was perfect, eventhough its pricey, but definitely worth every penny!!!!"}
{"text":"Good seafood restaurant here at crystal mall Las Vegas. And I really love drink here they're call Mastro's Lemon Drop and Dream Berry serve with dry-ice that so cool."}
{"text":"Thanks to a coworker's recommendation and fellow Yelpers, we had a wonderful Christmas dinner here. We requested the Tree House area and it's where you want to sit. We had a drink at the bar while waiting to be seated and Randy served up an awesome Lemon Drop martini for me and a Key Lime Pie martini for my wife. We had the grilled salmon and ahi tuna sashimi, so good. And as many before me have said here, the signature butter cake dessert is phenomenal. Finally, a comment about service. Kudos to the entire staff and management are due. We walked up to the hostesses and we were welcomed by big smiles. Then off to the table, from the bar, and the hostess carried the drinks for us. Robert, our waiter, and a host of other men with bread and water and what ever we needed made this one special dinner experience. Thank you and see you again soon."}
{"text":"Love the Ocean Club! Lobster Mashed Potatoes! Doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"Hand's down, some of the best seafood I've ever had.   Everything was fresh and excellently prepared.  The sides are great for sharing and it's definitely worth it to take the plunge for the lobster mashed potatoes.  The service was exceptional and the interesting martinis were a treat!  Great people watching with it being located in a fashion mall in Las Vegas as well."}
{"text":"The N9ne is much better....I've had better at Red Lobster and that's sad...save your money or go to the N9ne at the Palms"}
{"text":"Second time to eat here, almost exactly one year apart from each other--both times for a bachelor party.  We actually had the same waiter both times.  This place is fantastic.  We had a seafood tower for the appetizer with all kinds of incredibly fresh items (dungeness crab, two types of oysters, lobster, shrimp, snow crab, etc.).  You can get that made to fit a particular price point per person.  The scallops were incredible.  The wine selection is great.  Highly, highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I just ate here for the second time last week.  We were on a short vacation from the east coast.  We had loved this restaurant the first time and have been talking about the chocolate cake dessert for the previous two years.  Well the second time around was as good if not better.  Wonderful margarita cocktail, steak, fish, sides and of course dessert - chocolate cake and the butter cake.  We were enjoying the leftovers for a couple of days.  Will definitely come back here next time we are in Scottsdale.  Many good restaurants in the Kierland area."}
{"text":"took some clients here for a business dinner after reading some reviews from other yelpers.  the meal was jaw dropping to all of us!

started with a seafood tower, which featured some excellent, fresh tasting selections.  continued with one of the best caesar salads i've ever tasted, then a great bone-in ribeye.  i highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes as a side.  

everyone else reported high marks on their entrees; i also tried another person's scallops entree.. unbelievably good.  if i ever return, would probably choose that as main course.

bottom line, i dont think you can go wrong here.  we ordered a LOT of food, and all of it was stellar."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with their steak, our group had an array of steak, rib eye bone in, rib eye, filet mignon, and a salmon dish. Granted it's Mastro's ocean club, their salmon was excellent, but their steak. Egh, dry not too flavorful. Service was excellent, we sat upstairs in our own room which was lovely.  However the service did not make up for the food. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good food , great customer service, beautiful location, nice atmosphere but damn well pricey. 

You will pay for each and every second you spend inside the place :)

PS: the bread is delicious"}
{"text":"Fiancé and I been here a couple of times and we absolutely loved it. staff is friendly and professional. I don't like to dress up so everytime I go to fancy places I get stereotyped service if you will. Not this place, both times I was treated nice. We had the seafood tower, ribeye, lamb chops, and buttercake. for the place they're striving to be I must say all expectations were met. Service, ambiance and food was top notch. 

If I had to say something negative...maybe the restrooms being upstairs. Lol after all the food I ate I don't wanna be going on stairs but they do have a elevator."}
{"text":"No question this is a popular Scottsdale spot.  At 6:30 on a recent Saturday night, it was popping!!  The place was packed and not with just wealthy Scottsdale retirees, either.  There was a good mix of families (my Gawd!  You'd have to be super rich to feed mom & dad and four kids here), middle-age folks, older couples, and a slew of the beautiful folks packed into the bar area.  Unfortunately, all those people produced a noise level that, despite acoustical dampening efforts like room divider drapes, carpets, table clothes, and upholstered chairs, made it extremely difficult to carry on a conversation across the table.  Plus, it is so dark in there the waiter passes out mini-flashlights so you can read the menu.

We all thought the food was well above average, although my grilled halibut was as dry a piece as I've ever had.  A little drier and it would have been inedible. I frequently order halibut at restaurants and when I can get a nice piece at the fishmongers, cook it at home.  None has ever been as dry as this piece was.  My wife had the ahi sashimi style and her dinner was excellent.  Another in our party had the sea bass which she loved, and two others had red meat and both thought their food was very good.

Our server was Cole and he was not only pleasant and friendly, he was very knowledgeable about the food and the wines.  He was one of the best servers we've had anywhere in recent years.  He nicely explained that their side plates are very large and we could either split one between two or more people or order half plates.  That was very nice and helped keep the bill down.  Plus, he comped our table a huge piece of their fabulous chocolate cake and their delicious  rum cake because one member of our party was celebrating a birthday.  How great was that?

My only real negative about this restaurant is the poor plate presentation.  The chopped wedge salad (think about that oxymoron for a minute) was just chopped romaine and other items on a small square plate.   It didn't look any better than what I make myself at home. There was also no blue cheese dressing that I could discern but it was so dark at the table it might have been on there, but I never tasted any dressing. .  When the entrees were brought to the table my piece of fish was sitting on a large plate all by its lonesome.  Nothing else adorned the plate!  No parsley, no decorative drizzle of sauce, no nothing.  The sea bass and the two steaks were the same way.  In fact, the piece of sea bass looked just like a large dinner roll sitting on a large plate.  All of the entrees were just plopped down on a plate with no attention to detail.  Gees, when I pay nearly 50 bucks for a hunk of fish you'd think the least they could do was make the plate look nice.  The only reason my wife's ahi looked the best was because it came on a bed of shredded carrots with a pile of shaved ginger.

I know this review won't have much impact on this place as they do a killer business, but for the amount of money we spent in there you'd think that they could take a little effort to spruce up the appearances of their food presentations.  We do eat with our eyes, after all!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm!  Best steakhouse in Las Vegas and there are a lot of them.  Everything was PERFECT at our meal.  Very pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"Dined here while in town for the SEMA show. Now I do have an Ocean Club by my house in Scottsdale which I love, however Las Vegas location took it a step further. I mean the food was excellent and very similar you must try the Chilean sea bass with the crust/ lobster mash/ & butter cake by the way, but the service we experienced in Las Vegas was out of this world! Everyone from the hostess to server and manager really made our experience wonderful. Keep up the good work I will be back."}
{"text":"Great for business dinner, round tables available.  Highly recommend the John Dorry fish, lobster roll, oysters, and Ahi Tuna.  Would have 5 stars but Swordfish overcooked.  Beautiful restaurant, packed bar.  Great drinks and wine list here."}
{"text":"The best food, service, and atmosphere of anyplace we've been! Our server was exceptional and even brought us butter cake on the house."}
{"text":"This is a very elegant restaurant. The food is incredible and the service is superb. 
For sure you should try the crab cakes and the signature cake is fantastic. 
The wine selection also is great. 
I guess everything is perfect in this place five stars for sure"}
{"text":"My husband took me here for our one-year wedding anniversary and I am hooked! I even asked him, \"how are we ever going to eat rib eye steak at home again?!\" 

5 star food. It's an unbelievable experience. Get the rib eye steak (it's 22 oz though so come huuuungry) and get the lobster mashed potatoes. The steak literally melts off your fork and into your mouth. The baked mac and cheese is also out of this world. I couldn't finish my plate because I had a skin tight outfit on and didn't want a belly, but next time I am coming in a big sweater and pigging out. 

5 star service. Our wait staff was exceptional. Every time they arrived to or left the table, they told us \"happy anniversary!\" and even brought out a chocolate cake to celebrate. 

I can't waaaaait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent meal. We made reservations at 7pm for a 9pm meal. Arrived at 8:20 and sat at the bar. 2 delicious pomegranate martinis. We were sat at 9am. Met an excellent server Johnny from Chicago. We was exceptional. Superb recommendations on meal and wine selection. Seared Ahi tuna, spinach salad, bone in filet and ribeye, lobster mashed and Brussel sprouts. Then to top it off at the end of the night, Butter Cake. We have made reservations for our return trip in December. We are impressed and you will be too."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just amazing. Came here for my birthday and the staff was really sweet. We started off with some bubbly and then wanted to do a shot so we asked the waiter to bring us a mixed shot. Our shot comes with pineapple juice and it was so warm as if the bartender didn't shake the cocktail. That was the only part of the night that was okay.

Other then that the food was amazing. Had lobster bisque and their chilean sea bass both were so beautiful and fresh. They even brought out their famous butter cake that said happy birthday!

Really cute location and a very romantic vibe there."}
{"text":"22 ounces ribeye steak was absolutely perfect and filet mignon was melting in the mouth. service was spotless and busboy was all around our table make sure to make our dinner an excellent experience. beautiful atmosphere in tree house make it even more memorable"}
{"text":"Forget about reservation, still waiting after 40 mins past my reserved time. Very rude hostess kept lying about our table will be ready soon, manager was nice enough to offer free drinks for waiting. 
Then after almost 1 hour of waiting we were finally seated, but now more waiting for our waiter to help us and after that 1 hour of waiting for food.  My friend ordered medium and the steak came out well done, again the manager offers free dessert for their mistake.  Our reservation was 7:30 and we were there until almost 11, the whole time I felt like one of my ex girlfriend (always bitching).  Horrible experience even with the free drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"This place is a tree house.. no really, it is!  Their main dining area is called the tree house; quite cute actually.  But regarding the experience:

Food:4 stars
Service: 1 star
Price:2 start
Average:2.5 star.. but I rounded up because my meal was courtesy of MGM... thanks casino host!

I was seated by the hostess.. then I waited.. and waited... and waited.. for menus.  After making continuous eye contact with the wait staff, displaying my need for service, I was ignored.  Then maybe after 10 mins, I received a menu, but still had to ask for water.  Shocking, as this is supposed to be a nicer restaurant.. You would think with these prices, would come service.  Also, during our dinner, I had numerous times where I was looking an empty champagne glass.. and no I'm not a fast drinker... If you are going to place the bottle in a ice bucket stand on the other side of the table, please be mindful of when to fill my glass... I know this may sound snobby, but i have no problem pouring my own glass.. however, I believe they should keep a close eye, especially since there was plenty of staff just standing around.

The mussels were probably one of the best I've had! This was a nice surprise, as most steamed mussels are quite standard with white wine, garlic and parsley.  But this had some sort of light and creamy sun-dried tomato sauce! it was thin enough to compliment these under the sea delights, but hearty enough to dip with bread!  The crab cake was also divine!  Definitely no fillers here.. instead, a cake-shaped form of literally pure crab!  The Chilean sea bass was prepared really great, especially for a white fish!

Overall, I would definitely check this place out, ESPECIALLY if you have a food/bev comp through MGM hotels.  However, I still prefer Sage over this place.  The service really stood out to me, and it was HORRIBLE!

Dear waitstaff.- please be kind to your customers, especially in the city of where splurge-worthy tips are common!  And to the tall, 60 year old server with some salt and pepper action going on ontop of that head.. stop winking at ladies.. you're creeping people out!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here and the dining experience was amazing!! My friend Daniel E used to be a waiter here but now is a manger and so I was sad I wouldn't see him but we had Dion and his service was remarkable!!! Casual and fluid yet professional and on point. The timing of all the dishes were excellent and I had a great time in the tree house!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  If you are looking for a good place to take your wife/girlfriend, this is the place.  Awesome food, awesome service, great ambiance.  I recommend the Scallops, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Chilean Sea Bass and the Butter Cake.  Also, like all Mastro's, they have an excellent wire selection.  The day after our visit, I got a call from the restaurant thanking me for my business.  Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas I had high expectations....and Mastro's exceeded my wildest expectations!   Wet aged beef is my new gold standard for prime beef!  The bone in rib eye was the BEST I have ever eaten, and the unique bone-in filet was very flavorful and very unique!   The mac-in-cheese was the ideal accompaniment to our meal and the house salad was the perfect prelude!

In Fort Worth & Dallas we regard Bob's Steak and CHop House as well as Del Frisco's as the \"go-to\" prime steak houses.......Mastro's has easily eclipsed both of these fine benchmarks."}
{"text":"Excellent service, lobster mash was delicious. Everything else was also........buttercake."}
{"text":"GREAT steak!
Had the bone-in ribeye... delicious. 
Minimal sides as the Vegas \"eating tour\" had me full, but definitely couldn't miss the dessert (chocolate cake, crumb cake and whipped cream). 
A must-do next time you are in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"AHHMAAYZING!!! The Butter Cake is to Die for!!! Love this place. I love their Escargot!  This is a Vegas Must!!  We never miss out on this place, everytime we're in town!!"}
{"text":"Awsome!!!! Food is excellent! I had bone marrow, steak and lobster mash potatoes. If there are two of you just get one side the portions are large. A must is the butter cake. Don't even think about any other desert get the butter cake and a cup of coffee you will need it. You will need to walk around because the meal is so good and rich. Great place and great staff."}
{"text":"Went with my brother for this Birthday. It's rather odd to be eating in this kind of restaurant in a mall, but the faint mall music didn't affect the food. 

We started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare then moved on to (rare) bone in rib-eye and Kansas City stip. My brother went surf and turf and added the prawn, which was basically the largest shrimp I've ever seen. We rounded out with sides of lobster mash potatoes and creamed spinach. 

My only complaint was my moscow mule, which didn't appear to have any ginger beer and was essentially vodka and lemon juice. Overall, the food was cooked perfectly and the service was attentive without being annoying (this is a fine line). It was a great experience and I'm sure it made my brother's day."}
{"text":"I have never been to a fancy steakhouse before, and I have learned that they are incredibly awesome!

We booked a reservation ahead of time, so getting seats were very convenient and we were seated right away. Our server for the evening was Craig and he was a very personable man, who was very helpful throughout the entire evening. He had an answer for any question I threw his way and he explained things that they were offering off the menu very well as well. 

Our appetizer came out first, which were their ahi tuna tostadas. They were very delicious. The tostada portion was very crunchy and had the perfect texture. The avocado and tuna that they served on the tostada were so soft and had a buttery texture, which was heaven in my mouth. Our entrees then came out with our sides. I ordered the bone in ribeye with an 8oz prawn, while by brother ordered the Kansas City strip. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. I ordered mine medium and my brother ordered medium-well, and it came out exactly as expected. For our sides, we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes along with creamed spinach. The lobster mashed potatoes were supposedly their most popular side, and I can see why. They had a good amount of lobster in that dish and it added a nice change to plain mashed potatoes. The creamed spinach was very creamy and rich. I personally could only handle so much, but they did prepare it very well. Since we went there for my birthday, they provided a complimentary slice of cake for me to eat, and it was a 5 layered chocolate cake. Their cake is some of the best cake I have ever had. I have no way to describe the taste besides \"clean.\" It stayed together very well, the flavor wasn't too strong, and the texture was perfect. 

To say the least, the service and food was some of the best I have ever had all in all. I definitely could not eat here on a regular basis, but for special occasions, this will definitely be on the list."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this a little bit more than the Beverly Hills location because of the view. Lobster mashed, creamed corn, steak and butter cake all for me"}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening! When I initially called to make the reservation I had a warm welcoming voice on the other end. 

Upon arriving I was a little unsure because I didn't realize it was inside the mall, I immediately didn't know what to expect. I have been to the one in Newport Beach, Scottsdale and Palm Springs, all fabulous of coarse. 

Hostess looked well groomed, acted professional and was very inviting and seemed happy to have us dine. 

Server Lionel was Amazing, Made great dinner suggestions. I had the Strawberry Mule to drink, Bone In Filet for dinner, My husband had the Lobster and we shared scallop potaoes and sauted asparagus. ( All sides are ala carte and are shareable for the table) 

Only downfall was there was a problem with the scallop potatoes, within seconds a manager by the name of Brandon was there, took it away and offered garlic mash potatoes in place , until new ones were ready. Nice recovery, and made the situation forgotten. When the new ones came it was PERFECT!

At the end of our meal our server Lionel and Manager Brandon came by again and apologized for the mishap and brought us a complimentary dessert which is there signature dessert, The Warm Butter Cake. All I can say is OMG!!! Best thing ever. 

It was a beautiful experience, Great food, service and atmosphere. Food was spaced out and timed perfectly. Excellent job chefs! I am defiantly going back next time we go to LV. 

A restaurant that runs this smoothly from back of the house to front is all from great leadership. Kudos to whoever is in charge, keep it up because your doing it right!

{"text":"My husband and I are huge mastro's fans! We have dined frequently at the Beverly Hills location and thought it would be a perfect date night on our last trip to Vegas to experience their Ocean Club. The location of this restaurant is in the crystals shopping center which is a little bit of a disappointment.  We dined in the tree house which was beautiful but the view of people shopping and the mall did take away from the ambiance, thus the four stars. I am a sweet wine type of girl and had the moscato, which was so smooth and sweet.   For an appetizer we ordered the scallops which were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. For our entree my husband ordered the chicken and I ordered the bone-in rib eye.  The Ocean club is the sea food version of their traditionally restaurant but offers many of their beef variations.  Most of the appetizers are seafood options but they offer their regular sides with additional seafood options. The mac n cheese and garlic mashed potatoes were great as always."}
{"text":"I have ate at Michelin Star Restaurants and very high end Steakhouses.  Mastro's Ocean Club is the best!  The ribeye plate was so hot that I could hear it sizzling.  I assumed it's just the plate.  The minute I put a piece of steak in my mouth OMG it's like heaven!  This is the way all steak should come out \"HOT\" like it was cooked and immediately bought out to your table.  I also have two seafood plates too.  It was also hot too! Most restaurant do not know how to get that part right. When you have multiple orders, and how to cook it where all the plates are delivered Hot.  The drinks are amazing.  The service is absolutely the best!  My must go place in Vegas from now on.  Just hope it will be consistent.  You got my Michelin 5 Star."}
{"text":"WOW is all I can say.  We have a Mastros Steakhouse in Chicago and I have not been able to get in as it's always so hoppin. So since we were in Vegas, we decided to give Mastros Ocean Club a try.  We were not disappointed.  The restaurant is located in the City Center shopping area and fits in well with the high end shopping and the swanky décor of the city center and surrounding hotels.  The décor is simple contemporary.  It would be too simple if it wasn't for their amazing bar set up but more their \"tree house\" structure.  If you visit Mastros, request that you sit in the tree house section.  They also have a lounge singer and piano player.  The volume was fine (as I've read other review that it was extremely loud) - but we were sitting in the tree house area so I can imagine if you had one of the tables next to the singer or in the booths behind them, it would be pretty loud.  Regardless, the singer was very good and sang songs from all genres.  Now to the important part - the food.  Everything we ordered was amazing.  As all higher end restaurants, all sides are ala cart but big enough to share.  Our entrees were delishous - ahi tuna, sea bass, and scallops.  I have no complaints, all were cooked PERFECTLY and extremely flavorful.  The portions were quite large.  The sides were equally amazing and big enough to share between 3-4 people.  One of the sides - the mac and cheese was AH. MAZ. ING.  If we're ever back I'd be happy to dive into the Lobster mashed potatoes.  The wedge salad was enourmous, enough to share between 2 people.  I had the lobster bisque which was very tasty.  I've had it before at other places and it sometimes has had a \"fishy\" taste but not this. And there were big chunks of lobster.  Service, supurb as expected.  The menu is pricey, but worth it.  I'll definitely be checking out Mastros in Chicago."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, fantastic food, cool venue.  Portion sizes great, wine list extensive, cocktail list large. Nothing negative to say about Mastro's.  Make a reservation and ask for a table overlooking the balcony of the bird's nest.  

We tried a little bit of everything.  To begin, the bread is fantastic.  baguette and pretzel rolls were the standouts, but I love a restaurant the begins with an assortment of complimentary.  The tuna tartare was heavy on the avocado, but surprisingly each bite mixed well with the tuna.  The mambo caesar salad was one of the best salads I've had with a kick of wasabi flavoring in the dressing to clear the sinuses.

For entrees, the table had the sea bass, tartare, lobster, steak, and big eye tuna.  We also shared sauteed spinach and the crab gnocchi.  Everything had a unique spice or rub that made sharing ideal.  The lobster was some of the thickest and freshest I've had.  The tuna was very good and had an Asian flare of black sesame seed rub, but this dish is also presented as an appetizer if you want a half portion.  The sea bass was fantastic fish but a little bland in all.  Steak - just a well-prepared steak nothing more nothing less.  The spinach was fine as a green but the gnocchi, with chunks of crab, was a nice accompaniment to the fish as its creaminess was a nice dipping alternative to change the flavor palette of the meal.

Finally, the butter cake.  Top 3 dessert of all time.  Don't know how they make it and don't wanna know.  I just want to enjoy it again and again . Fantastic.

All items come a la carte so be sure to feast on the sides.  Also inquire about half orders as this restaurant is surprisingly accommodating to changes to how the fish is cooked, changes to ingredients in orders, or sizing.  Mastro's is one of the best."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club is a fine dining establishment located in the Aria Hotel and Casino. The ambiance is set well, the architecture is particularly astounding, and the service is exquisite. Our server, Joe, was on his game. My water glass and wine glass never reached half empty (or half full). Ordered the Bone Marrow, Lobster Bisque, Ocean Club Crab Cakes, Sauteed Broccoli, Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese, 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, and Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake. 

Bone Marrow - Holy Donkey Punching Jesus this is astounding. I have never had Bone Marrow before but its alluring presence on the menu was enough for me to sample it. The Bone Marrow comes half charred on a split bone with a serving of toasted baguette to spread on. The flavor, the texture, the taste and everything about it was amazing. I will order this every time and you should as well.

Ocean Club Crab Cakes - Hearty crab cakes with more crab than cake. In fact the cakes fall apart to the softest touch, the chunks of crab meat separating with ease as only a minimal amount of filler has been used. Flavor and spice is more than enough to accent the cakes.

Lobster Bisque - Oftentimes Lobster Bisque comes heavily buttered, even in the most finest of dining establishment. Butter is an easy thing to add to a dish to increase its flavor without actually improving on its originality and substance. However, Mastro's Lobster Bisque does not perpetuate this and, rather, has a full-bodied bisque with a generous portion of lobster inside. The thickness is akin to how a bisque should be.

Sauteed Broccoli - Opting to go a slightly healthier route with one of the dishes I was still impressed but of course, it's sauteed broccoli, and only so much can be done while keeping it true.

Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese - a perfect compliment to my Bone-in Ribeye and a hearty side at that. It's a shame our hotel fridge has a monitored scale with a restocking fee otherwise I would have had no issue taking the remainder of this with me.

22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye - One of the finer Ribeyes I have had. A generous amount of fat and it was seared and salted well enough to make it exceedingly juicy. Cooked to perfection (rare) with a cool red center while the black crust of searing on iron was still present. 

Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake - Fuck. That's Amazing.

The servings sizes of sides are plentiful and the prices are what you'd expect at such an establishment. Be wary of those giving Mastro's a bad review due to price or service, such an establishment would be careful to hire only proven servers and I would wager that the reviewers themselves to be the standoffish party."}
{"text":"Delicious from beginning to end. The appetizers, the steak, the fish, the sides - all made to perfection. And the dessert, the warm butter cake, absolutely incredible. Too bad we were too full to finish it all. It's enough for 4 to 6 people, so leave some room for dessert. But don't leave without trying it. The service was wonderful too. Oh, I forgot to mention the bread! Fabulous. Just incredible all around."}
{"text":"So far, the best seafood restaurant we've been to in Phoenix.  Everything was excellent, from the menu, to the food quality and presentation, to the service.  Definitely a place to take someone to impress.  I've been there a half dozen times or so in the last couple of years, and never been dissappointed... okay, once, when I couldn't get a reservation when I wanted it.  If I didn't like trying new places, I would go back to this restaurant much more frequently."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, warm and romantic feel with live music...and great food! Delicious selection of fresh appetizers, entrees and the butter cake is stunning!"}
{"text":"The were some definite pros and cons at Mastros. 

The service was top notch, very impressed. Sat on the edge of the tree house area, prime spot. 

Had lemon drop martinis throughout the night, they are served with dry ice so it appears as tough there's smoke coming from the bottom. Very nice, cool experience!

Ordered bone marrow and 3 MASSIVE shrimp for an appetizer (served with dry ice as well). The bone marrow comes with bread, I had never had it before but since everyone raved I thought I would give it a try...it was very good but I don't know what the hype is all about, in general---it's just a delicacy? The shrimp were delicious but I was not a fan of the cocktail sauce...waaaay too strong for me. 

Ordered the lobster tail, not impressed at all. However, if you like a smoky taste on seafood, then by all means, order it. I was not a fan in the least, very disappointed. For sides I had the Gorgonzola mac & cheese and chic peas. Both are buttered to perfection, definitely worth the fat and calories. 

I also happened to go on my birthday so they surprised me with their Butter Cake (with ice cream and whipped cream) everyone couldn't stop talking about and OMG I completely understand why. I would have never chosen to order it but I can say, with confidence, that this is hands down one of the tastiest, most well made desserts I have ever eaten. You have not lived until you try it."}
{"text":"The food is here is unbelievably amazing. the service is awesome and very 5-star elite. the location is always busy, and I always recommend this place even if it is a franchise. it is one of those restaurants that you do remember for the taste of the food, more than the presentation. it is always a treat for me bringing my friends and families here, and truly--i never get tired. the crystal's location adds to the star, because i am happy it is located inside the crystals mall instead of a casino or stand alone.

Your must-tries:
 * any steak cuts
 * bone marrow
 * wild caught fish selections

They also will accommodate to your share-plates if you need it"}
{"text":"I'm shocked this place is averaging as high as it is. I ate there for the second time last night and the meal is best defined as overpriced mediocrity. The oysters were good, steak ok, desert a waste of calories.  I was there there the 1st time as part of a hosted corporate event and the food was bad. I hoped if eating at a table vs private room it would be better. Wrong!  Save your money and eat elsewhere... Preferably not in City Center though as all of those restaurants seem to be overrated."}
{"text":"One of the best seafood restaurants we've been to. Definitely a must go if you are in a city the serve. King Crab legs a must get. Dungeness crab cocktail that was all large chunks, nothing shredded. Lobster bisque was outstanding with actual pieces of lobster in it."}
{"text":"One of my favorites has now gone by the gutter.  Lack of attention to detail regarding reservation and celebrating a special occasion, lame excuse for credit system not handling chase visas and overall an unappetizing experience.   As a frequent customer to Mastro's I'm annoyed by the way management is handling us as consumers due to a fraud alert on our credit card.  Very impersonal, humiliating and overall disgusting.  We did enjoy the meal but don't feel I'll ever return to any Mastro's in the near or far future.  They even told us after trying to pay that chase visas have been an issue.  AFTER eating that is....BTW the credit was fine and all resolved but treated as lepers as we leave.  HORRIBLE"}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced! Food was bland and lacked any kind of flavor. Such a disappointment. Go somewhere else. This place is not worth it."}
{"text":"white table cloth, outstanding food, incredible service.  what else is there to say?  first time at a mastro's and boy was it an experience.  sides are served family style so be careful on how much you order.  i shared my lobster tail with my wife.  it was very good.  the bone in rib eye that she ordered was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Has 7:45 reservations, arrived at 7:30 and was sat promptly. Our server Dalin was great and made sure we had everything we wanted. The rack of lamb was excellent and the lobster mash was delicious. We started with the calimari which was lightly breaded and very juicy rings. Save room for the buttercake desert. Enough for 2 and tastes great with the fresh whipped cream they serve with it. Overall, great place to eat dinner for steak and seafood. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place. Now it has become to corporate.  Drinks are too measured especially when a martini is $18.  They bring out the whole jigger for an effect but it hardly fills the glass.  They claim it is 1.5 pours.  Ask the server to fill the glass and you will be disappointed.  All the portions have gotten smaller (ie salads).  I am ok with smaller portions but at these prices you have some expectations.  Dominic's, Prestons, Steak 44 are much better."}
{"text":"Eh. This place could have been better. The service was freaking SLOW, I was starting to get impatient.  What made this place great was the guy who played piano and sang live while we had dinner.  He was really good, my friends requested to sing 2 songs for us.

The bread were hard and our steaks were not that special, I've had better.  Really disappointed.

All in all, i expected better from this restaurant..."}
{"text":"We made reservations and were seated quickly and on time.  Service was ok, a bit slow.  While I don't mind paying alot for Great Meal this meal fell short.  The scallops were ok, not too much flavor, the Filet was so so salty it was unbelieveable.  The gnocchi side dish was ok, but for the cost was average at best. Afer our meal, this was where the service got just plain wierd it not bad.  We were full and waitress asked if we wanted coffee or any dessert. We said \"No Thank you check would be fine\".   We waited about 5 min and were brought plates, and then 10min. later we were brought a compliemntary dessert.  We have no idea what it was nor was it explained.  We then waited about 15 min. after  being served that unwanted dessert to say we were really done and wanted check, so they proceeded to then take unwanted dessert and have it wrapped up and another 5 min a check was finally brought to the table.  

 I was really expecting outstanding and this restaurant just fell short of flavor and service."}
{"text":"I feel like I have to post this review because this was an embarrassingly bad and expensive miss. I can't find a way to even justify three stars. I have visited Mastro's from Beverly Hills, Thousand Oaks, and Scottsdale. Not once was I treated so poorly and felt ashamed in front of guests. You take people here to impress them with top notch food and service this is why you pay top notch prices. There a few places that charge more and to be honest this is the only time it was so bad. Bland and boring food and exceptionally rude service that is not the norm. They were busy but not busting at the seams.

My wife ordered the lobster which was no better then you guessed it Red Lobster. She asked repeatedly for drawn butter after hers was spilled and did not get it until close to 20 mins after her lobster was served. Deplorable! My martini I ordered was watered down which is very out of character for this place. Our guests (our newly married daughter and son-in-law) decided to share a steak and shrimp cocktail. The steak was ordered med-rare but was served med+. Unforgivable. I will be going to Steak 44 who are actually the original family/owners of this chain and hoping to find some semblance of the place I have become accustomed to."}
{"text":"Believe the hype. This place is worth the hit on your bank account. 

They took 5-star dining to a whole new level via a phone call the next day to see how our experience was the night before. Some patrons might not like this unsolicited call, but I didn't mind the show of courtesy. 

Must haves: bone-in ribeye, truffle crab gnocchi, and brussel sprouts. 

Further proof they're all about customer service: they automatically split our entree in half for us (no split fee). Also, we were apprehensive about ordering the full order of the truffle gnocchi, so our server offered to give us a half portion (for exactly half the price: $16). This was NOT on the menu, and the half order is more than enough for 2 people (I can't imagine how huge the full order must be). If just two of you, I highly recommend you ask for the half portion and order something else. 

So, here's a PERFECT meal at this Mastros for 2 people at ~$100 (no alcohol)-

1. Bone-in Ribeye 22oz ($59)
2. Half order of the Truffle Gnocchi ($16)
3. Brussel Sprouts ($11), or whatever other side dish you prefer

That's A LOT of food for 2 people. Trust me. And everything's mindblowing. 

Lastly, can another unoriginal idiot please post another unoriginal picture of the restaurant's structure? There aren't enough of them on yelp. Thanks."}

Parents in Scottsdale for a first look at the new house / neighborhood. We were on the horns of a dilemma : ? Would a mid week , early season dinner at the club be too quiet? Should we  descend south of  the Frank Loyd Wright  into south - north Scottsdale....??

We opted for the safe bet - booked a car and headed south to the Ocean Club.

Now - I don't like Sake ( see note above) - but on occasion - I like to fancy myself as the kind of guy who may indeed like Sake- hence , I order a Grey Goose Sake Martini -

\" I have no Sake\" the waiter announces sadly.
Now - this is tricky - can I in good conscience penalize the establishment for not having a beverage that I really don't like or want in the first place?

Too bad for you Ocean Club 'cause yes I can.

The drinks arrive - I have opted for Grey Goose sans Sake

The waiter then arrives to review the menu and describe the specials-
This he does without note , blackboard , evening card or inked cheat note on his wrist-

He recites for what seems to be forever...
It is like a reading from the old testament - but instead of a mere chapter of the book of Leviticus - he recites the entire book....
I am captivated ....( or is it the Grey Goose)

?? does he really know the name of the Italian girl who dug this evenings truffles up in Piedmont...??

?? does he really know the glove size of the Japanese ranch worker who massaged the Wagyu beef and from which prefecture he hailed...??
( if so - why didn't he have him send me some Sake....??)

at any rate - I am entertained

{"text":"In my sincerest opinion this place was created for the sole satisfaction of consuming only the finest grade of beef. I have been to Steak 44, Durant's, Ruth's Chris, The Keg, Lawry's, listed as ranked in my opinion. The place that keeps me coming back for the special celebration is Mastro's. The environment, service and quality are a cut above. Whether you are in the mood for a seafood tower, an amazing salad, or a scrumptious melts in your mouth steak. This is your place......trust me! This place oozes good looking people and money. The other steakhouse are not even a close second, they are filled with high class escorts and Porsche driving men that have something to prove to themselves. Oh, I almost forgot about the freshly baked bread is a slice of heaven."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends and the food was just ok. The service was ok and the price was high. I must say I thought the decor was nice and cozy, considering its in the center of the busy mall."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, fabulous food & superb service. The steaks were perfect & the lemon drop martinis were the best we've ever had. Staff were attentive. Ask for Brandon Manoff to be your food server. Knowledgable & professional, he made it a memorable meal."}
{"text":"Delicious food and attentive service. Expect your dining experience to last a little longer and it can get fairly loud as well. My filet was perfectly cooked, mushrooms were delicious. I did not partake in the dessert, but the butter cake looked divine."}
{"text":"Mastro's was recommended by a co-worker who went to one of the locations in CA and absolutely loved it. I made reservations for a group of friends and I, and despite some initial resistance from my fellow Yelper Lauren M., we all had a fabulous time and were more than happy with our decision to come here!

Our server, Lionel, was amazing the whole evening. He was friendly, helpful, and attentive. He recommended we get a customized seafood tower, and everyone in the group was very impressed.

We were also impressed with our meals. I got the bone-in filet, and two of my friends split the tomahawk special. My other friends got fish. My filet melted in my mouth and was cooked perfectly. I don't typically get filet when I go to a steakhouse, but I was so happy with my meal! 

We also got the very popular lobster mashed potatoes for a side, and it was delicious. Lionel brought us out some of the warm butter cake for dessert, and it was amazing! You could definitely smell the butter as soon as he put it down on the table. You must try it if you come to Mastro's!

The setting is a little weird, as you are essentially in the middle of a mall. Honestly, the food was so good that I could have been sitting literally anywhere and enjoyed this meal!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the service, absolutely exceptional!! We were greeted and welcomed by several staff members just entering the restaurant and walking to our table. Our waiter was awesome and very attentive. Now to the food. I ordered a rib eye and asked for it medium well (which has a little pink inside.) It came well done and I didn't have the heart to complain since it was a $59 steak and sending it back would mean they would have to make a whole new one. It was also pretty flavorless. Boyfriend ordered lobster tail and in his exact words \"best lobster tail I've ever had.\" I'm glad he felt that way since the rest was just ok. Our scalloped potatoes were very salty, but the creamed corn was pretty good. It was $200 for just the two of us."}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant while on business. The Filet was outstanding, but the Butter Cake was even better! This is definitely a nice place to return to."}
{"text":"We went to Mastro's for my friend's birthday dinner.  We were all impressed with the staff - they were very friendly and accommodating (we were 30 minutes late for our reservation).  Our waiter was attentive and made sure we all had our drinks and that the food was to our liking.  Speaking of the food, we loved EVERYTHING!  A few of us ordered steaks (that were cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth!!)  Some ordered fish and they raved about their dishes.  We shared a variety of sides including asparagus (steamed and sauteed), lobster mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, and king crab gnocchi (which was out of this world!!!!!)   

Bottom line, it's definitely worth a visit.  We will be going back next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ho
Lee
Cow!

The food is diverse and amazing - but lets face it, you come here for the SERVICE!  This place is a classy establishment that caters to the upper crust of Scottsdale.  The food is pricey, but the total package is worth the expense.  Very Impressive!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! This was practically the highlight of my trip to Vegas . They give you a variety of bread but their bread didn't really impress me . The oysters were alright but didn't really impress me either . I had the bone-in filet mignon which was absolutely heavenly !! It was so yummy and literally melted in my mouth !! Their filet mignon is perfect ... the best I ever had !! The cream of corn made the perfect side . It was very delicious . They also carry white muscat wine which was good . It came out to be about $100 per person with the muscat wine including tip but it was totally worth it . I will definitely be back here again the next time I am in Vegas !"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for our anniversary and had a wonderful experience. We were happy with the service as well as the food. We were seated in the tree house as requested.  We started with the steamed mussles and bread basket. mussels were good however quite small. Bread was aldo good no complaints. I had the 18oz bone-in filet, Oscar style something I've always wanted to try.  The amount of crab meat was generous and the bernaisse sauce was good. Worth the extra $25.  My wife got the pan seared Chilean Sea Bass and it did not dissapoint. As for sides we ordered half orders of the lobster mash, green beans and the mushrooms. The amount of food was way too much for the two of us. The lobster mash was good but not worth the $18. We could've gone without it. Better off using that money to get your steak Oscar style. Much more satisfying.  Staff was professional and attentive. Drinks were really good ad well. For dessert we got a complimentary butter cake which very good but we were to stuffed at that point to really enjoy it. 

I took one star away because I had my steak packed to-go for a midnight snack and when I open the box I find that there was only one piece of crab. I know I had at least 4-5 pieces left. I really wouldn't have been able to eat it all but it's the principle.

Anyway I would visit Mastro's again but order less."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing spot I've probably been here 5 times. The food had always been good every time and the staff is just so nice and friendly it's definitely a spot you don't wanna miss. The restaurant is so uniquely built and fun the price is not bad either."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 1 star because at least the service was good, but the food was horrible. First we got the escargot as an appetizer. Parts of the escargot was cold and tasted like dirt. It was obviously frozen and not cleaned well. Just to let you know this is not our first time eating escargot, it's one of our favorite dishes, so we've had it plenty of times. As for the entrees we got the swordfish, which was extremely dry and tasteless. We also got the seabass, which was over cooked and the filet steak which was over chard. It was very disgusting! Very disappointed in the food.  How can we tell our server that all of the food that came out was disgusting. We didn't want to make a scene so we just ate what we could, paid and left. Our first and last time ever going there. The price that you pay for the food, it was definitely not worth it. We've had 100 times better. Mastro definitely topped the list for the worst expensive restaurant in Vegas. Definitely will not be returning. Great service but horrible food. Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"The best seafood I have ever had. Better than Italy. Better than Greece. And I am from Seattle! The best. The ambiance of the place is top notch as well as the Kierland Commons in Scottsdale. It's is an oasis in the physical and cultural desert that is the Phoenix metropolitan area."}
{"text":"Came here 4th time, I didn't realized first two times, but third was very impressive so I came back again and was same experience.

Food? yes it was very good. 
Service? amaging! best service I ever experience in same class of restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was bomb. Especially the shrimp and scalloped potatoes. However this review is for Stephen who was amazing. Excellent server."}
{"text":"Met a friend for dinner on a weeknight.  We had some trouble getting a table in the bar area.  I asked the hostess for tips so things would be easy the next time.  Fortunately, a waitress found us a nice table in the bar.  I ordered a margarita with and shrimp cocktail.  The entertainment was lively with some people dancing."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the night seems to end with a good story to tell! We always sit in the bar area, order some wine and sometimes a salad (LOVE the Spicy Mambo Salad) and make up stories about the people around us. 

To say I enjoy the people watching here is an understatement :)  The servers are great and sometimes give us clues about the other patrons. Everyone around us seems to be having fun and the place just has a good vibe.  It's a friendly crowd too, we always seem to strike up a conversation with someone and make a new acquaintance.  It's pretty dressy and I enjoy getting dressed to the nines once in a while, and this place is worth it.  Don't miss the pretzel bread - yum!"}
{"text":"This was everything I had hoped and more, amazing seafood cocktail tower appetizer, the best steak I've had in a year, and the Mac and Cheese was melt in your mouth delicious! Would go back anytime, amazing service too!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I tried this place out yesterday for our anniversary dinner. I feel like usually when I leave a review its because I'm unhappy with the place but that's NOT at all how we felt last night at Mastro's.. Down to every detail the experience and the night was amazing. Our server Paul gave us the best costumer service we had ever experienced. He was friendly.. Made jokes and even custom tailored our menus to our liking.

I started off with a cocktail that Paul personally had made for me based off my preference for something sweet and tropical, yet strong. My fiancé had a beer found only at Mastro's. For appetizer we both had shared the shrimp cocktail. The shrimps were jumbo sized and so fresh it's as if they had just got it from the ocean! 

For our entrees my fiancé had the rib eye and I had the 3lbs Maine lobster. Our server brought out the food and de shelled the lobster in front of me. He even cut up my steak in front of me. Talk about excellent service! The food was so flavorful.. fresh and the service was impeccable! I definitely would recommend this place.. And ask for Paul to be your server!"}
{"text":"Shady rolled in to Mastro's to commence his epic 8 night assault on Vegas on a sunday evening 8.30. Housed in the Crystals Mall(one word of caution-if u come to Crystals with a special someone plan on dropping a few k$-its 5th ave on steriods). Seated in the neat tree house, Shady and Co. started with some seared Ahi tuna, well presented and delicious. Shady and lucky guest split the bone in ribeye and the crusted Halibut special and side of roasted sprouts. The steak and brussel sprouts were spot on. The Halibut was a touch disappointing, undercooked in spots and with no real oomph in the flavor. The dessert had to be the signature warm butter cake. Big enough for 8, Shady and friend got 1/3 through and called it quits. The creme fraiche was outstanding and the cake as good as advertised. But why so huge? Service was very good, and the vibe very enjoyable. Shady always have reservations ordering fish in Las Vegas, and next time will stick with what Shady thinks is their forte-the meats. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is more of an event than as meal. They have good live entertainment and the patrons at the bar are worth watching. Very good drinks that include a nice selection of wine to a martini with dry ice so it bubbles. The best thing about the filet was the nicely charred crust and that it was on a 400 degree plate so that every bite was as good as the first. The baked potato was good not great. Duke is a great server who can help you enjoy your time there. The only reason I didn't give it 5 star is because i have had better Good less money."}
{"text":"Great food. Great staff. Dessert was amazing. Outstanding atmosphere. Ordering one side is more than enough for two people."}
{"text":"I had the following items:

Petit Filet
Scalopped Potatoes
Butter Cake

Everything was very good - all items were perfectly seasoned and I really felt satisfied with such a flavorful meal.  Ending the meal with the Butter Cake is the best choice you can make - it is so decadent and satisfying!

Great service and attention to detail here...it's a pricey spot, but worth the splurge."}
{"text":"You will over order. It's all just too good. Great service - wonderful food. Enjoyed my hubbies 50th birthday here!"}
{"text":"We ordered steak, lobster mashed potatoes, Rosemary mushrooms and a lobster bisque.. everything was amazing and cooked just as we ordered except the lobster bisque it was waaaaay too salty for my taste. On top of the bisque its self being salty it came with a piece of Parmesan bread which made it even more salty and did nothing to even out the taste. I ordered this as my dinner because I wanted something light since I had eaten a late lunch. It was disappointing."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had in Vegas in a long time. Located in Crystals shopping center in Aria, great views from the restaurant if your seated in the right place. Decided to try this restaurant for my husband's bday after a friend's recommendation. I ordered the sea bass and my husband ordered the 20 oz rib eye! The BEST steak and sea bass we've ever had at any restaurant in Vegas.  The waiter was excellent! He knew we were sharing and decided to split both items for us ahead of time. He made an excellent recommendation on how the sea bass should be prepared (blackened) and plated our sides when our food came so we barely lifted finger :P And since they knew we were celebrating my husband's birthday he got a free chocolate birthday cake :) Will definitely be coming back here again! Excellent food, excellent service!"}
{"text":"I don't know what else I can add to these reviews. I love steak. Mastro's has the best steak I have ever put in my mouth. Hands down. The seafood was also amazing. I was there during restaurant week and got the three course - chowder, strip, and butter cake. I'll save room for more steak next time, but the cake was delicious (not really a sweet tooth kind of person). I was amazed at the quality and freshness of the seafood - we got the tower with dungeoness and snow crab, prawns, and oysters ($200). 

Everything was totally worth it. The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"We came here based on 2 recommendations from good friends. My goodness, we sure are happy we did. We came here for dinner last night to celebrate our one year anniversary. We made reservations a week prior to visiting Mastro's, which apparently was a wise thing to do. We were sat within 5 minutes of our arrival. The server greeted us and informed us of the daily specials. We ordered the calamari (yuummm) and a mojito (don't order it, you won't miss out on much, tastes like Sprite with a hint of mint). The drink however, will not affect the way I will review our main course and service. My husband and I both ordered a filet for dinner with a side of scalloped potatoes and asparagus.... The asparagus was fresh and cooked to perfection. The potatoes were packed with flavor. You won't be disappointed with the potatoes. Lastly, the steak.... WOW. The steak was cooked to order and very delicious. We enjoyed our dinner at Mastro's aaaaand were very thankful and appreciative of the complimentary warm butter cake dessert that was given to us to help us celebrate our anniversary. 

The excellent food, attentive and friendly staff, establishment design and atmosphere make for a enjoyable dinner experience. I definitely recommend this place. It's pricey, but worth it... I say live a little and treat yourself to a nice Mastro's dinner, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Food is verrry good. Service ok. Had to chase our server around but to be fair it was busy. Lemon drop martinis to die for here. Sauteed shrimp and house salad=perfection."}
{"text":"I had to make sure i made a visit to the Mastros in City Center this past weekend. Ive been to vegas 2 times since this location has opened and havent found time to make it over, so it was a must. 

Arrived and was greeted kindly as always. Was seated within 5 minutes of our reservation and they sat me in the Treehouse with a booth as requested. 

I really enjoyed dining in the treehouse area. It didnt provide the same, dark, old school lounge feel that the Costa Mesa provides, but I enjoyed it anyways. 

The service was excellent as always. Out server, Brandon i believe, was very attentive, professional and personable. 

The food was as good as ever. Started off with the ahi appetizer. Followed that up with the wedge salad, which is one of my favorites. Then the 12oz filet with brussel sprouts and mushrooms. And then finished off the night with buttercake. Lets just say i slept well that night. 

Mastros has yet to let me down."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the service and the food. We ordered a few appetizers - calamari...excellent, salad, and I had salmon. The mac and cheese is amazing. They also had great live music. It was worth every penny - the best food and service I have ever had. 

Also - our server Mike - awesome! :)"}
{"text":"My friend & I started with a bottle of Marquis de la Tour non-vintage Champagne. We ordered the Mastro's Signature Seafood Tower of shrimps, lobster, Alaskan King crab legs, Alaskan Red King crab claws, and Kusshi oysters. The shrimps were plump & juicy, as was the lobster. The crab was sweet & succulent. The oyster were very fresh. On the side were cocktail sauce, mustard, and our favourite, atomic horseradish, where a little goes a long way! In addition to the seafood tower, we had the Alaskan King crab black truffle gnocchi. As it approached our table, the smell of the black truffles was very evident. Atop the gnocchi was a parmesan & bread crumb topping, which was baked until golden brown. We added a few lemon drop martinis, which were pour table side. It steamed as the liquid touched the ice. 

The service was amazing. The waiter was super friendly, and the water boys were attentive. I never saw the bottom of my glass. The ambiance was very delightful. It just made the meal even better. We loved every element of this meal!"}
{"text":"We had my daughter wedding reception here it was absolutely beautiful and top notch. 
Staff was attentive, from wait staff, bathroom attendants, and the bartenders. Each staff member was professional. Exceptional politeness, courteous beyond anything I have ever experience. 
I had the Filet it just melted in your mouth- food outstanding. Reception Room gorgeous view of the mall, great lay out.     I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant -next time in Las Vegas I will make this a dinner stop for sure.     Thanks for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Frazier took good care of us for the evening.  The atmosphere was lively and fun.  The live music was a nice addition to the restaurant. I really liked that the ambiance wasn't as dark as other steakhouses. The lobster mash potatoes were to die for. The fish, crab cakes and steak were all great selections too. An incredible place to dine with family and friends. We will definitely be back to visit."}
{"text":"I was here this week with a group for dinner in one of the private dining rooms.  First off, the service was excellent the entire evening.

Seafood tower with shrimp and crab was perfect.

Lobster bisque was tasty, nice and creamy and had a large piece of lobster at the bottom of the bowl.

The chilean sea bass was cooked perfectly.  Could of used a little more spice or seasonings on it to make it really pop.

Overall, a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I  had a reservation for 3 people on Saturday, right away we were seated by a friendly receptionist, Our waiters name was Paul he knew about everything on  the menu, I highly recommended that you ask  for  him he is  very attentive. I wasn't to sure of  what to order and he helped me choose from drinks to dessert!  Aside from great customer service the food was delicious and perfectly cooked! There's a lot of restaurant's in Las Vegas but very few like  Mastro's it us a must try! and  don't forget to try the warm buttercream cake!"}
{"text":"The most amazing seafood I've ever had other than what I've had in Hawaii and parts of California. Blueberry Martini - to die for. Crab cakes - a must. Butter cake - heavenly. If you have a party if at least four or more - splurge and get the seafood tower! Service is just what you'd expect from this restaurant chain - five star all the way. All seafood is flown in fresh every day. I miss being able to eat here!"}
{"text":"A pricey restaurant, but definitely worth every penny!!!!!!
Best Chilean Sea Bass I've ever had!! 
We started the meal with a lobster bisque which was delicious but rich so it was good to share. They have a unique bread basket which includes a delicious pretzel bread. The cocktails were nicely handcrafted and good to start or finish the meal with. I recommend the blueberry martini :) 
Not only was everything we ordered prepared perfectly the service was also on point. Everyone was friendly and more than willing to make sure we had an excellent dining experience. 
I highly recommend this restaurant just know it is expensive but the quality of the food and service are worth paying for :) :)"}
{"text":"WHAT is the big deal? Okay, I've given Ocean Club multiple chances. This place thinks it's a big deal and for some reason there's a cult following of people who don't know any better? It has never impressed. It's too crowded. I think they must have hired an engineer specifically to determine how to cram the maximum number of tables in the restaurant. The server kept bumping into my chair to get to the table next to me (I was pulled ALL the way forward and am not a large person). The team service is annoying. AND the biggest issue, psst... the food is not that good! I think people think they should be impressed and forget to expect the actual thing."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I made a reservation two hours in advance using Open Table. Arrived 10 minutes early and was seated immediately. Servers were very nice and professional. If you have someone in your party celebrating a birthday, tell your server and they'll give them a beautiful slice of chocolate cake on a pretty plate and fresh whipped cream. Enough to share with 3-4 people. 

Crab lovers get the Dungeness Crab Cocktail! It's amazing!! The Clear Lobster Roll and calamari is really good as well."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly disappointed with the food. I ordered the salmon, and it was too dry. My cousin ordered steak medium done, but instead it was rare. It also took a really long time to get the food. For sides we ordered corn which was my favorite. Bristle sprouts, mushrooms, and green beans. All which were really good, but not enough to say I would go back again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The discount on this review is based on the hostess service upon check in. 

I wanted to have dinner with my dad for his 73rd birthday. I made a reservation for 5pm for a party of two. I showed up early at 4:20pm and hostess said she could not seat us however we can sit by the bar and have drinks and appetizers. The two hostesses asked for my name multiple times for the reservation. We sat by the bar and the bartender says only non cooked items are available for appetizers. I wish the hostess mentioned this before offering the bar side option. 5pm passes by and I see the hostess seating other parties to the tables. I went back to the reception and the same hostess asked for my name twice. She points at another host and I assume to follow her. She doesn't acknowledge or provide a greeting. I realize she is the one supposed to seat is. Maybe the host station wasn't organized or wasn't ready for the evening but I didn't appreciate the confusion and cold reception upon check in. I understand names are complicated but I must have said my generic name seven times to two different people, \"Cheryl Garcia\". To add additional confusion, I received an email saying I did a 'no show' for my reservation on Open Table. I'm not certain how that happened even when I checked in on Yelp as well. 

The server provided better service and made excellent recommendations. I have an issue with over ordering but that's because I want to taste everything. For a party of two, I ended up ordering the chowder, calamari, sides of roasted brussels sprouts, sauted asparagus, twice baked potato, sea salt & vinegar fries, and twelve oz bone in filet. The bread service was warm with an assorted selection. I enjoyed all the sides except the twice baked potato- I thought it was too salty & the chowder was slightly watered down and boring. The calamari was flavorful and crispy. The bone in filet was served sizzling on a ceramic platter and was super tender cooked to perfection. 

The server brought out a complimentary butter cake for my Dad's birthday. The cake was warm and rich topped with a vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries. This was very special and made the overall experience much better."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! I'm so full I may need to be rolled back to my hotel... We were told to share food so we did, thank God. We started with a bottle of Chateu St Michell Chardonnay. We had a wedge salad and I'm pretty sure I've never tasted tomatoes like that before, they were so flavorful. Then split a New York Strip steak, delish, cooked perfectly, I could only eat 1/4. Paired it with a twice baked potato that could have been a meal of it's own. To finish it off we had their famous warm butter cake, holy cow! It's like nothing you have ever tasted before, it's a must!!!"}
{"text":"Had our wedding anniversary dinner here. Altogether, I was satisfied. The place was creative--eating in a fancy tree house! The food was decent but you're really just paying for the ambiance. We ordered the scallops, lobster mashed potatoes, clam chowder, and two fish entrees (mine was the special from New Zealand and forgot what hubs ordered). I thought the lobster mash was good but way too buttery. The rest of our meal was okay. We couldn't order dessert because we had to leave but the server was kind enough to give us a complimentary anniversary chocolate cake. He was a great server btw...wish I remembered his name!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and this has been my favorite place in lv.  Wheels came off last night, bad food, poor service, so dissapointing.  Ordered bone in filet, medium.  Cut into it and it was purple, np big deal sent it back.  Steak came out later, now red, waiter sort of argued with me about it which was unusual as mastros usually has great service, sent it back again.  Now of course it comes out well done.  Manager comes by, listens to me takes it off bill and comps dessert.  Nice but still poor dinner at a place i have always considered bullet proof.  People i ate with liked their food, but it was not a good experience for me."}
{"text":"Our group of 12 had dinner at Maestro's and it was fantastic.  Jamie and her team provided us with excellent customer service and the food was exceptional.  Don't miss this one."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now. I can't say I love and I wont say it sucks. There is just a lack of something that takes me from 4 to 3 stars. Service was outstanding both times. Very attentive waiters, but not annoying. The food is good, it's just not great. I haven't been wow'd either time. I enjoyed my meal, yes, but wasn't super crazy. Maybe its' the price point and I dont feel I'm truly getting my moneys worth. I had the ribeye the first time and the sole the second time. I've had the calamari appetizer (PASS on this, not good), the mussels (pretty good both times), I also had the wedge salad which I always enjoy. Again, food is good, I'm not complaining, it's just not great. Drinks are good but like the food, on the priceyer end."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Mastro's before, but this was our first experience at the LV location. Since we only wanted dessert, we hadn't made a reservation. The staff kindly seated us at a table in the bar area that is really nice, too. Our waitress was super helpful, friendly and our wonderful dessert showed up right away.

I can't recommend this location enough. It seemed a bit more quiet that other LV restaurant locations which you often can't hear your dining partner who is seated right next to you.

No matter what, save room for butter cake!!!"}
{"text":"We went in January for dinner as my husband received a gift card. Yes, this place is pricey, but well worth it. The service is phenomenal. They even have bathroom attendants! 

My husband got the bone-in filet and I got the king crab legs. He ordered the wedge salad and I had the chopped salad. We had the sugar snap peas and scalloped potatoes as sides. Even though he asked for the filet as medium, it came medium rare. He didn't mind. I had a bite and while it was very tender, I would have sent it back for more cooking. My king crab legs were fantastic. Perfectly cooked - not too salty or too watery. The sugar snap peas were crisp and the scalloped potatoes were very rich. 

Our server was spot on until we finished our meal. She was being attentive to a large table, but we were ignored for a good 10-15 minutes once our entree dishes were cleared. This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. 

I think this is a great place to go for a special occasion dinner. We're not the only ones who think that because the restaurant was packed in early January."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with any of the Mastro family of restaurants. Ocean Club is always our go-to for celebratory dinners, but it doesn't come cheap. Expect to spend about $200 for a couple depending on what your order. I would definitely suggest the Chilean sea bass, lobster mashed potatoes, and warm butter cake. Also, the pomegranate martini is deadly. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable service!!!! Our food was not right. Everyone including the manager was trying to help. I have never seen such an incredible staff. This place is amazing!!  The level of service was impeccable! Recommend it to everyone!!"}
{"text":"Seems like I've been on a steak kick recently, which makes me realize that my stomach and wallet are inversely proportional. After visiting Gordon Ramsay and Old Homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. Mastros, of course, had the same effect.

Our party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:

A dozen oysters (Kusshi and Bluepoint). All were delicious but, personally, I prefer the smaller Kusshi.

The ahi tuna tartare was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors.
 
Ocean Club crab cake. There was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.

The scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. The accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.

The 22 oz bone-in ribeye, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. A solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.

Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi. A little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. Pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.

Alaskan king crab legs. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. Each yielded plenty of tender meat.

That was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. It was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. It came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. I was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. The flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. As delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.

Mastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the Strip. The atmosphere isn't the greatest either. It is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. There's no dim, mood lighting. Just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. The tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. We sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.

There was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. I had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like Aubrey O'Day. I didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.

I'm not sure how this Mastros compares to the ones in California that people rave about, but relative to Vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. It's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake."}
{"text":"This review is a little late, but I had a different experience compared to all the other yelpers. 

We came in for Thanksgiving Dinner, luckily we got a table right a way. The hostess was very sweet. The ambiance of the restaurant was great, and it's located right inside the mall. 

Service was great from our waiter and he was very attentive and helpful. My only issue was that when our server was busy and we tried to call someone over but even though other waiters were around and saw our flag down we were totally ignored. 

Our food came timely, the spinach and scallop was delish! My only issue was that there was a hair in my lobster mash. I let the waiter know and he kindly took the mash away and asked to replace it. The replacement was delicious but I was already turned off with that hair. 
That's why I took one star away. I felt that if I'm paying $300+ for a thanksgiving meal, it should come with high quality food, good service at all times, and that doesn't include hair in my food. I requested my steak to be medium well but it was definitely very rare. The meat was under cooked for my taste, and they were nice to recook it but it just took two times for them to make it right. & I'm reallly not a picky eater. It just sucks that the time they spent recooking in sitting there watching my party enjoy their meals. 

All in all, I was dying to try this restaurant and had high hopes for it.. but I would not come back because of the high price tag and the service/food was not worth the $$"}
{"text":"I was on a trip to Vegas on a shopping trip with my mother and my husband demanded that we went to this restaurant.  My mom loved that the restaurant was in a tree-house. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We both had the petite fillet, cook amazingly to both our liking. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes (amazing as well). unfortunately, we didn't have room for desert, but it a reason to go back! I even got a phone call the next day asking about my experience which makes me feel valued."}
{"text":"Great food, great service just a little pricey for a date night. I would suggest this as a great place for a customer dinner. Plenty of food options that would satisfy anyone's needs. The sides were great too and large enough to share. I recommend the sea bass with sautéed mushrooms and the creamed corn."}
{"text":"Well I can't say this area doesn't have good seafood anymore, however, my pocket cannot afford this place on the regular.

Fabulous seafood, extremely fresh."}
{"text":"Lobster mashed potatoes, seafood tower, bone-in filet, 5 star service, presentation, be sure to get a spot in the \"treehouse\" section. Take a good look at menu prices beforehand though;)"}
{"text":"Scene here echoes forties + version of the 90210 set. Good looking old and new people. Bar scene was a riot for people watching.
Food and service are very solid. Server doesn't even blink to recommend the lobster mash potatoes ($33) or the alaskan crab truffled gnocchi.
Oddly enough everyone ordered their prime steaks in our party and they were good- served a la carte, broiled at extremely high heat to the point that it  actually burned my mouth to eat my ribeye at a perfect med rare.
Giving a star off due to Fleming putting out a better broiled bone in ribeye, 
but overall a really good and interesting dining experience.
Make sure to get a after dinner beverage in their bar and watch how things unravel."}
{"text":"This pace by far was amazing!  Was only here for dessert, but oh what dessert and service.  Had the butter cake with a side of their whip cream and ice cream it it was a MUST have while at Aria!  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back for more !   Also tried the cheesecake which was very good , but back to the butter cake!  Accompanied by an espresso martini which just made Dessert that much more memorable.  This place gets busy so get their early or come in late for a nice generous and delicious portion that is sure to satisfy your sweat tooth! Great way to end a night!"}
{"text":"Prettiest bar ever. 100 bottles of each brand lined up. Waitress made a teeny mistake with our oyster order."}
{"text":"The Tuna Tartar appetizer was just brilliant.  It couldn't have been better in my opinion.  The service was top notch.  Great location for hosting clients!"}
{"text":"Seafood tower, lobster mash, butter cake - love this place.  It's like all the other Mastro's except the menu has the fish at the top and the steak below so no need to feel guilty about ordering steak at a seafood place.   

The layout is a bit crappy with the bench.  I actually got seated at a table where the bench splits.  Fortunately an empty table solved that problem.  

Service is always good, the portions are a nice size, and the atmosphere is great.

Yelp coupon for free butter cake and cosmo - sweet."}
{"text":"Ocean Club used to be my go-to spot for girls night out and dates with out-of-town visitors... Sure, it's expensive, but I've never had a bad meal (or drink) there.  But, I took an unintentional hiatus from Ocean Club when I got married and had a baby, and what do you know, at least two years have passed... 

So when it was time to choose a restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday dinner this past Saturday, Ocean Club it was, and once again, I was reminded how fabulous it is!  While I used to sit in the bar (where there is great people watching including plenty of \"hired help,\" awesome bartenders, and live music), we had the baby with us and a party of five, so we were seated in a back corner... this was totally fine by the way.  They had a highchair for the baby and everything!  

Tyler was our waiter and he was great... the rest of the staff was extremely attentive as well.  My husband, mom, and I went with dirty martinis, and my dad and brother went the bloody mary route.  We were all pleased with the drinks - as mentioned in other reviews, they are indeed pricey, but you get two drinks in one!

Bread bowl - this is worth mentioning as they always have a nice selection of breads and crackers including my favorite: pretzel bread... yum!

Appetizers at our table included two types of oysters, a lobster sushi roll, salads, and calamari.  Hint: ask to split their salads - they are still a decent size when split.  I love their \"Ocean Club House salad\" - It could possibly be a meal in itself as it has crisp lettuce, fresh shrimp, egg, blue cheese, tomato, and onion.  The other apps were delicious too.

For my entree, I split the Chilean Sea Bass with my husband... I'm a huge sea bass fan and this is up with there with some of the best I've had.  Again, splitting it is great as even a half serving is plenty once you add family style sides, etc...  My parents went with lobster tail and brother had a bone-in ribeye.  We chose the roasted brussel sprouts and signature lobster mashed potatoes (both cooked perfectly and oh so delicious as well).  Note that it's very difficult to choose just a few sides as there are so many to choose from and they are all delicious.  The sweet potato fries, onion rings, creamed spinach, and steamed broccoli are other faves that I've had in the past.  

As if any of us weren't full enough, Tyler brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake for the birthday girl, served with fresh whipped cream.  Mmmmm.... and once we licked that plate clean, we also ordered their signature butter cake, which came with more fresh whipped cream.  OMG - that butter cake is incredible!

We all went home full and happy and will definitely return for more special occasions.  Thanks to my dad for picking up the bill!"}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the best meals I've ever had.  A great location, an amazing experience, and possibly the best waitstaff I've ever encountered.  Everything was perfect and I could not have enjoyed my time at Mastro's more."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Very expensive, but on a special occasion, it was a perfect place. My ribeye was one of the best steaks I've ever had, as was the twice baked potato. My wife had the Alaskan king crab legs, and it was literally 3 giant legs, already half shelled. Amazing. Good dessert, great selection of scotch and fancy drinks and presentations for plates. The ambiance was great too. You could tell it was all fancy. Service was good. Definitely don't come if you are in a rush. We were there for over 2 hours, but we never felt like we were waiting. It was a \"good\" 2 hours. Unless you're super rich and you know it, I'd hold off wearing jeans and tennis shoes. This place is too fancy for normal attire. Slacks and a nice shirt or polo would do fine."}
{"text":"I've been to the mastros and Costa Mesa, but this one in Vegas probably has better customer service.

The food quality is the same, and tastes the same. They offer most of the same food items but for some reason Vegas is a little cheaper. 

For the appetizer I got the lobster bisque and the mastros Cobb salad? I suggest ordering the salad as a half size the portion was huge even split between two people. The lobster bisque was soooooo good! I didn't want to share, but I did. I'd definitely pick that over the salad any day. 
We ordered a bottle of red wine...forgot the name but it was pretty reasonable for $45. 
For the main course I got the bone in ribeye, snap peas, mashed potatoes, sautéed mushrooms. All were really good! I was super full from drinking and our appitizers we had to make most of it back to our hotel. But the leftovers were still amazing as a late night snack. 
I suggest sitting in the \"tree house\" it seems a little more intimate than in the other section.
Lastly thy brought us out the better cake and oh my gosh! They did not have this option at the Costa Mesa one. This seriously was so good!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Beverly HIlls location and it is my favorite steak joint. The service was awesome here but the food was very disappointing. Portions were way smaller and the quality was not the same. Very disappointing when I was hyping it up to my family. I will not be back."}
{"text":"First time here. We had a private dining room for large group. Dinner overall was great. Seafood towers ordered & very fresh. Ordered swordfish but it was a bit salty and was not able to eat it all (didn't care to send it back, it was very tender though) Lobster mash & other vegetable side dishes were good, didn't care for the lobster mac n cheese.  My husbands steak was good, others ordered the salmon which looked delicious, will order the salmon or steak next time around. I've never had ahi tuna which was also ordered by some in the group & they were very happy with their choice (it did look good). . The waiters hustled, but at the end of our meal I requested a coffee & never got it while others did. We managed to get dessert the warm butter cake. Yum!!!  It just felt like they were overwhelmed.  I'd rather come to visit just the hubby & I for our 2nd visit."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend Mastro's Ocean Club.  We had a wonderful experience in the tree house.  We started with an apple martini and a berry martini.  The apple martini comes out smoking, we also saw a Cosmo come out the same way.  A really cool touch!  We order an appetizer of shrimp cocktail, it come with three but since there were two of us Lionel ( our server) suggested we get four, so we did.  They were huge and very tastie.  The cocktail sauce was delicious along with some very hot horseradish, perfect balance.  We also ordered ahi tuna as an appetizer, this was amazing too.  Ordered salmon prepared blackened style and my husband order tuna Asian style with a side of asparagus.  We ordered way to much food as the portions are very generous.  We then had raspberries sorbet, which was to die for.   So, I mentioned large portions..we took home tuna, salmon and asparagus to our hotel room and ate a wonderful lunch in the room the next day.  They also boxed up the bread, which is a variety of sourdough, pretzel roll and something like a baguette.  Our lunch was just as good as our dinner.  I mentioned Lionel earlier in my post.  Well, you must request him as your server, he is personable and very professional at the same time.  Be sure to sit in the tree house.  It is expensive, but well worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"My husband has been spoiling me rotten for the last days of my 30s. We had the pleasure of coming here Monday night. We were greeted my the beautiful Jasmine who told me she had the same exact birthday as me ( only she was 1993 and I was 1973) but we were so giddy about it. Once we were seated our server Allen was one of the most attentive servers I've ever had. He was so polite and knowledgable, he knew every detail about the menu and made sure the food was to our liking. I got the lobster bisque, and the scallops. My husband got the fresh oysters, and seared tuna. Everything was perfect! Then they came with my chocolate cake with fresh cream. I cried, it was magical! I hope I don't have to wait another ten years to come back. What an experience!"}
{"text":"Ocean Club is expensive, flashy and some say a \"must-do\" in Scottsdale. We found it expensive & flashy but a \"MUST DON'T!\"   Try someplace else your money is too precious to waste here.  Everything from wine to food was wrong but all served with a smile. We started with oysters Rockefeller. This old school dish should be warm, bathed lightly in spinach and cheese & above all succulent.  These were flat out over cooked. The  oysters were rubbery and the cheese was bone dry & crispy. All-in-all the major components were flavorless. The predominate flavor was bacon. Hence, we never eat \"Bacons Rockefeller\" again. The salads were unevenly dressed so that the top was tasty & the bottom swimming in globules of dressing. As for the main courses, my wife's lemon sole was ok but my Artic char was over done and mealy. Moreover, the restaurant seems to be afraid of their products so they default to butter or bacon for flavor in all the dishes we had. Finally, the wine service failed. My wife asked if their Chenin Blanc was dry \"oh yes,\" replied the server.  Wrong - it was sweeter version of this Loire varietal fortunately they switched easily.  Then with our bottle of wine it took 3 tries to get it right and they failed there. They first presented the wrong vintage (not the one represented in the wine list); then they tried to offer a bottle $100 more than requested. They and we settled on wine from a different vineyard and vintage. They at first wanted to charge us $60 more for the bottle to match what I asked for, but adjusted when I pointed out the discrepancy.  Again don't go"}
{"text":"Biggest shrimp I've ever had in a shrimp cocktail. Smoked salmon, perfect! & the duck horn red was mui deliciso!"}
{"text":"The name Mastro's is known to a lot of people for their steaks already.  We happened to be in Vegas for our anniversary, so we decided to have dinner there as our celebration.

Because this place is located at the City Center right in the middle of the mall, so it doesn't carry the same kind of \"exclusiveness\" as the one in Costa Mesa or B Hill.  Dress code is also easier, only required hotel casual, so shorts and tees are welcome.

Just as mentioned by most, the staff are extremely polite and friendly, that was a great start already.  We got seated fairly quickly and our waiter brought us the wine / cocktail list quickly.  I asked for the Mastro's Mojito cocktail, which is rum with lime and mint.  It's not very strong and I like it a lot.

We were aware of the portion at Mastro's, and since my wife is pregnant she can't eat too much.  So I asked the waiter if it's OK for us to split the steak and allow us to try more other dishes.  They were very understanding and said absolutely no problem at all.

For appetizer, we went ahead and ordered the sauteed scallops.  We were both very very impressed with the dish.  Three gigantic scallops, all prepared and seared to perfection, and the sauce was awesome together with the bread.  It was very rich and good.

We also ordered the lobster bisque, and they went ahead and split the soup between two bowls for us, that was very nice.  The waiter also came and helped us split the scallop appetizer on our dish, that's great service.  We also tried the pretzel bread together with the soup, they all paired together very well!!!!!!

My wife particularly loved the lobster bisque.  She commented that a lot of times the lobster bisque she has is way too salty, but the one we had was just right.  Very smooth and rich in lobster flavor, but it doesn't get overpowered by the saltiness.

For steak, we ordered the bone-in 18oz filet and we asked them to split a small portion for my wife (medium well).  Mine was cooked medium rare.  It was simply fabulous.  Meat was very tender and juicy, and even my wife's portion, though cooked medium well, was still very tender.  

And I have to say one of the most important thing they did right was resting the steak well before serving.  Most of the time when I eat steak, by the end it was juice all over the dish.  But not this time, all the juice was retained inside, that was awesome.

We also got the lobster mashed potato as side dish.  It's good, a lot of lobster as stated by others, though I agree with my wife, while it's good, for $36 bucks, it's basically lobster mixed with mashed potato.  It doesn't have that \"specialness\" in some sense.

Since it was our anniversary, they gave us a big chocolate cake.  It was BIG, and it tasted really good too!

At the end of the day, we were impressed with the dinner.  It's not cheap by any means, but for special occasions, the quality and quantity of food?  I think it's worth it.  Although part of me still wonder how the experience would differ if we were to go to the one at Costa Mesa."}
{"text":"I didn't believe it when I heard the Ribeye was hard to finish.

From my experience, fine dining is hard to get full. This was not the case here. I was warned about the size of the steak and from the menu it was 22oz! That's ridiculous! Even if the bone was about 5oz, that's still a whopping 17oz!

All the servers here are exceptionally knowledgeable and professional. I felt like I was not treated as a kid eating at the adults' table. 

We all shared a portion of the lobster mashed potatoes and by far they are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. I would highly recommend trying this dish.

For my main entree, I ordered the 22oz Ribeye cooked medium rare. Although next time I would probably get rare+, I thought the medium rare was still delicious. The steak was massive and amazingly flavored. By the end of the meal I felt overwhelmed and defeated. I have never been conquered by how much steak there was until Mastro's.

My brain kept telling me to eat more but my stomach fought against this decision.

Overall, Mastro's was a great experience. The steak here, so far, is only second to the Kobe beef I had in Japan. I would definitely come back for seconds."}
{"text":"Ocean Club is a great place to impress a date. The atmosphere is great, service is fantastic and the food is good. The atmosphere and service surpasses the food. 
They serve a great basked of bread. But they can skip everything but the pretzel bread. I am totally addicted to Ocean Club's  pretzel bread. I always order more and they bring another basket which the waiter delivers without a roll of the eyes . The butter is soft - can't stand it when the butter comes out a cold little ice cube. Here it is soft and ready to spread. We started with the Seafood Tower. We picked crab, lobster and a few others.  That was where we could have stopped and been full but didn't. 

I had the lemon sole. Okay I was not that impressed. It was  a bit dry and not much flavor. That was disappointing but since I was full already - not a big deal. My guy got the Chilean Sea Bass and loved it. Of course we had the lobster potatoes which is a rich and large dish that could be a dinner for two. Then we topped it off with their signature Butter Cake and chocolate cake. Both were great. But portions are big so you really only need one dessert (and more romantic to split a dessert!). 

The service is the best thing about Ocean Club. The wait staff is attentive but don't interrupt you every 15 seconds. They seem to just know when something is needed or wanted. 

If you want to impress your date, get seating inside the restaurant area. If you want to do people watching and the noise doesn't bother you, the bar area is the place to be."}
{"text":"A mall restaurant by any other name is a mall restaurant.  Beautiful mall by the way. This restaurant is very very very expensive.  My personal recommendation is don't order rack of lamb well done.  It comes out inedible as punishment for liking well done.  I have made and ate well done rack of lamb all over the world. Never has a restaurant cooked it in such a way that a knife could not cut it AT ALL.  Service was great though. My husbands steak just ok.  Butter cake was wonderful though.  We would not return.  Much much better restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had an amazing time ringing in 2014 at Ocean Club.  We made dinner reservations at 9 intending to hang out the rest of the night.  Table was ready right away, server was awesome and the food didn't disappoint!  We all ordered a surf-n-turf steak and lobster combo and shared the lobster mashed potatoes.  The warm butter cake is a MUST order! Yum!

Great way to ring in the new year and we are considering going back next year!"}
{"text":"BF and I stopped in while enjoying an impromptu mini vacation in Arizona.   There is something wonderful about deliberately leaving your Southern Calif. coastal community in late August and going to Scottsdale Arizona during her off season.  Everything is open and everything is available.   And Mastro's never disappoints. 

The service levels are so superior that the food pales in comparison.   Every moment is attended to with grace and professional courtesy.  

Dinner was a \"made to order\" surf and turf split between the two of us.  They even split the steak and cook ours to order, his rare and mine medium.   The lobster was sweet and moist.  The creamed corn and creamed spinach beyond compare.  Everything was done with our intent in mind.   

Only small flaw was the Creme Brulee.  Our server highly recommended the butter cake and I think we should have listened.   It seemed as though the Brulee was made earlier in the day and sat in the refrigerator.   The caramelized sugar was too cold to have been made to order. 

The wine list was a little more limited than my expectations but was quickly relieved with a reserve list upon order. 

And a phone call the following day to thank us for visiting. 

It get's no better than this. 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"Ocean Club has been one of my favorite restaurants since moving to the area 3 years ago.  I ate there again two weeks ago and was reminded of how much I love it - and why.  The food is amazing.  Ah.ma.zing.  And yes, you can get amazing food at many places, but the service is really what sets it apart.  There are few places that I actually enjoy paying this much for dinner, but here I'd gladly pay more.

Must have's:  seafood tower, lobster mashed potatoes, butter cake"}
{"text":"I live in Orange County and have always wanted to try Mastro's steakhouse but have never had the chance. A short trip to Vegas and we needed a place to dine- so Mastro's Ocean Club was the choice for the evening! When we made reservations, we asked to be seated in the treehouse- what a cool ambience! Bread basket was super yummy but pace yourself- don't want to fill up before that delicioussteak gets to your table! Orders at the table included: Mastro's salad, filet mignon, shoestring french fries, baked potato, side of mushrooms, and the sauteed asparagus. All were delicious! All 3 of us had the filet and it was perfectly cooked and DELICIOUS. Can't wait to go back! We were so full but had to have dessert so ordered the butter cake and we were not disappointed. I'm not a huge fan of cake but this was one of the best desserts I have ever had. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a friend who is a regular.... went with my sister for her birthday.  Now you know the place is great when its part of a basket / bird nest sculpture...

On a serious note, the food was out of this world. I had the bone-in filet mignon, medium - one of the best filets I've EVER had...and I've had a lot of filets.  I can't remember all the sides I had, but they all were great as well. The sides are served \"family style\" so you can share with one or two people at a time.
Service was at part overall. The hostesses were very accommodating with reservations (might be because it was a Monday). We did have to flag down our server once or twice...and usually I ding a restaurant for having to do that...but the food was so great this place gets a pass.
Oh, and I think we were the youngest patrons the entire time. Could've been a fluke...again, was a Monday night.  

Definitely would come again!"}
{"text":"Place was amazing! How can you go wrong with Mastros! The only difference here is that their is a lot more seafood on the menu. Great service, great environment, come early and have a drink at the awesome bar/lounge/piano lounge. Seafood tower was amazing, butter cake was amazing as usual, service was not as good as Chicago but it was still good for Arizona. Place was packed with a lot of older people, and football players that I had no idea what team they played for. Great date spot, or even just for a fancy cocktail or glass of wine. We have a great time, my
Boyfriend loves Mastros"}
{"text":"Went to this Mastro's last year while visiting the area for a meeting, and as expected, had a great experience. I have been to the ones in Vegas and Laguna beach a few times, and the food, drinks and service have been consistently great at all locations. This Mastro's has one of the most lively scenes, and it was packed to the gills. The crabcake, and the swordfish were excellent. I really like their cocktail menu, and wine list, which are fairly similar to the other locations. While crowded and a bit loud, it was a fun place to go, and will definitely go back next time I get to the area."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes! Took some friends and clients for a beautiful dinner here. What can i say? Amazing food. Highest quality I've had in a VERY long time. The steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and all topped off with their truffle butter (highly recommended but an extra $15 add-on, I know. I can buy a lot of butter for $15, but worth it). Yum! Also ordered a fairly large seafood tower. It was stocked with lobster, large crab claws, oysters, crab legs. Can you say, Unbelievable! With our steaks, we ordered the following sides. Creamed spinach, mac and cheese, and the gnocci. All amazing. Obviously the price here is fairly hefty but was well worth it. Impeccable service with our waiter anticipating our every need. We ordered so much food that they ultimately comped us on a free desert. Way to go Maestros. Will most definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Definitely must do spot if you're celebrating a special occasion.  Pricey? Yes, but you're worth it!  
Hubby took me for my x0th bday. 

First order of the night were drinks and appetizer. I ordered a lemon drop and surprised that the whole shaker remained on the table. I had probably 3-4 glass servings. There was dry ice in my martini glass so the fog effect was a nice treat!  For appetizer, we shared the crab cake which was just enough for us two. They brought out the bread (different types) and ALL freshly baked!  We also shared a Caesar salad per recommendation of our server cuz it was a good size. Not your average Caesar - you can tell is was all from scratch down to the anchovies.  For the main course, I ordered a 6oz filet and hubby ordered 12oz. Both perfect as expected. For the sides, we had the lobster mash potatoes (OMG!) and sautéed asparagus. All of it was scrumptious. Finally, they brought me my bday cake - butter cake topped with vanilla ice cream and a side of housemate whipped cream.  It was yummy and rich, But truly, this could be shared by six people, I barely scratched the surface. 

Great atmosphere, great servers, awesome food!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed to write this review.  We had such high expectations of Mastro's having been to their other locations.  Celebrating our wedding anniversary and completely giddy, we sat down, ordered cocktails and dove into the incredible bread basket.  Our waiter seemed annoyed with us from the start, but no big deal, we ignored it.  I ordered chicken (please spare me the \"you don't order chicken at a seafood place\" lecture...I ordered it because it was on the menu, so let's get through that, k? Lol).  Our waiter was non-existent all evening, so he wasn't around at all for me to tell him that the chicken was glaringly under-cooked.  The manager happened to see us looking around and took it back to the kitchen.  He brought the same re-cooked piece back, but one spot (it was a really thick piece) still didn't look ok.  We had the flash light out and kinda debated if it was cooked enough, but the chance of eating slightly under-cooked chicken and getting sick was not an appealing option to me.  (And should I be having this debate at such a fine restaurant?).  I decided not to chance it, but not say anything.  The manager saw me not eating (our waiter was still in abandonment mode), took it away and insisted on replacing it with a filet.  The filet came out and was delicious and we were happy, albeit the mood had changed.  We felt like we had done something wrong.  Honestly, our least favorite meal of the whole weekend.  No butter cake, no second drinks--happy anniversary to us.  :(

Thank you to the manager for not charging us for my chicken or filet and really trying to fix it, but I'm so sad we spent our anniversary there."}
{"text":"My husband & I went to Ocean Club on Saturday to celebrate my new job (yay!). If only we could afford to celebrate more at such an elaborate restaurant!

I love a good bread basket & this one did not disappoint. We started with oysters which were fabulous (you get 6). For my entree I ordered the sea bass & Ryan ordered the scallops as well as a side of garlic mashed potatoes. The portions were more than generous & everything was cooked perfectly. It was so much food that we didn't have room for dessert, so the warm butter cake will have to wait til next time.

Between the topnotch service & fabulous food, you have to expect a hefty bill. We'll probably only be so lucky to go once in a blue moon, so it was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I Love to try new restaurants whenever I visit Vegas.  Our party had a craving for High Quality Steaks and we luckily found Mastro's though Yelp.

We scheduled a reservation last minute and they were able to find a table for us.  Food and drinks here was delicious and the service was great! 

The next day I noticed a discrepancy with the charges on my credit card.  I called and spoke to the manager.  He was very attentive and responded to my concern in a very timely manner.  The experience here was wonderful.

If you're in the mood for a luxurious dining experience in LV, definitely try Mastro's Ocean Club!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Mastros for the first time after hearing such amazing things about the place. Boyfriend made reservations here for our 8 year anniversary on a Saturday evening, requesting to sit inside the \"treehouse\" that everyone on yelp recommended. They even called him the day before to confirm if we were still coming. 

We arrived about 5 minutes early and the host immediately had an \"oh crap\" look once we gave her the name for our reservation. She said if we wanted to sit in the treehouse it would be a 45 minute wait.. I was so upset because we made reservations almost a month in advance and the fact that they called us the day before to make sure we were still coming... Whatever

We didn't want to wait the extra 45 minutes cause we were starving, so they sat us at a different table. 

We ordered cocktails, which were really good and strong! We got crab legs as appetizer and they were really fresh, I liked the cocktail sauce that came with it. We decided to share the bone in filet because we didn't want leftovers because the hotel we stayed at had no fridge, they were kind enough to split this for us. We also ordered scalloped potatoes as a side. The steak was okay, a little too salty for my liking. The potatoes were still hard, I wish we got Mac and cheese instead. Even though we split the steak we still couldn't finish it, we ended up taking it togo along with the potatoes. 

For dessert we got the infamous butter cake and it was delicious! They put and candle and wrote happy anniversary, which was really sweet of them. When the check came I noticed that they charged us for the anniversary cake, I was reading other reviews that people got their dessert comped?! Anyways, overall I'm not sure if I'll return, at least not this location. I'm still bitter that they couldn't accommodate our seating arrangement for our anniversary."}
{"text":"Oooh, we fancy!

The boy and I got all dolled up for after-dinner drinks. It was around midnight (where the night just begins on the Vegas strip), and the place was beginning to clear out (big win for us).

He ordered a Manhattan (as a real man does) and I wanted something spicy, so I got a Bloody Mary. 

His drink: strong, bold, tasty--just like him!
My drink: spicy, salty, and filled with every vegetable you can imagine--just like... me? 

Seriously, though, the Bloody Mary was excellent; it was one of those that burned your throat; being the masochist that I am, I quite enjoyed it. I was also able to snack on the olives and giant celery stick that accompanied it. A drink AND a meal--what more could you possibly want?

It wasn't cheap, but then again, we didn't expect it to be--a snazzy joint like that."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Very rude hostess (Asian young lady with dyed blond hair working on the evening of 09/26/15). No eye contact when we arrived, no eye contact as we were speaking to her. We understood that there were extremely busy during the time and we had to wait, but interaction with the first person you encounter makes a big difference in your whole experience. The first encounter ruined our whole dining experience. We made the mistake of staying because we were so hungry even though we had to wait an extra half hour even with reservations. We were hoping the service after the first encounter would be better but the whole experience just felt rushed. The food was so so. The one star is for the Chilean Sea Bass which was excellent but the rest you can find at other similar restaurants. For the price you spend at a restaurant such as this, we expected better customer service at the very least.  Would not recommend as there are much better coptions in Vegas with similar menus, much better service, and much better ambiance (not in a mall)."}
{"text":"We dined at Mastro's at the suggestion of my client.  It's an interesting location in the Crystal shopping center right off the strip.  The food was very good as was the service.  But it's spendy!  $18 glass of Glenlivet 12, $14 for Soli and Tonic.  And a word of advise, don't open the wine menu if you are faint of heart.  With that said, if you just crushed it at the tables and you got some money to spend - have fun!"}
{"text":"Mastro's is definitely one of the best places for a nice night out or for a celebration dinner in Scottsdale. The food is always good, and the service is great as well. The only downside is that even when you make reservations, I've previously had to wait up to 30 minutes for our table to be ready. I've enjoyed Ocean Club several times, but on 5/11/18, though the food was still good, it did not live up to the expectations I had from previous times eating there. Pictured are everything I ate/tried, the clear lobster roll, seared scallops, truffle crab gnocchi, truffle butter wild mushrooms, and the butter cake. The sauce under the sushi was amazing and spicy, and no complaints on the butter cake! However the scallops could have been seared more, and the mushrooms were so drenched in the butter that they became soggy (if you want mushrooms from here I prefer the roasted button mushrooms they are to die for!!). Overall it was still a good dining experience and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I have to say, the staff was absolutely fabulous! We came to mastro's at the last minute after having a terrible experience elsewhere. We had to salvage our anniversary dinner somehow and mastro's was able to squeeze us in on a busy vegas night. Not only did they listen to our story(which is another review entirely) but made up for it tenfold. 

Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and helped us select the perfect dinner choices. I must say the gnocchi w snow crab and truffles was exceptional, literally the best I have ever tasted. We also ordered a pair of lobster tails that were also excellent. To our surprise they comped us their signature desert w a happy anniversary message written in chocolate across the plate. Everything we tasted was outstanding.

Again I have to thank the staff for a truly memorable experience. Every person from the busboys to the manager were very professional and treated us like regulars. I would give Mastro's my highest recommendation and encourage anyone to give them a try."}
{"text":"Everything here is absolutely amazing. I had the ribeye and it the best I've ever had. The truffle mushrooms are to die for and the Mac n cheese forget it. Our drinks were wonderful and the service was impeccable. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The service here is amazing - probably the best I've experienced.  The attention to detail was ridiculous.  All of the wait staff was very friendly and attentive and worked together seamlessly to make our experience as pleasant as possible.

They had a moderate sized wine list with a good selection of reasonably priced bottles as well as several by the glass options.  No complaints there.

For our entree, I ordered the bone in ribeye and my wife got a filet.  This was probably my first experience at a high end restaurant where the steaks were wet aged.  My impression was unfortunately mixed.  The steaks were definitely supremely tender but they lacked that meaty punch that good dry aged steaks usually have.  Overall they tasted like a really tender version of a supermarket steak - not bad but definitely below expectations.

We got the warm butter cake for dessert which was very good.  It's big enough for 2-3 people to share though you won't want to share it.

Anyway, aside from the somewhat disappointing steaks, this was an amazing meal and experience.  We'll certainly be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Everything from the bread basket to my appetizer to my steak to dessert to service was outstanding at Mastro's!!  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  Okay, if I had to pick one thing... I would say if you're looking for a \"romantic\" dinner date setting, I would probably say this is NOT the place.  It's in the middle of a mall.  But, romance is what you create so to me, if the food is good and service is great, that's really what counts!  Our server was awesome.  He made great recommendations, was attentive, was kind, was not annoying in the sense that he was trying to recommend only the most expensive things.  He was honest about what was good and not just based on price.  The steaks were cooked to perfection and they are huge!!!  You can seriously share a steak.  Like really.  The sides were amazing and also huge.  I mean seriously... Truffle Gnocchi!?!?  Holy hell!  And Lobster Mash?!!!  Yes please!  And you need to save room for the butter cake. You just have to.  It was so good.  I mean like really good.  I don't know what else to say, it really was that good!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food delicious. However, the location wasn't my favorite since the restaurant is located inside the Crystal's LV shopping center and it has an open view which you can see all the shops. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing service and fantastic food. Well worth the price tag! Servings were more than generous. I recommend the Crab Oscar!"}
{"text":"Had our late Valentine's dinner here tonight, and this place is phenomenal! My family and I love to try different restaurants, and out of the many restaurants we've been to, living her in Vegas for the past 20 years, Mastro's is by far the best we've been to! Capital Grill, Gallaghers, Sonoma Cellar, Hank's, and the list goes on, but nothing beats the food and service we've experienced tonight. The staff there were very attentive, someone always there to make sure everything was as we liked it. The food, I must say was exquisite! The ribeye steak was cooked to perfection, soft and flavorful. The salmon filet was flaky and juicy..the lobster mashed potato is a must! And to end it all, as full as we were..we just had to get the butter cake, which I can say was heaven! Very good experience, and we will definitely be back! Thank you Mastro's for an unbeleivable night!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business meeting and my boss told me to try their martinis. 
I am not, what-so-ever, a martini drinker but, I cannot rave enough about their Dragonberry martini.

Off the bat, I was thrown off by the jalapeno in the drink but, I think that's what made the drink different, special, and delicious for me.
It had that extra kick with alllllll that alcohol."}
{"text":"My dessert and drink experience was definitely worth five stars, but I can't give five stars without tasting the dinner menu. The butter cake dessert filled with cream cheese is out of this world. Three of us shared it.

The Fountain of Youth is the drink to get--if you're considering that or the Raspberry Flirtini. 

Service was amazing. Prices are high. Drinks are around $17 each."}
{"text":"For what you pay, I expected much more on all fronts. First off, we had to get our entrees to go because we were going to be late for a show (not the fastest restaurant) and they forgot to include mine...so so sad :(  Too late to return to get it though. Otherwise I was just generally unimpressed. We were put in the darkest corner with no lights so the ambience was a little off to me. All the food was just blah, not bad, but not what you expect for the price. Fried calamari had too little seasoning for me. Seared ahi tuna was pretty tasty I will say, but there was like 4 thin pieces not much to eat. Spicy mambo salad was basically like ceasar salad. Seafood tower was decent and included raw oysters, lobster, crab...the basics. I was going to take pictures, actually I tried, but as I said place was nightime dark in there. Anyways, I'd take my money elsewhere personally. But again, I didn't have my dinner so..."}
{"text":"Dan is an amazing manager. He accommodated a different table for us to our liking after our reservation. I have been her a million times, or so it feels like, and each time it the menu and staff improve. The oysters were amazing. It is definitely worth asking what the catch of the day is. We had Fanny Bays, which are a bigger more meaty oyster, the blue points and the kumomotos were spectacular. 

We ordered the scallops- to die for. However everything is great here. From the bone-in-ribeye to the swordfish. We started out this evening with the crab cakes, which were phenomenal. 

Our wine choice was point on, Dan did direct us in the right direction. We shared Justin by the bottle , along with speaking pelligrino. We did have two glasses of an amazing red blend as well at the bar. 

I have never been unhappy with Ocean Club. It is the best of the best!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner on August 9 as a treat while we were in Vegas. We were not disappointed. It was an overall great dining experience. The atmosphere was excellent. The food was good to great. My wife's steak was a tad over cooked, but my steak \"Oscar style\" was awesome! The sides were generous and delicious (lobster bisque, gargonzola Mac & cheese, king crab gnocchi). And the butter cake for dessert...wow! The service was impeccable from our waitress Tanya to the support staff. Tanya was informative, attentive, and most of all friendly. If we make it back there, we will request her table for sure because we were very impressed. So, even though it is pricey, I highly recommend Mastro's. Cheers."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food! Wish i could eat here more often. Best appetizers and everything is cooked perfectly. And the butter cake is wow"}
{"text":"Couldn't stop eating...steak, calamari, scallops, lobster mashed potatoes, spinach, butter cake!!  Impeccable service, nice views of crystals, and awesome leftovers:)"}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! is all that I can say!  I am a huge fan of Mastro's and have been to most of them in the Los Angeles area but I have to say this is the most unique one I've ever seen. Located in the shops at Crystals which in itself is a gorgeous mall, this beautiful wood structure houses The Ocean Club Mastro's in Las Vegas. And as usual the food is always amazing here. My go to favorites have always been the bone in ribeye, the cream corn and the always delicious pretzel bread. And to top it off the always delicious butter cake.... the best dessert I've ever had in my life! I have tried to go to other steakhouses but I always come back to Mastros...hands down the best steakhouse in the country...."}
{"text":"Omg great cocktails food excellent and The service the best this place is top notch valet parking also must go too they also have a live band/dj area by the bar surrounded by glass so you can't hear it in the dining area"}
{"text":"The halibut was great! It did have a white wine butter sauce but the scallops were to die for. 
Definitely a great spot to come back to!"}
{"text":"The bread was great, and the cocktails were amazing, but that was the extent of it.  I got the scallops, and they were a bit overcooked and really greasy, and they were served on a limp, super greasy piece of what I think was supposed to be garlic bread.  Not sure.  We also got the gnocchi, which was great.  A little rich, but I think that was intentional.  Friends got fish and a sushi roll, both alright, but I expected a lot more out of a place that was charging so much.  Definitely can get better quality, especially in Vegas."}
{"text":"A beautiful fusion of woods, forward leaning design, sushi & seafood selections and warm service make this a great large party dining experience."}
{"text":"Go to Mastros City Hall (Drinkwater) for a better steak, but you can get decent seafood here and great atmosphere with a bar scene."}
{"text":"Incredible food and even more amazing service! Number one experience this trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Maestros Ocean Club for dinner with clients. Its actually in the mall upstairs in the back so took a little while to find it. Good wine list, excellent service and the seafood tower was a hit with clients. Overall very solid dinner"}
{"text":"Went for a romantic dinner on our anniversary. Bad table, but we moved into a high top in the bar and it was perfect. Now one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"It was delicious!  Excellent service and a great wine selection. The oysters were amazing!!!  They have a one of a kind bar too. Only con for me- I would've liked some steak and seafood combos without having to get two whole separate entrees, like steam topped with lobster- but that wasn't an option when we went."}
{"text":"Love at first sight when the bread basket came out.. What does that tell you? Oh my goodness! This place was amazing! 

 My husband made reservations to have dinner here and he requested a nice table in the tree house! So much fun! We were treated like royalty here!! Everyone was! Their customer service here at Mastros was superb!! They know how to make customers feel like they're having a great eating experience. 

We started with a bottle of Moscato! Nivole Moscato D'asti is my favorite!! 

I had a little trouble deciding what I wanted to eat for dinner, but when I saw the Chilean Sea Bass in the menu, I was hooked! They rubbed panko bread crumbs and fried it lightly to perfection!! My husband had the rib eye cooked medium well! And guess what? It was medium well!! They had a long list of sides. We went with the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, which had big chunks of fresh lobster. The lobster and potatoes just melted in your mouth because of all the butter! And then we had the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese! 

I was so sad that our hotel room did not have a refrigerator. I would have definitely took our left overs with me. As we left the restaurant, I was devastated! The food was absolutely delicious and I wished I had room in my belly to finish all of it!"}
{"text":"One of the best dinners we've had in Vegas! We had early reservations and the restaurant quickly filled after we arrived. The \"treehouse\" atmosphere was adorable yet elegant! The entire staff has very friendly and attentive. We ordered the Dungeness crab cocktail, Boston clam chowder, and Chilean sea bass with Ahi tune and mushrooms for our entrees. We both agreed that the Chilean sea bass was by far the best fish entree we've ever had! The sea bass was prepared perfectly (we opted for the fish to be grilled). My favorite type of crab is Dungeness... and it was super flavorful, tender and moist. Not one complaint with the entire experience. I even received a follow up phone call from the restaurant to ensure that we enjoyed our visit. We are both looking forward to returning to Mastros for another wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"The decor in this restaurant is pretty amazing even though it's in a high profile mall.  Who would've known!

The service, food, and drinks were all delicious.  They our large party of all ladies at the high tables with the high stools.  It probably would've been easier if we were seated at the regular tables as it was also very dim in that section of high tables. 

The steak and the fish were all very delicious and large portions.  So ladies it's ok to share!"}
{"text":"Our server, Brandon, was so extremely nice.

I took my family to Mastro's for my dads 60th birthday and he was ecstatic. The food was fantastic as I have gone to Mastro multiple times and they truly never let us down. The butter cake is phenomenal and easily one of my favorite desserts!"}
{"text":"We spontaneously decided to eat here tonight for dinner and they seated us right away which was great. The table we were assigned was not one we liked and they had no problem letting us sit beside the balcony instead... I ordered the oysters on the half shell and even though the month of July has no r in it, they tasted extremely fresh. Their horseradish is amazing! For an entree I ordered the scallops. I have not ordered scallops in years because it's such a difficult food for restaurants to really have fresh but this was a worthy choice. My partner is vegetarian and her sides were homemade mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts and asparagus. Everything was so good that we forgot to leave space for dessert... Even the complimentary bread was irresistible. Thanks Mario!"}
{"text":"We are locals and have been to Ocean club many times and it's our go to spot for celebrating and special events. 

This past Saturday was a complete disaster....from the moment we walked in we got the bad vibe. Dozens of people standing around the hostess station griping about waiting for overdue reservations added to which for some reason the hostesses thought it was a great idea to leave the front door open. It was very cold that night and there is almost no seating in the lobby so we went to the bar. 

After waiting 45 minutes after our scheduled time we expressed our frustration with one of the hostesses who told us \"we have no control over our customers and it's not our fault\" 

Back to the  bar we  went and waited another 15 minutes. As we were standing there getting bumped around by the wait staff, bus boys, and other customers in walks a guy who I swear looked like Ron Jeremy ( a 80 porn star ). Suddenly there were managers and staff carrying a table onto the floor especially for this one guy aka Ron Jeremy. He sits down right in front of us like he owned the place. 

Talk about mad we were steaming... Back to the hostess stand now over 1 hour passed our reservation we expressed our anger without cussing or threats and this time a different hostess got the message and our table was magically and instantly available. Off to our table and what do we see all the tables around ours are EMPTY!!! 

I wish I could say it got better...Nope, a trip to the bathroom where the attendant wanted to give me back $15 for a twenty...$5.00 to use the bathroom cmon this isn't Beverly Hills.

Back at the table where our waiter was friendly and apologetic but you could see in his face he was exhausted and ready to go home at 9:30. 

Our food was excellent as expected and saved the night for our guests who were at Ocean for the first time. 4 guests = $600.00 plus tip. 

We have guests coming in town again this weekend and we will NOT be going to Mastros...

I'm thinking Capital Grille instead...hopefully no Ron Jeremy sightings this weekend."}
{"text":"This will always be my favorite place to eat & eill continue to be but, When I asked about the steak sauces and got a full description at the tail end or beginning I feel the waiter should've used the words, \" At an additional cost or for a fee\".  He said nothing.  So when I saw the $5 which is nothing really but I was annoyed.  In my profession I am require to tell clients everything I know.  The asparigus I chose said \"Sauteed\".  Which means to mean with butter and so it was but also with garlic.  Un-smiley face, I was hoping to kiss my date after words not after that little secret they brought to my plate. I forgot how far away the table was I missed my date he was so far away.  Ha Ha.....The food was delicious as always and I will be a fan.  I just didn't like all of the things I felt I could've been told & was not. Oh, well next time I will be prepared for surprises that's all."}
{"text":"Very good food but I have to be hard on a place like this. You're paying top dollar for everything from environment to world class service and thus you'd expect the food to be equally top echelon, but I could nit pick my steak and the food's temperature. Sitting at the bar was not top echelon service attentiveness, just good. The chef and owner need to pay more attention to detail if they want to be seen as Las Vegas' best restaurant, which they very well could be."}
{"text":"We always wanted to try this restaurant and we were not disappointed. The level of service that we received was awesome. The bartender was knowledgeable with the menu and was able to provide great recommendations based off of people's preferences. 

Our waiter was the best. He provided us with the perfect suggestions for our selections of appetizers and entrees. The steaks were cooked perfectly and we are glad that we got the seafood tower. The only thing I wish is that I had a larger stomach. 

But to top it off, they even helped my wife and I celebrate our anniversary. They gifted us a butter cake to help us celebrate! 

This has easily become one of our favorites in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the ocean club from the drinks to the service to the amazing food. The Sea Bass Oscar Style is amazing with the creamed spinach. I love the butter cake at the end too. I am always so full I can barely walk out the door.
One time we went and had a seat at a table that had no sign and the waitress tried to tell us we couldn't sit there but the manager let us continue to sit there as there was no sign indicating we did anything wrong. I really thought that was really kind as well. The customer service really is stellar."}
{"text":"AMAZING dinner. We went here to celebrate my bday last week. Jamie was our server and he was fantastic.  I wanted stuffed lobster which they don't have on the menu, but Jamie said no problem and VOILA, a 2 pound lobster stuffed with crabmeat and scallops. I finished every bite. My boyfriend had NY strip, chefs cut which was so big he could not finish it (he has never left anything on his plate). We did half salads and the amazing mussels. And everything was perfect. To finish it off they brought me their famous butter cake. I typically do not eat dessert, but this was way too amazing to pass up. Thanks for the great experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars
The seafood tower was amazing and my ribeye was very good.  Very expensive.  Much better experience than the ocean club in Newport Beach."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: huge plus for being inside Crystals mall. Classy, a bit on chatty side.
Food: amazing!
Service: he meant well, but...

The snow crab claw was by far the best I've had. It's served cracked, fresh, and insanely cold with a dramatic dry ice presentation. 

Food and service deserves 5 stars, but here's what I want to take a point off of. Nobody warned us that portions were HUGE. We left half the food on the table, which was meant for one person. 

Keep in mind I am a size 0, it's not hard to guess I won't have a huge appetite.

The smooth talking waiter talked us into getting the steak special, 20oz bone in for $90-100, not on menu. He said it was for ONE person. Also he suggested the lobster mashed potatoes as a side and sushi roll. 

The steak was good, but too big for both of us to finish. 
Then the server hands me the charred bone bit - actually, more like plop it in the mashed potato - and tells me to eat the meat off of it. Really? Are you expecting me to lick my fingers off after I chew off the meat with my teeth and hands like a classy lady?

We opted for half portion lobster potatoes instead of a full, which was still a whole bowl of potato mash swimming in a pool of butter. Whatever happened to mixing?
The half portion of sweet potato fries had so much breading that I couldn't taste the sweet potato. I'm sure there's a lot of people who drool over this type of side dish, but I was certainly not one of them.

I'll give 4stars, but next time, please don't suggest ordering extra food when it's clear we can't even finish one plate. It's too good to waste!"}
{"text":"Super delicious, great service and most of all amazing displays with all the dishes! The martinis were good as well! (I don't typically order martinis but these ones made the cut) I tried many items here ranging from; duck, to crab, to shrimp and some drink dessert after that tasted like black licorice (forgot the name). Our waitress had a great sense of humor and yet was very professional!"}
{"text":"On 2/13/18 we had a reservation for two at 7:15.  We have been to this restaurant many times, but this was the last time.  We inquired several times, including to a gentleman that appeared to me to be a manager when we might be seated.  He explained that the \"two tops\" weren't turning very fast that night.  At 8 pm we were finally shown to a \"four top\" and noticed many empty tables.  It took ten to fifteen minutes to get a drink, but the kicker was after the appetizers were finished, the empty dishes stayed on the table with person after person just walking by like they were blind.  After ten minutes or so, I finally stopped one of the gentlemen and demanded that they clear the table.  Our server (who really did work hard trying to make up for everything) cleared the second course herself.  Finally at 9 when the food was served, we looked at each other and had them box it up.  The server did remove the drinks from the bill, but a manager never did come over, knowing we were quite annoyed.  This type of service might be okay when one spends $50 on dinner, but the food was over $300.

The food is consistently good, but for the prices they charge, the service does not match.  In fact, it doesn't match the restaurant's reputation at all.  It's interesting that their management thinks that it does."}
{"text":"I've been to two out in LA/Orange County area.  This one doesn't quite meet the same standard as set in California.  Still good, don't get me wrong.

Had the bone in filet.  It was cooked correctly, it just lacked flavor (as I'd expect from a bone in steak!).

The lobster gnocchi is always great.

Really enjoyed their wasabi salad (sorry- can't remember what it's called).

The restaurant itself is in a bit of a strange location- it's in middle of the mall. So atmosphere is very bright and you can see the stores while dining.  Didn't really like this setting for eating good steak."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant and we all got food poisoning. We called the manager who indicated that he would look into it. He never returned our call after we spoke to him. Do not go there as you could get food poisoning. Most managers of restaurants would call back as we had eaten there many times and he did not have the intelligence to return our call"}
{"text":"This place is always pretty good! This location in particular is a bit odd, though. You're literally eating in the mall much like a food court (with a large bill). But hey, at least you're surrounded by designer names..ha!) 

The seafood tower is the way to go. The bone-in filet is NOT the best thing on the menu despite what the masses say. It's a bit chewy. My girlfriend had a regular filet and it was much better and cooked perfectly.

The butter cake is terribly overrated. I always find that it's a bit dry and for lack-of-a-better thought....NOT worth the calories."}
{"text":"This is a premiere place.  It's priced that way also.  As long as you understand that you will enjoy the experience.  We went specifically because they had Stone crab claws on their raw bar.  We started with those along with two martini's.  They were delicious.  The bread basket blends the old steakhouse feel with the updated and vibrant space that Mastro's projects.  We shared the large bone in ribeye.  It was presented at the table sliced on a hot plate.  It was cooked perfectly as well as the spinach we ordered to accompany it.  We ordered the butter cake to take home and it was a highlight when we enjoyed it later that evening."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience which started with the hostesses, bubbly smile and welcoming personality. Heard many reviews about the bread basket, come on its bread. Now I eat those words. Several choices, sour dough roll, kalamata olive, pretzel (my fav) and others. I had seared ahi tuna. Generous portion cooked to perfection with wasabi and pickled ginger. My date had the pan sautéed scallops. She loved them and my taste was wonderful. She also had the lobster bisque. It was so rich and creamy.  For sides we had mushrooms, sautéed with garlic we loved them. Also had creamed spinach. We both thought it was fine, have had better. Both portions were very generous, more than enough for both of us. Service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great dining experience! It was my boyfriends 21st birthday weekend and I wanted to treat him to something special, and special it was. 
We were seated in the \"Treehouse\" and our server Lionell was the best, he gave us great recommendations and he was very attentive. We shared an order of the tempura shrimp for an appetizer, I had the twin lobster tails, my boyfriend had the new york strip and we shared a side of the creamed spinach. Wow, wow, wow is all I can say. They also brought out a huge slice of chocolate cake after dinner for my boyfriend, something he wasn't expecting, it was a nice surprise and we both really enjoyed it. 

The whole experience was great. We will definitely be back, no doubts about that."}
{"text":"Very cool decor and excellent service.  We just finished eating elsewhere before we found this hidden gem and were completely bummed we didn't find it sooner.  So we sat at the bar and had a nice glass of malbec - a very generous glass of wine - with a very friendly bartender, Melissa.  She explained the menu to us in great detail and told us exactly what we should order the next time we visited."}
{"text":"Great food and service!!!

{"text":"This is the epitome of fine dining! The restaurant is located inside what looks like a mall on the strip, and is in what looks like a cage. I came here for my girlfriends birthday. The service was excellent. We arrived at 5:30 pm, on a Saturday because we knew it would fill up for dinner time. They also only opened half hour before that. They provided us with delicious bread, one tasted like a pretzel. We each had a mixed drink. Mine was good, but my girls drink was excellent. It was a strawberry mixed drink. It tasted perfect! I ordered the largest steak; a 22oz. ribeye. It may have been the best steak I have ever tried in my life. Even the fat parts disintegrated in my mouth. My girl had the filet mignon. It was also delicious. 

For her birthday they brought her out a slice of cake that said 'Happy Birthday!' along with a fresh batch of whipped cream. All in all it was a memorable and splendid experience."}
{"text":"Great Filet Mignon. Asked medium rare but received it medium but still very juicy and tender.  Double baked loaded baked potato was huge and amazing.  Great for dates but was actually there with a bachelor party of 10 men and worked out great.  Very pricey but when in Rome.."}
{"text":"Overrated, expensive, dull and slow is what comes to mind when I think of this restaurant.  A group of my friends visited Ocean Club tonight (a Sunday evening in early October at 6pm) for a friend's birthday.  I was very disappointed with the quality and flavor of the food and the service, which I would rate as terrible, especially for a fine dining establishment such as this.

When you arrive it's clear that you're at a fine dining restaurant.  Dark rooms, fancy table settings, a well dressed wait staff.  It's too bad that our experience didn't match the ambiance.  In general everything just fell short--- beyond what you might expect at your typical over priced, stuffy steak house.

I ordered the Scottish salmon blackened.  It was cooked correctly (rare) but lacked in flavor.  The presentation was terrible- a filet on a white plate and a small cup of what resembled an olive tappenade.  I would have asked our waiter but he was largely absent with the exception of when he walked us through the menu upon arrival which largely just confused the group. My husband ordered a salad and two types of oysters.  He requested that they both be served as a main course.  The salad arrived as an appetizer.  When the oysters arrived no one pointed out which oysters were which- they left him guessing.  We ordered wine and had wanted a second bottle. We eventually were able to order it but well after our entrees had arrived.

In general we wanted to have a relaxed dinner but service was so slow that there were points when I questioned if the staff even remembered that we were in the dining room.  We also had interesting interactions with our busser.  She first came to remove the bread from the table.  She asked us if we were done, to which my husband said \"you know what, just leave it and we'll pick at it throughout the meal.\" She smiled at him, looked at the table and took the bread.  It was clear she didn't understand him.  She mumbled for the rest of the evening and in general was incomprehensible.  I was really surprised.

All is all this place was disappointing. There's lots of competition for high end dining and perhaps I'm a snob but if you can't get the small stuff right then it's not worth the cost especially when the food is just mediocre."}
{"text":"i felt like someone importanttttttttttt their service is amazing and the food... melts in your mouth like butter."}
{"text":"Disgusting customer service by manager Gill ! 
Just because your restaurant is busy gives you zero right to treat customers with such nasty attitude.. will take my money elsewhere"}
{"text":"I am not a steak connoisseur as I rarely eat red meat, but I did try my boyfriends rib eye when we ate here for his birthday and OH MY GOODNESS was it incredible! It was perfectly cooked as a \"medium rare\" steak as he requested, and it was melt in your mouth quality. I only have one other fancy steakhouse restaurant to compare it to and that's Ruth Chris' Steakhouse....And I would say this is better. The buttercake dessert is also to die for even though you might literally die from a heart attack from it because I'm sure it's not the healthiest thing out there, but it is sooo worth cheating any diet to try it! Again, I rarely eat red meat and I freaking love the steak here and believe that this may have been the greatest thing I've ever tasted. The texture and taste are both on point. I definitely want to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This is a follow up and it's long overdue. We did eventually hear back from the restaurant and the manager offered us a gift card so we can go back and try them again. I was extra careful on food choices at the 2nd visit: steak and chocolate cocktail (no seafood, no fresh veggies or fruit), and yes it was a great decision, no upset stomach this time! 5 star service, 4.5 food. Combined with my negative experience from 1st visit, solid 4 stars as a final."}
{"text":"There are three steakhouses in the country that are in a class by themselves.  The III Forks chain, Jean George (Aria/Vegas), and the Mastro's chain. The warm pretzel rolls, gigantic but perfectly ripe salads, perfect meat, and amazing desserts make this an absolute can't lose."}
{"text":"For my 1600th review, I chose the 3rd and final restaurant in the Scottsdale/Phoenix Mastro's trilogy.  I've dined at the other 2 restaurants and this was the last one....I am now complete! :)

What more can I say about this place?  Outstanding service and food!  Wifey and I dined with 2 colleagues from out of town.  They'd never dined at a Mastro's before, so we decided to go all out and give this location a try.  Here's what we ordered during this visit:

I had the Bone-in Filet and the Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese....these are my favorite Mastro dishes.  I sampled the Carpaccio, which was phenomenal....it's soo tender and full of flavor.  For Dessert, we all shared 1,000,000 calories worth of dishes (Buttercake, Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Cake, Whipped Cream)....but it's all good when you're dining in a top notch restaurant with great people.

I forgot to mention that we put away 2 bottles of Wine during dinner and a nice glass of Port at the end of dinner.  A perfect way to end an evening.

Tip - Don't forget that Mastro's is not cheap.  It's a fine dining joint....expect to pay for it.

Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"Nothing but greatness to be expected from Mastros and once again they lived up to their reputation. This was the first Mastros Ocean Club I have visited and i was very much impressed. DISCLAIMER: They do tend to undercook their steaks but they did take it back and fix my New York strip. And of course we had to try the seafood tower. I love that you can build it yourself! Our waiter was so pleasant and attentive. Seriously he just made the night. Wish I could remember his name but all I remember was thay he was Canadian lol Only because I am a die hard Michael Bublè fan lol"}
{"text":"Here's the bottom line, the food is GREAT, always is, quite pricey but that's a known fact. Visited the Keg in Chandler the night before and checked out their wine list, pretty amazing and the prices were great! Ocean Club has many of the same exact wines that The Keg had, same years, etc...the cost of the wine at Ocean Club were DOUBLE of the cost at The Keg, literally DOUBLE, sometimes more that DOUBLE, it was absolutely disgusting. We were all so taken aback that none of us ordered wine...Realizing the mark up on bottles of wine which we buy all the time at Total Wine and realizing the restaurant has to make a profit, this was absolutely out of line and turned me off completely. They also have the nerve to charge $48 for ONE stone crab, seriously ONE? I could fly to Vegas and eat at Joe's Stone Crab and get 6-8 at that price! The butter cake and homemade whipped cream were delish as always!"}
{"text":"Ocean Club was the 2nd leg of our progressive dinner last night (8-14-2013)  It was my dining companions birthday celebration and he had never been before.  I chose Ocean Club for our main course.  We were greeted promptly by name and seated immediately.  I had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day to drop off a birthday card and flowers for our table.  Yes a little redundant, but I'm all about going all the way or nothing at all!  At that time I explained that we were having appetizers 1st somewhere else and moving on to another restaurant for dessert. All was well when we were seated, card and orchid in place (whew).  I ordered Swordfish for myself and the bone-in Rib Eye/Crab leg combo for my companion.  I also ordered the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, and the Sautéed Mushrooms.  Our server Lloyd was amazing, treated us as if we were his only guests.  We were not!  Once we were finished, Lloyd had our leftovers boxed and sent us on our way knowing that we had a 3rd reservation waiting.Thank you to Lloyd and Mastro's Ocean Club for making it an amazing mid-course to our evening!!!"}
{"text":"Cool place to enjoy a nice dinner with friends. Upscale experience without a ton of fuss. Awesome servers who know their stuff. Very cool structure in the middle of Crystals that almost makes you forget you're in the middle of a bougie mall. Went with a group of 6 and everyone's food looked great. I got a Spicy Mambo Salad and would probably skip it next time, only because it's just a caesar salad, sans croutons with a hint of wasabi. Kinda boring, but not worth losing a star over. Sweet potato fries are bomb, as are the mac & cheese and mashed sweet potatoes. DO NOT SKIP THE BUTTER CAKE. Thank me later."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. Everything was seasoned just right, and it was served nice 'n hot on that 400-degree plate. 
If you like cocktails, I highly recommend the dream berry. And if you really want a party in your mouth, top your meal off with their delectable butter cake. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine or have a drink. Love the food and live music. Bartender could be friendlier, but overall great experiences when I go there. Management is awesome."}
{"text":"I've been fascinated by this \"tree house\" for the longest. This was my first time visiting Mastro's and I had long heard of the famous warm butter cake, so I was excited to come for a pharm. rep dinner, get to learn and try a new place. 

We made our selections from a pre-set menu.

My first course I went with the Caeser Salad, this was pretty standard except for the bits of anchovie throughout, which is my favorite kind of Caeser. 

For my entree I chose the 8oz filet. I asked for it to be prepared medium. What came out was between rare and tartare. Since we were in a small private dining room for the lecture, I didn't feel comfortable sending my steak back, it would be disruptive, and I didn't want to interupt the lecturer. I ended up giving it to my friend to take home to her dogs.

The family style shared sides weren't impressive either. Mashed potatoes had no flavor, and the sugar snap peas as well. Only one I liked was the creamed spinach. 

Dessert we had a choice between chocolate sin cake and cheesecake. I went with the chocolate cake, it came with a side of homemade whipped cream which I thought was better than the cake itself. 

Pretty disappointing meal all together. I would come back for a second try, just not in a hurry to do so. I definitely enjoyed the lecture more than dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Everything was perfect. Dinner ran about $300 pp including alcohol and tips but we were dining extravagantly. I cannot wait until I win the lotto so I can eat here once a week!"}
{"text":"This was just an amazing meal.  Wish we could have been seated in the large wood sculpture portion, but a great meal none the less.  

Thanks!

Oh and thanks for the call the next day.  That was a 4 star to 5 star conversion"}
{"text":"I don't say this much.  OMG, this place is amazing.  I was in Vegas with friends, and my buddy said i should try this place out  and i would love it.  i was skeptic at best..

We had a group of 8 and we decided to do family style and order apps.  We ordered the bone marrow, escargot, scallops, and calamari  

The bone marrow was okay in my opinion, but everyone loved it on my table.  I would have like some more accompaniment to enhance the flavors.  There was plenty of marrow, bread and  micro greens, and fine sea salt flakes.  It was very rich and flavor, but i had better.  it is still worth it.

The scallops were perfectly pan seared, and it came with a pleasant herb-y butter sauce.  Each bite was amazing and when you are done with the scallops.  The sauce was great for  bread  dipping.

The escargot was good.  it came with the standard butter, garlic and shallots.  T
here is probably a few other herbs in there, but we ate them too fast to really look.
.  
The friend calamari was good and came with two sauce, tartar, and i think a remoulade.  After having the other items, i wasn't too impressed.  This would be a great dish, if it was somewhere else. But we are talking about Mastro's.

The OMG moment was a  bone in petite filet we ordered.  When i first saw it, i was very disappointed when i saw the waiter cut it,  It look raw.  I was thinking how can a place like this, don't know the difference between medium rare and raw.  Boy was i wrong.  The table decide we should try it and not waste it, because we all thought the same thing.  But when i bit into it, it was the most wonderful steak i had in recent memory.  It has a full of flavor, it was season to perfection.  Every bite, i wanted another one.   In the end, i would have fought off the table for the bone.  Lucky for me, no one wanted it.  I love the acidic marinade they used for the steak.  I guess it is a balsamic vinegar marinade.  Man, i want to go back so badly.

Anyway, i don't think i can top anything else in this review.  I have to say the signature pound cake was good, but you must really have a sweet tooth.  

Waiters and bus people were amazing and entertaining.  they are here to give you the best experience they can.    so please tip well.

The decor is amazing, just go look at the pictures online.  

Now i just want to go to any Mastro's and have that steak again."}
{"text":"Excellent food,service and ambiance. The original Masteros in AZ is a go to favorite. The Vegas version doesn't disappoint. 

In the landscape of Vegas dining where return visits are rare to the scale and innovation of dining venues. Masteros will get additional visits from myself, family and corporation."}
{"text":"I had the crabcakes, ahi tuna, seared scallops, gnocci with truffles, spinach, chilean sea bass (I like this fish for future reference), and creme brulee with homemade whipped cream (best whipped cream ever).  WOW.  It sounds like so much food now - no wonder i was hurting!!!!  Don't worry though - the pain is gone."}
{"text":"Really bad experience, here. Was hoping for an awesome night for my 50th birthday. Based on reviews, I chose Mastro's. Wish i hadn't. Filet came out well done, sent it back, came out raw in the middle. A fine restaurant that can't cook a filet to medium rare should just close its doors. On top of that, my wife and son's NY strips tasted like liver. Not sure how they achieved that. The manager was very apologetic and tore up the check, but I still can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"My friend made reservations for Christmas Day dinner 2 weeks prior to Christmas. When we arrived we were told 40 minute wait for the \"treehouse\" which she requested. She was furious. We were seated 5 minutes later, I'm really not sure what the deal was, but we didn't have to wait. Drinks were good as was the service, however the food was not great. The mac and cheese was lacking the cheese. I ordered lamb chops and they were cooked ok, medium rare, but lacked flavor. Totally not impressed. I ate half my lamb, and we got a go bag for everything else. When I got home my lamb never made it to the go bag. Really? $48 for 1/2 an order of lamb. This place is pathetic. Go to Del Frisco's if you truly want to be impressed. Epic fail here!"}
{"text":"My new favorite steak and seafood house in Las Vegas. 
Went again last night and had a magnifcent experience!

The manager, Scott, is a terrific guy.
Our server, Sylvia, was charming and attentive.
And the food...
How about a 32 oz bone-in ribeye!! OMG!
(I'm just getting out of the hospital now...had my blood cleaned.)

It was worth it.
That's why Crestor was invented."}
{"text":"Several friends were in town and they booked dinner at a different restaurant, after the entrees were consumed I suggested we walk a few blocks to Mastro's Ocean Club in the Crystals at CityCenter for desert and nightcap beverages. It's one of my favorite steakhouses in Vegas and #1 choice for outstanding deserts and port wines or a glass of late harvest liquid gold (Far Niente Dolce). Made a quick reservation on Yelp and we showed up around 9:30pm. The bar was lively. I ordered one Chocolate Pudding Cake and one Cherry Crisp, plus the \"100 years flight of Port flight\" and a glass of Dolce. The dark chocolate pudding cake was warm, fresh, and delicious. The liquid cream and fresh whipped cream, serving of blackberries and mint were exceptional and we all enjoyed. The Cherry Crisp was scrumptious. Highly recommend this venue as the architecture is remarkable, service attentive and friendly (Kaitlyn was wonderful) and it's convenient to The Strip action."}
{"text":"Best experience in Vegas. Everyone was an absolute pleasure. Our waiter and Aaron made sure our time was spectacular. My sister and I both had the 12 oz filet with truffle butter and I must say it was phenomenal I couldn't put my fork and knife down. We also had the Cesar salad, mac and cheese and lobster mash so happy we came here. Thank you so much for everything we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Completely different experience from the first time we dined here. We started in the beautiful bar area where we each had a Mastros signature cocktail. The Fashion Forward was a refreshing twist on the old fashioned and the hubs had a classic martini with a lemon twist. For dinner we shared the chefs cut bone in ribeye 33oz of medium rare heaven! Truffle buttered mushroom and a side of lobster mashed potatoes to die for. Our server Duke was amazing as well as Erma so friendly and helpful. 
Our dining experience lasted nearly 3 hours we truly enjoyed every minute of it. 
Minus 1 star because the gift card that was sent to us from Corporate was not accepted ??? Regardless we are happy to have given Mastro's a second chance."}
{"text":"No surprise here.  MASTRO'S always does a great job.  The martinis,  the food and the service were all superb. We had to split the check for 4 of us 8 ways due to no alcohol is allowed to be on an expensable reciept. This was NO PROBLEM which is not usually the answer. The dungeness crab app was to die for. Everything was perfect ."}
{"text":"I went here with colleagues while in Vegas at a conference. Happy I was there for work as it was quite a pricey dinner. Overall, it was a great experience, the service was good and the food and drinks were overall good, but not necessarily amazing (thus the 3 star rating).

Drinks: they have a great cocktail list. The first one I had was a nice smoky drink with a little bit of spice. I also had the spa day which was a strong but refreshing cucumber drink. The drinks were pricey ($15-$25) but everyone seemed to be happy.

Appetizers: We had shrimp, calamari and bone marrow. All was tasty and I would order again.

Main meal: For the main meal, I had the pacific swordfish Cajun style. This is where my rating got downgraded. My fish was a bit over cooked and this dry.

Given the variety of restaurants in Vegas, I likely would not go back."}
{"text":"We dined at the Ocean Club last night, must have been 5 yeas since we have been here. As we remembered. it was great. Great crowd, fast seating, very attentive service, and great food. 

Very crowded for a late Sat. night, and it was a fun night out. May have to come back sooner than 5 years."}
{"text":"This is now my 4th trip there and I wouldn't be doing the place justice If I didn't write a review. Steaks: huge, cooked right, and delicious. Seafood- fresh fresh fresh.  On the late fall the stone crab claws are the largest I've ever seen.   Prices: on par w the rest of SIN CITY for a high end place 
The real difference is the service. We literally had 7 people taking care of a table of 4. They are on top of everything. 
If you want a high end meal or want to impress business clients, this is a no brainer."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place because I really loved the vibe when I walked in. Busy social good music and upbeat.Had the food not been a trio us we would be back every weekend. Our steaks were burnt the potatoes were way too strong. I'm not sure how a steak house burns a steak but it was nearly inedible.  Had we not been with friends and on our best behavior we would have sent it all back but due to it being my birthday and my friends we tried eat what we could (the middle of the steak) I'm so dissappointed. I was expecting Ruth ' s Chris taste with a club atmosphere. If I ever go back it won't be for the food"}
{"text":"40th Bday dinner for my girl and what can I say....Mastro's didn't disappoint. Once again our food/service was awesome, ambience great and drinks were too good! 

* Try the dream berry martini if you like strawberries.
*  Try the Mambo salad. It is a Cesar salad with horseradish in the dressing so it has a spicy kick. Have them serve it with shrimp for something really delicious.
* Lobster mash is good and sinful. Don't let it get cold"}
{"text":"We had dinner one night at Mastro's, and what a great choice!  I can honestly say everyone on staff made our dining experience a complete delight.

For dinner I got the chopped salad, gulf red snapper, and the twice baked potato.  In addition, our server also brought some warm, fresh bread out to the table.  Everything was SO GOOD.  Truly, the fish was so fresh I would not be surprised if it had been caught that very same day.  The seasoning on all the food was perfect, and I didn't have to add salt, pepper or anything.  Truly tantalizing.  The portions were also large.  The potato was definitely big enough to split with at least one other person.

To top off my experience, someone from the restaurant actually called me the next day to ask how our experience was!  That was a first for me, and I was majorly impressed.  The next time I go back to Vegas, we will definitely be stopping in at Mastro's again."}
{"text":"Mastro's has a name for a classy dinner out, no contest there. This location delivered, I was impressed by how great the service was as well as how much fun dining with live music is. 

I have a shellfish allergy... I know why go to The Ocean Room?? but it wasn't my birthday so this is where we ate. The server was very responsive to my request to make sure my food was safe for me. 

I had the bone in filet, medium rare plus. Red but warm center. Wow tasty meat. It was 12oz ands nearly ate it all. Another highlight, butter cake! I'm a chocoholic but this buttery lightly toasted and served warm cake was worth the caloric intake."}
{"text":"Was planning a trip to Scottsdale from out of state for a sunny bday weekend. Looked a various restaurants nearby and when I saw Mastro's dinner menu, I was sold! 

The whole experience was amazing: decor, food, server, cocktails/wine, and the towel service in the restroom. 

Came mainly for the seafood and it was all amazing. Will have to plan another trip down to Mastro's as the steaks looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Mastro's Beverly Hills is my favorite steakhouse in LA, so I was eager to check out the Vegas branch. While there are obviously similarities, here are the differences:

1. There's a separate room inside what's called the Treehouse, but it looks more like a giant wooden stomach. Which is appropriate. I'd strongly recommend getting seated there and not because of the view (The \"breathtaking\" scenery consists of every high-end luxury goods store on this planet. Then again, I know people who enjoy staring at $5000 handbags from a distance.). It's because the other half of the restaurant looked packed as hell. I wouldn't be surprised if the diners were eating their neighbors steaks by accident. 

2. There's more fish on the menu - hence the name - although there was no noticeable difference shellfish selection-wise. Sadly, Billy Ocean wasn't singing at the piano. Mastro's, you screwed up on a golden opportunity here.

3. The bar's wall o' liquor is an impressive monument to chronic liver failure. Then again, this is a city where it's legal to walk down the street slurping Everclear out of a foot-long Eiffel Tower. 

4. Steak's great. But not comparable to the Beverly Hills branch."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by a family member who lives in Scottsdale. The atmosphere is upscale, classy and dimly lit. 
Our server was informative and attentive. He provided helpful responses to our menu questions.  I started with the lobster bisque which was flavorful and included lumps of lobster meat.  My entree was the Sea Scallops which were toped with a wine sauce and lightly broiled.  Awesome!!  My friend had the salmon and the macaroni and cheese with bacon.  Our waiter suggested ordering the crumbled bacon with the Mac and Cheese.  It was delicious.  Our food was promptly delivered to our table while it was at the appropriate temperature.
It was a superior dining experience and I highly recommend it for seafood."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievable front the time we walked into the time we left the service was great. The food was perfect  as well. I got a steak that was perfect. The lobster  mashed potatoes were great as well. They are for sure a must try."}
{"text":"So the food is decent. I'm not gonna sit here and say it's BAD, cause it's not. But I'm. It gonna say it's AMAZING either cause it's NOT. The service is great. And the butter cake is beautiful and it IS AMAZING."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. awesome execution, and a wonderful wine list - This was the best meal I had in Las Vegas this year. I went back twice this week! Gnocchi with Alaskan crab ,truffle oil then topped with shaved black truffle and crisped panko bread crumbs is decadent and delish! It is served sizzling and definitely  enough to share between two people. I ordered a half portion the second visit and it still was enough between the two of  us! One of the best things i have ever eaten. I am picky about gnocchi and they do it light and pillowy here with a white sauce. On to the steaks, PRIME CUT EVERYTHING! all steaks are served on 400 degree plates with clarified butter and ur choice of salt/pepper or u can request cajun blackened. Phenomonal steaks and yes I am from Texas and still say this, My favorite winery is Michael David from Lodi  ..they make the good ol 7Deadlyzins, petite petit sirah and Mastros serves their Earthquake Cab for only two times markup (51 bucks)! this is a GREAT value for Vegas . SW steakhouse in the Wynn charges an obnoxious 5x markup! - This is important if you love wine with ur steaks. I had filet mignon, tomahawk ribeye,  truffle crab gnocchi, chocolate pudding cake, gorgonzola mac and cheese, lobster roll, and oysters rockefeller this week at mastros. The gnocchi , steaks and lobster roll were NOT TO BE MISSED here. I wasnt crazy about the mac and cheese but that may be because I was totally spoiled by the gnocchi(priced at 32 full portion, 16 for half portion) . If you are budgeting however the mac is only 13 and 6.50 for a half portion. try it you will love it ! Our waiter was excellent and attentive , this place is worth the money in the big pool of steakhouses in Vegas"}
{"text":"One of the best places with top notch service, atmosphere, fine dining in  Vegas. 

I always get the 18 oz bone in filet with lobster mash. 

They have an extensive wine list aswell. 

Great place for a business meeting."}
{"text":"It's my second visit at this particular Mastros. Kinda hard to find. 
The restaurant is inside the mall \"The shops at Crystals,\" next to Aria hotel. 
Just look for the giant wood art sculpture second floor of mall. it is breathtaking. 

I love love love their lobster bisque 
Ordered the filet mignon with garlic mash potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts. For added flavor and $$$ I added truffle butter   It was awesome! Bread basket warm and delicious. My favorite is the pretzel bread. 

My son had the Chilean sea bass. It just melts in your mouth. We had it simply prepared as pan seared. 
My husband and other son had steak too and they were so focused on their meal so I know they loved their steaks. 

Our server Micheal provided great service. lt all ended with their famous butter cake with homemade fresh whipped cream. 

Our meal for a family of four was costly but worth every penny. 
We visit Mastros every time we come to Vegas. See you next time"}
{"text":"I stopped here with a co-worker after a business meeting in Scottsdale.  We had a redeye flight late that night and wanted a nice meal before heading to the airport.

We got there early before the dinner crowd, and finished up some work form our meeting and then enjoyed a glass of wine and dinner.   I'm a vegetarian so I ordered a salad.  Salad was definitely tasty, but my coworker raved about her fish.  She said it was the best she'd ever had.    Sometimes when you read great reviews it leaves space for disappointment, but that was definitely not our experience.  I'd go here again when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago and have been to many fine dining restaurants. The Mastros in Chicago is my absolute favorite place to eat. I went to Las Vegas and noticed they also had a Mastros so I naturally made sure I go. There is no way I could actually like Mastros any more than I already do right? Wrong! Mastros Ocean Club was even better than the high bar that the Chicago location set. Aside from world class food, Tanya and Juan, who waited on me, were the absolute best servers I have ever had. They know the restaurant food very well and its almost amazing how they know almost every ingredient used in every dish. They also gave me great recommendations for the rest of my time in Vegas and were just overall great servers. Not only does Mastros have some of the best quality food around, and the ambiance is second to none, but Tanya and Juan made it such a great time that I can not wait to see them again this upcoming February! No matter what you will love Mastros but if they are working, make sure you sit with Juan and Tanya for a truly exceptional dining experience!!!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed when in Scottsdale and dining at Ocean Club!
Excellent service (always!) and the food beautifully prepared and served.
Word of advice- everything can be split and unless you are a typical American-you'll walk away stuffed like their clams! Sides are all great too!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends.  We were sat in the modern tree house which over looked the crystals mall, I would definitely ask to be sat there.  Everyone was hungry so we got right down to business, Crabcakes, Oysters Rockefeller and seared ahi tuna to start followed by the 22oz bone in ribeye for myself with creamed spinach and sweet potato fries.   Apps were flavorful,  Steak was cooked perfectly Midrare and the sides dishes were great .  Service was impeccable as expected. Overall great dinning experience, wasn't the best steak I've had but definitely worth trying even though technically this restaurants prime focus is seafood."}
{"text":"Review for Restaurant Week Fall 2012 menu only:

I went to Mastros tonight for the first time and I convinced my wife to try Restaurant Week, too!  We were very pleased with the meal.

We got a nice bread basket with several types of bread.  I really liked the pretzel rolls with salt.  There were five choices in the basket.

Course 1:  We each got a salad--my wife's was a Caesar and mine was their spicy mambo salad.  They were both the same greens but my dressing was made with some wasabi, hence the spicy.  Both salads had a good amount of freshly grated cheese on them and they were very tasty.

Course 2:  I ordered the Scottish salmon and Andrea got the 8 ounce filet cooked medium.  I had several preparations from which to choose for the salmon and I chose the blackened option.  The salmon was delicious.  The filet was very good, too.  

With their Restaurant Week menu, diners can choose two sides.  We each ordered garlic mashed potatoes.  My wife ordered the creamed spinach and I got the creamed corn.  The sides were huge.  Since we each ordered the mashed potatoes, we got a regular portion which is their standard size for sides.  The corn and spinach were smaller versions.  All three were very good.  I needed salt, but then anything needs salt.  Samantha started us out by giving each of us some of the sides so we each could try everything.

Course 3:  For dessert, Andrea got the chocolate layer cake and I got the Key lime pie.  ALong with the desserts, we were brought a large bowl of freshly made whopped cream--lightly sweetened.  The chocolate cake was huge.  My Key lime pie was more a normal size.  Both were outstanding!!

We ate in the Tree House overlooking the shops at Crystals.  Service was superb!  Our server, Samantha, was excellent.  The staff cleared tables promptly, cleaned the table cloth between (not that I'm a slob or anything), our iced teas were refilled often, and the pace of the meal was perfect!  

I am so glad Mastros participated in Restaurant Week.  It gave me a chance to try it and I will be back.  What a fantastic start to RW Fall 2012."}
{"text":"Today was our friend's birthday and our server Tanya was so friendly and really went out her way to make sure our dining experience was excellent! The food was delicious and Tanya was very knowledgable and friendly. We had such a lovely time at Mastros Ocean Club and next time we come to Vegas we would love to come back!!! Thank you Tanya and Mastros for ensuring that our lovely experience!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Dion our server was awesome made the visit a 5 star visit on top of great food. We had the rib eye bone in with scallops potatoes and sautéed asparagus AWESOME! For dessert we had the butter cake OMG! We loved it!"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times in the last year  the staff is freely and very attentive. This time we got to sit in the Bird house which is really cool.  

The first time was great had the Herb Roasted Chicken*24oz, Lobster Bisque Soup & Heirloom Tomato & Burrata, Creamed Spinach, Creamed Corn, Grilled Asparagus but the best part was the dessert that Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake is by far the best dessert you will every taste.  

So on our second visit we wanted to see if they could repeat it.  Again we got the Herb Roasted Chicken*24oz - it really is very good and enough for two to share.  We got the Blue Cheese wedge and the  for the sides this time we stuck to the same creamed spinach, creamed corn but added the onion rings )which are fantastic) and the grilled Brussels Sprouts(i have to admit these were not bitter at all.)  then came the end that Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake was even better then I remembered its so gooey it melts in your mouth, you have to have it warm because we have stopped by just got the cake to go and it was server cold s not the same.  

I recommend to anyone weather you live in Vegas or visiting try this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best steak I've had compared to: del frisco's, papa's, Perry's, Ruth Chris, Flemings, the strip house, Vic and Anthony's, Morton's .... All of them and more. 

I don't remember what my cocktail was but it was a strawberry drink with a sugar rim. The shaker had an endless amount. I ended up with at least 3 full refills for $18.

The calamari was crispy and deceptively flavorful. They appeared to be plain, but the seasoning was just right. I did not care for the horseradish/mustard type sauce though, but I think that was just my dislike for those types of condiments. 

I ordered the 12oz filet medium rare. It had a beautiful seared crust that was crispy and not burned. The inside was so perfectly tender juicy red and melted in my mouth. The texture of the two was perfect. 

For sides we had the baked potatoe which was huge! But was the least appetizing item all night. The Gorgonzola Mac and cheese was delicious! I don't tend to like blue cheeses or very much cheese, but this cheese goodness was Devine. I enjoyed it so much I'm going to try to remake this this week for dinner! It was served in it's own skillet and was more than enough for myself and my two othe dinner companions. 

Warm butter cake. What can I say but order this! I usually love tiramisu and cream brûlée but mmmm this cake was so moist and had a crunch sugar top under the vanilla ice cream. The cream brûlée was actually disappointing. I didn't care for the crust or Vanilla flavored cream... Or perhaps the butter cake just stole my heart.

The live small band sounded great with dinner. They werent too loud and the music was a good mix, classy good sounding modern and hit music, not clubby like stk. you wo t leave with a headach and sore throat.The atmosphere of the restaurant was light and elegant. I didn't mind that it was located in the crystals. Honestly I liked being able to walk around while we waited for our reservation we made through aria, our hotel. If you do have a bit of a wait go down stairs to the little water tornadoes. They are touch sensitive and you can control how they spin!"}
{"text":"Food was good had the lobster 2 ways buttered and vanilla battered! Also we had the mashed potato, green beans, and the twice baked potato. Service was great as well"}
{"text":"Growing up in Beverly Hills I have attended the Mastro's on Cañon close to 100 times. They have the best steak in the game, I don't care what anyone try's to say. Last night me and my friend Paul had the night off in Vegas so we decided to check out the Mastro's here in Las Vegas at City Center. It not the traditional Mastro's setting but the food was still remarkable! Our waiter Deion was the man he helped my friend choose the perfect wine to accompany his bone-in filet topped with foie gras! Which just melted in ur mouth! (Pause) I myself took down the 22oz Bone-in Ribeye cooked medium rare plus like a beast and enjoyed every single bite! Once again Mastro's was an A+! Pictured below was the Bone-in Ribeye."}
{"text":"BEST SEA BASS IN MY LIFE.  The portion was much bigger than I was expecting, and because I ordered it medium rare, the fish was cooked just right!  Everyone at our 8-person table had either the sea bass, rib-eye, or bone-in filet, and everyone's dish was delicious.  Would definitely come back here!!!"}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club is a wonderful fine dinning restaurant that you will want to return to again and again.

Make reservations or you will not be getting in. Don't dress like you are going to a buffet. I suggest a jacket for men and something nice for women. 

Once you get there you are greeted by lovely people. You will be seated in a beautiful space with comfortable chairs. They have a full bar and an extensive, and very expensive wine list. Not being rich, I skip the wine so I can have more starters. All of them are amazing.

They have the best oyster rockerfeller you will find in the state. As for mains, the sea bass, any steak, the lobster and any fresh fish are cooked to perfection. Get the lobster mashed potatoes. Get two--I do, but I forgot about a diet years ago. They are just heaven. 

You are never rushed but there is great service and they are there when you need them. Have the best time."}
{"text":"Best food love it there i am always in the one in nyc  and now in vegas love this one to !!!!good scene great staff Craig the waiter was so nice and professional  the way it should be !!! A must go"}
{"text":"I went to a Mastro's in Chicago with my brother. I loved their butter cake so much that after seeing a show in Vegas, I took my wife to experience the greatness that is Mastro's Butter Cake. 

If you haven't tried it and you are on death row, this should be your final meal (for dessert). If you are not on death row or in prison, you should definitely make a trip and try it out. The rest of their food is really good as well, but we came for THE dessert. 

I can't describe it, except it is scrumtralecent. I envy anyone who lives within an hour of Mastro's. If you live within an hour and haven't tried it yet you should be deported... to Idaho."}
{"text":"If you want seafood in AZ, this is the place to go....actually, this is the best seafood I've ever had.

The scene:
Okay....the bar area?  Older crowd, for sure.  It was actually quite entertaining watching these older women trounce around like they're still 20something, getting hit on by the older men...well men probably in their age bracket.  

The food:
Great.  Amazing.  The presentation and service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this was not one of those awesome Mastro's visits that everyone raves about. We've been to both Mastro's in OC and the one in LA and this was by far the least pleasant visit. We've also been to a lot of the high-end restaurants in LV and typically skipped Mastro's because we could get it easily when we lived in SoCal. But now that we live out of state, we were craving BUTTER CAKE!

When Mastro's called to confirm our reservations, we mentioned that we would be coming in straight form the airport, and they said it wouldn't be a problem to store our luggage during dinner. Upon arrival, they didn't have any room in the clutter closet behind the hostess stand. We brought our luggage to the dinner table which was slightly awkward but there was room.

We had two different main waiters and the service was a bit off. The appetizers were cleared from the table and placed on a stand next to us...not sure why they weren't just removed. Then the entrees came - we were warned about the hot plates but they were barely warm. I ordered the steak medium rare and parts of it was rare so I didn't eat it. It took a long time to flag down someone to get our dessert order. I had previously mentioned in my OpenTable reservation that we were celebrating a friend's birthday. Mastro's was very kind in bringing out a slice of chocolate cake for her with a message written on the plate. When the butter cake finally came out, it was also not very warm. We didn't finish the cake but it was still pretty delicious.

Maybe this experience was an anomaly or off night, but we won't be back soon. Even if the butter cake is divine."}
{"text":"Amazing! Incredible treehouse setting, stupendous service and great food. Las Vegas has a new jewel high atop the rather dull Crystals shopping center at the dreary City Center. I can't tell you how wonderful the entire experience dining at Mastro's is--it's magical. Go, enjoy and bring your camera and appetite."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and amazing service!  Not to mention the food is just fabulous.  We started with tuna tartare which was good but nothing spectacular.  But then for the main entree I got the bone-in filet with a side of Mastro's mashed potatoes.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium rare and the flavor was melt-in-your-mouth delicioso.  Even the simple mashed potatoes was creamy and savory.  It sure is a splurge but I highly recommend it if you are in Vegas and want to pamper your tastebuds."}
{"text":"The most amazing steak I have ever had.  Silence fell over the table as we ate. I was pleased with the suggestion of wine and the sides were to die for.  We had mashed potatoes with enormous chunks of lobster.  Wow!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service that matched a great array of fresh and exquisite shellfish selection. The mains were also a delight but I found the sides to be quite rich (which took away from the main attraction), substantial and unnecessary. The wine list was a fairly condensed affair but what was on offer certainly complimented their menu satisfactorily."}
{"text":"This meal was FANTASTIC!
      We started with the calamari, it was so fresh with a spice on it and the sauce was tasty. The bread was fresh and I just love a good piece of bread yum! My husband had a salad and he enjoyed it greatly.

For the main course I ordered Chilean Sea Bass, OMG! prepared just right. My fish just melted in my mouth. I forgot what my husband ordered but he was completely statisfied. We ordered the Gnocchi and the sauteed broccoli as our sides, loved the Gnocchi and the broccoli was good. 

I cannot recall if we had desert, but if we did I'm sure it was great. As far as ambiance goes, the place was nice and they had live music going thoughout dinner and we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"So I am a huge fan of Mastro's and frequent their Costa Mesa and Newport locations. I gotta say that this was pretty close to the CA locations, minus a few minor details. From the pretzel bread to the seafood tower appetizer, I was pleasantly reminded of home sweet home (OC). The atomic horseradish is the perfect paring with your chilled seafood, and that is the perfect way to kick off you meal at Mastro's. I ordered my usual bone-in ribeye and sides of lobster mashed potatoes, creamed corn, grilled asparagus and creamed spinach - all were pretty good. The finale AKA warm butter cake, is where they finally dropped the ball. They brought it out and it was cold. Now this is a dessert that you absolutely must eat piping hot, and considering I had just ordered a dinner for 9 people and 2 bottle of Caymus, was not too thrilled at the anticlimactic ending to my meal. The service was great and I would definitely eat here again. Maybe was just a minor miss on the dessert? Anyways, Mastro's remains my favorite steakhouse and I will definitely give it another shot next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"The first time I dined at one of the Mastro's was over 5 years ago in SoCal.  I was with co-workers celebrating a huge case and were told to expense our entire meal.  My first experience was over-the-top due to the amount of money that was spent for dinner, desserts, beers, and alcohol.  I never had the chance to try Las Vegas' Mastro's until recently. 

We were celebrating Valentine's Day a couple of days before the actual day to avoid the crowds.  We arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation and was immediately seated. Service throughout our entire dinner was as good as expected from a place like Mastro's.  We were served bread pretty much as soon as we sat.  The entire bread basket was very good.  The bread basket consist of a dinner bread, garlic bread, and pretzel bread. The basket had two of each, which is perfect if you're sharing with just one other person.  I ordered the 8 oz. filet and it was marvelous.  It's so lean, tender, and enough to keep me satisfied for a few hours.  We also shared the twice baked potato and this was a beast.  It's huge and a half serving is equivalent to most restaurant's full sized potato.  The highlight of the evening had to be dessert.  I have steak all the time and have to admit that I was looking forward to their Signature Warm Butter Cake the whole evening.  The dessert is really simple....just a butter cake, ice cream, strawberry drizzle, and heavy whipped cream.  Every part of this dessert was amazing.  Trust me, the Signature Warm Butter Cake is worth the trip to Mastro's."}
{"text":"So after searching many of the fine dining restaurants online  in Phoenix I decided on MOC 12/8/17.
I was celebrating my girlfriends birthday so I wanted her to enjoy her dinner most of all. The food was excellent! We started out with 1/2 dz oysters and the calamari which was great. Then we both had the petite filets, lobster mash potatoes and roasted Brussel sprouts. The food was awesome! Here is my complaint.. I knew the cost going in and was ok with it, I mean it's fine dining. My issue was our waiter. From the very moment he presented us with the menus he tried to push the most expensive items. From the wine, to the appetizers, entrees and even the after dinner drinks. I spent $300 for the two of us and had no qualms about it! I can read and I knew the cost so I just can't fathom other than tip why he would insist the way he did. It was annoying and we finished one bottle of wine and after he suggested another, we declined it was like he went MIA on us. We tip well when treated well at min 20% but he was not deserving of more than the 17% I begrudgingly gave only because I was thinking of the bus boys and the tip out. MOC talk your staff, no need to push those items, most patrons going to places such as yours I think will tip accordingly and considering your prices I'd say your waiters probable do ok for themselves w/o the push!  Could have easily been 4 stars...."}
{"text":"My my my...what a treat it was to eat here. From start to finish, the food tasted superb, and service was impeccable. 

FOOD HIGHLIGHTS
* Bread basket: Served steamy and warm with Mastro's fresh salted butter. Pretzel bread and cheesy, cracker-like breadsticks were my favorites.
* Truffle-lobster gnocchi appetizer special: The chewiest, richest gnocchi I've tried, with tender lobster meat and drizzled with truffle oil.
* Bone-in filet steak, medium rare: Soft, tender beef, topped with clarified butter and a pinch of herbs. Served on a 400 degree plate, so it stays nice and toasty throughout your meal!
* Butter cake: Devastatingly moist, melty, slightly salty, and of course, buttery, with a crisp crust, a scoop of French vanilla ice cream, and whole plate of freshly whipped cream. Not overrated in any sense of the word.

I'm going to stop writing now because I'll drool all over my work laptop keyboard otherwise..."}
{"text":"Mastro's you ought to be ashamed.

First let me say this is a terrific nightclub as far as crowd and drinks.  The talented bar staff makes wonderful cocktails from martinis, manhattans, old fashioned, etc.  

And there isn't a better place in the valley to mingle with the wonderfully attractive local ladies.

But the live entertainment is/was an embarrassment on my visit last week.  The three person combo involved a girl on the piano, and female singer and fella on rhythm guitar.  Mastro's why do you hire impersonators as musicians?  The gal on the piano could actually sing.  But more than half the time the persons were simply imitating a soundtrack being played:  she wasn't even pushing down the piano keys, the guitar fella was embarrassing how he pretended to play and the other gal couldn't sing, or was told not to.  Really awful.  Years ago the club has some terrific musicians and played LIVE music.

I'll be back for sure, it pains me to give them a 2 star review because this really is one of the best bars/nightclubs in the country.  

But c'mon!!!  Try  a little harder Mastro's."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was delicious. We were in a hurry to get to a concert and they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"I went for a birthday dinner last night and everyone had steak except me because I don't eat red meat. I had chopped salad without romaine & iceberg lettuce with spicy mambo dressing, it was disappointing. The salad was a bit soggy because it was over dressing. My suggestion is that NEVER order salad in the steak house. If you don't eat red meat or you are a vegetarian, but your friends throw party in the steak house then you are screwed!
The staffs were very nice thou and the lady with red hair at the ladies room service was super nice."}
{"text":"An excellent bar experience!  

I have eaten at Mastro's Ocean Club in Las Vegas on several occasions.  The food is always fresh, creative, exceptional and special.  

The atmosphere at Mastro's is open, airy, cool and is perched inside a funky tree house in the center of Crystals at City Center. 

But my most recent visit was to the bar for a drink with a friend having just seen Akhob by James Turrell at Louis Vuitton.  It was about 4:45PM on a Thursday.  The bar is not incredibly large, but is it welcoming, tasteful, upscale and classy.  Their drinks are priced in the $15-$21 range, but are really the essence of a great mixologists and high style.  The cocktail list is extensive.  The bartender was quick to have me taste a few things and explore my senses a bit.  

A solid bar experience!"}
{"text":"A good friend of ours suggested Mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the Strip. So I made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the Mastro's website. What I didn't know was that I had somehow clicked on the Chicago location. Luckily I was walking around the Crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. They were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :) 

The service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. Loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch. 

The food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi and the Signature Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. We had the bone-in Filet which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared Chilean Sea Bass which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned. 

Dessert was over the top .. we had three .. Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake, 
the Cherry Crisp, and the Profiteroles. The first two were topped with Vanilla Bean Gelato. Both were to die for. I had read lots about the Warm Butter Cake and it was everything I had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly I also loved the Cherry Crisp .. I am not huge on Cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the Crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the Gelato and fruitiness of the dish. It's something I would definitely order again! 

My only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the Beef Carpaccio appetizer. Mom and I each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. Being in the service industry myself, I would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the Carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it. 

All in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Best steak I've ever had. I had the Bone in filet cooked medium rare and it was so tender it just dissolved in my mouth. I also shared the lobster mashed potatoes and it was probably the best mashed potatoes i've ever had as well. It was super creamy and the lobster was cooked perfectly.

I came here w/ a group of 20 other guys for my friends bachelor party and we were given a private room w/ a tv so we could watch some football. Boys night out w/ steak, wine, and football? Cant beat that. The Bachelor kept saying this was way too fancy and it was all too much when he walked in the room. But one of our waiters told us \"This place is fancy...but you can act ghetto if you want. just relax and have a good time.\"

We had an excellent experience w/ even better food. This place is legit."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful and the ambiance is incredible.  The restaurant is in the Shops at Crystals, and in this very unique architectural element called the nest.  The food was wonderful, we had shrimp cocktail, steak, sides, and dessert.  I was here in the summer and I did not pack for formal wear that most nice restaurants in Vegas require, however, this restaurant is business casual.  I have a hard time wearing pants for anything in 112 degree weather...  It was also conveniently located near Aria, Mandarin Oriental, and Bellagio via tram."}
{"text":"This place time and time again will always be the best. It is the restaurant that I use to compare all other dining experiences I have. The Creme de la Creme!"}
{"text":"Best butter cake I've tried so far. This place is really good I think the food pictures are self explanatory. Only thing that sucks is they serve the food extremely hot so you can't eat it right away lol."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots for dinner. The lobster mashed potatoes are a must! Make reservations and take your date for a nice dinner. Definitely a quiet romantic spot for a dinner for two. They have a singer and piano player that make this place even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"The bad - made reservations at 9, didn't get seated until 10, paying $15 for a drink, it better be a damn good drink. Far from it. We are in Vegas there are plenty of options at here, so for not being in a club, i didn't want to pay $15 for a bad drink

I split the special - waygu steak bone in, it was a huge piece of meat, but for a $100 i truly didn't see why this was such an expensive piece of meat 

The good - the manger did come over due to us waiting an hour before we got seated and she brought over some Beef Carpaccio which was some of the best i have ever had.

The Ok - Lobster Mashed Potatoes, sounded better then they tasted.

I wouldn't recommend this place and i will not be coming back."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews on Mastro's, I was excited about having a high-end steakhouse experience. I was a little suspicious that their Yelp rating was so high since they were nowhere to be found on multiple lists of the best steakhouses in Vegas, but we needed a place that could accommodate a vegetarian, the Yelp rating was 4.5 with over 1000 reviews, and the decor looked inviting and unique. However, I wish I had listened to my gut and gone something else.

The service was incredibly slow and poor in quality. I had to ask twice about the location of our waitress after being seated for 5-10 minutes with no service. Each time, I was told she was \"on her way,\" and one server offered this same excuse even after our waitress finally showed up. It seemed like a standard line they were using rather than actually communicating with each other and coordinating adequate service. Furthermore, they serve the side dishes for you, which took an unfortunate turn when one of the servers missed the plate with our macaroni and cheese and decided that pulling the hot, cheesy mess over my wife's lap was a better idea than putting the spoon over the plate or returning the mac and cheese to its dish. 

Also, they heat their steak plates to over 400 degrees, a fact that they are quite proud of. In my opinion, a truly high-end restaurant shouldn't have a gimmick, let alone one that has no appreciable purpose. I really enjoyed not being able to adjust my plate on the table, in addition to having a personal space heater for the evening. /s

I like my steak medium rare, and I was warned that they tend to undercook their meats, but I ordered a medium rare NY strip anyways. Imagine my surprise when I received a steak that was medium at best (medium pink center with a few reddish juices) and too chargrilled on the outside to really appreciate the cut of meat (44 Farms). I've had better steak for the same price at restaurants back home. How is this considered a good experience in one of America's steakhouse meccas? My wife ordered the clam chowder and couldn't even bring herself to finish it. 

The sides weren't terrible, but I don't agree with the other reviewers about the lobster mashed potatoes. For $35 I expect to see more than 2 tiny pieces of lobster meat. They tasted fine but were nothing mind-blowing. For that price, there should have been at least a few whole chunks of lobster meat to enjoy. The twin lobster tails run twice the price on Mastro's menu; am I supposed to believe that the cost of potatoes is so much that they couldn't afford to include even half of a single lobster tail? The brussels sprouts were overcooked as well, with their charred exterior overwhelming any proper flavor.

The treehouse design of the restaurant is an interesting concept and looks cool in pictures, but in reality, you are floating over a shopping mall, and seeing/hearing shoppers meander about really detracts from any sense of class you hoped to have during your meal.  

Overall, I expected much more given the critical acclaim Yelp has for this place. The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stick to the big name steakhouses or at least those that worthy of a mention on Eater."}
{"text":"I found Mastro's on Yelp and didn't realize that it was the cool restaurant that looked like it was encased in a cocoon (now known as The Treehouse) when I shopped at the city center a couple of trips back.  I made reservations that day via Yelp and although we waited for about 15 minutes for our 9pm reservations, we were lucky enough to be seated in the Treehouse.  Very cool!  

I had the lobster bisque for a starter and the bowl was HUGE!  It filled me up quite a bit and from the mid point on, I wished I had it to share but managed to drink it all.  It was a bit rich so I was kind of done with it before I finished it off but didn't want to waste any of it so I was a trooper and drank it to the last drop.  Chilean sea bass seemed to be the popular recommendation so that's what I ordered for my entree and that was definitely delicious.  It's a good thing I didn't order any sides because those two dishes totally filled me up!

Great place to try and would recommend at least going there once.  It is a bit pricey but I think worth the experience. Next time I go back, I'd like to go back with a whole bunch of people to get their seafood tower.  The table next to us ordered that and it looked really cool.  If not for the food, just to take a picture to post online.  Haha!"}
{"text":"It's become a family tradition to dine at Mastro's Ocean Club every New Year's Eve. We're from Los Angeles but spend a lot of time at our home in Las Vegas and this location is by far the best location we've been to. The service is top notch and, of course, the food is absolutely delicious. Every. Single. Time. Highly recommend the vanilla battered shrimp and scallop appetizers. The bone in filet will ruin all other cuts of meat for you. The lobster mashed potatoes will change your life. The Butter Cake will clog your arteries and might send you into cardiac arrest, but hey, at least you will die happy. Silver linings."}
{"text":"I was just there last weekend for dinner hands-down the best lobster mashed potatoes I had that Waggy beef Tomahawk steak butter melts in your mouth I will recommend mastro's to anybody who loves steak the ambience nice just a great service great food and great people"}
{"text":"What's not to love? We dined here for Valentines Day and it was lovely. Wonderful service, extensive wine list and stiff drinks as my husband put it. I had the Chilean sea bass and my husband the ribeye. What I love is they offer 4 ways to prepare your fish which gives you more options when choosing a lighter dish. We spilt the enormous sides and didn't have any room left for desert (next time). We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Perfection.  I don't know if I could love Mastro's more. Seriously this place is so amazingly good. Love it, love it, love it.

So now that my mouth is watering I'll tell you why.

My boyfriend took me to Mastro's City Hall for my birthday last November so in return I took him to Ocean Club for his birthday. We were feeling more casual (too hot to dress up) so we sat in the bar where you can still get the full menu. The bar was lively with a piano player singing old favorites (Billy Joel, Van Morrison, etc.)

To start the evening off I ordered a Peartini. I was a little surprised at the price $18! But when our waitress brought out the drink with the shaker, $18 didn't seem so bad anymore. I got about 2.5 glassfulls and the drink was really strong. I certainly got my money's worth. Even after I stuffed myself I still felt tipsy. And the drink was really yummy.

On to the food. First thing they bring out is their bread basket. I could seriously just eat that for dinner and be happy. It includes these pretzel rolls that are to die for. SO good! It's worth going to Mastro's for the bread basket alone. No kidding.

The boyfriend loves bacon wrapped scallops. we saw they had scallops on the menu so we asked if they could wrap them in bacon. The waitress said she would ask and came back to say they would. Yay! So we got the appetizer size to share and they blew us away. One, they were huge, two they were served with this fantastic buttery sauce. They were cooked just right, they melted in our mouths.

Next we decided to split a filet and get a side of au gratin potatoes. The steak comes out on a sizzling plate and the potatoes were served in an iron skillet. The steak was great, cooked just right and full of flavor. The potatoes were drowning in cheddar cheese - almost too much but we're from the midwest where there really is no such this as too much cheese.

We were getting full but it was boyfriend's birthday so of course we had to order the butter cake. Wow. This cake is fantastic. We were expecting a slice of cake with butter cream frosting but instead we got a mini cake, kind of like a rum cake without the rum. On top was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it was surrounded by slices of oranges and strawberries. Oh, and it's served with a huge side of real whipped cream. No Reddi-whip here! This cake is out of this world. One of the best deserts anywhere.

On top of the great food we had a fantastic waitress. She was fun, helpful, didn't rush us, she did everything just right. A good waitress can add so much to the experience and she really helped make our evening special.

I can't wait until I can get back to Mastro's again. By far my favorite steak house in town."}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat - and people watch.  A bit pricey but worth it.  The staff is great and the drinks strong...what more could you want."}
{"text":"Frustrated with gluten free options. I have eaten here twice and frustrated both times. They do not have any gluten free bread, so you will have to watch the rest of your party eat a basket of bread as everyone decides on their appetizers. All of the appetizers are seafood and many gluten free options, but non satisfies an appetitive like bread. They brought me a very nice gluten free menu and I ordered a $140 steak which came with no seasoning and on a soggy plate. The under waiter came and put creamed corn on my plate (not gluten free). I asked for another plate and they brought me a cold plate, which made the soggy steak cold. Scalloped potatoes and sautéed broccoli were perfect, five star. For dessert I had the chocolate sin cake. It was amazing and best gluten free chocolate cake I have ever had. So, don't arrive here hungry if you are gluten free, expect an unseasoned bland soggy steak. Side dishes and dessert were perfect."}
{"text":"Mastro's is one of my favorite restaurants in town. The menu is wonderful and this is a restaurant where every single dish is perfection. The foie gras is an orgasm in your mouth - yes, that's a thing. Rarely happens, but when it does....
The filet is one of my favorite steaks in this city. I judge a restaurant harshly on their bread service. If you're 5 stars you had better have amazing bread & butter, Mastro's does :). A restaurant should pay attention to every detail!
Plus, the restaurant is in a treehouse, which makes for such a fun but elegant setting. Decor & service on point. They're making me a fort for my next visit - a promise is a promise. 
Yup. Acing the dining experience Mastro's. I rarely give 5 stars because to me it equals perfection in every way."}
{"text":"We usually try to make it to Maestros when we are in Scottsdale. It is pricey but oh so delicious. We like to sit in the bar area to hear the live music and watch the people. We started off with oysters in the half shell. The blue point bay oysters were delicious. They serve a variety of breads in a basket, my hands down favorite is the pretzel bread. Be careful, if you eat too many you won't enjoy your dinner. The roasted Brussel sprouts were served sizzling in a saucepan that was put under the broiler for a minute to get that light char flavor. I had the seared ahi sashimi which was served in a light teriyaki type glaze. Although it was a large serving it was a little salty due to the Cajun rub. My husband had the Chilian Sea Bass which was fresh and baked to perfection with a golden crust.  He said it was the best fish he has ever had. The peachtini was a generous 2 glass serving at $18 and delicious served in a chilled glass with a twist of orange. Overall a wonderful dinner with excellent seafood."}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner and all i can say is WoW. First, the service is outstanding. Second the Petite Filet was so well prepared you did not even need a knife. The flavor was amazing, as were the sides we order. You definitely get what you pay for here..worth every penny"}
{"text":"Come here for the seafood!! We got the shrimp cocktail and the oysters to share and I cannot stop thinking about the gigantic shrimp! Fresh, juicy, and the size of a mini lobster! The Kumato oysters were fresh, but sandy. I wish we would have tried the crab or lobster instead. 
The steak was good, but had parts that were more heavily seasoned than others. It was still tasty, but I felt Ruth's Chris does a better steak. The mac and cheese was mediocre and could be skipped next time. The asparagus was fresh, but the tips weren't cooked. I did like that they serve the sides for you.
The berry dream cocktail was to die for! It was strong, but didn't have the strong alcohol taste and the server shakes it up table side and leaves you the remains in the shaker. Definite plus!
For dessert, they brought out the chocolate cake for our anniversary celebration. It was overly sweet and a bit dry. I really wanted to try the butter cake so we ordered one of those too. Very decadent and delicious. I enjoyed the slightly crisp edges and soft, warm center with the ice cream. 
Overall, this was a good experience. We would come back the next time and try more of the seafood."}
{"text":"Came here to eat dinner with a couple of out of town friends.  We were greeted nicely and led to our table.  

Given menus and told about the menu options and some of the favorites.  We were also told about the side items (made in large portions meant to be family style) And about the salads (also large and meant for 2 people).  our salads came quickly and cleared as soon as we finished and the entrees and side came soon after.

The service and knowledge is top notch, the food is good and the fish is flown in daily.

Good food good service pricing not bad, will come back!"}
{"text":"Let's begin with, this location is in the middle of a mall.. which alot of other reviewers have brought up i know - but it's the main reason for 4 stars instead of 5. It does get a bit loud and the view is of a shopping mall.. a high-end shopping mall, but still. Not my ideal view for a such an awesome spot. It is what it is though!

The room itself is very nice, lots of seating, lively atmosphere, great looking staff. I have been a couple of times now and the service is always great when I have gone and the food spectacular. 

I have ben to Ocean Club a couple of times, but this most recent visit was a dinner of 'Dungeoness Crab Cocktail', 'Ribeye' and '10 oz Ahi Sashimi' . We shared everything with a side of sauteed spinach .. and a few martinis. :) I loved was the personal style serving from the individual pans that the food items were seemingly prepared in. The service staff has always been very pleasant and makes the experience very comfortable. 

The Ahi was fantastic with a really beautiful presentation laid out on a long plate with a finish of a really tasty sauce. The ribeye was prepared expertly, perfect medium rare with still  a beautiful grill flavor. The spinach was .. spinach, sauteed.. but was excellent nonetheless! haha.. I was having such a great time and enjoying the vibe of the place overall. 

There was a piano player in the corner of the room playing standards and old-school vegas tunes.. Sinatra and the like. It gave a beautiful feel to an elegant style dinner. My friends and I aren't the most refined diners, but we know how to have a good time, and Maestro's made us feel welcome within that setting.

Now don't get me wrong... this ain't your downtown steakhouse with a $4.99 steak special.. you WILL drop a pretty penny to have some seriously tasty grub.. but I do believe it's worth it.  At over $150 a head when we dined there last, it was worth the money but definitely be ready for a big bill. It's nearly unavoidable. 

Have a great time, and happy eating!"}
{"text":"Jae wore a tank top and they still let him in. The sides were just okay. Gnocchi was the best side we had. Lobster mash potato, asparagus, Mack n cheese, and spinach. We ordered three different steaks and split it for the table medium rare. I like rare medium rare and my restaurant to have a dimmer light."}
{"text":"18 oz bone-in filet was the best and priciest piece of steak I had so far.  

Lobster mashed potatoes were good.  The portion was huge.  It can probably feed 3 to 4 people."}
{"text":"A great bet for a solid meal and good service in Vegas. Our meal was delicious and our server was very friendly and attentive. Eating in the \"nest\" was neat although it is kinda funny it's the middle of a mall. Would recommend for a good dinner in Vegas."}
{"text":"Management has yet to contact me a week later. This shows how much management cares about their loyal patrons who have dined here many times.  We will take our business over to Eddie Vs where they treat with you with dignity and respect!!  Shame on you management for not reaching out via email or phone!!!  1 star all around"}
{"text":"Truly amazing food. My wife and I had the opportunity to dine there this last weekend. Service was excellent as well as the food. Its worth every penny! highly recommend to all!"}
{"text":"I brought clients here on a Thursday evening for dinner around 800 pm. I recommend reservations since  the place gets busy. My clients who arrived from Denver around a year ago and never experienced Mastro's previously so I knew they were in for a treat.

We started off with drinks at the table  once we were  seated and were brought the awesome bread basket -  I indulged in the pretzel bread yum! We ordered a few appetizers - scallops, crab cakes and ordered our starter salads. I opted for just the 1/2 salad of the iceberg wedge - it's plenty large and so yummy. For my main entree I went for he rack of lamb and we shared several twice cooked potatoes and cream spinach. Everything was spectacular and the service was stellar! My lamb was cooked to perfection and  my clients were impressed as I expected. The only con was nobody had room for buttercake!

I received a telephone call from Mastrro's the following day thanking me for my business which again is so out of the box. I'm happy to see even with the change of ownership that nothing has changed here!"}
{"text":"My family & I came here to have a celebratory meal, and this place did not disappoint! We had a reservation but arrived early, and we were seated right away. We had an excellent waiter who was very informative and friendly. The bread basket arrived, and it had a huge assortment of flavors in there -- pretzel bread, garlic cheese crisps, etc. Just amazing! Between the 3 of us, we ordered 2 cuts of fish, a steak, and 2 sides. They first gave us each sizzling hot plates with some oil on it for eating off of. Nice presentation. The sides are served family style and are meant to be shared. We opted for the creamed corn and steamed asparagus. Both were delicious and cooked to perfection! We had a petit filet, and they had sliced it up for us to share. It was perfectly pink in the center. Their fish is served very simply, with just the cut of fish for presentation, no add-ons. We had their signature Chilean Sea Bass and Alaskan Halibut. Our server said each fish dish can be served 5 different ways (grilled, pan-seared, etc.), but he recommended that for white fish, it be cooked method #5. Can't recall exactly but it involves some herbs and seasoning. Both the sea bass and the halibut were cooked that way, and they came out scrumptious! They had sliced each piece 3 ways for easy sharing for us, which was very nice. And to round off the meal, we had checked-in on yelp so got a free warm butter cake for dessert! It's normally worth $15! I highly recommend this restaurant for fine dining!"}
{"text":"Ocean Club is a great place to impress a date (hint, hint). The atmosphere is great, service is fantastic and the food is good. 

The atmosphere and service surpasses the food.  They serve a great basked of bread, but for me, they can skip everything but the pretzel bread. #addicted.

I had a tasty dirty martini, made to perfection.  For food, we started with the Seafood Tower. We picked crab, lobster and a few others.  That was where we could have stopped and been full but didn't.  I had a petite cut and it was cooked to perfection. 

Top shelf experience and good atmosphere for a date night."}
{"text":"Beautiful location in one of the high end malls in the new City Center. Little bit hard to find if you don't normally shop here. And I don't. Civil servant salary :(. But we made it and we made reservations in advance so no problems with our table. 

Once placed at a table I think the floormanager thought it took too long before we got menu's and drinks because after some talking in a little microphone he brought the menu's himself. And bizarre: he really, really resembles Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang Theory). And once you've seen it........

Our waiter showed up explaining the menu and taking the drink orders. To be honoust, we've missed most of the information. A high speed talk with way too much information about the specials.

We decided on half a portion of the salad of the day (spinach, bacon, egg, the promised blue cheese was hard to find), the lobster bisque, a Ahi Tuna Tartare and the Ribeye with bone. For sides just the sauteed mushrooms.

Portions are huge, but had a few dissapointments considering the price. Although we'resure the waitress spoke off different kinds of Preparing the meat (grilled, blackend, etc.) she didn't asked we would like the meat prepared. Looking at the meat of our neigbours we asked which cooking that was. Turned out to be rare. Just a little too pink for us so we asked the meat to be cooked medium. Can tell you, what we got was definitely way beyond medium. Almost welldone. And no,we didn't send it back. I know, we should have.

The mushrooms were perfectly cooked and huge. Like the portion. More than enough to satisfy four. The bisque was oke but both appetizers, the spinach salad and Ahi Tuna Tartare were flat. The salad being nothing special and the Tuna was way to cold  discover any taste at all. I also don't understand the fried things (onions?) on the bottom.

Best experiences were the setting, despite the location, the services and the bread. Especially the latter was excellent. 

Together with a glass of white and red we've paid $163 before tip.

NOTE: excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. I'm no native speaker and keep having troubles with my Apple device that keeps trying to change the English words into proper Dutch words. Yes, you've guessed right. My first language."}
{"text":"Overpriced, way under seasoned (the mussels and garlic mashed had no salt or unique flavor whatsoever) and the service was incredibly slow. For a $120 meal for two I expected a lot more"}
{"text":"The food is great and the service was excellent. We complained the lobster pasta didn't hve enough lobster and they immediately changed it and it was AMAZING"}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. The location is weird to me. If you're all about s calm and tranquil atmosphere when you eat.....this is not the place. Service is super fast and super efficient. The kind of service I want when I go to Denny's. Not when I'm trying to enjoy a nice dinner. Like I said efficient but very rushed but I guess that is to be expected in Las Vegas! We split a filet and two lobster tails, sautéed asparagus and mushrooms, I had a bowl of lobster bisque. Asparagus was whatever, mushrooms were tasty, steak was perfect , lobster was too salty and not really fresh. Same with the bisque, it had a slight fishy odor. Lots of lobster and the flavor was good just not FRESH. Again, it's the desert so what did I expect? This was my first Mastro's experience, and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't too impressed. Satisfied. I would try the Beverly Hills location, but not again in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent everything! The prawns were amazing as was Mastro's mustard sauce.  Highly recommend the seabass and filet."}
{"text":"Been going here for years to people watch and have drinks...past three times I have ate there and wasnt impressed. The seabass is extreamly fishy and last night I ordered the Mahi Mahi...it was dark and tasted like chicken.  I had to fill up on pretzel bread because waiter didnt come back for 30mins after serving the food :("}
{"text":"Wow....If it wasn't a bit spendy I'd love to go here more often when in Las Vegas!

Great bar staff with amazing drinks.... Although the martini's are a bit expensive, they give you the shaker w/ the leftover which makes it almost two martini's... And they are awesome...

We also had a great bottle of wine from their nice selection to choose from.

And the food!!! Wow, the steaks are amazing and we also had a shrimp and a crab cocktail appetizer that were to die for. Nice atmosphere - a little dressy, but it is Vegas so you can show up casual.

We had several great bartenders since we sat at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed it.

Great spot in central location on the strip....."}
{"text":"Mastro's is absolutely by far the best fine dining you will find in the US. I have been to all locations except for Chicago. (Yes, I will get there someday.) It is expensive but worth every penny. The crab cakes are crazy delicious. Lobster mashed potatoes. Yeah, you read that correctly. The filet melts in my mouth. The chocolate covered strawberries are amazing even when ordered in the dead of winter! I'm heading there in a few weeks for my 40th birthday followed by Thunder from Down Under. Ahhh, what a fabulous evening that shall be."}
{"text":"Look, it's Mastro's, we all know that it's expensive going in but when you want good oysters you don't want to skimp.

We ordered a dozen assorted that were on special.  4 kumamotos, 4 fanny bay and 4 blue points.

Of the 6 oysters I ate, only 1 was good.  The others were fishy and mealy.  Just not fresh.  Very disappointing for the price.

2 stars for the very nice and accommodating bar tender."}
{"text":"Food was off the charts but our waitress was awful. Amending review.  Let me explain, first of all the restaurant is very nice.  We waited in the bar for our table with a glass of wine.  When we sat down, a fabulous, wonderful happy woman came over to talk to us about wine, some menu items.  We asked if she could be our server and she explained no.  Too bad!!!  After a long wait our waitress came over to take drink order.  She was so blah and it took forever to get.  No mention of appetizers no suggestions, no enthusiasm.   First time here for 2 of us, what are u known for?  The table next door was getting the service of a lifetime from their waiter, by the way.    Food came out very hot and absolutely fantastic.  Had coupon for dessert, waitress would not take ( after spending 450 on dinner) then came back to say she would.  Too late.  My daughter loves this place and was treating parents to dinner first time at ocean club.  Maybe my expectations are too high.  Just disappointed that my daughter spent a lot of money for average."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised right now. So if you read my other reviews you pretty much know that it's hard to get 5 stars, but pretty easy to get 4 stars. If you get 3 stars then there must've been something wrong. 
First of all I was really into going to eat here. I thought it was really nice on the inside. I had a very positive attitude without super high expectations. That's the ideal right? 
Well, I was here for my wife's birthday, and my sister in laws belated birthday dinner. I ordered bone in rib eye. My wife ordered bone in filet w lobster tail on the side and my sister in law ordered lamb chops. I ordered mine medium rare. It came out just under well done. My wife ordered hers medium and it came out well done. My sister ordered hers medium and it came out rare. The manager happened to come by and ask how everything was. I really want to avoid complaining at a restaurant, but my wife said his is too done, and my sisters is not done enough. I said hey it's alright we can handle it, but the manager said oh no please let me take care of this. Ok I said no problem thank you so much. So they started another steak for me and started to cook my sisters more. Ok so they brought mine back. It looked right on the outside...nice looking. Alright so it was practically raw. My sisters comes back and it looks like they threw it in the microwave. All the while it's my wife's birthday and her steak is brown. Wtf. 
So I cook a little around the house. Some say my steak is better than most restaurants. I usually say it's ok. Well, in this case I can say I can get the temp on the money 90% of the time without timing it. I really was kind of shocked. I won't go into the meat anymore because it really was a train wreck. 
The appetizers were good. Dungeness crab cocktail, and oysters on a half shell. Drinks were great. We all enjoyed. But the dinner was really one of the worst I have ever had. I am really bummed about that. I can't really rate it a 1 star because the manager was good, appetizers were good, drinks were good, but the dinner...well, never again. I almost want to bump up the 2 stars that I have given on other reviews because this review is really 1 and a half."}
{"text":"My mom and I came to this restaurant because we got a gift card to the shops at Crystals. I got the filet mignon and my mother got sushi. The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the sushi was excellent. The sushi dish actually came with quite a large amount of sushi. The bread basket was pretty nice also. We also got the asparagus and the mashed potatoes. We actually had a miscommunication with our very very knowledgable waitress and wanted lobster mashed potatoes instead. The manager came up to us and without hesitation brought us a lobster mashed potatoes literally within 3 minutes. The lobster mashed potatoes were also great. For dessert we had the butter cake and it was to die for. I'm not usually a cake person, but this was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Highly recommended - great service, great food. The price tag of the meal is quite high however; with all of our food the total was still about $100 even with a $100 gift card."}
{"text":"OH wow how could I forget to make a review for this place?! LONG overdue this review is for March.... I was celebrating my 21st birthday you know in LAS VEGAS duh! Hahaha, my boyfriend made reservation for my birthday dinner on a Sunday night this was last minute because we wanted to stay in Vegas longer hahaha , we usually go to the one in Orange County because we are from California. 

OH wow this Mastros is GORGEOUS! Make sure to ask for a seat in the bird-nest!! 

Food - BEST BEST BEST Lamb racks ever!!! Ugh I had it medium rare but it came out more rare but I didn't mind. Ever bite taste like butter. Boy friend has the New York Steak - This wasn't so bad, I couldn't stop thinking about how good my lamb racks were that I can't remember if this was super good or not hahaha. We had a side of Mac and Cheese too greasy, would not order this I think we prefer the Lobster Mash potatoes instead. 

Service was wonderful! Better service than we had in Orange County. Everyone was nice, and even the manager came to ask if everything was fine. 

In the end of the meal our server ask if we wanted any dessert but we were super full for any. But he still came out and surprise me with a birthday cake! He even wrote \" Happy 21st birthday. \" Which I think is very special to me!  

THANK YOU MASTRO'S LAS VEGAS!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience! The wait staff were so attentive, and the food was fantastic. The restaurant itself looks very nice and upscale. There's not much else to say because it was such a perfect dinner. I wish I knew the name of my waiter, so I could mention him. He was wonderful though. I'm sure they all are:)"}
{"text":"Restaurant is built like a tree house in the middle of the shopping area in the Aria casino.   Very cool concept and views over looking the casino.  The hostess was very nice and recommended a table for us right by the window in the tree house.  The waiter was very polite and super friendly. Besides recommending some of the meals, he had some personal conversations with us and it turned out that he is not too far from where I live.   Now to the important part..... For appetizer we had escargot, which was really good.  For main entree we ordered a lobster special that was recommended by the waiter and the lamb chops.  Both entrees were very tasty and made just right.  Some of the best meals ive ever had.  For dessert we ordered cherry pie which was really good, but very large, we had maybe a 3rd between the 2 of us.  If you get dessert, i recommend you split it. As a matter of fact, both entrees were very generous sizes and we couldn't finish it all.
I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. The food, the service and the atmosphere are fantastic."}
{"text":"Steak....great!  Seared Ahi Tuna.....great!  Ahi tosatas......great!  Brussels Sprouts....meh!  Butter Cake.....had to change my pants!!!!  Service was phenomenal!!!!!!!!!

Pants.....ruined."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better than this.  Anytime I have out if town visitors that want a great meal we go to Ocean Club.  This place is what all great restaurants should be like."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great food and drinks.  Wish they had a location in San Jose or San Francisco."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to have a celebratory dinner. There was a bit of a mix up with our reservations (I used open table) but they were still able to accomodate us.

Mastro's is located inside the Shops at Crystals on the second floor. My boyfriend loved his Hennessy sidecar cocktail and always talks about going back just for drinks and to try their dessert.

We decided to skip appetizers and just go straight into the main course. We got the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye, the ahi tuna sashimi, lobster mashed potatoes, and sauteed broccoli. Since we were sharing, they offered to plate and serve everything for us. We ordered with the intention that the tuna would be for me, and the steak would be for him but by the end of the meal, I enjoyed the steak so much I ended up eating most of it. I'm a fan of ribeye steaks because i find them to be more flavorful than filets - and the steak here had a nice sear on the outside and perfectly tendor on the inside. The lobster mashed potatoes were yummy but a little bit salty to me (although my boyfriend said it was fine and he loved it). The amount that we ordered was more than enough for two people, we didn't get to dessert because we were so stuffed."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was nothing special. I expected better, especially for that price..."}
{"text":"You know, some close friends of mine introduced me to this place a few years ago. I've yet to find it's equal. 

I highly recommend the Flour de blu (stoli elit), butter cake, Chilean sea bass, and anything else you can wrap your paws around. Truly epic."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at Mastro's. We had a table of 20 people and we all order different items and loved them all immensely. I got crab claws and my husband got steak. We also ordered the bacon appetizer as well as the vanilla shrimp. I truly think I'm addicted to the vanilla shrimp. It is unbelievable and so flavorful. The salads and all of the sides are amazing but I have to tell you that their signature dessert (which is a warm butter cake) is the best dessert you will ever eat. My girls got chocolate covered strawberries with the mound of whip cream and those two were extraordinary. Go eat at this restaurant because you will love it!"}
{"text":"The Red Dragonfire drink is oh sooooo delicious.  A smooth martini with a hint of spice. Also try the butter cake. This cake literally melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"We went to Mastros City Hall last year.
This year we came down for spring training and always that one great meal.
This year we tried Mastros Ocean Club.
We were not disappointed.
The food was amazing.
I had salmon that was cooked to perfection.
6 of us shared 3 side dishes and it was more than enough.
Our service was lead by Dave and he like the food did not disappoint.
We are fans and we will be back next year during our annual trip to Arizona.

Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and food. The seafood tower was fresh and delicious. I had the bone in filet, halibut, along with multiple sides. Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"I am going to be 100% and not waste anyone's time.

Butter cake. Best I have ever had. So sweet buttery, that homemade whip cream adds a nice sugary surprise. That is all I get when I go here and totally worth it.

THE VERDICT: Butter Cake. See YA!"}
{"text":"Loses a star because there were 15 empty tables when we walked in at 9:25 for our 9:15 reservation, and they made us wait at the bar for 15 minutes. 

Otherwise, basically a great meal. Slightly poor ambiance because it's in a mall, albeit an ultra fancy mall. The piano guy was pretty good. 

The food was fantastic. Had really good oysters, ask for the grassy ones if they have them. Some sort of california oyster that had a really strong flavor that the waitress recommended. 

The crab cakes and ahi tuna apps were also very good.

For main we got the seabass and the swordfish. The seabass was very good, but not in that cliched and too common sweet glazed seabass/ black cod. 

Swordfish I foolishly ordered a little underdone but was still good. They allow you to choose how to cook the meat, if you don't know much about cooking and different fish, ask the server, he/she seems very likely to know the best way to order each fish. 

For dessert, we got their signature \"butter cake\" which was obviously ridiculously rich and good. Served with an ENORMOUS tray of whipped cream. Everything at this restaurant appears to be made from scratch, and it tastes that way too. Every dish is enormously portioned as well."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants, this location in particular is fantabulous!  The food is always mouth watering, the service and staff are superb from the moment you walk in everything is nothing short of excellent.  My husband and I make it a point to dine here when we are in town, it never disappoints.  Our servers Tanya and Juan were AMAZING and made our dining experience superior this past visit!  They made us feel like we were the only table in the restaurant :)  I would highly recommend everyone dine here and of course order the butter cake."}
{"text":"We were there on Sat evening pre valentines thought we would try it again after a not so good experience a while ago! I ordered  Mahi it was raw inside!!! Ewe!! Sent it back strange for such a high dollar eatery!!! The service not so great either 2 chances their out! on to Dominicks or City hall next time"}
{"text":"The crab legs and lobster tail are to die for.  The food was terrific, the service could have been better.  The staff seemed extremely stressed out, but other than that, wonderful food, beautiful building in a great location.  We walked around the complex after dinner, the shops and the scenery in the Kierland complex in Scottsdale are very beautiful."}
{"text":"Was brought here on my birthday and I was blown away. From decor, to food, to service... Everything was top notch. I had the blackened salmon, which was perfect. All my guests also enjoyed their meals, and we had a great time. Will definately be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner at tonight with my man. Lobster dinner and he had the lamb chops it was unreal and our server was fantastic will definitely come back here what a great evening"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Our waitress was top notch. Pretzel bread and mashed potatoes were excellent. Huge steaks. Noise level was a little loud. Would recommend for a special night out."}
{"text":"This Vegas Mastros location is my absolute favorite compared to the Bev Hills and Malibu one. 
I guess i just like the more airy, modern vibe there. The BH location is kind of old and stuffy, while the Malibu one is cramped and the vibe is weird.
The energy felt so much more free flowing and airy at this vegas location. I'm assuming because it's much newer. But I love it. The other ones seemed to cramp the tables too close together.
As far as the food...amazing. The foie gras was delicious and the portions were generous , seafood platter...yum! The steak was perfect.
Thank you Mastros for another yummy experience!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 4.5 stars.

The bone-in rib eye was not as impressive as I had expected. There wasn't as much marbling, and it didn't seem seasoned enough. 

The truffle gnocchi = out of this world. This is a def must-try.
The lobster mashed potatoes- SUPER legit. But I think my cholesterol level shot up double points from the butter. It was swimming in yellow soup-ey juice, and when I asked the waiter, \"Excuse me, is that butter.\" He responded, \"Most people think it's a sauce. But yes, that is butter.\"  I like how he didn't give me a straight answer first. It sure looked like some sauce!

Bread basket- LOVE. 
Seafood appetizer- much more filling than expected. 

Interesting layout and concept of being in a mall. It's a place worth trying out for a nice occasion."}
{"text":"Famous for their seafood, famous for their seafood. Between the salmon, swordfish, steak and chicken I tried last night, the seafood won. Steak was decent, but for the price you can get better elsewhere. 
The sides: mashed potatoes, creamed spinach, green beans. All great, but really nothing that stood out. 
Mastro's is the weird treehouse looking restaurant inside City Center. They have free valet service if you're dining here. Just make sure you park at the right place- NOT Aria, NOT Vdara parking."}
{"text":"Simply incredible dining experience. Would have liked to have been greeted sooner once we were sat; but, other than that, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Nice place for dinner.  Lots of choices on the menu.  It's just as good as the Mastro's that is focused on steaks.
For this group dinner, we had:
Jalapeno Tuna Sashimi - excellent, and not that spicy even w the jalapenos
Hamachi w crispy onions - excellent, especially with the crispy onions
Heirloom tomatoes - ok, but I would pass on this
Sea Bass - very good, but not spectacular
Vanilla battered sole - very good w massive portion (4 large pieces) and yummy tartar sauce
Lobster mashed potatoes - outstanding and one order enough for 4-5 people easily
Gorgonzola mac n cheese - nice and cheesy (nuff said)
Roasted Brussels sprouts - excellent

Yes, i would come back here!"}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced....mash potatoes taste like they are out of a box. Ahi tuna is great but again very over priced. Don't understand why people rave about it.  Restaurants should be based on quality of food versus \"trendy\"."}
{"text":"Since Landry's bought out Mastro's , I have noticed they have really cut back on how much they serve in their Martini drinks which is disappointing. They also cut back on their filets too. The service is great, it's a good thing they kept their staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great looking restaurant. Servers were extremely attentive and friendly. Overall, great restaurant. Would definitely go again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 8:30 only got sat at 9:15 but the managers said they will take care of us. Hopefully they keep their word. The service is always very well done with multiple servers/busers/backserver anywhere you look. The 8 oz filet was cooked very well to the choice of selection. The sweet potato fries were good but didn't look very appealing. The cream of corn was to die for. The sautéed mushrooms had a nice grill flavor. I would like to come back if there were no \"speed bumps\" with the reservations. Turns out there was nothing done to the tab like the managers offered. Really disappointed they didn't meet the needs of the customer."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a bachelorette party for one of my besties and decided on this place for our fancy dinner night. We had 11 girls and people ordered a variety of things from the sea bass to the bone-in steaks. This is one of those fancy places where you order just the protein and then sides are extra. Here's the breakdown:

Bread basket - GOOD. Normally, I'm not a fan of loading up on carbs, but we were getting bottle service the night and I was already starving, so I had to put something in the stomach. I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the bread! So soft and slightly warmed.

Lobster bisque - giant serving (probably enough for 2!). Rich and creamy with actual chunks of lobster!

Seabass - good and buttery. It was a big serving size and I only finished probably half of it.

Bone-in ribeye - good, but slightly under cooked according to my friend's order.

Lobster mashed potatoes - I'm not really a fan of mashed potatoes and these were okay. Small pieces of lobster mixed in.

Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries - pretty good! Nice little break between bites of our main courses.

Creamed corn - pretty good! Nice side dish without being overpowering.

The food was pretty good, but for a place of this caliber, I expected a lot more. They either under cooked or over cooked several steak orders, which had me thinking: What kind of steak house is this?!

The service was top notch at least and our bride-to-be got a special warm butter cake delivered to our table.

Would I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"Now THAT is what I call Fine Dining!!! I was simply WOW'D by the absolutely impeccable service and presentation!! Every other fine dining restaurant in Vegas should emulate EVERYTHING that Mastro's does but they won't so Mastro's shall remain the BEST.

I took my 74 year old mom there for her birthday after reading the glowing reviews and she was in tears over how AMAZING her experience was!  They cater to your every need and anticipate them which is what I look for. Never an empty water glass, dishes cleared immediately, food kept coming!  

And the fooooddd!!!
Appetizer: Mom: Calamari Me: Lobster Bisque=  OH YEAH!

Entree: Mom: Scallops Me: Chilean Sea Bass= Woah Nelly!!!

Sides: Scalloped potatoes,  creamed Spinach,  and those French fries= To die for!

Dessert: Their world renowned BUTTER CAKE!  They wrote \"Happy Birthday\" to my mom in chocolate and gave us this CRAZE AMAZE homemade whipped cream.  We were both so stuffed by then that we couldn't eat that much of the cake but next time I'm not eating for a week before I go!!  

Overall,  my mom and I are still both in complete awe over our dining odysey at Mastro's.  I've lived in Vegas for over 17 years and it's actually pretty rare to get service like that here.  There's good service  and then there's MASTRO'S SERVICE!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Mastros my bf got a filet mignon with bone I think, and I got the Chilean bass, with a side of mashed potatoes, it was delicious!!!! Plus instead of getting just a glass of wine for $12, we got a bottle $36 instead. Service was great, no complaints. We also got a complimentary huge piece of chocolate cake for our anniversary (it was amazing). The only \"but\" I have, was their bread was cold and hard, not fresh. Other than that everything was great!"}
{"text":"I have been here once, I have not one thing to complain about! The food was delicious, hot, and cooked well. Servers were so friendly, and willing to explain everything on the menu. everything is so over priced, but the atmosphere and amazing, its inside the Aria Hotel, cant complain would go back!"}
{"text":"My son has just chided me for never writing a good review. So that I become more credible, let me state that the dinner I had last night at the Ocean Club was fantastic.

My waiter, Michael was very entertaining and attentive. 

The tuna tartare appetizer was very large and it was very high quality.

The Boston chowder was good, i take off a point for too much bacon and not enough clams.

The Mediterranean Bronzino was perfectly prepared and totally delicious.

I tried some of their famous butter cake, it was as a good of a desert that I have ever tried, just too full to eat much of it.

If you are in Scottsdale, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, and although they were absolutely packed, the service was excellent. I ordered the Ribeye, and the first time around this particular slab was tough and stringy. I started to tell our server and he grabbed the steak no questions asked without even letting me finish my sentence..Could it have been that I tried my brother's Kobe beef steak prior to trying the ribeye, which set up unrealistic expectations? Possibly....but they brought out another ribeye fresh off the grill, which was nice, tender, and perfect. For desert, we had the warm buttercake, which was phenomenal. Also add some drinks into the equation, and for three of us, our bill was $385. I think it was worth it, though."}
{"text":"I used to always walk by this place during undergrad thinking... \"Man will i ever make enough to be able to eat at this place?\" I still don't but pulled the trigger one night before watching the game of thrones concert. Call it an off night which i'm sure it definitely was because I really wasn't all that impressed with the service or the food.

***Since this is a $$$$ restaurant, i'm gonna be much more critical so please don't think i'm being pompous***

Service: A beautiful wood hive embodies the restaurant as its worker bees hustle to make amazing food with beyond satisfactory service is the impression at first glance but upon being seated my plate had a long strand of hair waiting for me. Waiter was prompted and merely switched it out without any real apologetic notion. \"ohh oops... is this your first time here?\" I expected more of \"My dear this is absolutely unacceptable, please excuse this avoidable mistake.\" Our server was a middle aged man with what sounded like a scottish accent seemed a bit perplexed maybe it was his first few shifts working here but didn't represent the valor of \"Mastros\" that I have heard so much about. The wait staff was efficient in clearing plates and refilling our waters. I ordered my rack of lamb medium rare and it came out quite rare. The server was accommodating to take the piece back to have it more evenly cooked. 

Food: Calamari was pretty standard compared to other calamari I have had at other restaurant. The Lobster bisque was definitely the highlight of the night, Full pieces of lobster claw and meat in my soup that was genuine since I was interrupted by a piece of shell in my mouth as I was enjoying this otherwise wonderful soup. Garlic mashed potatoes was standard and the gorgonzola mac & cheese was good but a bit thick with al dente macaroni. I was hoping for mac & cheese more on the soft buttery cheesy side but the cheese was quite solidified. Rack of lamb was excellent but make sure you order it medium and no more rarer than this. By the end of the meal we were too full to get dessert which I know they are famous for but at this point I wasn't to impressed with dinner. 

Overall: I really can't say if i'll give this place a chance. I'm not big into fancy restaurants unless the occasion calls for it and the next special night I have i'll probably end up going to one of my favorite spots in Vegas, Echo and Rig."}
{"text":"vanilla batter shrimp appetizer - good but i was expecting more than 3 shrimp for $20
bone in ribeye - good, i thought Barrymore ribeye was clearly better (and cheaper)
lobster tail - best lobster I've had, really good
broccoli side dish - this is just steamed broccoli, nothing special.  Unless you are obsessed with broccoli I suggest spending your $10 and a different side.  

Looking at other reviews it looks like I should have ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and warm butter cake  instead of the shrimp and broccoli.

Also while this is clearly a classy place, its also an open view restaurant where you are exposed to people walking by in the surrounding mall and there is not much space between you and other diners.  This gives off a somewhat casual flair to this place for guests expecting a more intimate and special occasion."}
{"text":"Definitely not impressed. Read several reviews online before deciding that this would be where my husband and I would have dinner on our last night in Vegas. The only good things about my experience were the bread basket and the scallops appetizer. I had a petite filet and was not impressed. I ate maybe half of it. I would have thought that when our server saw that I had stopped eating that he would have asked if everything is ok. I did not want to complain so I didn't say anything and that is where I messed up. A manager stopped by and asked how everything was and that was after maybe 1-2 bites before I realized exactly how poor my steak was. I always order a filet when I go out for a nice meal and now I am wishing that I had just ordered the appetizer instead of wasting money on eating half of a meal. I am now back in my hotel room trying to figure out if I should try to go somewhere else to salvage my night and have something to eat. I will add that my husband had the ahi tuna sashimi and it was a very large portion and he enjoyed his meal. We ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and didn't even finish half of them, they were definitely nothing spectacular. There are way better dining options, so be careful what you order and if you don't like it then say something, unlike myself who is now out $125 for a mediocre dinner."}
{"text":"Love, love, love, love, this place. It can be a bit busy and stuffy at times, but none of that matters.

The pretzel bread is hot and ready to shove into my mouth, the drinks and wine selections are on the level with any other steak house...and the steaks are excellent...however...what separates this place from the others are the sides and the completely unassuming desert.

I have frequented this location and also the one in Vegas at the crystals mall (Aria) quite a bit. Both are excellent and consistent and service is second to none, absolute first class staff. 

Back to the important part, the sides. You MUST get the lobster mashed potatoes. It isnt a question or recommendation, you MUST get them. I don't care if you have to continuously shoot yourself in the neck with an eppie pen or run a drip IV to eat it, you come here, you eat it, you leave happy. 

As with any first class establishment, they'll pretty much make you anything you want, as we recently discovered at the Vegas location, they will make you Lobster mac and cheese...hell, they'd probably even put it in the waiters shoes, put a bib on you and spoon feed you if that's what it took to keep you happy. I haven't tested that theory yet, but, I imagine stranger requests have been made at the Vegas location.

Now on to dessert. Oh shit. There is nothing in life that could ever prepare you for the decadence of what I am going to say next. Butter Cake. It sounds like some kind of slurr, like everything was great butt'er cake. But I am fucking dead serious. You eat here, you order the butter cake, and you will never look at dessert the same way again. They bring that bad mother fucker out with a huge helping of freshly made whip cream. This whip cream is not to be confused with some cool-whip in a can shit, its freshly made with HEAVY fucking cream. I am telling you, this cream must be made with some kind of heavy molecular weight element because that shit comes out and scoops like ice cream but remains surprisingly light and delicious. 

I don't care how full you are, even if you feel like you are about to burst, you will try one bite of the butter cake and that glutenous masterpiece will create its own void in your gut to fit in as much as you can possibly eat. They could do scientific analysis on the limits of the human stomach with how much this acts and an interrupt between your stomach and brain converting the full signals to FEED ME MOAR BUTTER CAKE signals. 

The long story short, yes, it is good and if you take anyone here who even remotely has food preferences, they will marry your ass on the spot."}
{"text":"I had a bone in steak which was fabulous! I also had the blue cheese Mac and Cheese and the butter cake. The food was fantastic, I would suggest they train their cooks to cook steaks. I ordered medium pink center and I got medium well. Also, I would have loved to add Oscar style but my waiter never mentioned it. Service was good and management was very nice. Worth the price!"}
{"text":"Great music. Bar/lounge area has great energy at 9pm on a Saturday night. Though our cocktail waitress was touch and go with service, the server assistant John was very attentive and made sure we were taken care of throughout the entire meal.  We asked how long he worked there, and though he said 6 months it seemed like he had been working there for a while. We told him that he would make a GREAT server one day and I hope he gets that opportunity."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy my experience but despite very good service, Mastro's disappointed. Outrageously overpriced for subpar quality chilled shellfish. Embellished preparations took away from the quality of the fish dishes. Many better expense account options in Vegas."}
{"text":"Sucks they won't play ARIZONA sports events on their TVs!!! Manager apparently grew up in Tucson..won't show ASU. Since when does the manager come before the customer.??? 3 TVs playing Alabama! Someone payed big bucks for that...welcome to SNOTTSDALE!"}
{"text":"Had a beautiful dining experience here. Came in about 9pm with no rez. No problem! Seated us in 4 minutes and away we went into carb heaven. The restaurant itself is interestingly designed and larger than it looks. Lemon drop martini is a must, AND I MEAN MUST, try. The best I've ever had.... In my entire life. You're in Vegas so splurge on a nice seafood dinner. Get the Spinach side and the Mac and cheese. It's better than winning at slots!"}
{"text":"the  appetizer, salad and desert were great but I had the worst halibut and my wife had tasteless steak which was over cooked ( she asked for medium well )  , will not dine in Mastro's Ocean Club ,  over priced and not worth the time"}
{"text":"Looks like an upscale tree house which I loved. Service was good
We got the:
seafood tower- good but not great
scallops- delicious
ahi tuna tostada- good
jalapeno tuna sashimi- yummy but the jalapeños needed more bite
butter cake- very rich but meh
we also got assorted cocktails that were all very good"}
{"text":"I love the food here, especially the mac and cheese.  The service was horrible.  I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"BEST RESTAURANT I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF DINING AT! HANDS DOWN! 

The people at Mastros truly get it! Service service & more service. My wife & I ate here on our honeymoon & while he food was great, the service was amazing!!!

FOOD: My wife had the sea bass which was incredible. Buttery, delicate, flaky, delectable & flavorful. I had the incredible salmon & I was floored! Not to mention the huge complimentary warm butter cake was THE BEST RESTAURANT DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD! 

SERVICE: We ordered the mac-n-cheese but our waiter brought out the wrong side dish. He didn't dispute it, he didn't make a face or impose a funny energy about it AT ALL! He simply said, oh we're so sorry! Keep this one & I'll bring out the correct side dish. Whattttt?!?! Where do they do that at???? Mastro's apparently! They even plate your sides onto your entree plate for you. Ultimately & even more importantly the servers & bus boys energies were warm & full of laughter & smiles. This ..... Is what service is about as my wife & I rave about this place to everyone! This inspired a HUGE TIP! 

SYNOPSIS: You so called Michelin rated, 4 star uppity high end restaurants could learn a hell of a lot from Mastro's. They have single handed restored my faith that fine dining doesn't have to equate to stuffy, dry, bland, pretentious uninspired service & energy. 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Love this place - usually go to the Ocean Club in Newport Coast.

Seafood tower was received and eaten.  Fantastic.  Love the dry ice steaming down the table.

Dinner - split the wagyu tomahawk chop.  It was huge, but delicious.

Dessert - butter cake...don't bother with anything else."}
{"text":"This is a ridiculously late review as my fiance took me here for Valentine's Day 2016.

We can not say enough about this place, we totally loved every part of it.

The server we had was so friendly, the service was amazing, the food was incredible and we were like two giddy teenagers, it was such an incredible experience.

Of course this place is pricey but it was worth it. My fiance had the rack of lamb and it was cooked perfectly. I had the chilean sea bass and it was also amazing.  We had the infamous buttercream cake and it was everything everyone said it would be, and I'm a chocolate person.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a nice, romantic dinner with their significant other. We definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"I think I must have gone on a bad night and had an awful server because my experience differed from other yelpers.  I'm reserving further comments  on this restaurant until I give it a second chance.  Can't let one server ruin the reputation of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll add to the numerous 5 star ratings here. I was at first skeptical going to this place as its location is in a larger shopping center (pretty typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale). I had been to the Mastro's in New Port Beach, CA and didn't think this one would hold up but I was wrong. This place has it together from the time I called in my reservations to when I walked out the door after dining. Yes it is expensive but at least you feel like you get what you are paying for here. Portion are huge so I suggest sharing and the service staff is happy assist. Thomas our waiter was super professional and friendly. Not a hiccup all night. They have two wine lists, expensive and very expensive. However pricing was not too far out of line from what you would see elsewhere for the same wine. I have had fish literally all over the world and there fish was some of the best I have had any where. I had the wild, line caught, white salmon, delicious! 
To Mastro's owners, please put a Mastro's Ocean Club in San Francisco, I think it would do well there. 
If you have a special occasion or date I highly recommend Mastro's Would/will return when in the Scottsdale area again. 
Only negative I saw was paid valet, at this high end establishment and with tons of available parking it seemed almost silly. 
Tip: Portions are large so share."}
{"text":"I wanted this to knock my socks off, but it fell short.  Mostly due to the service, partly due to the strange atmosphere and the fact that they were 40 minutes late seating us when we had reservations and arrived early for them.

First, the bar.  There is a beautiful bar, great drink list, nice bartenders, piano and lounge singer... all setting up for a relaxing setting, right?  Nope, the lounge singer, with piano accompaniment, sang songs by Katy Perry and Rhianna, and songs like \"Call Me Maybe\".  WTF?  It was just so weird! 

We had 8:30 reservations, arrived around 8:20, and didn't get a table around 9:10.  That's just bad planning on their part, I believe.

Now, the service was the worst part of our meal. The menu is very simple, with no explanations of any of the items.  You would rely on your server to elaborate on preparations, etc, when the menu contains none.  This was where the meal went off the tracks.  There was just a list of all the available entrees (lots of different fish, etc), and our server showed up and said, \"are you guys ready?\".  I said something like, \"we're unsure of the preparations available for each fish\"... and he said something like, \"oh, we can do blackened... you know... whatever......\".  SERIOUSLY?  That's it?  So guess what I ordered... Blackened halibut!  I didn't know how else to order!  Even the salads, the one we ordered was the spicy mambo salad, had no explanation.  What the hell is a spicy mambo salad?  I don't know, so thank god we liked it.  It was like a spicy caesar salad and was very good.  My halibut was delicious, my husband's tuna was great.  Portions are RIDICULOUSLY HUGE.  I wouldn't suggest 2 side dishes for 2 people, just choose one and share it.  We had so much food left over, it was depressing to leave it all to be thrown away, but it's Vegas!  We're not gonna pack leftovers around all night!  After we ordered, the server at the table next to us went through the available preparations with his table, and after hearing them, I would have definitely liked to try several of them.  I was very disappointed by our server.

All in all, the food is delicious, but good food is not hard to find in Vegas.  The service is a big part of making a great meal, and this was lackluster.  Not sure I would return or recommend this restaurant, with all the great options in this town."}
{"text":"Went to Mastro's Friday, Nov 24 to celebrate my daughter-in-laws' birthday.  The meal was fantastic and the service was great.  

I had Grouper and it was so delicious.  We also had a side of scalloped potatoes and pea pods.  For an appetizer we had roasted bone marrow.  Wow that was a treat.

We didn't have dessert however our waiter, Michael, brought a large piece of oh so good chocolate cake to celebrate my DILs' birthday.

Expensive but so worth it for a treat."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Mastro's steakhouse in Costa Mesa, but this was my first visit to an Ocean Club location.  My expectations where pretty high, although I must admit I was not particularly thrilled with the location deep inside Crystals.  However, from start to finish, this was really a first-rate experience.

Service and food were top-notch.  I even had a follow-up call from the GM the next morning to make sure everything was to our satisfaction (which it most certainly was).  I was particularly impressed when, after ordering a bottle of wine which they initially indicated was out-of-stock, the sommelier was able to hunt a bottle down for us. It was this type of service and their overall attention to detail that really impressed me.  

Normally, I stay at Wynncore, so if I had not been staying at Aria on this particular trip, I am not sure I would have made the trip up here.  Now that I've experience the Ocean Club first-hand, I won't hesitate to book a return visit."}
{"text":"I received a gift certificate for this restaurant for my birthday.  Having never heard of it, I looked it up and found out it was the treehouse-like restaurant in Crystals.  Now, interestingly, I have always wanted to eat there but I never knew what it was called or anything about it.   Having eaten there, I'm not sure why I've never heard anything about it.  I belong to a number of Las Vegas forums and Facebook pages and have never heard this place mentioned.  That's a mistake.  You can't mention all the fine dining seafood and steak restaurants and not have Mastro's on the list.  

OK, so having read some Yelp reviews, my big takeaway was that portions were large.  My friend and I checked and splitting plates wouldn't be a problem.  We thought, \"Great!  We can split everything and use up the $110 and even if we go over a little bit, no big deal;\" we were quite certain we would get enough to eat.  Famous last words!

First up was a bread bowl.  OK, that's just evil right there.  Four different kinds of bread and you know you have to try one of each.  Just try not to finish any of them---more food is coming---more than you know.

We ordered a warm spinach salad.  They split that for us and we each had a normal sized salad in front of us.  Everything about this salad was delicious, including the bacon and cheese. The dressing was so good and there's still some bread so you know the bread went into the dressing because, well, sometimes you really can't get enough of a good thing.

For our entree, we split a 22oz bone in ribeye, creamed corn, steamed asparagus and steamed spinach.  When they brought the sizzling plate with the ribeye and put it front of me, I was quite sure they hadn't split it yet.  I was wrong and this big honkin' piece of meat was half!!!  It was cooked to perfection and still cooking on that plate.  So, here's the problem, we ate the meat.  I don't know where my stomach found room but that wasn't going to waste.  Sadly, after we had our first portions of vegetables, whatever vegetables were left in their bowls didn't make it to our plates.  We were so completely stuffed.

But, wait, it was our birthdays (4/7 and 4/21) so we celebrated with warm butter cake.  OK, that's just wrong, on so many levels.  I thought the bread was evil but the butter cake Is the devil incarnate.  Oh, we're not done yet.  Here comes a bowl of  home made whipped cream for the cake.  The bowl was so big, you could have taken a bath in it.  

My friend and I agreed we are going back to this restaurant but we are bringing other people with us because, honestly, three or four people would have been very well fed on all this food.  The decor, atmosphere, and service (Gino, you are the best!!!) pushes this restaurant over the top.  They have many peers but none better!"}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be something awesome, but the staff really held us back from enjoying what could have been a wonderful experience. Service started out good but before we even got around to placing our order they were already falling flat. No drink menu or wine list for starters and to go along with that no wine recommendations. I guess if you don't want us to order wine, 1) don't give us a menu, 2) don't mention what pairs well. Service got obnoxiously slow after we ordered our food, so bad that one of our party went and lodged a complaint with the manager. The only saving grace on this visit was the food. Everyone seemed to enjoy their plates. I ordered the filet, which came out wonderful and cooked perfectly. For what they charge here, everything should have been dialed in, it's unfortunate that we didn't have the same experience so many others were able to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great steak, drinks and good sides. Service was attentive and the live music was very good the night I was there. I truly enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"I only ate here once, so I am only rating the one meal I had there. But when I tried the Chilean Sea Bass, my faith in God re-emerged. I saw the light! Honestly one of the best things I've had in my life. Maybe I don't get out enough, or maybe I was so hungry that even vegan food would have the same effect. It's expensive as hell, by my standards, so if you've got the benjamins check it out."}
{"text":"Mastro's knows how to make a great meal and this place is no exception. We had a reservation on a busy Spring Training Tuesday night. However, we waited for 45 minutes past the reservation time because they were waiting on our table to get up. I was not a happy camper but they did give us a glass of champagne while we waited and bought our desserts. It was a nice gesture to make up for the wait and they were doing the same for others in a similar circumstance.

Ok, the food- fantastic. Grilled swordfish and crab gnocchi with black truffles on the side. Out of this world. They know how to cook food exactly how you want it.

Dessert was the fabulous butter cake and creme brûlée (just okay). I will always return to Mastro's but the wait thing was annoying."}
{"text":"Everything done to perfection. On one visit, my swordfish was grilled deliciously and was a perfect compliment to the crab gnocchi.

On a subsequent visit, I had the crab cakes appetizer for an entree and was not disappointed. The portion size was generous. I also tried to small Caesar salad which I liked very much.

Of course, the pretzel bread and buttercake are amazing! Service was very friendly and warm. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing shrimp cocktail and oysters. Crisp perfect sea bass. If you are looking for somewhere to blow your winnings, this is it."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Best restaurant in the Aria area.  Inside the shopping mall but atomsphere, presentaiton, service, and food are excellent.  Seafood and steak are excellent there.  Will always come here.  A bit pricey...but you're in Vegas and you're going to pay when you go to a restaurant near the Strip.  Since you're going to pay...might as well have the food, service and atmosphere worth it's value. All THREE is 5 stars here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to the Mastro's in Thousand Oaks and just had to come to the one in Las Vegas of course! The food was on point, the waiter was sooooo on top of it! The wait was about no more than 10 minutes and we we're seated. Will come again and bring the family to have an exquisite dinner !"}
{"text":"You will definitely get your money's worth coming here. The food is delicious. I can honestly say it's like nothing I've ever tried before. I got the petite filet Oscar-style. The steak alone was $45 and it's a $36 extra to get Oscar-style. Which in my opinion was totally worth it. The taste was amazing. I also recommend the dream berry martini. It's my favorite drink from there and you can't leave without trying the signature butter cake !"}
{"text":"We had six in our party and had a great experience.  Great live piano player, cool ambiance, 5 star quality food, reasonable wine list, and nice staff.  I love this restaurant.

The only possible knock is the dining room, although sleek and modern with an amazing architectural tree house in the middle, is in the mall.  Even though this mall has the highest of high end shops, it still feels a bit like your eating in a mall. No biggee for me, just something to consider.

Food:
Steak 5 stars - ribeye was an excellent cut and perfectly prepared
Salad 5 stars - really simple but well done
Wine list and our selection - 5 star - great bottle at reasonable price
Desert - butter cake?  10 stars - best desert I have ever had - our group talked about it the rest of the trip 

Service:
Polite, professional and well trained.  What you get in a AAA five diamond restaurant.  Mastros should be proud.  This is even more rare than great food.

Ambiance: 
The piano player, ultra modern dining area and spacious layout make this a great place for a business meeting, special occasion or date night.  

Overall - awesome ++ Love it!"}
{"text":"I would rate this more of a 3.5.  For starters, the decor and architecture of this restaurant is absolutely breathtaking.  Based in the center of a classy mall, the treehouse area has a unique and interesting view of everything around you.  We went around 9, so no one was really shopping and the mall was pretty bare. I felt like I was in a different world!  For a Monday night the restaurant was hardly crowded and we were seated immediately at a table of our choice.  The complimentary bread was interesting, although there were several pieces that were extremely hard to bite into, I enjoyed the soft pretzel-like bread the most.  For drinks we tried the lemon drop and the cantaloupe martini.  Both very awesome, and the cool thing is that they come with the martini shaker, so you end up getting two drinks really.  I enjoyed both drinks, the cantaloupe one tasted like sweet cantaloupe but strong enough to get you buzzed.  As for the lemon drop, it was soooo cool - they put some kinda sizzling dry ice or something in it so it looked like a volcano when it came out.  I sat there in awe for like 2 minutes just staring at the smoke come out of my drink! Then sipped on it and got buzzed 10 min after hahahhaha.  

As for the entree, we ordered the rib eye medium rare, macaroni and cheese, and creamed corn.  I'm sad to say but I wasn't too impressed with the rib eye.  I felt like it was cooked in fire too high - the bone was completely charred.  Even though the inside was medium rare, the outside had bad burnt areas all around it.  And since we shared a plate, they brought out another plate for me, but it was soooo hot that when we put food on it, the oil kept splattering on me!!!  I mean granted it was a nice gesture, but I did not like how bits of oil kept splattering on my nice dress!  So anyhow, despite the slight disappointment in the steak, the macaroni and creamed corn TOTALLY made up for it.  The macaroni came out in a sizzling pan where the cheese would not stop ooozing when you tried to take a spoon full of it off....just the way I like it!!! I couldn't stop eating the side items that I probably would have rather eaten those as my meal rather than the steak itself!

Anyhowl, I dont know if I'd come back for the steak, but I definitely appreciated the view, side items, and drinks.  Our bill came out to be $110 for 2 drinks, 2 side items, and 1 rib eye.  It was what we were expecting for a steakhouse at this caliber so not surprised.  I rounded up on the rating only because between the two of us, we shared the leftover mac and cheese and creamed corn the next day and still were satisfied :)"}
{"text":"I had an all out wonderful experience at the Masto's Ocean Club. The service, food and environment was amazing! I would definitely give it a...Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Excellent anniversary dinner experience!  Dinner drinks and staff were all excellent. The manager cam out and greeted us which was a real treat. Although we're reserving this restaurant for our special occasions, we can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is always great and always consistent. Great food and never disappointing. 
I make it a point to order everything with minimal to no butter and they are always accommodating. 
Make your reservations early. It is always busy there."}
{"text":"We had the king crab claws for appetizer.  They were fantastic; the spicy cocktail sauce was very good with them.  We tried the chopped salad and clam chowder instead of the shared sides we usually have and they were both very good. The best part of the meal was the wagyu sirloin, it was unbelievably tender.   For desert we had the butter cake, it's to die for nothing like it anywhere else."}
{"text":"The setting and cuisine is awesome. Our server, Andy, was amazing. He was Very knowledgable and enthusiastic about all the dishes and drinks. They did not have a traditional Sangria but the bartender made it happen. The intimate lighting and layout make it a great place to take a first date or have an anniversary dinner. The main bar has a television so you won't miss out on the game. The Scottish salmon is cooked to perfection and the Hennessy Sidecar is delicious. Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food and service at the bar.  They served up my favorite turf and surf to order with garlic mashed potatoes and house special salad.  Perfect ending with black raspberry Sorbet and a cappuccino.  I highly recommend this place.   Glass of red wine was ok, not great, otherwise 5 stars."}
{"text":"Decent seafood in an odd location. You are in the middle of a mall. Most of the times I've eaten in a mall has been at a food court. This isn't a food court, its a high end seafood place that costs a good chunk. 

The seafood tower was excellent except for the peanut sized oysters. My salad was very good. My tuna entree was on a par with Outback Steakhouse. 

Not enough going on here to make me want to go back. Even if you got to sit in the alien mothership, it wouldn't calm the odd feeling you get here.

Flat to slightly upturned face."}
{"text":"Man this food is physically hot, no touchy the plate. Very good upscale seafood restaurant that is a branch of Mastro's steakhouse.  Still had a few steak choices, as well as their signature pound cake dessert; which is my favorite!

I expected to hear crickets (on a Tuesday night) upon entering with the down turned economy and all, but instead was greeted by a packed full boisterous dining room!  Apparently our economy is alive and well in Scottsdale, hope it spreads to the rest of the nation ;)"}
{"text":"The service and food were incredible.  This meal was worth every penny. We started with the wedge salad. My husband and I split the salad,  which I'm glad we did because it was large.  For the entree I had the big eye tuna served sushi style and it was fantastic.  We ordered the sweet potato side dish and it was heaven in a bowl.  I will eat here again the next time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Last night I had a terrible meal.   The calamari was over breaded and there were only rings, no legs.   Both fish entries were over cooked and flavorless.  If you want a really expensive Denny's ($250 for 2, wine / no desert) this is the place.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I am a fan for sure.  The service and food is top notch, but my main problem with Mastos in Las Vegas is location.  The location (which is a huge factor with fine dining) is in the center of a high end indoor mall and it's loud.  Mastros can not control ambiance and echoing noise from the mall including the 80s hair band music that was playing throughout the mall.  I have been to Mastros in New Port and I should say the mood is very different there because they can control it.  So all in all.  Food Great...Service Great....Location Not Great."}
{"text":"Can you say yummmmy!!! Ocean Club might be slightly more pricey than many establishments.... but it is for definitely a good reason- it rocks! Who knew you could get such wonderful seafood in the desert, I realize that they have other locations, but being that it is Arizona, tasty seafood comes few and far between. Not only is the food amazing, but the entire package. Chic low-key dinning, a tasteful bar, and terrific service."}
{"text":"\"First Timer\" this was a good  dining experience! The restaurant itself was nice, the staff was friendly 
 shocked we have never had Mastro's before. For drinks we ordered the Buddha Belly which was good.The bartender Sheryl was very nice and outgoing with great personality! We sat down our waiter was super nice and knowledgeable. I ordered the Seabass It was tender, seasoned very flavorful. My boyfriend ordered the ribeye he enjoyed it.. He also ordered the lobster tail loaded potatoes and the Mac n cheese I am definitely coming back here. Dessert we ordered the butter cake it was a little dry and didn't really taste all that amazing to me a little over rated in my opinion"}
{"text":"This is the only fancy restaurant I've been to in Las Vegas. So, I'm sure there are others that live up. But for me in my experience. This was the best wine, best steak I have ever had. The restaurant was beautiful but a little noisy being in the middle of a mall. But I would absolutely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful Restaurant! Really like the way huge windows can be opened to evening air. Great little band is the bar during happy hour with nice crowd.

I was with a very large group that challenged the kitchen. The kitchen was clearly stressed after apps were served, but the blackened tuna and perfect calamari were served spot on! The best calamari I have ever had. I could have left completely satisfied after having this dish!

However, blackened Mahi mahi was also in our future.....

Our table was served much later than others in the group, and we had to get the attention of wait-staff when one diner wasn't served at all. They quickly responded. The fish was cooked very well, and I enjoyed the creamed corn and broccoli sides, but thought all could have been kicked up a notch with seasoning or topping."}
{"text":"Although this is what I consider one of my favorite restaurants in the Phx metro area, I just can't bring myself to give it a full five....dining in the lounge is a must from the (sometimes) live music and impressive people watching.  If their service was that much more \"on it!\" ,decrease the average patron age by 10 years, have the band's play music from my generation, add a few more Malbecs to the wine list, and other than that, this place is perfect.

The price for the food is right although in no way cheap, the lobster mashed potatoes, are always a must.  For any dessert lover, most menu items come with fresh whipped cream....yum!

I love that this place is classy yet not too stuffy where they do not require a jacket, a NO jeans or NO sandals policy, and even allow me to wear my hat....

Parking sucks, so one is pretty much forced to pay for valet which will leave you some singles foe the bathroom attendant....

Folks, I am taking something close to perfect yet pointing out the items that I take into account.  You will be sure to impress anyone you bring here and if you don't have a budget and care what you spend, enjoy and go nuts."}
{"text":"WOW I was pretty impressed with this place and I've done my share of dining in Vegas. The decor was modern and in the middle had this treehouse area where there are more tables. That night, they happened to have the treehouse rented out so there was live music playing which got a bit annoying since it was loud. That was my main complaint. 

On to the food. We started with the seafood tower and I wasn't even hungry going into this dinner but I gobbled everything up. It had jumbo shrimp cocktail, kunumoto oysters, crab claws, lobster, and king crab legs, the works. It was presented with dry ice. They served it with cocktail sauce, this mustard sauce and atomic horseradish, when you mix all 3 it was a pretty good sauce that way too. 

I was pretty full so I opted to get a salad and I chose the iceberg salad. Now I have to say i always get dressings on the side but this dressing was a red wine vinaigrette but it was creamy looking. The waitress said it was emulsified but there was no cream in it. It was the BEST salad dressing I have ever had! I think i wanted to dip every lettuce in a spoonful of dressing, that's how much I liked it.  It just had this tangy taste (from the red wine) but a smooth creamy texture but it had no creme. YUM!

I tried my bf's steak and he had the rib eye and it was delicious, melt in your mouth meat. Our favorite steak houses in Vegas are Michael's (Southpoint) and Cut (Palazzo) but I think Mastro's takes the cake on this. We had so many sides, potato's au gratin, snow peas, yam fries, mac and cheese but I heard the gnocci here was delicious from the rest of our party although I was too stuffed to try. 

But the best part of dinner was the dessert! We had the warm butter cake, it tasted like a mix of pound cake and maybe cheesecake but it is served with vanilla ice cream and had a creamy inside, and sugar flakes line the cake to give it texture. Oh and it comes with homemade whip cream! I think that was better than the ice cream, I wanted to eat gobs of it. 

This is definitely a favorite now although the seafood tower is VERY pricey, it was probably half of the price of the meal, and we were with a party of 10. n"}
{"text":"WOWEEEE!! What a dinner experience. EVERYTHING from service, food, and  ambiance was exceptional! I had the sea bass, which they are well known for and I was definitely not disappointed! We also ordered several sides including mushrooms, asparagus, and of course the seafood tower... HOLY OHH EMMM GEEE!!! Amazing!!! If you really want to indulge you must try the famous butter cake...I could feel my butt getting bigger, but it was absolutely worth the 10 miles I had to run after!

Dinner is lavish and expect to pay for it....but you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A type of restaurant for very special occasions and/or company expensed dinners. A 5-star experience from the service, attention & of course, the bone-in rib eye."}
{"text":"I'm being critical here. The Mastros in Costa Mesa, Ca, is my favorite steak house anywhere. The Mastros Ocean Club in Laguna Beach has an awesome coastal location. This Mastros is in a mall. Enough said."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday celebration and the prices justified as much.  We gave our buddy a lot of crap for not being specific about tap water and we ended up with a fee of $20 for flat water.  Oh well.  I'll take the story any day.

This is definitely a white table cloth establishment.  It's not super stuffy, but this isn't the place to roll in wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  The restaurant is beautifully designed and if you can, try to sit in the \"pod\" where you get a view of the mall interior and everyone walking around.

Food was excellent.  We shared the shrimp cocktail and the vanilla battered shrimp for appetizers, and to this day, I still remember that vanilla battered shrimp.  Probably one of the best appetizers I have had.  My main course was the chilean sea bass.  The serving size was enormous and it brought off into perfect flakes during consumption.

For the side dishes we had the asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  Highly recommend either but their selection has a lot to offer.

Service was attentive as expected and best of all got to use a little bit of Polish."}
{"text":"We went to Mastro's on a Sunday early evening for dinner.  There were maybe three to four other tables occupied but other than that there was plenty of good seating available.  

Speaking of seating, I found the set up a little off-putting...we were seated at a two person table that butted directly against the back of a circular seating arrangement, which just so happened to contain 3-4 lovely active young children on this day.  Somehow your ability to enjoy a nice meal is a bit inhibited with a 5 year old staring at you from 1.5 feet away.  Perhaps it was our fault for not requesting one of the 50 odd other empty tables.

As other yelpsters have stated it is also a bit weird to be enjoying a $$$$ meal with Miley Cyrus cranking in the background due to the open seating overlooking/hearing the mall like Crystal Shops.  Enough nit picking though, on to the food!

Our server was very attentive and started us out promptly with ice water and tea.  Micro demerit for including a lemon in my iced tea after asking to hold the lemon, but no big deal.  Huge stars go out to the staff for keeping the beverages brimming full, a frequent problem for such an iced tea addict as myself.  The bread service came with enough to feed a small army.  Mini-loaves of sourdough, pretzel, bruschetta, and French.  

We ordered the Calamari ($15).  There was plenty for the two of us, lightly breaded and including a lemon side and a dipping sauce very similar to the Outback sauce you get with bloomin onions.  

Taking the \"go big or go home\" philosophy I decided to order the twin lobster tails ($69) AND 22 oz Ribeye ($55) for my entree.  My girlfriend ordered the sea bass ($50) and we split a side of lobster mashed potatoes ($38).  

The steak was wonderfully charred, cooked medium.   The server was nice enough to \"de-shell\" the lobster tails.  The lobster was perfectly cooked and delicious with melted butter.  The sea bass was also excellent.  I let my date enjoy the majority of the potatoes as they were a bit soupy due to the sauce but the small portion I had did taste good.  

We got the butter cake to go, not sure on the price, it came complete with detailed instructions on how to best prepare it from our server.  Final bill with tip $325."}
{"text":"Top three talked about phrases for this place from Yelp:

1) Lobster Mashed Potatoes (already tried in LA)
2) tree house (sounds interesting, I'll take two!)
3) Chilean Sea Bass (since it's the ocean club I will definitely try this)

Okay just kidding I didn't really order the tree house. It was pretty cool to be seated there because I saw this the last time I was walking around here and had no idea it was for Mastro's. For such a nice restaurant I really expect the sea bass to be of top notch but it sadly was not. We split some sides of scalloped potatoes (everyone thought these were gross and overly salty), sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and mac & cheese. The sides are nice but none of that really matters if the main entree doesn't hit the spot.

My friend order the special \"tomahawk\" steak which is a massive piece of meat on a gimongous bone, making it look like a tomahawk - pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"I had by far the best dining experience of my life here! Truffle gnocchi and the wagyu steak are the way to go! Also the dessert martinis are killer! Beautiful restaurant and exceptional service. I will go back!"}
{"text":"We did not eat this time around.  We just stopped in for some late night drinks.  The setting is great.  The bar is a cool place.  Our bartender was knowledgable, friendly and attentive.  She also did a great job mixing our drinks.  I ordered a caipirinha.  There are many places that somehow manage to screw them up, but she nailed it.  We will have to return to eat at some point."}
{"text":"Mastro's literally is THE best restaurant in Las Vegas. 

The restaurant overlooks the main floor of Crystal's and is absolutely gorgeous. Very spacious with plenty of seating area.

I've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. In fact, I think I'm even more impressed each and every time I go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again. 

Service: Impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. I've had a light skinned African American male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing I should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. I've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal. 

Food: To die for. The best bone-in ribeye I've ever had. I've tried quite a few steakhouses in Las Vegas (ribeyes because I am obsessed) and none compare to Mastro's. Their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! I've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, tuna tartare, lobster mashed potatoes (a must try), Gorgonzola mac and cheese, king crab black truffle gnocchi, creamed corn, and the brussels sprouts (gotta have some veggies).

Wine: They have one of my favorite Cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, Chateau St. Jean. Highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.

Dessert: Do the butter cake. Comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. Sweet, warm, and delicious!

I love this restaurant. Writing this review makes me want to go there this week. A perfect 5!"}
{"text":"Just had one of the best meals of my life! The hubby and I ordered the Wagu boned in ribeye along with a lobster roll served with sugar snap peas. The meat was tender and tasty and the sushi was amazing as well, we loved the combination along with our wine. For dessert we shared the butter cake which was a HUGE plate of pure indulgence. The service was too notch, the restrooms were clean, the ambiance was elegant and romantic. They opened the windows as the sun set and allowed the fresh breeze in. We felt like we were really taken care of. Our server, Patrick, was friendly and knowledgeable. Can't wait to come back again! Wish we didn't live in the snowy tundra of Wisconsin! It truly was a 5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Went here to the bar the other weekend.  Order the Sauteed Shrimp and the Clam Chowder to munch on while we ordered some drinks.  Both apps were great.  Went with the Classic Long Island and saw the bartender use top shelf booze so I was happy with that.  Overall, we had a gift card to the place and came away happy and satisfied even though I wouldn't normally spend $20 per drink or app but everything was delicious none the less.

Note: Dress code says business casual but since it's located in a mall and it's Vegas, they're pretty lenient on it."}
{"text":"The food is spectacular and the butter cake is perhaps the greatest dessert I will ever have. The price is consistent with the food quality. I had the Chilean sea bass and mac and cheese w lobster cocktail as a n appetizer and the presentation alone was worth the price. Also their drinks are spectacular feel free to try all the concoctions as they are all spectacular. However the service does falter a bit. They waiters and waitresses come off as a bit snobby and at times seem to be bothered by talking to the guests. Again its not that the service is bad its just that for a restaurant of their caliber there is better. Also because of the design of the restaurant it does get a bit loud."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the whole world. It is unbelievable and you will not be disappointed. All of the cocktails are amazing, the steaks and seafood are fantastic, and the portions are huge. I have traveled all over the world and can safely say Ocean club is absolutely the best!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I don't often eat at restaurants this pricey but maybe once or twice a year, so when we do we really want to be sure that it's worth it. Some friends of our invited us out and really wanted to go here, the reviews made it sound wonderful so we agreed. The reviews, glowing as they are, don't do it justice in my opinion. Everything from the service to the food to the atmosphere is top notch. 

We sat in the treehouse. We'd seen this structure before when we'd walked through Crystals (the mall the restaurant is located in) and had no idea what it was, so we were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find out that the main dining room is located in this unique architectural feature. From below, you would think it's not that spacious, but feels very airy due to the open nature of the design. We didn't feel cramped in any way, and we had a party of 6. 

The waite staff are dressed in white jackets and bowties and they are the best at what they do. You feel very well taken care of without feeling watched or \"hovered\" over. 

The food is amazing. I won't mince words here, it's expensive and everything is 'a la carte', but the portions are substantial and the sides are easily shareable. In fact, that's the only potential \"negative\" of our experience. We ordered WAY TOO MUCH food, but that's not our server's fault. He warned us but we refused to believe him. The good news is we got to try a little bit of everything, the bad news is we ate a little too much of everything and still had food left over! 

I had the Chilean Sea Bass cooked \"oreganata\" style, which was amazing. They really know how to prepare seafood here. It's easy to overcook fish but this was cooked perfectly. Sea Bass is one of my favorite fish and this is easily one of the best I've ever had.  My wife decided to REALLY splurge and ordered one of the specials that was on offer, an 8oz Japanese Wagyu Steak for $125. Words don't do it justice. It was delicious. It melted in your mouth and was just buttery, rich and savory. Not a trace of gristle, every bite was perfect. 

Our friends ordered the roasted chicken which was excellent, a bone in ribeye with truffle butter which was almost as amazing as the Wagyu Steak for half the price, and halibut, which was also excellent and perfectly cooked. We started with oysters (I'm not a oyster connoisseur so I can't provide any more detail than that) and for sides we had sauteed asparagus, creamed spinach, gorgonzola mac and cheese, salt and vinegar fries and lobster mashed potatoes (now you see why we ordered too much food). All of the aforementioned items were excellent but the standout was the lobster mashed potatoes. We're not talking about mashed potatoes with bits of lobster flavor, we're talking about mashed potatoes drenched in melted butter with massive chunks of lobster. Seriously, there was not a bit of lobster less than an inch thick in there. It was fantastic. 

For dessert we again ordered too much. We had the butter cake (and you should too) which was easily shareable by 4 or more people, but again since I didn't believe the waiter, we ordered two. We also had chocolate covered strawberries and Key Lime Pie, both of which were fantastic, but the butter cake is a standout! 

Drinks. The wine menu is extensive and the beer selection was pretty decent too for a \"fancy\" type of place (which in my experience usually seem to look down on beer). The signature cocktails/martinis were delicious and, again, nicely portioned for the price. $17 seems pricey for a martini until you realize they give you the shaker with practically another entire glass full in there for a top off. They also have a nice selection of ports, dessert wines, and cordials for after dinner. I don't usually splurge on an \"after dinner\" drink, but I was in full on splurge mode that night, so I did. The waiter recommended a white dessert wine as opposed to a port since it would pair better with the butter cake, and he was not wrong. I had no idea what was good so I went with his recommendation, which was a Royal Tokaji 5 Puttonyos Aszu wine for $25. It blew me away. It was thick, viscous and sweet but not overly sweet and the flavor was a delicate array of fruit (apricot, hints of citrus and honey) with a creamy, slightly smoky finish. I immediately looked it up online and ordered a bottle for home, which was $50, that's how much I loved it. 

I can't reiterate enough how special this experience was to us. Our total for 6 people was a little over $800, but that price seems perfectly justified based on our experience. We would return here without hesitation, although we would definitely listen to our waiter next time when he says we might be ordering too much food, and if we were to show more restraint on our next visit, I think we could get out the door for under $200 (for 2 people). Which as a meal for a special occasion would be more than worth the price."}
{"text":"Made dinner reservations for Saturday night at 8pm to celebrate our birthdays.  Once we arrived (just before 8), we were promptly seated, and then almost immediately greeted by our server.  We were told about the specials, given the wine list, and then a basket of warm bread was delivered to the table.  We started with Oysters Rockefeller and a Caesar Salad.  Dinner was the salmon for me, and rack of lamb for my husband with sautéed broccoli as a side.  Everything was delicious, and spaced out to where we did not feel rushed what so ever.  Not only was the food top notch, so was the service.  In fact, due to the fact that we were celebrating birthdays, the brought us a complimentary piece of the 5 layer chocolate cake with fresh whip cream that was to die for!  Thank You Maestros for making our birthday celebration wonderful!"}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to go here two nights in a row during CES. It was awesome. The steaks are high quality and cooked perfectly. The sides were all very good. The seafood tower is a fun thing to order with the dry ice making a cool effect at the table. On the 2nd night we hd a group of 15 and they put us in a private room which was nice. If you need to make a large reservation ask for Carly... she was very helpful!"}
{"text":"Ambience, service and upscale environment....all as advertised. The food, however, was very salty and not fitting of the high price tag. We ordered two filets(medium) and a side of creamed spinach. The steaks were brought out and appeared to have been cooked medium well, again at a place like this, you would expect better.    Creamed spinach tasted as if they dumped a whole carton of salt in it. Overall, it was very much below expectation."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service. OUTSTANDING FOOD. We try to come every time we are in town.

My favorite restaurant in Vegas. Even beats the Ocean Club in Newport Beach CA. They give you the right amount of service at the table, checking on you timely but without interrupting or being overbearing. When the set up the table, I saw the manager readjusting to make sure the setting was perfect, they even put a light on the wine and water glasses to make sure they are perfectly clean! Everyone is super polite, you are rushed but not left unattended either. They have nailed it! We really appreciated it.

Food is delicious. From the bread, to the crab cocktail, to the steak, lobster mashed potatoes and last but not least the butter cake. All to die for. 

You really get what you pay for here! And it's worth it! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Got the bone-in KC cut was perfect. Cream of corn amazing, lobster mash potatoes wow. But nothing and I mean nothing comes close to the butter cake desert with the home made whip cream. 

Service was outstanding and one thing I really liked was that when the sides came out the servers would go around the table and place some for each one of us. 

Outstanding Steak House"}
{"text":"Our dining experience at Mastros was exceptional. The dinner started with our amazing guide Paul W.   Paul recommended the perfect appetizer, entree, wine, and dessert. Our service was world class.  Paul attended to every minute detail.  My seabass was cooked perfectly and our mushrooms seasoned to perfection.  Lastly,  the cream Brûlée was heavenly.  I would highly recommend calling for a reservation and ask for Paul W you will be set."}
{"text":"Been to many Mastros food is always great but ambience could be better been to mastered in OC costs Mesa is the best"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago I went to dinner by myelf at Mastro's Ocean Club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new Crystal's shopping mall at City Center. 

It was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, Parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but I restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the Spicy Mambo Salad ($7.99) and the Sauteed Shrimp appetizer ($18.95). Everything at Mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. The Spicy Mambo Salad was essentially a Caesar salad with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, I very much enjoyed it. I always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and Mastro's was no exception. If anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, I would ask for extra. The sauteed shrimp were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. The huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a lobster bisque reduction rich with butter. The cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. It was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. Overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. One item that I might have tried as a side had I been with someone, however, was the lobster mashed potatoes - they looked fantastic. I wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as I still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.

I wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and I was full by that point, I decided to pass. I'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time I go and I'm not by myself I'll splurge and get it."}
{"text":"We went here last night for my girlfriend's birthday.  Mixed feelings about our experience.  To start off with, the service was impeccable.  Daniel and Tim made sure to constantly check in and my water glass was never empty.  We started out with the strawberry mules which tasted good and strong.  We skipped an appetizer and just munched on the bread basket which was also tasty.  For dinner, we ordered the lobster mash and steamed broccoli to share as our family style sides.  Our server came back to apologize that they were out of broccoli so we switched to spinach.  Both were good.  We loved the lobster mash.
For our entrees, we ordered the 8oz petite filet, Chilean sea bass, sautéed scallops and another fish dish that I cannot recall at this time.  My scallops were great.  My friend said the other fish I can't recall was great as well.  Birthday girl had the petite filet and stated after her first bite that the quality of meat was definitely lacking.  After us all trying a bite, we agreed it did not taste like a very high quality meat.  The server confirmed it was corn fed beef sourced from various Midwestern farms.  Surprising for such a high quality restaurant to source corn fed beef.  The Chilean sea bass our other friend ordered was a bit over cooked making it dried out as well.  We mentioned our dislike of the steak to our server and he did apologize and offer to get us started on something else.  We were all sharing our meals and noted it was fine and we didn't need a replacement dish.  For dessert, we were treated to a happy birthday slice of chocolate cake (a bit dry) as well as the butter cake (which was phenomenal).  In the end, the steak was taken off our bill and both desserts were comped.  The service made our experience enjoyable despite some of our dishes being off.  5 stars for service, 3 stars for taste of food, 3 stars for price in comparison to quality of food.  Unfortunately, not sure the price is worth the quality of food you receive at this one."}
{"text":"Mastro's really is as good as it gets.  They were so good, my bf and I came here twice during our three night excursion in Vegas.  The service here is impeccable, the food top notch and the ambiance exquisite and dramatic.  

The first time we were served on by Tanya who delivered exemplary service all night.  We ordered the seafood tower with beluga caviar, lobster, raw oysters, crab and shrimp.  Everything was fresh and even tastier with the atomic horseradish condiment, red onions, parsley, egg white, egg yoke and capers.  If you like it hot, the horseradish here is simply the best.  It will give you an amp, clear your sinuses immediately and possibly cause you to shed a tear.  The escargot was soft and delectable with a garlic and buttery taste.  I can't pick out what herbs they put on them, but there was a greater complexity on the palette to make it more interesting.  We ordered a nice bottle of Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc to compliment the seafood.  Dinner was so satisfying, we didn't have room for dessert, but we ended it with a couple of dirty martinis.  Unbeknownst to us, they also bring an entire shaker with the remnant vodka leftover!  Let's just say we left a little behind.

Unfortunately, a couple hours later my bf fell ill, but I didn't.  As always when ordering raw shellfish, it's always a possibility to get a bad oyster.  It was only disappointing to have to end the night so soon.  However, the way Mastro's handled it was outstanding.  We didn't have to call them to inform them how our dining experience went.  They called the next day to make sure it was good.  I ended up speaking to Sherry and told her about our wonderful experience minus the bad oyster.  She was extremely empathetic and invited us back in to make it right.  We gladly accepted the invitation and dined at Mastro's again a couple days later.

We were seated in the tree house again and Lionel waited on us this time.  He was every bit charming with a sense of humor and also delivered immaculate service.  We both had to use restraint  from devouring the fine variety of artisan breads in the basket.  We both shared the Tomahawk Kobe Beef bone-in ribeye medium rare.  All I can say is wow!  This was the best steak ever.  The softness of each morsel, darker color and bolder flavor was a real pleasure for us.  We ordered the escargot again and tried the roasted brussell sprouts and sauteed spinach- both cooked to perfection and tasty.  Lionel recommended a nice cab which I can't remember what- maybe Hill?  Nevertheless, it was a perfect compliment to our steak.  We ended the meal with a nice sponge cake dessert with fruit, whip cream and a couple ports.

Dinner at Mastro's in their architectural masterpiece called the \"tree house\" was the perfect last dinner in Vegas before going home.  Their appreciation for their customers and solicitous attitude really make this place top notch.  We definitely appreciated all they did to compensate for the bad oyster from the first visit on our second visit.  We had an amazing time and are sure to return next time we are in Vegas. 

Thank you Mastro's for a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club is all about energy and quality.   I am a fan for several reasons.  

First and foremost, the steak's are amazing and the seafood tower is so wrong (RIGHT!!) on every level.  

Additionally, it is great to go somewhere that has a great energy to it and just makes you feel good, excited and full of life.  And the people watching is some of the best in Scottsdale. I will say nothing more as you have to experience it.  The bar team does a great job and the cocktail waitresses work hard and always have a smile on their face. The servers I have had have been professional and available without hovering.  Some have the skill for bonding with the table and some don't but all are excellent at what they do.  The music is fun and full of life.  

And finally, the management team is amazing. I was sad to see Frank leave but am thrilled that Nick has been promoted and know he will continue the VIP feeling they have always been known for.   Definitely check them out. So worth it."}
{"text":"We called for reservations a few hours prior to our requested time & were delightfully accommodated. There were 4 of us & we ordered the following to sharekids:

Appetizer: 
Seafood tower (amazing)
Escargot (I can't comment because I don't eat it, but the others agreed that it went well with the puff pastry it was served with)

Main Courses:
Tomahawk Wagyu Steak, Scallops & Lobster (all very delicious)

We were so stuffed, we couldn't even look at the dessert menu. 

Service: could've been better. Our waiter seemed to be occupied with a larger party & when he would walk by our table, I noticed he didn't look our way to check on whether or not we needed anything. We nearly had to flag him down every time as he passed us quickly. Large table, small table, which ever it may be...needs equal amount if attention. Especially if you don't want your tip to start decreasing. 

The minus 1 star is for their lack of service & their water selection (still or sparkling). Some are OK with tap & it wasn't at least offered."}
{"text":"Very few restaurants I've ever eaten in has ever left me walking away so satisfied feeling that they couldn't possibly top themselves... except Mastro's. From being ushered into the beautifully unique wooden architecture aka the \"Treehouse\" that housed the restaurant, to the exceptional service and, being, overall, treated like royalty, my party of three had pretty much felt that we had eaten at the best restaurant in Las Vegas. 

Nestled aesthetically inside the Crystals at the City Center besides Aria Hotel, Mastro's was incorporated within the shopping center, in the midst of luxury brand names: Vuitton, Zegna, Cartier, et al. The most striking feature of the restaurant was how the interior of the restaurant is actually built into a structure that resembled a treehouse skeleton, with no solid walls in the main dining room. This monstrosity emerged from the ground floor and grew at least eight stories into the air and eventually flowing symbolically into the ceiling. 

The dining experience was superb. Highly attentive, the staff reminded me of 3-Michelin star restaurants but at much lower prices and with sense of humor that made it fun and even more memorable. The maitre d', well-dressed in a fine suit, was always attentive over the entire dining space like a hawk and was quick to address diners' requests. Our waiter was especially quirky and cracked a few tongue-in-cheek jokes that were appropriate for our young, lively group.

As for the quality, it was on par with most upscale restaurants. Steaks were delivered in juicy perfection. The incorporation of seafood into potato dishes were noteworthy, especially the crab gnocchi and lobster mac and cheese. There wasn't anything else the chef could've done to improve these dishes.

These were the items selected by our table:

Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ***
Roasted Brussels Sprouts **
Lobster Mashed Potatoes ***
Bone-In Filet ***12oz
Filet ***12oz
Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese ***
Clam Chowder **

*   don't bother
**  average/good enough
*** exceptional

Not realizing that we had ordered more than enough food for our small party, we opted to take the rest home, which the waitstaff briskly took care of and within minutes, returned with all of the food packaged in their own individual black to-go boxes with the Mastro's sticker label affixed to the top and neatly arranged in a shopping bag. 

Bathrooms were supplied with an assortment of items found in medicine cabinets had personal effects like Tums, men's cologne and mouthwash and someone to hand you a paper towel to dry your hands with. Again, Michelin-star quality without the Michelin-star price. 

Best $350 spent in Vegas. Worthwhile for a beautiful night out to impress your significant other, client or, perhaps, to just have the best fine dining experience in Sin City."}
{"text":"Wow... My husband and I went to to Mastro's Ocean Club to celebrate my birthday.  Being from Florida we are use to fresh, delicious seafood and really looked forward to our visit as great seafood is hard to find in the desert.  Our server was prompt and extremely well versed in the menu.   Great beef, wagu, lots and lots of butter on everything and of course, superb, fresh seafood. OK.  We decided on a sampling of the fresh oysters to start with then split a Caesar salad and both chose the wild salmon for entrees with the roasted Brussels sprouts for a vegi.  The oysters were amazing, fresh and delicious.  The salad was mediocre at best.  The salmon was the most surprising.  Dry to the bone.  Seriously, a restaurant that raves about the seafood it serves but totally clueless about the proper temp to serve it is unacceptable.  The sprouts were good but too much butter.  For dessert we chose the pecan pie.  Yikes. Grainy with a thick dry crust.  Seriously.  What happened to pecans floating in a delicious, gooey custard like filling.  
Very dissapointed.  We'll stick to Binkley's for special occasions."}
{"text":"I came here last week for dinner and was very satisfied. Our server was extremely professional and gave us his presentation of the menu very well, no questions were left unanswered. For such a large party (There were ten of us) drinks and wine came in a timely manner, only one drink took a little longer which the manager delivered himself and apologized for. We ordered two giant seafood towers with jumbo shrimp, lobster claws, crab legs, and split lobster tails. We took our servers recommendation on how many of each we would need to accommodate our party and he didn't over do it to try and up sell more than we needed. (Very impressed by this) The seafood was amazingly fresh and considering there is no ocean nearby it's actually the best I have had in Arizona. We all ordered steak, which all came out at perfect temperatures. I ordered the Bone In Ribeye medium plus which was juicy and tender with a nice light char. They use swarm service here for larger parties which was nice for delivery of food and pick up, but a little crowded since half of us were up against a wall. The only thing I didn't like was that they served our sides for us and I literally got one bite of each side which was just thrown by my steak. Dessert came and our server recommended a trio so everybody could have enough. It came with thier famous buttercake, a GIANT chocolate layer cake and a key lime pie centered with ice cream and whip cream! Delicious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant's in Las Vegas.  Everything here is pretty much perfect.  Top notch food, service and a great atmosphere. Mastro's is an excellent choice after a show or for a special occasion.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and the service is top excellent.  However, the price is high $14.00 for a basic cocktail.  Great location.

The disappointing thing about the Ocean club is the clientele,  the bar area has a band, live music is always nice but it's the meat market, club scene that detracts from the class of Ocean Club not to mention indiscreet solicitation is an open and notorious activity.  This not a place to take your family for dinner, definitely adult only."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern,
This is the worst dinning experience my wife and I have ever endured!  The evening was a special anniversary that was a complete let down with service, atmosphere and quality of dishes. From BAD placement, to RUDE servers and in the middle a very apologetic manager offering to move us from the table which was next to the buss boy/server station, where they made comments about the dinning guests and used foul language. To start the evening, we where staying at THE HOTEL and I had called ahead for reservations and informed the receptionist that it was a special occasion.On arriving  the young lady/Maitre d asked if it was a special evening and after answering YES she states she has a very special table for us! She then placed us next to the servers station when the restaurant was empty. The waiter came to our table and was RUDE, the food was HORRIBLE/ SUB PAR , we had the halibut special and the whole evening was one we will try to forget. We live in Paradise Valley, Az. and have been to the Mastro's  and Ocean Club here. I WARN everyone this Las Vegas restaurant is nothing like the others STAY AWAY. SPEND your money somewhere else. So SAD !!"}
{"text":"I am usually a four star reviewer.  If the food is good and the server is attentive, that is good enough for me.

5 Stars are for the rare occasions both the food and server are over the top good.  Mastro was both.  First Mastro is in the middle of the almost new City Center construction project and mausoleum for the lost profits of Dubai and the MGM Group.  It is a really nice place filled with shops people can no longer afford.

Mastro from the outside looks like a brown tree house in this glitzy cloud.  It is a really beautiful build out with a long and a two dining areas, one in the tree house and one outside said house.

It is a traditional steakhouse with tons of cuts of cow cooked to your liking and ubiquitous sides:  4 different types of spuds, veggies, etc.  I do not eat steak, but most of these places will have one chicken dish and really decent seafood.

I ordered the salad, scallops and split the sweet potato fries.  The salad was huge and could have/should have been the meal, especially after the  box of 6 kinds of different breads.  The scallops really excelled with a Parmesan flavoring, but the hit was my friends Arctic Char, which was perfect....and I mean perfect

Where is there fish that good in a desert?

The waiter was excellent and goaded us into dessert.  We asked him about the Praline Vs House Special Batter Cake.  He said try one as they were his favorite.  He would let us try the other.  Both were phenomenal....

As is this place....Really great food and total culinary experience"}
{"text":"Been to the one in Beverly Hills and now here. Great spot. Similar steaks to deal fricsos. Order martinis at the the bar. You pay for one but get 3-4 out of them! Bone in filet is epic."}
{"text":"We've wanted to have dinner here for a while, the structure of this restaurant is really cool.  We got to sit in the treehouse, which was really cool.  However i found the music to be a bit loud, but that may be because they had a full house, and therefore 
the music had to be loud to overcome the conversations?  

Our waiter was awesome, i cannot remember his name...he told us about the 32oz Australian Waygu tomahawk chop, and he had us hooked.  Thank you fellow yelpers for telling me that the portions here were huge.  So we decided to skip appetizers and go straight to the beef.  Oh boy was there a lot of beef.  The sides were also awesome, mac and cheese and mushrooms, they split our tomahawk and everything so that we didn't have to do it.  

Our waiter recommended the butter cake, oh my goodness...it is a whole lot of cake, and it was so yummy...so glad we skipped the appetizers or we never would have finished this dessert.  

We will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a really fun night out - the steak is served on a sizzle plate in a beautiful pool of butter. The last time I came the cocktails come with a shaker with maybe 2 refills in it (whaaa). And the piano player is crooning Jason Mraz songs, and the service is bright and sunny. You're sitting in a little wood bauble in the middle of a high end shopping mall and it's one of those \"only in Las Vegas\" sort of things."}
{"text":"The hottie and I headed to Mastro's Ocean Club on a weekend trip to Vegas.  A friend of mine has been pumping up Mastro's to me for years.  I ordered the bone in rib eye.... my favorite!  I would say that its not as good as Del Frisco's but still very good.  The hottie got the sea bass which was excellent.  We started off with fried calamari which was nothing special.  For sides we got creamed spinach which was pretty good and gorgonzola mac n cheese which was not good.  I'm not a big fan of gorgonzola from the start so it wasn't a surprise that I did not like it that much.  But the hottie is a big fan of gorgonzola and even she said it wasn't good.  We loved the tree house look and its a first class place.  We even saw Pete Rose there with a...... ahem companion.  Overall thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We went there for New Years and this place is so amazing!!! The food was very filling, waiters are friendly, they even gave us free glass bottles!!!! This is a great place to go for any special occasion or if you want to just eat at a fancy restaurant at any time."}
{"text":"5 star should be enough said but I will say everything about our visit on a simple Monday evening was absolute perfection. During our wait for our dining table in the lounge I found myself having a difficult time choosing a cocktail from their extensive list with a lengthy variety of cocktails but the live music was a nice bonus. I ended up with the Elder Flower Martini and the $19 cocktail ended up being an extremely generous portion including leaving the remainder amount in the shaker for me to enjoy which ended up bring another entire martini. I highly recommend our table as it was completely open to the outdoors with fabulous weather and a beautiful night view of the Tommy Bahama building with all the green and beautifully lit trees. The Australian Wagu beef was perfectly prepared and definitely enough for two. The sides were filled with flavor. Our concierge from our resort had our server send over their famous butter cake which we knew we were never going to be able to finish. However, one bite in and we were hooked, this cake alone is worth returning for and we will absolutely do that. Do not forget to top it with the homemade Chantilly cream. Oh my!!!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best steakhouse in LV. Our server was Tony and he really took the time to explain everything! Cannot wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how anyone can give less than 5 stats based off the food alone! But include the service and I'm at a 6.5 (if there were such a thing). So my mom, grandma,  and I were late for our 6:15 reso. I made the reso via open table letting them know it was my moms birthday and we'd like a table in the tree house. Even though we were late(double your travel time if its raining) they honored our table request! 

We started with 2 lemon drop martinis and a glass of white zin. The lemon martinis are no joke. The lemon flavor is PERFECT. Our sever Brandon(I think) explained that they infuse vodka with lemons to make the martinis. For apps we had bone marrow which was served with an arugula salad dressed with capers and escargot served with puff pastry. Both were PHENOMENAL. My 89 yo grandma killed the bone marrow! 

For our meal we shared sea scallops,  ribeye,  alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi, creamed corn, and mashed sweet potatoes. Everything was FANTASTIC!! The scallops were served in a garlic butter sauce with tomato and parm. I could have licked the bowl they were served in! Because we shared the ribeye it was sliced for us and we were supplied with tongs to serve ourselves(after the initial serving the manager and server helped serve). I loved how they served us our food!

You need to get the gnocchi. It is AMAZING. The creamed corn was fantastic too. Our service was fantastic. We ordered sparkling wine and our flutes were never empty. Timing of the courses was great. We finished our meal with chocolate layer cake and butter cake. Both were oh the house because it was my moms bday and because we're locals. I didn't care for the chocolate cake but the butter cake was good!! For all the items above including tax and 20+% tip we spent $140 per person. Pretty hefty but well worth it!"}
{"text":"I went there last night with bf to celebrate our anniversary. After pre-yelp, we knew what to expect as to prices, so it wasn't so much of a shocker.

To the food, we concur with almost everyone here. It was impeccable! We ordered the ice tower for 2 and thought that it was very well presented. Ours came with 3 appetizers (raw oysters, crab claws and dungeness crab) so it wasn't too high. They are all fresh. Growing up I used to go to the beach quite often just to have fresh crabs, so I know what those taste like. And for 6 years living in the desert, Mastro's is the first and only one in AZ to deliver that.  

For main course, I got Ivory Salmon \"Oreganata\", bf got Swordfish blackened. I am quite picky when it comes to fish, and bf isn't exactly a fish person, but both of our dishes \"surpassed expectation.\" I couldn't say much about swordfish except it was fresh. We had the same dish 2 weeks before at somewhere else, it was nowhere near as sweet and fresh as the one at Mastro's. It was my first having Ivory Salmon, it was sweeter, and white (hence the name) than normal salmon we get around here. Mine was good size portion, firm to the touch, but melted in the mouth. The flavor was subtle enough to enjoy by itself, or you can add one of the sauces provided. One of my favorite sauces of the night I think was made of minced tomatoes and olives, came with the main course.

Sides were Lobster Mash and Snap peas. I didn't really care for snap peas as I can make them at home. But lobster mash is a MUST for those who go there. I'm not sure how they prepared it, but it felt like mash potatoes made with lobster bisque (instead of water and milk) and added lobster chunks. It was much more flavorful and creamy than a normal mash potatoes. It was big enough to share and take home. One thing though, it hardened up after sitting out for awhile, so I'm not sure if microwave could make it all fluffy again after 1 night in the fridge.

Drinks there are amazing, from the presentation, to the taste, and definitely the amount of alcohol in each drink. We decided to go with cocktail drinks rather than wines because of other yelpers' reviews. Total worth it!!!

The service was amazing. We had Robert. We pretty much asked him for recommendations for everything, yet he was nice about it and very knowledgeable. Next time we go back, I would definitely ask for him again.

We didn't order dessert since they gave us a dark-chocolate \"Happy Anniversary\" cake with the letters written, also, in chocolate. The overall experience was 4 3/4, just because it was a bit difficult talking to each other. The acoustic of the room wasn't very good and it got loud. Didn't see much of cougar/manther scene as we were in the dining room. And maybe it was during weekdays, we saw lots of \"expense account\" people though"}
{"text":"if Jesus dined out, he would dine here and even HE would have to count calories. The food is AMAZING!! It was my husband's birthday, so we brought our appetites and we should've brought the deed to our house as well... more about that later. We had reservations and were seated promptly. Our server was Michael, a lovely gentleman and self -proclaimed foodie like us. We started with foie gras, Dungeness crab cocktail a dream berry and lemon drop. We ended with butter cake and key lime pie, in between was a New York strip Oscar style which was tender and flavorful in every bite. Halibut, more dream berry, and neat shots of glenlivet 15 year chased with pelligrino. No complaints whatsoever, but everything is a la carte and very rich, like maybe they should offer complementary heart surgery instead of after dinner mints rich. Not cheap, we left $717 lighter, tip not included but it was worth it to indulge and celebrate life.... while shortening it considerably. Eat up!"}
{"text":"bone in ribeye was good and seared well. Wasn't the most tender ribeye that I have had. Bone also wasn't that big for a $50 ribeye. I guess I am just a steak snob."}
{"text":"Outstanding...and I live at the ocean and love steak!

Not my first \"surf and turf\" experience, heck, not my first of the week but probably the BEST I've ever had.  We went with the live lobster table side shelled by Tanya and the bone in fillet.  Lobster cooked to perfection (not over cooked) and steak was so tender it cut with a fork.  Drinks and sides were also wonderful...house special lemon drop, crab and truffle gnocchi, twice baked potato and mushrooms.  WOW!

High end Vegas at its best.  Shops with million dollar dresses in the window surround and live \"Vegas style entertainment\" abounds.  Definitely highly recommended (and the ONLY five star review I've even written on Yelp!).*

*((edit: ok at the time the only fiver I had given...found you need to do fives sometimes to bring up the average from the unwashed...sorry to be misleading in anyway ';-))"}
{"text":"I have been to the Mastro's in Los Angeles and when I saw the Ocean Club at the City Center in Las Vegas - I have to say I was a bit taken a back. Do not get me wrong reader - here is this amazing bird's nest modern structure that looks like it should be in a museum somewhere....nested in a MALL. Given the shops were all upscale. But still, a MALL to say the least. It had that new mall smell that you'll just never get out of your clothes. It left me wondering what the restaurant and atmosphere would be like during dinner service. Well, I didn't have to wonder. My group had planned a bachelorette dinner for the lucky bride to be. 

Staff - These people are pros. Seriously, every person works together like a well oiled machine. We had a group of nine girls, which is not easy but I'm sure they see that pretty often. It is Vegas. And the service was fantastic. Our waiter and the whole wait staff was really great and accommodating. Our reservations were at 745pm and we had to be out of there by 915pm to catch our ride. They were so mindful of that the whole time, but also didn't take away from the experience. 

The meal - What can I say about the food that has not already been said? Pretty much nothing - so I'll just reinforce what my fellow yelpers have been saying the whole time - it's amazing. I ordered the salmon and one of the other girls ordered a fillet and we shared both plates. Both cooked perfectly. For sides - Lobster mashed potatoes, regular mashed potatoes and asparagus. All delicious. 

The whole experience was wonderful. And I had serious reservations about what this was going to entail when I walked in. But Mastro's did not disappoint. I enjoyed stepping back and being able to compare my experience in LA to Vegas. And although each restaurant had their similarities whether it be with the menu or just how the staff serves you, both restaurants still had a their own uniqueness which made each experience stand out."}
{"text":"OverAll food was pretty good I felt the ribeye should had more flavor but everything else was awesome I wouldn't mind going back"}
{"text":"The most amazing meal and because of Paul our waiter, it made it even better. Very fresh, delicious cuisine and excellent service.   Love this place and always looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"No doubt a popular venue as judged by our wait even after we had a reservation. 

Ate my usual bone in filet and was utterly disappointed. In fact I was underwhelmed by every dish that came out.  

I guess I should have gotten the seafood?"}
{"text":"A client gave me a $250 gift card to Mastro's or else we never would have gone someplace like this. I read all the Yelp reviews and quickly got very nervous.  People either loved or hated Ocean Club. Filter out the ones that complain about the noise though - they were obviously sitting in the lounge, which was super loud.  We sat in the dining room and it was restaurant-quiet the entire time.  But even after filtering out the noise complaints and the people who obviously had an axe to grind with a particular server, the remaining bad reviews were about the food.  This concerned me greatly.  If you're going to pay that much, the food better be delicious and cooked to perfection.  I can tell you that our entire was just that.

Our reservation was at 5pm which is when the dining room opens. Everyone was super friendly and professional starting with the check-in people. We got a nice table by one of the huge windows and a view of the other shops.  The trees outside had christmas lights which turned on at 5:30 and then about 6pm they opened the windows.  

Our server was attentive, professional & courteous.  I cannot stress how incredible the service was.  Our waiter walked us through the menu and instantly many of the questions that had been bugging me were answered.  They started us with a bread basket which had normal rolls, garlic toast wedges and pretzel bread.  I could have eaten an entire dinner of just the pretzel bread.  We love shrimp cocktail and even though Mastro's is famous for it's Seafood Tower, there was no way the two of us could eat that AND have dinner so we just got the $23 shrimp cocktail...which was the coolest thing ever.  4 tasty, mammoth shrimp as big as my hand with spicy, but not-too-spicy cocktail sauce, served over dry ice so the smoke filtered over the table.  My wife got the $8 Small Chopped Salad which she loved and I got the $12 Boston Clam Chowder which was as good or better than any clam chowder I've ever had.  We came for the seafood but my wife wanted a steak.  Our waiter suggested getting the Filet Oscar-style, stuffed with Dungeness Crab and Bearnaise sauce.  Even though the prices seemed astronomical, this was our anniversary and my wife happily agreed.  The 8oz Filet was $51 and the Dungeness Crab topping was another $32.  That's $83 for one steak.  We couldn't believe it....until she tasted it.  It was cooked perfectly with huge chunks of crab in and over it.  I was almost wishing I had gotten the same thing until I dug into my 1lb King Crab Legs for $67.  Ever so briefly, I was a little dissapointed when they came out and saw there were only 2 legs.  Then I saw how massive they were.  Delicious with a hint of sweetness I've never tasted in crab legs before.  

The sides are a-la-cart, and come in 2 sizes - Small or Family.  Our waiter suggested the small sizes for us, which I kind of doubted but was proven wrong.  It was nice that he didn't try to get us to order more than we needed as a few other reviewers experienced.  We got the $20 Lobster Mashed Potatoes which are their signature side, and well worth it.  The lobster was wonderful and not at all chewy like other reviewers experienced.  We also got the $8 Gorgonzolla Mac & Cheese which came out on a skillet and perfectly baked.  The last side was the $7 Grilled Asparagus.  Everything was amazing.  

My wife got Diet Coke and they bring it out in the little 12oz bottles.  She went through 4 of them at $5 a piece and we couldn't have cared less.  The wait staff was incredibly attentive.  Drinks never got more than halfway finished before being refilled.  

Our waiter told us he had a complimentary chocolate cake for us but we told him we also had to try the $16 Warm Butter Cake which was huge, with an equally huge scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle.  We must have spent a good 30 minutes on the butter cake alone.

For a full dinner you've got to prepare yourself for at least a 2 hour dining experience.  Possibly longer with alcohol and coffee.  We were there 2 hours and honestly it flew by.  Our water told us it would be 25 minutes between soup/salad and entree and it was, but it didn't feel like it at all.  

The bill came to $295.39 with the comped chocolate cake and after the $250 gift card, $45.39. We always tip at least 20% no matter where we go so we added a $65 tip for a total of $110.39.  That's just under what we routinely spend on our anniversary dinner at The Salt Cellar.  So for us, in this instance, it worked out perfect.

So I'm forced to ask myself if I would feel the same way with a $350 bill.  It's hard to answer that, because I would never pay $300+ for a dinner for 2.  And if I wanted to, my wife would have a very hard time with it.  So - no, I do not think it was worth $350 for a normal dinner.  But that's not the point, it wasn't a normal dinner.  It was a very special occasion dinner.  Will we do it again next year?  Probably not.  Maybe for our 25th anniversary though."}
{"text":"Mike was our waiter and he could not have been more enjoyable or knowledgeable. 

Thank you, Mike, for taking our dinner from fun to a five-star blast! 

We expected nothing short of delicious food and drink, and that too was delivered. 

The Mastro's team has much to be proud of. Well done!"}
{"text":"Ate here for a work event.  One of the better meals I've had on the strip.  Especially impressive because it was a set-menu event for 20+ people. That scenario usually doesn't enable a restaurant to truly shine as they have to fire so many plates simultaneously.  I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"My favorite place for seafood. All the fish is extremely fresh , great bar and attentive servers.  You will be happy you tried it."}
{"text":"We had our first company dinner here and it was absolutely amazing!!!! We got a private room for a party of about 25-30 people. The food the service the ambiance was incredible!! I wish we got the room in the funky looking boat thingy but eh i ain't complaining. 

We had selected menus from the choices we voted on as a company. The food came out promptly and it looked like something out of a magazine. The food was amazing. The side dishes were incredible as well (: They catered to our every needs no matter how silly it was hahah ^^"}
{"text":"I am going to make this review short and to the point.  You should come here.  The food and drinks are superb, the wait staff are very friendly and attentive and the restaurant is amazing.  Worth the money for sure.
Get on it people."}
{"text":"I frequent the Ocean Club a lot.  The food AND management is the best and exactly what I would expect at a high-class venue as Ocean Club is.  The bar staff (my favorite is Cindy) is extremely professional and Nick (the GM) is one of the best I've seen at any restaurant."}
{"text":"My main course was the Chilean Sea Bass - - it turned out to be the best prepared Chilean Sea Bass I've ever had...simply incredible.  Sides:  lobster mashed potatoes - amazing.  Scalloped potatoes - near perfection  Other sides were slightly above average.  Lobster Bisque was very flavorful, but needed more lobster in it.  Shrimp cocktail had large succulent shrimp.  Private dinning room waitress and support staff were as professional as they come.  Overall a great dinning experience."}
{"text":"***Short version of this review***

Mastro's is the Cheesecake Factory of fine dining.

--------------------------------------------------------

***Long version of this review***

I dropped by Mastro's in the Crystals mall for a quick dinner before a night on the town.  I'd heard of the Mastro's chain before, especially their swanky steakhouses in Orange County and LA, but this was my first time hearing of their seafood restaurant.  It seemed like the perfect opportunity to lose my Mastro's virginity without being subjected to massive slabs of red meat.

First thing's first -- Mastro's is enormous, and it's absolutely stunning.  In terms of architectural design, this place is a feast for the eyes.  The interior of the restaurant is bold and stunning.  Much of the dining room is suspended over the rest of the mall in a giant wooden \"treehouse\".  I sat at the bar, which was a veritable mountain of mirrors and glass.  Just being at Mastro's feels glamorous.

After being seated, I ordered a glass of the \"Grace Lane\" Riesling (which was fabulous) and was promptly offered a complementary breadbasket, filled with pretzel bread, toasted baguette, and various other goodies.  

I noticed that most of the plates being carted around the restaurants were pretty large, so I decided to build a dinner out of two different appetizers.  I opted for the sauteed sea scallops and the ahi tuna tostada.

Needless to say, two appetizers were more than enough food, since these so-called \"appetizers\" were really entree portions.  The sea scallops included 3 giant scallops, soaking in a rich and buttery sauce and served alongside huge slabs of cheesy baguette.  The ahi tuna tostada was actually 3 separate tostadas, each loaded to the hilt with big-eye tuna, avocado, and ponzu chili sauce.

Of the two dishes, I preferred the scallops, which were simply prepared and oh so silky and indulgent.  The ahi tuna tostada was less enjoyable, since the tuna was served warm and had a slightly mealy consistency.  

Service was efficient, formal, and bland -- fairly typical for a chain restaurant, but especially a Vegas chain restaurant.  

All in all, I'd really glad I had the chance to experience Mastro's for the first time.  The behemoth portions, straightforward food, and stiff service felt like Cheesecake Factory -- not a bad place per se, but not somewhere that I'd visit on the reg, either."}
{"text":"Yummy! This place was fantastic from the moment we stepped inside. The decor, wait staff, food...absolutely top notch! Our waiter knew exactly what he was talking about and explained the dishes to us in detail without any hesitation. We ordered an order of regular caesar salad and the spicy mambo caesar salad to start, which were very good. The spicy mambo version had wasabi in it so it definately had a a great kick. I had the sea scallops which were sauteed and drenched in a luxuriously creamy white sauce....absolutely divine! I can still taste it in my mouth! LOL. Hubby ordered the sea bass which was really tender as well. Overall had a very nice, last night in Scottsdale and I would recommend this place for a nice, romantic, elegant evening out!"}
{"text":"Great filet.  Wonderful service.  Big portions.  My lobster was overcooked, but other than that, it was good."}
{"text":"Five stars all the way :) 
My boyfriend and I came here for our one month anniversary, and it was an incredible dining experience. He ordered the Filet, and I ordered to Chilean sea bass. Both were cooked to perfection. We got the gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the salt and vinegar fries. The mac and cheese was EXTREMELY cheesy, so order it only if you love cheese. Our server was fantastic, and gave us a FREE buttercake topped with ice cream for our anniversary! 


TIPS
- Get the lemon drop! It was delicious, and so worth it because there is enough for two full glasses. 
- If with a small party, ask the server if he can make the sides half sizes. i had no idea they could do that, but our server did it for us. (And we still had leftovers!) 
- Sit in the reehouse"}
{"text":"Place is incredible    They have terrific music mid week through weekend.  Not overpowering music but good bands that you can still talk with those around you.  

Place gets pretty busy so plan ahead."}
{"text":"Snow-birds to your left and burnt tourists to your right, Mastro's Ocean Club is definitely a hit place for visitors. Live jazz at night in the loud bar area and an open airy atmosphere in the dining area. Started off with the crab cakes which were superb. I ordered the recommended Chilean Sea Bass and was quite impressed. The lobster mashed potatoes were very delicious, and of course the lobster was gone in a second. Very fancy and expensive place, quite the hoopla if I do say so myself.. I mean, is it necessary to have a woman in the bathroom help you wash your hands? I guess if you need your hair done mid meal, this would be ideal... but I mean c'mon people... or shall I say c'mon tourists. What I'm trying to say is that this place is quite the trendy place to be seen... with perfectly cooked fish and $35 potatoes."}
{"text":"I love this place! 

My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our 6 months semi-anniversary and we certainly had a great time! The only down side is it burnt a hole in our wallet. But it is a special occasion and we both think it is worth it. 

I made a reservation on line at open table and I mentioned our occasion. When we were at the hostess stand, we were greeted by our last name which really surprised me. We waited for about 2 min before we got seated in the tree house, just like how I requested in my reservation. Our server came right away to take our drink orders and also gave us some recommendations. 

We decided to go with the Surf and Turf they have which comes with a 3 pound Maine Lobster and steak of our choice. One thing about the meal here is that it does not come with any sides. You only get what you order. If you want to have mashed potatos or onion rings, you do have to order them seperately which again raises the cost. 

The food came fairly fast after we ordered and the busser divided the meal for us right by the table. The lobster tasted great so did the steak! The server was telling us that they have a live fishtank in the back and all the lobsters they have came in daily directly from Maine! You can't get anything fresher than that in Vegas! The steak is flavorful and juicy. My boyfriend said it could be more tender. As for the side, we ordered Scalloped potatoes and Corossal Onion Rings. We both like the potatoes it was yummy but not too impressed by the Onion Rings, for some reason it tastes a bit soft. 

Upon we were finishing up our meal, so stuffed at that point, our server actually surprised us with a complimentary desert for our celebration! What a nice gesture! So definitely put in the occasion if you are celebrating anything at Mastro's! 

The environment is elegant and classy with live performance. It is expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. We return on our next special occasion."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of beef or as I like to call it \"MEAF\" (meat + beef) then you need to go to Mastro's.  This is the second time I've eaten at Mastro's; the other was in Orange County, CA.

This is a place where you want to burn your money and empty your wallet.  Why not waste it on fine food instead of strippers and gambling.  This venue in the new Crystals City Center is a little small, but the atmosphere and location is excellent as it sits over the ledge with a great view.  A sexy live singer and a pianist playing the tunes of some 60's through 90's music.  

I ordered a medium rare 22 oz Bone in Ribeye for dinner and a side of Sauteed Asparagus.  The main entrée does not come with any free side orders.  Side orders are priced separately.  I didn't have to wait too long for my Ribeye as the service was excellent.  The beef was perfectly prepared and no need to add any additional seasoning.  However, I always like my food spicy so I asked for some Tabascco.  The Asparagus was ok as it complimented with my meal.

The food is exceptional for the price.  But don't buy too many drinks there as it does get expensive.  Great place to hang out and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my girlfriend and her friend for her friends birthday. The oysters were amazing but the rest of the crab and lobster was NOT. it tasted very fishy and not fresh. Every time I have gone here before I have had an incredible experience and tonight I was very disappointed with the food. The steak was not prepared well. I will not be returning to Mastro's again and I am honestly very disappointed ."}
{"text":"We dined here just this past Monday 9/21/15.  My boyfriend and I wanted to treat his parents to a \"fancy\" evening, and let me tell you it was nothing short of fantastic! Paul (our server) was beyond knowledgeable and added so much more to our fun.  My boyfriend's mom even tried the escargot, (after much prodding) but ended up really enjoying it.  If I could I would come back 3 times a week.  Definitely save room for the Butter Cake, all of us being over-stuffed still ate the entire thing without complaints :)  They do have a more expensive spread but it is more than worth the splurge. Double date with the parents was a huge success, thanks Paul! ABSOLUTELY  ASK FOR PAUL... HE ROCKS!"}
{"text":"I do not get the great reviews this place is getting. Main course was awful. The restaurants in Orange County & LA are so much better then this.

I was there Friday May 4th with a group of 20 people. I thought it would be amazing since it is Mastro's after all. It was the opposite. Good service, but food was so so. My twin lobsters were so over cooked. It was tough & crunchy. I ate half of one & gave up. Felt bad not to eat it, but it was awful. I eat lobster all of the time & it's supposed to melt in your mouth. That was not the case here. The rest of my group ordered filet mignon & they were all complaining as well. Over cooked & chewy is what I was told. The shrimp cocktail was fine. The oysters were ok. The asparagus wasn't good. The cremed corn was good. The alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi was excellent. The creme brulee was great. But, I would never go there again. Unless you are in the wooden dome seating area it fells like you're just eating at the food court in the mall. Not what I expected. Save your money please & go to STK in the Cosmo or Joe's at Caesars. The lobster is to die for."}
{"text":"As a newer Yelper, this is only my second review and beyond deserved.  On our most recent trip to Las Vegas last weekend, my boyfriend and I ended up unexpectedly at Mastro's Ocean Club in Crystals inside City Center for the first time.  We go to Vegas quite a bit (about once every 2 months or so) and have passed by this place quite a few times.  

The interestingly constructed architecture of the main dining area has been quite the source of amusement to us in the past... it resembles something like the shell of a wooden submarine that has exit chutes above and below it to spit you out into Crystals when you are done with your meal (btw, this is a joke.  You do not get ejected from your seat.  It is only my strange sense of humor that comes up with this stuff).  My imaginative uses for the architecture aside, the design/layout is nice; it makes you feel as if the restaurant is floating in the middle of Crystals with a very open and airy feel.

As we were walking through Crystals on our way back to our hotel room at Aria from a long day of shopping, we decided to make an impromptu stop at the ejection submarine and see if there was any chance they would take us as walk-ins on a busy Friday night.  With it being such an upscale spot, I was sure we would either be turned away without a reservation or asked to wait for a ridiculous amount of time.  Au contraire!  They offered us immediate seating in the bar/lounge area or a few minute wait for the main dining room.  Since we felt a bit underdressed for the location, we opted for the bar/lounge area and were glad we did.  We had the perfect seat right next to the piano player and fiery red-headed chanteuse, who was pleasantly entertaining. 

We were promptly greeted by our amazing server, Sara.  The only reason I know her name is because I made sure to ask her for it when we were leaving as I knew I wanted to review this place.  Sara was so attentive, knowledgeable about menu, friendly, and always two steps ahead of us -  really as perfect as a server can get.  All of her recommendations were great as well.

I had the swordfish (I hadnt met my mercury quota for the month yet) and my boyfriend had the bone-in Ribeye.  We shared the most delicious side dish - the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi.  My swordfish paired very well with gnocchi and it was the perfect combo of light and creamy.  However, my boyfriend's Ribeye wasnt anything stellar.  It wasnt as flavorful as a most quality Ribeyes should be.  It's on our do-not-order-again list.  This is an \"Ocean Club\" though so maybe that was his error for ordering one of the few non-seafood options.  Now,  for the absolute BEST part of the meal.... THE MOST HEAVENLY DESSERT EVER - Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Even if the rest of the meal and service had been horrible, which it was far from, I would have given this place 5 stars just for this dessert!  I dreamt about this cake the rest of our stay in Vegas and cant wait to go back again on our next trip just to have it.  This creation alone makes Mastro's Ocean Club one of my top 5 all-time favorite restaurants.  I would happily get ejected from this sea-faring vessel any time! ;)

Sorry for the ridiculously long review, but I had so much to comment on and didnt know where to shorten it."}
{"text":"Ah finally! Mastro's is a chain that is throughout CA and a few other states. I have been wanting to go for awhile now but the Vegas location is byfar the prettiest and in the middle of the City Center. The staff was super generous and allowed us to delay our reservation time a few times and still had a table for us. I have been looking forward to these infamous lobster mashed potatoes for awhile as I have only had them once before as leftovers. IT WAS AMAZING! I'm still dreaming about them now... It had a perfect consistency of creaminess and flavor with large pieces of lobster. I had the Chilean Sea bass for my main entree along with the mashed potatoes and mushrooms on the side. The Sea bass had perfect consistency and was huge in portion. It was flaky and cooked perfectly. For dessert, we had the butter cake which was overbuttered in my opinion but was topped off with a fresh homemade whipped cream and ice cream."}
{"text":"Great steaks cooked perfectly to temp and the seasoning was spot on.

Bone In Rib Eye - see above
King Crab leg - fresh , can't really screw this up if it's fresh
Oysters - same review as the crab legs
Gnochi with King Crab & Truffle - delicious side dish

Great wine selection and atmosphere.  I would give a more in depth review but a little too hungover, my palate was not firing on all cylinders.  But I do remember it tasted really good."}
{"text":"He always said we should have a nice proper steak dinner.  But every single time I'm in town, we end up skipping the whole steak thing.  But this time, his boyfriend had a client to impress, so we off we went on a steak dinner.  Yay me!

Anyhow, since it is rare back home in Honolulu to find a filet with bone in, that's what they got.  Myself, because my eating habits have changed (boo!!) I opted for the petite filet.  I know, sad, right?  I got 8 ounces of meat!  Not the 12 ounces they ordered.  I got my meat rare, cold center, hot plate.  Mmmm I just love a good piece of meat especially when you can control how you're gonna receive it.  I got it just the way I want it, which is actually hard to come by.  I'll take it the way I want it.  He says out loud, \"you think you know a person,\" when I ordered my meat rare.  Oh, honey, you've known me for how many years now, and you still don't know how I like my meat?  As rare as can be is how I like it and I got a true piece of meat perfection.  You know that I ate all of it!  I love me some meat!

The rest of the dishes were typical.  Salads, soups, sides were just regular, nothing extraordinarily spectacular to really write about.  The portions for those items are generous, I must say.  We did order a bottle of wine to go with dinner.  I think it was a shiraz.  I didn't pick it out, but it did go well with dinner.  And since it was their birthday, there was dessert.  Not 1, but 2, since two of them were celebrating.  One was a butter cake and the other a chocolate cake.  How nice, right?  We couldn't finish the desserts, but I must say they were very rich and of course yummy.

Would I return again?  Most definitely!  It's good that this place was a nice walk from our hotel.  I sure am glad that they are open late, since my eating habits were out of wack.  I love me some meat!!"}
{"text":"Gosh this structure sure is beautiful in the middle of the mall at ARIA.  I was in Las Vegas on a double date with my neighbor and his girlfriend for my partner's birthday.  At the tail end of our trip we had reservations for Mastro's Ocean Club.  It was pretty grand, let me tell you.

The service is simply superior.  You're not going to get a higher class feeling, especially for being inside a mall.

We had the lobster mashed potatoes and onion rings for the table (the onion rings were AMAZING), and we each ordered a different drink (personally, I ordered Dragon Fire, which was tequila with all sorts of sweets and a jalapeno topping).  

Our main meals were all impressive in their own ways.  I ordered the lamb, which was simple and delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, which was cooked to his perfection and would've rated this place 5 starts.  My neighbor ordered the ribeye, and was displeased with the outcome.  My neighbor ordered medium rare for his ribeye, and my partner ordered medium-well for his filet mignon (because he will NEVER eat bloody meat), and my neighbor's ribeye was much more well cooked than the filet mignon.  My neighbor's experience was lackluster, but TRUST ME, had my neighbor said something to the server immediately it would've been fixed ASAP.  My neighbor didn't want to make a big deal, so he just said something at the end of the meal that it was okay, and he ate it, but he wasn't happy with it because of how well it was done.  The server was very apologetic and took the ribeye off our bill.  His girlfriend had the mussels, and she thought they were good but wasn't floored by the textxure.

Mastro's was great, but this is definitely one of the restaurants I go to once because I don't want to have another meal while watching ostentatious women picking out what they want at Balenciaga across the way with a perfect view.  It was annoying."}
{"text":"Vegas one was overrated. Food was ehhhh. I have happily paid more for better steaks, gosh, maybe just an off day, not saying it was Tads - LOL - but it was not in the top ten steak places that I would recommend. Service was ok, food ok, it was an ok experience....Beverly Hills was 4-5 stars, just ehhh"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Bone marrow was amazing. Be careful, your eyes maybe bigger than your stomach"}
{"text":"I love Mastro's! I have been to the one in Cali, Vegas, AZ, and IL. All are them are the same, exceptional service with exceptional food.  My husband and I have had dinner in the middle of the treetop last year at this location, this year we just stopped in for a little snack.  We had the shrimp cocktail at the bar and it was outstanding. I loved their Moscow mule and my husband was very happy with his vodka martini chilled with caper berries. When we sat in the treetop, we had an amazing dining experience as well. 


You can't go wrong with seafood or steak when dining at a Mastro's. They are always worth a quick stop if you are looking to spoil yourself with the best."}
{"text":"Whoa... Don't waste your time or money. There are far too many fantastic choices in Vegas to come here. Shockingly horrible food experience we had for our pre Christmas dinner last Sunday. I do NOT recommend coming here. I can't believe we paid $270 for a mediocre meal... what a disappointment. Fail Mastro's Vegas! Again, I highly, suggest spending your money somewhere else. The one star that I gave them was for, Dalan, our awesome server. 

Now, I have been to Mastro's in OC about a dozen times and it has never failed me but in Las Vegas it was a major let down. What happened?! If anything, I expected more out of the Las Vegas location. We ordered:

1. Shrimp cocktail
2. Wagu 8oz. Steak $98
3. Gorgonzola mac and cheese
4. Creamed spinach
4. Creamed corn 
5. Key lime pie

The shrimp cocktail was the best thing my boyfriend had, served with their house cocktail sauce. The Wagu steak was cooked medium but was the texture of a pork chop. Unlike the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness they boast of. The Mastro's in OC  Wagu steak was cooked to perfection so I have something to compare it to. Fail Mastro's Las Vegas. The Gorgonzola Mac and cheese was missing salt, it was rather bland. The creamed corn was a bit watery, unlike its usual creamy consistency. The corn was also mushy, probably over cooked. That is always a favorite but they seamed to mess that one up too. The creamed spinach was rich but tolerable. Aside from the shrimp cocktail and key lime pie, the dinner was meh.

Update: 5/24/15 
Mastro's reached out to me shortly after our visit but I somehow missed their attempt. After four months of not seeing their message, I immediately called back and spoke to the manager last Saturday. He apologized for our experience and told me that the GM would give me back a call on Sunday... Well, a week later and I hear crickets. No missed calls or messages. Nothing. Wow, this is an even bigger let down. The second fail requires that I update my review... Mastro's kitchen, staff (ie. Management) clean up your act.  I'd take away that one star if I could."}
{"text":"Great service, great steaks. Felt like i was dining in a ufo pod of some kind. Mastro's definitely operates at 10 out of 10 level"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots to eat & go on a date with my girl. Excellent service and the food is amazing, slightly pricey but I won't hold that against them."}
{"text":"Freakin' Awesome!!! I have never had another steak like at Mastro's. I don't normally eat seafood but when I was here I had tried the crab legs and they were super tender and buttery and succulent. They serve these huge crab legs that are already split and cracked so you don't have to spend an hour trying to suck a little piece of meat out of the shell. 

My steak was ridiculously good, medium-well filet mignon, I don't even have words to explain it because I start to stttttuudder, it was that good. The Gorgonzola mac and cheese was excellent, I wish we would have taken our left over mac but we were in Vegas and we weren't going back to our hotel room right after dinner.  The mushrooms were soooo good, nice meaty mushrooms, I believe they were shittake shrooms.  Bread basket was awesome, all kinds of different breads to snack on. 

Ordered a vodka 7up and dang was that strong. The waiters were super nice and you feel like royalty when you dine here. I would definitely suggest Mastro's."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. I truly cannot say enough good things about this restaurant as the service was impeccable and the food was outstanding. Highlights for us were the shrimp cocktail, caesar salad, sea bass, big eye tuna and button mushrooms. We also enjoyed the classic martini which was perfection and came with a hefty \"extra\" shaker serving. Everything was truly outstanding and worth every penny. The portions are huge though, so keep that in mind when ordering. They offer half portions of all sides which was a nice touch. The server timed everything perfectly and I can't think of one misstep during our entire 3+ hour meal."}
{"text":"We live close to the ocean club in Newport Coast where we've eaten several times and is always perfect. While in Vegas staying at the Aria we had a group here for dinner and basically ate the menu (bill was almost 4000).  Everything was pretty good but the steak was probably the worst I've ever had.  I ordered a bone in filet which was almost $60 which was fatty and undercooked (ordered medium rare).  Didn't send it back because I wasn't interested in eating more food since we had so many appetizers and we had desserts coming. I'm just surprised that any Mastro's would send a piece of meat of that quality not properly cooked for that price.  You guys are better than that..."}
{"text":"Update: August 2017:

Back again with the wife to celebrate her birthday.  The food and service here was excellent as usual.  

Last time we ordered too much and didn't have room for dessert.

This time we ordered a Mambo Salad (basically a spicy Cesar salad with a wasabi dressing), the Chilean Sea Bass, and repeated on the Rack of Lamb and the Sweet sugar peas.

For dessert we had cappuccinos and since it was the wife's birthday they gave her chocolate cake! Sweeet!

Our server Kim was great and very helpful.  Excellent suggestions on the Sea Bass and Mambo Salad and thank you for the birthday cake!

Still a five star dining experience!



Christmas Season 2016:

I love this place!  The wife and I have been here several times. The food is great. The atmosphere is unique.  Always ask to be seated in the treehouse!

Today we are here for dinner and we had the rack of lamb, the Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna and several sides.  

They start with a bread basket of several types.  I personally love the pretzel bread

The lamb was medium and perfect.  A nice char on the outside and moist and tender in the inside.  Standard presentation of a lamb \"drum stick\"

The tuna was barely seared and sashimi grade; served over a bed of carrots, onions, and celery with a beer and soy sauce. Served with wasabi and ginger. Great presentation.

Sides...mac and cheese, sweet sugar peas, and the garlic mashed potatoes.  Helpful hint - they actually offer a smaller serving size on sides (not on the menu).  

No room for dessert today.

5 stars as always."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! The food was awesome and the service was simply amazing. We had a group of 8 and we honestly felt like we were the only people in the building. Our cups were never empty and our bellies were full. Huge portions of food as well. Definitely a must visit when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best food I have ever had in my life. Very pricey but that is expected in a high end mall on the strip. Love this so much and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I'm from California and every time I visit Arizona I have to make a stop here. The ambiance is very nice and classy and located in a great/fun area. The bar and drinks are great and the food is fantastic. Like i said, I'm from California and live in the Bay Area, so I thought I knew what great seafood was - wrong! Who knew that the desert had better (well almost better) seafood than San Francisco or Monterey Bay?  

I had the Vanilla Battered Sole with Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese - Amazing! Never tasted anything like that - I recommend that this place be the first stop to anybody looking for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Oh My Goodness!  I had one of the best meals of my life.  The Calamari was delicious!  The Scallops were divine!  I ordered the Pacific Swordfish (my first time having it) and it did not disappoint.  Add to that the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and you've got a perfect meal!!   So wonderful!  If you get a chance to eat here, take it!"}
{"text":"This is another great date place. I went here on a first date and we ended up coming back a few nights later!

I ordered the chopped salad which was super yummy. They have steak as well but I think their veggies are pretty good. I liked the atmosphere more so than the food at this place. There was a piano player and singer and it just reminded me of another time period. It's an older establishment too. I went there a few years ago as well and the crowd was mostly in the 40-50 age range so no annoying college kids was a welcome change. The crowd was still that same age group when I came back recently. 

The drinks are great too. This is the place to meet up, get a little dressy (always a plus and something I'm up for ) and listen to music.  The food is good I preferred the appetizers to the main course options though."}
{"text":"I was recently in Vegas for a week for work and unfortunately, the people I was with did not like fine dining.  I couldn't convince anyone to go to Cut nor Craftsteak, so we ended up at Mastro's.  This Mastro's is located in the City Center's shopping mall called Crystals.  Just look for the unique treehouse design.  We were lucky to get a table inside the treehouse.  

I enjoy eating course meals and family style, so here's how we ordered:

appetizers:
Escargot
Colossal shrimp cocktail
2nd course:
Seared Ahi tuna
2 Lobster bisques
Main course:
Bone-in ribeye
Garlic mashed potatoes
Creamed corn

We enjoyed most of our dishes except for the escargot and the seared ahi tuna.  Those two we wouldn't ever order again.  The lobster bisque and bone-in ribeye were the stars of the night.  There were 4 of us eating together and that was plenty of food.  We were so stuffed that we skipped the butter cake.  Service was friendly and our server staggered our meal perfectly.  Another excellent meal!"}
{"text":"Described in one word...EXCELLENT! 
My wife and I celebtated our anniversary. We wanted to go somewhere we had never tried before. After asking many people we decided on Mastros. We asked to be seated in the tree house. They went out of their way to do this for us (Saturday night in Vegas and March Madness)not an easy request. Started at the bar for cocktails, staff was great and they pour them STIFF.
The food was fabulous to say the least, but the staff was the true star. Very involved in our experience and wanting it to be a perfect night for us. They all took the time to engage with us and have a little fun. GREAT JOB MASTROS.
Locals dining on the strip usually feel like just another one of the herd, but not at Mastros. You were on point and for that you have earned two new loyal customers."}
{"text":"We had a perfect evening. Food was perfect and service was impeccable. Our server, Katie, was on top of our every need. We had the huge tomahawk streak that was cooked to perfection. We love to cook and are quite good at it. We enjoy having foods that we can't cook. Getting that perfect crust on the steak is nearly impossible at home, but Mastros has it mastered and is worth the price. Ok the Mac and cheese is not as good as mine, sorry. The Brussels sprouts were very good but again, not as good as mine. The evening was wonderful. We had such mediocre dinners in Vegas up to this point that is was such a breath of fresh air. We have eaten at Mastros several times, even near our home, and never had a bad meal. This was our 26th anniversary and they even gave us a complimentary cake. Thank you."}
{"text":"We arrived before 5 and sat at the bar. Very friendly, knowledgeable bartender.
Our drinks were perfect and the atmosphere was relaxing.

My husband and I decided to eat appetizers. I had the Best crab cake anywhere! Filled with so much crab and just the right combo of filling. One crab cake comes with avocado on the side and it was a meal for me. My husband was disappointed in the Vanilla Crusted Shrimp because it was a lot of crust. The prawn was good though. Give it a 3.

Their signature warm butter cake was the most decadent, delicious dessert! Fresh fruit on the side, ice cream on top and a side of rich, fluffy whipped cream. My husband & I thought that was something we would not eat, but we finished off everything! Definitely a dessert to share with 2 or more. Fantastic=5!"}
{"text":"Check your steak. They taste great but always takes 2 shots to get it right. Always overcooked or raw. Awesome when they finally get it right."}
{"text":"Just great....food and service was wonderful....yes...the most famous lobster mash potato was indeed...magnificent !!  it is must try.  The Filet Mignon I had was wonderful as they serve it on a plate that is 400 degree."}
{"text":"This my favorite steak house in Vegas, tonite I will be here for my birthday. Best place and my only place I'm vegas"}
{"text":"We made a reservation via OpenTable and though we showed up almost 25 minutes late, they seated us quickly and at a great table in The Treehouse.

The bread basket was fantastic (as is most). There is Epi Baguette, Sourdough, Pretzel, and Cheese Crisp Crostini. The baguette had that wonderful chewy, moist interior, crusty exterior, and a great distinctive flavor.

We started with Fried Calamari ($15) and it's served a little differently now. They drizzle the spicy garlic aïoli over the calamari and it's served with a sweet chili dipping sauce along with the usual fresh lemon. I thought it would be too much with the aïoli and the chili sauce, but they really complemented each other (though you do need acidity from the fresh lemon juice to cut through the creaminess and sweetness). I would prefer the calamari to not be pre-sauced, but it was still tasty.

The 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye ($59) was decent; it was cooked a tad over our request of medium rare and though it had nice strips of fat around the edges, the cut lacked a lot of marbling. It was still tender and mostly flavorful, so we enjoyed it.

I really liked the cut and size of their Chilean Sea Bass ($51) and it was good, but it didn't have that super buttery texture that I've come to associate with this fish. It was a little disappointing and I'm not sure what attributed to its non-characteristic texture; perhaps overcooked?

As it as been said many times, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes ($38) is absolutely divine! The super creamy potatoes are combined with large pieces of fresh Maine Lobster and finished with a pool of butter. It actually looks more like a buttery lobster broth, but I guess it's just lots and lots of butter! Either way, it's obviously delicious.

Not something we would normally order, I was pleased with the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ($34). The chewy, pillowy gnocchi is tossed in a asiago alfredo sauce and finished with black truffle and King Crab. All of these flavors worked together nicely and nothing was particularly overwhelming or too heavy.

Lastly, we ordered Sautéed Broccoli ($13). I was surprised how little it was sautéed, however, it was crunchy and a perfect accompaniment to the rich potato dishes and steak.

Since we were here for my birthday, they brought out a complimentary slice of their Triple Chocolate Layer Cake (I believe it's half). Not typically a chocolate cake fan, I loved it! The cake was really moist, wonderful mousse, and I loved the crunchy chocolate shavings and fresh raspberries. It's also served with a mountain of their wonderful fresh whipped cream (there was so much, we thought it was ice cream!).

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant to the very end, service was phenomenal! We were tended to by so many individuals and everyone was on top of their game. Everyone helped each other and we never had a moment of need.

The prices are mid- to high, but the portions are very generous! I assume most people leave with bags (we walked out with a large one as our food would've been enough for 3-4 people). Overall, we had a really wonderful experience and the food was good (above average)."}
{"text":"Love me some Mastro's and lucky for us Vegas has the best Mastro's ever; you can be casual or fancy...it's a great environment. 

*Request to be seated in the 'tree house'  when making your reservation. 

-Try a speciality dry ice cocktail, the presentation is so fun. 

-Lobster mashed potatos are a must try here. 

-All the desserts are amazing but the butter cake with their whip cream KILLS any other cake dessert you have ever had. Incredible & complimentary for special occasions. 

Superb service & food. From the starter bread to the brussel sprouts to the sea food tower to the steak you will not be let down!"}
{"text":"Good food but pricey. Great service by the staff."}
{"text":"Mastro's never disappoints.

But their Ocean Club locations, in my opinion is the better than their \"Steak House\" locations, because the ambiance is quieter and more enjoyable. 

This is our second time visiting this location, and both times we have left extremely happy and full.

The first visit we didn't make reservations, but they were able to accommodate since it was a Monday, this visit we made reservations, but it was on a Monday as well, so they weren't busy anyway.

The staff was very helpful and provided excellent service; never had to ask for our water to be refilled and were always attentive asking if we were doing okay. 

Food: We started the meal off with escargot and bone marrow. Both items were very delicious. Mastro's is honestly the only restaurant where their marrow is enjoyable because it is cooked to the point where there is zero blood, I don't know if that is the correct way to cook marrow, but that's my personal preference. My boyfriend loves their escargot. It is cooked, buttered, and seasoned perfectly. As for our entree we shared their Colorado rack of lamb as well as their sautéed spinach. Both items were cooked excellent as well. To end the night we ordered their famous warm butter cake. In all honesty, their butter cake is the main reason we love Mastro's. There isn't anything like it. The warm, sweet, soft cake paired with the vanilla ice cream just go so well together. 

Overall, we love Mastro's and anytime there is a location we are staying at, we make it a goal to check that location off the list. So far we have been to the Newport Beach and Beverly Hills location here in SoCal, and the location in Chicago. It is so good, how can you not!"}
{"text":"2 stars for decent food & very nice ambiance, I think.
Nice basket of bread to stuff in your pie hole while waiting around.
Lousy mac n cheese, they even bake it w/cheese on top to disguise how dry it is. Rib eye was sizzling hot, plate was 400degrees... Wife had good gnocchi plate(truffle...)"}
{"text":"I had an exceptional meal here this past weekend. As always, my eyes are always greedy and I order more than I could ever eat. I ordered the following: 1) clam chowder was delicious, however, it could have used more clams. 2) crab cakes were one of the better crab cakes I've had. Plenty of crab meat! 3) Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese was outstanding 4) lobster mash potatoes was good but nothing special except the few pieces of lobster added to it 5) snap peas are in season and always worth ordering 6) rack of lamb was cooked to perfection and I really enjoyed it 7) can't leave Mastro's without ordering some butter cake:) 8) Mr Michael provided us with exceptional table service:)"}
{"text":"My first visit to a Mastro's was this past weekend and they didn't disappoint.  My girlfriend and I had the bone-in ribeye (x2) and the lobster mashed potatoes.  The steak? Cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Nice buttery taste to it even though it doesn't come out in a plate of butter (like that other steakhouse.. heehee).  The lobster mashed potatoes?  Heaven on a dish.  It is definitely a must order the next time I go to a Mastro's."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. I took my gf here for her birthday, because she loves mall food, and this restaurant is in one of the most expensive malls I've ever been to. All jokes aside, the food is excellent and the service was impeccable. I had the lamb rack; it was mouth watering and the presentation was unique."}
{"text":"Awesome food,service and atmosphere! Request Eric for a guided excellent dining experience. I had the petite Filet omg the seasoning was crispy, cooked medium rare  just melts in your mouth. Start with the Ravenous Pineapple for a refreshing beverage and don't miss out on the Buttercake!!! Hubby liked the Seabass and enjoyed the Mambo salad. A DEFINiTE return in the future"}
{"text":"Saving the best for last, and it does get better (hence the 5 stars!)

After booking a reservation here on OpenTable, I arrived on the date of my reservation to be UNgreeted (I'm using it, English fanatics!) by the *two* associates in the front.  Both were busy with other, more important things I suppose.

But then, finally, attention was given.  They couldn't locate my reservation, and then finally found it to let me know it was the next night, not the night I arrived.  I was noticeably upset, as I had even received an email from OpenTable to confirm my reservation.  (I guess it was an OpenTable error somehow though... and have since had other OT issues).

Fortunately, they were accommodating in squeezing me and my boyfriend in on a busy Friday night. We got a great spot even - but then I suppose not many seats at this small restaurant wouldn't have a nice \"view\".   You're in a bird cage overlooking all of the shoppers!

Throughout the entire meal, attention was not lacking.  You're pretty much pampered here, and every.single.associate is ON IT.  

Are you about to take a picture of your group? Not without assistance from a waiter.  

Had more than a few sips of water?  It'll be refilled practically instantaneously.

So, the service once seated was impeccable. 

Drinks - very reasonable for vegas, and they do it right. No dilution here.

Food:

Complimentary Bread:  Well, I had already known just how good their pretzel bread was from former visits in the O.C., and while the Las Vegas pretzel bread was slightly harder, it was still delicious.

Mushrooms:  Infused with something magical.  Seriously, savored every single bite of these. Hands down, the greatest mushrooms that have ever met my taste buds.

Mac & Cheese:  Ridiculously cheesy.  Cheese with pasta, with more cheese, with a blanket of cheese melted on top of it.  And surprisingly good as a left over too.  

Steak:  Filet Mignon.... no sauce needed, no seasoning needed.  The cut of meat was flawless and perfectly tender.  

Dessert:  I did say I was saving the best for last, and this was it.  Butter cake, all the way. Moist cake accompanied with vanilla ice cream... sounds traditional but they've got a recipe that will leave every bite ending with Oohs and Aaahs.  The house-made whipped cream came in a massive pile, and then some."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place a lot, I think everything I had here was fantastic
All I can remember was the fantastic beer battered shrimp. 
But I know it's a good find
I haven't been there in about 3 years, I will return"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. Filet was excellent and our server Piotr was outstanding. Got to try the butter cake it was fantastic"}
{"text":"Mastro's to me is just another steak house. Just like Fleming's or Morton's and Ruth's Chris, Morton's offers a very classic steak restaurant. Visiting Vegas, I made a decision I shouldn't have made. Not to say that going to Matro's Ocean Club inside the Shops At Crystals was a mistake or a bad experience. I just have a dining out rule when I'm in Vegas. \"If there's one in LA or OC, don't go there.\" Well, I broke my rule, but it was all for a birthday celebration. I figured, I probably won't be going to Mastro's anytime soon, so might as well. And the bird's nest really attracted me. I was really happy with my decision for the most part.

We started things of with bread service. They offered pretzel, crouton, baguette, dinner roll, and wheat bread. The breadbasket had variety all were quite good. My favorite was the pretzel -- it was soft and airy.

I had some of the Caesar salad to start. I needed some kind of greens to soak up all that meat juice. Their Caesar salad was near perfect. The dressing was nice and creamy. The addition of parmesan cheese and cracked pepper made everything better.

I was ready for the main event, the 22oz bone in rib eye. The rib eye is one of my favorite cuts because of the even fat marbling and soft texture. Mine was cooked perfectly medium rare, though a bit more on the rare side. This actually caused the meat to be a bit tough. This cut did have some nice fat running through the steak. This helped with the tenderness and mouth feel of the meat. Even though this wasn't the best steak I have had, the help of the amazing sides made it all better.

The real reason I came here wasn't the steak. Well it is, and it isn't. The real reason I came here was for the lobster mashed potatoes. I mean. It is Mastro's Ocean Club -- Ocean, meaning seafood is in order. This side dish was rich as can be -- full of butter. I believe the potato to butter ratio is near 1 to 1. With a whole lobster tail carefully chopped up and placed in a pool of butter, the potatoes were creamy and flavorful. The pure essence of the sea was encased in butter, and mixed with potatoes. Eating this with steak was pure bliss. The kid in me wanted to order the mac and cheese. made with gorgonzola, the flavor was very rich. Another cream heavy and dairy heavy dish, the mac and cheese was delicious. My favorite was the layer of melted cheese on top.

My favorite was dessert. We were celebrating a birthday, so they gave us a chocolate birthday cake. The cake was rich in chocolate and eating just a few bites was enough for me. The best thing about this dessert was their home made whipped cream. Served on the side in a bowl, the homemade whipped cream was so dense and fluffy. The cold cream and the chocolate cake was a perfect mixture. Honestly though, the whipped cream was the best thing ever. I wanted to take it all home.

Eating at Mastro's Ocean Club was a great experience. The location is a bit awkward. As you are enjoying your expensive meal inside an amazingly architectured \"bird's nest,\" you look out and you see people shopping. That is cool and all, but you can't help but think you are inside of a mall -- Well, you are inside of a mall, and this Mastro's makes sure you know that. I couldn't help but think I was at a very glorified food court at a mall. When I eat at a nice establishment, I want to feel secluded from the world. I just didn't get the at from here. The food is great, though as far as steakhouses go in Las Vegas, you can do a lot better. I guess I can only break my rule once. Never eat at Las Vegas where you can at home."}
{"text":"Funny how the hours for this place say they are open until one. But we walk in 20 after midnight and get refused service. Won't come back. Rude fricking bartender. Ruined our friends birthday"}
{"text":"Known for their steakhouses, the Mastro Group's seafood house in upscale Kierland Commons offers an overwhelming choice of seafood dishes...in addition to their extensive menu they had about 10 specials on the night I ate there.  I opted for the surf and turf...a 12oz filet and \"huge\" alaskan king crab legs.  The filet was to die for (one of the best steaks I've ever eaten) and the crab legs were awesome.  They have an excellent wine list and a hoppin' bar scene.  The excellent food does come at a high price $$$$."}
{"text":"Came in with a large party of about fifteen. We sat near the server pos station, inn the far corner. Mind the fact one person in our party has mobility issues that require a scooter, which we were asked to keep at the front. Our server was great, knew the menu substantially well! Made plenty recommendations and alternatives. I ordered the one chicken entree on the menu at if Sunday October 15th. Food arrived seeming fast, Keep in mind we're a party of fifteen, give or take. I immediately thought it was odd to see food on trays. The restaurant is somewhat well lit for dinner but apparently not lit enough. I dove into the generous helpings of sides dishes. That accompanies my chicken enters. The chicken was pink and raw towards the middle. Unfortunate for a restaurant with such high standards. I wouldn't have been upset to see a needle hole from a thermometer to ensure my food is up to par. Worst part is I hadnt seen the pink in the center of the breast until at home. Truest upsetting, I though I was having health issues the next day until I opened my to box. Unacceptable in any setting."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my cousins in early August and I totally forgot to write a review. The best service in all of Vegas along with the best steak. Among the three of us we shared the New York strip, asparagus, Mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes. Also had the lemon drop martini. For dessert, the butter cake just melted in my mouth. Let's just say I was half asleep during Cirque De Solei's Zarkana show because food coma!"}
{"text":"Our server was very rude.  He rushed our large party.  When one lady said she needed more time, he told her to \"just pick one.\"  We were shocked.  Then he rudely refused to divide the checks, despite several requests before we ever ordered.  We have never received this type of service at any restaurant, & definitely did not expect it at Mastros."}
{"text":"Every dinner I have had at Mastro's Ocean Club has been delish!! I am heading there tonight and can't wait to have some of my faves.... Tuna tar tar, Chilean sea bass and the brussel sprouts!!! Mmmmmm. Can't beat having live entertainment as well. Managers and service is the best here. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Pricey but so good! Even the escargot was amazing, and their signature butter cake is the best!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Wife had bone-in ribeye, and was super tender full of flavor! The sides were excellent also. If you're a fan of bone-in ribeye you will love Mastro's - simple dinner, but extraordinary flavor. Had the chopped salad, bone-in ribeye, asparagus and fries. Entire meal and service was without blemish - definitely a 5 star evening."}
{"text":"While in Vegas for a friend's birthday, we decided to have a nice dinner and settled on steak. After reading about Mastro's, I made a reservation, and we were seated in the large wooden structure thing. Screw it, I'm just gonna go straight to the steak.

When our waiter mentioned that their special was an A5 grade 33oz. wagyu tomahawk, I was sold. It's basically a thick cut, bone-in ribeye, and I knew I was in for something special just by looking at it. The first thing that immediately caught my attention was the rim - it was HUMUNGADUNGA. Normally, the rim just encircles the outer edge of about half the eye, but this rim was almost the same size as the eye! Why is this such a big deal? Of all the steak cuts, the rim of the ribeye is the absolute BEST tasting piece in the entire beef carcass. I always separate it from the rest of the ribeye so I can save it for last. The muscle fibers in the rim are very loosely bound, and marbling of ribeyes is second to none. What this means is that you have a piece of meat that's super tender (just as tender as a filet), super juicy, and super flavorful, which perfectly describes the wagyu tomahawk. Each bite was a blast of rich and savory goodness. The juices coat your mouth in a sheen of happiness. There truly is nothing to criticize. The only thing I could wish for is that they serve just the rim as its own cut of steak.

The next time you're in Vegas, forget the crappy frozen king crab legs at the buffets, and treat yourself to something really worth the trip and big bucks."}
{"text":"Optically Impressive!  Valet service with all the nice wheels displayed curbside.  Walk in and you know you're going to have a quality night.

Just there for drinks? - the bar is designed for a complete visual effect with bottle art stacked on shelves to the ceiling with colored lighting...don't worry sports fans, your favorite playoff, pga, mlb will be tuned in so you can order round after round.

Seafood or Steak?  Every table I walked past had the signature chilled seafood tower (Lobstah, big honkin shrimp, crab legs, oysters)....it will not only impress, it tastes so fresh it's worth splurge for a special occasion.  Petite filet on a super hot white plate was fabulous and the lobster mash is a signature side.  

Service matches the drink and food quality.

Walk from the Westin Kierland Resorts is okay."}
{"text":"Overall, I really enjoyed my meal but be prepared for a different ambiance! The restaurant is literally in the middle of the mall, with the tables pretty much out in the open. Not a huge deal, but definitely not ideal. 

I had the mambo salad (spicy caesar salad with no croutons), 8 oz. Petite filet and cheese cake for dessert. The filet was perfectly prepared, served on a burning hot plate that sizzled and continued to cook the sides of creamed corn, spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. Our table also shared the steamed mussels appetizer, which was excellent! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner on Saturday evening with a friend that was visiting.  We started with the Caviar which was delightful, it was beautifully presented and tasted delicious.   The Caesar salad was good but not exceptional. The 3 of us shares a bone in filet.  It was tender and exceptionally tasty. We ordered the steak medium rare. The steak came out closer to rare but it was still delicious. A must have is the truffle crab gnocchi!!  The service was great too!"}
{"text":"Mastro's Beverly Hills is in my top 3 steakhouses so I decided to give Ocean Club a try. It did not disappoint. The food is great and since you want everything the real problem becomes trying to not order too much. Service is top notch and the staff is very friendly and knowledgable. Shrimp cocktail is served chilled with dry ice and the atomic horseradish that comes with it is sweet and will singe your sinuses in the best possible way. The lobster mashed potatoes are a must get, rich and filled with large pieces of lobster meat. We also got the Wagyu tomahawk cut to share which was perfectly marbled. 

So why not 5 stars?  These items may seem nit picky but you can be the judge. We ordered the Wagyu black and blue (seared rare) and while it did have the cool red center you really want a better crust on it. In addition I know we were sharing but they simply cut the steak down the middle with one person getting the bone piece. For something like this you would expect a presentation similar to a porterhouse. Lastly although it shouldn't matter that it located inside a mall it does mean that the people next to you could be in shorts, flip flops and a backwards baseball cap. I know it's Vegas but come on."}
{"text":"We splurged (again) to enjoy mastro's great food and service.  This last visit was our second visit and we weren't disappointed at all.  TIP: to guarantee your spot, always make a reservation.  Las Vegas ocean club has the beautiful tree house and I even asked to sit in there.  They brought us to the bar while we waited for our table.  

I was pleasantly surprised that the drinks we ordered were actually strong; usually other restaurants are stingy with their alcohol.  Maybe it was due to being in Las Vegas, but those drinks were tasty and strong.  A few minutes later we were seated inside the tree house.  The staff were very attentive to us.  We ordered ahi tuna and a filet to share. A couple of side orders of veggies, salad, crab cakes and some bread completed our meal.  I really thought that we would not have enough food but I couldn't finish it all!

We promised ourselves that we would come back just for dessert- and we did return the next day! - just for the chocolate pudding cake and their cheesecake.  I LOVE their pudding cake and I am not a chocolate person!  Again, their service was outstanding. Crazy busy on a Friday or Saturday night or slow like a Sunday dinner, the staff never forgot about you.

If you ever want to experience great service and food - consistently, mastro's ocean club in Las Vegas is a sure bet."}
{"text":"Mastro's where to begin. Located in the Crystals mall just outside the main entrance to Aria, sister restaurant to Scottsdale & Beverly hills' location. we embarked on night one in Vegas.  So let's start with the drinks at the Piano bar a very nice opening where a piano man and gorgeous singer belt out a few tunes prior to dinner where we were seated in the Tree house so to speak.  Bright open and airy we were treated service wise very nicely.  8 Tonight and waiters and staff were brisk and efficient.  The standard push for bottled water well you get the drill. A High end steak house and fish place that needs no preamble.

Great Start bread basket with Pretzel breads and such excellent! 

I'll run it down.  Shrimp cocktail is a highlight with the dry ice making the fog come off the shrimp it's an eye catcher.  Asked for horseradish on the side oh boy the hottest dam thing I've ever consumed. one drop in the sauce made my dry stuffed nose wince and my head was cleared like a nitrate ammonia pack from my football days. Yea baby it was good! A lobster cocktail was also equally outstanding.  Multiple salads were also ordered and shared from a Chopped house salad, a Cesar salad and beefsteak tomatoes & Mozzerella.  Skip the last one. 

Entrees: 7 Steaks one piece of fish.
Every single steak was absolutely delicious From the bone in filet to the strip to the bone in KC Strip there were outstanding. One was cooked or shall I say undercooked and the handled it not only by fixing the dish but removing it from the bill.  The Hawaiian big eyed Tuna was horrible only way to describe it. Sorry but another get this out of here moments. 

Sides: All very generous in size and easily splittable among the group 4 sides way too much for 8 people.
Lobster Mashed potatoes a die for moment outstanding
Sauteed mushrooms yummy
Gorgonzola Mac & cheese another to die for moment

Creamed spinach excellent.

All and all a fine dining experience with the drawback of a couple of 1 undercooked steak and one bad entree both removed from Bill make this a nice experience."}
{"text":"This place was poppin!  Right when we came in, the host and hostesses were ready to help out.  You could hear chatter from every corner since everyone was enjoying their dinner experience.  So it may be a little difficult to hear and converse with alongside the live band.  Being a little early we started with their house Cabernet at the bar.  The wall was covered with a variety of bottles of every ETOH imaginable seemed like.  

So what was devoured over dinner?
Bread basket with a creamy yummy butter
Appetizer:  Seared Ahi Tuna - a nice starter before the main course, they have a wide selection of appetizers to choose from.
Entree:  Seared Chilean Sea Bass - excellent!  The outside had a little bit of crisp and crunch while the inside was perfectly moist and tender and flavorful.  I would definitely eat this again!  This can also be ordered blackened or \"bread crumb\" style.
Side:  Sautéed asparagus - I only ate the top part, as the stem part of the asparagus was not as easy to chew.  Nonetheless, tasty! 
Dessert:  Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake - so delightful and buttery melt-in-your-mouth experience.  It was topped with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with a strawberry syrup or similar and garnished with fresh strawberries.  It also came with a separate bowl of vanilla whipped mascarpone cream.  This can be shared between 2 to 4 people easily.  Coffee (pretty large cup in size) was also enjoyed with this dessert. 

Service was on point:  clean, attentive, knowledgable, friendly
Music:  live band, live singers, in tune, up-to-date music, great performance and easy on the ears
Overall a classy experience!"}
{"text":"A good place to go when you're on expense account. Very good quality food. Excellent service. Classic old school style steak and seafood house. A lot like Morton's or Gibson's. No surprises here. 

The lobster mashed potatoes were impressive as was the crab meat gnocchi. 

Book your reservation before 6:30 as the place gets packed every night (mostly out-of-towners)"}

Sea bass perfectly cooked, extensive wine menu. Always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. Their basket of assorted breads are wonderful. The steam mussels were great and flavorful. The escargots didn't have enough flavor in them. The lobster & gnocchi was great and was one of my favorite dish. If you are planning to eat here please call for RSVP because you don't want to wait in a long line."}
{"text":"I would give 6 stars!!! Great food...pricey...but worth treating yourself once in a while!!! Bring your gold card :)"}
{"text":"Appetizers: Truffle Lobster Gnocchi, Ocean Club Crab Cakes, & Escargot are ALL very flavorful and DELICIOUS! Also had the Alaskan Crab Mashed Potatoes (don't remember the name) equally delicious!

Entree: I would recommend the Bone-In Ribeye. The portion is good. I would like recommend the Sea Bass. I tried two of their Sea Basses and were not impressed at all. 

Sides: Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese and Steamed Asparagus. Asparagus was just steamed. Mac & Cheese was the best I've ever tasted besides the one from Capital Grille.

Dessert: We had chocolate cake. Nothing special"}
{"text":"Came here for our wedding anniversary. The drinks selection (especially the vast wine selection) was impressive. I had the sangria and it was great; they are generous with the alcohol. My husbands drink was strong,  but nobody is complaining here. The complimentary bread is amazing! The pretzel bread is to die for. I had the salmon and my husband had the swordfish; cooked perfectly.  Sides: lobster mashed potatoes and truffle wild mushrooms. Wow!! The mashed potatoes had these enormous chunks of lobster, exquisite! We come here every year for our anniversary and this time didn't opt for dessert, but if you do the butter cake is amazing! My only thing is that they should keep the military discount consistent, depending on the server our total percentage discount  will always vary."}
{"text":"Most amazing place we've eaten, all around. Good thing to note, they offer a generous military/LE discount. Absolutely loved everything about our visit. I had the 12oz filet, wedge salad, garlic mashed potatoes, clam chowder, chocolate covered strawberries, and a glass of Hess Cabernet. Everything is a la carte, with large portions. I would say the cost is equivalent to most steakhouse prices, but Mastro's has great sized portions and amazing quality. We highly recommend the Las Vegas location and will be visiting the New Port Beach location for our next date night. Hoping to have another wonderful dinner in NPB very soon!"}
{"text":"The food and service was on point here at Mastro's. 

I always heard great things about it and I am so glad I finally tried it. 

To start, I had the steamed mussels. Although the mussels were small the sauce and cheeses croutons were incredible. I took advantage of all the various breads they had in the basket just to dip in the sauce and
Indulge more. 

For dinner I had the Hawaiian tuna served sashimi style. It was seared with Asian inspired flavors and didn't make you feel so heavy. I will say that it is a quite a portion and initially seeing it can be overwhelming. 
They warn about the size of the side portions so please think it through or else you will have way too much. I had a table of 4 and we battled to eat everything cause it was yummy but man I came out of there a fatty wack. I LOVED the Cream corn and Alaskan Crab truffle gnocchi. Done deal with those two! I had the lobster mash and yes it had big chunks of lobsters and it was good but not as great as it's hype was. We also had sautéed broccoli and honestly it looked steamed. They serve you the sides which I thought was a great service. 

They gave us their signature butter cake. Topped with ice cream and fresh fruit with a side of whipped cream. If you even last this long to have dessert then order it. Warning-the portion is again good for 3-4 person so think it through before you order. 

I would highly recommended this place. It's ambiance is okay because it still does feel like you are still in the shopping area even though you can't see it too much. Great service and great food. You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal that I didn't like here.   They have a prime rib that literally makes the table tilt (it's so big).  The pretzel bread is so amazing that you have to be careful not to spoil your appetite."}
{"text":"Better food than most upscale restaurants, good service weird location and set up. I prefer to go to the Mastro's in L.A."}
{"text":"Food was ok and entertainment was awful. There was a male-female duo that slighted the experience, for sure. I'm not encouraged to give it another try because the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've frequented the two locations in LA and was interested in how the experience would be in Phoenix. Did not disappoint. Loved the food. Loved the wine. Loved the live music that softly flowed from the bar area into the dining area. Loved loved loved the butter cake. Loved the service. You guys rock!

Did not like the whole valet thing. They even had the handicap spots roped off and had a Bentley and a Maserati parked in the handicapped spaces. Not saying people with handicap stickers don't drive those type of cars but I suspect those were cars valet parked and had nothing to do with handicap stickers. If they did legitimately have handicap parking rights, my bad. But if not, shame on you guys."}
{"text":"Mastro's is always fantasitc, highly recommend their seafood salad that they have under appetizers, it's beyond excellent. The dining experience never ceases to amaze..."}
{"text":"Awesome night at the Ocean Club!  Great service, food and atmosphere.  Windows open to Kierland and perfect weather. Best steak (filet) I've had this year.  We had the seafood tower that was  amazing and the lobster bisque soup was full of lobster chunks.  Great night to celebrate a special night with friends."}
{"text":"The waitstaff over sells food that apparently is microwaved, and implying sides are included when waitstaff encourages most expensive sides. Again all microwaved food. Our bill was 295 for 2 people each having 2 glasses of wine."}
{"text":"Once again, Maestro's doesn't disappoint (same fantastic experience as the one in Vegas).  However, once again, I leave with the stomach gurglies because of how rich the cream is in their dishes.  I had to have the truffle gnocchi again because it's SO good.  

But, damn, it's worth it!  It has to be said that, even though I ordered the petite filet medium rare, and I ended up with one that was medium/medium well, it was still seasoned very well.   I think I just ended up with someone else's order (there were fourteen of us).

The bathroom attendant in the women's restroom is a hoot!  She's worth a visit in, and of, herself."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas Party for the company there Saturday in the private Room 3. The swordfish I ordered was good but the cheesecake was out of this world! Can you tell I have a sweet tooth?!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience ! Food,service, ambiance all superb. A perfect steak! Oysters Rockefeller to die for! Waiter was amazing, entire staff superlative!"}
{"text":"Being a Vegas local, living on the strip, I get to try amazing Vegas eats weekly. I must say by far Mastros is a step above the rest & my personal favorite restaurant on the strips.

Service is top notch, as good as it gets! Some of my fav dishes are the Scallops, KC Strip, Hamachi, Petite Filet Mignon, & of course the amazing Buttercake dessert. Must try."}
{"text":"My mom, sister and I are in Scottsdale on vacation.  When we planned this trip the first restaurant everyone got excited about was the Mastro's Ocean Club.  We made reservations weeks in advance. Ten days before our trip I suggested canceling the reservation. Here's why.  My mom found out her cancer was back the first week in March.  Since then she's had 3 outpatient surgeries, 7 attending specialists and 33 radiation treatments. She has suffered the common radiation treatments the same as most in her position.  No energy and a stomach that gets upset when she looks at rich foods.  I didn't want her to feel like we had to go to Mastro's if her stomach would not tolerate the richness of the food. She told my sister she was disappointed we weren't going to Mastro's and that she REALLY wanted to go and wanted to enjoy a fabulous meal.  We kept the reservation. Our waiter got our drink orders and asked if we had been to Mastro's before. We advised we were frequent visitors at the vegas location. We fine dine frequently on vacation and we normally vacation 8-10 to times a year.  Mastro's in Vegas has always been an excellent experience regardless of what we order and how much we spend. We tip very generously. After our order of lobster bisque for each of us, 2 crab cakes, sautéed shrimp, mashed potatoes, a twice baked potato and a 16 ounce NY strip we received our delicious lobster bisque promptly.  Entrees were brought next and my mom cut into her steak and took a bite and the char was so overwhelming (it was thick black on top) she immediately expressed her disappointment.  It was NEVER served this way in Vegas.  The waiter came by right after we were served to ask if everything was good.  My mom explained her disappointment with the overwhelming char on the steak.  He offered an apology and took the steak back to the kitchen.  The manager, Rob, came by to let us know they would replace it with a new one, but it would take several minutes.  No problem.  She wanted to eat her twice baked potato and steak together so she stopped eating.  The steak was brought out and the manager accompanied.  They asked her to cut into it and a one inch + segment through the middle of the steak was completely raw.  It was ordered medium plus which was communicated with the waiter as a line of pink through the center.  It was sent back again. Only to return in two pieces and still raw in the middle.  She told him she still wouldn't be able to eat it.  The manager proceeded to explain she wanted medium well and it was implied that she hadn't ordered it properly.  No apology from him.  The same steak brought out is now being returned in 3 pieces to the kitchen to be brought out a fourth time.  It was brought to the table the fourth time, no manager in tow this time, and it was cooked through.  No pink. And now tough from the same piece of meat being cooked 3 times.  She was done. My sister and I ate half our meals and stopped after round two of the steak being sent back because the experience was completely diminished.  We normally LOVE the butter cake.  We were ready to go.  The check came and the steak was charged to the bill. The steak that was charred thick black and then finally served completely cooked through in 4 tough pieces???? I realized that the manager never apologized for the cooking issue and that our waiter had disappeared from service from the time she brought the char to his attention to the time the dessert menus arrived. I was so furious I immediately went to Rob ( the manager) and told him after the steak being sent to her 4 times and then it was so tough she didn't even want it she was not paying for it.  He said okay and removed it from the bill.  No apology. This experience was awful.  I write reviews for all of my travels.  Food service is not perfect.  We don't expect that. But steak being run from the kitchen to the table four times, where the sides are all cold, we can't eat together and no one offering a sincere apology is unacceptable.  My mom deserved so much better than this and I TRULY believe this was the manager and not how Mastro's operates.  You can find my reviews of the Vegas location on TripAdvisor from 12/6/2016 and 11/24/2015."}
{"text":"Excellent! From entering this unique architectural design restaurant all the way through dessert. Hard to find fault with anything. The only issue was that we ate too much bread.  We started with the crab cake, then tried the ahi tuna tostada. We had the Seabass and the John Dory fish with a large sized side of the Lobster Gnocchi. The service was impeccable. This has to be one of the best seafood places anywhere."}
{"text":"I loved this restaurant as soon as we arrived. The atmosphere was classy and I loved how cozy and romantic the treehouse dining area was. Started with an $18 pomegranate martini which was well worth it. I loved the variety bread basket on the table.  The food was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the mussels as an appetizer and were both really impressed with the flavor and freshness. I also loved all the little garlic crustinis that we're everywhere in the sauce. For dinner I ordered twin lobster tails which my server nicely de-shelled for me table side. My boyfriend ordered a steak special - wagyu beef which he loved. Overall the service was outstanding and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"The sear on the NY strip was the best of any Mastro's steak we have had. Lobster Mac and cheese took it to an entirely new level."}
{"text":"Mastro's, you never cease to wow me!  I first fell in love with you in Newport Beach at both the Ocean Club and Costa Mesa locations. I think this is the best steak I've ever had.  Everything is cooked to perfection. We had the spicy mambo salad which was a twist on a traditional caesar with wasabi and sriracha dressing (order with croutons added back on).  We also had the shrimp cocktail which was coincidentally one of the best shrimp cocktails I've ever had too.  The dry ice makes it that much more fun.  I think Mastro's has one of the best bread baskets in town as well, particularly the pretzel bread.  It makes it so you almost don't even need sides -- however, if you are getting sides, you must try the lobster mashed potatoes at least once in your life!  Thanks Mastro's for a fantastic evening!"}
{"text":"I went to OC last night and the food was great but had a bad experience with Shawn our waiter.  We ordered a bottle of Stags Leap, an expensive cab.  I told him it might be too much wine for us but ordered it anyways. I had him put it in a decanter. There was about 8 ounces left in the decanter and he just left with it. When I asked him about it, he said it was all finished. I knew it wasn't so I complained to the manager, who was gracious. I didnt really care about the wine. But I chose Ocean Club to eat, it was a $300 bill, I treated Shawn very well, I tipped him well. I did not deserve to be taken advantage of by a waiter who is drinking the good stuff in the back room on my dime.  Beware of servers at this restaurant.  He didnt think I would notice. I did."}
{"text":"Its now a sad day.  This was once the best spot in Scottsdale. The food was amazing, the service, even better.  They had the same people working here for years--buss boys even. This tells you that they took care of their employees and it showed.

Then, Landrys bought them. This was a bad move.  They promised that Landrys wouldn't mess with them-- and they didn't for about a year, but then, we saw the corporate greed come down and destroy this once amazing restaurant.  First, they raised the prices- already an expensive (but worth it) place, everything got a $2-$4 bump.  Then, they lowered the food quality, you can tell. The steaks are no longer the perfect, tender, flavorful cuts they once were, the fish is no longer fresh and cooked perfectly every time. The sides, like greenbeans are served over cooked and wilted--almost as if they are using frozen veggies now.  Then there was the mass exodus of staff. The Bar Manager who knew everyones names, gone. The best servers, ones that have been their for years, gone.  We gave it another shot last night, our fears were confirmed.  Again the food was just no where near what it used to be.  Constant order mistakes-- basically you can see they aren't putting the pride in each dish like they once were.  The bar, which gave very liberal pours, now (again under corporate rule) is measuring the pours so not to give too much-- even for a $18 martini.

Its a sad day- however, Preston's is new in town, and their owner is the original chef that started Mastros... Also, the Mastros folks opened Steak 44 so check that out as an alternative.

Ive been a regular for 10 years at OC-- its a super bummer to see it fall so far."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food! I had the Sea Bass which was great! Great restaurant for special occasion or they have a bar area with live music if you choose to not make reservations for the weekend!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came by for dinner the other night and the experience left a lot to be desired. Made a group reservation and surprisingly, we were given a slew of small tables...

The restaurant has a unique venue but it was both loud and hot...in the middle of December...when it's 45F outside...

Started off with the bread and it was mediocre. Too hard and salty.

Moved on to the mixed greens salad and the vegetables weren't too fresh and the salad and plate both had some fridge taste...

Moved on to the Lobster Roll and again, it was pre-made, wasn't fresh, and had too much rice.

The seared ahi tuna came out really dark...didn't seem fresh.

My 8 oz Petite Filet was requested medium rare and came out as such. The meat had a strong flavor and was slightly salty...nothing spectacular here.

The sauteed mushrooms, creamed corn, and garlic mashed potatoes were all mediocre.

Service was okay. The wait staff slammed the dishes on the table and quickly split our side dishes...it was pretty rushed.

...the tap water had a strong chlorine smell...gross."}
{"text":"We love coming to Mastros.  The food is top notch as well as the service.  You must save room for their warm butter cake.  You will not be disappointed.  We had the sushi, crab legs, shrimp, steak, roasted chicken, creamed corn, scallops, and desserts.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club is fantastic!  The seafood is super fresh and caught and cooked within a day or two.  It is on the pricey side, but you are getting excellent food and impeccable service.  The experience was pleasant right from the sit down.  They even called my wife the following day to thank us for dining there.  How many restaurants do that these days?!?!"}
{"text":"The food we had was quite good.  But the rest was problematic.  They didn't have any Mahi Mahi which is what I went there for.  Weird.  I had scallops instead.  They were good.  But what really angered me was that the bill came with the wine charged at $75 instead of the menu price of $45.  Luckily I caught it.  They made some excuse about computers but I wasn't convinced.  It is sad to pay over $100 per person and also having to watch one's back.  Who needs the stress?  There were apologies, but noticeably no offer of something to make up for their \"mistake\".   Lots of other good restaurants in Scottsdale....."}
{"text":"Ahhh the seafood tower appetizer is more then a meal in itself.  So delicious and so much fun with friends.  Great to enjoy good food here."}
{"text":"One of the BEST meals our group agrees we've had. Even the simplest details, from the almost-double-portion martinis to the piping hot pretzel rolls are well-considered and designed to impress and welcome. Steak was incredible, portions were generous. We couldn't decide if the \"blackened\" finish or the truffle butter won more accolades, but I doubt you can go wrong. 

I had the petit (6oz) filet mignon with a crab cake to create my own little \"surf & turf\". Again, portions were above and beyond so it was almost more than I could finish. Having lived in Boston and Maryland I'm extremely well-versed in seafood, especially lobster and crab cakes, so I tend not to order these items freely elsewhere. The crab cake was pan-fried but still great. (I tend to prefer broiled.) The steak was better than top steak houses in DC/NY. Honestly. Find a way to get steak and seafood into your meal!

For \"family style\" sides we ordered creamed spinach (unnecessary), crab gnocchi (food heaven), lobster mashed potatoes (must get), and sweet potato fries (I didn't even bother as I had too much more interesting food already). The server actually walks around to distribute the sides as you like, which again was a wonderful touch for our group of 9. 

Other winners: shrimp sushi roll, all martinis, espresso drinks, tomato/burrata salad. 

Our server was really fantastic. Friendly, efficient, doting, and plenty loud which again, is very important when you have lists of specials to communicate enthusiastically and a long table of 9 semi-rowdy friends.

We used to actually go off the Strip to find hidden top steakhouse gems but now Maestro's in Crystal Center will be the go-to. 

If you have only ONE good/fancy/formal meal for your trip: go here."}
{"text":"Delicious! We started with a couple dozen oysters and the presentation alone gets 5 stars. Wonderful staff. Great food and even better desserts! Have been there a couple times already. Kids love it!"}
{"text":"Quite an exquisite appearance; I'm impressed! 

I came here on a short weekend trip with my hubby and was told that their steak is delicious from hearsay. So of course being the steak lovers that we are, we had to try this place out! We ordered two crab cakes, a steak entree for myself, fish fillet for the hubby & lobster mashed potatoes for our side entree to share. The crab cake appetizer was packed with ample crab meat; though I did feel that it lacked a bit in flavor. There was a side of greens topped with avocado which I didn't think complimented the crab cakes very well. The 22oz steak was DELICIOUS and yep, you bet I finished all 22oz of it! NOT! This hunk of meat was humongous and of course I shared it with my hubby! It was cooked to perfection at medium rare; nice and tender! Served sizzling hot on a scorching plate; I devoured every bite of my steak! My hubby's halibut was very good; soft and tender with a nice creamy sauce mixture. The lobster mashed potatoes was good. It was also super creamy with a hint of garlic. They weren't too generous with the lobster meat but  I wasn't expecting much beforehand.

Service here was definitely not up to par. Considering I had made reservations at 8:30pm TWO WEEKS prior to our arrival, I was hoping that we'd at least have to wait for ehh, maybe a good 10 minutes. NOPE. We were running a bit late that night and I called the restaurant at 8:15 to inform them that we were on our way and the lady confirmed that our table will be waiting. We get there around 5 minutes pass our reservation time (not as late as we thought after all!) and the lady tells us that it's actually going to be another 50 minute wait!? WHAT?! Though she did apologize that they were behind schedule, apart of me was just a wee bit frustrated. She should have at least have the decency to let us know ahead of time when I phoned in so we didn't have to rush over! Well nonetheless, we went to the sushi restaurant next door and surpassed time at the bar. 

The treehouse architecture of this restaurant is out of the ordinary and quite astounding! Built inside the Crystal mall - it has a unique structure to it. Entrance is accessible through the second floor; the restaurant is built from the 1st ground floor up.  

All in all, my hubby and I had a very scrumptious and fulfilling dinner together! I would highly recommend for all steak-lovers to be sure to check this place out if they're ever in Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"Ocean Club is excellent! Ordered the scallop dish and it was fabulous! Great atmosphere and ambience! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dessert--ambience was great. Bartenders friendly and attentive. Butter cake was recommended as their signature dessert so we ordered it. --omg so rich! Warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream and a large helping of fresh whipped cream. The ice cream wasn't very good...expected better but the warm butter cake with the fresh whipped.cream was so good. Definitely a must share order. Even the two of us couldn't fully finish it."}
{"text":"My wife planned a birthday surprise dinner for me last night. We have dined at the Beverly Hills Mastro's and were always happy with the food and service. Well we were more than happy with her choice. Our waiter Troy was great. He made us feel welcome and assured us that there was no rush. He decanted a special bottle of wine that we brought with us from the Aventura Winery in Paso Robles. This is a \"big\" red wine so we both chose the filet mignon with baked potato and sautéed brussel sprouts. The filet was best I have had in many years anywhere-hands down. Cooked to perfection and melted in mouth.

At the end of the meal Troy brought out their signature dessert, a warm vanilla pound cake served with real whipped cream topped with a candle. This is not your grandma's pound cake. It was just decadent and there was more than enough to share. I rarely give 5 Star reviews to any restaurant but this was a 5 Star experience in every sense. If you are in Vegas don't hesitate to book a table here you won't be disappointed. 

PS the ambience was enhanced by a excellent piano player who had just the right mix of songs to accompany a leisurely dinner."}
{"text":"I had made reservations to celebrate my mother-in-laws birthday. We wanted it to be special and seeing 4.5 stars in Yelp, I figured I was sure to impress. 

They did accommodate my request to sit in the tree house section of the restaurant, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, that's about all that went right for the evening. Our server was very aloof and completely inattentive. It felt as though we were bothering her by our existance.

We brought our drinks from the bar and were met by our server fairly promptly. After the perfunctory \"welcome to Mastros\" which seemed a strain for her to do, we didn't see our server for at least 20 Min's before she came back to check on us & take our order. She was very indifferent to our even being there, so much so, that I made the comment to my wife, that she was probably having a bad day. 

Here's where the fun begins. After receiving our salads which were very good, the fire alarm in the entire mall and restaurant started going off. So here we are with bright lights flashing all around us and the blaring wooooop......wooooop of the alarm is drowning out the piano player while everyone of the staff is walking around as if nothing is going on. We are all looking at ourselves and asking each other, is this for real? should we be evacuating? What if there is a fire? Finally after a FULL 10 minutes of this, I ask another server passing by what was going on. She politely said \"ohhh it's probably just a door someone opened\" and went on her merry way\". 

When our dinner arrived, our server never said a word about the incessant fire alarm blaring for the last 30 Min's. Not an \"I'm sorry about this\" or \"don't worry there is no emergency\", or we are working on shutting it off. No....Nothing at all. She just dropped off our food not to be seen again until I asked for the check. It was very bizarre 

Now about the food. We all had some type of fish. Which was mostly good. I thought my dusted halibut was very bland. I only ate half of my serving even though I was rather Hungary. The Gorgonzola mac & cheese was very good. The asparagus was decent. 

All told we finished up and even canceled the birthday desert  I reserved, because we couldn't stand the fire alarm any longer. The only thing our server said was, \" ohh your leaving,? yeah I guess the fire alarm is a bit annoying. Which is kind of like saying, \" yeah Vegas a bit warm in the summer\". 

All told, the food was 3.5 stars and the service was 1 star. At least I impressed my mother-in-law with the Jersey Boys show right before dinner. Now that was 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"We went last night as a party of seven for a farewell dinner before I head to the middle east.  We requested the tree house and a round table and it was perfect.  The service all night was outstanding, water glasses never got less than half empty.  We all ordered apps, salad/soups, main course and dessert.  The escargot was great, very garlicky and the sauteed shrimp were excellent.  The Caesar salad was good, but you could really taste the anchovy, if you don't like anchovies, stay away.
  I had a bone in filet and it was the best, most melt in your mouth steak I have ever had.  All the steaks, sea bass, scallops and lobster were great.  The only critique I have is that my father's rack of lamb was quite under done.  We should have sent it back, but he refused.  Overall, a great place for fine dining, bring your $$$$."}
{"text":"Tomahawk ribeye was amazing and cooked perfectly. Seafood tower was great and the sweet potato fries were unbelievable. Drinks were pretty good and the service was average."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a nice dinner, A classy place to bring friends for cocktails and food"}
{"text":"$$$$$$ but at least fairly quiet if you can some by 6-7pm - family style side dishes- water glass never 1/2 empty- special night - a good choice"}
{"text":"The table service is always excellent here; however, I ordered the scallops again and asked them to brown them well on the outside as in pan-sear them.  When they came to the table however there was no brown, they appeared baked. I sent them back yet upon return they were no \"browner\" just more baked and now rubbery in texture with the bread sticks on the plate that were once crisp now moist and bent ( it seemed that they just stuck the whole plate back in the oven).  Not what I expected from a restaurant of this caliber.  I left it at that - disappointed - even though I had specified from the start how I wished them prepared.  I won't be ordering the scallops here again."}
{"text":"Having been to another branch of Mastro's in Beverly Hills, my boyfriend sought to surprise me by making a reservation in this location for my 21st birthday because he was confident that it wouldn't disappoint and he was completely right. Just like the one in Beverly Hills, this place had outstanding service! Honestly, it has better service than the one in Beverly Hills. Our server, Tanya, was amazing. She kinda resembles Chelsea Lately but way prettier.. anyways she was very accommodating even though she was busy with other tables. I was impressed by her. Since it was my birthday, we got a complimentary dessert of my choice and I chose the warm butter cake. It is so delicious. We got escargot for an appetizer following our main course which was a rack of lamb with a side of creamed spinach along with a sushi tower which consisted of hamachi sashimi and clear lobster roll. Every single thing we ordered was simply delightful and at times, I wish I can go to Vegas just to eat at this specific location of Mastro's. Because it's Vegas, it is a little more crowded but the ambiance still reflects an elegant and classy environment. Thank you Mastro's Ocean Club for making my birthday memorable :)"}
{"text":"By far the best fine dining seafood dinner in the country.  Get the seafood tower as an appetizer or to share as a meal between 2-3 people.  The seabass oregento style is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Manager Dan was kind enough to ensure my second experience here was memorable. Everything was great. From the service (Our server was Tim) , to the food, there is not one thing I can say that was not excellent. We ordered the scallops again, which were as good, if not better than the first time. The clam chowder and chop salad were tasty. The biggest difference was how the steaks were prepared. My bone in ribeye was perfect. Each bite was tender and juicy, make sure to order the Mac n cheese side dish.

I would definitely recommend this place. Thanks, Dan!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Ocean Club last night to celebrate our 16th wedding anniversary.  We have spent many nights celebrating special occasions at OC and  have always had a good experience until last night. It was busy as usual, but we were able to find a seat at the bar.  The bar tenders were not just inattentive, they were downright rude.  One in particular was rolling her eyes at customers when they ordered.  This is the kind of service one would expect at a college dive bar at 1 a.m., not the Ocean Club at 8 pm. We let the manager know of our poor experience, and he didn't seem to care either."}
{"text":"Huge portions and great service. You can also bring your own wine.  Pricey but worth it! I had two additional meals due to the leftovers and cake;)"}
{"text":"Mastro's exceeds all expectations in all categories.  It is truly a first class establishment serving the best of steak, seafood, and beverages.  Their wine list is amongst the best I've seen and will satisfy the most discriminating of tastes.  You're guaranteed a wonderful experience through and through when you dine at Mastro's Ocean Club."}
{"text":"The service was amazing but the quality of food was not what I thought it would be. The price range was not worth the quality of food. However, the drinks were on point. 

I ordered a medium cooked prime rib and it came out crusty and overcooked. The manager offered to make me another steak, but I didn't want to wait the 20 minutes for another while my friend ate her salmon (tasty!). 

There's just too much hype for this location. The steakhouse at Circus Circus was much better than this restaurant. I hope I get what I pay for next time."}
{"text":"Do you like absolutely fresh fish flown into the goshforsaken desert on a daily basis? Me too! Had a great, expensive, wonderful meal here. Quality was exceptional. Service was top notch. Go on ... treat yourself."}
{"text":"Went there on New Years Eve, had a nice table and food always good. The service was atrocious.. so bad it didn't even deserve a tip- I did leave one, but wouldn't go back to this one again. One in Newport Beach much better. Of all the restaurants in Vegas, we chose your restaurant, we are locals and had a choice to go ANYWHERE!! Extremely DISAPPOINTED... many may ask , was it busy? No... just bad service."}
{"text":"Food is good, but ambiance is terrible. Literally eating dinner in the middle of a mall, which would be fine if I were at home but for Vegas it's lame. Service was excellent. But definitely think there are better places to go!"}
{"text":"This is a positive review, however some history is required.  Earlier this month we ventured to Ocean Club and had a less than desirable experience.  In return, I wrote a less than desirable review on Yelp to match.  The manager called me the next day to express his concerns over our experience and asked if we would be willing to return to give them an opportunity to make up for our experience.  

Last night we returned to Ocean Club.  I must say first, we went in with a bit of trepidation.  This, unfounded, apprehension had us concerned it was going to be an over the top experience.  We wanted to return to experience a good meal and drinks in a good atmosphere.  Of which we felt we missed on the prior visit.  These are obviously the foundation of a good experience and is the basis of our many historical visits to Ocean Club and Mastros.  Again, this concern of an over the top experience, thankfully, ended out being unrealized.  In turn, I hope this review does not appear to be over the top and is taken in the positive manner it is presented.

Friday nights are very busy at Ocean Club, most tables are full throughout the evening.  Upon arrival to our 7pm reservation the table was immediately available for our seating.  It was indeed a window seat.  The window seats are prime real estate, particularly this time of the year.  The windows are very large and open to the outside providing you a comfortable setting for a relaxed conversation in their very comfortable seats.  I am pretty sure we got the best window seat in the house, so if you have to call this the only over the top item, we found it perfectly acceptable!

The server presented us with the specials and their variety of preparations.  He obviously prepares himself and was very confident in his knowledge of these specials.  He was prepared to answer all questions we had about the different servings not usually on the menu. 

Many restaurants, both expensive and not, try to put you on a schedule, they want to get you in and out.  We really enjoy making an evening of this type of establishment.  We spent 3 hours there and did not once feel as though we were being pressured to move on with our orders for drinks, appetizer, dinner and dessert.  The server was there when we needed him and gone when we did not.  He was extremely patient.  No matter how the food is presented or tastes, to us, this makes all the difference in what can be a good experience or great experience.  For clarity his patience helped to make it a great experience.

We started with the shrimp cocktail and oysters from British Columbia.  The shrimp is very large, cleaned and trimmed perfectly so you can eat the whole thing.  The oysters, recommended by the server, were unlike any we had before, very creamy and had an awesome flavor.

The food was presented exactly as we would have expected to our party of 3.  
First in our party had Alaskan King crab legs.  These were presented completely split in half and cooked perfectly.  You have absolutely no work to do, with the exception of enjoying.  Tasted excellent

Second ordered lobster tail.  This was cooked as expected and enjoyed.

Third was my meal.  I ordered the bone in ribeye, medium rare.  I am very particular about my ribeye.  I rarely order it anywhere but Ocean Club / Mastros.  Both because of the flavor and their ability to cook perfectly to my med rare specifications.  Additionally, it comes on an extremely hot plate, sizzling and popping with temptation (the lack of this presentation was one of my chief complaints about our last visit).  It was presented exactly as I would have expected, sizzling and all.  It was cooked perfectly.  I could not have asked for a better flavor and presentation of my steak.

Overall, the experience was exactly how we have been accustomed to over the years at Ocean Club.  The service, food and atmosphere were the foundation of our excellent evening.  I would like to thank Scott and the server (cannot recall his name) for making our evening everything we wanted it to be.  We plan to return over and over again."}
{"text":"Daniel was my server, AH-MAZE-ING!! Service team was incredible, each dish was delicious and cooked perfectly. 
I enjoyed the sea bass, tender, rich in flavor with the scalloped potatoes. A glass of Haan Point Noir and the Butter Cake with fresh whipped cream, as recommended by Daniel. I dined alone as I'm on a business trip, they were kind enough to take care of my wine and dessert, truly a nice gesture!"}
{"text":"A very nice place with a great atmosphere.  The staff was on spot and the food was delish."}
{"text":"I think enough time has passed since my visit that the staff has turned over and no one would even remember me, except for maybe the lady who I rudely and crudely badgered into tipping the awesome pianist.  What can I say, by that point I was drunk on his playing, it couldn't have been the one martini I had!  Well, we had the crab cakes at the piano and what I can remember, they were wonderful.  Unfortunately, I can't remember much except stumbling out on my husband's arm, falling into the car and passing out.  They make a hell of a martini!  But I still remember the music, and damn that man could play.   If anyone knows where he plays currently, email me!  3 stars, since I really only drank and ate crab cakes at the piano.  But 5 stars for the music."}
{"text":"We walked over to Mastro's Ocean Club from the Westin Kierland.  The atmosphere is nice -- pretty formal, singer in the bar, great service too.  However, for the price point, I thought the food was just average.  Nothing amazing, nothing terrible, but certainly not worth $30-40/entrée.  For a similar experience, I would definitely recommend Eddie V's, just a couple blocks away, instead.

Note to families staying at the Westin, while there were many kids at Mastro's, they do not offer a kids menu."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a high end restaurant experience, this is a good place. The food is great and the service is very attentive. Don't forget to get their dessert."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. The food and service are awesome. The lemon drop martinis are great. Lump crabmeat cocktail is delicious. Steaks tender and tasty. Try to sit out in the treehouse for a unique experience. Top notch dining experience."}
{"text":"Warm butter cake was the best thing I ate!  Food was good, not great."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here to celebrate our engagement. His parents had gotten us a very generous gift card to use for exactly that purpose since they live far away and couldn't be here to celebrate with us.  Based on all the great reviews, we decided to spend it here.

I wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best steakhouse we've ever been to, but it was pretty damn good. We ordered Blue Point oysters, which were fresh and delicious. The sauteed scallops were absolutely to die for. It comes with bread to dip in the buttery sauce and it was so amazing.  Then we ordered a filet, the sea bass, lobster mashed potatoes and Gorgonzola mac n cheese. While still very tasty, each item had some issues.  The lobster in the mashed potatoes were a bit overcooked and slightly chewy.  The mac n cheese had no hint of Gorgonzola at all and as soon as it slightly cooled while sitting at our table, the thick top layer of cheese became hard and rubbery.  The filet was good and perfectly cooked, but I've had much better steak elsewhere.  And last, the sea bass wasn't the melt in your mouth buttery bite of heaven as I expected. 

The service is great. Everyone said congratulations since we had put that we were celebrating our engagement in the reservation details. Our server was super busy but she checked on us often. The ambiance is definitely strange as you're in a mall. It's really loud and not intimate at all. You're very close to other tables. Ours was right on the back of a booth, and the guys in that booth kept accidentally knocking over our table lamp. 

Overall, I'm really glad we tried it out, but will stick to our favorite next time we want to splurge on a dinner."}
{"text":"With a name like Mastro's in the name you can be assured that you will be satisfied. And satisfied we were on our annual outing with the Gumina family. Great food, good people and an all around great time. 

The staff was very quick to take care of us, our server was perfect and very attentive. Initially I was a little put off that they set our table in the lounge area, rather than the normal dining area. But I quickly changed my mind, as our group were a loud bunch and we were perfectly located. 

The food was all great! The cocktail prices are nothing outrageous. Everything from the seafood tower to the Halibut were great. (side note: the steak at City Hall is better, in my opinion) The dessert was my favorite part for sure. Everything was out of this world good. i wasn't sure where I was going to fit it in my stomach but I made room somehow, because after one bite of the butter cake and crembrule I was hooked."}
{"text":"this was my first time trying mastro's and I'm glad it was in vegas.  and let me tell you, everything here was expensive.  I probably won't be coming back but I'm glad I finally got to try it.

lobster mashed potatoes - it was actually pretty good!  the lobster taste and the mashed potatoes really mixed in well together.  I've heard that this dish wasn't as good in the costa mesa one

bone-in-filet - very tender and very good!

bone-in-kc strip - i loved it

i loved everything that was bone in.  I didn't get to try the bone-in-ribeye because it was too big

we also got a side of asparagus which is like $10 (not worth it).  although it was good, it tasted like I can cook this at home for so much cheaper, and it would taste the same.  nothing special at all"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was excellent.  My only issue is there isn't one person of color on the waitstaff."}
{"text":"LOVE, love, love this restaurant!  What a treat and a perfect way to end an already awesome Vegas trip.  This restaurant is located within the new City Center mall and was ultra convenient to get to from the Aria Hotel.  We started the night by sitting at the live Piano Bar in the lounge and ordering Pomegranate Martini's on dry ice.  The Martini's bubbled from the dry ice.  It was very cool and they were oh so good.

As far as the food goes... the meat is so tender and cooked to perfection.  My husband and I split an 18 oz. Bone-In Steak and it was more than we could possibly eat.  The steak was gigantic.  It was also really nice that they cut it for us and brought it out on two plates.  With 4 people we ordered 3 separate side dishes and it was way too much food.  One side will feed 3 - 4 people easily, but they are all so good you have to try more than one. 

By the time the chocolate birthday cake was served we were all so full that we had one bite and that was all but it was really good too.

The servers were really good and the atmosphere was perfect.  The tree house was really neat.

This is a definite must try.  Oh and I almost forgot... We shared the Lobster Bisque to start and it was the best ever.  We also really enjoyed the different breads in the basket.  I think the waitress said that the Pretzels come from Germany.  If you want an amazing dinner you have to try this place."}
{"text":"this mastros was awesome!  it does feel like you're in a treehouse :)
ok, let's start with the bread basket...forget the other breads, go straight for the pretzel one that is fresh out of the oven still hot and steamy
this party of six had the chilean sea bass, petit filet, ribeye, bone in filet which was all amazing! except for one that didnt really eat the bone in filet - it looked a little dry for medium (maybe he should have ordered medium rare)
for the sides, we had the lobster mashed potato which had big chunks of lobster on top
the sweet potato fries were soooo good and still a little al dente which was nice
the gongonzola mac n cheese was really cheesy and good!
sauteed spinach was garlicky
and of course you can't leave mastros without having the BUTTER CAKE!!!
service was top notch as always"}
{"text":"Hit up the Ocean Club for a work dinner with a bunch of others after a conference. Despite being in located in a mall and being a small chain, I had a good experience at Mastro's.

Liked:
+The wine list which was predictably extensive and expensive. Look closer and there are \"some\" decent values like a French Cremant at $10/glass for a generous pour
+My steak was very tender and flavorful. Even the \"petite\" filet is 8oz which ended up being quite large.

Indifferent To:
~I honestly thought the Butter Cake was \"meh\" - it was just too....unctuous I guess. I should expect that given the name but it just wasn't my jam. I was the exception because my party demolished that thing.
~The service is professional, with requisite white \"steakhouse waiter\" jackets. I could do without the clearly rehearsed patter though and I don't need to be reminded that medium on a steak is a \"warm red center\".

Disliked:
-Attendants in the restroom. I don't always bring my handbag with me and it's just awkward all the way around. No.
-Tables are way, way, way too close together. I shouldn't have to ask the person next to me to slide out so I can get up.

The crowd here is definitely interesting, especially once the (terrible) band gets going. Lots of spangly Chico's clad older ladies on the prowl and lots of on-the-third-divorce Regional Sales Managers."}
{"text":"Mastro's does hospitality right - I've been to their location in PHX as well and it seems that service training is very important to this group.

We went here just for dessert (Boss Man is a butter cake fiend) and sat in the bar area, but our service was as good as if we were ordering full dinners & bottles of expensive wine.

Don't take me to mean that anything here is cheap - that butter cake is going to be $16 but it's an absolutely enormous cake (like 6\" round) and served with a literal bucket of Chantilly cream. It's easily enough for 4-5 people or one person who's been jonesing for this cake. 

Their wine list is well chosen and a pretty good value as well, all things considered. I had a French Cremant & for $10 it was an extremely generous pour."}
{"text":"Tim was our lead server and he was the best !  We had 9 in our group celebrating 2 birthdays and an anniversary.  Starting dinner with 2 seafood towers best ever the variety of tastes served all of our palates!  Next the  Espresso Chocolate Martini was suburb, the steak, the sole and sides were excellent.   The dessert sinfully good. Especially, the butter cake.  
  When we go back we would skip some of the sides (just too much food). Otherwise atmosphere, food, service and experience was fantastic."}
{"text":"It was date night and I wanted some seafood! This place was suggested and I'm glad we went!

They had a live band so it was noisy but the energy was awesome. When coming to a place like this we know everything is going to be expensive but it is worth every penny.

We started with the calamari which was seasoned and cooked nicely. I ordered the king crab and a side of mac n cheese. My husband ordered the porter house and garlic mashed potatos. 

Best king crab I've had so far! And I have eaten a lot of king crab in my day! No need for butter and they'll crack it for you!  The porterhouse was so awesome, you could cut it with a butter knife. Tender, juicy, and flavorful. The sides are a good portion for sharing and we had plenty to take home for the next day.

Service was amazing at every point and it was a night to remember! 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent 

Came here with a party of 30 so I got to sample everything. We reserved their private dining room and it was fantastic. Service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show. 

Must have....... would be their seafood platter. It's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. It came with oysters, shrimp, king crab legs, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice. 

The bone in rib eye, bone in Kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Do not get the fish here. The sea bass was a little overcooked and dry. Then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse? 

Lobster mashed potatoes was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. I was told that this dish was featured in Entourage and a few other magazines. 

We celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. Their butter cake was to die for. My God that was good. Their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious."}
{"text":"They are good at taking a reservation but not honoring it. 8pm reservation on a random Wed and we waited over an hour. Ultimately the manager made it right so we will be back and give them another try."}
{"text":"This is a review of the bar only.

We stopped by for a cocktail on a Saturday night.  Drinks are outrageously expensive - $15 for a mojito? Give me a freakin' break!  

However, the high tariff is somewhat mitigated by the fact that a) they know how to make a drink here; b)  it's a truly beautiful bar; and c) it's like a glass-bottom boat tour of the mating rituals of North Scottsdale.   I mean, really.  You kind of have to see it to believe it.  Mrs. Wanderer and I sat in awe observing the scene unfolding in front of us.

I would try to describe it in more detail but if I started, I'd hit the Yelp character limit before I could do it justice.  Suffice it to say, it's a nonpareil anthropological experience."}
{"text":"Our party of six family chose Mastro's to celebrate my mother's 85th birthday.  It was a stunning experience from start to finish!  The room is just beautiful, with the careful engineering that dampers the sound so that even when the restaurant is full and bustling you can hold an intimate conversation at your own table.  The ages in our party ranged from a somewhat shy 16-year-old boy to my elderly mother - the servers were attentive, patient, respectful and engaging with all, and put everyone at ease.  The \"high-drama\" cocktails (some containing dry ice for an amazing display) were brought to the table with flair, as was the food which was delicious.  At every juncture we were made to feel that the staff was grateful that we were there - and the phone call the next day thanking us for having dined with them was an elegant and much appreciated touch."}
{"text":"Average at best! Seafood tower was one of the worst I ever had. Sea bass was dry and I agree with a previous reviewer on the rib-eye. One of the worst quality steaks. At first we thought the waiter made a mistake and brought the wrong steak.  To top it all off, my husband had the elderberry martini which was very good, however had a bug in it. Waiter took it back but no apology or anything. Sides were average. Overall I was expecting more from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a 4.5 star meal, but not quite 5 star, at Mastro's on a Friday night.  It was very crowded, as in full, but we were seated promptly at our reservation time of 8:00.  We were seated in a high top kind of half-booth type table.  I'd not sat in something like this before, but it was comfortable.  The place was humming, but since it's open to the mall, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.  

Our server immediately approached us to take our water and drink orders.  She also provided a wine list, which was above average but pricey, which was expected given that Mastro's is located in Crystals on the Strip.  I didn't think it was out of line with other lists at similar places on the Strip.  

To start, I went with the lobster bisque.  This was one of the best versions of this dish I've had.  It was velveety smooth with a lot of chunks of lobster.  The sherry came through, and it was seasoned very well.  Just a creamy lobstery soup.  You may get some sticker shock given that it's soup, but I think it was worth it (I can't recall the exact price, I believe it was either $16 or $18).  Additionally, a friend and I shared the ahi tuna tostada.  These come 3 to an order, but I could have easily eaten another dozen.  The tuna serving is substantial, and all of the accompaniments (avocado, onion salsa, and chili sauce) are fantastic.  Crispy, flavorful, but not too heavy.  Loved it.

We split steaks among the table, opting for the traditional bone in ribeye and the wagyu bone in ribeye from Australia.  It was $110, but well worth it.  It was noticeably better than the other steak.  Not that the \"regular\" ribeye wasn't good.  It was.  But, the depth of flavor with the wagyu was significantly better.  Absolutely re-order if they have it available.  Plus, since we were sharing they offered to cut it for us in the back of the house, which we appreciated.

On the side, we had the peppercorn steak sauce.  It's good, but I don't know that it's worthy of its reputation.  I didn't think the steaks needed it, so I only had a couple of bites with it.  The lobster mashed potatoes are incredibly decadent, nearly swimming in lobster and butter.  The twice baked potato is good, but it's typical for this type of dish.

For dessert, we went with the famous butter cake.  It easily lives up to its reputation.  Warm, a little crispy on the outside, but impossibly moist and buttery.  Served with berries, ice cream, and plenty of whipped cream, it was an excellent end to a great meal.  

Service was fantastic the entire time.  Our server was there when we needed her but not overbearing.  Our food came out quickly, but we never felt rushed, despite knowing how busy they were that evening.  All in all, a great experience.  I can see why Mastro's has its reputation, I would absolutely return."}
{"text":"This is was the first time that my wife and I stopped in dinner. We both ordered a fillet, one with a potato and the other with cream spinach. 

The steaks were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. Sides also cooked perfectly and had a great taste! Very fresh!

The service was over the top! We had Angie Burke as our server. She was super friendly and pleasant. Checked in several times and made sure glasses stayed full. She offered us their specialty cocktails. Las Vegas is all about hospitality and service and that's what Angie offered us."}
{"text":"Fuck this place.

It's my birthday today and we had reserved a \"quiet romantic table for two\" over a week ago. We arrived on time, yet we had to wait - not a problem since we understand they are busy. However, they took us to the middle of the main room. It was ridiculously loud... louder than any bar or concert I can remember being at. I couldn't hear from across the table. I couldn't hear the waiter either. 

We asked to be seated elsewhere - there were many areas that were more private and obviously quieter. They tried to accomidate - or at least they pretended to look busy as though they were going to accomidate. So we waited. We drank our \"still\" water and stared across the tabe at each other. We snacked on our bread.

... ONE HOUR LATER... we still had not been moved. We were tense and stressed out by all the noise... noise that could hardly be called 'ambient' - boisterous self-important blow-hards all talking over each other. The room lacks any sort of sound baffles or acoustic panels - a feature that would pretty much fix this problem.

After an hour of sipping on still water and nibbling on bread in the cafeteria for rich cunts and fake tits, with no sign of our promised and reserved table opening up, we decided to leave. We didn't get any resistance or much of an apology. In fact, they seemed happy they could have an open table to turn over. We asked how much we owed (nothing), tipped, and left.

Just because it's Superbowl week and I'm not P-Diddy, that doesn't mean I shouldn't get the table I reserved... my money is worth just as much as anyone elses. I find that their servers merely act as though they are busting their ass to kiss yours when in fact they aren't so interested in you as they would have you believe.

So anyway - in spite of this place having great wine selections at reasonable prices (considering the cost of the food), great pretzel bread, the illusion of great service, and good food (when they allow you to order it), I won't be going back. It's not worth the hassle. An hour is simply too long to wait for someone to take so much as a drink order. Plus... just fuck all of North Scottsdale in general... especially Kierland. It's like Dubai - looks good on paper and in pictures and in theory, but the reality is you wouldn't want to live anywhere near all those assholes.

I considered giving this place one star for ruining my birthday, but I figured it best to just take away one star... I reviewed this months ago and had given it 5 stars because I was rounding up from 4 and a half. This place really deserves the 3 stars. They need to communicate better... and pull their heads out of their asses. 

Original Review from 10.01.2007:

5 stars...
Fantastic seafood dishes... most places in the valley get it wrong, but this place does it right... Better than Wildfish, better than Steamers, better than Fish Market Restaurant, better than McCormick and Schmuck, even better than Sizzler. Hot damn. 

Service is top notch. Wine selection is great too... I had one of the best bottles of wine I've had in my life here. Pricey, but worth every penny. Every dish we had was amazing. 

Oh god, and the pretzel bread. I had to take some home with me. Something so simple, yet it's so damn good. 

Hate the location. Hate the crowd. Hate that it's so expensive... but the food is worth it and the atmosphere is beautiful. 

If you eat here twice a week, you have too much money - give me some."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. Food is exceptional. The butter cake is a must have for dessert. I love coming to this place. Definitely will be returning"}
{"text":"Liked it the first time so I made reservation to dine there 2nd time around.  Top notch qualify.  Steaks were great, seafoods were great, banana bread beer was awsome.  Chocolate dessert is to die for."}
{"text":"Very good experience staff was very attentive food was delicious.  I will highly recommend this to anyone wanting a good mill in Vegas"}
{"text":"Never disappointing!!!!
Kerrie was beyond amazing . She took such great care of us and took some genuine care into making sure our daughter (who has food allergies) was taken care of, 
Tuna Tostadas, Maguro Lime sushi, escargot , seared tuna, King Salmon all AMAZING!!!
Thank you Kerrie for taking some time to be so sweet and go the extra mile for our family and also to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary . 
We love Mastros and we were thrilled to bring our little ones with us this time! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to make this a special dinner because it was our 25th anniversary so we decided to go to Ocean Club. I made my reservations on Open Table and got a call from Mastro's to confirm my reservation. I knew this was going to cost me but what the heck it's a once in a lifetime marker in our lives. 

We walked in and were greet by three people. Seated promptly. Seemed pretty fancy. It was a little dark with the only light from the tinted windows. Server greeting us promptly and providing our drink orders. 

We started off with their bread basket and boy was the bread good. Really liked the pretzel roll the best but it was all really good. We were careful not to fill up on bread. Just so tempting. 

We ordered the calamari to start off. All rings and no legs. The sauce was really good. Not to spicy but really flavorful. The calamari was cooked perfect with a light breading. Really good and everyone enjoyed it a lot. 

I had the Chilean Sea Bass based on then Yelp reviews. Our server Shawn recommended Mastro's way to prepare it and all I know is  it was so good. It had a light crust on the fish and it was such a thick piece of fish. Cooked perfectly. Juicy, tender, and flaky. Really good. Recommend the sea bass any time. We ordered the side of sugar snap peas and boy were those good. Probably the best I've had. Cooked perfectly. Tender, fresh and just melt in your mouth good. I really couldn't get enough of those. Everyone loved it. Then my son wanted some shoestring potatoes cause he had them at Dominic's and he wanted to try these. These were really crispy and really good. The portion was so big we couldn't finish them. 

My wife got the swordfish steak which came with two fairly big pieces. Really tender but not as tender as the sea bass. Juicy and fresh. She liked it a lot and i tried it and it was pretty good. 

My son (yes, he joined us too) ordered the 12oz Filet and it was pretty big and thick. When he was cutting it, you could tell it was tender. It was like cutting butter. He liked it a lot. I didn't get to try it cause I was so full. Couldn't eat another bite. Looked nice and juicy. Cooked perfectly. No issues here. 

I know I said I was fully and so was everyone else but we just had to try their dessert. We always share so we ordered the warm butter cake and told them it's our anniversary. It came on a nice big plate wishing us a happy anniversary. Really nicely decorated. Melt in your mouth goodness. Really good butter cake with slivers of fresh fruit and homemade whip cream. Boy was that good. Little crispy on the edges. Moist and warm with ice cream on top. So good. The best part is that it was on the house cause of our anniversary. 

Service was excellent. Filling our water glasses and ice tea all the time. Making sure everything was okay and even having the manger come by to check on us. Really good service. They took our plates off in a timely manner and clear the crumbs off our table. Very very good service. They even have someone in the bathrooms to help you out and serve you there too. 

So this isn't a place I can visit on a regular basis cause it really expensive but nice for special occasions. Great service, really good food. Fresh. The ambiance was so calm yet elegant (if that makes sense). Noise level was okay, just depending on the tables around you. So we had a really nice Anniversary dinner and enjoyed it a lot. I will probably be back for another special occasion. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great food as always.  Our server Elizabeth was perfect.  She was very attentive and literally went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed or if we wanted anything else.  The steaks are by far always the best!  The setting in the Mall there I found to be quite loud and not the typical high end feeling you get at their other places.  What drew us there was the food and they definitely were spot on there!  5 stars for the food."}
{"text":"Fantastic in all respects. Would have given 5 stars if red wine had not been a bit too chilled for my taste."}
{"text":"I really like Mastro's.  

The service is excellent! They are attentive without being snobby and cold.  And you don't get pressured to order more food and bottle of wine.  (I personally think that Cut has the cold, snobby vibe that I'm referring to)

Highly recommend the whole dining experience, but I also love going to grab a glass of wine at the bar.  The bar has an open feeling that is very comfortable, but with an intimate vibe.

Food is good.  Nicely prepared and cooked to perfection.  Nothing crazy on the menu or super unique so its an easy crowd pleaser.  

Price is on target as well for their quality of food. They don't push you to buy bottles of wine or spend a ton of money.  The servers are just there to give you what you ask for.  I never felt pressured to get more food and spend a ton. 

By the way, if you're local they have a free dessert!  They're so generous with the portion size and its so delicious.  This definitely helps when I'm deciding where to go.

We love our restaurants that support their locals!"}
{"text":"Two friends joined me for a Sunday evening dinner and drinks. I have been to Mastro's many times and have never been disappointed. The live music in the lounge was so very good, we stayed there in the bar area for dinner and loved it. We ordered our favorites: Red wine, their famous Martinis (exceptional Martinis), the seafood appetizer, Tomahawk steak (not on the menu-just ask your server about it, that incredible steak was enough for all 3 of us) with Lobster Mashed Potatoes (out of this world) and for dessert the butter cake (a must have). All were magnificent. Mastro's really has it down, amazing food and excellent service, my personal favorite place, always an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Mastro's is a classic favorite of ours that never fails. We ordered the classic Caesar salad, lobster bisque, two petite filets (medium) with truffle sauce, and the macaroni and cheese. The only down side to the meal was that everything seemed to be VERY salty.

Service and atmosphere was impeccable as always."}
{"text":"Great Seafood & Steakhouse in Kierland area in Scottsdale.  My only criticism are tables are too close to each other if you want privacy.  Dine @ Mastro instead @ North Scottsdale location instead."}
{"text":"We loved this restaurant for my birthday! The food was superb and the service was impeccable. Mike was our waiter and he was very patient and funny. He paid attention to details.  The windows folded back and the cool breezes came in. It was the perfect setting. They gave us birthday cake that was so moist and fun with a candle and happy birthday written on the place with chocolate icing.
Thank you Mike!!"}
{"text":"Mastro's is the best steakhouse I've ever been to. I've been to a lot of locations (Newport Beach, Malibu, Beverly Hills, Palm Desert, Las Vegas, All 3 AZ locations) and it's NEVER been anything but the best. The service, the food, the entire experience from start to finish puts all other restaurants to shame. In fact, I find myself often saying in regards to other restaurants \"It was good, but it wasn't Mastro's\"   :)"}
{"text":"As far as Arizona goes this is good seafood, but compared to other cities I've been to where seafood restaurants are more abundant, Ocean Club is nothing special. I do like the ambiance of the restaurant and the service typically seems to be fine, but for the price I'd rather go to another one of the more expensive places that Phoenix/Scottsdale has to offer, even in the Kierland Commons area. 

I have eaten here probably 3 or 4 times and never been blown away by anything I have had. My main issue with some of the seafood dishes is that there is too much added flavor (sauces, etc). 

Bottom line is if I'm going to spend $30+ on entrees there are about 10 other places I can think of off the top of my head I'd rather go."}
{"text":"If you're short on time and/or simply not a big fan of the written word, let me start this review with all you really need to know about Mastro's: BUTTER. CAKE.  That's it.  5 stars for the best cake I've ever had.

Ok, now on to the merely trifling details.
I made a reservation several weeks in advance as my boyfriend and I were headed to Vegas on Labor Day weekend for his birthday.  I requested a table in the \"tree house\" (I called it the birdcage or something equally gauche) and noted the occasion.

We arrived and were told they were preparing \"one of the best tables\" in the birdcage--that we could sit at the bar for a few minutes or be seated promptly at another table.  Obviously we hit the bar which, it bears noting, is visually interesting with a HUGE inventory of top shelf liquors stacked all the way to the ceiling.
I had the Mastro's Martini--Belvedere vodka with handstuffed blue cheese olives.  Sweet jesus.  Hands down, best martini I've ever had.  Three days later, I'm still thinking about those olives.

Didn't even finish my drink before the hostess, a sweet, bubbly thing, took us to our table.  Situated on the perimeter of the birdcage, it was a great table.  Yes, it's a mall, so our view included Louis Vuitton and a hoard of assholes who had just evidently exited the Elvis show but, whatever.  It's Vegas.  Plus, I liked the change-up from the normal casino venue which meant I got non-smoky air for a full 3 hours.

Our meal, start to finish, was fabulous, perhaps only outdone by the impeccably rendered service.  A special shout out goes to our main server, Matt, whose plesant demeanor, attentive service and knowledge of the menu (and wine list) were truly something special.

We started with a custom seafood tower.  Wanting to save room for the steak, we went modest with 3 shrimp (HUGE), an order of Dungeness crab cocktail (the best cold crab I've ever had) and 1/2 dozen Kumamoto oysters.  The dry ice effect and caper berry garnish were nice touches but the star of the tower was the hand grated horseradish.  When was the last time you noticed and RAVED about horseradish?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I will never buy the jarred stuff again.

Moving on to the main attraction: I went with the 12 oz bone in-filet and boyfriend got the Kansas City.  We both preferred mine as it offered a better combination of buttery tenderness and intense meaty flavor.  He would do the ribeye if he had to do it over again but he was by no means dissatisfied with his steak.
For sides we selected snap beas, glossed in simple butter, creamed corn ,which mercifully left large kernels of corn intact, and an order of the matchstick fries (sans vinegar).

Two TINY complaints:
(1) Upon seating, we received the \"Reserve Wine List\" which the BF deemed VERY high priced--not a single bottle under $100.  A few things we could buy for $150 at the store were priced at $900 and up.  1000% = excessive mark-up.  Nevertheless, he picked a nice bottle of red that he thought was reasonable.  When the menu came, about 10 minutes later, the left hand side had an enormous list of wines of the style and prices ($100-200) you'd expect at a standard steakhouse.  Would have been nice to have seen that list when we were ordering.  Might have been an isolated timing thing but worth pointing out.

(2) Our first order of fries came out and were basically salt sticks.  And I LOVE me some salt.  I could barely eat these.  The manager came by and I made a casual comment about them.  He said he'd have the kitchen do a fresh batch but would leave us the salt bombs until the new batch was ready.  VERY nice touch, in my opinion.  Because of course we kept eating them.  Second batch was perfectly seasoned and the manager seemed to recognize that the kitchen can get a little heavy handed with them.

These two missteps in no way took away from how much we enjoyed our experience at Mastro's.

Last but NOT least (since it already got a plug at the outset of this review), Mastro's blew us away with the complimentary butter cake--served on a personalized plate (\"Happy Birthday Rob!\").  I've since seen some recipes for this cake and I'm really sorry I did.  I could hear my arteries clogging as I ate this, but man it was worth it.  One of those items where you take a bite, laugh at the insane delectability, take another bite, and chuckle some more.  For me, there is no better mark of good food than laughter. 

I found the prices high, but totally on par for what I expected in Vegas.  And, in fact, to the dollar, the amount we spent on Nobu the night before (with cocktails but no wine).
We'll definitely be coming back here.  And will hopefully be seated in Matt's section.
Oh, and the table next to us (3 couples) spent most of the evening talking about bra sizes and dirty Sanchezes.  Can't beat that for entertainment."}
{"text":"Mastros wins on all aspects FOOD, Atmosphere and incredible service. The best place to sit is in the tree house that extends in the center of the mall, never seen anything like it.  The shellfish towers are awesome, you get to pick what you want on it...ie...alacart shellfish. If you go through all meal courses it will cost you a few bucks but worth the expense."}
{"text":"I ate here the other night and the service was fantastic. One person that stood out the most was Phil. Phil made sure that I got everything that I needed and was very attentive. If you decide to dine here, I highly recomend sitting in phils section."}
{"text":"Great food. I am not rich so I would not come here if it weren't for a gift card I received from the Vdara hotel. It's your typical over the top priced steak house. The service was great as you would expect. My meal was delicious. However, for the price I would probably go to outback instead. Sure this place was waaaay better but $173 for two people to eat a steak and vegetables?  Out of my league."}
{"text":"I made reservations a few days in advance.  I dressed up to go to dinner but many people were dressed casual wearing shorts and flip flops.  Ronald was our waiter for the evening.  I ordered the mussels and mashed potatoes.  They were really good.  The serving of mashed potatoes is enough to feed several people. The broth for the mussels was seasoned and not too salty.  I loved the lemon that was served in bags to catch the seeds.  The salmon was good but it could have used more flavoring.  My key lime martini was the most I have ever paid for a cocktail but I got two drinks out of the shaker and it was delicious.  For dessert the butter cake was very sweet but I saved half and ate it the next day.  The gigantic dish of whipped cream served with it is impossible to eat!  The tree house was interesting to dine in.  I wish Mastro's had a location in the Southeast so I could celebrate there more than once a year."}
{"text":"I think Mastro's has good food, but the food itself is not worth the price.  You are really paying extra in exchange for the privilege of eating your dinner inside of a giant, 3-D artist's rendition of a tree house.  It's still pretty good though.  I got the big bone-in fillet, creamed spinach, and club house salad.  The house salad has shrimps and crab in it.  It's quite good.  The warm butter cake is OK.  I thought the grain was coarse and the flavor was just \"yellow\".  I dunno, it's just not as good as everyone keeps saying.  But I still gave it four stars for the architecture."}
{"text":"It's restaurant week in Vegas. Saw Mastro's was participating.  Great deal for $50 per person.  I recommend the Mambo salad.  Really unique ask about it. Enjoyed the 8ounce filet, it was perfect! Mine and my wife's. Med rare!  I usually order bone in steaks for the extra flavor, but wow this really had a lot of flavor and didn't taste over seasoned. I we be back and can hardly wait until the newest location opens in Palm Desert Ca. In November!   Keep up the good work. You are tops in my book!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, gorgeous entry, always a crowd.  Last time we went, though the husband and I were just annoyed.  

Ordered a great bottle of wine, asked about seafood appetizers, making sure we let the waiter know we didn't want the ginormous seafood tower and whaduyaknow, we got the darned tower on our itty bitty table.  Couldn't see each other the first half of the meal.  

Would've been totally funny if we could've gotten the waiter to stop acting so stuffy. By the end of the dinner (around $300), weren't even in the mood to watch the pick up scene (older crowd - entertaining, though) in the main bar area. Will go back-might try to get a (bigger) table, though."}
{"text":"I decided on this place for my boyfriends birthday because he loves steak and I love seafood. He tried to convince me to go somewhere cheaper but I wouldnt allow it. At first I was not a fan of our server- took about 15 minutes to get menu's and an introduction. I think he heard me bitching about it because after that he went out of his way to attend to us. He was an odd fellow but he was trying very hard. I am a sucker for expensive glasses of wine and love it when a restaurant offers such- The server gave a very on point description of the wine I ordered. For entree I had the sea bass and my boyfriend had steak- something with a bone in it- I guess the rib eye? Im not sure about that as I dont eat beef...I was loving my sea bass until my darling mentioned that his steak was extremely salty...and in that moment I noticed that mine was also extremely salty...and I LOVE salt. The sea bass was cooked to perfection and was so flaky and delicious with just the perfect amount of crust on the outside. But- it was almost too salty to eat. My boyfriend said the same thing about the steak- that it was perfectly cooked and a great piece of meat but too salty to really enjoy. 

Overall the meal cost me an arm and at least 2 legs...Service B+, Wine A+, Entree C, Bread A+, Price for what you get C+."}
{"text":"Mastro's had the blessing and the curse of being my second \"fine dining\" experience.

I appreciated the tap water so much more since I had been charged for a super-bougie bottle at Gordon Ramsay Steak.

The attentiveness of our waitress was exceptional. During the dinner rush, our meals got lost in the shuffle and when she realized we were still not served (bout an hour in), she made sure we wouldn't wait much longer. Our food was out  of the kitchen quite quick.

I started with the lobster bisque and it was incredible. Best lobster bisque I've ever had, hands down.

The steaks were very good. I'd say that they are much better than 95% of the steaks I've ever had.

I was divided on the sides. The sautéed broccoli was nothing special. It did a very good job of tasting like broccoli. However, the gnocchi was incredible. I could eat it all day, every day.

My sugar loving girlfriend was in love with the butter cake. It really was delicious, and that comes from someone who isn't into really into desserts.

Overall, not a bad experience. I'll definitely be up for a return."}
{"text":"Ok...I have been to the Ocean Club in the past and had great food...but this last Saturday night was the WORST!!  First off, the table they wanted to set us at was right by the waiters door...  Yes, we had reservations and still this is where they wanted us to sit!  OK...I understand the out of towner's are here, but us locals who dine out at least twice a week year round keep you open when it is 110 outside.   They did seat us at another table after we refused to sit by the door; but were reluctant even though there were 3 tables with reserved signs but no one sitting at them nor did anyone sit at for 15 minutes after us.  The waiter was nice and recommended a Grouper with bearnaise sauce; sounded good right?  Just let me say it was chewy and the sauce was not as good as the packet version you can buy in the store for a BUCK!  OK maybe it was just me???  Wrong my friends dish was just as bad...a runny watered down lemon sauce more like lemon aid with sole fish swimming in the water down sauce.  I don't want to sound negative but Eddie V's fish taco's for $18 dollars or their Chilean Sea Bass are much better and you don't mind spending &45.00 for it.  I took my fish home and even my dog turned his nose up at it!  

On a nice note...the pretzel bread is good."}
{"text":"Outstanding dining experience. Service was excellent, and the parmesan crusted Grouper was possibly the best seafood dish I've ever eaten. Well definitely return."}
{"text":"Great dining! Very good Service! The food is delicious, get the bon in fillet steak 18oz with string beans and almonds, and mash potatoes! Chef knows what he is doing!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great experience!  Mastro's is definitely a once in a lifetime place to eat.  

From my initial phone call with Britney, I knew this place was first class.  She was very friendly and helpful.

We arrived a little early for our dinner and they seated us in the Treehouse!  Awesome decor

Tim was our server and he was friendly and very helpful with our selections.  

We ordered both steaks and fish.  All the entrees come a la carte.  The steaks were steaming hot as they arrived.  Melted in your mouth!  My sea bass was delicious.  

For the sides, make sure you get the mac & cheese, delicious!  We also had the sweet potato fries which were crispy and the broccoli.  The hot bread was also very delicious.

With no alcohol, our dinner for four was $275 plus tip.  Not an everyday place but definitely a once in Vegas trip.

The next morning Zach called us to follow up on our experience, I have never had this happen from a restaurant ever!  Nice touch"}
{"text":"Excellent location at crystals aria and excellent food .this is my spot when I have visitors from out of town ."}
{"text":"Every time i hear Mastros i always crave for everything in this restaurant. Servers are amazing! Some of the hostess' are amazingly nice some of them are okay.. everything is good in this restaurant.. i always order Bone in rib eye (YUM!), Lobster mashed potatoes and Lobster bisque. just an FYI, if you're gonna have a huge party with you the side dishes is good for 4 people! which is really great :)"}
{"text":"We took friends from out of town here last night and the overall experience was good.  Bartender and our server were both excellent. The prices are extraordinarily high by any measure. Lobster mashed potatoes were good but not great. All in all it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant needs 10 stars in service, ambiance and of course the food. This was my favorite dinner while in LV,  and Trista our waitress made the night even better! We had the hamachi with truffles, the bone marrow. For dinner we had the Chilean sea bass blackened. Now, the Item of the night for me was the lobster mashed potatoes!!! I would have a bowl of that daily if I could! The dessert was a representation of the perfect creme brûlée, seriously delicious! Overall, it was our best dinner in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I heard so many good things about this restaurant. I finally treid it, expecting too much.. I was a bit dissapointed. Service was horrible.. You would think for a nice place it would be pristine. They served my mash potatoes on my plate like it was PRISON FOOD and served the rest of my party the same way. The food was ok not that amazing. I had the Salmon with mash and maccaroni, kinda pricey for the service you get. The food quantity was alot i must admit but it did not WOW me as much. I woudlnt reccomend this place, but if you like to try new restaurants like myself i would check it off my list."}
{"text":"A little disappointed since everyone I've talk to raves about how amazing the food is there. For the most part the food there is great but everything is drench in butter. I had ordered the bone in ribeye steak and it was cooked perfectly except that I couldn't taste the meat. All I could taste was butter. There was so much butter that it took brushing my teeth twice to get the butter taste out of my mouth. I honestly felt like I ate a stick of butter. Other then that the rest was amazing. The staff was exceptional!! The atmosphere was decent on a week night. Not too crowded and not too noisy. Having live music is always nice. To be honest I probably won't be eating there anytime soon. :("}
{"text":"Hearing about my preivous  dining experience. Masto's General Manager Dan Boyer, invited me back to dine in on a regular night and me and my wife take the opportunity and did. Our server Amanda was very sharp and very attentive to details.

My steak was cook to perfection and my wife seabass's were melt in your mouth goodness. Great attentive staff, absolutely great customer service. A top of the class experience if you ask me.

Stop by at Mastros Ocean Club, its not just a restaurant, it want you to be part of their club or family."}
{"text":"Went there with some coworkers. Outstanding service and food. The steaks are amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely an upscale restaurant, Ocean Club is a fantastic choice for a great dinner and a fun night out. The bar area is always hoppin' so even if you just want to pop in for a few drinks, expect a wait and an even harder time finding a table.  If you're there for dinner, the service varies- sometimes I get a server that is overly attentive and then other times I barely see him or her. 
The fish is fantastic and I've heard the crab legs are even better.
The location is cool, because depending on what time you're done with dinner, you can walk around Kierland and check out the shops."}
{"text":"Totally Overrated, We were looking for \"the best Chilean Seabass in las vegas\" since we are lovers of that delicious, buttery and tasty fish, and we decided to go fancy and chose mastros for their excellent reviews, the attention is perfect, the service is super nice, their wine list is spectacular, we ordered the ahi tuna tartar... frozen tuna, kinda tasteless, I would rate it a 6 out of 10, and after that we ordered the truffle king crab gnocchi... that is the best I've ever had! 
And we ordered the Chardonnay to make a nice pairing with the Chilean seabass... we chose the pan seared crust, which we love! But this time they actually served it as a shoe sole, completely fibrous, Tasteless, horrible... I complained and the waitress kindly changed it to us, second try was grilled... and it was raw and frozen on the inside.... AWFUL yet uncomfortable to eat that fish raw! They gave us the butter cake (awesome cake!!!!) as a gift but they charged the Chilean seabass.... that was the worse $150 and luxury night wasted for a seabass diner. 
The restaurant is amazing, but the food Is just okay, never would recommend it as the best Chilean seabass in any place."}
{"text":"I am usually a regular at The Old Homestead in Ceasers, but this place had a high rating and the date I was with, who was looking awesome dressed in a miniskirt and hooker heels, convinced me with the innuendo of sexual favors to try something new, so as a sexually charged male, I obliged. Mario, our server, was awesome. He hooked us up with a great wine and had some menu suggestions that would make anyones heart flutter. The bread basket was phenomenal and the staff we could see was very professional and classy. However, the staff we couldn't see undermined all forward progress made by the men in white suits. The steaks were overcooked, the scalloped potatoes were sour and cold, and the timing of the food was as coordinated as the Dallas Cowboys 2015 offensive line, or any play by the detroit lions since 1976. Its worth a try, but I would have rather gone somewhere else."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a solid choice for an evening of fine dining. But there are a few annoyances keeping it from being 5 star.

We walked in with no reservations but it was early and we were sat immediately. We were escorted to a table outside the bird nest, which wouldn't be a big deal if they were not playing the most awful fine dining lounge music ever. After requesting a new table there was some initial resistance but eventually they sat us in the birds nest which thankfully has traditional dining background tunes. - 1 star

The service was quick and friendly though we ordered way too much food. I don't feel we were properly warned about the portion sizes of the side items. There was easily more than a pound of food left uneaten. But what we did eat was good enough to avoid losing another star. Simply put it was all around delicious. Judging by what we had, the dishes I watched go past me, and the reaction of the other diners... close your eyes and pick anything you want... it will be great.

In summery, great food, good service, $$$-$$$$, but-

 Unless you want to bring earplugs to dinner, be sure to get a table in the birds nest!"}
{"text":"Great food, music, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"The restaurnt serves superb seafood and steaks. The ambience, service and execution are as good as it gets. During the course of dinner I had the unfortunate experience of choking on a piece of the steak-all my fault. As it happened the General Manager,Frank Schneider, happened to see I was in trouble. He sprung into action and the offending piece popped out. The man saved my life and I am truely grateful. That's service and dedication."}
{"text":"Love the food, service and live music. Great people watching in the bar area as well. Everyone is always pretty friendly."}
{"text":"I've always said that you can judge a restaurant by it's bread as an indication of it's food. The bread basket at this particular Mastro's was a bad omen in itself. 

I've better had better escargot's at a Vietnamese restaurant in Little Saigon. My Chilean Seabass was a tragedy, usually my favorite fish. It had to be the oil or butter that they pan seared it in that tastes like gasoline and left me nauseated. It was the fist time I left Chilean Seabass half eaten.
The shoe string fries was mostly fried in the same horrific lard. Even ketchup couldn't salvage the flavor.

The mushrooms were good but my nausea keep me for enjoying them. 

The 18 oz bone in filet was had no character what so ever. Such a disappointment compared to other Mastro's that we dined at.

I've had good steaks at good restaurants. This place isn't it."}
{"text":"Still outstanding.

Seafood, expertly prepared served in a contemporary tree house in the middle of the desert.  It never gets old.   All this from a chain restaurant.

The fish version of a steakhouse.  Large filet cuts of fresh fish, simply seasoned and grilled.  No swimming in sauces, no embellishments on the plate.  Sides, like at a steakhouse are ordered separately and meant to be  shared.

The food; this isn't a sushi restaurant or a steakhouse.  Nuff said.

Classic cold starters from perfectly cooked and chilled jumbo (U8) shrimp, sweet chunks of Dungeness crab leg meat, chunks of just cooked through lobster all served with a zesty cocktail sauce are all excellent.  

For something warm, the sautéed day boat sea scallops, ocean candy.  Perfect sear, mid rare, enhanced with a bit of butter and squeeze of lemon.  Also consider sharing the Vanilla battered lobster (a main).  Sounds weird, but the vanilla imparts an indescribable flavor that heightens the oceanic sweetness of the lobster.  The light tempura style batter provides a hint of textural contrast.

Mains are all about the fish.  The Scottish salmon, simply seasoned and grilled medium is outstanding.  Loaded with creamy fat that carries the unmistakable sweet flavor of salmon.  The flavor goes on and on.  The Crusted Chilean sea bass cooked medium well is equally good.  Large flakes of moist, tender flesh oozing oceanic fattiness.   

Save room for sides.  The lobster mashed potatoes remains excellent.  Seemingly more lobster than potato.  Perfectly cooked, large chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery, mash, whole claws thrown in for good measure.  Sinfully delicious.  The Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi, wow.  50 percent sweet king crab meat, 50 percent pillowy gnocchi in a delicate cream sauce imbued with black truffle oil and bits.  Aggressively seasoned but it works to heighten the umame finish that makes whatever piece of grilled fish accompanying it explode with flavor.

Very good wine program.  Typical Vegas resort markup.

Excellent steakhouse (I know) service.

Sometimes simple is best."}
{"text":"I have a favorite place to celebrate my birthday every year now!!! Best cake ive ever had in a restaurant. Food was delicious. My husband and i both had lamb. Customer service was great. What more can i ask for."}
{"text":"Delicious! We came for \"Linner\" and I just wish I was hungrier! At Morel's in the Palazzo, we met the most amazing waiter and totally chatted it up with him. He let us know that he also works at Mastro's Ocean Club so we also had to go visit him there...

This restaurant is gorgeous to look at and basically looks like a tree house with the Crystal's shopping area of City Center. It's gorgeous!

We started with amazing cappuccinos in the bar area since our favorite waiter, Dion, was not quite ready yet. I noticed that a cocktail that one girl in the bar was drinking was \"smoking\"... I think they put dry ice in it for effect!

When we were seated for lunch, we ordered the fried onion strings as an appetizer and the escargot. The bread including \"pretzel bread\" was a great appetizer too. The onion string serving size was HUGE and could have fed about 8 people. The escargot were in amazing sauce that I dipped my bread into afterward! 

Then, I ordered the Cobb salad that came with a generous serving of huge prawns; it was delicious! He had the sea bass with the light bread crumb preparation and it was also amazing! We also shared the house mashed potatoes that included scallions, bacon, etc mixed in and were rich and delicious. 

What a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport! It was tough to leave Vegas after an amazing meal like that though!"}
{"text":"Not that this restaurant needs anymore reviews...
So, I'll keep it short and sweet.

I've been to this place twice now. It's awesome. Hands down the best place for seafood I've been to in Vegas. 

Awesome service, love the ambiance and they have the yummiest breads.

I would suggest:
Lobster Mashed potatoes
Crab
Crab Cakes
Black Truffle Gnocchi
Chilean Sea bass

If you want a fancy dinner and you're dressed to impress, this would be a lovely place to hit up. Just make reservations :)"}
{"text":"I'll save you some time from reading and cut to the chase:

1. Request the Tree House
2. Cocktail: Mastro Mojito
3. Appetizer: Mastro's Seafood Tower (if you're a group of 4 or more, it's big)
4. Side: Lobster Mashed Potatoes
5. Entree: Bone-in Ribeye, medium-rare.  The Chilean Sea Bass is actually pretty good but c'mon this is Mastros!
6. Dessert: Warm butter cake

7. Walk it off at the Cosmopolitan next door.

If you're eating here, I'm happy for you!"}
{"text":"hey this place aint too shabby.   Yea its located inside city center aka the shopping mall.  Yea the noise outside the restaurant can get loud what do you expect from a restaurant literally located in the center of the mall?

anywho heres the review----

highlight of the night has to be the awesome lounge singer.  He did a standout job as we were waiting for our table to be seated.

Kindly took our request for Rick Astley \"Never Gonna Give You Up\"

AKA 'Rick Roll'd'   Did a fantastic job.

For that the restaurant gets the full 5 star it deserves.

Oh the food?  it was good I had a rack of lamb that was outstanding!  Besides that the lounge singer stole the show! BOoooo yah!"}
{"text":"I first must preface this with the fact that I've eaten at numerous steakhouses in the city and also know how to cook - I can't say the same for the present chef here. First, this mastros is in a mall so I can expect that they are most likely hiring inferior kitchen staff. They also let some dude in with a tank top shirt on in the restaurant and you'd think theyd at least tell him to have more appropriate attire on. Also If you associate your name with being a top tier steakhouse and you completely and absolutely fuck up the steak it's very disappointing especially with the price point. Our server came over and asked to bring out our dinners early cause they were already prepared. Never ever heard this before from a superior steakhouse. The item was delivered no joke cold to the touch and completely raw when I cut it open. Completely raw. I ordered medium rare plus and any chef who is any bit noteworthy knows what the hell that means. More so who in the hell is checking to make sure the sous chefs are cooking everything right before sending out?! The head chef who has a damn temp stick. The only reason this got two stars is cause the management gentlemen was professional and realized the present chef is better off at Cheesecake Factory. It ruined our night out. Also to note the servers and bus boys are very good. I hope this review helps management figure out when you charge that much hire a chef who has experience."}
{"text":"We walked by the place early last week while shopping and exploring the City Center.  Love the ambiance, menu looked great, have heard great things about other locations so we decided to make this our last nights meal in Vegas.  Glad we did because aside from Mix, and JR's this has now become one of our favorite places in Vegas. I would not hesitate to recommend. 

Seated in the main dining area right in the middle of the coolest structure for a restaurant you will ever see. Warm dining room, very welcoming as were the staff. Ours were a attractive redhead young lady and a younger guy.  Piano playing jazzy christmas tunes, nice touch.  Immediate introduction by the servers, it looked as if there were two for every table. We started with the house special martinis, served chilled and shaken at the table and blended perfectly. Really, perfectly.  Scanned the menu,  server came back by to check on the drinks and announced the specials. Decided on the following:

Sautéed Sea Scallops
Warm Spinach Salad
Chilean Sea Bass
NY Strip w/o bone
Lobster Mashed 

Scallops arrived, great presentation. Now I love scallops, being in the PNW we have lots of choices on seafood and some of the best scallops I have ever had are at the barking frog near the Woodinville winery and home of the famous Herbfarm. These were excellent, large but not too, perfectly seasoned and prepared. All sitting on tip of the most wonderful cheese bread cracker in a wonderful sauce. Yum! 

Salad arrived, again great presentation, just made, plate warmed just enough you could smell all the ingredients. Now this was key. Onion, egg, bacon and greens all perfectly aligned to emit this wonderful fragrance that just made your mouth water.  None of the heat or tartness you sometimes get with places putting too much red vinegar on the greens.  And the taste, I shit you not this was the best salad I have ever tasted. The senses alive with the fragrance and the taste perfectly aligned. 

Steak and bass arrived, simple but elegant in preso.  Bowl of steaming potatoes with over a pound of lobster and a beautiful sauce. Steak done to perfection, one of the best cuts and flavors I have had. And I am a steak house freak.  Steak was severed still sizzling on the plate, little bit of butter on top on a simple white plate.  Wife's Sea bass was served equally as elegant. Simply in presentation, nice cut of fish perfect flavor.  

Service was just right, friendly, genuine there when needed. Asked the server to choose a wine for me to pair with the steak. Perfect choice came back again.

I don't work for this place, wish I owned stock or had ownership though. This was by far one of the best dining experiences we have had all year. We will be back. 

Thanks to the wonderful staff and happy holidays!"}
{"text":"Everything here was spectacular from beginning to end. I went here for dinner on a Friday evening. The restaurant itself is located inside of Crystals in an open area of the shopping center. Despite the open area, the atmosphere was still very nice and the live music really added to it.

My Experience:
Starters
-The bread was pretty good
-The Shrimp Cocktail was delicious and the horseradish was spicy!

Main Course & Sides
-I ordered the Filet, and having dined at another steakhouse earlier in the week, I must say, the filet here was incredible. This was probably one of the best filets I have ever had!
-The sides were just as amazing. We had the mac and cheese, green beans with almonds, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn. I would recommend all of them as there wasn't one I did not like.

Dessert
-I'm not a huge sweets guy, but I was told that I HAD to try the Butter Cake even though we were already stuffed. It definitely lived up to the hype as a MUST TRY dessert!

Overall, I had a great dining experience here. Our waiter was awesome and we never felt rushed. I would HIGHLY recommend trying this place next time you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"After living in Vegas for about a year, this is easily the most disappointing high end meal I've had.  I'd give the food a 4/5 but the service was probably a 1/5.

Service
The first disappointment was waiting.  We had a reservation and even so I can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  However, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  Our \"leader\" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  That didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of \"oh, I'm sorry I thought they came and got you.\"

Maybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  However, things didn't get better from there.  It seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  Easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  It just felt like everything was so slow.  After the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  I mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  I think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.

If you look at the prices at Mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  We got none of that.  I would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  You aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are \"good\".  We asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like \"what do you mean\"?  I mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  There is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks....\"oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled\"....thanks.

This was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  During the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.

I will say that the food was good.  The steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  Usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  The asparagus was nothing special.  The lobster mashed potatoes were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  Crab gnocchi was good, but I'm not crazy about gnocchi so I'm not an expert.  The problem in Vegas is that you can find a place equal to Mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.

Needless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  With so many other options in town for steak I probably wouldn't come back for that.  I will say I tried the ahi tuna sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  I didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  I would come back if I was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better."}
{"text":"And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life at...MASTRO'S OCEAN CLUB! - Miley Cyrus (we can't stop)

I made reservations here the day of as I wanted to watch a cirque show but didn't know if we wanted to watch the earlier or the later showing. No problems here, as Mastro's was very accommodating. When I came to check in, they were already aware that I had a two hour window before the show and made sure I'd be good to go. Off to a great start!

Seeing as I didn't eat any steak earlier in the trip, I had to get one here. It was super tasty and although a little closer to medium than medium rare, turned out to be just as fantastic. The chilean sea bass, which many yelpers have gotten, is excellent pan seared and a good sized portion as well. We also ordered sides of the lobster mashed potatoes and a half order of the Alaskan crab black truffle gnocchi. Both were served table side and both had huge chunks of lobster and king crab, respectively.

With about half an hour to go, our waitress knew about our showtime as well and brought us out the signature butter cake, which is a must order here. You're in Vegas; this thing is crazy buttery but oh man, you have to try it. If I'm staying at the Aria again next time, I would order this dessert to go to take back to the room.

Huge thumbs up for excellent service and the live music was fun and we got on our way on time. With a very cool atmosphere and location, I want to thank Mastro's for a memorable meal, I approve!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the night entertainment.  The pianist and the red-headed lady were just awesome.  It was very high in energy and the crowd was sophisticated but casual.  The food was great, I had the 22oz bone-in rib eye, only finished about 7oz of it.  I highly recommend the creamed corn and the lobster mashed potatoes for sides.  Order the Old Earth Cab to compliment the steak and it was just delicious, not dry at all.  To finish dinner off, I shared the creme brulee and it was delicious!  Service was pretty good, except when our water cup was left unfilled towards the end of dinner, so I had to knock off a star for that.  All-in-all, I will definitely be back to enjoy the food and entertainment."}
{"text":"Once again, amazing.

We were here for dinner on NYE prior to going to the Bridge Bash at NYNY.  Although it was busy, we did not feel like they were rushing us to finish and open the table.  All the faves were ordered, as usual... Gorgonzola Mac, Lobster Mash, Filet, Mussels, Sweet Potato Fries, Chocolate Covered Strawberries.  Plus some other items our friends ordered.  Not a complaint to be heard from anyone at our table!  Drinks were great, and service was exceptional (as usual!).  

See you next time, Mastros!"}
{"text":"In a place where restaurant service is generally lacking (Las Vegas), Mastro's hits the ball out of the park!  This is top notch service (white & black napkin service, hot hand towel service between courses, sides served onto your dish at the table, crumbing, etc.).  Notables not to miss: the crab cocktail - TRUST ME.  OMG...already shelled WHOLE pieces of crab - and so many!!!  The cocktails are awesome - do not be scared by the $15-20 prices each, you get about 2.5 martini glasses full, since they leave the cocktail shaker with (a lot) more in there.  

We also had the escargot, which was a little (too) salty, even for this dish but still good and they made for a unique appetizer.  We had 3 different types of oysters, which were also good, but that is not really a refection on this restaurant since a raw oyster is a raw oyster...but they were very cold and served on a platter with dry ice, and accompanied by three different sauces, which was neat.  We shared the bone-in prime ribeye as an entree.  It was good, but Flemings is better, in our opinion.  Maybe we got a weird cut?  The dessert they brought out (complimentary) for my husband's birthday was the butter cake with ice cream.  It was excellent - my husband took that home and ate it in bed, like a heathen!  He even woke up and had some more the next day!!!  For a side, we had the lobster mashed potatoes... they were good and we are both glad we got them, but they were not worth $36, nor was there 1.5 pounds of lobster, as advertised.  That was a bit of a bummer, but we are still glad we got them once - still a tasty treat!  

Nothing was bad or even just OK - it was all good and points were extremely excellent - The real stand outs were the crab cocktail, the service, and the alcoholic cocktails - these were far and above other nice restaurants!  

We are so thrilled to have found this place (via a birthday gift for my husband from a friend) and are very much looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other yummy options on the menu!

Tips: ask to sit in the bird's nest.  You can share a steak and a few appetizers and have PLENTY.  we took our whole dessert and some of our steak home and we are both big eaters.  ORDER THE CRAB COCKTAIL!"}
{"text":"Omg. Warm butter cake = better than most anything I can think of, yes including THAT thing! One serving feeds 3-4 easily. The steak was perfect as was the salmon. The twice baked potato was very good. Service like no other. Even an oops was handled with grace and gentle self-deprecating humor that made it charming instead of annoying. I had heard \"it's in the middle of a mall\" which is technically true, but I found the atmosphere lovely and private, so I would disagree with that criticism. Worth every penny of the splurge."}
{"text":"We had our New Year's Eve dinner here. I requested a seat with a view inside the treehouse/nest and they complied! I was pleasantly surprised. Our server was great and attentive, and we had to stop ourselves from eating all the fresh bread. 
We weren't overly hungry so we shared a larger filet mignon. It was decent, but it wasn't as tender as others I've had before. The stone crab was delicious and I'd want to try their sea bass on a future visit. My bf has a sweet tooth, so we ordered sorbet for dessert. We got three of the largest scoops we've ever seen in our life! I joked for that size they should've given us one of each flavor instead of making us pick one. We only finished one scoop."}
{"text":"Mastro's is a food experience that you have to try at least once in your life. I went with a party of 3 and got a nice seat in the three house. The staff is super professional and make you feel like a good. They take care of your water, pick up any croutons, make sure your drink is filled up. 
Mastro's Ocean club specializes in seafood and their many offers every type of fished cooked different ways: Pan seared, grilled, and blackened. 
I personally have had the Chilean Sea Bass, and its magnificent. They give you a thick filet and they cook it just perfectly. 
Mastro's is also really good at steaks and I've had the filet mignon and is amazing!!! The sides are shareable and I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes. It's the most delicious mashed potatoes ever, with generous pieces of lobster. 
The clam chowder is nice and can be split between two people. 
For appetizer I tied the shrimp cocktail and OMG! The biggest shrimps ever! The cocktail sauce was a little bit to hot but delicious! 
As most of you have read the main thing about Mastro's is the Buttercream cake. A delicious dessert with pieces of fruit, ice cream and home made whipped cream. This cake can no be described with words you can just try it and enjoy it \"mmmmmmm\" feel the most amazing flavors in your mouth. 
I know my review is getting longer but I can't leave without mentioning my favorite cocktail. This guys have a cocktail name Hennessy Sidecard. It's made with Hennessy and juices, it's a strong and delicious drink. They bring you the shaker to the table. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely fantastic restaurant. Every part of our meal was great. However, the desert was the star of the show as it was by far the best dessert I have ever ordered. This restaurant deserves 10 stars."}
{"text":"So as we walk into this place I was very skeptical to think that they would produce good food because on the outside all you see if the tree house and you kind of don't understand how to get in here but then we walked in and it finally made sense.we were celebrating our cousins birthday so there was four of us.

So let's start with appetizers we had the crab cakes which here they were your typical crab cakes nothing special but still tasted petty good.

Bone marrow!! I'm telling you it's the business here! They were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.I would definitely order it again yummy!

So the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and I'm glad we ordered this steak. And for 88 bucks I expected another mediocre steak but boy was I wrong. I asked the waiter when the steak came out if I needed any sauces for this steak and I was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak I've had in my life so far..I was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a regular.my wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! Thank you so much for the experience

Our cousin and sister had the rack of lamb and for me I'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that I try it and I was amazed because normally when I eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.

As for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and I will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious

Since we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and I think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what I will come back for it was such a great meal."}
{"text":"I always passed by Mastro's but never had a chance to try their food. My BF and his brother took me here for my birthday last September. We order a couple a la carte sides ( Yumm to the lobster mash) and I ordered the rack of lamb. I really like my lamb but unfortunately it was too much for me to finish. I highly recommend this place if you've never been."}
{"text":"Probably one of the top 40 meals of my life, and I've eaten at some good places. The staff was attentive to every detail. The food was perfectly prepared."}
{"text":"Always excellent food.  We have only had seafood here, and each time its fantastic.  Must save room for butter cake dessert!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, and it never disappoints.  Service is very attentive, food is excellent.  Must have the butter cake for dessert."}
{"text":"Cool location inside a wooden sculpture... that is inside a high-end boutique mall.... in the middle of City Center.... on the Las Vegas Strip.... in the middle of the desert...  Should I continue? Anyway, the truffle gnocchi was tops in my book with shavings of truffle visible in the sauce. Our server was super friendly and we enjoyed the pretzel bread... Its VERY new trendy classy fancy Vegas."}
{"text":"I completely regret resisting going to this place. After 3 hard vegas days, expensive food seemed like a waste, but this meal was one of the best memories of the trip. Lobster Bisque was definitely one of or the best I've ever had, my friends' macaroni and cheese was huge and delicious and the butter cake, our main reason for going here was so good, I was contemplating pulling the trigger right there just to force in a few more bites. Sitting in the treehouse in the middle of the mall made the whole experience that much more unique. There was a 2:1 diner/waiter ratio, our main guy was one of the most attentive pros I've ever had."}
{"text":"My favorite steak house at the moment came to celebrate the Hubby's birthday dinner the service and food was excellent highly suggest it!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night as for my birthday celebration. The service was great but the food was terrible. Our dinner cost nearly $400 for two people and we were sick afterwards. We both had food poisoning. The food was lack of flavors and just filled with tons of butter.

It was our first time and last time to this restaurant. The thought of my birthday dinner last night still makes me nauseated."}
{"text":"I'd come back just for the bar and their complimentary various styles of bread"}
{"text":"Had the chocolate pudding. Loved it. So delicious. Definitely very rich. One portion enough for two. Environment and service were great too."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience with Mastro's! 
We came in with a large party for a Christmas dinner. This was most of my guests first time dining here. We had a view of the treehouse, love the architecture! There was no wait for a table. 
We started with Calamari, Smoked Salmon Caesar Salad and Chopped Salad. The bread basket was to die for! We enjoyed New York strip, Filet, Chicken, Artic Char, and my favorite the Sea Bass! We had so many sides, they were all wonderful! 
Our servers Trista and Daniel were wonderful. Very friendly, always made sure we had a drink and were happy. And the manager Luciana checked on us a few times making sure we were enjoying each course. 
Best dinner in Vegas ever! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Sixty minutes after our reservation we were seated.  N o other expensive restaurant I have ever been in ( NYC, Europe, San Fransisco) has ever treated us so shabbily.  fish portions are half the size they used to be with higher prices.  the waiters are actors trying to promote poor and expensive food with clever worrisome."}
{"text":"my favorite restaurant ever!
no happy hour here but man the food & drinks are unbelievable
desert ... you HAVE to order the warm butter cake. I mean all he deserts are amazing the the butter cake Takes the cake lol"}
{"text":"My boss told me about this top notch steak house in city center so I decided to check the place out. Since the price was preminium, I expected nothing less.  When I first arrived, I was greeted by the front, she showed me to my table.  while walking towards our table, i was greeted again by another waitress passing by us.  when i arrived at the table, the front service didn't even bother to pull the chair for me.  The restaurant had unique architecture design. I looked around our table and noticed there were a lot of ... gold diggers in the restaurant. Lol table next to me were party of two females, they were trying to hit on \"johnny depp\" look a like singer/musican at the restaurant.

I ordered bone-in ribeye, sweet potato fries, and calamari for appetite. Few minutes later, our waiter brought 4 different types of cold bread. Petzel, fried, chatula, and other bread I can't remember. I wished the bread was warm it would have been better.  Finally after waiting 10 minutes, our calamari came out.. damn it was salty.. I couldn't finish the calamari, it tasted straight out of ocean.. my steak came out sizzling on hot plate and sweet potato fries were in big basket enough to feed party of 4.  First bite of fries were... f&ck its salty..  now on to the steak... omg the chef has lost his tongue... its also super salty...  and outside was a little overcooked, it had the crispy burned taste.  well ..that's end of my story.. the food was soo salty, I gave up trying to finish $100 meal.. chef probably thought that i was exposed to japanese nuclear radiation and i needed extra iodine in my thyroid. the waiter couldn't keep up refilling my water.. i ended up drinking total of 4 cups of water. my worst preminium steak house experience."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review on only a single visit. That said, we had a pretty good experience at Mastro's: quick seating despite a relatively crowded restaurant and no reservations. The table ordered a mix of steak and fish dishes. Mine, the Sashimi-style Ahi tuna was fresh, well prepared and well cooked. Steaks came sizzling hot and sides, while maybe note quite as big as the waiter described, were excellent and big enough to share. The highlight was probably the butter cake desert: awful for you, I'm sure, but melt-in-your mouth delicious. Recommended."}
{"text":"I visited this Mastro's for a business dinner and it really was incredible. First, they were sensitive to our request for a quiet place where we could talk without raising our voices. 

As for the food, my steak (12oz filet Oscar style) was PERFECT and so were the caesar salad, asparagus, and scalloped potatoes. The wine list was extensive and the service was pretty consistent with other steakhouses but not as good as my recent visit to Fleming's. Bottom line - I would absolutely return to this Mastro's! 

Thanks for a GREAT meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner, wonderful service. Steaks were cooked to perfection. Lobster mash was unbelievable - with large pieces of meat, very tasty and enough to serve 4. My very \"particular\" husband gave it a 10 (that is a rareity). The warm butter cake is delightful and, again, enough to serve 4. Looking forward to the next occasion to celebrate at Mastro's OC!"}
{"text":"Stopped at Mastro's for our early Valentine's Day celebration and it was exceptional! Yes prices are a bit much, but for such high class food and service it's all well worth it! The Lobster Bisque soup was my favorite part. Our server Trista made our experience even better."}
{"text":"How can anyone not love this place?  

Amidst Yelp's Spring Break festivities and other dining excursions we had in Vegas, the dining experience at MOC was one of the most memorable.  
From the amazing \"eighth wonder of the world\" tree house we were sitting in, to a generous martini offering, to excellent overall service....it was beyond a five star experience. And I haven't even scratched the surface yet.   

With all the eating going on in Vegas, I could have been very content with just their fresh pretzel rolls and a fantastic Campagna Burrata salad.  
But I couldn't resist and...

...order more pretzel rolls.  They were just too addicting.
...try their Brussel Sprouts.  Lightly salted to perfection.
...taste the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  One order can feed an army.  
...sample their Petite Filet.  Medium rare truly melted in my mouth.
...and savor the Seared Sea Scallops.  Cooked just right with an orgasmic garlic butter sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q?select=krtNnXcIArthzdx-FQ1_RA#MwXtyVuKcCbgmgFiZySLuQ)

Just when I thought it was over, I was reminded of their infamous Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  So I had to be a teamplayer and try a little.  It was heavenly.  No matter how full we were, dinner was not complete without indulging in this popular dessert...and the accompanying gigantic bowl of whip cream. I discovered that 10 spoonfuls is \"just a little taste\" when it comes to this cake topped with vanilla ice cream and sliced strawberries. Ay! 

Their mysterious live piano artist kept us entertained and added a nice touch to the ambiance of not only the restaurant, but around all of Crystals mall. 
This will not be the last time I dine here, that's for sure. Even though we were running late to a Yelp event, it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location more times than I can remember.  I adore the gorgeous setting in Crystals, part of City Center in Vegas and  I love sitting at the opulent marble bar and enjoying a glass of wine.  The bartenders on this particular night were a little busy so we were not getting the service we usually would expect, but it was still good.  We ordered oysters for the appetizer.  As always, fresh and delicious!  The seafood here is consistently fresh and perfectly prepared. I have never had the steak, but people rave about that as well.  Mastros, you never let me down.  Next time I am home, I shall visit you."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for an unbelievable dinner. This place really stands out in terms of food service. You guys rock thank you! 

Had dinner at del friscos the night before and it sucked."}
{"text":"Pretty much everything positive has been said about this Mastro's location in Las Vegas. Sit in the \"Tree house\" if you can. It's a cool atmosphere.

Great service, excellent quality, and well-mixed drinks. 

Just be sure to try the brussel sprouts. Wow."}
{"text":"Finally tree Mastro's ocean club! I can't believe I waited this long to try it. What a great place and amazing food. From the drinks to appetizers to dinner and dessert.....everything was perfect! I started the night with their cosmo which has dry ice in it so it starts out smoky and cool looking. We had a seafood tower and iceberg wedge salad to start with. The seafood tower was amazing! Fresh seafood displayed perfectly on the platter. The wedge salad was good, but I will say I have had better.  For dinner I had filet with mash potatoes, Brussels sprouts and salt and vinegar fries!!! All of it was outstanding. Saving the best for last was the butter cake which was beyond any dessert I have ever had!!! Everything was great and I will be back very soon! The only drawback about everything was the charge for valet. I thought it was silly for this type of restaurant to charge for valet."}
{"text":"This is my current pick for the #1 best place for a business dinner in town (assuming cost is no object). There's a nice variety of steaks and seafood, and the ambiance is quiet and fantastic. It's not too trendy or loud, and the food is classic and well prepared. The tree house area is especially nice. 

We tried a bit of everything, and all of it was fantastic. The cold seafood tower appetizer was fantastic (the stone crab claws were the stand out!). For our entrees most of us got seafood and were all pleased! I loved my arctic char, although it was HUGE - stupid HUGE. Honestly it seemed like 16-20 ounces of freaking fish on my plate. With all the other yummy food floating around I could barely polish off a quarter of my fish. If I was dining with my husband, this is definitely a dish we could share. The best side with the crab and black truffle gnocchi... OMG.. best gnocchi of my life ! The lobster mashed potatoes were pretty incredible as well. 

So the butter cake did live up to the hype! Moist, rich, delicious. Four of us split this and felt like there was more than enough to go around. Even if you don't think you have room for dessert - this cake is good enough to warrant making yourself sick !

I can't say I tried any meat, but for seafood I really loved this place. Great service, and great food."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant with hungry stomach knowing that they are famous for their big portion food lol. So I was astonished with their lobster mash potatoes. Many of you might know lots of dishes with \"lobsters\" ain't really serving many lobsters in it (not even with \"Red Lobsters\"), but man, this dish came with A LOT OF lobsters in it, which made me speechless with the tenderness and the flavor of the sauce! It totally worth $38. And also you can see the size of the Bone-in ribeye (22 oz.) which I took more than half home cause I was hungry but not that hungry haha! We had a great experience with the service as well, the GM on training came to say hi with friendly introduce. We will be back fo sho! :)"}
{"text":"We went there for a birthday party.  Lemon drop Martini to die for , 12 oz bone in filet was great 
Brandon was very professional and great service he gave us is going to be remember for long time"}
{"text":"A phenomenal, 3 hour experience of a meal for our party of 7. For drink, I had the signature Manhattan, which is one of the best made ones I've had. The serving size was very generous, and came with the shaker on the table for a \"refill.\"  I had the onion and beefsteak tomato salad, which was quite good, and very simple. The bone in Ribeye was to die for: crusty top, meltingly tender interior, and huge. The roasted Brussels sprouts were my favorite side, but the lobster mashed potatoes were memorable. For dessert we split the chocolate cake, pecan pie, and butter cake. By far, the star of the show was the butter cake-i will be thinking about that dessert for a long time!  Service was friendly, at tentative, and very informative."}
{"text":"This Mastro's is better than the one in LA. All 3 of us couldn't believe how good it was. The sauteed mushrooms are out of this world. 

I had the 12oz filet (not the on the bone filet) and it was amazing. I don't like bone-on filets personally. I know i'm the only one. It was great. 

Its in the mall at the aria/crystals/whatever the fuck its called place, but its a pretty upscale mall with lots of swanky shit goin on - so don't stress, its not mall food-ish at all."}
{"text":"It's our special event place when we're in Las Vegas, and tonight was a special, special event. The food was wonderful, and so was our server, Katie. We snagged a table in the bar corner, ordered copious amounts of chilled seafood and great cocktails and Katie and the team brought it all to us was great attitude and special service. Any question I asked (and I asked a ton) was welcomed. Thanks to Katie and the gang for making it a great night."}
{"text":"Fav steakhouse chain. Lobster mash a must. Any steak with bone-in a must. Top notch service. Located inside mall. Less stuffy then other locations."}
{"text":"Great bar with full food menu, jazz nightly and the filet was great!  Nice when by yourself or don't want/need the full dining experience. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience, food, flare, and fun. If you've never been to a Mastro's, you need to try it at least one time. Save it for a special occasion, big promotion at work, or any other time you either (1) want to treat yourself or (2) want to show off to someone else. 

Regardless of which Mastro's you visit, come prepared to spend a few bucks. It's well worth it for the food and normal for a high end steakhouse, but for those unfamiliar with the brand, I didn't want you to be caught off guard. Rough prices: Drinks $20, Appetizers $25, Salads $20, and Steaks $50. They do have items cheaper than what I've highlighted, but also have specials that are much higher. For example, my steak was $144. For my wife and I, dinner was about $350 plus tip (I had a few drinks). 

Ladies, be sure to order the Lemondrop. It's not on the menu, but will be made upon request. It's a sweet vodka based drink with chunks of dry ice at the bottom. When served, the drink literally steams over. Attention getting and for the lady in your life, something special. 

Lastly, there are a lot of steakhouses in Vegas. If you're reading this, your probably doing what I did. Poking around yelp to compare and see which one was right for me. We ultimately picked Mastro's because they are a chain - and they can't afford to taint their reputation (they are generally in extremely wealthy areas). I've been to several steakhouses in Vegas, and this one seems the most consistent. 

Good luck and enjoy!

PS - this is in the Crystals Mall, adjacent to the Aria. It's inside of that wooden treehouse that goes up to the ceiling."}
{"text":"Big freaking place! 

Great happy hour crowd with top shelf drinks -- even better if you stay for dinner -- some of the best seafood I have ever tasted... though it will set you back more than a few bucks.

The decor is upscale -- though most people are dressed casual.

We had a reservation and still had to wait 20min."}
{"text":"In town for a convention and went to dinner with a group of 18.  Sat in a private section, had incredible service and an amazing meal from the drinks, apps, to the main course.  Plus the live music was right on with our group.  Great time!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service! I had the swordfish and it was very good.

I found it funny that the waiter kept on looking to my grandpa to pay the bill ect. When i was paying.   *NOTE to Mastro's*  Don't under estimate a 25 year old.  Perhaps Place the check in the Middle?  Never just assume."}
{"text":"Food and service is impeccable! My fiancé and I went and can't wait to go back! I had the filet and he had the bone-in ribeye, both we great! Their twice backed potato was too good to just consider it a potato and the king crab claw on ice was delicious! We go to steak houses often everywhere we travel but this is definitely in the top for us."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for an early valentine's dinner.  Reservations were at 7:30 pm and we were seated immediately. We were seated in the half booth half tables that are right next to the bar. You know, the ones that are right on top of each other. I was annoyed, because I would think they would save these seats for walk-ins. I was determined to not let that upset me and I'm so happy I didn't. Our waiter was awesome as was our food. They bring this beautiful bread basket with a variety of wonderful fresh bread, served with butter of course. 
We started with the colossal Dungeness crab which came out with dry ice so it was smoking. It was pretty neat. The crab was very fresh.  I drank water, but my ordered a double shot crown and coke. There was so much crown when the waiter brought the drink that he couldn't put but a splash of coke in it (sodas come in little aluminum bottles). I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband ordered the 12oz filet. We shared the garlic mashed potatoes and mushrooms. My sea bass was cooked to perfection and it was huge, I couldn't even finish it.  My husband's filet was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.  The mashed potatoes had a soft garlic flavor. They were my husband's favorite. The mushrooms were sautéed with rosemary. I've never had mushrooms with rosemary. It was a new flavor for me and I liked it. Our waiter brought us the butter cake for dessert complimentary for dining with them. This was my favorite. It came with a ginormous side of homemade whipped cream. It was the greatest, most delicious thing I've had. I've been dreaming about it ever since! I love this restaurant and have told all my friends and family about it. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Ambience is awesome. Food is delicious. The sea bass, crab cakes, cream corn, desserts are all great! The staff is quick and attentive."}
{"text":"I am here during the restaurant week. Crab cake is fantastic! 16oz New York Strip is huge and tender."}
{"text":"AMAZING as always :)
Came for my Daddy's 60th birthday dinner while in Vegas for the weekend. Mastro's never fails to disappoint. Table for 6 in the treehouse, in the round white booths. Service was excellent like usual. The only thing was that they messed up on the peppercorn on my fiance new york strip. I know it's the ocean club but all the Mastro's are usually consistent. Can't take away a star for that b/c everything else was amazing. The server even brought complimentary THREE DESSERTs for the table for my dad's birthday. Usually they bring the slice of chocolate cake or the butter cake, but they presented a massive plate with those two and eclairs! AMAZING but prob a good 5000 calories. 
Love Mastro's and will def be back to this location next time we're in Vegas. 
Thanks for making my father's dinner a memorable one!"}
{"text":"I had the privilege to dine here with my company earlier this year during our annual sales conference. As such, everything was planned out to the nines before our arrival. Since it was held at Kierland Resort, we just had to cross the street and *boom!* we were there.

Plenty of staff were on hand with champagne and wine for us all for a little social hour before being formally seated for dinner. It was a family style dinner with a waiter to serve every part of the meal to us each.  We had a selection of soup or salad for our appetizer and the meat for our main course and the dessert selection. TBH There was no bad selection on the menu. Most memorable? My wedge salad, the calamari, the mashed potatoes, and key lime pie. My one suggestion would be to keep the lighting up and not so dim in the evening."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this location - I've gone to the Malibu and Beverly Hills locations before and wanted to try the one in Vegas for my husbands birthday. It pains me to say that the food unfortunately was not good this time. Upon arrival, they seated us pretty promptly, in around 5 minutes or so. By the time the waiter came by, 20 minutes had passed - I get it, a restaurant gets busy, so I didn't think much of it. We ordered the entire meal at once -  crab, iceberg wedge, and the Ahi tuna tartare as our appetizers - these were the best part of our meal. Our main dishes took an hour to come out and the waiter didn't come by to check on us, etc. My husband ordered the bone-in ribeye and I ordered the filet. Both steaks were to be cooked medium, but they were cooked well and seasoned so heavily with pepper and salt that I could barely taste the meat. It made the meat so dry. We also ordered green beans, mashed potatoes and mushrooms for the sides...the green beans lacked flavor; they tasted like nothing. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were okay.

In any case, I was disappointed at this place - some things were good, but others were subpar, given it is Mastro's."}
{"text":"Fantastic Seafood tower and wine list - good music when I was there and a lot of great people"}
{"text":"Always great food! Very good service & dessert is yummy worth the price, big portions great value and quality food!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try a fancy steakhouse on our trip to vegas and Mastro's did not disappoint.  the rodeo was in town that weekend and we saw lots of happy looking cowboy types (i assume they know good beef). 

i had the smallest filet and it was perfectly cooked! the meat was delicious. the rub on the outside i felt was the tiniest bit too salty but i can live with that. 

the mac n cheese was so rich. i got the half sized portion but ended up taking half of it home. it was still delicious days later.

we also had a healthy side of broccoli was steamed nicely. can't complain about that. 

the one thing that did sort of bother me was that the cokes were served in tiny 8 oz bottles. at 4 bucks a pop the refills can add up. if i had known this i would have gotten an iced tea instead. so i'll dock a star for that.

this place is pricey and i'd return but only if i was ok with spending special occasion amounts of money."}
{"text":"First of all the calamari was as good as the stuff we get in Mexico and the butter cake was amazing. BUT, the ambiance wasn't that great. Too much crammed into one space in the middle of, what feels like, a mall. I wouldn't pay the prices again for the food quality. It was good and had good flavor and service was good. But it was not anything amazing. We had the crab legs, the KC ribeye, creamed spinach, and scalloped potatoes. It was good food, like I said, but I would never pay the high prices for it again."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club is one of my favorite restaurants inside of City Center!  Although the designer of this restaurant claims that it is set in a treehouse, it feels more like the dining room of a luxury cruise ship.  

Their Caesar salad CANNOT be beat.  I'm a huge fan of the pretzel bread too and apparently my server noticed.  He won my heart by giving me an entire basket of it!

I wish they were still open for lunch."}
{"text":"Mastro's is amazing. I had the best steak here (even though this restaurant heavily features seafood). We had an early reservation because we had an 8:30 show to go to. We were seated immediately and i think they gave us white or black napkins, which they placed across our laps for us, based on what color we were wearing. And that was just a hint of the level of service to come. We had a very attentive server, but someone in a suit, his supervisor (?) was also constantly checking on us. My water glass was never empty, a standard I use to base a restaurant's level of service. I had gotten up once to use the restroom and accidentally dropped my napkin. As I was leaning over to pick it up, our server appeared out of nowhere and immediately insisted that he would do it. When i came back a fresh napkin was folded at my seat. When the sides came, someone immediately offered to serve them to us. I was surprised no one offered to cut my steak...lol. The restaurant quickly filled up, but from the time that we were seated until we left, never once did the superb service lapse.

Ok onto the food: There were a few different types of bread and i think I like most of them. They refilled our bread basket, but I wish they didn't lol because I ate way too much bread. I ordered a berry flavored cocktail and it came in a martini glass, but they also set down a shaker cup by my glass, and to my delight, there was enough to fill my glass a second time! =D We ordered the steamed mussels appetizer and they were delicious, so fresh, not fishy at all. Just delicious. I could have inhaled an entire order myself. Everyone ordered the ribeye and it was perfect. So, so good. We were trying to be kinda healthy so we got sauteed mushrooms and spinach and creamed corn as sides. But afterwards I wish we had gotten the mac & cheese and the truffle gnocchi. Everything was so delicious and the portions were pretty big. I ate about a third of my ribeye and we didn't even finish all of the sides. Luckily our hotel room had a fridge so we could take the leftovers. 

It was definitely pricey, but for the amazing service and food, I think it was well worth it. I would definitely go back or at least go to one of the SoCal locations. Mastro's is the standard by which I compare all steakhouses and other fine dining establishments to."}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience....

Booked President's Day weekend in Scottsdale as we did last year. Decided to try Maestro's Ocean Club here as we have one in Newport Beach so good to compare. We also frequent Maestro's in Costa Mesa.

The start was great- our friendly server Duke was attentive, we received out drinks but my lemon drop martini was mediocre at best so ended up leaving it. Ordered Brunello and started with our favorite Dungeness Crab appetizer. To be followed w/Caesar dressing and then the wait started. We waited, waited and waited some more. When I asked after 45 minutes where is our dinner we were told it was \"rushed\" and would be delivered soon. Only for folks who came after us at the next table to receive their dinner.

Finally the food came- the grouper was dry and overcooked and the chef's cut NY Strip- burned to char on the outside and uncooked on the inside....so after 2.5 hrs we ended up with baked potato and steamed spinach for dinner at $300.

No manager ever showed up or an explanation was offered. I am sorry but this is unacceptable in a steakhouse of this caliber. I don't mind paying the price for the quality- but the quality of food and service is expected and should be delivered."}
{"text":"Poor service and loud, hectic atmosphere characterize this restaurant, not good food.  Eating here is painful. One would expect that the abundance of servers, waiters, busboys, etc running around make an efficient system, but the reason for them being there is to get you out of the restaurant as fast as possible after spending your money. It is seriously overstaffed with perdons who just want to chat among themselves. Mastros Ocean Club offers poor value and a painful experience under the desguise of fine dining. The lobster bisque is good but it will fill you up. The greasy lobster potatoes are a waste. Try a sime potato instead. The fish? Dry, blah, no taste. There is no way that it is fresh. This was not our first time at Mastros OC and this review is based on my impressions at every visit."}
{"text":"My boyfriends company decided to host a corporate get together at Ocean Club...  It was by far one of the most amazing restaurants I've been to!  The service was impeccable, the food was perfectly prepared, and the ambiance was lively!!  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!!"}
{"text":"The lobster mash-potatoes are worth the calories. I brought in 25 with dinner at this location, I loved the free dessert for special occasions, I loved the feeling of floating in the sky great view was kind of hard to find the location but we made it, most definitely a must try over and over again"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner again in the bar . Great atmosphere , football games on and music at perfect level for conversation . Drinks, food , and service were outstanding . Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"This place is a little expensive, but worth it.  Nice ambience with live music.  I enjoyed the scallops - locals recommend this place for seafood - and the asparagus.  They are the best scallops I have ever eaten!  The service is also great with attractive waitresses as a bonus ;-)"}
{"text":"Uno de los mejores lugares para cenar de Scottsdale, definitivamente la \"fuente de mariscos\", los cortes y sobre todo no debes de dejar de probar el butter cake."}
{"text":"We've had Mike as our waiter at least a dozen times and yet every time we have him I find myself in quiet awe. I forget to request his section but luckily we seem to end up there. My wife and I have friends that visit us annually and he remembered my friends order from one year ago and the specificity of his order. He mentioned something that had happened the year prior. We had never had this discussion with him prior. Mike is simply the best waiter I have ever had anywhere. If you catch the subtle things he does you will be impressed as well. The food is always good here, this place isn't my favorite as far as the food. That's not to say I don't enjoy it. I definitely do. The bartenders do an adequate job for sure. If you go ask for Mike as your waiter. I don't know his last name but he is the gentleman with the beard and the deep voice. Thank you Mike, you make the Ocean Club better than it might be otherwise."}
{"text":"Drinks: Lemon Drop, Mastro's Mojito, Basil Mary
Appetizer: Chilled Alaskan King Crab Legs
Entrées: Bone-In 12oz Filet, Chilean Sea Bass
Sides: Lobster Mashed Potatoes, Sautéed Spinach
Dessert: Warm Butter Cake

Everything here was top-notch. Service was attentive, food was perfect. The quality pairs appropriately with the price.

The crab legs come with three sauces: horseradish, cocktail, and a third that I've forgotten (we preferred the others). The mashed potatoes have a generous helping of lobster and the flavors are pronounced. The sea bass is larger than you'd ever expect; I actually took half home! 

We were much too full for dessert, but we still ordered it to go! Mastro's packed a lovely box for us."}
{"text":"We've been to the maestros in Newport beach and Beverly hills a few times each. They are both better than the one next to aria that we ate at tonight. The bread was delicious, the crab appetizer was also fantastic. We got the escargot and it was actually terrible. It wasn't hot and the snails didn't taste good at all. I was very disappointed, because usually its one of my favorite things to order at other fine dining restaurants. My husband ordered lamb chops and they were very good. I got the prawn special. Each prawn was 8oz. Don't order this dish. Prawns aren't suppose to be that big. They tasted like bottom feeders. 

Our friends got the filet and the tuna, both were very good. 

Service was good.  Dessert was good. They brought us the butter cake for our anniversary. It was delicious. 

Overall it was good and management was great!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday this year. The best part was my friends picked up the tab:) The food was fantastic. When I found out from a friend who works here that the same chef who created the city hall menu is the executive chef at ocean club I knew getting a steak to compliment my fish was the right choice. The only down side was that everyone who went out that night were so full that we decided that it was a better idea to go home ad sleep than hit the clubs.....well maybe that wasn't a bad thing after all."}
{"text":"Mastro's takes the cake as far as a next-level steak and seafood experiences and has set the bar very high for all other like-contenders. Their Bone-In Ribeye (charred, medium-rare plus) will forever be the compared-to factor against all other steaks I come across in my lifetime. 
The Ocean Club was an excellent dining experience among many in the city of Las Vegas. The great ambiance of the tree house accompanied by stellar five-star service sets a standard of elevated heights and their menu features some of the best food items in town. 
Without saying anything more, I have zero complaints on my first encounter and eagerly looking forward to my next."}
{"text":"This restaurant is about as first class as it gets.  The food and service were just spectacular and the ambiance quite romantic.  It's a very good place for a nice dinner for two with your spouse more than anything, although I saw all kinds of people there. The menu is a bit pricey and everything is a la carte, so be prepared for a big check.  I loved the whiskey menu, quite extensive."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday evening for a pharmaceutical lecture. We got escorted to the 2nd floor where we had our own private room. I had the grilled salmon and grilled chicken with mash potatoes, spinach, and sweet snap peas, cheesecake with fruit on the side and coffee and of course some some chardonnay to wash it all down. 

- Great service! Can't complain when you have 5 waiters giving you food all at the same time and always refilling my wine glass...hiccup! lol
- Salmon was very flaky! crispy on the outside and soft body texture inside. And I can say that for the chicken as well! It was delicious. Rich seasoning!
- The sides could have been better, but I didn't think it taste like PRISON FOOD! haha. That's a bit harsh. 
- The cheesecake was superb! So smooth and creamy. I highly recommend a slice!
- The men's bathroom looks like a women's bathroom! You have your own room. 
- Can't speak for a dinner for 2 at this location, but great venue for a formal event."}
{"text":"This place is always up to par. Great service and the food is perfect!! The seafood tower is so fresh and the steaks are cooked to perfection. The sides are all so good it's hard to choose. And the butter cake for desert is to die for!!!!! Always come back here"}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  Outstanding service and excellent.  My only gripe is that it is sooooooo expensive.  Otherwise it's 5-star all the way.  Perhaps you get what you pay for?"}
{"text":"To summarize the menu: lobster mashed potatoes and warm butter cake. Whatever else you get doesn't really matter."}
{"text":"It is no secret that I am a huge carnivore. Naturally I constantly get asked what the best steak is. However, one does not simply choose a best steak. True aficionados do not limit themselves to one choice. They are so in love with the subject they want to learn everything about it. So when you ask me for my favorite steak be prepared for a long response. I might ask you what you've liked in the past and what you look for in a steak. There are so many ways to prepare a steak that it can't be drilled down to just one ideal steak. 

With that said, Mastro's did not disappoint. It has made it on to my list of high quality eats.

Went on a Saturday night so it was very busy. However the service kept up with the demand quite well. There is a bar with live piano music where you can wait while they prepare your table.

We ordered the seafood tower with oysters and shrimp. Other available choices were lobster, caviar and crab legs. No complaints here. Just great tasting, fresh food.

I wasn't in the mood to have the meat sweats later so I ordered the modestly sized bone-in filet, medium rare. I judge a steak by how it's cooked more than anything else. I like mine almost rare and it was cooked as requested. Highly recommended. Other steaks at my table were the Tomahawk Wagyu Ribeye and the Ribeye. The steaks are huge so plan accordingly if you want to order sides and dessert, and you should.

As for side dishes we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The mashed potatoes had a whole lobster mixed in it and topped with a sauce flavored with the juices from the lobster. Most creamed spinach I've tried in the past were way too buttery but they nailed it here. More cream than butter so it remained thick and didn't fall apart.

The service was first rate as expected for a joint like this. Our waiter, Craig, was professional and gave us a great tip when we asked if he knew a place to get cigars afterwards. 

To top it off the hostess sent us a butter cake on the housel! I normally don't order dessert but this cake changed my life."}
{"text":"This was an outstanding dining experience!   Being from New Orleans we are true connoisseurs of the perfect dining experience.  Always in in search of The Best!  Mastros/ Scottsdale exceeded our expectations!!  The Blackened Chilean Sea Bass was the absolute best I've ever had!   Great bar experience, live music while waiting for our reservation.  Nick was the true professional waiter.  Smart, informed, helpful, social and non-intrusive. #5star"}
{"text":"This establishment immediately transported my husband and I back to a place and time when class, couth, tact and phenomenal service reigned as common; not the exception!  My husband and I were enthusiastically greeted by several beautiful hostesses as we walked in.  We opted to sit at the bar where we were once again made welcome by Alexis and George, our bartenders for the evening.  We each ordered a martini which was made to perfection.  Shaken vigorously and served in a chilled glass with the extra contents left on the bar in an ice cold mixing steel for us to pour when we we ready.   Behind us was a small band that played great classics and tunes that many of the guests were dancing to on the \"17 square foot\" dance floor.  LOL!   Josh and Brie were a lot of fun and very good entertainers.  

We ordered escargot, calamari w/ a unique dipping sauce and roasted bone marrow appetizers.  These were served to us by a very pleasant and professional bar back, Cesar. These dishes proved to be expertly prepared, served piping hot and very tasty.   My husband struck up a conversation with a lovely young lady next to him, Ann. To his delight she was a fellow east coaster and he was thrilled to hear a familiar accent.  Ann was very nice as was typical of every person we met here and as it turned out she was related to the General Manager, Phil.  Phil stopped by and took the time to introduce himself and speak to us like we were old friends.  

I cannot give enough accolades to describe our time at the Ocean Club.  If you are in the Scottsdale area and want to have a fun and unique dining experience. This is the place!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. My husband and I went to Mastro's Ocean Club while visiting Scottsdale on a business trip based on the reviews on Yelp. It was wonderful!!!  The bar scene was amazing, the live music which was heard from outside was the greatest music. The appetizers and drinks came to our table sizzling, wow!!  I was impressed.  The shrimp cocktail and martini were fabulous.  Our waiter, I believe his name was Brandon, was the greatest.  Very sweet, thoughtful, made suggestions, not pushy.. great guy.  The steak wasnt fabulous, probably my fault though, i ordered it medium well, so a little overcooked, but the crab legs were to die for.  The bread and butter brought out before dinner were warm and fresh.  We are from Los Angeles, but have never been to the Mastro's in Beverly Hills.  Actually, I had never even heard of it til I read the reviews on Yelp.  The staff, hostess, waiters, etc. were all outstanding, even the lady in the bathroom handing out towels was a pleasure, thank you for having her there.  I will definitely come back to Mastros Ocean Club, actually i want to move to Scottsdale once the kids go to college."}
{"text":"Ate here recently when we were in Vegas.  I was so excited because reviews were great.  Service was very good, food was very good.  Filets were good, but I guess I expected outstanding.  And of course, it's in a mall.  I would recommend someone try this place, but I'll try something else next time."}
{"text":"Loved the live lounge music, the extensive bar menu and of course the food. At first I thought the location was awkward until I sat down.  The lounge act was a sexy male/female duo who played the piano and had a swanky voice. (Most are not this pleasing to the eye.) The appetizers we tasted were incredible, especially the calamari and grilled asparagus. I loved the flair our bartender used and hope he did not mind our flaky decision making skills. Can not wait to go back for a full meal."}
{"text":"Obviously, this is a steakhouse, so it goes without saying that this place isn't built for vegetarians.  However, I enjoyed what I had - broccoli, green beans, and some mac and cheese.  The service was excellent, as was the wine, the bread provided, and the birthday cake they made for my boyfriend.  The look of the place is the coolest part, though, especially from the outside looking in.  It's located inside a mall, and words can't quite describe the architecture of the structure the restaurant is in, but it's neat and adds to the experience."}
{"text":"I've never ever thought in my life that I would find a perfect restaurant, but I guess I was proved wrong when I dined at Mastro's. The service was absolutely amazing; the waiters practically catered to our every whim and made sure that our time at Mastro's was warm and inviting. The appetizers were delicious. The escargot was average but the steamed mussels were very good. 

I ordered the petite fillet cooked to medium. My parents ordered their special of the night: the Australian wagyu. Let me just say the steaks were absolutely amazing. Definitely 5 star status; both of the steaks were flavorful and tender. The juices from the meat blended incredibly well with the spices. These were probably some of the best steaks I've eaten and I've eaten at a ton of places. 

The lobster mashed potatoes and the Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi was just so delicious and filled with epic flavors, I give my kindest remarks to the chef. The meal was too amazing. 

We were too stuffed for any dessert but the next time, I'll be sure to try something off of their dessert menu. This restaurant was way above expectation: service was extraordinary, food was delicious, amazing presentation and ambiance. Absolutely perfect! I love Mastro's and will be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"Same cuts of meat as the steakhouse. Rib eye is to die for! Scallops are on crack! Twin lobster tails are sweet and firm. Seafood tower appetizer can get a little pricey depending on what you order. $400 dinner excluding alcohol, worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Loved the dungeness crab appetizer, crab and truffle gnocchi, and lobster mashed potatoes. The steaks were good but not better than other high end steakhouses but the sides and appetizers were amazing."}
{"text":"First of all I don't want to slam this place. Service excellent, great menu, typical steakhouse atmosphere with a little kick (bar had live music which bought some life to the place)... but there's my problem. If I'm going to a high end (dinner $260 with tip) steakhouse I want it to feel like a high end steakhouse not TGIFriday's on Saturday night. Again, not bad. Not the best steakhouse I've been to, and not even in the top 5."}
{"text":"Made reservations for dinner the day before.  They even called me in the afternoon to confirm the reservation.  We show up on time and the table isn't ready.  OK, how long of a wait? I ask the hostest.  \"Well, I could tell you 40 minutes but it could be an hour\".  What?  I make the reservation, confirm it and I still have an hour wait?  \"No thanks\" and we walked out.

The place was packed, the crowd and music loud, and this is on a Wednesday.  I can't imagine what it's like on a Friday night or weekend.  Don't plan on going back, even if they started honoring reservations."}
{"text":"Great service. We were sat quickly with no reservation. Got seated with water service and bread expeditiously. And our server even ran to the bartender to cancel our drink order after he realized we were going to dine with a Morton's Giftcard, which obviously, Mastro's does not accept. Oooops. Our bad. 

Our cool server didn't make us feel any more stupid than we already did for being in the wrong restaurant. He even walked us half way towards the right one. If he's an example of the service at Mastro's, we may just come back."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here last night . I sat in the bar area with a buddy. I highly recommend the bar . It's casual but still has the level of service you expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Angie our server and provided us with the best service. Thanks Angie!
When I come back to  Vegas I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best in class service, experienced staff, outstanding steak and seafood, large portions. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I do really enjoy the food here.  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I want to have a very nice meal with conversation and great food, atmosphere, I would want a more quiet, fine dining restaurant. When OC is busy, it's loud, even when you're in the back section...I guess that's just not my cup of tea for a formal dinner.  

That said, if you want fun people/cougar watching and throw back a few glasses of wine or cocktails, sit in the bar area and have a great meal, with almost as good service as any other table.  

Their shrimp cocktail-LOVE LOVE! best mix your own cocktail sauce with a huge portion of fresh horseradish to make it hot like I love!  If you are splitting this make sure you request to add one more shrimp, since it only comes with 3. It comes extravagantly with dry ice spewing out underneath it. Very nice presentation.  Salads are huge and just so-so.  Ruth's Chris has better crab cakes, oysters rockefeller-just okay...Bread bowl is yummy, assorted warm breads of all sorts!

The great part:

Chilean Sea Bass Oreganata style (lightly seasoned bread crumbs soaked and crisped in BUTTER)  This is a large portion and I always end up splitting it. If you really want to splurge, they have the absolute best lobster mashed potatoes!  The lobster is layered out on top, not mixed in, as to not make the potatoes fishy tasting.  It's a huge portion with a good amount of lobster and  topped with more butter! Potatoes are super creamy but not overly whipped up, they have some texture to them. It is definitely a decadent dish and can potentially be a very heavy meal for 2. The creamed spinach is killer too!

One of my all time favorite desserts is their BUTTER CAKE...{Is this becoming a theme here? }  It is slightly sweet, slightly crispy on the outside, 'light' and fluffy on the inside, comes warm with fresh fruit and a giant bowl a fresh whipped cream.  It is to die for!"}
{"text":"Start to finish, these folks just get it right.  Came with high expectations and they were met at every turn."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! We had oysters Rockefeller and bone marrow for appetizer. Both were superb! Ribeye and rack of lamb for main course were absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was very inviting. The only draw back was the location in the mall. Will come back here every time  were in Vegas."}
{"text":"Sure you pay for it, but this is the real deal. The food is always fresh and perfectly prepared. The staff is trained to serve with knowledge and respect. It's no mystery why they've been in business so long and are expanding. Perfect for special occasions."}
{"text":"Terribly snooty staff.  We made reservations several days in advance only to be set way in back away from the music when there were open tables available. We asked to be set closer to the band and were told we had to wait 45 minutes.   Steaks were overcooked.  Bad attitude from the whole wait staff.  Not worth the price. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Great decor & design 
Good Food 
Good service 
Reservations a must 

Dropped in after a short search with my Yelp Android App, the design of the place by KAA is amazing. I felt like I was eating inside of a piece of art, sculpture that is. 

It's obvious the rich and famous dine here as the presentation of the entrees are really dramatic but very entertaining. Service was good, but could have been better - it was a Monday night. 

If you haven't been, you must give a try!"}
{"text":"Great place for a late steak dinner with no reservations usually.
The best meat and chefs plus service is top notch professional."}
{"text":"Well, since we were in LV we visited our usual place for a Sat night dinner. Glad we did as it is always top notch.

The Con's:
* The bathrooms are up stairs. A real bummer when your all cocktailed up and have to navigate carpeted stairs. There is an elevator, but you kind of feel odd waiting for an elevator to go up one floor.

The Pro's:

* Staff is always top notch, from the hostess, to the bus guys, all are great and seem to have been trained very well. Anyone can help you with anything. Never do you hear \"I will tell your waiter\". They just get things done and do it well.

* Food I always top notch. Never had a better steak on the strip. 

* Great vibe and crowd. Upscale and nice looking crowd. No torn jeans and camo here. It's nice seeing folks get cleaned up and dressed for dinner.

I will keep this review short as I have already reviewed them several times and don't want to repeat comments. If you have not tried this place, you should. Top notch for sure."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food great atmosphere and amazing service. Everything was prepared perfectly and was piping hot. The Chilean Sea bass was light and buttery while the twice baked potato was so savory my mouth is still watering two days later. Wine list was sophisticated and the lobster roll is a must get. Would recommend for anyone who has $100 a person to spend on dinner."}
{"text":"Everything cooked to perfection and delicious. The service and ambiance is unparalleled. This place is expensive but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I guess I had ridiculously high expectations because I love, love, loved Mastro's Steakhouse and a like seafood even more... I thought it would be the perfect combo, but I ended up kind of disappointed in Ocean Club. Maybe I ordered wrong, but my dish (and my date's) were far from outstanding; no great flavors or anything exciting at all about our food. 

The people watching in the bar area was great! I think the man to woman ratio was about 10:1. A perfect place to go if you're a single woman looking for a Tommy Bahama shirt wearing older North Scottsdale man who hangs around expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"A great experience from beginning to end. Excellent customer service, fantastic food, great wine and exceptional company! Highly recommend Mastro's.

Biggest highlight was the rack of lamb, extraordinary!"}
{"text":"By far the best restaurants in vegas, I have no words to describe this place was amazing the service was fantastic the waiters are nothing but perfection and professionalism the food is excellent I will definitely go back over and over again little expensive but every penny worth."}
{"text":"Best tasting food ever!! The shrimp cocktail are gigantic and delicious! The Caesar salad is very good. The clam chowder is amazing... But the only complaint I have is that either the waiters or the kitchen staff make a lot of mistakes with the steaks... It's either kinda undercooked or overcooked. I asked for a medium rare plus and they gave me a rare. They comped the steak because it was their error but it was just a shame I couldn't enjoy my steak. The butter cake there is amazing!! It's a must try for all!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! The bread basket was warm and fresh out of the oven. I'm not a huge steak person so I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. It was cooked perfectly. I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries. The mac & cheese was good and the lobster mashed potato was amazing!!! Not only was the food good but the location and being in a treehouse was fun. Service was top notch and I'll definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"I've been to the Mastro's in Costa Mesa several times so I was pretty excited to try this Mastro's. Plus, I've always wanted to dine in the treehouse that they have here! I suggest making a reservation and requesting the treehouse. I guess it's not anything too special, but it is nice being in a different setting that you can't really get anywhere else on the strip. 

The service here was excellent. Janene was our server and provided excellent customer service. She constantly checked up on us, refilling our wines and making sure our meals were to perfection. 

// FOOD & WINE //
Wine- The Prisoner: This wine is a blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Charbono. This wine had so many flavor profiles going on. It also went really well with all of the meat that we ordered. The wine was very smooth with plenty of fruity flavors to it. 

Sauteed spinach: Your basic sautéed spinach with garlic. I would rather suggest ordering the sautéed mushrooms.

Scalloped potatoes: It was good, but it wasn't excellent. I would have liked more cheese added to my scalloped potatoes. Also, the potatoes seemed to be slightly undercooked and hard. 

Bone-in ribeye: A great piece of meat with excellent meat to fat ratio and amazing flavor. I would definitely order this again. 

18 oz bone-in filet mignon: Ordered rare plus, this meat was so tender. Unfortunately it wasn't seasoned that well so I had to add salt and pepper to each bite. 

Overall, I enjoyed dining at this Mastro's location, but if I had to choose between this location and the location in Costa Mesa, I would have to choose the Costa Mesa location. The service at both locations were excellent, but I would have to say that I slightly enjoyed the food more at the Costa Mesa location."}
{"text":"One of the many indulgences of La Vegas. Mastro's is a well known stop for those looking to treat themselves. 
Food: We went as a group of 7 girls and all got steak with a variety of shared sides. I split a 16oz filet made medium (almost half the price it would cost to get an 8 oz filet on your own). It was everything I expected from a good steakhouse, well seasoned, tender, and perfectly cooked. Its only dressing was a melting slice of butter on the top. The sides were all generally well made. The lobster mashed potatoes had real chunks of lobster it in, though, between the 7 of us, not everyone got a piece. The brussel sprouts and asparagus were cooked to just the right texture but there was nothing really special about them. The creamed corn was sweet and luxuriously smooth but needed a little more savory to balance it out. 
Service: The service was excellent. The server was very accommodating and attentive. A few of us ordered steaks to split and they plated them separately for us. We also brought in our own cake since we were celebrating a birthday. They served the caked and repacked the leftover cake for us to go. 
Locations: Mastro's unique architecture has made it a near icon among the casinos on the strip. Floating in the middle of Crystals, it makes up a beautiful view and provides one. The decor is subdued in an elegant way and it generally draws a quieter crowd.    
While Mastro's wasn't a life changing dining experience, between the high class menu and eye catching locale, it certainly did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Everything was great, you get what you pay for, etc., etc. but here's what you need to know. If you order a mixed drink, such as a gin and tonic - you will get a gin on the rocks with perhaps a 1/2 inch of room for tonic, which is provided in a separate bottle. Talk about a good pour!

If you don't like your drinks that strong, you might mention it up front."}
{"text":"Mastro's Ocean Club Las Vegas - I think we just had a bad night!  I didn't think it was all that... Good but not oh my gosh good. What really made it bad was our waiter.  When you spend a lot of money at a restaurant you expect great service and our waiter stood around talking and laughing with other waiters and barely paid any attention to us.  Our drinks were empty multiple times for long periods of time.  Took him forever to take our order and acted like he worked at a dinner instead of an upscale restaurant.  I'm sure if we had a different server I would feel better about spending hundreds of dollars on our meal but we got what we got and unfortunately I have to base my experience on that."}
{"text":"This place was very busy on a Thursday night and our party of 4 was seated in the farthest corner of the restaurant. I think they're racist because that corner also had the only Indian group on one table and a Hispanic party on another, with older snowbirds mixed in. The front tables by the entrance had the younger white crowd. 

Server was good and service from everyone was good.

Two filets were cooked a good medium but the ribeye was under. The sides were good as well as the butter cake for dessert and all in all a good meal. 

My complaint is with the sea bass. Every other time I've ordered it, it was about an inch and a half thick but this time it was like a pancake! Seriously not even a half inch thick and it tasted mushy since it was so thin and didn't have any char marks. 

Funny since we went there because of me and I had the worst meal."}
{"text":"After being disappointed at their Scottsdale location we decided to eat at this one and were glad we did. 

Her filet was cooked a perfect medium, mine was a medium when I asked for medium rare. But once I tried it, I didn't care, it was sooo good. 

Creamed spinach and mushrooms were both delicious. 

I wish you could order a split side instead of having to order two separate ones. It's just too much food, but I get it."}
{"text":"The bomb- awesome- just like the Beverly Hills place.
Not only is the food amazing- but they actually used alcohol
in there drinks  (unlike many places in Vegas)
We went on a Thursday night- and the eye candy of \"available\"
women waiting for clients was mind boggling.  
All the senses my senses were tickled at dinner."}
{"text":"This review is not about foods but about how the servers pushes its patrons to have more foods than what they wish to order. We had to repeat and tell our waiter \" No\" several times in respond to him asking us \"I can just double every order.\" If we wanted double of all our appetizers orders, we would have requested double. We came here yesterday to celebrate our best friend 40th birthday. We are a tight group of close friends and know each other likes and dislikes. We all love fine dining and enjoy Maestro Ocean club on a regular base. So it's disheartening for me to write this review as the foods and services have always been excellent in the many years we've dined at Maestro's establishment. (not this particular one) This was our first time at this Maestro in Vegas and because of this incident, we may not return here. We were charged 2x for majority of our appetizers dishes. We specifically told our waiter NOT to double as we like varieties and didn't want to fill up so much as our meals are always so filling. The night was fun and We didn't feel the need to check our bill. It wasn't the first time and Maestro have always given us superb service. But the next day, my friends and I all look over our bill, $2,286 for our large group of 16 but to have the waiter took it upon himself to ADD it to our order was a bit of a disappointment. I hope this is not a regular practice of this Maestro with large parties. So if you dine here, please check your bill and make sure to emphasize with the servers what you would like to \"Double\" or not."}
{"text":"Mastro's NEVER EVER EVER disappoints.  Service was stellar this trip just as it's been every other single time we've ever been here.  The Bone-in Tomahawk Ribeye is for to die, the lobster mashed potatoes are pure heaven, and OMG the Warm Butter Cake makes me weak in the knees.  Love Mastro's!!!"}
{"text":"Yummie!  This place was great. There was 9 of us for dinner for a friend's birthday, our table was ready and waiting for us when we arrived, they allowed us to decorate the table, the service was awesome, their menu includes steak & seafood so everyone could order whatever they wanted.  The restaurant was very busy I must say and every table had cocktails on it, both are good signs for me.

They have tons of steaks to choose from, lamb, vanilla fried lobster, scallops, and tons of fish. My only confusion came from how the fish was actually prepared b/c there wasn't really on the menu explaining how you can get your fish cooked. After asking the waitress, she explained the 5 fish preparations.

Here's what we ate:
1) Sashimi tower -white fish, Tuna, lobster rolls all very good [see pix]
2) Heirloom tomatoes and burrata salad-very tasty and tons to share
3) Escargot-my favorite very very good [see pix]
4) Creamed Corn-typically not a fan but I did enjoy this very much
5) Brussels Sprouts-eh they are good for you
6) Mac n blue cheese-yes for sure
7) Halibut Oreganata - almost $50, but was a huge piece of fish, definitely could share this
8) the fried lobster was another one of my favorites
9) tuna tostadas again very good [see pix]

I wanted to try the crab cake but didn't have any room left. We had more leftovers in bags then arms to carry them on.

Other notable notes: waiters were exceptional with their service of our table, my glass of Veuve was never empty and the waiter was calling me by name the whole time :).
Our bill was over a grand after everything was said and done. So it's on the pricer side."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!. The steak here is cooked at a ridiculously hot temperature and makes it taste better than anything in life. I got the 12 oz bone in filet and was not let down by the taste and quality of it. My family got the Chilean sea bass blackened and it is by far the best seabass I have ever had. The sides come out really hot in their own pans and we had the mac n cheese and green beans which were delicious. They have a great wine selection but the butter dessert cake really topped it off with the scoop of ice cream on top you just can't get enough of it. I can't wait to come back here next year because its something I look forward to that much. Service is awesome and Lionel is the best waiter who knows his stuff."}
{"text":"It started a bit off and continued.  We were sat at a table which did not accommodate our kids car seat (even after we specified that in the reservation). After we had to cram into the assigned table the meal and service was adequate.  
One meal both steak and crab was over cooked and presented with a cream sauce that I didn't order.  It took 20 minutes to get it remade and then came out with crab that was served like hash browns since they over cooked it  so much.  
The waiter Jesse was accommodating to his mistake but not once did a manager come over and offer any apology or words of wisdom.  After sending something back twice at a place like this you should not be charged for it.  And a manager should be all over it... not only was there no comp the server then upgraded what he brought me (crab wise) and charged me the difference.  Just overall a classless experience out of that server.  After many times at City Hall and competitor Eddie Vs I do not see what all the \"hype\" around ocean club is..."}
{"text":"Everything is always done perfect at Maestro's. The food, wine selection and a dessert with its own twitter site.
The only weird thing about this one is it's in the middle of a mall with very expensive stores. Steak place in the mall....hmmmm
Other than that, they are always spot-on with the best food and service.
If you never have been to one, you can't truly say you are a foodie. 
Warm butter cake!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My boyfriend and I went here our last night in Vegas. We had made reservations and got seated right away inside of the beautiful architecture. Our server Megan was extremely informative and attentive. She went through the menu and gave us some suggestions.

 We ordered some drinks and they brought out the huge bread basket, which had at least 4-5 types of bread. I really liked the pretzel bread and the cheese crisps. Our server brought out our drinks, The Paloma i ordered was excellent, not over powering but had wonderful refreshing grapefruit flavor.

 I ended up ordering the Oysters Rockefeller, Clear Lobster Roll and the Alaskan King Crab Gnocchi with Black Truffle. My boyfriend got the Chilean Sea Bass, wedge salad and sautéed asparagus. The oysters were juicy and full of flavor and honestly this was the best gnocchi I've ever had. It was rich and was full of crab and truffle. The lobster roll was okay, had good flavor. My boyfriend's fish was cooked perfectly and almost tasted like lobster. It went well with the asparagus and gnocchi.

 Our plates were cleared and Megan brought out a dessert menu, we were way too full for dessert. However, she brought us out a little pair of chocolate covered strawberries with fresh whip cream for a little sweet treat on the house! Service was impeccable, our water glasses were always full and we were definitely catered to. Megan our server made our experience a wonderful one, I highly recommend this place for a special occasion, it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Tried the famous Mastro's Ocean Seafood Club. Very unique dining facilities. The staff and management are first rate and the food menu is extensive. 

The Bone Marrow was generous, prepared well and tasty but I think the salted butter used on the marrow and toast points made it a little salty to our taste. I just downed more water as it was so good.

We shared a tossed salad with tomatoes, onion and shrimp and was very clean and delicious.

The main course of Chilean Sea Bass was grilled to perfection. The filet was a couple inches thick and not over grilled. It was flaky and very delicious - every bite. You may want to share it - it was so good.

The Bone in Rib Eye lacked the common fat eye. The meat was perfectly cooked med rare but the cut I got was tougher than I expected. Looking back at the experience I should have said something but I soldiered on and finished the meat. It would just be bad ju-ju not to finish it.

The sides were the Lobster Mash and Sautéed Spinach. The Lobster Mash was just ok. I like mash potatoes with a thicker texture and not as soupy as they present it. I'll pass on it next time.

The dessert was the famous butter cake. Oh man, this was great with coffee. However, after the amount of food we already consumed the desert was just too much to finish. It felt like a shame not to finish the dessert. The perfect portion for us would have be to share the dessert between four instead of two. 5,000 calories later

Overall the experience was positively memorable  - 5,000 calories later. A little loud at times. The staff did everything they could to make it a great night. The food was prepared well but in the case of the Rib-Eye was sub par. Chalk it up to sub-par cut of meat. I'll go to Mastro's again."}
{"text":"Always the best! Great service, perfectly prepared food and the best butter cake on the planet!"}
{"text":"Tried Mastro's for the first time on Saturday while staying in Vegas. Made a reservation on Yelp (super convenient and easy) for 5:15pm. Ended up coming 15 mins late because of traffic but was still seated right away after we arrived. If you do plan on coming here, leave about 30-40 mins (depends on traffic also) early since you do have to park/valet then walk into Crystals Mall located at Aria.

Appetizer - Tried the calamari and I would have to say I have had better. The calamari was reallllllly chewy. Some might prefer that but I don't believe calamari should be chewy. The only reason why it was enjoyable was the creamy sauce that came with it. I could eat the sauce by itself. It was THAT delicious. As a high-end restaurant, I was expecting better calamari, but Flemings and Ruth Chris both win on that dish.

Entree - Bone-in Filet and Bone-in Ribeye. The Filet was amazing! It was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. I usually get filet without the bone but decided to try something different and it did not do me wrong. The bone-in ribeye was good but not as good as the filet. It was soft in the center but the outside was too blacken for my taste. It was over-charred and slightly burnt in corners. Probably wouldn't get that again.

Sides- Lobster mashed potatoes.... WOW! Such a genius idea. $39 side... so you will expect something amazing and it was! So flavorful with lobster pieces in each bite. I will definitely get this again. Cream corn - nothing that stands out from other cream corn I have tried before. Though, I could tell the corn was cut from fresh corn, rather than using canned corn - which was a plus. 

Complimentary bread - variety... probably 4-5 different types.

Service - from a 1-10, I'd give about 7.5. Server wasn't as personable or attentive.

1 appetizer, 2 sides and 2 steaks came out to be $188."}
{"text":"Truly the best steak house in the country. Do not pass on the Butter cake it's unreal"}
{"text":"Best food EVER. Steak is perfectly cooked and lobster mash is to die for. Didn't really like the creamed spinach but the BUTTER CAKE YUMMY!!!!!! If you make a reservation ask to sit in Linus section. He is one of the best waiters EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Maestro's Ocean Club 6-7 times, and each time it does not disappoint - It . Is . Fabulous .  

This past weekend we ordered the Oyster's Rockefeller to start with and they were as delicious as always. For our entrees, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my boyfriend ordered the Filet Oscar Style - both dishes were amazing. Spinach and mushroom sides were also very good - this place is exceptional. For dessert we shared the key lime pie, and it was surprisingly a large slice - loved it! Usually we get the signature warm butter cake for dessert and it is heavenly. 

Overall, we love Maestros' Ocean Club. The service is always impeccable and then food outstanding. The bar area has live music and is a perfect place to people watch. The dining room on the other side is also very nice and a bit quieter. I would recommend Maestro's Ocean Club to anyone for any occasion or just a regular day."}
{"text":"RESOLUTION CAME TO AN END - Out of respect for the restaurant and reputation (prior to being sold) I was hoping to update my review to something more positive however unfortunately I'm not able!  The ambience hasn't changed, it's an AWESOME hot spot and I'd give it 5 Stars IF after they would have simply demonstrated good management skills by at least talking to me.  2 of our 4 party ordered the same dinner and both had the same issue for which we sincerely attempted to get the GM to know, affording him the opportunity to do something, anything - but instead in spite of him telling me he'd call me back in a day or two ( he wanted to discuss it with his chef), he never did.  A week later I called again and had to leave a message.  Oddly enough someone from the establishment reached out after seeing my pre-review \"PENDING RESOLUTION\" on Yelp and asked for details; I provided them and told her I had already spoken to the GM.  She too said she'd get back to be - I never heard back from her either.  So, in light  of this disappointing resolution, I would say........
GO, have fun, you'll love it.  It's not inexpensive and that's totally fine when it meets the minimum quality expectations.  I believe  they're still in a transition so I'm confident I'll be back - have dined here many times and always been pleased."}
{"text":"Before heading out for a night of partying at XS, my buddy and I found ourselves wandering around the Cosmopolitan looking for a good restaurant to try.  While the rest of our friends were grabbing dinner at the literal hole-in-the-wall pizza counter upstairs, we wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of trying something a little more unique.  Well, that is, assuming we could find somewhere that didn't have a crowd; each of our first few tries were met with wait times of 45 mins or longer.  Hoping for better luck at the mall at City Center next door, we eventually worked our way over to Mastro's Ocean Club to check things out there.  Greeted by a friendly hostess and the opportunity for immediate seating, our search came to an end.  Score for table seating by the bar!

For a while now, I've heard a number of good things about Mastro's from friends in LA.  From the service to the food, they've all mentioned how great their experiences were.  At the end of my meal, I could certainly see what they mean.  After perusing through the menu of seafood and steaks, I ended up going with the grilled Chilean Sea Bass with a side order of the Garlic Mashed Potatoes for my friend and I to split (rather, I wanted it for myself, but needed to \"share\" it to justify getting it).  Now, I know...ordering a fish dish on my first ever trip to Mastro's is pretty counter-intuitive considering their reputation as a steakhouse.  However, given that it's one of their two Ocean Club spots, I figured that maybe I should give the seafood a shot since I don't know if it'll be as readily offered at their pure steakhouse spots.

When our orders were brought to our table, I have to admit that it wasn't stunning at first glance.  Although the cut was larger than I had anticipated (which is never a bad thing), there wasn't much in terms of frills and dressing.  Since everything is a la carte, you literally get just the fish on the plate, with half a lemon on the side of seasoning.  Despite how lonely it may have looked though, there's no questioning the quality.  Although Chilean sea bass is generally more forgiving when it comes to cooking because of its fatty nature, this one was done perfectly regardless.  The meat was soft and tender, and it was moist throughout.  Flavor-wise, you couldn't ask for much more - modest seasoning to it, with a great buttery and velvety sort of flavor from the fish.  Excellent.

As for our sides, the Garlic Mashed was pretty good.  I liked the consistency (thick, but not gloppy or too thin), and the flavor wasn't too potent.  While I would generally prefer a stronger punch to it, it worked well to not overpower the sea bass.  In addition, my friend also slipped in an order of the skinny fries, and let me tell you - a \"basket\" of fries here really is a basket of fries.  The order was this huge mound of fried potato goodness, and even after chipping away at it throughout our meal, there was still plenty left for our other friend to snack on when he joined us.  Oh, and I can't forget to mention their bread basket either - all served hot and soft with salted butter.  All of the ones I tried were good, but my favorite was the toast-like bread with cheese...so good.

As for the rest of the experience, everything else was spot on.  Our server Sarah was awesome - really attentive, friendly, and pretty damn cute.  Now, I'm sure that last part MIGHT have had something to do with it, but seriously, really cute.  While it's kind of odd that it's located in a mall, I really liked the vibe of the place.  The main dining area is on a sort of a semi-open balcony (check out the pictures...quite a distinctive look), while they have a piano and singer by the bar.  While the music can make conversations a little tough, it's no worse than if you were sitting with a large group.
 
While I do somewhat regret not having ordered beef instead of fish, I have no complaints about what I had either (plus, was still under that damn zero/reduced beef pledge).  That said, I know I'll be back to try more of their menu anyways (saw several tables with the seafood tower), as well as to get a table in their \"tree house\" section.  Great ambiance for a date as well, and while not a cheap meal, it's certainly worth the price.  But then, that could just be my waitress-induced bias doing the talking too.."}
{"text":"**This review is for the bar area only**

I've heard many great things about this restaurant, and after reading other Yelp reviews I decided what better time to try this place out than my birthday? And what better way than sitting at the bar, and partaking of some artistically created adult beverages?

For starters this place is located smack in the middle of the Crystals Mall, you can't miss it. It's the big wooden orb shaped thing that seams to be floating in the center of all the action. It's pretty neat, but as other reviews mentioned, I'm not sure I'd want to spend $200+ on a dinner with a mall atmosphere. None the less it's quite a unique experience and they did a great job (at least in the bar area) of making sure their music drowned out most of the mall sounds.

I knew the drinks here would be pricey so I was prepared for it, but for others it may be a shocker. They have an extensive list of specialty drinks starting at $16, but most are $18. I was told their in-house specialty was a lemon drop which came over dry ice, I didn't actually try it though. I did try the Chocolate Martini ($18)- which won me over because of the giant chocolate covered strawberry on the side of the glass. It truly was dessert in a martini glass! Other views were correct, when you order a martini they give you the shaker along with your drink so you can refill your glass, it's almost like 2 drinks in 1. I also tried the Banana Foster ($18), it was delicious but not what I expected. It has whipped cream, I expected it on top but it was shaken inside and gave the drink a bit of a lumpy texture.

The bf tried the Mastro's Mojito (also $18) and it honestly was not very good, it  came served in a tall glass so there was no shaker on the side. I wouldn't recommend ordering this one. His mom tried the Dragon Fire ($18), which as very tasty, but yes it was hot/spicy - not something to quench your thirst. She rounded off her evening with the Flur de Blu ($18), one I was considering as well. She liked it, but after I tried it I was glad I went with the dessert-style drinks instead.

The service was good. The bar wasn't busy so we had as much attention as we wanted. We were able to watch them make our drinks and that was a fun part of the experience. We saw all kinds of great food coming out of the kitchen so we asked for a food menu, we elected not to order anything since we'd already been there a while and run up a tab of $100. However one bar tender offered to bring us a bread basket. The bread was great and the basket came with several different types of bread, and super soft butter. Note to self for next time: ask for the bread basket when you arrive, it's free.

I think I'll drop in some time again, when I'm in the mood for a dessert martini and can afford the $18 drinks."}
{"text":"Every single time we go to Las Vegas, we make sure to make reservation with Mastro's right after hotel reservation... I love to eat at bird cage... Service is EXCELLENT!!!  They do everything possible to make me feel welcome all the time."}
{"text":"Mastros always has a special place in my heart, I can't come to Vegas without making a stop here for dinner one night. 

The service is always great along with the food. I always get the following:

Burrata salad
Bone in filet
Grilled asparagus 
Scalloped potatoes
Moscow mule

I've also tried the Truffle gnocchi (on the salty side just FYI)

You can't leave here without having their amazing buttercake! It's the great ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Ahhhh feel the privilege! This where the geriatrics go to feel socially accepted. Be aware, you will most likely run into Raven, she's everywhere the 50+ crowd congregates. 

The old piano and singer duo covers such modern day hits as Sublime and anything that was popular at least 10 years ago.

My $15 salad was in reality about $3 worth of food. I guess they need to pay for the elaborate bread bowl you can gorge yourself on prior. 

The bowtie man is very aggressive at identifying plates as to fulfill his life's mission of collecting dirty plates and continues hovering over my table as I attempt to enjoy my meal.

The upside is well there is none but hey you spent the day screwing over the American people in some form or fashion why not take a write off and bring joe from the office to have dinner with the family? You can afford to throw away $75 on a cheap corn fed steak disguised as quality meat, because you're rich, so who cares? Let loose and partay like it's 1944!"}
{"text":"Great food!! 
Love their lobster mashed potatoes. Great service and very friendly. Unfortunately, our check took forevaaaa to come! LOL. Other than that, def would recommend.  

Can be a quite busy so make sure to plan for your reservation."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner was fabulous! I forgot to take pictures:( bc food was so delicious!! Started off with Calamari for appetizer, comes with a sweet and sour sauce. I ordered the Chilean Sea bass, lobsters mashed potatoes- to die for! Servers were very attentive and friendly. Our bill was pretty high but th e manager was kind enough to waive our anniversary dessert,  choc cake, fresh raspberries & homemade whipped cream."}
{"text":"Located in the Crystals at City Center, you can't miss this place as part of it sits in something that's supposed to be a sculpture called \"the tree\".  The sculpture itself is lost on most.  At any rate, my girl and I were in to celebrate a special occasion and Mastro's just happened to fit the bill for what we were looking for.

We started with Oysters on the half shell along with a Lobster Bisque.  The oysters were a good size, not too briny and of the east coast variety.  The Lobster Bisque was excellent.  Chunks of lobster and the soup itself was neither watery nor too thick but with proper consistency and the temperature just perfect.  Main courses consisted of Chilean Sea Bass for her and the Scottish Salmon Filet.  I put my trust in the chef and opted to be surprised in the preparation of my salmon, and I was not disappointed as everything was prepared exactly as requested.  Sides to accompany the entrees were the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and some sauteed Asparagus.  Drinks to accompany the meal was a nice Sauvignon Blanc (the name escapes me) which went with everything as per recommended by our server.

Service-wise:  very attentive.  Our server ran through all of the specials for the night and answered any questions we may have had including selecting the wine to go with our entire meal start to finish on top of being entertaining.  If a course was complete, someone was present to take the item away.  Our glasses were never empty and staff (including the manager) made it a point to be sure that our needs were met and that everything was fine.  Bonus points for giving us a table right along the edge inside of the \"tree\" sculpture.  

Word of warning:  portions are quite generous so either be prepared to share or come hungry.  

In short:  Top-notch service, good food, quality that pairs equally with the price.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mastro's in Beverly Hills so I did not expect this one to meet the same high standard but boy was I wrong!  The service here was excellent!  We had a large party and they accommodated us with ease and the food was delectable!  Definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas now."}
{"text":"The ambiance was pretty rad. It's not you're usual dimly lit steakhouse. It's right in the middle of Crystal and very bright. I liked the modern decor and the live music was a nice touch. The service was great. The bathroom attendant made me feel like I was a a club. 

My bone-in filet (12ox) was tasty, but I personally miss the crisp edges and extra butter on the Ruth Chris' steak. The Mastro side dishes though, definitely beat Ruth Chris'. I loved the Truffled Gnocchi, Lobster Mash Potatoes, Sweet Potato Fries, and Oysters Rockefeller. 

My highlight of the night was the butter cake! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Well, I did a poor job of keeping up with the reviews to become Elite but hey Yelp gave it to me anyways since Im so hilarious. So, I'm back!

Mastros is one of the few steakhouse chains that I would say can compete with the best steakhouses around. Ive been to a few in California and all are great. The one in Vegas keeps the tradition alive and well. Crystals is a swanky shopping area in the Strip so this is definitely a place you'd expect to drop some serious coin. And this is Vegas so if you aren't planning on it then you can leave.

Chopped Salad- well it was salady. Standard dish and easy to split.

Bone in Filet 12 oz- Probably the best filet I've had in Vegas. Cooked perfect medium rare.

Lobster Mash- obvi delicious but probably an unnecessary 30 dollar side.

Roasted Brussel sprouts- Idk how they cooked these but they were the best brussel sprouts Ive had period. Even my father who hates them couldn't deny that they were great.

Warm Butter Cake- Ah yes the buttery goodness. One of my favorite desserts whenever it's on a menu no matter the restaurant. Mastro's does it right.

The reason Mastro's is legit is that it keeps the traditional steakhouse vibe of olden times and perfects it. None of menu items are crazy out there or artistic concoctions like at GR Steak but the quality of the food is not debatable. There is no chain steakhouse as good as Mastro's let me tell you."}
{"text":"Honestly - one of the best new York strips I've had... just amazing.

Martinis are easily 3 drinks and well worth the $19 price tag.

The best meal I've ever had in Vegas."}
{"text":"My friend and I were looking for a simple sushi restaurant near our hotel, Aria but the one inside the hotel was booked.  So we walked over to the next building and finally decided on Mastro's since I loved the one in Beverly Hills.  

It didn't disappoint..the service was A+..our waitress kept a close eye on us to refill any drinks and was very knowledgable about the menu.  The Maine lobster was exquisite and the asparagus crisp and seasoned.  My poor friend ordered sushi which she didn't like because there was chocolate in the sauce.  Chocolate?!?  The lemon drop martini was awesome.  It came to the table smoking and kept on smoking for awhile. . We shared a delicious dessert.  $250 dinner for two..well worth it.

Ambiance was superb in the treehouse..
Service was respectful, reliable and solid..
Food was delish.."}
{"text":"Who eats seafood in Arizona?!? 
Well,... i did. Last week, and it was excellent. Great atmosphere, although to me it felt more like a date night kinda atmosphere. I was there with some colleagues from work. The ambiance and service was super. Those in our party who tried the steak said it was very good (the steaks were brought out on searing hot plates). Definitely expensive."}
{"text":"This was out second trip to a Mastros steakhouse and it would be hard to top the experience in Scottsdale. The food was excellent and the service was attentive and friendly. The waiter had just a little trouble pouring the wine, but other than that he did an outstanding job and was very efficient. I prefer a darker feel to a steakhouse and with the Ocean club being in the mall that was hard to achieve. Overall I would definitely go again. Bone in rib eye was a little undercooked but excellent. And the butter cake dessert off the hook good."}
{"text":"Who wouldn't love a restaurant that's positioned right next to Tiffany's??  Seriously.......

I went for a company dinner so cannot attest to the price (although based on other Yelpers, the cost is quite steep!)  Started with a lovely bread basket with a wide variety of different breads, including \"pretzel bread\" which is quite similar to Joe's Stone Crab bread.  The bruschetta appetizer came next which was VERY oniony, but it's a good thing I'm a big fan of onions because I absolutely loved it.  Caesar salad was just so-so.

Then the main course....I got the mahi mahi in this fancy butter sauce which was excellent, but not as good as my husband's salmon (I almost stole his plate it WAS THAT GOOD).  The fish portions were very large and filling.  Sides for the table included creamy mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  The spinach was a little salty for my taste, but not grainy at all.

Dessert was cheesecake with whipped cream and berries which was creamy and decadent...A+ even though I was completely full I ate the whole thing.

Would I return to Mastros?  Absolutely.  Wonderful ambience and GREAT salmon.....after all it is an \"ocean club\" so the fish has to be good right?  Cheers!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Vegas.  Great seafood.  Make sure to get the Seafood tower"}
{"text":"Out in Las Vegas for a week and this restaurant is my new favorite on the strip. We were late for our reservation and the hostess was very nice and very accomadating. The fish and seafood were some of the best I have had. I have seen on the food network how the desert flies in the best seafood, but this restaurant really proved it. to top it off the restaurant called the next day and made sure everything was great. 5 stars for this place and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best meals I have had in a long time.  Everything at Mastro's is great-- from the service to the ambiance to the food, the whole evening was really enjoyable.  

I don't even usually like shrimp cocktail, but it is really exceptional at Mastro's.  The jumbo shrimp is delicious and the over the top \"smoking\" presentation is pretty amazing.  

The steak is obviously great, but I could have eaten just sides all night.  The creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and roasted Brussels sprouts were all delicious.

Since I was there with a big group we also sampled several desserts.  I know a steak meal can be filling, but try to save room.  Highlights included the chocolate pudding cake and the key lime pie.

A great restaurant for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first visit to Mastro's on New Year's Eve....and had the most fabulous fine dining experience! The food and drinks were fantastic, the atmosphere wonderful and our server Sam (Samantha) was absolutely made our dining experience one to remember....in fact, we went back just this past weekend for my husband's birthday....and Sam greeted us, welcomed us back although she wasn't our server, she was checking that our dining experience was good. Nice touch, for a server to remember a couple in the midst of the hundreds that she assists (that's attention to detail if you ask me). 

Our first visit we enjoyed their delicious bread basket (pretzel bread my fav), Lobster Bisque (dare I say, the best ever tasted...and that's coming from someone that grew up in Monterey with some of the best seafood anywhere), lamb (again, the best ever tasted), filet, sautéed green beans....and topped off with their signature warm butter cake! And can't forget the smoothest and delicious Lemon Drop cocktail....love the dry ice effect! 

We had another fabulous dining experience that evening for my husband's birthday just this past weekend with Craig as our server. This time we started we took it lighter and slower to enjoy.....starting with their spinach salad and decided to split the 22oz Ribeye that I had read about and recommended...they kindly split it up on 2 separate plates for us (without us asking), sautéed asparagus.....and was topped off with a birthday crème brulee (my hubby's fav dessert)....I wasn't much of a brulee fan....until I tried theirs....smooth, creamy, delicious vanilla bean custard!

We won't miss a visit on our future Vegas visits...even if just to sit at the bar for appetizers, bisque, drinks and dessert!"}
{"text":"LOVE Mastros!  Dinner was perfect - atmosphere even better!  The tree house is so fun and innovative!  The piano bar was a great way to start our dinner.  The singer was perfect!  Our cocktail waitress was too cute for words and made the night even better!

The food at Mastros speaks for itself!  Among our favorites:
*Filet - I like the petite my husband the bone in
*Creamed Corn - a MUST
*Potatoes - all of them are good - if I could I would do one of each :)

All in all - GREAT doesn't even begin to say how much we love Mastros!  A must for everyone!"}
{"text":"Mastro's is AMAZING! Every single thing I have tried at this restaurant is DELICIOUS. Their dining room is very unique yet has a classy fine dining feel to it. My favorite tables are located within the \"tree house\" because who doesn't want to be in a tree house? =)

I've been there a bunch of times and below are some of my favorite food items:
- Alaskan King Crab Legs - (Available by the pound) Comes out warm and ready to eat with the shells already cracked open. They serve it with melted butter but I prefer their cocktail sauce instead.
- Cocktail Sauce - Yes, I put this in it's own category LOL. It's AMAZING. This is the best cocktail sauce I have ever had. It has the perfect amount of kick.
- Shrimp Cocktail - huge, plump, and delicious! One order includes 3 shrimps. It comes out in an entertaining presentation because of the dry ice below the bed of ice.
- Dungeness Crab Cocktail - This is probably the best value for the seafood tower appetizers. You get a bunch of crab meat with a few different sauces: cocktail (again, its the best!), Mastro's mustard, and extra horse radish (super strong). 
- Bone-In Rib Eye - They seem to cook a little more on the rare side. Possibly because the plate comes out at 400 degrees. (Be careful!) The meat tastes fabulous alone but they do offer Bearnaise and Peppercorn sauce as an option.
- Sea Scallops - Perfectly cooked and savory (Appetizer portion has 3, Entree portion has 5.)
- Signature Warm Butter Cake - THIS IS THE BEST DESSERT EVER!!!! Warm butter cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and served with a huge side of whipped cream. It is quite large and well worth the price! Serves 3-4 people easily. 

The service is genuine and attentive. If you put any notes in your reservation such as a special celebration, they pay close attention to it. It was so nice to not worry about telling the server it was my boyfriend's birthday.

I know I listed a bunch of my favorites, but if you could take away anything from this review, TRY THE BUTTER CAKE! =)"}
{"text":"Drooling to return!!!

Wow...wow...and I mean wow! Far beyond any expectations! Since we were here for a birthday celebration we decided to go all out and order close to everything -can't finish? no prob, mini fridge in hotel room was waiting :) ...and every single dish was pure perfection. The lobster mash was humongous and delish with lots of lobster pieces, meats were tender, fish buttery, service sublime (checked on us without disturbing & smiled when serving), ended with desert to die for. DO NOT skip the warm butter cake, unless you're diabetic or out of your mind. 

A rare find of friendly attentive service and food that's worth every dollar! Bravo! I'll be sending everyone I know. Seriously can't wait to return!

ps,
You can't miss this place. Swing by if only for a peak at the unusual design. Center of the Crystals shopping center in a spiral treehouse looking architecture."}
{"text":"I love Mastro's!  We went for our first anniversary dinner after having gone on our honeymoon last year. The food was so amazing we had to come back.  We were greeted at our table with 2 glasses of champagne to celebrate. We spilt the most delicious wedge salad and it was good. Last year we had apps and the lobster mashed potatoes as a side. Those were so good they'll make you wanna slap your momma!  We were so full I am embarrassed to say we didn't even finish our steaks. This year we switched to Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese...epic!  I had the bone-in ribeye and my wife ordered the 12oz filet mignon.  Both were the finest steaks we've ever had. You will never appreciate any other steak after that. Mastros ruined steak for me, talk about melt in your mouth. Our server Mark was phenomenal and super attentive. A really nice guy. For desert they brought out the warm butter cake...wonderful!  Mastros is the only place I would eat in my life if I had the choice. Thank you  for a wonderful first anniversary dinner. GO THERE!!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here with my daughter and parents. We started off with Mastro's Seafood Tower. You can create your own seafood tower to your liking and size. Our seafood tower had shrimp, snow crab claws and oysters. We all enjoyed especially my daughter; the cool dry ice effect and seafood tower presentation. The seafood was fresh and the oysters tasted amazing. My hubby had the lemon sole, my mom had the Chilean sea bass, my Dad had the herb roasted chicken, I had sauteed sea scallops and my daughter got to sample a little bit of everything. We shared two sides family style of their signature lobster mashed potatoes (love this combo) and the other side dish of roasted brussels sprouts. The seafood and chicken entrees and sides were served hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned. At the end, they complimentary served us their yummy signature warm butter cake dessert with vanilla ice cream and added Happy Anniversary wish which was a nice added personal touch. We had a wonderful time and food experience on our first visit here, and the service was friendly and excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to celebrate special occasions and loved it. From the Main lobster tail that's always so juicy to the steaks, I've tried a few but recently my husband got the tomahawk steak, they cut like butter and is always cooked to perfection. The lobster mash potatoes are phenomenal not to mention the world famous butter cake. This location is a little bit brighter and more of an open space. I've been to one other location that had more of an dark intimate feel."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite restaurants! If you have never tried the lobster mashed potatoes, you are missing out! Other items I would recommend are the shrimp cocktail, ahi tuna, and the cosmopolitan which is served with dry ice giving it an appealing presentation. The service here is the best and the food is amazing! I wish we had one of these in the 405, but until then, I will hit them up whenever I'm in Vegas or DC. If you visit the Vegas location, it is located in the Crystal Mall in its very own treehouse, which is very unique. There's no other place like it!"}
{"text":"1.) The wait staff was inattentive. 
2.) Sommelier (via waitress) brought out the wrong bottle of wine.
3.) Lamb was medium well when asked for medium rare.
4.) Swordfish was raw and under seasoned.

Front and back of the house need help."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and we were disappointed this week. Our heirloom tomatoes are soft and near rotten. The grouper had an ammonia taste to it. My grilled salmon was very bland. The best item was the dessert butter cake and whip cream. To summarize, disappointed and expensive."}
{"text":"We couldn't make our initial reservation and was disappointed but when we checked in to the Aria and noticed it was located in the Crystal shops, we decided to have a late dinner after shopping. 

The ambiance was unique, in a good way. Our server Daniel gave us exceptional service - he was very attentive and accommodating. We ordered the Rack of Lamb, Scallops and the Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese! Everything was cooked to perfection and well seasoned aka tasty. 

We were not disappointed and happy we were able to experience Mastro's Ocean Club before leaving Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this was the best and most indulgent meal I have ever had in my life!  My husband and I had the seafood tower appy, a bottle of fabulous wine, and split the Wagyu beef and a HUMONGOUS lobster.  Everything was completely amazing.  The cost of the meal made my heart stop for a few minutes ($750 with tip)...but it was a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing.  Bucket list stuff."}
{"text":"We really enjoy dropping in to Mastro's Ocean Club for a drink or a nice meal at the bar. Charelle is great. She will take care of you guys for sure. Mastro's is located inside Crystals mall in the City Center. We were there on a Sunday night and just had the most pleasant time. 

We had just an appetizer with our drinks. We got the calamari. It was good. It was all calamari rings in a seasoned breading. Delicious... You can never go wrong with calamari and theirs is one of the better ones. We also had the famous signature warm butter cake. DAMN... That really is a delicious dessert. It is like the most perfect butter pound cake topped with a tasty vanilla ice cream, surrounded with strawberry & baby orange slices and drizzled with strawberry sauce. It's so good. It's so rich but worth it if you share it. The bottom of the butter cake has a caramelized crust so when you get to that bite, you're in for a flavor kick. So good. You have to get it... I'm glad we finally tried it. 

Service at the bar was exceptional. Charelle, the bartender, made a perfect dirty ketel martini and was such a pleasant person to conversate with. Mastro's is lucky to have her. We enjoyed our time at the bar with her and appreciated her suggestions & customer service. Make sure you look for her. Thank you Mastro's Ocean Club and Charelle! We'll  be back soon... In a few weeks, in fact!"}
{"text":"So, I think I just found my new favorite seafood place, and its only 10 minutes from work. SCORE.
Lobster mashed potatoes, Lobster mashed potatoes, Lobster mashed potatoes. The best thing you can order, I swear. You have to order this if you are a fan of mashed potatoes.
 If you like a little spice.. the jalepeno tuna sashimi. Its the highest quality fish I've had and its got a mild spice to it. delicious. 

They also have a great wine list. 
I loved the live music and the song choices are amazing. Oh, third eye blind, john mayer, and dave matthews band? I think I'm in love."}
{"text":"Staying at the Aria and a small group of us went to Mastros for dinner. No reservation so sat at high top in bar area. I had the griller red snapper which was well prepared. A couple split a filet and other had chop salad and all said great. The cocktails were friendly and plentiful with quick service. I split Mac and cheese with a buddy but we only ate half despite great flavor. A little expensive but would definately do again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the hostess was very rude when I tried to make a reservation.  Her name is Bianca.  She said we could only make our reservation at 5:30pm or 8 pm.  If we chose the 5:30pm time we would have to leave by 7:45pm and that she would make a note to the server that we would leave by 7:45pm.  
We have dined here numerous times, spending $275 on average for 2 people.  I don't want to be on time constraints when enjoying a night out for dinner.  You just lost a loyal customer Ocean Club!"}
{"text":"I am a mastro fan and I have been to a few different ones. Pros for this particular place: staff is extremely friendly (some other places like LA they were stiff and kinda annoying), food is delicious (the butter cake is a must), spacious. The only con is that it's in a mall setting which was a little weird. But I still enjoyed the meal and I am looking forward to the next meal here."}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, service, and atmosphere.  Make sure to get the lobster mashed potatoes and request to sit in the \"tree house\"!"}
{"text":"Stellar experience. 
Hideously expensive but expected on the strip. 
Huge selection of wines
Amazing food. 
   - good bread
   - first rate seafood
   - delicious steaks
   - fabulous sides
   - decadent desserts
First class service. 

As long as I am not footing the bill, I would return here anytime.   Las Vegas Strip signature restaurants are known as much for the huge price tag as well as quality food/service."}
{"text":"I searched, for the perfect Vegas restaurant, for our anniversary dinner, by checking the internet, asking friends, and tallying #YELP, Open Table, and Trip Advisor scored. I started with a long list and ended up, with Mastro's. And, it was the perfect setting, to celebrate our anniversary. 
We travelled all morning. Checked in our hotel and walked all over the strip, during the day. So, we were a little tired, by dinner, but were up, for celebrating, with delicious food and wine.  
We had a table, in the \"treehouse\".
We ordered a bottle of The Prisoner wine, because we were splurging. It was delicious, and went well with our meal.
The bread basket they brought out was this bread lovers dream; huge, wide assortment of yummy goodness, with butter. 
We had the crab cake appetizer. The crab cakes were very large, and scrumptious, with not much filling, just lots of crabmeat. 
The Lobster Bisque was very nice. 
We shared Blackened Scotch Salmon, which was delicious, but thankfully, not huge, cut in half. The lobster Mac 'n Cheese side is sinful. 
They brought us a complimentary dessert, for our anniversary. We were able to squeeze in a few bites. 
The service was as you would expect, in a higher end, very nice restaurant. Our waiter and all the staff were courteous and helpful. 
Without the $100 bottle of wine, the meal was still pricey, but it was worth it. This is a great place to celebrate something/anything!"}
{"text":"HIgh quality up market steak house. I like the location in Vegas you are seated in this amazing hardwood balcony/nest in the middle of an expensive mall. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"22oz Ribeye is outstanding!
Warm butter cake is the perfect desert!"}
{"text":"Great service! Went for my brothers 26th birthday, there was consistent service and great quality food. The petite filet was cooked medium rare plus and it went perfect with the creamed, macaroni and cheese and two bottles of wine. The butter cake was a perfect ending to our mouth watering meal. My family and I will definitely be returning again"}
{"text":"By far the ugliest mastros I've ever been to. Honestly the restaurant was just sad. Went there for my bday dinner and I was very underwhelmed. It's located inside the crystal shopping center. Literally looks like the Starbucks located across from the restaurant. The food was not great. The service was ok and the drinks were filled with cheap vodka. It was basically eating at sizzer"}
{"text":"Another bookmark that took us a while to check off, Mastro's Ocean Club is located at the Crystals Shops.  We celebrated Valentine's Day two days early to avoid all the crowds on the actual day.  We arrived at the appointed reservation time and were seated promptly in the \"birds' nest\" area of the restaurant.  All I've heard from friends about Mastro's centers around the Signature Warm Butter Cake dessert and we did have that, but first, dinner.  After perusing the menu and hearing the options available, I settled on surf and turf with the petite filet mignon (6 oz.) Oscar-style with crab meat and Bearnaise sauce.  According to our waiter, the meat of two large crab legs comes with the filet and when it was served, this did actually seem to be the case.  The dish was just the perfect size for me, plus we shared a large twice-baked potato.  Service throughout our meal was attentive, but not cloyingly so:  our glasses were never empty for long.  Oh, I forgot to mention the bread basket that came to the table first:  a carb lover's dream! We counted three different kinds of bread:  pretzel bread, garlic bread, and sourdough with the pretzel bread being my definite favorite.  
As I mentioned, we finally got to try the famous butter cake served with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on the side:  heavenly!  
Mastro's is definitely a wonderful choice for a special occasion when you want to spoil yourselves."}
{"text":"Sea bass is a must! The fillet mignon is superb too. Unfortunately, my warm butter cake was way too hard and dry. Even the ice cream didn't help the dryness."}
{"text":"We live in LV, and eat all the time at the high end strip restaurants.  This is probably the easiest 5 star rating I have ever given.  Everything was fantastic, and I went in with very high expectations.  A friend recommended, and said it was one of the best steaks in LV.  I was not disappointed. Steak had terrific flavor, and melted in your mouth.  Drinks, appetizers, main courses, sides, and desserts - all were simply fantastic.  We also loved the atmosphere, and our waiter was excellent.  We will certainly return."}
{"text":"There's really nothing negative to say about this place. The petite filet was amazing, it was cooked to perfection. The sides were delicious. We had the cream of corn, sauteed spinach, mac & cheese and mushrooms. Service was great and the atmosphere was lovely. 

I'm just disappointed I wasn't able to try everything on the menu but the next time I'm in Vegas, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars. First timer here. Regular at City Hall so a gal pal of mine wanted to do ocean club, why the hell not? Needed to try it. 

Neither her or I do seafood but steaks all the way. 

Got the 8oz filet, medium. It came out pretty rare but luckily the plate is hotter than an oven so I cut it open all over and pushed it around the plate. Became perfect. 

Got a 4 stars cuz the filet had some grizzle on it and the buttercake seemed like it was sitting out for a bit, not hot like usual. 

Still a very good meal but ill stick to city hall"}
{"text":"So painful to give Mastro's a 3 star rating. I live in AZ and we have three separate mastros that are all great - eat there all the time. 

We were in town for the weekend and we came here with a party of 4. I always get my filet medium at mastros and it usually comes out at about medium rare to medium because of the plate being hotter than the oven. I got my 8oz filet and about 1/3 was a little too cooked. The meat was great but unfortunately a little over cooked. 

Now is the time for BUTTERCAKE. If you look back at my reviews of all the Mastros around the country, I highlight the buttercake every time. Greatest dessert ever. Our other guests never had it, so of course I was hyping it up big time. Our first buttercake was very burnt - inside was completely hard and 2/3s was not edible at all. So we waved down our waiter and he runs back to get another. Second one comes out and unfortunately its the same burntness. By that time, we were over it and just said take it back and take it off our bill. Very disappointed in this - first time ever this has ever happened."}
{"text":"I thought this place was pretty cool.  Very, very nice and classy inside.  However,  service left something to be desired and it smelled like fish.  There were three of us at the bar and the waitress charged me for my friend's tab- which was about 50 dollars more than mine.  Still waiting for the bank to sort it out.  We had to wait a long time to get drinks.  I did like the band.  Apparently they play Wed-Sat, or maybe to Sunday.  Not sure.  But they were good.  Next time I will just get my own drinks at the bar and pay in cash."}
{"text":"This is my hubby and my favorite restaurant. We happen to live part time in Scottsdale and travel extensively and it's still or fav. Our only complaint is why did they move the high top tables and chairs so close to the bar a couple of months ago? Typically if we don't get there soon enough to find a seat at the bar we will politely wait for 2 seats to open up. They lack of space behind the bar stools makes it virtually impossible to wait in this area. Very awkward and uncomfortable now."}
{"text":"We are Loyal Mastro's customers and visit the SoCal locations often, so we were pretty devastated after tonight's experience. Never have we felt so terrible paying the bill. 

He ordered the bone-in ribeye and I ordered the \"Chilean sea bass,\" which our waitress said was their most popular fish dish. The ribeye was great, flavorful, and juicy. Pretty in line with the quality of steak we've had in the past. 

The sea bass, however, was an entirely different story. I am 99% sure we were served the wrong dish. I've had Chilean sea bass countless times, and my fish tasted nothing like it. The shape was long and narrow. The texture was extremely dry and almost chalky. I ordered it with the parm crust and literally the only thing that gave it flavor was the lemon I squeezed on it. The fish was extremely bland and it was actually hard to eat. I should have sent it back but didn't want to be that person. I'm not a picky eater, so this was particularly bad.

Even the bread didn't taste as piping hot and magical as the bread we're used to. 

The service was fine though. 

Absolutely the saddest dining experience during our Vegas trip ever."}
{"text":"In short, our meal was absolutely phenomenal-- perhaps one of the best we've ever had in Vegas. With every element of the meal nearly flawless, I could not keep marveling over each little detail of our experience. Yelp here has Mastro's at a 4.5+ average on 250+ reviews..this is no fluke! 
We came here for my mom's birthday dinner and my expectations were MORE than exceeded.

We were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation within the \"Tree House,\" as the hostess called it; it had a very loft feel to it yet was very quaint had a warm, welcoming atmosphere. I'll definitely ask to be sat in this area again. 
As we passed by the bar area, we were greeted by spectacular live music, consisting of a woman singing accompanied by a fantastic piano player (who also added in some vocals). Big plus for this. 
After immediately seating us, the hostess hurried to bring us black napkins to avoid the lint of white napkins attaching itself to our dark clothing. We didn't even ask. Nice touch. 

Rob, our waiter, and the rest of the waitstaff that took care of our table were nothing but spectacular. I was a bit worried at first as my water glass remained empty for a good 15 minutes, but this was the sole flaw of the entire evening (and a minor one at that). Rob was extremely congenial, professional, yet very personable and extremely accommodating of our wishes. 

We like to split things a lot when we go out to dinner so that we get our own little smorgasbord of items to try...and a smorgasbord we got! Not only this, but the chefs made sure to split nearly everything that came to the table (even the bone-in steak we ordered!) Now, where do I even begin...

--Vanilla Battered Shrimp: Caution: Oxymoron... MASSIVE shrimp. The biggest shrimp I've seen in recent memory. The batter wasn't really too vanilla-tasting in my opinion, but this was a delicious starter regardless. Three to an order! 

--Burrata & Heirloom Tomato Salad: Mmm, burrata cheese is one of my favorites! Yes, this was a typical salad, but the tomatoes were so fresh and the balsamic reduction was so tasty. We asked for a little bit more of this said reduction and they brought out an entire cup of it..whoops.

--Clam Chowder: Hands down the best I've ever had. Not overly thick and creamy, yet perfect proportions of ingredients. Piping hot when it arrived which I really appreciate with soups. 

--Mac & Cheese: Ugh my mouth just waters at the thought of this. Served in a skillet, the mac and cheese was perfect consistency: it wasn't drowning in sauce but it wasn't just a bowl of plain noodles with an ounce of cheese mixed in...perfect proportions (once again). On top was a layer of melted cheese that was just fantastic...I think that there were four cheeses or so just in this topper! 

--Bone-in Filet Mignon: I really don't like throwing out the \"best I've ever had\" card very often. Because, honestly, how many things can take that title? Well, this definitely takes the \"best filet I've ever had\" title. Join the club, clam chowder. It had the taste of a NY Strip, but was tender as a filet should be. And, to top it off, it is served on a 400 degree hot plate. I like my steak kept hot and this obviously got the job done. 

--Warm Butter Cake: Okay, now this piece of heaven really takes the cake (ha, horrible pun intended). My mom and sister are suckers for butter cake (who isn't..?) and we figured what better time to order it than for a birthday? Out comes this large, circular cake and a BEHEMOTH side of whipped cream. Really. View my picture to see how much there was. Think of a frozen skillet just bombarded with thick, heavy whipped cream. Fantastic dessert. And what's even better? Rob comped this $16 dessert with the simple message of \"happy birthday, we're so happy you came in to dine with us tonight.\" Winnnnnnn.


From now on, every time I'm asked for a restaurant recommendation, Mastro's will be the first word to escape my mouth. I cannot wait to go there again next time I've got a few bucks to blow."}
{"text":"The meal I had was pretty good but it definitely wasn't mind blowing. I had the Pacific Swordfish cook perfectly but the taste wasn't making my tastebuds swoon."}
{"text":"The place is really cool.  Although it opens up to an enclosed high end retail, they do an excellent job of making the place very interesting. 

We did that surf and turf for 2 and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of over the top dining that I like to treat myself to once in a while. Gorgeous white tablecloth service, servers in white sportscoats, beautiful bar. I wish I could have spent 3 hours drinking my way through the meal and probably will allow myself that much time next visit. 

I had the 12oz bone in filet, it was excellent. Our table ordered the gnocchi & crab as a side dish. Delicious even for $26.  

It's a tiny bit awkward that it's in the middle of a massive shopping mall, for this kind of evening I wish I could just put on a nice dress and heels, take a cab and have a doorman open the restaurant door for me instead of trekking through a gi-normous mall up and down escalators to get there. However they make up for it with a cool bar and outstanding service."}
{"text":"OK experience.  Not likely to go back given all the other options in Vegas.  Surprised at how strong many of the reviews are.  I feel misled by Yelp on this one.

Service was great.  Ambiance not great.  You are in a shopping mall and you will be starting across the mall at retail stores and shoppers.

Food quality was good, but expensive for ambiance.  Good balance of seafood and steak house."}
{"text":"Food:
- special bacon appetizer (delicious)
- crab cocktail (AMAZING!)
- sea scallops (too salty)
- sea bass (great texture, too salty)
- brussel sprouts (too salty)
- butter cake (very strong butter flavor)

In general, I was underwhelmed by this place. Everything was too salty and this butter cake everyone raved about was not my cup of tea. I guess I don't like butter flavor. I'd rather have a chocolate cake or key lime pie. 

Service: top notch as expected. 

Location: inside the mall so the ambiance is not what I'd want for the price paid. Awkward to be staring at a store from your seat. 

So many other high end options available, I'd rather go to a restaurant that is not in the mall."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly great experience. We Spent our day at the pool and worked up quite an appetite. Always wanted to try Mastros but weren't sure if we would be welcome in our casual pool attire. Amazingly enough our server Shauna (not sure what her last name is) treated us as if we were dressed to the nines. We felt very comfortable and had a great meal. The food was excellent especially the escargot and lobster soup. Definitely coming back next time we are in town"}
{"text":"Friday night team dinner with my coworkers at Mastro's. We'd been planning for a while but schedules kept getting in the way. I'm glad we finally made reservations and went because wow. Just wow. 

Made our reservation for 5 on OpenTable and when we arrived, we were instantly seated. Our server got us waters while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive, then he went through menu and drinks with us. We ordered drinks and appetizers. While waiting for appetizers, they brought out baskets of bread (the pretzel bread was yummy!). We ordered Shrimp Cocktail and Seared Ahi Tuna for appetizers. I ate some of the tuna, which was amazing.

For main course, we each ordered a meat then a bunch of sides to share. I got the filet mignon. For sides, we got Mac & cheese, black truffle gnocchi, broccoli, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. I couldn't eat the gnocchi, but everything else was flavorful and delicious. Even the veggies had a unique flavor to them! We had leftovers, which we split up (somehow I ended up with a coworker's lamb, which I ate the next day and OH MY GOD I should have ordered lamb...). They bagged everything up for us and then we ordered desserts to share. We got the butter cake, flourless chocolate cake, and one other dessert (I forget!). The butter cake was good, but not my favorite. I loved the chocolate cake, though it was super rich. So yummy.

As far as service, our server was fantastic and attentive. When we first were seated and only ordered waters to start, I think he was a little \"eh\" that we might not be big spenders (and therefore big tippers...), but as we ordered more and more he seemed to friendly up a bit. He also had an assistant who helped quite a bit and constantly refilled our waters and cleared plates as needed. 

The ambiance is nice, but it is in a mall (though a pretty nice mall). The main seating areas kind of overlook the mall, so it's a bit \"meh\" but don't let that take away from your experience. The food was great, the service was great... the price was definitely expensive. I'm sure you can eat here without it being as pricey as we made it, but we ordered a LOT of food and drinks. 

Really enjoyed Mastro's. Definitely recommend it!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! It offers a wonderful dining atmosphere and the service was professional and polite. I ordered the lobster mashed potatoes, sauteed asparagus, raw oysters, and sea bass, and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Gr8 steak and seafood in this elegant and classy restaurant.  The wine list and bar menu are top shelf.  Desserts are other-worldly.  Service and ambience make me want to say \"shut up and just take my money.\"  Just as good as the one in Newport Beach sans the ocean view."}
{"text":"Outstanding seafood and service. Would definitely come back. It's in the Crystals shopping mall."}
{"text":"Mastro's in las Vegas is wonderful.  Ate there for ten year anniversary.  Service is wonderful.  Food is delicious.  Warm butter cake for dessert(on the house for special occasion) will make you jump back flips.  Lobster mash is incredible. Steaks were fab.  Waiter mike r, was great.  Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was very good. 
Blackened salmon and the Big Eye Tuna were terrific. Brussels sprouts were too large and undercooked. Mac and cheese was very good. Chopped salad as just average. 

Looking for a big Pinot Noir?  Belle Glos from
the Clark & Telephone vineyard will rock your world!"}
{"text":"This restaurant put two surprise charges on my bill. My wife and I came here for our 22nd anniversary.  When the meal was over they surprised us with a special anniversary cake. It was beautiful and a nice touch. Then we got the check they charged us $6 for this item, which we didn't order. The other surprise was a $5.88 \"surcharge,\" which a helpful footnote on the receipt explained as: \"Due to the rising costs of doing business in this location, including higher wage costs associated with higher minimum wage rates, a 3% surcharge has been added to your total bill.\"  OK, a total of $11.88 hidden fees on a bill just over $200 doesn't seem like much, but the underhandedness of it shows an inexcusable disrespect for the customer. McDonald's doesn't sneak in a surcharge to cover its minimum wage force--so why would someone charging more than $100 per person? And you're going to \"give\" us an anniversary cake and then ask us to pay for it without even pointing it out? Disgraceful!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the entire world! Its a hidden gem because its in a mall and less crowded than restaurants in casinos but dont let the crowd size fool you. Ive been there probably 20 times and ive never had a bad anything. Ive had everything on the menu because we often go to dinner with about 20 people so we order everything. Great wines, really fresh seafood, but the side dishes and desserts is what really sets them apart from others. My fav sides are brussels sprouts, scalloped potatoes, creamed corn, gorgonzola mac n cheese and mushrooms. For desserts nothing is better than the butter cake and pecan pie. If youre not a fan of raspberry sauce like myself you can order the butter cake without the raspberry and its heavenly! Its romantic enough for a date and trendy enough for dinner before going out with friends- like i said best restaurant in the entire world!"}
{"text":"First off let'a start out with the fact that we sat in the tree house!!!!! Great atmosphere and impeccable service not a second went by that our table was not being tended to refreshed or checked on to make sure everything was to our standards. From the Siberian caviar, west coast, and east coat oysters to the lobster and plentiful sides. Each bite was flavorful and delectable. The mouth watering lobster hardly needed anything added not even melted butter due to it melting already on your mouth from tenderness. The creamed spinach was packed full of flavor all the way down to the shuttle hint of garlic and don't forget the creamed corn. And you can't end your night without having the butter cake. Let's just say I died and went to heaven with each bite. Mouth watering melting you mouth warm butter cake topped with vanilla iced cream and fresh berries!! Need I even say more. Hands down fully impressed and satisfied."}
{"text":"Landed in Vegas and went on a mad hunt for a place to eat with the boyfriend. Wandered into Aria and found this swanky little place. Went to see if they had any tables open. About a 30 minute wait so we decided to do open seating at the bar. We ordered the mussels for appetizer, scallops for the main dish (for me) and steak for the mr. The mussels and the scallops were a little too salty for me, but the texture of the scallops was cooked perfectly. I also felt like I was eating the same thing with my main dish because the scallops came on slices of bread which was the same type of bread that was served to us for appetizer. The portion was quite generous though. The bf and I were trying to guess how many I'd get. I thought maybe 2 big pieces, and he thought maybe 3 moderately sized pieces. The dish came with 5 moderately sized pieces. The boyfriend's 12oz filet, however, was on a whole different level, and I couldn't stop eating his food. Juicy, tender, not overcooked (he got medium rare). It was the best steak the both of us have ever had. Seriously, TRY THE STEAK!"}
{"text":"Great experience. The service the food...wow . I can go on and on but you must experience it yourself. The steak, the Gouda mac and cheese, lobster mash...."}
{"text":"If you enjoy a good steak there is no better place than this.

I do consider myself a foodie and have dined at some of the best restaurants in North America and Ocean Club ( Scottsdale ) remains my favourite.

I have been dinning here for approximately 8 years now and they have never disappointed me. 

Some of my favourites are :
The filet mignon
The clear lobster roll
Lobster mashed potatoes 

The service 

The live music 

If you have been to any of Mastro's restaurants in other cities do not let that 
be your deciding factor. I have been to most and there is no other like Scottsdale.

I cannot say enough about this restaurant.
Absolutely the best steakhouse and sea food restaurant 

This is a true 5 star"}
{"text":"Located inside the upscale Shops at Crystal, Mastro's has an amazing wooden lattice structure that you can choose to dine in rather than inside. But hey we're here for the food right? 

The seafood here is top notch and as fresh as it gets. 

Everything from the amazing crab cakes, to the scallops, and outrageously fresh king crab legs were any seafood diners dream come true. The Chilean Sea Bass was perfectly cooked and super flaky and buttery.

Warm Butter Cake, their signature dessert, is worth saving room for. 

On top of that, service was one of the best I've ever had in any restaurant. Super attentive but not overly fawning - they were always there at the right time."}
{"text":"Excellent meal and service. I enjoyed the bone in filet that was so flavorful. Paired it with a bottle of Silveroak Cabernet."}
{"text":"The appetizing cuisine offerings at this restaurant were absolutely wonderful. Enjoyed a delectable steak, calamari , crab legs, and the strawberry shortcake brought out for my husband's birthday was to die for. Had a wonderful outing  catching up with friends and enjoyed the cuisine and exciting atmosphere. Service was great, was kind of surprised when asked if we all wanted butter on our steak ended up coating 60.00. Be aware of thia when asked, as it was not disclosed. Not a huge deal, but come on butter for 60.00,  really? Other than that, enjoyed our dinner, pleasant ambiance, and hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Maestro's several weeks ago on a Friday. Although we didn't have a reservation, we were seated fairly quickly and at a nice table. The service was spot on throughout our meal. My husband ordered the larger lobster and said it was amazing. Unfortunately my meal was deplorable. I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass. I've had this fish enough to know that I was served something else. Chilean Sea Bass is a white flakey fish. This was more like a tilapia at the Sea bass price. Furthermore it was under cooked. We ordered a side of Brussel Sprouts which were basically burnt.  I basically left my meal. I should have sent it back especially for the price. I would have given a lesser rating except for the exceptional service and my husband's lobster meal. We will not be back. I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service. Came back here twice on our Vegas visit! Will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"We came here just for the butter cake. It was heavenly. The cake was soft and crunchy, the ice cream was melting with the warm cake and was lovely. The whipped cream was fresh and had thick- butter like texture but was amazing. The only thing wrong with my visit was that Aria was testing the fire alarms. There was not sound, but the fire alarms were flashing. You couldn't notice the lights outside of mastros because the surrounding area was bright, but inside of mastros the lights were very dim and it was dark. The flashing lights stood out and gave me a headache. Other than that, the cake was great."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, don't miss the pretzel rolls & not that expensive for lunch."}
{"text":"Where to start, we have been here a couple of times now drinks and dinner and every time it just impresses me even more. My first introduction was on a friday night \"date night\"  with the hubby about two months ago we had already eatin dinner but wanted a night cap and we heard there was live music in the bar area, so we thought we would give it a try...We arrived about 9:30 pm and this place was packed!

So we looked around for a table to sit and saw one that was about to open and one of the girls that was working there welcomed us and said she would get that table set for us and she would be right over to get us started :)

With a couple of suggestions from Brittany K. our server we decided it would be a blueberry martini and a great glass of wine. Okay here is the greatest part the whole night, the bar is suddenly watching us when my drink arrives because this martini is served with dry ice in it and it is all misty and mysteroius and every one is like what is that.... my response is one of the best damm martini's and prersentation I have ever seen! So with that said this was the perfect way to end date night, great drinks, great service from brittany K, and oh yeah some great music from a live band... We loved it so much we have made it a point to go back and have dinner and of course for more cocktails...Dinner review below!

Okay so obvoiusly this place is renowned for its food and after having dinner I know why, from the start of our evening to the end of our dinner this place does not miss a beat and our server Chris Frazier like \"smokiing joe\" he said is a professional at what he does.

His suggestions for appetizers down to the main course to the heavenly butter cake at the end( which is to die for) were spot on....

We started with the shrimp cocktail and the presentataion and taste of this south of the border creation was truly the best we have had. For dinner my husband of course did the filet, like he always does when we go ut for dinner and I decided on the Vanilla Battered Twin Lobster Tails...OMG these must of been the biggest tails I have ever seen, and they were amazing...Oh yeah the hubby said his filet was one of the bttere ones he has had which is saying a lot because he has had a ton of filets in his life, like I said that is all he ever orders :)

So we couldn't make up our mind of whether or not to have dessert but Chris our server said they have this butter cake dessert that will make you want to come back in just for that, and he was not kidding this is truely something every one should mark of their bucket list..AMAZING

Either way way we have been back in for cocktails and yes the butter cake and every time has been great...this place is on our radar and in our regular rotaion, what took us so long to go here, is the only question I keep asking myself?
 
So kudos to the staff at Ocean's Club and especially Chris and Brittany who we have seen again and to the Manger Frank who has come by and welcomed us back, you all do a fantastic Job...We will so you soon!"}
{"text":"I died, went heavenward, then came back and ate more butter cake & its accompanying cloud of fresh whipped cream. This place is exceptional. Clean, chilled Belvedere martini. Spicy Mambo salad (chilled chopped romaine hearts with grated parmesan; a horseradishy/wasabied Caesar of sorts) to start & bone-in 22 oz ribeye for my beauhunk & seabass for me. Ambiance is stellar. A terrific experience from start to finish. Thank you Mastro's!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food - esp the bone marrow dish.

I want to give them a five but they didn't not earn it due to service.

It is a good place but the service was a bit \"elite\" feeling.  I felt they could have accommodated our party better than they did.

Good however is excellent."}
{"text":"The scene:   Viagra central.  Aging men with hair plugs and untucked dress shirts sipping house merlot.  Nieces and third wives clinging to hope.  Lurkers awaiting a free bar stool.

The food at Mastro's is actually pretty good.  Steak is excellent.  Side dishes of vegetables are well portioned and good.  Wine list is over priced.  Great bread service.   Very attentive service.  

However, on a Friday the bar area is a cesspool of Alpha-males and their prey.  It is a bizarre scene.  Maybe that's why we went in the first place."}
{"text":"The food here is pricey, but well worth it. The sides are served family style so you may only need two or three for the whole table. The steaks are perfectly cooked and the cuts of meat are the best of quality.

This particular location offers a cool area to sit in if you are fortunate enough to be seated there. It is a pod-like structure that is in the middle of the hotel atrium. It feels very cool and adds to the experience.

If you are looking to go big, this is a great place to do it!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best meal we have ever had. Ahi Tuna Tostada was flawless. Also had the Sea Bass and Alaskan Halibut. Oysters Rockefeller came out with a strange smell but I think it was the shells on the 400 degree salt. Once it cooled off smell went away and the oysters were as fresh as I have ever enjoyed. Outstanding Restaurant."}
{"text":"Our most recent dining experience at Mastros was 3/29/15. We were a party of 4. We were seated promptly upon arrival under \"the cage\". That is an open covering cavelike to soften the views of the Mall as it is located in the Crystal Mall in City Center. Crazy. Most of us ordered steaks and Calamari for an appetizer. The appetizer took FOREVER to appear! Ok, forgiven because it was excellent. Moving on. The steaks, for the most part, were fine except for one which needed less raw. Yes, I said raw! All side dishes are a la carte, so sharing is a must. The dinners are served on near bare plates with no presentation at all, so whatever. 
All in all, not bad, but for the price a little bit more effort is in order. I will say our server did her best to cover up the mis-steps and I appreciate that effort. Unfortunately, she should not have to."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our anniversary dinner here recently and the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think it's too high for what you receive.  Yes, it's in the Kierland area alongside Dominicks, Mortons Eddy V's, etc., but overall I think it's high for seafood.  We have enjoyed all of the other Maestro steak houses but hadn't yet tried Ocean Club. We were there on a Monday night and it was still a busy place for a weekday.  Bar  area is gorgeous, and they have live music every night of the week.  We sat at a table in the bar so we could listen to the music and it was not too loud so that we could still talk and enjoy ourselves.  Service was stellar, Nick was our waiter and he did a great job. The menu is seafood primarlly and steaks which are prepared the same at any of the Maestro properties (City Hall and Mastro's Steakhouse)..The seabass was outstanding and hubby had the ahi tuna...we shared a salad and lobster mashed potatoe as a side (everything is big enough to share) and a great bottle of wine...Butter cake is to die for so don't miss that."}
{"text":"Amazing all around! Food was extraordinary and the staff was friendly.

Had an issue with our leftovers getting lost, so they made us a whole new meal to take home and were extremely apologetic."}
{"text":"5 star class all the way. Not only was the food amazing and the design of the restaurant but service was superb too. All portions were very big. My lamb was to die for. Ambiance out of this world. I normally do not eat bread but I just had to here."}
{"text":"We went for dinner last night and the food and service was excellent. Would definatly reccomend. They went overboard for our special occasion. Great dinner."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  Even the bread basket was delicious!  I was wary of eating at a restaurant in the middle of a mall, no matter how fascinating it looks.  But everything was delicious!  I ordered a Lemon Drop, and they put a little dry ice on the bottom of the glass and serve it table side.  The drink starts to bubble and smoke.  It tasted refreshingly yummy!  There were 4 of us.  We ordered The Lobster Bisque, Mussels, Tuna Tartar, and a Cesar salad for appz.  OMG.  Delicious!  As another reviewer pointed out, if you order a main dish, like the Sea Bass, it will come all by itself on a plate.  So order some side dishes.  The waiter will plate it up for you at your table.  We were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert.  Bummer, because I'm sure it would have been yummy.  Our bill was around $475 with tip.  So not too bad with all that we had, including cocktails and wine."}
{"text":"We love it here.  Food is amazing and the service is some of the best we've experienced.  Both times that we've been here the ambiance was enhanced with live music - which was great.  My only complaint is that it's a 'place to be seen' in the bar area - so it's tough to grab a drink and chat before dinner because it is SO crowded.  If you want a popular place to meet singles or go for a 'night out', hit the bar here.  We usually stick to the restaurant area and we love the food and service.  Just be prepared for the party crowd in the bar!"}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place 5 stars because the food was very good and it is in a convenient location.  I would definitely recommend coming here, but our party made reservations well in advance and we still had to wait over an hour for our table to open up.  We weren't apologized to and everything seemed a bit frantic. Our party had an eventful day in Vegas, so we had a lot to talk about in our extended wait, but it still shouldn't happen to people that made reservations. Upside: BUTTER CAKE"}
{"text":"Kind of seems like corporate poaching or corporate synergy that fuels this establishment next to the large Westin Kierland corporate hotel.  The experience kind of feels like a sales push where each separate item is a separate cost, and each customization is extra, and the message conveyed by the staff is hard to follow, because it's loud and they go quick assuming you know the options and don't care about the cost!! 

The pace was good and service good enough, and I'm optimistic I can upgrade to 4 starts after trying this place again with some experience with this kind of corporate steakhouse under my belt.

Bread and lobster gnocchi were hits. Sea bass was okay but with other strong flavors on the table i couldn't appreciate it. Maybe it's better if you cover it in cheese or something with the added customization.."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and we always request a professional, personable server by the name of Shawn Feeny.  He is a great guy that makes the experience all that better.  Highly recommend this establishment.  Their Filet and Crab legs are wonderful and cooked to perfection.  The ambiance gives a sense of relaxation, yet it is a fine dining restaurant which I find appealing."}
{"text":"Was here exactly one week ago with a group- about 10 of us, girls and guys (what was left over from a combined bachelor/bachelorette weekend). My husband and I are from Chicago and the Mastros here is my FAVORITE restaurant in the world (see review)- so I came to this one with really high expectations. First off our server, Tim, was phenomenal! So friendly, quick, and informative with every question we had. Next was the food, which was just as I expected- amazing. Husband had the bone in filet, and I did the halibut. Both delicious! I tried my girlfriends sea bass and that was awesome too. We all split a ton of apps and sides, and finished off with butter cakes for the table. Food coma heaven! 
The only thing lacking was the atmosphere. (Why I knocked off 1 star) we were expecting a loud, energetic \"Vegas\" style restaurant (much like the one back home here in Chicago) But it was very quiet, bright, and just low energy. More suitable for a quiet dinner with your significant other, not a crazy group of 8 guys and 2 girls lol. But hey maybe that's the feel this Mastros is going for, which I can totally appreciate."}
{"text":"Perfect first experience at Mastro's! Went there to celebrate our anniversary and they really did make it feel like a special occasion. We were seated in the treehouse - beautiful and romantic, great date spot. 
Really unique cocktail list -definitely not the usual boring drinks. I tried the blueberry martini, didn't really care for the taste since I prefer sweet drinks, but it was strong and something different. Cocktails were a little pricey at about $18 each, but you pay for the ambiance. 
Started w escargot, I've never had it served in the shell before. Very pretty and delish - served w clarified butter and garlic. Great selection of yummy breads too. 
We shared the 18oz bone in Kansas city strip w twin lobster tails (1 butter poached, 1 vanilla tempura fried). Sides - twice baked potato and brussel sprouts w bacon. Steak was cooked perfectly medium, tender, juicy and flavorful. They knew we were sharing so everything was split for us. Poached lobster was good, cooked perfectly. The tempura lobster... mmm I'm not a huge fan. It was good, but a LOT of batter and I didn't really get even a hint of vanilla. Glad we decided to try it both ways. 
Twice baked potato was good, but I've had better. They didn't bring it out till about 10min after the rest of the food because the chef didn't like how the first one looked, so he made a new one. They took it off the bill w out us asking. Nice that the chef has attn to detail vs just cranking out the orders. Brussel sprouts used to be fried w pancetta but they recently changed the menu, so no more pancetta. They did accommodate by doing it w bacon instead, but not really the same - thin sliced bacon just can't compare to chunks of pancetta.
We got the butter cake comp since it was an anniversary. Super cute of them to do a candle. The cake is enough for 3 or 4 to share, served w vanilla ice cream and a huge bowl of fresh whipped cream. So bad, but soooo good! 
Service was excellent, our server Mike was friendly and knowledgeable. The rest of the wait staff were great too. I checked out our neighbors food, I'm looking forward to trying the seabass, seared tuna, or crab salad next time. 
In the end there's not a huge difference w steak joints - they generally serve the same cuts, appetizers and sides. But Mastro's stands apart with its service and intimate classy ambiance."}
{"text":"The overall design is impressive.  It was busy on a Friday night, and the staff was very attentive.  They are busting their ass all night long.  We had the seafood tower which was good.  The horseradish sauce that came with it was tasty.  I had the pan seared Chilean sea bass which was divine.  Every bite melted in my mouth like butter.  The seasoning was perfect.  The lobster mash was good, but the lobster was over cooked and a bit rubbery.  Overall It was good."}
{"text":"I came here with a part of 7 this evening. The service is excellent the food is great lots if attention to detail how everything is delivered in a timely manner. Our waiter was excellent and took good care of my table. Keep on going guys. I sure to come back soon. Cheers"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal.

Breathtaking when you walk in... just like then 1st time i walked in to XS the nightclub. Absolutely breathtaking.

I had the bone in filet mignon. It was cooked perfectly!!! but honestly it really needs sauce. not the type of steak you can eat by itself. maybe next time ill try ribeye. But with sauce its good.

SEAFOOD TOWER WAS INCREDIBLE!!!! Lobster Cocktail & Oysters were great. They use blue point oysters.

Lobster Mash was good.

For Dessert, the CHOCOLATE PUDDING CAKE WAS THE BEST!!!! Very similar to a Chocolate Lava Cake. Outstanding.

I love this place. Its so beautiful and it really represents living the good life!!! 

Service is great. They have like 5 people waiting on your table, bread person, server, drink person. everything. Great great service.

Seating was quick. Probably because City Center is new. I am enjoying it though & i am not looking forward to when this place gets packed. LOVE IT!!! GOTTA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXCLUSIVITY WHILE IT LASTS!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Keep in mind this is the first steakhouse I've ever been to that was more than $50 per person so I'm easily impressed.
Off the bat I felt out of place in my \"los pollos hermanos\" graphic t-shirt, basketball shorts, and flip flops, but they made me feel welcome anyways.
The service was nuts, by the time I entered and had my plate of food, I was probably introduced to like 8 different people, all of them friendly and accomodating. They work super fast and efficient too, the lady swooped around behind me and refilled my water without me even noticing. When they brought out our food, they had a person for each plate, and put it all on our table within a few seconds. I was like daaaayuuummm sooonnnn. food was great too."}
{"text":"We had some wine, a cocktail, Escargot, Shrimp Sushi, NY steak with truffle butter,  Mushrooms and Casserole potatoes.  We did have 2 cups of coffee at the end as well.  Bill was $227 and $45 tip.  Was well worth it.  One of the best dinners we have had in a long time.  The service was beyond, over the top, amazing; just friendly as hell.  The atmosphere is nice, not the nicest, but it is an upper-class mall.

Our Server was Matt, we do not remember the chef that night."}
{"text":"It's tough to find a more elegant place with better food than this. From the incredible service and attention to detail to the wonderful selection of meats and seafood.

We started with several appetizers, all that were amazing. The steak I ordered was prepared to perfection and the sides were impecable. The lamb dish was the best I have ever eaten and everything was perfect. It's hard to leave room for desert but you absolutely have to because the deserts are as incredible as the meals."}
{"text":"Great place for excellent steaks and seafood. Similar to Capital Grille Flemings or Ruth Chris. Excellent quality food service drinks and atmosphere. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where their high ratings come from. At the price they sell main courses ($35-$60) which includes no sides at all but just a piece of fish or meat is ridiculous as even then it's just a piece of meat - no interesting garnish or sauce even on the plate. 

The quality of the fish was ok but we too don't live on the coast and the fish at our local Whole Foods is as good or better than here. Also their beef was just that - ok but I know our local store sells as high of quality. 

Was pissed that this place charged $20 for an heirloom tomato salad and served it with the tomatoes cold as if straight from a fridge. Who the hell does that? The tomatoes should be stored at room temperature anyway and I certainly don't want a cold tomato salad. Weak and almost embarrassing for the restaurant. 

The vegetable sides are about as generic as you can get and available almost anywhere. Brussels sprouts, green beans, garlic mashed potatoes -  not interesting nor were they very good. 

Not sure if their high ratings come from people that live way outside a major city or maybe in live the middle of the country where chain restaurants are the only option but this place was downright shameful for the price and for the generic food preparation. Almost like they have no head chef running things but just an expediter slinging out the same old stuff every day and never thinking to change or improve things. 

Bill was around $120/person. No problem if it was an amazing meal (or even above average) but again I could've cooked it better at home for 1/3 the price. 

I guess this restaurant will keep cashing in on people don't who know any better or want the most simple uninspiring food on the planet."}
{"text":"Wow!!  Ashley and Mario were the best!!  They took very good care of us on my wife's birthday. It was a great evening!!  Not for those who are not up for spending a ridiculous amount of money for one meal. ... but Ashley and Mario made it worth it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in las vegas..the staff is perfect and managers are the best"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food prep as expected from this top shelf eatery. Best Steaks and Seafood. Extensive wine list."}
{"text":"Hubby took me here for velentines day. Must say, he got a big wet kiss for picking this place. Very fancy & romantic with it's dim lighting. We sat by the piano bar where a live band was playing that evening. Made me reminisce of restaurants in NYC. Service was top notch, even on a busy evening. Great wine selection. We decided on a bottle of Cabernet which was excellent! Sorry, forgot the name. Hubby had rib eye steak while I had the Chilean Seabass. We shared two sides of gorgonzola Mac n Cheese and wasabi mashed potatoes. I was expecting a dime size meal but I was mistaken. Portions are very reasonable! I am not a meat neater but holy mother of god...that steak was ammmaazziing! Perfectly cooked medium rare and it just felt so good in my mouth! So tender and well seasoned. My seabass was also good but I prefer Eddie Vs version. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this. Tasty & just kinda melted in my mouth like butter. However, the sides didn't do too much for me. Too much melted cheese on top. All I got was a big chunk of cheese with every bite which tastes like rubber band especially when it cools down. I was also expecting to taste some wasabi in the mashed potato but didn't taste a hint of it whatsoever. Regardless, we had a great experience & would definitely come back to try the other dishes this fine restaurant has to offer."}
{"text":"Place is busy as hell but they set us up at the bar and the service was unreal.  They did not miss a step.   
Unfortunately we ordered a 3 pound lobster  tail and it came out like cooked leather, but without question they replaced it with 2 smaller but perfect tails.  Thanks for a good birthday dinner.
Some restaurants get it, make the customer happy with no excuses. We will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Open past 10pm for late dinner.
I was in Las Vegas for my birthday weekend and my friend and I were looking for a nice dinner at 10pm. It is hard to find a steakhouse open past 10pm but we found Mastro's and I am so thankful. 

We started with the lobster cocktail and it is huge. The lobster claws went past my expectations. And mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts with our 22 oz ribeye. 

The only bad thing is the location, it is right in the mall which I am not a fan of, but it is conveniently located on the strip. And the architecture is beautiful and modern."}
{"text":"My favorite place to dine in Las Vegas!

(1) Service - I forgot his name but awesome, awesome server! Best service ever. He was hot too! Drools! 5 stars for amazing service and seating me with a hot server.

(2) Seafood Tower - massive shrimp, king crab, lobster, three types of oysters, and massive mouth jizzy. 

(3) Bone-In Ribeye - mouth jizz... must get! 5 stars

(4) Lobster Mash Potato - one of my favorite dishes. Drenched in BUTTER... yum! 5 stars

(5) Asparagus - well cooked! 5 stars!

(6) Bone Marrow - 5 stars!

(7) Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi - 5 stars

(8) Birthday Chocolate Cake - I got this for free... so sweet of them... but it wasn't my birthday... I think they gave it to the wrong person.

(9) Coffee - a little weak... I wanted a strong one... so I can get ready for the clubbb... yeahhhhh... woots!

OVERALL** Yup! That was all for 2 people... haha! I eat a lot! Massive bill... but worth every of my penny!"}
{"text":"Little late on this review, but didn't want to miss out on saying how wonderful this beautiful new restaurant is. Service was impeccable. Seafood tower was delicious and our steaks were perfectly prepared. Not a sea bass eater, but was told it was one of the tastiest. A don't miss Vegas experience."}
{"text":"Dined here for my boyfriend's birthday on 7/9 and I have to say, this was the best experience ever! I was able to make a last minute reservation for the night of, as we were vacationing in Vegas for the weekend. We were escorted to our table right upon our arrival. The wait staff was awesome! For drinks, I ordered the Lemon Drop Martini which is served over dried ice; he ordered a Strawberry Pina Colada (which isnt on the menu but they made something to match his desire) For dinner, My baby ordered the 22oz rib eye, I ordered the swordfish with a side of lobster mashed potatoes. We cleaned our plates, and couldn't take anymore. However, we did! The birthday dessert was better than anything we have ever tasted... We would definitely dine her again! A beyond amazing experience..."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this restaurant after a friend highly recommended to us. My first impression is service was top notch. Our waiter was friendly, and informative on the dishes. Throughout the night, the waiter constantly address our needs without having to ask. We ultimately decide on the sea bass, lobster mash potatoes, rib eyes bone in,  scallops, brussel sprouts with bacon and butter cake. 

Lobster mash 5/5 - must have if you are fan of mash potatoes. The taste and texture of the dish is perfection. 

Sea bass 3.5/5 - The sea bass was pan seared crispy on the outside, but it was also lacking little seasoning. The dish was a bit disappointing to me due to a lot reviews saying so much great things about it. 

Scallops 5/5 - The scallops was my favorite dish of the night. Very much like how the sea bass was cook, and 

Brussel sprouts with bacon 3.5/5 - they cooked the brussel just the way I like it. It was crispy in the outside and soft in the side. There was a few piece that was burn and left a bitter taste, but the one that isn't taste very well. 

Bone in ryebye 4/5- the streak was delicious , but it wasn't anything speical.


The overall quality and service was amazing. At the end of the night I was highly satisfied!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to have a steak and we decided to try Mastro. This was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Their fried calamari had a perfect touch of spices and was amazing. You do not even need a dip for it."}
{"text":"Great food and great ambiance. Love this mastro's location. Have tried the ones in Malibu and LA and this location definitely is consistent with the brand."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday with 4 ladies this evening. It has been my experience at other restaurants that waiters do their best to ignore serving women because they expect a lousy gratuity. Not here; the service was excellent by Robert and our food delicious. Our steaks arrived perfectly cooked, hot and juicy.  The butter cake is not to be missed! In the last couple of months I have eaten at Maestro's Beverly Hills, Palm Springs and now Las Vegas. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I had been to the cougar den a/k/a the bar at this location before, but never dined in the restaurant, so the bf and decided to check it out, as City Hall is one my favorite restaurants.  Our reservation was at 7:45pm on a Friday, we were finally seated around 8:30.  They were clearly running behind schedule.  However, it was a nice touch that they offered all the waiting guests a glass of champs.  Classy move!  

We were seated next to a big table and they were SUPER loud, so if you're in the mood for a quiet and romantic evening, be sure to request a table away from the bar area and not right next to larger tables.  The bf and I get excited when we see lobster bisque and clam chowder on menus, so I started with the clam chowder and he had the lobster bisque.  Surprisingly, considering this is a seafood restaurant and the high price point, they were both just okay.  Not bad, but definitely not the best we've had.  For our entrées, I had the scallops and the bf had the swordfish Oscar style.  Both were really good!  The scallops were large and plump.  Although the sauce they were in was good, I almost felt like it was a little too heavy for the scallops.  Maybe I'm just a purist -- I like my scallops sautéed in butter and garlic.  But the dish was still good.  We also had the sautéed spinach and lobster mashed potatoes as sides.  The lobster mashed potatoes is a favorite of ours from City Hall, and even at $35, they're worth it!  Large chunks of lobster and puddles of butter -- it doesn't get much better than that.  We would have normally finished off with the butter rum cake, another of our favorites from City Hall, but we were so stuffed that we couldn't eat anything else.

Our server, who was awesome all evening, brought our check and informed us they had comp'd my glass of wine and then taken off an extra $20 because we had to wait so long.  So that was $40 off our bill -- awesome!  Another classy move!  And to top it off, I received a voicemail from the hostess the following morning following up on our experience!  I originally would have put this review in the 3.5 star category, but the service is so outstanding that it is definitely worthy of 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Although it is called Mastro's OCEAN Club, I actually think that one may be better off getting Steak here.  I had the Sea Bass and felt as though it was pretty dry and maybe over cooked.  The appetizers / sides were all good, but the highlight for me was the dessert.  I had the vanilla cake, and it was outrageously good.  It was like a chocolate lava cake, but vanilla.  I never had anything like that before, and it was great.  If the main dish was better, Mastro's would be a 4 star meal.

The prices were what one would expect.  By no means is it a cheap meal, but it was \"A-OK\" (for the price).  This has to be rated based on cost / enjoyment."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was excellent! They ran out of the steak my husband wanted and the manager came to our table and gave him a bigger steak no extra charge. Very nice man. Our server was also super friendly. Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"I'm not typically one to write reviews but I was so blown away by my dining experience here, I felt compelled to share. I will start by saying the service was truly over the top. We were seated immediately upon arrival and we never waited for anything. Our server, Elizabeth, greeted us promptly, explained the menu, and brought our drinks and a warm bread basket. In addition, there were many other \"wait staff\" assisting all of the tables. The minute our glasses were empty, someone was right there ready to fill it. In all of my years of fine dining, I've never experienced service quite like this...not to mention, it was prime time on a Friday evening so it's not like they weren't busy.

Now, aside from the top-notch service, the food was out of this world! The jumbo sautéed sea scallops were cooked to perfection, with a delicious garlic sauce. The filet mignon was so tender, it just melted in your mouth. I've been craving it ever since we left! We thought we were full but when that warm butter cake came out....O-M-G. Best dessert I've ever eaten in my life! All I can say is, it's a good thing we ate here on our last night because I would have wanted to go back a few times! I researched the other locations and found one in NYC. I'll be going there in March and I'm looking forward to another fantastic meal!

I highly recommend this restaurant. I would give it 10 stars if I could...and a special thank you to our server, Elizabeth, for making this such a memorable dining experience"}
{"text":"At the hostess stand they have a sign that reads 3% surcharge will be added to every guest charge due to the raise of minimum wage.  This place charges $87 for a lobster tail and $13 for a side of fries.  They should be grateful for their employees and their hard work and they can afford to pay them more then minimum wage without asking for it from the customers.  I don't respect any place that pays their salt and vinegar French fries more than their employees, I don't care how good the food is."}
{"text":"MY ALL TIME FAVORITE RESTAURANT ON THE STRIP!  I bring my parents every year for their birthday & I go on my birthday as well!  The food is PHENOMENAL  & the service is even better!  The dungeness Crab Cocktail is AMAZING!  Oh & their Chilean Sea Bass is literally the BEST I've EVER had....if you get it pan seared, it literally just MELTS in your mouth!  Oh & their warm butter cake....simply to DIE for!"}
{"text":"It was back to Mastro's in The Nest to dine well before seeing Cher, and once again complimentary Pretzel Bread was of the highest quality, and Vanilla Battered Shrimp with tangy Cocktail Sauce and mild Mustard Sauce offered a fine, unusual start to a memorable meal.  Silky Boston Clam Chowder with celery, clams, and potato chunks was tasty if a little peppery.  And a Warm Spinach Salad with a lot of egg, bacon, Red Onions, & Bleu Cheese Crumbles was quite large and very good.

My 6 oz. Prime Grade Filet Mignon was perfectly medium rare as ordered; the Bearnaise Sauce that went with it was just as outstanding as before; and warm pre-cracked king Crab Legs dipped in Drawn Butter were a perfect counterpoint to the beef.  My 1 lb. Baker with butter, chives & bacon was too big for me to handle, but I enjoyed what I ate.  And Warm Butter Cake with the texture of Carrot Cake a la mode beautifully topped off a meal that met high expectations.

Service was exemplary, with water and Iced Tea glasses regularly filled and refreshed, and crumbs whisked off our table, as a matter of course.  But I was a bit startled to encounter a bathroom attendant in the restroom upstairs who pours soap on your hand, and awaits a tip in a tip jar, which brought back echoes of classic Vegas of yesteryear."}
{"text":"Wow.  Our server Robert, wow.  AMAZING experience.  We got there late at 6:15pm and had a show starting at 7:30pm.  That essentially leaves an hour.  Despite the busy night, despite me being all over the place in hurry to get in and out, he did an exceptional job!  

Best steak ever!!  Prepared perfectly, on the warmest (okay, hottest) plate for an additional temp if needed.  The Lobster Mashers are totally worth the $39!  But the Butter Cake, I could live off that!  

Great experience!  You must ask to be sat in the \"treehouse\", but don't beg like me... Hahah."}
{"text":"I've only been to one steakhouse before this and I wasn't too impressed, but I decided to give this place a shot since our friends were really excited for some fine dining in Vegas. 

Our group of eight was seated at a round table underneath the massive open-air structure. 

The lobster mashed potatoes were so buttery and delicious. This was a table favorite and it was devoured in minutes. I honestly think the garlic mashed potatoes would have probably tasted just as good and would have been much cheaper. 

The 22oz bone-in ribeye was enormous. My friends and I were joking how maybe half the steak would just be bone, but it turns out we were sorely wrong .The bone was maybe 4-5 ounces and the rest of it was delicious, flavorful meat. I opted for medium rare, my friend opted for rare, and I think most of the table preferred the medium rare since it had more flavor although the rare meat was more tender. It really depends on your steak preferences.

The dessert was butter cake. The first couple bites I thought were way to sweet, but that's why it came with a side of heavy whip cream. Top the dessert with the whip cream and it really tones down the sweetness.

The things that stood out the most was the ambiance and quality of food."}
{"text":"This restaurant in a tree house was an all around great experience. The service from start to finish was top notch, our food was so good, table side prep and presentation was perfect. A true fine dining experience. Most important thing was the home made whipped cream! If it's winter time have a hot chocolate with this whip cream on it if it's summer put it on anything and everything. We ate it by itself!!!!"}
{"text":"LOUD! We were first seated in the dining room right next to the piano/singer in the bar. I had to ask twice to be moved to somewhere more quiet because I could not be heard over the singer. Fortunately we were seated shortly away from the bar, but the noise level was still very high. I would not return no matter how good the food just because of the noise level.

The food. We split a Caesar salad, which was OK but too salty and over dressed. We had to ask for some bread. My wife loved her scallops. My swordfish was very thick and looked delicious. It, however, was a little over cooked, and fairly bland. It did not have that grilled flavor I love on fish. The waiter recommended the lobster mashed potatoes ($38), so we got that and the green beans with slivered almonds. If you do not absolutely love lobster, take the $10 baked potato instead. I do not like my veggies over cooked, but the beans were way under done. After dinner decaf coffee was just OK and served in a large cup, but we not offer a refill until we were ready to leave. Key Lime Pie was a large slice, but I've had much better."}
{"text":"Simply bad service from the waitress Christina. Ignored and didnt offer a second drink to us thus loosing value to the owners. Second time meeting her and not a fan. Local resident at Crystals."}
{"text":"I went for dinner in 2/15 for anniversary.  Wow this has been the best dinner I have ever had.  Expensive yes.  It's a lot even for Vegas.   It's worth it though for special occasions.  My wife (the boss) still talks about are dinner."}
{"text":"All things aside this place is expensive but worth every penny.. Only thing that matters is save room for the butter cake.. Don't screw it up! Always save room for the butter cake..."}
{"text":"warm butter cake!

it is warm
and full of butter
and oh so sweet.

what more can i say?

thank you to the hostess for seating us without a reservation.  if you are just coming for the dessert let the hostess know so that they don't turn you away"}
{"text":"Came here for me wedding anniversary 6/14/2018 for the first time and the food was amazing as well as the service, best steak , lobster bisque and lobster mashed potatoes i ever had !!!! I'll definitely be back !!! 10 stars (didn't get a picture of the food) but the cake melted in my mouth omg"}
{"text":"Yes I know I am the only person on here to give them 3 stars but please hear me out for my reasoning behind all this. 

On Saturday, I had made reservations for a party of two at 730PM. When he arrived at 720PM, it was not really busy nor was it a ghost town in there. The hostess stand said it would be a moment as they got our table ready and for us to take a seat at the bar, enjoy a cocktail or two and they will get us. 

During our 30 minute wait (yes maybe they were short staffed, not ready yet etc.... which I am ok with) they sat multiple tables of walk-in's and a few reservations of small 2-4 tops. (I know this because a few sat at the bar whom we spoke to and others I over heard when I stood by the hostess stand to wait to check on my table. Off to a bad start..... 

Anyway, we had a nice table overlooking the garden down stairs in the back of the restaurant. All the back-waiters were very prompt and professional with regards to keeping the water glasses full, serving the bread, clearing the table from the right and serving from the left etc... (After working in this industry for years, I get picky about this crap at high end restaurants) The server was pretty on the ball and friendly but a little to relaxed with us. (Yes we are young and eating at a high end restaurant, I am ok with that)

On to the food, below is a list of what we ordered and what I thought about it: 

Calamari App: Lightly breaded with light seasoning. Dipping sauce complimented it very well. 

Fillet Mignon: Very tender and medium rare is more of rare. But it is better to under cook the steak then burn the hell out of it. VERY TENDER, cut with your fork status. 

Sea Bass: Parmesan crusted.... a little on the very fishy side for my taste which overcame the rest of the flavors

Cream of Spinach: Very creamy and just was not my style. Girlfriend liked it though.

Sea salt/vinegar fries: These shoestring cut fries were epic! Yes.... of everything I ate, I was most impressed by the large basket of $10 fries. 

Warm Butter Cake: Once again.... this was the main reason we went here for my birthday and because the other half loves this dessert more than she loves me. :)

Multiple layer chocolate birthday cake: Now to be honest, this was what saved Mastro's from getting the dreadful 2-star rating from me. In my reservation, I had noted \"birthday\" but no one had seemed to see it. Hell, we even ordered desert and were half way finished with it before they brought out the cake. Personally, did someone at the hostess stand go oops! We need to send a birthday cake over to Table XX immediately even though they already are half way through their dessert? But to be honest, they did and it truly made my otherwise mediocre dining experience in to a pleasant one. 

Overall Mastros.... maybe I set my expectations to high and I understand, you have only been open for a few months now so maybe all the bugs are still getting worked out. In the words of my girlfriend, it was not as good as the Crystal Cove, CA location yet on par with the one in Costa Mesa, CA. 

Sounds like I have to try all this again at the Crystal Cove location and compare! Granted.... thanks for the last minute birthday cake. It was nice to see those little comments on Open Table actually mean something."}
{"text":"I'll just get right to it:

I love their steak. They serve some of the best steak I've ever had. Not exactly my favorite, but it's up there! The sides are just as good. We had creamed corn and garlic mashed potatoes. For appetizer we had oysters.
Service was great! No reservation needed and no waiting. 

Oh, and get the warm butter cake!"}
{"text":"Over the top dining experience the food was amazing I ordered the Chilean sea bass with sauteed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes also was surprised with a wonderful dessert with a candle on it for my birthday truly an amazing evening. As I say quality is remembered long after price forgotten."}
{"text":"Super disappointed tonight to not eat here.  Had reservations at 8:15 and they were backed up - told us it would be 15-20 minutes.  Checked back a couple of times and the hostess was a bit aloof.  I assume it was because there were numerous people waiting for their reservations.  Checked back at 8:45 to be told that best case was another 20 minutes....not sure the point in reservations if you don't get to keep them.  Sure the food is good but we left to find something else."}
{"text":"Mastros ocean club Las Vegas really hit it out of the park. Dinning is an experience compiled of food, service and ambiance for me. So when one is missing or lacking it affects the whole experience. Mastros has it all down to a near perfection. Our server was incredible, attentive and funny. The restaurant was beautifully organized and last but not least the food, I have to say, is the best I've had at any mastros. The seafood tower, tomahawk, gnocchi definitely stood out for me and, OF COURSE, the buttercake. What a wonderful experience will for sure return to this location on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Mastros at home so we decided to check out the Las Vegas location. Sadly we were very disappointed. My steak was burnt on the outside but medium rare on the inside. (I ordered medium so I didn't return it) My husband order medium well and it was bleeding all over his plate! The waiter took his three pieces of steak back where it was cooked dry. The brussel sprouts had no flavor and were just dry. I gave two stars because the waiter kept my water glass full. For a $200 meal I expect my food to be cooked properly. I've included a picture of my burnt steak."}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago for my mother-in-law's birthday and everything was delicious! I had the scallops and the sauce was amazing! Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was amazing! Great restaurant for special occasions."}
{"text":"It looks like it's all been said before, so I'll keep this short (as much as I can manage) and sweet.  

Impressive digs: the sculptural treehouse dining room is a gem.  The bar is impressive (a two story shelf of bottles).  

The service is absolutely top notch: when we arrived for our 8:30 pm reservations, the hosts apologized but there was going to be a twenty minute delay.  We weren't bothered at all by the wait, but we were still given glasses of complimentary champagne--and we were treated to the restaurant's signature Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  I have absolutely no complaints about the delay in getting seated.  Mastro's handled a difficult situation appropriately, and in my opinion, went above and beyond for myself and the other guests that were also seated late.

My boyfriend and I went all out for dinner and ordered the seared ahi appetizer as well as the Hamachi with Fried Onions.  Please, oh please make sure you get this.  I've never seen anything like it before.  The perfectly fried onions melt on your tongue like butter, and the hamachi was perfect.  What an amazing combination.

We ordered the Bone-In 12 Oz Filet and the 22 Oz Rack of Lamb with a side of Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese and Roasted Brussels Sprouts. 

The proteins were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious, but the stand out dish on the table was the flippin' amazing Mac & Cheese.  We talked about it at the restaurant, as we were leaving the restaurant, while we were next door at the Aria casino, on our flight home, and ever since we've been back home.  They are out of this world.  We were so sad that we weren't able to take home the leftovers.

Dessert: what hasn't been said about the Warm Butter Cake already?  Just get it already.

This place is spendy--and totally worth every penny."}
{"text":"Way long overdue review of this fine establishment. Fine dining at its best. Hubby and I had our honeymoon last year from here. We enjoyed every moment of our visit.

The food and service is amaze balls. If you are a steak lover like I'am. Then this place is for you. It's super ultra expensive. I had my New York Strip steak for $57.00 alone. Yes alone meaning you have to order sides for extra cost. But mind you! You are getting the very best in high quality meat. So expect to pay that much. 

The sides comes out in family style in small platters. So you can take out what amount you want. 

The wait staff pays attention to detail about you're visit. The waiters aren't overbearing. Always ask to be seated in the birds nest for an amazing experience. The architecture of the birds nest is truly magical. 

Five stars all around. 

Go get you're steak now."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of the Ocean Club since it opened, and I always make an effort to dine here when I'm on the Strip. 

Top notch in every way: service, decor, ambiance, wine list, and happily- the FOOD! 

Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is an example of 5 starts restaurant. Great service, classy environment and hosts, amazing drinks and great food. Yes, it is pricy but it is the best."}
{"text":"This is top notch dining. Located in Crystals at Aria on the 2nd level. Five of us came to celebrate a birthday last night and we requested the \"tree house\". This is a wooden structure which almost floats in the air, very unique for sure. 

We were seated in the center and were lucky enough to get Paul as our waiter. Paul is everything in a waiter you could ever ask for. Knowledgeable, very attentive, funny and yet professional giving us excellent service during our meal. 

He was helpful when selecting wines as well as explaining the menu. I ordered the dungeness crab cocktail and the 22 oz bone-in ribeye. I love seafood and was planning on the seabass but couldnt resist the ribeye. Our table split sides of gorgonzola mac & cheese, creamed spincach and Gnocci with alaskan king crab. 

The crab cocktail was excellent. Served in a dish with 2 sauces and dry ice it comes out smoking. It was about 10 large pieces of crab ($28). The ribeye was also very good ($58), although a tad to fatty for me. It had good marbling like a ribeye should but parts were a bit too fatty. 3 of us ordered our steaks medium rare and they all came out rare. Beware they do tend to undercook  a bit, but we all finished them as the meat was so good. 

The gorgonzola mac and creamed spinach ($14) were both really good. We were a little disappointed with the gnocci however ($33). I found very little king crab in the dish but the flavor was there. For dessert we ordered 3 of Mastro's famous butter cakes which come with vanilla ice cream. 

Paul was nice enough to personalize one of the plates with a \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. The butter cakes were awesome (and quite large). They can easily be split  between two or three people. 

Mastro's provided us an excellent meal with outstanding service. The steaks could have been cooked a little longer but with that being about the only flaw the 5 stars are well deserved."}
{"text":"The food here is sooooooooo GOOD! All I have to say is go here! I had the sea bass and my boyfriend has the halibut and the were both amazing. We also had the tower with crab, lobster oysters and shrimp and everything was great! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm not a seafood lover so something has to be amazing for me to even eat it.  The sea bass at Ocean Club is the most phenomenal thing EVER!  It's shocking to hear that come out of my mouth so you know there must be something special about this sea bass.  The steaks are pretty fantastic too.  And the bread sticks are down-right addictive!  It has great ambiance as well and the piano music is a treat.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"How does this place get that many stars. The service is sub-par, the bathrooms are two flights up, and the bartenders don't know a boxed wine from a good wine. I'm sure the food is good but it's been 45 minutes and I still haven't received mine. The steaks just came out but the order was wrong so off they went. I guess the good thing is that the wine numbed my pain due to my empty stomach."}
{"text":"Expect Excellence in food and service. 

Bone in Rib-eye
Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese. 
YUM.

Oh, don't forget your wallet. You're gonna need it. ;-)"}
{"text":"Standing on a rooftop, I shout \"I absolutely love Mastro's Ocean Club!\"  It's my absolute favorite place to dine when visiting Scottsdale.  I've been 4 times, for business and for pleasure (even though this makes it one of the same, 100% pleasure).

The bar is beautiful, reminds me of an Absolute ad of color and things stacked atop of another magnificently, hence that's why I used ABSOLUTE so much.  I can go on and on about Mastro's, the seafood is terrific, and they even have wonderful steaks.  I have heard about the ship to shore to restaurant process, and it's nothing short of phenomenal. 

But what I really want to focus your attention on two things, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, and incredible, awe inspiring, Seafood Tower.  Focus, FOCUS!

First, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes: creamy, lobstery, and the most perfect mashed potatoes you can imagine (I think they are buttery, too).  They will leave in a state of bliss.  They go perfect with anything you order, seafood and meat dish.  I absolutely adore this.

Second, and without a doubt, the most outstanding thing on the menu, the Seafood Tower.  I've had it small (3-4 items), and I've it large (7-8 items), but I get it each and every time I go to MOC.  They clear the table, fast before your eyes.  Then, they bring out the monstrosity, a tower, 2/3/4 tiers depending on how much is ordered for how many, and the thing is smoking.  Literally.  Served on dry ice (and regular), it's a feast for king.  You have your choice from snow crab claws, crab legs, blue crab, oysters on the half shell, lobster cocktails, jumbo shrimp, lobster tails, among others.  Each and every selection is the freshest thing you can have.  I love it.  I would make sweet love to it!  It's pricey, but worthy of making credit card payments.

It's a chain, I know, but the food and service has always been outstanding."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Mastro's. It is the perfect place for a special occasion. We went to this location to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The bread basket is filled with goodness. The ahi tuna tar tar was excellent. We both ordered the steak and it was delicious! Mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus were Good too. After dinner, they even included a slice of chocolate cake on the house for my boyfriend. Amazing! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"12oz. Filet was very consistent with the great reviews this venue is receiving. Bartenders are very knowledgeable and welcoming. Regardless of if it's location in a mall or a hotel, this restaurant has a big future ahead of it."}
{"text":"Our first time at this Mastros.  We've been to others so expectations were high and they lived up to it!

Sat in the Treehouse which is very cool.  Others complained about feeling like you are in the middle of the mall, but it didn't bother us.  Our server Leonel was attentive and very personable.  Outstanding service and he had a sense of humor!

We started with the shrimp cocktail which was fantastic. Sometimes the really jumbo shrimp are chewy but these were tender and tasty.  

Hubby's filet was cooked perfectly and the Mac n cheese is to die for.  I was craving some crab so I had 2 king crab claws of the appetizer menu.  Wow!

Of course you can't go to Mastros without having Butter Cake.  OMG!  It's like no other.

Great meal for a great date night!"}
{"text":"Fine Dinning at it's best! Wow! If there was an option to give this place 6 Stars I would! 

Ordered the stemmed mussels to share and I ordered the new york strip steak, medium-well. Mashed potatoes, roasted jalapeños and roasted Brussel sprouts were and excellent choice. 

The steak was probably one of the best steaks (if not the beat) i've ever tasted. Cooked to perfection, tender and juicy and very flavorful. 

jalapeños gave just the right amount of heat. 

The staff and management went above and beyond in order to accommodate our party. 

Overall probably the beat fine dining experience I've ever had although I can't say that I'm a regular at fine dinning places, much the contrary. 

The decor of the restaurant , the ambiance, the food, the staff, the management were all absolutely amazing. 

HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend next time your'e in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love Mastros!
Pricey but worth it!
The Shrimp cocktail is amazing"}
{"text":"Just Great!  Mastro's Ocean Club is a must STEAK HOUSE (we weren't there for the Ocean fare), inside this shopping venue."}
{"text":"This place is great! We came here for a company event (~30 people) as we were staying around the corner at the Westin for a few days. We had a cocktail hour in the bar area and then a 3 course dinner in a private section. From start to finish the dinner was flawless and well executed. Definitely one of the best \"work event\" dinners I've had. 

The atmosphere was very modern, sleek and totally unexpected for a steak and seafood place. I really enjoyed it but once we were seated I saw little of it since we were partitioned away from the rest of the restaurant by huge curtains. 

The cocktail hour started with sushi, sashmi tuna nachos, huge cocktail shrimp, and a couple others. I loved the nachos the best but everything was pretty good and great finger foods (not too messy/difficult to eat). I also had one of the gin martinis off the menu which was very good.. but strong. 

My only complaint is that the appetizers didn't seem to be cohesive with the dinner courses. They were a lot heavier than the apps but equally delicious. I had caesar salad to start which was good as far as caesar salad goes. Filet for main course with family-style sides of mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, and string beans. I liked that they perfectly cooked the steaks for each guest the way they liked and the servers had no trouble keeping track of everyone's steaks. The family style sides were also great so that we were able to all try a little of everything. Finally, I had the signature butter cake which is unlike anything I've ever had. It tasted like a sugar cookie turned into a soft cake and it had a nice caramelized crust on the outside. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I'm glad we finished our trip in Arizona here."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I truly don't think a better steak exists anywhere in the world.  Total perfection.  Also a great (albeit overpriced) wine list and great seafood.  Sadly, however, I find myself totally incapable of dishing out the requisite amount of ass-kissing required to dine and/or receive quality service here.  There's nothing I hate more than eating in a restaurant that acts like you're patronage is somehow inconvenient to them, especially considering the fact that I think my wife and I are pretty low effort, high return customers.  
Ocean Club is worth it on occasion for the awesome food, as much as I hate to admit it."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but the rib eye was overly seasoned. The brussel sprouts where not oven roasted but burnt. The lobster bisque was excellent but the mac n cheese was dry and not saucy. The only good thing was the two bottles of wine we drank."}
{"text":"Very good.  Cocktail waitresses seem to be a little overly taken with themselves.  Trust me, I've been to  more and better places than you...dial back the 'tude.

Food very good.  Wife has allergies and they've been able to tend to them.  On some nights they have bathroom attendants.  I don't need that.  In concept the idea seems classy.  In practice it's creepy."}
{"text":"This was our second experience at Mastro's and it was better than the first. I am a fan and would highly recommend. Samantha was our server and she hit all the high points. Her attention to detail and insightful explanations make this restaurant a GoTo place in Las Vegas. Thank you"}
{"text":"Like a nightmare written by Edgar Allan Poe.  The food was rich in flavor, decadent in appearance.  Yet the service was atrocious.  For absolutely no reason, the staff had a bad attitude.  Maybe their manager treated them badly so they took it out on us all.  My cheerful nature was no match for the bleakness they threw at our table, like a shadow cast across the pristine.  When we received the bill, something we never ordered was on it.  No kidding!  We paid the beggars and left.  Luckily there are a hundred better places less than a 5 minute walk from this unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"We had such fun hanging out here last Friday!!!! Love Mastro's Oceanclub and Steakhouse both in Newport Beach and in Scottsdale.  Oysters time with my boyfriend and a bottle of Justin Cab...yummy yummy and great company with our dear friend celebrating 4th of July belated!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was eating there on Sunday June 7 with my family. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really relaxing. Very classy. The waiters were very careful when serving. I ordered the 12 Oz filet. It was AMAZING, the best steak I have every had. I also had the lobster mash potatoes, that was also a very delicious choice. I couldn't finish it all, but shared it. I was very satisfied when I left. They also provided us with a vanilla yellow cake with cream cheese, topped with vanilla ice cream,  strawberries and oranges with homemade whip cream. I loved it! I am definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"Went for my friends 50th birthday last week. We all loved it great service delicious food and a complimentary dessert. French portion is huge!!! Definitely on the list for our next visit. Suggest reservation."}
{"text":"Score!

This place is a short 5 minute Uber ride from the Venetian. It is actually located in a metropolis that contains a lot of high end stores. Its located on the second floor overlooking the shopping area. Don't let the location fool you this place is absolutely on the money. The food was absolutely delicious. The service was absolutely amazing. Our waitress was one of the best I've had in a while.The customer base is upscale which is what I expected based on the price. I took my wife here for her birthday so it had to be great. We had Belvedere Martini's, Oysters, Chilean Sea bass, and one of the best deserts I've ever had. They had blue cheese stuffed olives for our martini's which is a sign of a true upscale restaurant. We had such a good time we walked back to our hotel suite. Great food, Great service, comfortable atmosphere. I'm not picky I just know what good is.

{"text":"First time at Mastro's and loved it!

One appetizer, One bottle of Wine, Two Steaks, Two Sides, Dessert, and Tip =  $300. 

We got the most expensive appetizer and one side was the most expensive, so you can make your adjustments. But look to spend $250 for two people. 

Loved our waiter and they treated us very well."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating at Mastros in Scottsdale for the very first time. I'm not easily impressed with restaurants having owned one myself but I must say the meal was phenomenal. The service exceptional and my bone in filet was absolutely seasoned and cooked to perfection. If you are looking for a restaurant for a special occasion I highly, highly recommend Mastros! The butter cake was to die for. Expensive wine and liquor menu to accompany the meal. Knowledgeable employees that were as pleasant as you could ask for. I'm definitely looking forward the visiting here again. So much so that I'm looking for a reason! Thank you Mastro's and we hope to see you soon. You have restored my faith in restaurants. Hats off to the chef! A little pricey but if you know that going in you going to have a great meal."}
{"text":"the steak i had was terrific.  but the best part was seeing mike tyson there.  i sent him a chocolate cake with the help of my waitress who was super friendly and accommodating.   there was a live piano player playing great tunes the whole time."}
{"text":"In a single word, Awesomeness....  For a restaurant that is part of a chain of restaurants, there's really nothing that can compare to Mastros.  There's nothing chain about the experience or the ambiance of Ocean Club.  

My last visit here was on a night in the middle of the week.  That didn't stop what seemed to be the rest of Scottsdale from coming here for a great evening of food and libations.  When you walk into Ocean Club, there is an ambiance that simply states sophistication and upscale.  

I was fortunate to be on the arm of a dashing and handsome gent as we were joined by another couple.  We were seated promptly for our reservation at a fantastic table that had a great view across the dining room.  The service was impeccable.  We ordered drinks and a bottle of wine suggested by our server.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and we were set for while as we looked over the menu and carried on conversation with our friends.  

My friend and I are pretty easy to please at restaurants like this.  Dare I say, we're pretty predictable.... for me almost always I order sea bass if it is on the menu and my friend 100% orders bone-in filet.  We were in luck, they had both on the menu as a great and amazing establishment like this should.  Their sea bass was as buttery and delicious as it was the first time I had it and all the other times thereafter.

So, the sides are where we usually get somewhat creative.  I suggest the lobster mashed potatoes, so very yummy and succulent and filling.  Not something I would order, but I definitely enjoy when someone else has ordered it at the table!  The garlic mashed potatoes are also tasty.  My friend loves the creamed corn.  My personal favorite is the sauteed spinach.  

For dessert, my friend loves Mastro's butter cake and we never go there without having it.  Again, very tasty and delicious.

This is a place to bring your mom for her birthday or parent's wedding anniversary, a woman that you are with that you care for or just care to get with.  This place is fantastic.  It is truly as good as it gets.  I'm also a HUGE fan of Mastro's Steakhouse.  I'm totally biased, this is the best restaurant chain on the planet.  Period."}
{"text":"We made our annual Christmas visit to the Ocean Club in Scottsdale last night and had yet another fabulous experience. This time we were well taken care of by Nick and his colleagues. My wife had the halibut and I had the big eye tuna. Cherry crisp for desert. I just wish the Ocean Club will open a location in the Washington DC area, which is where I live.,"}
{"text":"There are so many good things to say about this place. The food is awesome!!! You really can't go wrong with anything you order. Try their Kobe beef.....sinfully delicious and your eyes will roll to the back of your head!! Melt in your mouth yum yum yummy!!! Warm butter cake is off the hook and so are their chocolate souffles. Wait staff is great...they will always be there when you need them!! As will the bathroom attendants!!! LOL"}
{"text":"1.  You need to ask for Cole to be your server! He made our night. 
2. Don't pay attention to the reviews discussing the prices. It's a great restaurant with outstanding food and worth the price 
3. The portions are huge! We came home with a \"bag\" of doggie boxes! 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you're a seafood lover, you'll absolutely love this place! Mastro's is an elegant dining experience in the centre of the Shops at Crystals.

At our visit, we had the Oyster Rockefeller, Twin Lobster Tails and Pacific Swordfish. The food was absolutely delicious! We were the most impressed with the oysters and lobsters! 

Overall, we had such a positive experience and we would highly recommend Mastro's to all."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I have never been treated so poorly in my entire existence like a lowly guy called Rudy treated my friends and I last night when we went there to celebrate my friend's 40th.  It was a surprise birthday for a friend who is a Neuro-Oncologist that had worked all day long. We had been assured that the restaurant lounge opens till 1pm from a call to them while planning, We got there at 10:30pm and without any sensitivity, Rudy proceeded to be so outrageously rude to our party! It was breathtakingly rude that i was aghast! The birthday girl was so embarrassed and what was meant to be a joyful occasion turned sour instantaneously! I would love to know,  just for sanity sake why Rudy felt justified to treat us that way? Is he racist because were a bunch of women of color? Or sexist because we were women? I'm still baffled hours after the incident.
Between the 6 of us, 4 are medical  doctors and other two are IT specialists. We were not rowdy, were polite throughout the encounter but Rudy chose to act like a crazy jerk and I want answers as to WHY!!"}
{"text":"Dined at Mastro's ocean club this evening looking forward to a good piece of fish. I ordered the featured fish Halibut this evening. You have 4 ways to have your fish prepared, baked, pan fried, blackened or \"Oreganato\" which was described to me as lightly breaded fish with melted butter. That did not sound good to me! Thinking that I was safe having the fish prepared blackened, well I was wrong. The blackened fish had no seasoning and my fish was dry and over cooked. They actually served some form of tarter sauce on the side. Which was not what I usually would have had with a nice piece of fish. Our server was not very helpful and we really felt that the place was way overpriced and our food was typical chain restaurant caliber. No creativity! If you like good quality food with a knowledgeable server who knows what good food is, don't go here!"}
