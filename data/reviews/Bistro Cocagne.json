{"text":"Montreal's bistro scene is a bit overloaded - two years ago this place would have gotten 5 stars but the total overload of French restos in the Plateau is starting to fatigue everyone. They're all generally good but they're so similar, they're starting to blend into one another.  Cocagne, in particular, has a really open, light layout. There's lots of space but it's no cavernous and impersonal. The decor is simple and elegant - red accents throughout, dark wood, and some really colorful striking artwork adds the right ambience.   The service is great - the two waiters were extremely friendly and very verbose in their descriptions of everything offered. We went with some lamb ravioli, roasted piglet, roasted fowl, and chocolate/hazelnut cake. Everything was perfectly done, nicely presented, and delicious. The bill came to a predictable $160 for two, including wine, and that's sort of the theme here - predictable, good bistro fare.  Overall, nothing too risque - Cocagne is just a good, simple, solid experience. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went there with a group of five and we were the only one in the restaurant on -a Sunday evening at 9pm. Apart from that, the food was great. And the service was good too.   I started with some good venison. Then we shared some amazing foie gras: very fatty and delicious. Then I had the shrimp risotto (that was not the greatest) and I finished with a white-chocolate dacquoise. I would normally not take white chocolate but it was delicious and I'd take it again."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in many many years. The atmosphere is wonderful and the food is plated so well. The service was okay for most of the meal, but failed between mains and dessert when the waiter just seemed to disappear. While the appetizers (a soup and a salad) were wonderful, the mains were too salty (ravioli) and well the beef tartare had so much mustard that we wondered if we should call it mustard tartare instead. We actually wondered if maybe the chef had a cold and wasn't tasting his food. Definitely not to our taste. Considering that we held this restaurant in such high esteem and how wonderfully balanced the salad was, we were shocked at how ill prepared the mains were. It's too bad, because the location is wonderful and romantic."}
{"text":"A great romantic place to take the lady out on a night for some french food....elegant and classy is to describe the environment...there isnt much selection in the menu but the wine is superior....another great thing about this place is that it opens late til 11pm"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. What a place. The restaurant is small and cozy. Service was kind and hospitable. The food is presented so elegantly and nicely that you don't want to touch it. It is a work of art. My bison with vegetables was amazing and melted in my mouth. It all went down like a dream with a nice bottle of red French wine. My family and I sat and lingered to the point where the food and wine had been so satisfying, I was actually getting a little uncomfortable and falling asleep! I had been a long day anyways and this was the ideal way to top it off. Expensive, but worth it. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty great dinner spot. Great for dates. Would probably be good for a first date because the food would be agreeable to pretty much everyone. When I went I had the roast  suckling pig with a maple flavored jus and puréed parsnips. The suckling pig was juicy and perfectly cooked (a light pink color to the flesh) and went surprisingly well with the maple jus.  Now before I go on I should make a note that I'm not a huge desert person.  That being said this place has the best desert I've ever had (would even give Bakesale Betty a run for her money, or close to it). What is this wonderful desert you say? Well to be honest I can't remember its crazy french name but you'll know if you see it because it's for two people. What is it? Well its a kind of baked pudding in the english (if I were a better gourmand I would know what it would be called). Judging from the taste and texture it would probably be devilishly easy to make and I'm glad I don't know how because I would surely die of obesity. Anyways, this pudding comes out hot from the oven and has a slight crust. Once you break through the crust you find a substance that is at once like cake and pudding and altogether heavenly. So heavenly in fact that two of my fellow diners fought over it with their spoons! I should mention that it comes with homemade ice cream which is a nice touch.  I suggest that you sit near the windows if possible so that you can watch the St. Denis pedestrians while you eat.  Wine list is good. Wait staff is superb."}
{"text":"* Sous chef needs a wake-up call *  I really wanted to like this bistro.  It has all the markings of what could have been an excellent meal.  But sadly some of the little details that were not paid attention to (likely by a sous chef) left me with a less than enthusiastic reaction.  The ravioles d'agneau (lamb ravioli) with mushrooms and white truffle oil was a nice start.  The lamb filling was tender and had a good amount of lamb flavour, which balanced nicely with the mushrooms.  The truffle oil was not detectable though, and perhaps the sous chef forgot to apply it?  Overall a nice dish, even without the truffle oil.  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=jLu2DKP9ehtTBjaAmVvYrw  The dorade poêlée on salicorne and chanterelles was again a nice concept dish.  The salicorne were cooked perfectly, as were the chanterelles and combined to form a platform for the fish.  The fish was crisped nicely and had tender flesh.  But unfortunately that blasted sous chef forgot to remove all of the scales.  Boo.  So what could have been a really nice dish ended up having me have to descale it (I didn't have the heart to send it back - although in retrospect I probably should have).  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=CjvrmxiLIB-_9ZbWSY5Ijg and a soft-focus close-up of some of the scales left behind:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=jIGFE0-6VaFhLPUwM_Waiw Leaving scales on fish is truly sloppy and a real shame for what otherwise was a nice dish.    They had a nice selection of cheeses on offer, and we ordered a plate with a variety of three (Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=4eXptUoul87FaYu0ouybSg).  The Beemster Gouda (pictured on the far right) was the highlight.  It had a flavour that reminded me of salted caramel.  The plate came with a nice apricot confiture as well as some cranberry crisps (http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=G0QbGoiCc9PVKAjnCX_wfg).    The strawberry mousse was served on top of a layer of chocolate ganache with fresh strawberries on top.  The berries and the chocolate ganache were the highlight of this dish and the mousse was a bit flavourless (damn sous chef again?).  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=DMV2XoO3xCjswnK141b55g  The chocolate \"bouchon\" didn't strike me as a bouchon, but more of a ganache square.  It was served with a vanilla ice cream, a nice salted caramel, and topped with caramelized peanuts .  Photo:  http://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/Wbagz9_qZe10Rq3_g1FGzg?select=67IkWHYv20tCQZ2xj5EGGw This dish was a winner.    Overall there were some signs that this could be a great bistro.  But the lack of attention to detail was truly disappointing.  While I'm blaming the sous chef, in reality it is the head chef's fault for letting those dishes out of the kitchen, no?"}
{"text":"= Bar review only =  We were doing our \"Night of a Thousand Snacks\" routine, in this case ping-ponging from place to place on St-Denis, having a bite and a sip at each place. We were not familiar with Cocagne - we saw it, liked the look of it and went in. Such a treat. We each told the bartender what style of wine we were in the mood for and let him choose the glass. Spot-on selections in each case.   We looked at the menu, but weren't in the mood for a full meal at that point (clashed with the evening's theme). The bartender suggested the hors d'oeuvre of salmon tartare. We ordered three servings, which come in won ton soup spoons. They had to make ours à la minute because of my allergies. Absolutely delightful, with a bit of capers.  We had planned to hit up a nearby sushi bar, so we asked the bartender his opinion of the place. He hadn't heard of it, but suggested another Japanese resto that we might like. He offered to call them to see if they could fit us in without a reservation, it being a Friday night. Bear in mind that this is occurring while Cocagne is serving meals just metres away from where we are sitting. And there were tables available. This, my friends, is the hallmark of the good server. He listened to what we had said upon arrival - just here for drinks and snacks - and had offered us their menu. When it was clear that we weren't going to install ourselves for the night, he suggested a taste of their offerings, more wine, and a recommendation for another establishment that suited our immediate needs. Having done all that, what do you calculate the chances are that we will return on some other evening to partake of the full experience..? Or tell friends and yelpers about our great experience? Well done, lad."}
