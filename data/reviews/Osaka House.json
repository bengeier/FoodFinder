{"text":"This place is a definite pass. Seems like they cut corners with everything but it's still just as pricey as quality places. We ordered delivery and the food took over an hour to arrive, the sushi was warm, and very underwhelming. Most enjoyable part of the meal was the after dinner mint."}
{"text":"Food is OK but their service is absolutely terrible. Don't ask for delivery cause it will take forever. And if you order a soda they'll give it to you in a wired soup container."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has so many terrible reviews, I love it! I will point out a one thing though, all of these reviews were written much earlier in the year and I think it has changed ownership recently. Apparently this has made it much better, though I never saw it before as I just moved to town a few months ago.  What do I love about Osaka? Most of all I think it is great that they have a dance club upstairs that is open to 2am! Most of the time when I go there ironically it is to dance, not to eat. Though on that note I have eaten there several times and I think the food is good. I will be the first to admit that I am not exactly a sushi connoisseur, but I have always gotten great service and been satisfied with what I had. It is a little expensive but I never thought it was outrageous. By the way, they make sushi till late as well (at least 2, probably even later, I have eaten there right at bar closing time), so if you want a fun night go dance and drink upstairs then come down after and have some sushi!"}
{"text":"Just don't go there. They may give you some else than you want to have.  I was one that used to go there at least once a month.  (The only reason I go there is because there is no sushi place near my place.) I had a terrible experience there last time, and I never go since then. What happens is that tempura sauce (basically, soybean sauce) they gave tastes like Sake, so I told the waitress the sauce tastes strange. What she told me is that it is fine, but she took it and gave a new one, which tastes fine. I asked what happens, and she said nothing and the previous one was not different from the new one. They claimed that they make the sauce every day so that they cannot be different. Thus I asked her to bring the old one and she said it is already poured out. I felt something fishy about it, because they taste totally different not only to me but also to my friend, and I am pretty sure what the tempura sauce tastes like. She suddenly came to us and suggested some discount because of it although they think there is nothing wrong with food.   You might guess what possible can happen in their kitchen.....  By the way, their service is quite poor. The waitress is very lazy. I think it is because Osaka' house owner is her father(, which I heard from her, and I have no idea why she told us that) You also can find their tables are not clean enough to get served."}
{"text":"Won't be back.  We ordered tempura which was cold and greasy.  We received our soup, rice and salads as we were leaving the restaurant.  The wait staff needs retraining and the management needs to focus more on the patrons at the tables instead of all the order out business."}
{"text":"I'm trying to find a good sushi place that isn't too pricey that I can order delivery from - after Osaka, I will keep looking.  I ordered a crunchy scallop roll, spicy salmon roll and a New York roll (tuna and avocado) for delivery - $1 delivery charge and pretty quick (30 min) delivery was great.  $25 for 3 rolls - pretty good.  But the actual sushi??  Not so much.  I don't know what was missing but all the rolls were very bland.  I couldn't even really distinguish by taste which was tuna, which was salmon, etc.  They all tasted the same - of nothing.  The crunch was dried panko on top of the roll - not too tasty.  I would say try some other places first if you want that mouth-watering sushi taste that makes you crave it - because it isn't here."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. If there is 0 on Yelp I would go with 0 stars. Worst Japanese restaurant in town. Greasy place, rude servers, food doesn't worth the price. Last time they charged $20 tip for two people without our permission. Will never go again."}
{"text":"We were in Madison last Sunday and cruising State Street for somewhere to eat after 9:pm.  There aren't many options for just food at that hour, Osaka House seemed a decent choice.  Because we were hungry by that time we ordered a whole bunch of items (does that sound like a Seinfeld episode?).  All but one were pretty good and none were excellent.  The sole \"just ok\" item was a tempura platter with several items, mostly vegetables, on it.  We probably opted for the shrimp and chicken arriving with 1 shrimp and 2 chicken.  I'd steer away from it. Incidentally, I say probably because the menu is from their site is unavailable.  Just a guess but maybe it's because I keep my \"cookie\" vault locked as much as possible.  Sure, the vault could be culled but why do they need access to it anyway?  While waiting for our order(s) we noticed a menu on the wall listing items with a $1 discount after 10:00.  We had already been presented with the check but because we were not quite sated after the first round, and the time was now past 10, we tried 2 or 3 from the discounted price list.  (Boy, talk about poor sentence construction.)  Anyway, I was curious to see if we were to be charged the discounted price on items ordered after 10 and we were.  Hurray!  Our tab for 3 was $69 before tip.  The waiter was sufficiently attentive and competent while attending the one or two occupied tables inside and one or two outside.  Not related to the waiter are the restaurant's listed hours.  At 11:pm they showed no sign of closing yet, their website lists 11:am to 9:30 7 days a week.  Yelp lists 10:30 to 10:30 all week.  A case of summer hours, perhaps?  No doubt I've had better sushi but this was alright.  Maybe there are better sushi places in Madison but this one appeared sufficiently clean and the food was as above.  I'd consider going back and would give it a shot if I were you.  The questions below remind me:  Searching for a Wi-Fi signal, one was listed for the restaurant but even though it appeared unlock, we couldn't connect and didn't ask for help."}
{"text":"it was probably my fault for ordering it when there were better options on the menu, but the chicken wonton soup I ordered was not the best, kind of tasted like they needed to do something with their extra chicken.  My friends were content with their sushi and ramen.  My real concern was that the cook came out and took a cigarette break, and we were downwind of his smoke.  I don't think it's terribly appropriate for him to be smoking so close to patrons.  Also, our table was sticky and had an odor.  I would also maybe think about cleaning that awning; it's quite dirty."}
{"text":"the worst restaurant ever, expensive, bad cooking skill, horrible,the rolls are tiny!!! Do not come"}
{"text":"Stopped in for first time for lunch. I was looking for Chinese food and based on pix in window this Japanese restaurant offered same.  Hot and sour soup was outstanding.  Perfect balance, very rich broth, and good amount of peas, green onion, noodles and egg white. Mongolian beef was just as savory with rich flavors and a nice amount of fresh green onion.  Small deduction as condiments were inconsistent from table to table, and mine were, unfortunately, in need of a good wipe to clean. Also, steaming rice was served in an ice cold bowl. Also, entree was unevenly heated.  Overall though, good food and a nice, diner-like authentic environment."}
{"text":"I haven't read the reviews for Osaka House.  I found it by simply searching out good Sushi on State Street.  I've since been there many times and have never had a poor experience.  It is small but when the weather permits, sitting outside on the sidewalk and watching the street life makes for an awesome experience.    Tao (the owner) is ever present and extremely attentive.  He has always been very helpful in making suggestions on different rolls and I, nor my guests, have ever been disappointed.    The price for what you get is, in my opinion, a great value.  I sent an out-of-towner and her guest there and they agreed, it was fantastic.    Tell Tao that Brian sent you and have a great experience!"}
{"text":"Yelp reminded me to review this place, because apparently I checked in here recently. After looking over this place, I was thoroughly lost as to when I've checked in. I don't recall having sushi recently.   Then I remembered... It was Friday night, and we've just about visited every bar on State Street before we wanted to go dancing. We didn't know where to go, until a friend recommended this place.  And by \"recommended,\" I mean he drunkenly slurred the name of this place with the word dancing thrown in there.   So anyways, we get here, and it's actually a sushi house. Ok, sketched out a little, but no problemo.   Then we walk through the kitchen area (I kid you not, we were legit walking through the kitchen while people around us were whipping up California rolls like nobody's business), until we reach a dingy set of stairs. Ok, at this point, we're getting more sketched out, but someone yelled out yolo (probably a drunk me), so we had to continue on.  After going up the stairs, the door person asked for our IDs and literally did the fastest mathematical calculations I've ever seen. He basically scanned our IDs for a second, handed it back to us and let us in. I mean, this dude either has photographic memory, or is super overqualified for his job.  Anyways, we went in the club (???), which was basically a bar, a cramped area next to the bar (the dance floor, I believe) and the actual dance floor being occupied by the DJ and his ginormous set. The crowd was basically Snooki's gang, with one or two peeps as confused as we were.  Upon seeing the clientele, I immediately turned around, mouthed the word \"nope\" to my friends, and left.  However, having said all that (mostly negative things), going through the back of a Sushi kitchen to reach a what should have been Asian themed club filled with Jersey Shore people was a once-in-a-lifetime-experience.  I'd definitely recommend you guys to go at least once, just to be able to cross that off of your bucket-list.  Otherwise, stick to the more erm.. established venues"}
{"text":"Although the environment is not that good (quite small and a little noisy), but the sushi rolls there are truly awesome. The price is also reasonable compared to many other expensive restaurants on the state street. Moreover, I am really a fan of the Unagi Don (???) there, which has eel and kelp over the hot rice. Overall, 4 stars."}
{"text":"So I've ordered from here twice. Both times I got my food so quickly I was finished eating it LONG before the 'expected delivery time' from GrubHub! So that's super awesome!  The food is good. Not mind blowing, but its hit the spot! I'll order again for sure!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is actually quite nice. I was scared by the former awful reviews but it turns it out I have a nice dinner. :) udon tastes good with lots of scallop. Sushi is not bad at all. Just the sushi soy sauce is so salty. Overall great! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is one mediocre Japanese Restaurant   (Osaka House, not cheap - came up to 39 including tip for an average tonkatsu)   It's because the woman got cold, became whiny and refused to walk a few more steps to the Mediterranean one. I'd never be caught dead in a place under 3.5 stars unless it's Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve. Restaurant bar was terribly empty.  Avoid! Tourist trap."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's small but cute and the two tofu dishes they have (hibachi and teriyaki, if I recall correctly) are very good and huge portions."}
{"text":"First off, I'm really unsure as to whether this is actually a new business, or if the people who named their restaurant \"Sushi Hut\" are trying to escape the low-rent connotations (and history of bad publicity).  As far as I can tell, there was no down time at all between sushi restaurants in the same location.  On the other hand, when I met a friend for lunch there yesterday, the menus were labeled \"Edo Garden,\" which as far as I know is not a restaurant that exists in Madison (not to be confused with Edo).  Anyway, to sum up: it might be slightly better than/a different restaurant from Sushi Hut, but I don't plan to go back.  Pros: I will say that the service was miles better than what my spouse and I experienced the one time we visited Sushi Hut.  The waiter was nice, and kept our hot tea topped up.  He also split our check without us even asking, and unlike at Sushi Hut, we were not required to wait in line to pay.  The lunch special is $11 for only two rolls (it's $10 at Takara a couple of blocks up), BUT you get both miso soup and a small garden salad with that (at Takara you have to choose).  I had the gyoza as an appetizer, and they were excellent by my standard--which is to say, they reminded me of the ones I used to buy at Family Mart down the street from the Tokyo YWCA when I studied abroad.  Definitely not fancy, but yummy.  Cons: The lunch sushi roll menu is limited, and they don't even have a three roll option.  Crunchy spicy tuna wasn't on it, although I got special dispensation from the chef to have it with the lunch special.  However, it was disappointing.  I like spicy tuna to have all the ingredients mixed together--tuna, spicy mayo, and tempura flakes blended, then made into sushi.  Here, they do a tuna roll and drizzle the mayo and sprinkle the flakes on top.  I know other places do something similar, but the tuna is SO bland that it still tastes bland even with the spicy mayo.  Also, the spicy mayo had an extremely sweet undertaste which I did not enjoy at all.  I also got the sweet potato tempura roll, and the sauce they used on it was VERY sweet--tempura rolls typically get a somewhat sweet sauce, but this was way too much.  Overall, I had no desire to finish my rolls, because they were both way too sweet.  Minor gripes: They put ice water in tea mugs.  Who does that?  It's especially annoying if you're actually drinking tea out of an identical mug.  Also, they don't have the usual rectangular dishes for soy sauce/chopstick rests, which wouldn't be so bad if they gave you disposable chopsticks so that you could make your own rest out of the wrapper, but they don't--they give you heavy plastic sticks, with nothing that you can actually put them on.  We had two courses and had to put our utensils on the bare table in between, which is GROSS.  Based on the gyoza, I suspect this might actually be a halfway decent place for non-sushi Japanese options: gyoza, maybe ramen (god, if they'd do a real ramen place on State Street it would be AWESOME), yaki soba, etc.  But much like Sushi Hut (and this contributes to my suspicions about this being a cosmetic overhaul), I feel like they have the technical skill to make sushi fine, but they just combine stuff in such a way that it's totally unappealing.  Takara is two blocks away, cheaper, and makes far superior sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty darn good! I've been 3 times and have enjoyed it immensely. The place is a little rickety... not the nicest, and I definitely don't suggest taking a trip to the downstairs restroom. It's kinda nasty/smelly on the lower level. The prices are a tad high. Buuut other than that I've been happy! This place is home of my all-time favorite sushi roll- the Osaka Roll: shrimp tempura, avocado, pepper white tuna and sweet shrimp garnished in a mayo and fish roe. SUPER DELISH! Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Horrible. Worst service ever.  Waitstaff was like zombies on Ambien.  Didn't have filet to make hibachi, sushi average, first time we left zero tip at a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to try it out, I warned them against it. I caved because maybe it was just first day fluke.  After the waiter brought us items we didn't order (and still charged us for them), didn't bring us what we had ordered, was extremely slow in serving us, overcharged me, and charged one of the other girls twice (albeit an apology was given from the waiter, nothing like \"Oh, have something small and cheap free on the house the next time you come in!\" or any other method of good customer service was offered), and the owner just kind of stood there the entire time doing nothing as this was going on other than saying she didn't know how to fix it--  My friends agreed with me. Sucks to be us."}
{"text":"I cannot stress how bad this food and environment are. I feel like they should be shut down. I don't fully scoff at hole in the wall places so I was willing to give it a shot hop get for a great food experience. Horrible, just horrible. Horrible everything. Soft mush rice, unidentifiable meat, dirty water glass, all other tables dirty upon arrival. Late salad. Just bad. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Pros: The (new, I think) owner of this restaurant is clearly trying to make this restaurant run well.  He is attentive, polite, and courteous.    Cons: The sushi.  I've only tried the spicy tuna hand roll.  I have to agree with the previous poster-- it was nasty.  Rather than mixing the ingredients together you get tuna with a gross glob of mayo on top.  The sickening sweetness that undercuts whatever spiciness there may have been comes from the rice, I think.  Nasty."}
{"text":"Don't ever use a credit or debit card here they hacked mine and a friend's cards!!! chicken fried rice is the BOMB just pay with cash though it's worth it. 0 stars for stealing my money but 5 star fried rice. 1 star customer service they suck here lol"}
{"text":"We went with a friend of ours who's parents owned a chinese restaurant and was huge fan or all types of asian cuisine. Well he no longer trusts my suggestions.  Our first and only time here was beyond disappointing. Our friend ordered dumplings and he knew something wasn't right by how fast they came out-microwave. The orange goop on my sushi was less than appetizing as was the rest of the food.   $63 for horrible horrible food and lame service was an experience I could have passed."}
{"text":"Decided to try as a new sushi delivery spot. We ordered roughly $200 worth of food for delivery. The orders were all messed up with names not labeled correctly, they took over an hour to deliver and the quality was so-so. We're not going to order again. We'll stick with Edo or Sushi express for delivery sushi."}
{"text":"There are plenty of sushi joints in Madison, and plenty with delivery, too. This Japanese cuisine is definitely not my cup of tea (pun intended). The food was subpar. I ordered a spicy tuna roll and a veggie roll. They were skimpy, the rice wasn't really sticky, and it just didn't match Madison's sushi standards.  I ordered this as delivery, and was told that my order came with a free appetizer since I had ordered $25 worth of food. It took over an hour for soup, sushi, and one appetizer to arrive. Then, after they had left, I realized they forgot the free appetizer (which was the reason I bought one extra roll in the first place). When I called back, I was told they'd return in less than 10 minutes with the appetizer. They never did.  I guess I'd give this 1 star as delivery, since the food came so slowly and really didn't taste good, almost like it sat too long before getting delivered.  I gave it 2 stars, because my friends and I have sometimes received quality sushi when we have dined in. So perhaps if you do check this place out, definitely don't order delivery. Try a different spot in Madison for your late-night sushi cravings."}
{"text":"I came here on a whim because I was wandering around on State Street.  It's kind of a whole in the wall it appeared to be clean. I was greeted right away and seated. I was given a menu and they had a good selection of sushi, appetizers and other dishes if you weren't in the mood for sushi.  I ordered a tempura shrimp roll, edamame and dumplings. The food came out quickly and it was very good.   I would definitely come here again if you are in the mood for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice and it was okay the first time but the second time my sushi came with eel sauce even though and I did not ask for it (I am vegan). My tempura roll was cold like it had been sitting for some time.  Paid a lot of money but couldn't eat my dinner."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this place. Just a caveat: we did not eat the Japanese food or the sushi, we tried their new Chinese menu. We had the Szechuan chicken and the ma po tofu and we thought both were tasty, mildly spicy and fresh. This is a small shop, so plan to share; all the dishes don't come out at the same time, which is a little inconvenient if you're going to wait for everyone to get an individual dish.Space is small, with an open kitchen, and there's nothing fancy about it, but the price is right and we really enjoyed it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't be persuaded away by the atmosphere and small space inside the restaurant. If you are looking for sushi and fast service this is your place to go. They've got the regular and oft-ordered sushi rolls mastered to a tee. I would recommend their Happy combo as the best bang for your buck. It includes a salad, miso soup, and 3 rolls - Eel, Spicy tuna, and California roll. Pro tip: there is a bar upstairs that has a pretty cool atmosphere at night!"}
{"text":"The lunch bentos ($10-$14) are a lot of food for the money and yummy. Lots of choices."}
{"text":"Yum! Service is fast and efficient, better than most sushi restaurants I've been to in California! I recommend the Lady Gaga & Fashion rolls! Best rolls my husband and I have ever had!"}
