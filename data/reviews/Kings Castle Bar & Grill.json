{"text":"We are regulars here, and the staff here are fantastic. The owner Ray always makes sure we have a great meal. Kelly is an amazing and attentive server.   The food is always good. The wings are probably the best in ajax.   You'll find either a dj, live band or karaoke on the weekends. Great place to come watch the game too.   Definitely a hidden gem. I've brought several people here and never heard a complaint."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Black Bear a lot. I particularly like the price points and the food I would eat there multiple times a day.   One day or ordered more wings than I should've. So I took them home.   I ordered the wings around 7 o'clock. Left them in my car for roughly 45 minutes to an hour tops in cold weather.   When I got back to my car my car smelled absolutely rancid. No doubt it was the wings.   I couldn't believe how quickly it took for them to go bad that led me to believe that the wings where in fact old probably prepped sometime the week prior.   I do like this place and maybe would return  but I highly advise you all to eat with caution."}
