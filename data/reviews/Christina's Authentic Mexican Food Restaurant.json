{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall restaurant. The food is outstanding and the prices are great! Customer service is out of this world. The owner has a great sense of humor and will always make you laugh! The chicken bandido is so yummy!"}
{"text":"This family owned restaurant is one of my favorite authentic Mexican food restaurants. The staff is very friendly and the restaurant is very clean. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. My family enjoys going there."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident but so glad we did! The owners are so nice and the food is authentic and delicious!! Would definitely recommend if you like Mexican food! The prices are great too."}
{"text":"I guess you could say that service beats what the food actually tastes like to me. The food wasn't awesome in my opinion that other Yelpers have you suggest, but then again I've only had it once but will definitely try it again.  Walked in and was kind of taken aback at first. Its set up like Los Taquitos over in Ahwatukee: shotgun straight to the back where you order food, with sets of tables on either side. There's a bathroom, too. It didn't seem inviting but it works. You can either read a menu or they have pictures on the wall of everything you could order.  Its the owner who took our order and he was very friendly and professional. We sat down later and he brought us our drinks with chips and salsa. The salsa is on a little on the spicy side. Our food soon came and they're decent portions. He would frequently check up on us to make sure everything was ok.  One interesting thing was that an elderly lady and a little girl came in and just sat down. They didn't order anything. The owner asked them if they were ok and they said they were just waiting. A couple minutes later he brings them chips and salsa too. I felt that was nice of him even though they hadn't ordered anything (or hadn't yet at least).  This, for me, is another one of those places where I might go back if I happen to be there. I do recommend it to at least try once. I saw that they have pazole which I'll have to try some time."}
{"text":"Great food - great people! Don't be fooled by the strip mall - hole in the wall appearance! Absolutely delicious & authentic food! It's small so if you show up at lunch time there might be a wait! We ate at 1:30pm w/no waiting! But I would wait - it's that good!   SherrybFoodie"}
{"text":"Very good food. Much Better quality than other fast food places with comparable price."}
{"text":"Love this small neighborhood restaurant! The owners are a total delight and I am always trying new things off the menu and never disappointed. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So, I grew up in San Deigo and have a strong opinion of what Mexican food should taste like. I have been searching for a good carne asada burrito since I moved to Phoenix, to no avail. Based on reviews, I decided to give this place a try.   First impression: small and simple= perfect!  The fancier the dining area, the less authentic the food tends to be. I place my order and the gentleman (I think the owner) was super friendly, attentive, and polite. I sat down to wait and the daughter (about 4) of the owner left her food and came to say hi. She is adorable. Loved the family feel.   The food: Confession- I saw they also offered machaca burritos! After a strong internal struggle, I opted to try both the carne asada and machaca...just to 'sample' them. I tried the carne asada first- delicious!  None of that cheap rice filler other places in az tend to stuff in there and the meat had a great flavor. The tortillas were delicious as well. I stopped about halfway as I realized I had the machaca. Bit into that- very happy with the flavor. It didn't bring back memories of home, but it was delicious in its own right. I ended up not being able to stop and ate BOTH burritos, by myself, in one sitting. Very impressive feat for me.   All in all, I was so happy with my experience and the food at Christina's. I will be sending everyone I know here, as well as returning frequently!  Thanks for making me miss home a little less!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good. A family restaurant with great Mexican food and awesome, friendly service. I like putting my dollars back into the local community, and the food here is just plain better than the big chains. Don't let the homemade signage  and small dining area fool you. This place is clean and the food delicious. Eat here; you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Moved to Mesa 4 years ago. Just ate here for the 1st time today. Wish we had found this place sooner.  The carne asada was really good - tender and we'll seasoned. My husband had a machaca and egg burrito which he said was delicious. The dining area wasn't dazzling but the tables and the floor were clean. The kitchen looked clean as well. The service was fast and friendly. Paid less than $20 for a whole bunch of food. Would eat here weekly if it was closer to our place. The owner said they have been in business for 10 years. That's saying something for a \"hole-in-the-wall\" type of joint."}
{"text":"I love Christina's and she is so sweet and her family is wonderful and the food is great. Love the salsa!"}
{"text":"Good food. Clean friendly  We had shredded beef tostadas in china plates! We will go back"}
{"text":"This was a last minute find for my husband and me. We had just finished hiking and wanted authentic Mexican cuisine. This place was it! Such a nice family owned and operated business. Freshly made everything, and truly authentic!! We will be back, and I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone! Thank you Christina's:)"}
{"text":"Came here on recommendation from Orange County, Ca, Register while in Az for Spring Training. They were right on. Family run by an enthusiastic owner. Food was basic and authentic Mexican. Will make it s regular stop on our visits from now on."}
{"text":"I have been a very loyal customer here for the past 8 years. The reason - this is the best authentic Mexican food I have ever had and the service is great! What more could you ask for?  Manuel and his family have been so kind to me over the years as I have come through here with friends, family, and more times than not, have just come alone to spoil myself with amazing food. If I spend too many weeks away without coming in for a meal, he always let's me know that Christina and he missed me. I am known by name and order here, and he even knows my regular table. The only negative comment I have to say about this place is that they are not in my backyard!  Now that I have moved, it is worth the extra driving to get Christina's at least a few times a month (I wish every day, but you can't have everything you wish for sadly!). They are truly the epitome of an awesome small business and the American dream. I am proud to support their business and am happy that I could convert so many people to Christina's Mexican Food lovers over the years.   Thank you all for your delicious food and I think I might come in for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"Very good Mexican restaurant, it is small but have some of the best food we have had. We travel a lot & have had some very bad food!  We will return to this restaurant.  The people were very friendly & made sure we were satisfied & had everything we wanted. You won't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place, for those of you that took your time to write a low reviews go back and give this place a 2nd chance. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was referred here by many friends and teachers and I've always said that the best Mexican food comes from hole-in-the-wall restaurants, so Cristina's just makes me agree more and more with that.  From the second we walked in, my mother (who LOVES Taco Bell \"Mexican food\"...) and I felt completely at home. Manuel, the husband, and Cristina, the wife, are truly authentic friendly people and I could tell the food was cooked with loved. Excellent prices, would recommend EVERYONE who likes Mexican food to go, and would go back any day."}
{"text":"This place is awful. After reading some of the reviews, my husband and I decided to give it a try. Tacos were comparable to Taco Bell. Place was dirty. We found Nando's for great Mexican food."}
{"text":"I decided to try something new and decided on Christian's based on its yelp reviews.  I can't remember being more disappointed in a place.  The chips were soft in the middle and the beans were room temperature.  The chimi a la bandido was the only thing that looked good on the picture menu but real life there were two kraft cheese singlets slapped on top of it.  The salsa and Pepsi were good and that's all."}
{"text":"I kept passing by this place when i'd go to Safeway and i finally decided to give it a try on wednesday. It was a wonderful decision, i ordered a carne asada burrito to go and it was pure perfection. The guac and salsa inside are real chunky guac not that watered down version of guac. The meat was tasty, the tortilla smelled amazing and tasted even better. Coming from someone who grew up 30 minutes from the Mexican border it makes me super happy to find hidden gem of REAL AUTHENTIC Mexican food! I absolutely have become addicted to this place, i just finished my burrito, second time in this week. Its that good. I cant wait to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Christina's is so delicioso it makes me want to cry! Seriously. I have brought almost all my immediate family members and friends here to enjoy their authentic, fresh dishes. If I lived in the area (and didn't just work nearby) I would go much more often."}
{"text":"Awesome place we just found! We had the green Chille Burros and they were perfect!  Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Completely LOVE THEM! They are my favorite Mexican food in east mesa! Its a small family owned place so the hospitality is REAL! Nachos, Tacos, Burritos. . .  ALL AMAZING!!!  yummmmm :)"}
{"text":"Closed on Saturday!?  Clearly said open.  Door was locked.  No sign on door stating closed.  Looked inside and saw people catering out the back door.   If your gonna be closed at least post it!   Bad business practice!"}
{"text":"Fresh...Local... Family Owned and operated... and as authentic as you can get in the east valley! Whats not to like...frequent this place!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here at least once a week. The food is affordable and delicious! It is family owned and they are the friendliest people. Definitely a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"My daughters and I stopped in here on a whim one afternoon and fell in love. This tiny, hole in the wall joint is truly a gem. We've made it our #1 stop for delicious Mexican food and find it hard to go anywhere else! The family that owns (and operates) this tiny, tasty restaurant are always super friendly and treat their customers like family. Best horchata EVERRR!"}
{"text":"I am completely surprised at the reviews for this place! I was excited to try it only to be sorely disappointed! I ordered a ground beef taco and a bean and cheese burrito, deep fried. The taco was tiny. In a supermarket shell and the ground beef was flavored with McCormicks taco seasoning. I have made better tacos for my family at home.  The burrito was huge, but flavorless. The salsa was meh and I don't care for blue chips. I want small mom and pop shops to succeed and I waited and debated for a long time to decide if I wanted to write a review, but I am also tired of trying ABSOLUTELY AMAZING places only to be disappointed when I get there. I say don't bother with this place,"}
{"text":"We are from out-of-state and my husband and I saw this reviewed on yelp. The service was excellent and the little place was very clean. As soon as we sat down they brought over fresh warm chips and salsa. Both excellent. We both got the chicken hard taco combo. This was the best rice we have ever eaten!  The beans were very good also. We liked the way they marinated the chicken used in the tacos. The reason I did not give it a five is because the shells are pre-fab and the portions are a little on the small side."}
{"text":"The pretty girl next door recommended you.  Great food!  Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"Love this little family owned place, great service and good food and value. Support the small guy!"}
{"text":"Mexican food is such a subjective cuisine: what you grew up eating, where you grew up eating it, how it was prepared, what your memories are of who prepared it and how you compare what you eat now to your memory leads to a score of reviews and opinions.  Oftentimes the ambience will lend to, or take away from, the experience and the pleasure of dining - it can even influence the perception of flavor and taste: add in exceptional service or a poor attitude and you get even a larger spread of positive and negative reviews. Such is often the case of many noteworthy Mexican restaurants not receiving the proper review, or a high enough review (or an uncharacteristic not-the-norm low review), because of their location, time of visit, service, wait time or even decor.   I typically rate the taste and quality of Arizona Mexican food by two items: tacos and bean burritos. Now, those beans can be put in a burrito, tostada or served à la carte or the tacos can be soft, hard, crispy, grilled or battered and fried - I use these two food items as my south-of-the-border barometer for Arizona Sonoran style Mexican food.  These two items tell scores about the recipes and the kitchen that prepares them.  Are the tortillas made on premises?  Are the shells pre formed?  Have the meat and legumes been stewing on the stove for hours prior to severing?  A tasty bean or decent tasting taco filling and we have an a-ok rating.  A tasty taco AND flavorful bean and the rating goes up; the rating goes higher if the other food items offered are of the freshly prepared variety.  However, if both the bean and taco are not up to snuff, a package or can was used somewhere, I give the the Mexican food restaurant the benefit of the doubt so long as there is value and quality - otherwise we are at two stars (franchise territory).  I have eaten at Christinas before, many years ago, and visited about once a year over those years.  It was because of good reviews and mentions that brought me back here and kept me try trying them again, but I just couldn't bring myself to write an average review; I had to be missing something . . . so here I am, back again to see if anything has changed, and it hasn't, which is to say that it is still just average.  I hate to use that term, but there is no single thing or group of things that make Christina's stand out food-wise.  It hits the marks on local, mom & pop run, hidden away, divey atmosphere with service that is friendly, hospitable, and very prompt -  for that it gets high marks and keeps me coming back to see if we have attained four star status through the food.  However, after another recent visit, with exceptional service, and just slightly above-average food, there are too many other choices, nearby and far, that are tastier and worth the drive.  Overall Rating: 3.4 Stars Food: 3.5 stars Service: 4.5 Stars Cleanliness: 4 Stars Atmosphere: 3 Price/Value: 3.6 Stars"}
{"text":"Great enchiladas, nice and simple setting, don't expect fancy surroundings, but you'll get a great meal cooked by someone who knows her stuff. Well worth returning."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we happened upon this hidden gem, otherwise would've never found it! The food was authentic and fresh and didn't leave us with that gut bomb feeling you get when you eat at say, Filibertos! In addition to great food the service was top notch, the guy at the counter was super nice and extremely attentive to us during our lunch visit. I highly recommend Christina's, so much so I'll be making the 10 mile trek from Gilbert more often!"}
{"text":"Christina's oh how I've missed you! I moved to Goodyear 2 years ago and have not found a mom and pop Mexican place like Christina's. I'm in Mesa today for a party and just had to stop in. Love this little \"hole in the wall\" place! Good food! Great service from a hard working family."}
{"text":"Let me start off by asking, is there some sort of inside joke to giving this place a good review? My friend and I saw the good ratings and decided to go and try a new place... We should have went to Moreno's instead. The salsa was the only redeeming quality about this place. The chips were soft and so tough you could barely bite through them (How is that even possible, this place literally created an oxymoron) nothing on the menu looked good except for the Chimi ala bandido or whatever it's called to make it seem authentic and well... Just look at the picture below to see the actual look of it, it was like they borrowed two slices of cheap cheese from burger king (which is where I ate afterwards cause my meal was disgusting...I'm serious ) my tacos were cold and the lettuce was extremely soggy. The beans were also ice cold and resembled runny...well just heed my advice and don't eat there!"}
{"text":"The family that runs this is by far the nicest sweetest family ever. Their food is delicious. Tamales are our favorite. Their beans and rice is so delish! The man who owns the place always remembers us and our orders. He is very attentive and genuine."}
{"text":"I love Christina's! It's a tiny family-run Mexican restaurant with delicious and affordable meals. The owner and his family are extremely friendly and always make me feel welcome. They can tailor menu items to be vegetarian and dairy-free, if desired, which is fantastic. I go here for lunch whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall stashed in the corner of a strip mall. Had picadillo burrito  DELICIOUS, order extra salsa to pour over for more spice. Seating is limited. I'm eating here mid afternoon. Right now, my husband and me are it. Worth a try."}
{"text":"This small family owned restaurant is hidden in a strip mall.  Do not let the small size fool you, this place is great!  I have been here a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed.  The pricing is inexpensive and you can tell it is handmade.  The only downside is I wish there was a little more seating.  There are like 4 booths in the place.  Every time I come, I feel obligated to take the food to go due to the lack of seating."}
{"text":"Had the chicken burrito with beans/rice on the side.  Nothing to write home about but it was OK.  A little dry.  What was a little off-putting is that I heard her microwaving food (there wasn't anyone else in there but me so it was for my order) so part, if not all, of my meal was microwaved.  Can't say I would make the stop here again, too many really great Mexican places in the east valley."}
{"text":"Searched Yelp for a Taco Tuesday and found Christina's.  $1.25 for a taco and very tasty.  Ordered 4 shredded beef tacos and a soda for $6.50.  Absolutely great red salsa, the green was heavy garlic but the red hit all the right buttons.  Chips brought out as a first made this place a step above a hole in the wall at great value.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"I came into this eatery with an empty stomach and a high standard for Mexican food. Between growing up in the southwest and being Mexican American, I've had my fair shareof Mexican food within the last 35 years and can honestly say that this place is the \"real deal.\" I'd much rather spend a night eating tasty yet inexpensive food versus going to a place like macayos, where the food is overpriced and far from homestyle. For a quick & guilty pleasure, treat your taste buds to Christina's."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best Mexican food in Mesa. Family owned, they are the nicest people, and the food is amazing. Great Prices! Incredible salsa!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny hole-in-the-wall, with friendly staff.  It was very clean.  We were expecting large portions for the price, but we're very disappointed.  I ordered a chimichunga, which was good, but tiny.  My husband ordered a Carne Asada burrito and the meat was awful, grisly and hard to chew with no flavor.  sadly, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Plenty of Yelpers gave this little spot high marks, and with good reason! I stopped here and ordered Camarones Mexicanas (Mexican Shrimp) and flan to go. I spent $15 and change and waited less than 10 minutes. When I got home the food was still hot and tasty. Everyone there was friendly and I will return."}
{"text":"Love their Carne Asada, everything is made fresh. Will definitely use this place as our go to for quick mexican food."}
{"text":"I will be honest I  visited this establishment  to try their Tamales.....Are you Kidding!!!! $2.50 for each Tamale.... NO Way......and this establishment charges you for everything (Keep it Hidden ) I think that it is very petty to charge a customer for Condiments.....really I am eating in house???? If your food was seasoned or prepared correctly their would be no reason for the extras....My vote is simple.....I WILL PASS.  STOP GOUGHING YOUR CLIENTELE !!"}
{"text":"The service is very friendly.  I ordered a chicken flautas, chicken taco hard shell and cheese enchiladas.   The taco is American style, lettuce cheese and tomato.  I prefer a good street taco instead.  The chicken was a red baby food mush that tasted more like BBQ chicken and it was microwaved.  The cheese enchilada is also microwaved.   The flautas tasted freezer burned and was topped with cheese only so I ordered a side of guacamole which seemed homemade.    I added salt to everything but that may have just been my preference.   The price was cheap, but not a place I would visit again, there are too many other great Mexican restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Nothing to get excited over. Seemed a bit expensive for what we got. The owner was nice. But took awhile for our food and both plates were bland and dry."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food! We come here every few weeks and everything on the menu is fantastic. The service is amazing as well! Taco Tuesday's are a favorite in our home! Highly recommend this family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"I only found this place because of reviews on Yelp.  I usually pride myself on knowing all the Mexican food places.  You know how everyone talks about that hole in the wall with great food that you can tell are old family recipes?  Yeah....this is that place.  Just tucked in the corner of the plaza its in, you gotta know it is there to find it, but it is worth it.  I had the carne asada plate.....tastey.  There are four sitdown style Mexican restaurants within about five miles that charge twice as much for food that is half as good.  All this and the staff was very friendly, which seems to make everything taste better.  BTW-The salsa is SPECIAL!"}
{"text":"Well....its 130 and your sign says you're open until 3 today but your door is locked. No closed sign. No lights on. Yelp says you're supposed to be open until 4pm. If I could give you zero stars for wasting my time, I would. Yelpers should call ahead to make sure they aren't closed when they normally are open. The owners should at least put up a sign of they are unable to keep their hours."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall? Literally.  The most authentic tasting Mexican food I've had? Yes. Alcohol? Nope. Walk-up ordering board? Yup. I love small family run restaurants for this exact reason. You find the gem and you support it.  The food is wonderful. Punch full of flavours.  This is also the first (of 5 I've been to in 2 weeks here in AZ) that serves you chips and salsa where the chips are actually freshly made and served hot!  The customer service was genuine and so very friendly.  The food? Exactly what I was missing. I've been looking for that genuine taste, and I finally found it.  Every bite delivered."}
{"text":"I'm a purest. I like beans and cheese in a burrito. I know it's basic but if a restaurant says they are \"authentic\" that is where I'll start.  The beans have a slightly odd flavor by themselves but with salsa, cheese or both; Christina's nails the flavor. I would go back just for that taste. I added pulled chicken which a lite tomato flavor. The chicken was lean and complimented my bean and cheese burrito.  The salsa has a kick and it is a classic style. Very good.   I think Christine's nails quality and quantity for price.  Is it better then Los favoritos ? ( I'm sure I'll get a few frowns) I think in the basics they are both good. Los flavoritos is probably more in quantity but I'm sure Christina's kicks ass in its other specialties."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try for a while. Stopped in for lunch. Got an Arizona burrito. Took 10 minutes to make. Home made tortilla. Small and bland. Not worth going there again."}
{"text":"the food here is super delicious and the family that runs the place is very friendly. You might see their kids running around. The horchata is yummy. I've eaten here many times. its a small place so dont expect a fine dining experience but food is delicious. My favorite Mexican food place."}
{"text":"As much as I tried to like this place, it was not good at all.  The carne asada burrito was small, dry and salty. The side order of guacamole was an embarrassment due to the miniscule size. All the prices on the menu have been changed (higher cost). $6.99 and up for a breakfast burrito? The 5 star reviews for similar items as I ordered are unreliable."}
{"text":"So good. The customer service is amazing, the food is delicious, and the pricing is right on point. Their salsa is to die for. This is definitely my favorite Mexican food joint in AZ."}
{"text":"Sorry about the one star, but we went back with my brother and his wife and not impressed at all. The front door had so many greasy finger/hand prints on it we almost stopped upon entering. There was a party of three about to enter and you could see them looking at the glass door and they just turned around and kept walking. The food was mediocre this time, and the dining area was not as clean as it should of been. Don't know if the owners had left or they had a large party before we got there. I'm not sure if we'll try it again."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing after reading and hearing about their Tamales but worse were their Tacos. The Taco shells were not fried but like those you get out of a box at the grocery store. The tamales were pretty dry and the beans weren't authentic, I think they were from dried packaged beans. The cheese served over the beans was pre-packaged. Their menu looked pretty good so maybe we just ordered the wrong thing. They were friendly but a little over priced. I had my hopes up but oh well."}
{"text":"Love this Mexican food!  It's absolutely delicious and definitely authentic.  It's not super fancy and they don't serve alcohol, but it totally hits the spot.  There is good heat to the green chile and I love the tortillas used.  Customer service is great, but you may want to have a back up plan if it's late in the evening.  The hours listed are until 9pm, but more times than not, they are closed by 8 during the week."}
{"text":"I'm writing this in a partial food coma from eating a filling lunch at Christina's.  The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and service is cheerful.  Unfortunately, they did not have horchata when we went, but they do have a wide array of Pepsi fountain products (Including Diet Dr. Pepper), as well as bottled water and canned sodas.  They have a Taco Tuesday special (.99 per taco, choice of different meats), but today I chose to try the chilaquiles ($6.99).  You have your choice of meat (Beef or chicken) and choice of sauce (Green or red).  I decided on the green chicken chilaquiles.   We were served chips and salsa while they were making our order.  The chips were hot and fresh, and were light and crispy.  The salsa had a robust, full flavor, with just a little kick of spiciness.  The chilaquiles were a very generous portion, with refried beans and Spanish rice.  The green sauce was nice, but a little too acidic for me, so it was nice to balance the acid of the chilaquiles with the beans and rice.  The chicken was finely chopped, and tender, and there was a good amount of shredded, melted cheese on top.  I tried some of the hard taco, which had a nice, crispy taco shell, with good portions of meat to veggie.  Like mentioned before, the meals here are very filling, so come here on an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"Great place! Very nice and polite man, food came quick, and it was delicious! Definitely coming back and recommending this place to my friends!"}
{"text":"Great food, decor is plain but clean and we will return soon! Beef green chili burrito was just spicy enough and delicious! Nice people run the place."}
{"text":"My favorite, favorite place for tacos, chips, and salsa! The owners are kind and the food is terrific."}
{"text":"Wow. I must have hit a bad day. I was so excited from the reviews. These little \"local dives\" usually have the best food too!  I would maybe give 3 stars... Only if the price weren't fairly high- for a local dive.  Last week I had enchilada / taco combo at a close and decent chain restaurant. It was 4.99 and surprisingly good!  I'll review it next.  I ordered the lunch special of the day: 3 enchiladas w/rice and beans.  The good: service was good- man very kind. Chips good. Salsa very good. Rice (which I seldom like ) good. So... 3 stars.  Now- bad part: The enchiladas were barely warm. Cheese hadn't melted and the tortillas were stiff- as  they were almost cold! Worse though (well... Maybe) was the sauce. It wasn't deep red, but sort of light orange. It had short of sour taste. Could barely eat them.  If I hadn't been hungry and rushed- I wouldn't have. Beans were great texture and nice cheese. But their. Taste seemed a little off too. Not enough not to eat them- just  Enough to not really ENJOY them.  The price was almost 9.00- but that included a drink- which I never get as all I drink is water for lunch. But I got iced tea and it was good.  I don't think I'd come try again- but I must have hit an off day. But I would advise to NOT order the enchiladas ."}
{"text":"This is not a Mexican restaurant it's Salvadorian. The food is good, but the service is slow."}
{"text":"7 tables, no beer, menu on the wall.......OMG...I'll be back as soon as I can!  The enchiladas with green sauce takes me back to the El Charro in Chicago 20 years ago (my all time favorite).  They are as close as I've ever had to those.   If you had a Mexican grandma she is cooking here.  For standard Mexican fare a lot better would simply be subjective."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant.  It is a standard storefront that a person can perhaps easily overlook.  It is hiding in a strip mall.  If you are looking for a simple lunch, this is a good place.   The menu is on the wall.  The waiter and owners speak limited English."}
{"text":"Closed early.  You only get one chance to make a first impression.  Family wanted Whataburger. I stopped by at 7:52 on a Tuesday to try them for my dinner. Made a special trip.   Food? Nut sure but I can tell you that the service sure sucks.  They wouldn't even look at me when I tried the door. I just tried once because a guy was there sweeping. No acknowledgement of anything.   Bad."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened when my husband & I ate here, but it was the worst food we've ever had at a Mexican spot. I'm really confused by all of the great reviews, I consider myself a total fan of mexican food, my Hubby actually calls me his ''White mexican''. The food was very small portioned, flavorless, and I couldn't even finish his taquitos & I was still hungry. We paid $4.50 for the ''special'', and got 2 TINY dry taquitos. No lettuce, guac, or anything to go with them. I don't know, maybe we went there on their worst day. Won't be going back though, and I'm in that shopping center all the time."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in town!! Always fresh, made from scratch. Abuela Christina is almost always there making sure it's top notch.  We like the beef chimichanga and the many variety of hot sauces.  If you like it hot, ask for the extra spicy green sauce.  Ask Manuel for the diet water and virgin margaritas ; )"}
{"text":"The food is excellent here and the staff is very friendly. It's a family owned business that's survived for some time now. Primarily a husband and wife who own the business and work basically all day and night. It's a hole in the wall place but some of the most authentic Mexican food you will find in the area. Also, their Christmas tamales are a huge hit! If you're looking for somewhere good to go here's the place to stop!"}
