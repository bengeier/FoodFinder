{"text":"J'ai essayé le Das Food Truck au Premiers Vendredis de juillet. Je l'ai surtout choisi pour la courte file qui avançait vite. J'étais aussi tenté par l'idée de manger un schnitzel.  Le service est efficace et sympathique. La qualité de la bouffe est correcte, mais la portion de schnitzel était ridicule. Pour $11 j'ai eu droit à un schnitzel au poulet de la taille d'une carte de credit avec des frites passables et du chou braisé quand-même très bon. Mais ça m'a couté $11 pour une portion de fast food qui ne serait même pas considérée comme une entrée dans un vrai restaurant.  Les prix élevés pour la bouffe de rue à Montréal semblent inévitables, mais je m'attends quand-même à avoir de la qualité et des portions raisonnables. Le \"schniitzel\" de Das Food Truck n'est qu'un vulgaire doigt de poulet au panko. Pour $11, ils devraient faire mieux."}
{"text":"Wow !! Très surprenant a voir....les délicieuse recettes qui sortent de ce \"resto-roulant\" nous a tous vraiment impressionné! :)  je le recommande a quiconque veut vivre une expérience en bouche inoubliable. (Merci Das Truck)"}
{"text":"Pretty good meal for the price  I would highly recommend trying the DBL which is 2 schnitzel with cheese and BACON in the middle.  Reasonable price at 6$ and amazingly good, especialy the with the BBQ sauce and bacon in the middle.  Few german dessert options would be awsome but amazing truck overall"}
{"text":"I'm kinda deeply in love with this food truck now. The food was just out of this world! Also, the guys in the truck are awesome!  I ordered the DBL meal with cabbage on the side as well as fried oreos for dessert, yeah that's right, FRIED OREOS! The DBL is a breadless sandwich..layers go as follows:  schnitzel-smokey bacon-cabbage-cheese-schnitzel. Boom: flavor bomb in your mouth. But if I'm being honest, my favorite part by far was the cabbage. It was so rich, I'm thinking it was cooked with bacon fat, a few blueberries and thyme? Ohh yeah, the Oreos were so heavenly, they kinda got soft inside and all melty...yummmm.  Would i go back? Yup...already planning my next trip."}
{"text":"It was a cold rainy in late May, the perfect day to accidentally forget that I'd brought my lunch to the office because SCHNITZEL! I had the schnitzel plate that is served with two sides. I had their German Pickle salad along with a mound of crispy sweet french fries. The fries were amazing with the curry wurst dipping sauce as was the crispy, perfectly fried chicken schnitzel.  While the plan was to bring the lunch back to the office in pristine and showcase ready condition we barely made it 5 feet before pecking away at the edges of this mitt-full of food. This is no box of MacDonald's take-out that offers no temptation.  No, this meal beckons to you in no uncertain terms to have \"just one nibble. Go on, just one...\"  The pickle salad was not made of pickles as I'd hoped but rather with cucumbers. Super tasty, the crunchiness of the sliced cukes and the creamy dill dressing balanced the tangy curry wurst sauce beautifully. OMG So good!"}
{"text":"I had no idea that they would be at festival Gueule D'Érable! I just saw the word BACON on the truck so that's where I went right away and then found out I had just eaten at their resto a month back.  We got the large maple poutine to share! The bacon was very crispy and some not so not so it made for a nice texture. The cheese which they give a lot of was cold and Fresh and the gravy wasn't dark wasn't light it was just right.  I can't wait to try more things on their menu as this time They only had a a few option and had a maple theme To go with the festival."}
{"text":"You can find better at this price (13$ burger and drink) Service was long (even without any customer in front of us) and so-so (bread was cold) no napkins. Won't go back probably"}
{"text":"Had an amazing lunch here a while back! The lineup for this food truck usually isn't as long as some of the other ones, and you get your food fairly quickly, which is definitely a plus, since food trucks are generally supposed to be fast. I got the DBL (not the combo) for $8 and it was amazing. The DBL is two pieces of schnitzel with cheese, bacon, sauerkraut all inside. Especially since I'm not the greatest fan of bread or buns, this sandwich/burger was simply perfect. Although the DBL looks small initially, it will fill you up for a nice lunch and the schnitzel is done to perfection - not too oily, but still very crispy and satisfying.   But be prepared though, this isn't a salad or an extremely balanced meal, so if you're looking for some greens, then it might be better to save this for cheat day."}
{"text":"You ever order something at the recommendation of the waitress and as soon as she leaves with your order you immediately regret your decision? I think that just happened to me at this food truck. I ordered the sausage plate and picked the fries and cucumber dill salad as the sides (with the currywurst dipping sauce). I knew for sure that I should have changed my order when the person taking the orders / cashier said that the currywurst sauce was like a mayonnaise mustard... I could tell by the name \"currywurst\"  that it was not a mayonnaise mustard (what ever that is). She said the sausage was the superior choice - so that's what I went with. Anyhoo, the plate was good, don't get me wrong - but I should have opted for the schnitzel. I saw someone walk away with their schnitzel and it looked like a delicious thing of beauty. The sausage was good, tasty. Juicy even. But the schnitzel looks special. I hope this truck comes back to my hood soon because I need to be united with that sweet sweet schnitzel sandwich. And if anyone from Das Food Truck is reading this - please, for the love of God and everything delicious - stop making us choose! WHY make us CHOOSE?! Just create une assiette with both the schnitzel AND the sausage (or schnitzel AND sausage ON the poutine? Is that going too far?) Call it the \"everything plate\" and charge what ever you want for it - I don't care - that's what I would order!"}
{"text":"Bon contrairement à bien des Food trucks, les portions sont généreuses. J'ai opté pour le menu schnitzel avec frites. C'est la première fois que j'essayais le schnitzel, donc difficile de comparer. Pas trop fan, mais j'imaguine que c'est une question de goût et qui n'a rien à voir avec le Das food truck. Le service était rapide."}
{"text":"The Schnitzel Truck was at the St Jean festivities at Millenium Park today.  My husband tried the Schnitzel burger which came with fries and a spicy mayo.  He said he wished that the burger was cooked just a tiny bit more, but that it was still really tasty.  I tried some of his fries and I really enjoyed the taste, especially when paired with the spicy mayo.  *The kind business owners have told us it wasn't cooked as much because it's a sandwich, not a burger, so my husband misspoke when he told me what he had ordered!  My apologies!  Thank you for your kind help!"}
