{"text":"I agree with the last two posts, this place is absolute trash. This bar really ruins the beauty of the danforth, it is an eyesore. The gentlemen outside always have something to say when you walk by and it is very uncomfortable. I decided one day to check it out hoping the alcoholics that are there in the wee hours of the morning will have gone home already. However, I was wrong. Drinks are well overpriced for such a dirty establishment. I suggest you do not go if you're looking for a good time."}
{"text":"This is the worst bar in the area. I wont ever eat here again after the food was over an hour late with no real excuse. Wings were also cold and seemed under cooked. Sub par at best."}
{"text":"After calling several sports bars in the area, Legends was the only place who was showing the Spanish league game I was looking for! They have a decent beer selection and a pool table in the back. I like it and would definitely come back to see more games. Id probably give it an additional star if they up-ed their drink menu."}
{"text":"The evening we attended was a few weeks ago and was a surprise, because they had a couple of great performers sharing song and fun. Loved it! Hope to see more online and I would come back again!  Also the service was quick and friendly.  We did not eat this visit since we were there for a drink before meeting up with friends."}
{"text":"I wish I could give less than one star. This is one of the worst bars I've ever been to, actually no it is the worst bar I've ever been to. The waitresses are beyond rude, I arrived to meet friends around 9:30 and walked in and asked for a drink but the waitress would not serve me she just said no. I was very confused and went to sit down with my friends and she would serve all the guys with no problem but I wasn't allowed to be served? I had not been drinking and my appearance was suitable, if anything I was over dressed for such a dingy place. Very bizarre, I left shortly after however when my friend got his bill he was charged different amounts for the exact same drink on the bill. His first pitcher was 25$ the next was 27$ and then 29$ for the exact same drink and size. I have also walked past this bar during the day around 10:30-11 and surprise surprise it's open! And there is always plenty of men smoking outside ready to accost you. In response to a previous poster, I'm not too sure if your race has anything to do with it as I am a blonde hair blue eyed white lady... I think this establishment is just full of undesirable clientele and staff."}
{"text":"Went to this bar last night and the bartender was so rude she wouldn't serve my friend and I for no reason. She didn't even speak one word to us other then to say \"I'm not serving you\"! We asked her why and she wouldn't tell us. We weren't inebriated, we were dressed nicely and she was beyond rude and offensive.  I told her I would post this on Yelp as my only explanation is that she was racist. Being a woman of color I felt humiliated and embarrassed. I do NOT recommend this place with this type of treatment to anyone. Stay away and spend your money elsewhere. Hire better staff, some with less attitude"}
{"text":"This was stop #2 on the Danforth Social Meet's 2nd Danforth pub crawl.  I had been before and still feel like this is an essential stop on any Danforth crawl.

I am not going to be shy--in terms of eye candy for men, this place always seems to have the best looking waitresses.  

Good place to go for basic drinks and beers.  And watching sports.  I think only men come here.   This is no pickup spot.

Nice front patio for the smokers.  The guys my group ran into were friendly.

I wouldn't come here on my own, as I don't go to bars to watch sports but otherwise this is a fine place.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap drinks, playing darts, cards or pool. Food is not so good but big portions. I'd give food a 3. The souvlaki was too salty and bruchetta was too oily. Very filling for a cheap lunch out."}
