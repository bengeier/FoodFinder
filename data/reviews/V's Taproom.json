{"text":"I first came here a year ago July and was very impressed not only for the quality of food but also the service. I have been coming back ever since and was just there again tonight and have made reservations for Thanksgiving day. You should try it out."}
{"text":"We went to the Easter buffet and unfortunately we didn't have a good experience. The food was at best average, the presentation was probably the worst of any buffet I've been too and the fly's were third world. There were at least 30 fly's all over the food that was being served with no attempts to remedy the situation. Sorry guys but it is just the truth."}
{"text":"Great food and price. Sat outside and it was a great view. Can't wait to go back. Went for a birthday dinner. Service was great. Had the shrimp and angel hair paste just the right portion."}
{"text":"Been here many times and have always enjoyed it.  After last night, however , I seriously doubt we will be back.  The service was absolutely horrible!  There were four of us at our table.  The appetizers took 35 minutes to get served.  Chips and dip shouldn't take that long. Then much later they brought a sandwich that one person had ordered. Ten minutes later they brought the two pizzas that we also had ordered.  One member of our party ordered soup. She had to ask our server twice where her soup was.  15 minutes after we rest of us had been served we asked again about the soup. How hard is it to put some soup in a bowl and serve it !  ??  When they finally brought her soup she just asked them to package it to go since everyone else had finished. They said they were sorry and took the soup off the bill. When the bill FINALLY came, we were given someone else's bill. The folder not only had the wrong bill, but it contained the cash that another table had included to pay for their meal. Again we got a\"sorry about that \" from the server.  No mention of desert-   Won't go back."}
{"text":"I am giving this a 5 star rating for a number of reasons: we were there on Friday and let's face it, Friday nights are crazy everywhere in the valley. We were told we could be seated in 25 minutes inside or longer outside (our preference) or sit and eat in the bar. We chose the bar and there was a lower area with 2 chairs right on the end by the door. The outside wait was longer because there was a rehearsal dinner group coming in. We got a drink, sat and talked for a bit and then ordered the fish and chips (excellent, Mahi mahi).  The entire time we sat there I was in awe of the bartenders and the young man who was washing all of the glasses, over and over and over. The bartenders were the BUSIEST bartenders I have ever witnessed. They had every reason to lose their cool and have a breakdown, but they smiled, served, poured, and did it all 50 more times in the hour and a half we were there. They were the most amazing people to watch. They would put 5 or 6 glasses under the beer taps, turn them on to fill, never spill a drop, serve all of them and turn around and do it again. The young man washing all of those glasses was just as amazing as the bartenders. There were times when I thought there were not going to be any glasses for the bartenders to grab, but he just kept washing, drying and hanging them back up. Have been here to eat a few times while we are here in the winter and love everything about it, beautiful setting, good food, great place for lunch or dinner.  Give it a try. I almost always enjoy a restaurant because I don't have to cook, I can sit back, relax and enjoy all of the action ."}
{"text":"Despite the noise on an inside seat on a busy night, the ambience and food are quite good. The drinks are hearty sized at a reasonable price. Outside is amazingly pleasant."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a couple of times for dinner since they remolded and changed names. Formerly known as Verde Grill. We always eat outside so I can't speak for service dining inside. Food was always as described and tasted great. Service well attended to our needs. Price was decent and as expected for a place inside a community on a golf course. Clean and not loud. Plenty of space, you don't feel like you are eating with the table next to you. We shall return again..."}
{"text":"Just ok. The Green Chile mac n cheese was horrible not sure why they tell you it's really good. The menu has been the same forever.  Service one time good next time awful. Bartenders seem to take care of customers faster than wait staff. Guess people just want ok food because it was really busy or there isn't much else around the Vistancia area so they have a captive audience   I could tell some customers were regulars because they got better seating even though we were there before them"}
{"text":"We went to V's for our family reunion on a Saturday morning. We had 12 of us and they accommodated us on the patio. There was another big party and they handled it perfectly. Our food came out in the amount of time expected, they kept our drinks filled, and came back to ask what else we needed. Our waitress was very personable. We had breakfast and it was delicious! Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Trilogy and what a great find.  Food is good and the prices are great.  Happy hour prices are even better.  The servers are the bomb.  We'll probably go at least several times a week."}
{"text":"Walked in... it's a Wednesday 5pm I want to sit outside, there are 7 tables empty, they tell me all are reserved!! 45 minute wait!?!? That's not very customer friendly especially since I live across the street from this place. Won't ever come back again! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Have family that lives in the area and when we come to town to visit, this is one of the places we have to go to.    Other people comment that the place is busy during dinner time.  A restaurant busy during dinner?!?  Highly suggest you try the pulled pork sliders."}
{"text":"Good selection of food & brew. Brussels Sprouts appetizer a must. When we first got arrived, there was no outside seating available but they opened the sliding glass doors and it became outdoor seating and was perfect. Was an unexpected pleasure 5 mins from where we stayed."}
{"text":"I love TV's Taproom.  The atmosphere is great, food delicious and servers are very friendly.  And the menu is diversified - something for everyone!  It is so nice to have this in our neighborhood.  Such an amazing improvement from the Verde Grill."}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Taproom for years. Love the staff, food is great. We came in for dinner last week and Will was our server. He is one of the most personable servers, very professional and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"My 11 yr old son and a gaggle of his friends went here for lunch on Sunday. They were treated great. I was worried a bunch of boys might be given a hard time- or they might be worried about them not having money.  Not the case! Their waiter was very nice and even brought them free pretzel bites.   He ordered the calamari and fish and said they were both really good."}
{"text":"A previous reviewer mentioned the fact that the full bar here has a woman patron who comes in most nights and is usually over-served.  She clearly can't hold her booze and becomes extremely loud and obnoxious.  The bar tenders have NO TRAINING and just keep pouring her more.   We live in Trilogy and know many neighbors who stopped going there because of this. My wife and I were accosted by her two years ago and left angry without ordering food .  We complained by phone the next day but have seen no change since.  On another note, V's Taproom's food is just mediocre.  I ordered a Cabernet Sauvignon to have with my short ribs and got a wine glass 1/2 full of ice cold box wine from their refrigerator.  When I mentioned that my red wine was ice cold I was told by a puzzled and untrained waitress that that was the way they serve it--sort of \"take it or leave it\".  If you stick with ordering greasy fried food, and don't mind eating such unhealthy fare, you will be better off.  Pretty much anything that requires skill or training will be screwed up.  I know this review is really negative, but ask yourself why the Lakeside Grille five minutes up Happy Valley is always packed, even late into the evening?  They have much better food, are less expensive, and are much, friendlier.    I truly wish there was evidence that the management would take these criticisms to heart and upgrade the place-if only enough to attract the more informed diner."}
{"text":"Always have great service from Shannon and Toni at the bar. Terrific food and beautiful views of the golf course:)"}
{"text":"We love V's, and all the guests we've taken have loved it too.  Food, service, views all excellent !!"}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday, May 7th for breakfast. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the beautiful views. The food was delicious and fresh tasting with nice sized portions. We definitely want to come back and try lunch here."}
{"text":"Best place in the NW valley with a patio view. The short rib tacos were delicious! We had a great server and this place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Pros: - Strong drinks - Nice views - Good food   Cons: - Sometimes you have to wait, but they have good food which is understandable"}
{"text":"The food is great,  the prices are fair,  and the view of the 18th green can't be best!"}
{"text":"Everything was good whether food or service. Nice atmosphere to hang out and enjoy a couple of drinks. We have been there twice already"}
{"text":"This is just the type of place we needed in Vistancia. Great food selection and everything we have had has been very good. Decent beer options and the patio is perfect for relaxing and enjoying them. Nice clean atmosphere too, we enjoy walking in after a round of golf."}
{"text":"We love V's! The patio has beautiful views of the golf course and plenty of seating. The bar is indoor/outdoor as well, just make sure you beat the happy hour rush. Their menu has a decent variety and the pizza is pretty good. We also like going there for breakfast, just make sure you check their hours. We have gone and they've been closed so I think breakfast is only on weekends. It can get pretty busy, but we love supporting local places and have been going to V's for awhile now. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I consistently experience great food and great service each time I visit V's. I've tried the Millionaire Burger, Fillet, Sliders, Pizza and loved each bite. The server recently recommended the Salmon topped with Pesto. It was fabulous!!! I also didn't think I was a fan of Mules but the Granda Mule is a new favorite!!! They also have a great Happy Hour!!!  I appreciate the manager stopping by my table to make sure everything was great!!!  Kudos to V's!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go but...... They need to  their air conditioning and they should offer bread sticks since they have a pizza oven to bake them in. The dinner rolls suck! We are here 2 or 3 times a week and will be here regardless but cool us off please! We'll stay LONGER (drink more)"}
{"text":"Always a nice experience at V's. It is a great neighborhood restaurant. The food is good, Staff is friendly and always receive great service. My only complaint is they raised the prices, and at that price point there are some better options."}
{"text":"Excellent...food was high quality in a relaxed atmosphere  Looks over the golf coarse and water feature"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast on Saturday and Sunday. Large portions and a variety of options. Beautiful views of the golf course from The patio.  Tvs outside to watch games too."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places I've ever been to. My fiancé and me were looking to spend a romantic evening together and this place by far exceeded our expectations. Not only was the food fantastic but the service was speedy and professional.  We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"We built a house here in Vistancia, in the newest section.we absolutely love the taproom. Tom the bartender, is an amazing bartender very level headed and handles a huge crowd without being rattled. I ask for unusual drinks he knows them. I ask for special events it's always no issue. We are there a couple nights a week, so the menu can get a little tiresome but my husband and daughter are in love with meatloaf. The Brussels sprout appetizer is over the moon! Oh did I say I don't care for Brussels sprouts? Delish! Pizza is good Fish and chips are excellent , it's usually crowded make a reservation....... can I suggest more tables on other side of fountain?"}
{"text":"What a great place...Mark the mgr., is first in true clients satisfaction.   Food is excellent. Summers menu rocks..  Is becoming our favorite spot for friends, food, beverages and excellent service."}
{"text":"Excellent experience, great staff,great food, and great views and ff the patio. Relaxed but classy. I really enjoyed our meal. Definitely a hidden gem in northwest Peoria!"}
{"text":"This is the best service and dining that I've experienced in a while. Not only did my family and I enjoy beautiful golf course views from the elegant patio seating, but the food was remarkable. We all appreciate that kids eat free on Thursdays. Each of my three kids raved about their dishes which were kid approved and gourmet in presentation. For me, it was the Millionaire Burger. This one was juicy, fresh, well seasoned and cooked to an exact medium, like I wanted. Again, the atmosphere here is totally inviting. Every staff member from start to finish, had a smile on their face and treated us like royalty. I will be back to V's whenever I'm in the neighborhood and I'll be sure to bring my kids back to what has been described as \"The best restaurant  I've ever been to.\" \"Look at this pickle!\""}
{"text":"Love Love this restaurant!! Good food, reasonable prices considering it's the closest restaurant, by far, to our home. Also, The views of the Golf Course are breathtaking. The bar has a cool atmosphere.. Just all around good!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience here! Everyone in our party loved the food and the beautiful atmosphere. The service here was great and everyone was extremely friendly. The only negative was the air conditioning was too cold. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Great place for a cold beer and food. Nice views of the golf course. Staff very good."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place.  A bit far from our house so not on our regular list, but for sure on our now and then list.  Food is pretty consistent, service is usually pretty good.  Like the tap wines.    Last visit I ordered the shrimp pomodoro.  I thought it was way under seasoned, and just not what I expected.  My server immediately took it back and replaced it with another choice, fish and chips.  Which is always spot on.  I appreciated their willingness for the swap and the quick service."}
{"text":"Well, I'm not sure why took me so long to give a review to this place. We love V's ever since they remodeled the place with new menu and more inviting. We love love the wood fire pizza here and steaks are fantastic!!!! Wait staff all super. If we don't dine in we have been doing carry outs almost weekly. LOVE LOVE IT HERE!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood hangout!!  The food is great and superb service.  My favorite starters is the pretzel bites.  The brownie is awesome and the short rib tacos have no comparison!!!"}
{"text":"Great patio overlooking the golf course with mountains in the background! Beautiful! The burger is good and surprisingly enough the pizza too."}
{"text":"we are regular at the VTap, enjoy sitting in the bar, have great service. Morgan,  Jamie l, And Tom are fantastic. Only draw back the last two visits to the bar is that there was a Lady Vaping in the Bar area."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Been here over a handful of times and every time has been a great experience. Only once did we have subpar service but I overlooked it because I haven't seen that waitress since. We've been here with friends who have also raved about this hidden restaurant.   I find the inside bar and dining areas too cold and always sit on the patio. The patio on the hottest of days is still cool. With their mister system combined with the patio-side large waterfall feature you would never know it was hot outside. They've done a fine job controlling the temperature on the patio allowing you to enjoy the golf course and sky. Plus the waterfall is so soothing.   Aside from the one time, we've had great service every time. Tonight, Layton was our waiter. He has a great personality and sense of humor. Plus he's quick and keeps an eye on your table. Fun guy.   Average pricing with amazing food made from local ingredients. My favorite is the crispy brussel sprouts. To die for. They have Friday night all you can eat fish fry that is tasty. My husband really likes their traditional wings and I have to say they are pretty good. My favorite meal is the millionaire burger but I haven't yet tried everything on the menu. I intend to though.   I recommend this local golf club restaurant to anyone. Really good food in a relaxing setting. I recommend the patio your first time. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great menu in a lovely location on the Trilogy golf course. Even in the summer the outdoor patio with misters was very comfortable. Awesome wait staff!"}
{"text":"I would say 4 stars for dinner but more like 2 stars for breakfast food. As many yelper noted, service is slow, really slow. Their patio facing the golf course is absolutely gorgeous. We set comfortably on almost 100 degree weather.  I will go back just for the patio :-)"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and both times were great. Sat outside each time which brought such a beautiful view. They have a nice wide range of food options. I like that they partner with local distillery businesses, which made for a yummy adult beverage. Our server was nice and was tentative. I will be back when I am on that side of town again."}
{"text":"Gorgeous views and great food and drinks!  Perfection!  We loved it!  Get a reservation to sit on the patio - breathtaking!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great view of the golf course. Awesome fireplace outside. Food has never disappointed thus far."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I just didn't feel welcomed with kids (or anyone under the age of 60). Service is slow as well."}
{"text":"Ugh I wish they would stop fooling around with our place for once and for all.  Live in Vistancia for over 7 years.  When we put down a deposit on our house, we ate our first lunch at the Verde Grill.  We LOVED it.  A fab Chicago dog, a Reuben, fish tacos, squash ravioli, etc.  Then came the menu change.  Everything we loved disappeared off it.  Then came the Asian coconut salad so we were happy again.  But they decided it needed an upgrade we heard similar to DC Ranch's clubhouse.  We thought great, being foodies, we'd get a nice restaurant to go out to.  But no.  Now it's a pizza and fried good place with no and I repeat NO vegan or vegetarian options at all.   NONE unless it's a salad your stuck.  What they should have added, was more outside seating!  Half the time you go and the golfers sit outside and there are no tables!  Had the shrimp and pasta and it was spicy and totally lacked flavor.  Not sure if the time is up for V's."}
{"text":"Dropped in for drinks a little late last night, had a small bit of confusion and want to say that the manager, Chris was the friendliest, most accommodating guy! The patio is really nice with a fireplace. Good beer selection and decent food."}
{"text":"I have come here multiple times for breakfast in the past. The breakfast food was mediocre at best. My omelette tasted like a dirty burnt pan. Today we went for brunch with my wife and son. Had a couple meals and a couple drinks. $9 6oz mimosa.. Ended up spending $100 on our lunch that should have cost $40-$50.  I feel like I was ripped off. Sucks because I enjoy the patio area. Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"I luv this place .. going for a ride on fall time is very lovely  I just love their food the view ..!! Drinks are ok Bt the rest is fantastic..!!"}
{"text":"Four of us for lunch. Service excellent. Nice ambiance. Food adequate, but not great. Who batters Brussels??? Very accommodating of one persons special food needs."}
{"text":"Visited V's Taproom twice during a recent trip to the area. The first time we were there for lunch and I ordered the Southwest Chicken salad. Staff was very accommodating to substitute the crispy chicken for grilled chicken. For appetizers, our group ordered the pretzel bites humus, both tasty!The second time we were there for dinner. I ordered the blackened Mahi sandwich. Our group got two of the desserts, the chocolate chip skillet cookie ( absolutely worth every calorie) and the key lime . Both times the service was very good despite it being busy. Food was fresh and tasted good. Great happy hour specials! Definitely worth a return trip!"}
{"text":"Fantastic filet, melts in your mouth. Love the blue cheese mashed potatoes. I recommend a side of sautéed mushrooms. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to V's tonight about 7:45 pm for dinner.  It was obvious immediately that something terrible went wrong with the service.  There were plenty of people staffed but they were so poorly trained that the place was tanking.  We sat for 20 minutes waiting for someone to come by and take a drink order - or any kind if order.  The people in the booth next to us got up and left.  My husband finally grabbed an employee walking by (about the 5th time) and asked if anyone was taking care of our table.  They sent over a delightful person  that we dubbed the fixer, who jumped into action.  They sent him to another table to \"fix\" - poor guy.  Food was good, but who really cares when the service is that poor.  The manager never came by to talk to us, although he knew the situation, he left the server to take the heat.  He needs training too! They comped our meal, so we gave the cost to the fixer as a tip.  We were looking for a nice meal together, not a freeby."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed Easter brunch here yesterday.  I made reservations just a few days earlier, and they were able to accommodate us at about 1:30 pm.  At first I was worried that this might too late in the day and that the buffet might be pretty picked over, but the staff was great about replenishing every single item with new platters of food fresh from the kitchen as soon as an item began running low.  The jumbo shrimp were very good, as were the salads.  Made-to-order omelets were great and the carving station was also offering custom cuts of prime rib, plus ham, sausage, etc.  There was also a fantastic dessert bar and mimosas were a very reasonable price. Our server, Richard, was very nice--prompt and accommodating, but without getting in the way of our conversations.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great steak, service was excellent.  The fried Brussels sprouts were a great appetizer. Menu is very diverse and hard to choose- so many great options.  Great portions!"}
{"text":"Was expecting a so-so bar and grill by a golf course. Was pleasantly surprised that this place is really good! Had the fish and chips. I was worried that the batter would over power the fish, but the fish was generously portioned in each piece. I had 6 pieces of fish (all you can eat Friday) and I did not get sick from too much fried goodness. Service was on point as well . Will be back."}
{"text":"This was a first visit for us.  Having to wait for about 20 minutes we waited comfortably under the covered patio and each enjoyed a cocktail. The hostess team and bar staff were overly polite and helpful. The cocktails were made perfectly and not over priced. Once seated, we ordered and split the firecracker shrimp salad. It was good but it seemed to be missing an element or two. After watching other salads go out, we agreed to order the Kale salad next visit.  For main courses we ordered the millionaire burger and the short rib tacos. The burger was fantastic with an added grilled green chile as a topper (yum)!  The tacos were plentiful and tasty but with exception of the beans, they needed a little color on the Napa cabbage salad.  Notable that we watched many order the fried mahi fish sandwich. Our server was a little stiff and earnest but was timely. The patio scenery was beautiful, the service was almost a 5 (just shy) and the food was very good!  We will return!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast with the wife and our son. Consisted of: 2 orders chicken and waffles, side of potatoes, coffee, and oj. Waffles were fluffy and flavorful! Chicken was fried and ZERO grease on our plate from the chicken!! Potatoes were crispy, not over or under cooked!!! Service was prompt and friendly, highly recommend this breakfast gem on Saturday and Sunday's! Thanks V's team members!!!"}
{"text":"Just threw a party for my in-laws on the patio.  The staff could not have been any more gracious and the patio could not have been a more perfect location for their 50th wedding anniversary.  We appreciated all of their assistance in putting together and setting up the party.   Jaimie and Tori were particularly helpful and gracious as was Jeff. We really appreciated all of their efforts."}
{"text":"Love V's!  Menu is updated occasionally, and most everything on the menu is VERY tasty. Often busy (deservingly), especially when snow birds are in town. Beers on tap are good, but I'd like to see these updated as often as the dinner menu.  Great views of the 18th hole on the Trilogy golf course.  Beautiful patio seating for those cooler evenings. Yes, it's located just outside Trilogy, but it's not just your parent's restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is famous! For being good then bad.  At $40 per head, the Mother's Day Buffet was down towards the bottom of the bad scale.  Food was fair - the peel and eat shrimp was the best thing on the table.  But for $20, Vee Quiva served the same items plus more and the quality was, I'm told, very high.  But we go to V's because it's right here.  We'll go back, but probably just for the hamburger or the pizza.  No more Buffets for sure!"}
{"text":"This place still allows people to smoke outside while other people are eating? In 2018? Really? That's a bad move for a nice location like vistancia  but just lost my business and that's quite a bit of business get rid of the smokers keep your customers just saying will not return."}
{"text":"V's Taproom, the restaurant formerly known as Verde Grill, reminds me of a chameleon because it adapted to its changing surroundings. Change is always a gamble, but V's Taproom might have hit it right this time, because whenever we go there now, even during the week around 5-6pm, the place is crowded.   The table sets indoors have been replaced with more modern sleek ones. The entire east wall was torn down and replaced with an impressive woodfire grill for pizzas. Pizzas which were once a menu item only placed there to appease a popular need have now become part of the centerpiece of what they've evolved into. The Wild Mushroom is one of my favorites, because we all know how much I love truffles. Unfortunately, only the truffle oil is included in this pizza, but still very flavorful. The Spicy Italian follows a close second since I'm an avid meat fan. The Margherita pizza is typically my favorite at other restaurants but here, it seems to be missing something, and I can't figure it out.   The beer selection has come a long way. With beers from Belgium to Chicago to Colorado to Oregon to right here in Arizona. I'm glad to know that more are represented now compared to the selection from Verde Grill. Full Sail IPA has always been one of my favorites, and that's not biased at all even though I lived in Oregon for several years and spent many a sunny summery day in Hood River (wink, wink).   The Millionaire Burger is one of my favorite orders. You really can't go wrong with a buttered brioche bun, twice ground chuck, bacon, and cheddar which are key ingredients in my book. Add the fried egg, always.   The fish and chips is particularly good here. I like the way the fish is breaded - flaky but still with substance. I've ordered it 3 or 4 times now and sometimes to go, and the fish was cooked to my liking each time. I know, hard to mess up right? Well most places, the fish tends to be overcooked, but so far I've been lucky here.   Short rib tacos. Prepare to drink a lot of water. It tends to be salty. It's good, but not knock your socks off amazing.   We do enjoy the loaded nachos. Similar to the short rib tacos, they are good and perhaps better. The loaded nachos are an appetizer though, not an entree and the taste improves with each sip of beer. My hubby is a huge fan of them and orders them every time. My brain says, \"Eh, since they're here in front of me, I'll eat them.\"   I give kudos to V's for extending the \"signature libations\" menu. So far, and NOT all at once, I've tried the Vesper Martini, the 1792 Manhattan, Cuba Libre, the Rusty Nail, and my fav, the Old Fashioned. I don't like drinks that sweet, so I rather enjoyed these cocktails since they've made them a bit on the stronger side.   I really love the convenience factor of this restaurant, and as other patrons have mentioned, at times the place is busy, the service can get rocky like a small little fishing boat in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle. Just kidding! Okay so maybe not the Bermuda Triangle, but maybe in a Class II-III typhoon. You know.. the boat survives but barely, trucking away at its hardest. I'm rooting for V's Taproom to \"hang\" in there since it strives to be the neighborhood hangout. I think in time it will tie in its loose ends with more happy hour specials, special tasting events, and listening to feedback from not only their target audience in Vistancia, but also those that travel from beyond the 303 as well."}
{"text":"Really good food, something for everyone and nice outdoor seating. Best crispy buffalo wings! Also great and friendly service!"}
{"text":"The Food is great here as well as the atmosphere! I met the manager Matt and it turns and it turns out we grew up in the same town back in Washington State!"}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant! Great design and overlooks the golf course. This is our go to for the local eating. From breakfast to dinner, all the menu options are delish and consistently prepared every time. My favorite is the pretzels and cheese appetizer. It's so yum! The service is hit and miss, but mostly good."}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars because of the amazing patio atmosphere.  We went at 1:00 on a Monday for lunch.  We waited about 45 minutes to order.  The cook brought our food, it was fine (not great) but we still didn't even have water or our drinks.  Our waiter seemed a little slow or maybe he was drunk or hungover.  We had to continually remind him to bring our drinks, place settings, one person had no dressing on the salad and that took about 20 minutes to get.  I expected much more."}
{"text":"What can I say? We love this place. The food, service and ambiance are all great. We live close by and it's hard to find an excuse to eat anywhere else. We love the golf course views, the Brussels sprouts appetizer is our fav, and it's hard to find a better burger or salad. But the pizza is the speciality of the house. We like to pair it with a craft beer or a glass of wine for a great casual Friday night dinner. Hands down this is our favorite restaurant in the West Valley."}
{"text":"I can't wait until my house is done being built so this can be my usual hangout.  Good food and great service. My mom and I shared a burger and appetizer. I would definitely order them both again. The restaurant is a little smaller than I expected but not toooo bad. I look forward to sitting in the patio area during the cooler months. We will be back Monday to try the pizza. This place is a little perk when I go to check on the progress of my house."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here! Amazing salads and great happy hour. Best for outdoor seating!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation here for my graduation lunch. They were fantastic about accommodating our large group, including several children. The service and food were amazing and the views are beautiful too. Large portions for the kids meals. Try the tempura brussel sprouts and the herb and parmesan fries!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my husband and daughter for the first time. Ambiance was great, can't wait until it cools down to sit on the patio. I got the meatloaf and it wasn't dry at all, daughter got the filet and it was cooked perfectly with a little crunch on the outside and my husband got the prime dip (which is huge).  All we're great! Only suggestion I have is to PLEASE add a gravy option that doesn't have mushrooms. There were so many dishes we wanted to try but won't because of the mushroom gravy. Otherwise, service was great and we had a lovely time."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great views. Recently remodeled and very pleasant decor. Good appetizers, that's all we had so that's all I can comment in. Sweet local kids are a lot of the staff, good job on the hiring."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere , great place to relax, enjoy the view. Was a little disappointed in understaffing. Seem like there was only 1 waitress, 1 bartender, 1 busser and a hostess. First round of drinks came within decent amount of time. Second round took awhile as did the food but the food was worth waiting for, everything was delicious! We will definitely be making return visits!"}
{"text":"Hannah putman was amazing at getting us seated in a wonder spot on their beautiful outdoor patio tables.  I was a bit disappointed with the lack of staffing on managements part.   Our server was absolutely wonderful but extremely busy.   Along with that the kitchen does not listen to dietary requirements.   I ordered a salad wrap and asked them to leave out the chicken because I do not eat meat and I am lactose intolerant. When my wrap came out it had chicken and cheese in it. I would definitely give this place another try because it's beautiful to sit out on the patio but not super thrilled with the quality of food on the kitchens be half.   Restaurants and kitchens need to be extremely careful of dietary restrictions with all the allergies and special diets that people have these days"}
{"text":"Always good.  Like their salads and pizza.   Great setting on golf course.   Good casual menu."}
{"text":"Wood fired create ur own pizza, full bar, outdoor dining overlooking the golf course, a great menu and wine list all make for a relaxing, great evening out. Whether eating in or take out, I think we have tried everything on the menu. Never been disappointed. Whenever we consider going out, V's is always at the top of the list. Great kids menu also."}
{"text":"Shannon was terrific, not only friendly but courteous. The beer is always cold in the Tap Room. I wish they would change their menu once in awhile."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!!!  The food here is so delicious!  The burgers are great, the sandwiches and salads are delicious.  Get the parmasan fries if you get one of these---to die for!!!  The grilled salmon is wonderful!  The staff and manager were great!  What a beautiful view and a great atmosphere!!!  Thank you V's!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food & atmosphere.  Most don't realize it's open to the public. Love sitting outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Fun place to go sit outside with a great view of the golf course. Food is good and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"Great location, really great atmosphere, and has an ideal patio area! There was a group of ten of us who went there to eat, and everyone enjoyed their food, drinks, and reasonable prices! I would give it a ten, but the service was a bit sketchy. Our waitress was doing her best, but I think it was extremely busy and the bar was a little slow. Nothing that would keep me from coming back, though, and we will!!!!  Delightful place, for sure."}
{"text":"Great place. The prime rib is my favorite of all. Awesome atmosphere and great service. My kids likes to go and hang out at the pizza station. They always give them little dough balls to play with. Been there quite a few times with family and friends and not 1 complaint. Except for the long wait times lol"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit out to V's. I really wish that we had more daylight to enjoy the patio area and view of the golf course. What 20 or so minutes we had of daylight was very beautiful. We were seated outside on a warm and comfortable January evening. With our drinks we really liked the pretzel bites with the beer infused cheese sauce. Very, very good. Nice spongy and light pretzels, not chewy like some bites tend to be. There was nine of us for dinner so we had a few of the menu items and everyone was happy. My husband and I split the meatloaf because I wasn't all that hungry after the beers and appys. But I am so glad we did. The portion on the meatloaf is HUGE!!!  It has a bourbon ketchup glaze that was really tasty, not too sweet. A mound of crispy  fried onion  and top all nestled into a very large portion of mashed potatoes. It was really delicious. Two ladies ordered the roasted chicken and the waitress came back to let us know it had been sold out. So she offered them a grilled chicken breast instead. They actually got two breast portions each and took half of the meal home. We all joked that everyone should have shared. The food is wonderful, I would love to come back earlier in the day so that I can enjoy the patio before dark. There was a few large groups of families there and the service seemed really good for as busy as they were that night."}
{"text":"Always delicious. Always prompt friendly service  Always busy(which is a good sign). Great outdoor setting on the golf course."}
{"text":"Place has horrible service. They don't seem to care. We waited forever to order only to have our order \"forgotten\" by the server. We reordered and the food was somewhat tasty. It's the only decent place around so I hope they do better."}
{"text":"We stopped in Friday early evening for their happy hour after hearing this was the neighborhood hang. We are in the process of building in Vistancia and this was recommended to us by the community so we figured we'd swing in after a meeting.   The ambience is absolutely stunning. It's set right on the golf course with beautiful views and waterfall features to really set the mood. We were seated immediately out on the covered patio since it was a beautiful day out.   They have a pretty decent happy hour with specials on drinks and appetizers so we indulged in that. We split the pretzel bits with cheese which was a huge portion for the money. The pretzels were toasted and the cheese was really good. My husband got the wings which he said were decent but nothing out of this world. I got the margarita pizza and the crust was nice and crispy. Wasn't anything extraordinary but it hit the spot.   All in all, for this being the only restaurant in the immediate area I think there is room for improvement. The menu is a bit small so I would love to see that expanded. The beer selection was decent but I would love to see more craft beer selections. We will definitely try this place again though."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the reason for my 5-star rating is the service!  We sat in the bar for lunch and Shannon waited on us.  She was awesome!!  Made great drinks and even made me a small drink using grapefruit vodka because she wanted me to try it.  Try the burgers!!  Yummmm"}
{"text":"What a great experience atmosphere is awesome and the servers are extremely friendly thank you Lynn for taking great care of us! We will be back!"}
{"text":"we visit here a couple of times every year while in town visiting family at the neighboring community.  so while I may not be a regular I have been here about 4 times or so.  enough to provide my insight.  I have a different expectation for what a \"taproom\" is due to living in Portland, Oregon but this is what I wood expect for a place in it's location.  They have very mainstay beers that you'll find pretty much anywhere.  Would be nice to see more local handles up there given the newness of the AZ Brewing scene.  IPA is limited to Full Sail, an ok selection if all that's there and available.  Patio is fantastic!  Views for days.  They have seating outside that opens up to the inside bar which is pretty cool.  Heat lamps for the cooler desert nights.  Staff in my opinion has always been great.  Attentive, not pushy, seem to know the menu well.  Chad behind the bar seems to run the show and as he should.  Dude is really good at what he does.  Certainly an asset to that team there.  Food is quite solid.  I've had the millionaire burger with egg a couple of times now and it's been quite tasty.  Certainly large, maybe too large and I'm a decent sized guy.  Deep fried brussel spouts are a mainstay and very well done and I hate brussel sprouts so if we can get me to buy into them you're preparing them right.  Fish in chips was well prepared, not greasy, good size pieces of fish.  Not the greatest, but far from bad.  Arizona isn't exactly where one goes for \"todays catch\" anyhow.  If I lived in the NW Valley I'd certainly make V's a regular stop - without a doubt if I lives in Vistancia area (which I wouldn't mind doing, damn houses are cheap)."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. We had a problem with a dish that we didn't care for and even though we called out they made us another one. They even threw on fresh fries which was unexpected. Great customer service! Thanks."}
{"text":"Unique menu selections in a fun little atmosphere, especially if you can sit outside. A small little neighborhood eaterie that isn't a cookie cutter chain restaurant like all the rest. Food is made well, not what you see everywhere else, and worth the higher menu prices for the variety, quality and tastiness you find here. Right on the golf course, breakfast is weekends only."}
{"text":"The Friday all you can eat fish fry is outstanding. The restaurant used big chunks of fresh mahi mahi for the fish and chips. This is one of the best 'fish and chips' you will  find in the Valley...sit outdoors during the cooler weather and enjoy."}
{"text":"My family and I normally LOVE V's, but we had the worst experience with a hostess tonight! We were hungry for an early dinner so we thought we'd order pick up. After calling twice with NO ANSWER, we thought it must be busy so we decided to make the short drive down there and place our order in person. However, when we got there it was very quiet. We walked in and waited for about 5 minutes before taking a seat on the inside benches because we hadn't been helped. After another 5 minutes went by so I had to get up and ask a bartender for the hostess so we could place a to-go order. The bartender looked confused and said she would go get her. Finally, the bartender brought a hostess named Valerie up to the front. We realized then that our phone calls hadn't been answered because Valerie wasn't at the host stand to answer the phone. Valerie seemed really out of it and took our order with a big frown on her face :( So we placed our order, but our food took quite a while to come out considering it was very quiet and we only ordered two things. Valerie checked her cell phone multiple times while we were waiting. Food was great as usual, though. Overall it took close to two hours from the time we made the first phone call to the time we were handed our food. Very disappointed in the service this afternoon since we love this restaurant so much!! :("}
{"text":"Nice place and attentive service. I understand you are in a retirement community, but some seasoning on the food would work wonders. Your roasted chicken was awesome but the mashed potatoes were disgusting."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, it is summer and the bar had about 6 customers, 2 of them regulars and drunks. The lady talked at full volume to everyone in the building. I got the impression these people go there ever night and feel the world is better because of it. I for one will not be returning until the birds come back and there is enuf ambient noise to drown these people out. Not sure what V's should do differently other than stop serving drunks."}
{"text":"Very good service and great tasting food. There skillet baked cookies and pizzas are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Hopeful to find a place in the Northwest Valley that didn't scream restaurant chain, my husband and I tried V's for an impromptu happy hour date. We ordered a Dutch Mule which was refreshing as well as the Brussels sprout app and the loaded potatoes croquette to share. The sprouts were disappointing as they came in a tempura batter. The majority of the plate was deep fried tempura batter that had fallen off the sprout. The potatoes were quite bland but palatable. I ordered the  Millionaire burger that really shouldn't cost more than $8. The beef was unseasoned, cooked less than requested and topped with a slab of shiny processed cheddar cheese. The Parmesan herb fries were a close second to a generic grocery store brand with shaker parm sprinkles on top. Pretty boring.  The Mac and cheese my husband got was presented nicely in a cast iron skillet but again was lackluster and tasteless. We would of loved to drown our sorrows in another mule.............if the waitress had offered us another round. Not worth the money or the drive if you don't live in Vistancia. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My favorite meal is the grilled salmon plate it comes on top of risotto which i think is hard to find in the valley. Also tried the fried brussels sprouts which were bomb! went very well with the tap room sauce. very relaxing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We were alittle disappointed with our food at first (it was a very busy night), but Jeff the manager fixed our order right away and served us with excellent customer service. I would definitely eat here again and recommend this place to family and friends. Thanks again Jeff! You saved the day!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is great and the atmosphere is nice, offering up views of the beautiful golf course.  I highly recommend the tacos in addition to any of the pizzas.  Amazing!  All of the food that I have tried has been good.  The inside bar is a little small and usually very crowded, but you can always sit outside and enjoy your drinks next to the golf course and water fountains.  The clientele is a little on the old side because it is located within the adult/retirement community of Trilogy, but because I'll be there one day, I could care less.  Its nice to see old people staying young.  In the winter time, when snowbirds return, this place is constantly packed so call first and be patient.  I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"The pizza is EXCELLENT here! Highly recommended for pizza lovers (which means everybody!)  Our meal started off with an appetizer; spinach artichoke dip. Overall, we thought it was too creamy for that sort of dip. It seemed to me to be packed with fatty ingredients because afterwards I felt extremely full (which usually is due to fatty foods). However, we still liked it, just thought it could be better prepared differently. The menu said the chips that came with it were made in house, but we couldn't taste the difference.   We had create your own pizzas for our main course. It was a great price ($9 with two toppings, $1/ extra topping). I ordered sausage, spinach, and pepperoni. My girlfriend ordered sausage, red onion, olives, and prosciutto. The one thing that put this pizza on the map was the SAUSAGE! It had a delicious, fresh taste to it. Also, we both thought the sauce was savory as well. It was on the sweeter side, which we both enjoyed. Other notes, the crust was thin and very crispy, the cheese wasn't overbearing, and it was a big pizza for the price.  We also had drinks. I had the Oak Creek Nut Ale. That had a sweet taste to it which paired nicely with my pizza. My girlfriend tried the white tap wine and didn't like it, but then ordered an Australian red wine that she enjoyed.  It was a slow night, but the service was good. They generously pour the glasses of wine (seemed like a 2 for 1). Also I appreciated the manager coming over to ask us how our dinner was."}
{"text":"We love this hidden gem in Vistancia. Nice, clean atmosphere. Attentive, great customer service. Delicious food. It has quickly become one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Comfy spot, and pretty lively for being out of the way. Good food that is not expensive, and good views of the golf course. Cobb salad is sizable as is chicken salad wrap."}
{"text":"The French dip is my all time favorite thing on their menu. It's huge so I usually share this with a salad. I love their view and it's never too crowded.  They always have good beers on tap and great selection of wine."}
{"text":"Food is pretty darn good here but the key about this place is that is usually is not busy so you are not waiting forever for breakfast.  I don't think we have come here for dinner yet but we did a Mother's Day Brunch last year.  The place is upscale golf lounge bar and restaurant with decent service.  I love that we have a nice place nearby without a long wait.  Prices are steep but that is expected and glad it has been supported.  Highly recommend stopping by and checking it out."}
{"text":"Went here on Thursday. There were 12 of us for lunch after golf. Staff was super. Made you feel comfortable and like you were the only one there.  Food very good and fresh. A great selection of beverages. I will return."}
{"text":"Had my mother n laws retirement party on the back patio. The staff and food were awesome! Very accommodating. Will use again for sure."}
{"text":"We have been to V's a number of times. We have had a couple of less than enjoyable experiences and have avoided eating there because of these. We decided to try again since the restaurant is in our neighborhood and the food offerings are different than many others in the area. Larry was our server and provided great service. My husband ordered a patty melt that was cooked exactly as he ordered it. My Greek salad was very good.our food was served in a timely manner and Larry checked back with us several times. We were pleasantly surprised and will return."}
{"text":"Good food great views nice staff friendly staff. I'd only suggest they use a cod instead of a mahi mahi for the fish n chips?"}
{"text":"I had dinner here on Saturday night with friends. The restaurant has a casual atmosphere. We arrived at 6:00 and the place was busy. There was a 30-40 minute wait, but we noticed there were available tables both inside and out. We were told that the open tables were being held for customers with reservations. I get that. If I showed up and learned my table was not available I would go into my Seinfeld \"you can take a reservation, but you can't hold a reservation\" routine. So, that was okay. But, when we were finally seated, the hostess took us inside and there were open tables outside (our preference). When challenged, she told us it would be a longer wait but then hastily took us to a table on the patio. I thought she could have handled this better. Even when we left, there were still open tables! I recommend making a reservation to avoid being treated like a second class citizen.  My dinner was quite good. I ordered the V's Meatloaf. It was a thick slice of meatloaf served with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and topped with thin, fried onion straws. The meatloaf had a good flavor, and the mushroom gravy was spot on. The portion was huge, and I was stuffed after finishing almost all of it. The meatloaf and a Kilt Lifter beer were a good pairing. Kilt Lifter is a brown ale  from a local microbrewery. My friends ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and Basil Chicken Pasta, and they both were pleased with their choices.  Overall, a nice experience. V's offers a good variety of entrees, and very reasonable prices. The bar is probably a good stop after a round on the Trilogy golf course."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a girlfriend.  I had the shrimp scampi pomodoro which was very good. The shrimp were huge and very tender. My friend had the prime rib french dip which she said was the best she has had in years. Our server, Larry, was very attentive. We sat on the patio which was very inviting with misters around the edges and overlooked the waterfall. It was a soothing and enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"V's is a great place to enjoy cocktails, appetizers and a meal with friends.  They have a great happy hour daily and the staff is very helpful and friendly every time we go. If you're in the neighborhood, it's definitely a place worth stopping by and checking out."}
{"text":"It's OK Breakfast stops at 11:30am on weekends. No hash brown patotes, no waffles Nice meeting place"}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. Husband has been in twice in last 2 weeks to get food to go . He sits in the bar and wants a drink both times while waiting for food and BOTH times is ignored by bartender and has to complain to Manager! Both times his beer is comped! Today while he was ignored....both Manager AND bartender were watching NCAA Final Four!!! He had to interrupt them!!!! Wow!!!! Food was good on a positive note!!!! Can't wait till V's has more competition out here in regards to restaurants!!!! It's coming!!!!! Quesadillas were good as usual so I'll give you 3 stars for that instead of the 2 stars I was going to give!!!!"}
{"text":"My sister loves this place. And we hadn't been. So it was a no-brained for Xmas Eve lunch.   We sat in the patio, watching the ducks & the golfers. Gorgeous setting.   When lunch arrived - WOW!  My daughter's wood fired pizza was beautiful & she enjoyed every bite. My salad had the largest, and best tasting, chicken breast I'd ever seen.   The service was spot on.  My sister says she always makes a reservation & I see why.   If you're looking for a lovely setting, casual dress spot with amazing food...eat here."}
{"text":"this was my first visit and we really enjoyed it it was Saturday night and the place was very busy and my only complaint was the service was quite slow. Great waitress, but could not tell if she just had too many tables. That was my only negative comment. The food was outstanding! I had the chicken fried chicken and it was tender, moist, and just great. My wife had that short rib tacos and she said they were out of this world. Our friends had the prime rib and they agreed it was perfect and very tender. The place has outstanding drinks and just a great atmosphere on the outside patio. We will return there again for sure and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food at V's is pretty good, but a bit overpriced and they don't have a great wine selection, but it's close to Vistancia and isn't a typical chain - plus it has an amazing patio on the golf course!!  Great place to hang out with friends.  Go for Happy Hour and it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm not going to say never again until I eat in the dining room. We sat at a booth in the bar area and that's a mistake. Management needs to assign a server to handle those sitting in the bar area. Instead they leave serving to the two bar tenders. It's way too busy at the bar for them to pay the necessary attention and it showed. Cold food, wait wait wait for everything. My goodness it took 15 minutes to pay."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. Once for a family dinner and then for a Thanksgiving brunch. I love this restaurant. It is so cozy and cute. The food is pretty delicious. The only small issue I had was with the wait time, but sometimes you need to wait for your food to be made perfectly and I'm okay with that. If you have no plans for thanksgiving, think about making reservations here. They have all the classics and plenty of it. Guess what? You don't even have to clean up afterwards! It's amazing."}
{"text":"1st time at this establishment last night. The whole family really enjoyed the nice scenery, and we can only imagine how nice it must be when the temperatures are nicer. We sat out on the patio last night, and between the misters and the ceiling fans it was very nice. The service was very good. The food was surprisingly also really good. I recommend the short rib tacos. My wife and daughter shared the millionaire burger, which they really enjoyed but felt it could have used a little more seasoning. My other daughter had the oriental chicken salad. She really liked it, but needed to ask for extra salad dressing since it was a little dry. We were really pleasantly surprised and will make this a staple in our list of favorite restaurants. The prices were reasonable, and they have a full bar. Also, it's an OK place for kids, but not really little ones. There really isn't much to capture their attention, other than being able to run around the perimeter of the golf course. Good Job, keep it up and we will be back for ourselves and family/friends."}
{"text":"We have always had a great experience here. The food here is delicious. The baked brussel sprouts are something I've never tried before coming here, and I must say that it must be the BEST way to prepare brussel sprouts! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the food and they have good craft beer. I come here when I visit my parents who live in Trilogy. They have a little bit of everything on the menu and I've never had anything I didn't like. The pretzel bites with cheese as an appetizer are my favorite though."}
{"text":"I recently moved here from Toon North , I am pleased I stopped by, the view and ambiance was exactly what I wanted, the lunch menu had a great balance of naughty and nice . Service miss Vanda was fantastic polite and super attentive . I am definitely coming back. I am also interested to see what it's like when the sun goes down, how magical will it be? Hopefully find out soon ."}
{"text":"Love this place! Close to home and their pizza is amazing!! They have amazing views if you sit outside, with pretty water fountains! Definitely one of our favorite places to go and relax."}
{"text":"This is one of a few times Yelp let me down. I have to start by saying the service we had here was by far the worst I've experienced in a long time. My wife and I arrived here with friends around 8 PM on a Wednesday night. The place was half full. Our server took our drink and appetizer orders. She returned ten minutes later bringing us our drinks and taking our dinner order. The appetizers came with our dinner forty five minutes after we ordered dinner. I had ordered the Reuben Sandwich. The sandwich was just okay but it's hard to tell based on my state of mind at the time. As far as appetizers which didn't quite get eaten we had ordered the  pretzel bites which more than likely probably came out of a box from Sams Club. They were simply just tiny rolls and exhibited no pretzel like qualities at all. The second appetizer was the chips and dip with the nacho dip. These also tasted as though someone went through all of the trouble of pulling them from a bag and a jar. We never had our drinks refilled and it took another ten minutes to obtain our check. All in all  our party was there for about three hours due to the incredibly poor service. The only way I will ever eat here again is if I were to play golf at Trilogy and get outvoted by a contingent of my foursome seeking convenience. I will say the one beer which was Full Sail was pretty good."}
{"text":"I'm a resident of Vistancia. We just got to V's for breakfast 10 minutes after they stop serving breakfast. Every single person surrounding us is eating breakfast and they refuse to service because we are a bit late. We have a baby and now we have to pack her in and go somewhere else it is very frustrating. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place! Consistently great food. I have never had a bad meal here.  The managers are great and are ever present. The bartenders are very friendly and the Chef's are amazing! The golf course and management aren't so bad either!"}
{"text":"Overall very pleased with this place. We did run into a small hiccup but after several minutes of discussions it was handled. We had a large 15 person party table reserved and when we got their they tried to sit us in 2 separate tables rather than 1 large table. They stated that it was their policy that they don't seat tables larger than 12 and would split. No one told us that on The oh be when reservations were made. That being said, they assisted and allowed the long large table.   Outside of that, our server did pretty well considering our group size. Moscow mule was a bit on the sweeter side but good and reasonably priced.  I had the millionaire burger and it was good. You have to get the parmesan and garlic fries. Super good.  Everything's as good and reasonably priced. But if a drive but good experience.   4 star instead of 5 simply because of the problem with seating."}
{"text":"I went to V's on a Saturday night about an hour before closing. The restaurant was not very busy yet it took over 5 minutes to get a server to our table to order drinks. It took another 15-20 for her to come back and check on us to order dinner. Once ordered, it took nearly 45 minutes for it to come out. My spouse and I ordered the Millennium Burger and it was good. The server took too long to come back and check on us, so I waved down another server to get us ranch of whom forgot - we also had a chance to ask our server for ranch as well, who also forgot. Finally I flagged down another server who got right on it. Overall, the food tasted fine, but the service was really, really slow and inattentive."}
{"text":"We recently moved to the area and went to V's Taproom for dinner and a few drinks tonight. We sat outside and it was beautiful. The ambience is laid back and the view over the golf course is amazing. Took a while to get our food but our server didn't ignore us and kept bringing drinks. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We come to V's a lot.  I'm so glad our little neighborhood spot has great food, great service and the outside patio with views of the golf course are .  My hubby loves the pizza and I love the pasta with the short ribs."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided that we would have this years New Year's Eve dinner at V's. We have dined there numerous times in the past and have always found the food and service to be excellent. New Year's Eve was unbelievable. From the moment we arrived and were seated until we left we were treated as if we were the only patrons in the restaurant. Our waiter, although very busy never missed stopping by our table to check to see if we needed anything. However, the highlight of the evening had to be the four-course dinner. We both agreed the food was the BEST that we have had since we arrived in Arizona over sixteen years ago. The appetizers, soup, steak, lobster tail and deserts can only be described as HEAVENLY. We were fortunate enough to speak with the Chef who had stopped by our table to check on us and to see if the dinner was satisfactory. We both told him that the dinner was outstanding and we were so happy that we had chosen V's for our special dinner. I am sure that he could tell from our reactions we were very, very happy that we had chosen V's. We will be back next New Year's Eve."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here for dinner several times and it is always excellent across the board. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with even better service with Dean. It was a little slow so Dean was very helpful in our selection and with the neighborhood. We are relocating and also looking for a good place to eat and drink . After speaking  with Dean we now know that this will be our steady place to come quite often. Nice to know there are still 19 year olds with good work ethics can can carry a conversa"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, and if I could give this place 10 stars, I would... (so much better than it was 7 years ago).  I love the staff, the atmosphere, and the menu is great - love the rotating menu and specials offered, particularly their fish and chips ---  It competes with PNW fish and chips...completely delish!!!   Pizza bar is fun and pretty tastey too!  And they seem to always be looking for great wines to add to their cellar.  You take care of them, and they *really* take care of you - ~!  Elise, Toni and Matt were among our favs who always went above and beyond for us!!!  Great for family too!  Miss coming here now that we've moved out of state, but plan to visit again when in town.  Sitting outside is lovely and relaxing, and they do have misters if you are not a fan of the heat and heaters if you don't like to be cold.  lol."}
{"text":"Excellent thin crust. Pizza and wine four two for o lunch w0 bucks.  And they served the wine in a crafe with gave us each 2 glasses full.  Someone else wrote no vegetarian food but I've had the kale chopped salad and it was great.  It's always crowded even in off season I'd say that's a positive vote with people's dollars that this place is great."}
{"text":"Shannon is a blast and one of the reasons we come here.   Food is great and love the patio atmosphere"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good place, considering it mostly exists to serve the nearby neighborhood.  Super busy, but we were lucky enough to be seated on the patio.  I was happy with the range of beers on tap, and everyone at the table had good food.  We have friends in the neighborhood, so I can pretty confidently say that I'll be back on another visit to AZ."}
{"text":"Great spot. The food was really good, fries were excellent. They have a great patio overlooking the golf course. Seems like it would be a chill spot to watch a football game too"}
{"text":"I guess it was ok for the price. Nothing to write home about. I had to keep asking for coffee, a spoon , and felt like I was a bother. My husband's pancake was ice cold. Going to give it another try at a different time of day."}
