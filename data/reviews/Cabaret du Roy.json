{"text":"Service cordial et convivial. Très bon emplacement au pied du marché Bonsecours avec une belle terrasse. Décors taverne médiévale et costume typique pour les serveurs."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to if you would like to experience French Canadian culinary culture of the 17XX. The food is amazing and the service and the theme sets the stage for true feeling of 18th century. I loved this place."}
{"text":"Great place.  Even if you Order the meager portions you will be stuffed!  Great entertaining evening better than the $100 horsetail steakhouse we went to the night before!  This was much more fun.  Bye the way you don't need to get the 5 course meal.  Their portions are filling.  Have the maple whisky!  Great place whether you are a tourist or a local!"}
{"text":"I'd put more a 4.5 star on this... I went there last year for the birthday of my friend. I had a friend from cooking with I went with that had work there for quite sometime. He told me the food was good however a bit price. In the Bonsecour Market (Marché Bonsecour) this place is IN the tourist spot. It's a culinary experience in a Nouvelle-France (New-France) decor. The services is done in old costume as well as in Old French. The tourist will be charm by the music, the complicity and the fact they scream at each other without breaking the Etiquette of Table manners. ;)  even if they don't get a word of what they say their act is fun and entertaining.  There're Table d'Hôte menus and À la Carte menu. Both are quite expensive. The food is well done, recipes were search by owner to fit a Nouvelle-France Menu and adapted. The biggest issue is that it's a bit expensive. I had the biggest Table d'Hote menu, couldn't finish my meal 'cause I had made a raid on the exquisite homemade bread earlier and drank 2 pitchers of Cider. So make sure you're hungry and if you bring your kids,  maybe get the À la carte menu because a Table d'hote will most likely be too much. My tab? 5 pitchers of cider, a Trou Normand (Calvados), most expensive meals of the menu ; 230$ with tip.  Normal people: 70$ per person"}
{"text":"Nous avons testé le Cabaret pour un déjeuner. Je n'aurais donc pas le loisir de vous parler de la partie concert/spectacle. Bien que nous avons été accueillis par des femmes déguisées en pirates, toutes deux fort gracieuses et au langage soutenu ! Elles ont joué le jeu tout au long de notre repas !   Les décors (grandes tables en bois, latrines, accessoires...) ont également contribué à nous mettre dans l'ambiance ! Bien qu'il faisait un poil sombre, la salle reproduisant un éclairage à la bougie !  Au menu de jour là : poulet sauce aux canneberges accompagné de légumes et frites, en dessert croustine aux pommes (crumble), et le repas était servi avec du pain aux bleuets glacé au sirop d'érable. Verdict : on a plutôt bien mangé !"}
