{"text":"Great service and really delicious pub fare. It is a nice atmosphere that is bright and clean. 

The wedge fries with Parmesan cheese were so good- and they were piping hot when they were brought to the table. My chicken fingers were perfectly crisp and did not disappoint. My French fries, however, sadly came out cold. 

The waitress was very attentive and brought us many sauces and was on top of refills without us having to ask. 

This was a great find in the east end! We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent garlic shrimp; not over-cooked and tasty without being salty.  Brochette is crisp with refreshing toppings. Salads crisp and fresh. Spaghetti is a huge portion with much more sauce than I like; meatballs are bite sized and have a lot of breadcrumbs in them. Grilled chicken breast is not pre-packaged pub fair, it's a full chicken breast with lemony grilled flavour. The clubhouse has grilled chicken breast, not slices of deli-style chicken, and is well-assembled. The fries are previously frozen but cooked well so they are crisp and they arrived hot."}
{"text":"This is a local Cheers bar with great food. Nice setting, you can bring the kids or your pals and you'd fit in! And, of course, you won't miss your sport!"}
{"text":"We have been to Frog and Crown on a number of occasions and have never been disappointed.  Food is always fresh and well prepared. Service is attentive and very pleasant.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice clean restaurant. The food portion was large and the taste was pretty good. I had the veal parmagiana with pasta and was quite impressed for a bar/restaurant."}
