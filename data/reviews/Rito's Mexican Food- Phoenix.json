{"text":"I've been eating Rito's since I was a little girl. My mom and I would go pick up my older sister from work and on the way home grab some burritos for dinner. We would get all different kinds including the red chile, green chile, bean burritos and occasionally tostadas and tacos. We'd head home to my dad coming from work and my 2 sisters, brother, my mom, dad and I would half up the burritos between us sharing and delighting in the food.  My sister we would pick up has now passed. Towards the end of her battle with cancer all she wished for was a burrito from Rito's. I live in California currently and no other place has held a candle to Rito's in my heart. Because of the wonderful childhood memories I have of this place and for always being so friendly and being consistently good I give Rito's 5 stars and a heart. My sister I'm sure would agree"}
{"text":"Really nothing to write home about. I had a burrito with shredded beef, beans, and cheese and it came out to $8.30. No drink. Pretty pricey for something so basic. Like I said taste wasn't anything special.   The place was nice for taking place in the middle of the hood.  I thought mi abuela was going take my order. Hence 3 stars instead of 2."}
{"text":"The best green chili burrito enchilada style ever!!! Period. I never like red enchilada sauce, usually too bland for me, but not here, it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!.. Green chili burrito is the BEST! Tacos are great. Everything is fresh and made to order. And the beans - oh those are like crack- once you try them you are hooked and crave your bean fix. This is a place everyone who loves Mexican food should try. Don't be scared of the area, you will be okay."}
{"text":"I only recently found out that this place is near me, because id been driving all the way to litos on 47th ave and olive. I was so disappointed. The green mix Burro had zero flavor from neither the green chili or the beans (which were runny and gross), and if this burro did have any meat in it, i never found it. I am so let down, because it is sooo much closer. I guess thats what i get for betraying litos. Will never come back."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere. Walking into an old house with bars on the windows just screams \"Mexican food made by angels\". The tacos are always killer with fresh meat and delicious cheese. The shells are always freshly fried and made to order.   The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the anxiety I get when I walk in. It's cramped, busy, and slightly warmer than it is outside. I have pretty bad anxiety so I have to be in the right mood to go here. But it is always worth it."}
{"text":"I went to Ritos expecting that I would love it, I have other friends that swear by this place and we have pretty similar taste. They had been telling me for months to go try out Ritos, so one afternoon I finally dragged myself over there. I went between 11 -  12 and there was no line and just a few people outside, I ordered a burrito aaaaand MEH. I don't get it, it wasn't a very good burrito. It wasn't bad or anything, but I didn't really enjoy it and almost didn't want to finish it. I told my friends this and they disowned and vowed to never talk to me again. I decided I better try to save my friendships and make sure my taste buds didn't die or something so I went to Carolinas the next day and their food was amazing as usual. So apparently something is wrong with me because I don't think Ritos is the greatest ever and now my friends won't ever talk to me again. I might go back to try Ritos again someday, but only because I value my friendships..."}
{"text":"this will be short and sweet....  GREEN CHILE BURRO ENCHILADA STYLE  It absolutely does not get any better than Rito's - and yes, as mentioned by others, they do still on occassion make tacos - but they really are not needed when they have the best  GREEN CHILE BURRO ENCHILADA  STYLE  in town."}
{"text":"One star is being generous. This place is really a joke. The service was horrible. We asked the guy that help us what type of meats the had and he said because they are a small business they only offer beef. Wasn't very informative of what came in certain dishes. After we ordered we asked for an horchata for the kids he said they didn't sell that. Now what kind of Mexican joint doesn't sell horchata. Then we asked for a cup of iced water the guy said we don't have ice water either. There was no place to sit and eat inside and eating outside was out of the question being that it was 100+ degrees outside. We took out food home. When trying to eat the burrito the whole thing fell apart. I don't know what kind of circus this place is running. I didn't even get to taste the food because it was all over the floor from the cheap a55 tortilla they used. F@ck this place. Get your sh!t together"}
{"text":"Oh Rito's, how you haunt me.  I know you're not good for me.  You're really not working with my intentions of \"getting into shape\" and \"eating better.\"    Oh well, you are so delicious.    Rito's is a cute little hole in the wall in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  In my younger, less adventurous years I wouldn't have stopped here.  I would have missed out.  They only have a few options - red chile vs green chile, burrito vs chimi, rice and beans or no.  That pretty much covers it.  But what they lack in variety, they make up for in quality.  It's gooey, cheesy and delicious.  My personal favorite which I get nearly every time is the green chile chimi enchilada style.  If you don't know, enchilada style means smothered in sauce and cheese.  Sure it's messy, but it doesn't get any tastier.  Don't believe there is indoor seating, so you are left either taking it to-go or sitting on their outdoor patio.  That's all well and good when it is 70 degrees out.  But 100+ with humidity?  I'll take mine to go for now.    Definitely worth a try if you enjoy mexican food.  My only other complaint is that they close early (4pm, I believe) so dinner is not an option."}
{"text":"Oh man, this is so good. But everything is full of lard.  I leave here every time with a huge stomach and go home and take a nap for a few hours afterwards.   But so so good."}
{"text":"They do have the best HOT smothered green chili burrito in Phoenix! The chicken tacos are also to die for!"}
{"text":"They have a limited menu and limited hours but Rito's makes for a fantastic lunch.  There is a small building wherein you order, wait for and pick up your food.  At this point you either drive off or eat on the patio which features picnic tables and a couple trees that provide some shade and leaves.  But that isn't important, the food is what keeps drawing me back.  As other reviewers have mentioned, their tender, seasoned beef is top notch.  Both the red chili and green chili sauces are rich and tasty; I prefer the red but I still usually get the red sauce inside and the green sauce outside.  The beans - kind of half mashed - are nice seasoned as well and make an excellent side."}
{"text":"Ritos, you make damn good burritos!  I FINALLY made it down to Ritos on a day off several months back.  I had been hearing about this place from a friend who works downtown and frequently stops in for lunch.  Unfortunately for me I work in North Scottsdale and this place is only open M-F during lunch hours.   Ritos is pretty much a hole in the wall.  The screen door entrance in a neighborhood setting makes you wonder if you have the right place or will be walking in on a family sitting in their living room watching television.  There is no seating inside and only a few options on the menu.  I ordered the green chili burrito with rice and beans which was one of the best I've ever had.  The meal had probably about 2,000 calories and was worth every bite!  There is picnic table seating outside which would be perfect this time of year...summer, not so much.  One day, I will return again!    Suggestion - at least be open even for just a little bit on Saturday or Sunday...pretty please?!"}
{"text":"I made the plunge to come here after reading so many yelpers give thsi place 5 stars.  Well, I give it only three.  As a Phoenix native (45 years old) I have eaten my share of red/green chile burritos.  The ones at Rtio's are good, but not so exceptional to take the reins of best.  And, at $8 for a red chile burro enchilada style, it isn't so good to compensate for the cost.  I consider this kind of Mexican food peasant food, that is food that is inexpensive, that the poor could afford and enjoy.  $8 ain't it.  Look to Carolina's for a better value in this regard.  Does anybody remember La Tortillaria run by AZ foods on Washington?  That was a good burrito.  Rito's is good, not exceptional.  Rito's is expensive.  I wouldn't recommend this place over any other standard red or green chile joint nor would I discourage it.  Just be aware you will pay a pretty good sum for something that  tastes good, but is priced a little too high.  Final note:  Red and green chile is a very simple dish to make at home, and is very, very inexpensive.  A restarurant that charges more than $3 bucks is making a huge amount of profit on their dishes."}
{"text":"I love the green burro. I used to order it enchilada style, but this time I didn't and there is so much sauce inside I was happy with it as it was. I don't think I'd go really far out of my way to eat here, but if you're in the neighborhood it's worth stopping in."}
{"text":"Rito's never disappoints me or my family that has been going here for years!!!!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Rito's, my coworker and I happily drove off, chatting about how we couldn't wait to get back to the office to finally see what all the fuss is about.  Well we truly could NOT wait. We had to pull in at the parking lot of a church, not one block away from there because the aroma was just too much! Honest!  Rito's wouldn't be as fun without the Soup-Nazi attitude of the people running the joint.  I think it's hilarious. It's a Phoenix landmark and a MUST for out-of-towners.  And they CAN be that way to us. They can require cash only. Make you keep your mouth shut unless ordering EXACTLY what is on the VERY LIMITED menu and nothing more.  As far as ordering goes, I ought to add that the word \"ordering\" is misleading. We don't \"order\" our lunch at Rito's. We request.  These people are serious and so am I. I want my bean/cheese/enchilada style and I will do whatever it takes to get it. Don't come with me and get an attitude with them or I'll rip your head off. I will NOT be 86ed from Ritos on account of you! But you can cry on my shoulder as I wolf down my burrito. I understand.  Only thing I want to correct, which I think is unfair in some other reviews: the neighborhood isn't as bad as people like to say. Yeah there is gang activity, but come on. When was the last time some innocent person just getting their lunch was assaulted or shot in the Garfield neighborhood?  Can't remember? That's because the trouble makers usually make trouble for themselves and each other and don't usually bother the rest of us.   Bottom line, if you can't handle central phoenix, stick with your local tacobell/pizzahut/kentuckyfriedchicken drive thru in anthem."}
{"text":"Nobody does GREEN CHILIE like these guys. Im tellin ya, get extra salsa with your burro. And the tacos are very full of meat. They are NOT stingy with the meat."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, and is one of the reasons I love Yelp.  I would have never found this place otherwise, even if you spotted me the square mile that it's located in.  It's the ultimate hole-in-the-wall, and the best Mexican food I've ever eaten.  I have some thrilling news to share.  THERE IS ANOTHER RITO'S (opened by the son of the owner).  It's every bit as good and may be more convenient for you.  It's at 51st Ave. and Orangewood - Rito's Burritos in the little strip mall.  Naturally I tested the green chile burro enchilada style and it was exactly the same, right down to the oversized pie plate.  Ahhh...  Don't worry, for those that are concerned Rito's is going corporate, the new place still has those stylish iron bars between you and the kitchen, and although it has bathrooms, they are perpetually \"under repair,\" according to the glossy, pre-printed sign they've mounted on the wall.  And of course it's still cash-only.  So they have preserved that special charm.   I know this will make the line longer at the new place, but it would be unfair not to share the good news, especially when I learned about the original from here.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I lived in phx for 40 years. This place is simply the best in phx. Calling your order in advance is a must."}
{"text":"Travelled from Toronto on a business conference. Found this restaurant on yelp and decided to check it out. Place has little to no signage to let you know it is there. If it weren't for my GPS I would've had a hard time finding it. It is in what seems like a lower income neighbourhood, but the people are fine. Cashier was VERY nice.  I ordered the Red Chilli Burrito Enchalada Style. It was pretty good. It was basically 3 layers of tortilla stuffed with diced chicken or steak then covered with a thin layer of cheese. Tasted pretty good. The chilli sauce was not overly spicy, just enough to get the taste buds going. All in all a good experience  P.S. I will going back tomorrow for a chimichanga :)"}
{"text":"Well.  WOW.  I honestly can't believe how good this place is.  I have been a long-time fan of Carolina's so I feel bad for saying this, but Rito's beats it hands down.  I went for the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style (I meant to specify green sauce but I didn't so it came with red) and it was amazing.  I can't wait to try it again with the green sauce.  My friend ordered two shredded beef tacos...and wow.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Sure wish they would add no smoking signs in the seating/eating areas.  People lighting up detracts from the Rito's experience."}
{"text":"Food was salty. Lacked depth of flavor.  None of the Green chile or Pork stood out. Only tortilla and salt.  We had the green chili burro and red chili burro, both enchilada style.  There were hints of flavor past the salt, but not much.  My wife thought there was too much tortilla.  I slightly disagree,  I feel it helps the burro itself from getting to soggy, therefore I appreciate the amount of tortilla for texture.  We both agree not enough meat.  I think it's the novelty of the location that makes people like it more than they should. I too love the hole in the wall aspect of it.  Tucked in a side street, no sign.  Take out or eat outside.  I live a few blocks away,  I was really hoping I 'd love this place, but I don't see either of us craving it anytime soon, probably never."}
{"text":"I've been going in for at least 20 years and the food has always been great. The tacos are the best Phoenix has to offer."}
{"text":"BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER!!! There is a reason the line is out the door and people are willing to wait 10 to 15 minutes to get their order. It's authentic and made to order so if you're short on time call ahead to place your order but it's well worth the wait  Whether it's a burro or chimichanga, red or green, taco or enchilada, it's all amazing."}
{"text":"A bunch of us coworkers have been coming here for years. Rito's burro meat is definitely slow cooked with the sauce and so, so tender! My favorite is the Green Chili meat Burro, Green Enchillada style (ask for Green on Green). Taco's are incredible but no way way add that with the Green on Green without someone rolling you back to the car! I've been to Carolina's and it tastes good, but seems like their meat doesn't get the red or green put on until you order. This is a must try place, they now take plastic, outdoor picnic benches, but that hasn't kept us away for last 20 years!"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of my airbnb host, who claimed it was a secret neighborhood spot. From the outside, you can easily miss it, but it's well worth searching out. Extremely affordable food and drinks and, like many others have pointed out, the best green chile burro you'll ever have. Check it out!"}
{"text":"BEST Mexican food I have EVER eaten in my life. After traveling around the world trying Mexican foods of all different kinds, nothing can beat this for me. I was always go with a classic bean burrito but my dad always gets the red chile burrito. You can not go wrong with this menu!  Amazing! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is the best! They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky! they do have them call before you go! Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside. Take away only.They also have another location!!! Yea! In a strip mall on 51 ave & orangewood. They do serve \"tacos\" at this location!"}
{"text":"They only got a few things on the menu, all you need to order is a green chile burro enchilada style, nuf said..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little kid. I always get the Bean burrito enchilada style and every time it is perfection! It might not look like much from the outside but the food is great! Plan on waiting a little bit since its a real hot spot for everyone around lunch time."}
{"text":"First time here, had a rice & bean burrito, Mrs. Had a taco & tostada.  Both thought was very delicious. Reminded me of Mr. Gs/Chili Peppers down in Yuma. Outside seating only but is covered by umbrellas.  friendly staff. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp, you steered me wrong. A place shouldn't get extra stars because it is hard to find. This is just mediocre food in an odd location.   I had a shredded beef taco and a green burrito enchilada style. The taco was fine. Seemed fresh, but there was nothing great about it. The burrito easily had more cheese by weight than meat. The green sauce was better than ok, but not by much.  Now I have calorie regret and an unhappy stomach."}
{"text":"James V. Green chilli burrito one of the best I have ever had. I flip homes and was called to do one 5 homes down so one day I went ordered green chilli burrito and went back everyday until job was done and continue to go every chance I get."}
{"text":"My dad got me addicted to this place, over 25 years ago!  This is THE BEST Mexican food I've ever had.  I look forward to having my 'fix' whenever I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I took a few staycation days this week and made a list of things I never have time to do.  Getting food @ Rito's was on the list.  I've lived in Garfield for 2 years, but I work outside of the neighborhood from 9-5, so I'm never around during Rito's business hours (according to a sign inside, M-F, 9-4).  I rode my bike over on a fine, sunny Friday around 12:30.  I approached from the south, so I could see the patio seating.  If you approach from Roosevelt St., it's easy to miss this place!  There's no signage of any kind, but lots of people parking and waiting outside.  The atmosphere is absolute hole in the wall.  You order through a window with bars at the counter, which is a practical arrangement for the location.  Garfield is pretty chill these days, but that has not always been the case.  There are chairs along the wall for your waiting pleasure, but not nearly enough and they get snagged quickly.  There's a limited menu, but the day I visited, there were 4 specials written on a chalk board.  I am an enchilada girl, so I was pretty happy when I saw them on the specials board.  I know burritos are what Rito's is known for, but I figured I could come back any day and try a burrito.  I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas and a side of beans.  I waited about 15 minutes for my food.  I put it in my bike basket and pedaled home in anticipation of a great Mexican lunch.  The enchiladas were generous, but the sauce was not nearly as tasty as the sauce at Carolina's.  And the enchiladas were pretty greasy.  The beans were soupy and delicious.  I will not order the enchiladas again, but I will go back and give the burritos a try.  The sodas are in cans, so I passed on a beverage.  I'm glad I didn't wait until next week to make my Rito's excursion, because a sign inside announced that they'll be closed all week for \"spring break.\""}
{"text":"Best beans, green chili and tacos EVER! The enchilada style is never enough sauce for me so I pay the extra $1 for more sauce!"}
{"text":"I'm from El Paso, Tx & I know well done Mexican food. Rito's is the closest I've found to the real deal here in Phoenix & I've checked out over 25 places here in the sun valley!  Have the green chili burro served enchilada style."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food in Phoenix. The best green chile Burros and the best guacamole tacos ever!"}
{"text":"Best green chili burrito in AZ!  I always get the green chili mixed with beans inside a burrito.  Typically I take around 5 bites, and the burrito falls apart because all the goodness is spilling out.  I had the tacos once, and they were really good.  But it is the green chili I crave.  I took off a star because in the summer, it is way too hot to sit outside."}
{"text":"Over rated!! Traveled from the east valley and passed up a lot of places that have better food. Try Senior Taco at Power & McKellips for great burritos. Their chili verde is great"}
{"text":"This place confirms why \"hole in the wall\" places are the best places to get food. Its virtually impossible to find the place but once you smell the aroma of home-cooked Mexican food, you know that you're there. Usually there is a long line; however, their service is quick. With the combination of their swift service and decadently savory food, Rito's is a staple Mexican food stand that everyone has to visit when in Phoenix. I always have a green chilli burrito and haven't quite ventured out to other things on their menu, but I have never heard anything less than positive about what they have to offer."}
{"text":"I would give these ladies 10 stars if I could!  There is simply nothing better in life than a Rito's green burrito. I've been going there for 25+ years - consistently AWESOME!"}
{"text":"My first ritos enchiladas were served like slop. My order was taken quickly however I had to wait 45mins for my one enchilada, rice and beans. I was so bummed out after leaving!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to go 4-stars, I really did.  If there were half stars, this would be solid 3.5.    Every time my coworkers get Rito's takeout there's a buzz around the office, aroma of delicious chili and for the first time all day complete silence on the floor...but I'm not sure it lived up to the hype entirely.    My first piece of advice was delivered with a VERY serious face, \"It's in the ghetto. Do. Not. Stay. There. You MUST take it to go.\"   OK, people, 14th St. and Roosevelt is NOT the ghetto.  Maybe it's because I live downtown and the first time I lived alone I had to honk at the sleeping bum to roll out of my parking spot...but seriously, this place was clean enough and had a cute little \"patio\" with picnic tables filled with lunching professionals...which isn't always a good sign.     I ordered the green combo beef/bean enchilada style.  Why not go the gusto?  We waited less than 10 minutes and had piping hot food all the way back to the office.    The presentation was exactly what I expected; a full burrito slathered in melted cheese and swimming in red sauce.  The flavors were pretty good and the meat surprisingly tender.  The tortilla was soggy in the right spots and held up to all the sauce.    I have to admit I ate all of it but I may still be paying the price...trying to rally the 3pm lull is tough after a lunch like that and dinner is impossible.    It was good but I'm not sure it lives up to the hype or chant."}
{"text":"Long wait but totally worth it! I recommend calling ahead!! Best green chili burritos in the state! Guacamole tacos are better than you've ever expected."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite mexican joint to visit i need to start going here more often. The food is quality so good from the rice and bean burritos to the delicious tacos. There is usually a line but well worth the wait, never been disappointed or hungry after leaving Ritos. Love this place i would recommend it to everyone i know for sure."}
{"text":"Best place in town for burritos. We drive 45min just to get food. I will be a long term customer."}
{"text":"I have been an aficionado of Rito's for over a decade, and I can confidently say that it does not get any better, as far as authentic Mexican food goes.  I have never read the menu, but would venture to guess that everything is delicious.  I order exclusively red or green burritos, as well as the guacamole taco.  Each burrito is made to order, and features homemade green or red chili, an Arizona-Mexican food staple.  I would highly recommend asking for a red or green chili burrito, mixed with re-fried beans.  Having moved to Seattle relatively recently, I pray that one day, a Rito's magically appears; however, until then, I will continue to make my annual pilgrimage to the Mecca!"}
{"text":"Fantastic red chili burro enchilada style with rice and beans. New seats outside. I bring all my friends and they love it. No inside seating so mid summer is rough."}
{"text":"Simply, one of the best burritos ever. My personal favorite is the green chile with beef and beans, enchilada style. Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best red chili and beans in town. Believe me, I've tried at least a dozen different places. For that reason, they are very busy so be sure to pack some patience."}
{"text":"Burrito with green sauce.  Perfect all the way around.  I come here often and it's consistent.  Rito's is GOOD FOOD!"}
{"text":"The green chile burro is where it's at!! I am not a fan of green chile, but the meat is so tender and the flavor just works so nicely and it's not too sour or hot, it's perfect. It was a good sized burrito and then I also tried their beans a rice which are bomb. This place is a hidden gem, but don't miss it! The employees are awesome and can tell you all about the history of this family run business. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"Have you spent your days seeking the definition of perfection? Stop seeking and head over to Rito's and savor their state-of-the-art green chili burro. You'll experience eternal bliss and will realize that your search was indeed, well rewarded. I was there on 2/27/08 and noticed they've dropped tacos and tostadas from their offerings so if you're heart's set on those menu items, you might try another source.  I think they could get by with limiting the menu exclusively to their green chili burro and still have people standing in line at 10:30 on a Wednesday morning - like it was when I was there!"}
{"text":"Just touched down in Phoenix from NYC looking to satisfy my authentic Mexican food kick. Mission Accomplished.  I ordered the red chile burrito w/beans enchilada-style and it was everything I hoped for and more."}
{"text":"Rito's is as good as they say. One of my coworkers is moving in a month and we've pledged to go to Rito's at least once a week because she knows how much she'll miss it when it's gone.   Everyone loves their green chili burro but I just wanted to put a plug in for their tostadas; I always get a bean tostada and a guacamole tostada. So delicious and flavorful but you won't get that heavy, sleepy, mid-afternoon food coma that their burros tend to induce.  I echo all the negatives prior reviewers have mentioned: the staff is often rude, they only accept cash (seriously?), it's situated in a random not-so-nice neighborhood, and there's only crappy picnic table seating. But I still think the positives outweigh these significant gripes, I just recommend taking it to go and eating it back at the office! Mmm now I'm craving a guacamole tostada..."}
{"text":"Super tasty! I know good Mexican food and this one takes the money for authentic Mexican cuisine. My group tried the green chile burrito, bean burrito enchilada style, and guacamole tacos. Tasty and satisfying! The downside is they only have outside seating areas but that's when you can take your food to go and enjoy it elsewhere. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"There online ordering system is a joke. I had to wait 25 minutes after said order time literally an hour to get a simple burrito. Could have just went to Salsitas and been in and out in 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Rito's! U guys rock! U like Mexican food? Then this is the authentic place in Phoenix that you will come back to over and over again. Now if they just had a shaded seating area with misters it would be a 5 star rating in my book."}
{"text":"Green Chili Burrito Enchilada style.  They only make a few items, it's in da hood, and there is a line of people in suits out front every time I go.   Just one drawback, and it's no surprise, they take cash only.  That just sucks cuz sometimes I want to stop even when I don't have cash in my pocket.  Also, I think the hours are somewhat limited to just lunch.    Rito's is a WIN."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for quick Mexican take-out! Its a nice little hole-in-the-wall spot. I had a red chili beef and bean mix burrito enchilada style this time around. O-M-G it was AMAZINGGGGG! So full of flavor and very satisfying. I would definitely recommend this place as I myself frequent it at least once a month. Oh, and I tried the online ordering through yelp for this place and it was so easy to use! This place gets PACKED for lunch so it was such a relief to just walk-in, pick-up my order, and head back to the office. The process was so smooth I might just stick to it moving forward."}
{"text":"Yes, this mostly lived up to the hype. I must say that unlike many people in these reviews, I actually preferred the red over the green chile. I ordered one of each. Got the red enchilada style, the green au naturel.   If you're in central Phoenix and craving a burrito, this is the place to go. I can see how it would get really uncomfortable in the summertime, though; there's no indoor seating."}
{"text":"The bean and cheese chimichanga will destroy your universe and rebuild it as a place that is a stranger to suffering and pain, a beautiful world of rainbows and unicorns.  worth waiting in line."}
{"text":"My husband and I moved to the valley 3 months ago from San Diego. We have been on a mission to find good tacos to replace some of the best we've ever had in socal. Not only are these good.... but we both agree they are BETTER than san diego!!!! WE HAVE FOUND IT FINALLY!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I originally reviewed this place in Nov 2011.  Update:  This place still has the best mexican food in the valley. The red chile burro enchilada style is excellent and is highly recommended.  The menu is small but everyhting on it is great. The best of Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love this place cuz it's right next to my house and I've never heard of a green chili tostada before and I'm mexican so that's random. I always order the same thing w/rice cuz it's cheap, easy, reliable, and tasty.   bean tostada- big yummy tostada shell and the refined beans are not lardy or watery. thank u!  Green chili tostada- not super floury tasting or fatty meats. This is something you need to eat like quickly cuz it will get soggy!  side of rice-perfectly prepared and to be honest I think rice is so hard to make."}
{"text":"I love dives and Rito's nails it on all levels. The neighborhood is uber scary. There is a line out the door. The menu is limited to just a few classic items. Cash only. The food is high quality and comforting. Portions are generous. Lots of \"Best of Phoenix\" awards on the walls. You need a nap after you're done eating. Like I said... nailed it on all levels."}
{"text":"I have lived by this location for the past year and just recently tried it out for the first time. I have to say, I really liked it! The food was fresh and very affordable. Probably one of the better values I've come across in quite a while. My one word of advice is to make sure to give yourself time for getting your food. The place gets busy and can take a while to place your order and get your food."}
{"text":"Rito's has the BEST burritos in Phoenix (possibly in all of Arizona)! My mom went there when she was growing up and now the whole family goes. The burritos are cheap and huge. Prepare yourself because they are messy! There is no seating inside and no real parking. It's definitely a place where you should order ahead and pick up the food. There is always a line and they are only open on certain days/times. Do your research before going. It's also hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for. There is no sign and it looks like an old house. But with all that being said: I would still recommend it. I LOVE RITOS!"}
{"text":"you can quit searching for the best burritos and tacos in Phoenix!!!   they are right here at Rito's. they dont advertise, it's all word of mouth, it is th go-to place for Green and red chile!!!"}
{"text":"I drove up to this place and wasn't sure I was in the right spot but then I saw a little open sign and cars kept parking and going in so I followed.   I was tempted to get the green burrito enchilada style because everyone on here said to. And everyone before me in line was ordering it. But I had exploring to do so I figured if I got something crunchy I'd be able to pick it up and eat it in the car.   I got back to the car and opened my rice and bean chimichanga expecting it to be a regular sized fried burrito and omg it was huge! It was topped with sour cream and guacamole  so I thought I would just cut it all up and then eat it as I drove. I took one bite. Then another. Then another. And before I knew it it was gone. And I hadn't even left the parking lot.   I feel ashamed. My only complaint is that this place is not in Sacramento.  Edit: I went back yesterday with the mom and we got a green chili burrito enchilada style. Couldn't resist. This time we ate outside. And it was yummy"}
{"text":"OMG these burritos are amazing. We were just about to return our rental car at the Phoenix Airport  and I was trying to find a place nearby to stop for food before hitting the airport. Thank you Yelpers for recommending such a great place!! I ordered the Red Chili Burrito with the tortilla warmed on the grill giving it a great texture with a red chili sauce with carne on the inside. This did not disappoint and I might return back to the Phoenix Airport just to go get another burrito. Remember this is a cash only place!"}
{"text":"Not a huge selection on the menu, but delicious nonetheless.  The place is only open for lunch, with its only seating outdoors.  We visited on a beautiful January day and the place was packed.  Didn't have to wait long for our food, which is always good.    This restaurant is in the middle of a residential neighborhood with zero signage outside.  We heard about it from a friend that had been before, otherwise we never would've seen it.  It's not a place you just drive by and want to try.  I had a bean tostada which was delicious.  The beans were so creamy - I just wish I would've had two.  They also sell canned soda, which for some reason, I love!  Cash only"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've ever had! The authentic tacos and enchilada style burros are awesome. It gets busy at lunch time and the seating is outside."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. com I love it we at least try to go there once a week for there taco they are so yummy and made with love. Today I tried a tosada in was great and all my food was hot and well prepared. I will say if you do not call ahead of time or make an online order there is a little wait because they make everything fresh, but threw all that it is still worth the wait. I am loyal customer"}
{"text":"I am a harsh critic when it comes to Mexican Food.  My good buddy Paul talked me into coming to this place.  When I asked him what to expect, he was correct in saying: \"Don't worry dude, just get the green on green with a taco on the side and watch the hood life unfold.\"  He was CORRECT!  This place is in the hood and they open at 10:30am for lunch.  The lines get long at about 11am.  They have a video game from the 80s while you wait. They serve drinks in THE CAN so I would suggest getting a 32oz thirstbuster beforehand.  If you go in the summer, you will be HOT in the summer heat as the only place to sit are at the picnic tables located OUTSIDE of course.  If you try to alter your order, you will be SCOWLED AT by the cashier.  However, if you treat her with respect, she will say something in spanish to the old heavy hispanic lady in the kitchen who stirs the chili and the fat lady will either NOD or shake her head.  All in all - a great place to eat!!"}
{"text":"My mouth is salivating just from writing this review. I recently moved out of state and out of everything, friends included, Rito's Burritos are what I miss most. Juicy burritos full of flavor and filling as well... which means a lot to me because I eat like a man.  ...Although the staff all look/act like they're employed against their will... that's the only bad thing I can say about this place. Delicioso!"}
{"text":"If you people don't like Rito's shut the hell up this is my favorite place to get a burrito, you can't ever go wrong with the green chili burrito it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas = AMAZING. Red  Burro = AMAZING. Cannot speak any more highly of this place. It is a little hole in the wall. Or maybe I should say a house converted into a to-go counter. But that is just the appeal of this place. You get some down home cooked mexican food. This place comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best out there. I used to go all the time when I worked downtown. Now I drive half an hour just for a fix. My go to is a bean burro enchilada style with green sauce. Best EVER! The green sauce is so yummy. I'm craving some right now.   Note: They're closed for the week, reopening August 7."}
{"text":"Red Chile Burro, Enchilada Style.  DONE AND DONE!  Show up on Saturday or Tuesday and you MIGHT be blessed with tacos made by Nana. I've been coming here for 5 years (which makes me a newbie) and while at first I thought the burros were a bit off in the red chile/tortilla ratio, you won't forget the flavor of the red chile. One morning, you'll wake up after a night of too much fun and CRAVE Rito's.  Family owned and operated this little gem is worth the weight (and wait) in gold. Just don't forget...cash only!"}
{"text":"I was abducted on a hungover Saturday morning and takin this this place. At first I was a little nervous, it's in the hood, no sign saying this is even a business, bars on the ordering windows. But hot damn, this food was good. A must for a hungover, gut soaking meal.  I'll definitely be returning....just maybe with my gun next time. Haha jk"}
{"text":"Rito's gots the Best Burritos, hands down!!   I ordered the green on green burrito. It was soooo gooood!!! I feel like a stuffed burrito now. But these burritos are as good as they look, and the taste is like your over at Nana's house for some homemade real Mexican food!! This will be the spot I run to when I'm feeling a saucy, cheesy, flavorful burrito.   The only thing I gotta say is, since the only spot to sit was outside on their patio with no shade, we kept dodging the neighborhood bee who kept stopping by at our table since we had open can sodas. Maybe next time we'll be smart like the other table sitting next to us and bring our own sodas, lids and all."}
{"text":"This is Phoenix's best Green Burrito. It's just the BEST. Iv come here since I was a kid and one thing I know (and something you will also learn if your new) the line is almost always out that slamming door"}
{"text":"Best green chili burrito in the world. I had mine enchilada style. So good. Their green chili just stands out from anyone else's."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Mexican food! Order online to avoid the lines!!"}
{"text":"A place so famous they don't even need a sign and supposedly voted as best burritos. First I asked them what they were known for and the lady told me their burritos because their beans were amazing. So I thought I was getting a burrito with beans and rice. What beans? No rice, no beans, it was literally just 4 chunks of meat and runny sauce, I had to get a spoon to eat it. I paid $5 for some sauce and 4 chunks of meat and a flour tortilla. I didn't even want meat, I wanted beans. I tried to go inside to talk to them about it but there was a line out the door. What a rip off. The place is obviously making a killing and yet they have no sign outside, no menus with descriptions, extremely limited menu, no a/c, limited drinks (they didn't have all the drinks because they were waiting for a shipment.) What a disaster. Someone is raking in huge profits and obviously mismanaging this place. But go ahead and call them \"authentic\" no thanks, there are better places."}
{"text":"Rito's easily has the best red chile and beans in the world, maybe even universe- now that Pluto is not a planet.   Don't be scared by the wussies that say the area is scary- I guess when you live in Sun City- the big city can be scary. On any given day the place will be packed with city workers, CPAs, medical staff from Good Sam, teachers and the occasional sketchy dude.   This family owned spot puts out amazingly good food. The menu is limited-but it's all about quality not quantity. I do not feel that the food is overpriced at all. You are buying fresh made food with soul-if you want heartless crap hit Taco Hell on McDowell.   If you live a charmed life and they're selling tacos when you are there- for the love of heysoos- buy three. The guacamole tacos are amazing. If they were to become illegal- I would rob old people so I could support my habit.  If only they would step up their game and offer fountain drinks- that would be great. Cans of soda do not help during hot summer months."}
{"text":"No signage at all. A bit pricey, CASH only! Limited hours, horrible parking, no indoor seating and competition for shaded seating on the half-dozen picnic tables of the back patio in this residential neighborhood. Expect the line to be out the door and you are probably going to have to wait a minute to get your lunch; because this is the best damn hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint in the valley. If you have a tourist and want to really give them the Barrio Burrito experience, this is it. Everything is well worn-in and the look of things might scare off the meek gringo. But it is exceptionally clean and the staff are friendly. The Chimichanga shouldn't be eaten any further than 20' from the front door, if you don't have time to eat it there: take another look at your life's priorities or order something else. I've had the amazing Red Chili Beef almost every visit, but last time had the Rice & Bean Chimi which may be a new veg fav. The beef tacos are those amazingly greazy corn shells that may or may not be totally deep-fried, order extra hot sauce and don't ask silly questions. Rice & refried beans are just as they should be and even make a tostada delicious! They sell bags of fresh tortilla & chips, but I've never seen nachos on the menu. Everything they do have on the menu though is best-in-class, assuming you like this class. If it's the middle of the week like between 11 - 4, I've got a $20 bill and a hankering for Mexican Al Fresco - Rito's. Who's down?"}
{"text":"If you can put aside their absolutely absurd hours, I recommend you have this place especially if you're a fan of the enchilada style burrito! Their green chili burrito enchilada style with rice and beans on the side changed the standard for me. You will love this place and you will be back. Just try to schedule some time to come when they are open."}
{"text":"This place is a house across the street from an elementary school.  You will wait 10-15 minutes in line just to order, then another 10-15 minutes just to get your food.  There is no where to sit but outside (so summers get the food to go).   Also this place is the dive of all dives when it comes to Mexican food.  All that said, i dream about their food and curse them for not being open on the weekends!    The green chile anything is good, I get just a bean and rice burrito and then add green enchilada sauce.   I would drink that green sauce by the buckets if i could. I even asked if i could order just the sauce for to-go and they told me no.  BOO!  Bottom line if you are adventurous and like mexican food this is your place.  One more tidbit I am pretty sure the green sauce is not vegetarian, but that has not stopped my veggie friend from still eating eating it.  She just picks out any chicken in the sauce she sees! ha ha  That is how much she likes it!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated! Converted from a house! Hole in the wall joint! Call in your order or suffer the consequences!!! This place is thee best for Beans!!! The kind that make you lick the plate!!! I once heard someone complain \"if this place was a bar you'd never get drunk\" to which I replied \"if this place was a bar, one drink is all you'd need!\" Simply amazing food! Do it! Or else!"}
{"text":"This would def be five star if they more efficient process and tables inside. It's freakin hot out and I don't like eating in my car"}
{"text":"Every time I am in town I have to have a green chile burrito and Rito's is the only place to get it. I drive from Utah to PHX only for this. It is the best of the best. Debating moving to Phoenix solely for Rito's burritos. I'm not kidding."}
{"text":"Love it! No one, not one person in town beats their green chile. The beans are delicious.  Must try!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Per most the recommendations I read here on Yelp I had the Green Chile Enchilada Style.  The burrito was large and a bit spicy, very good.  I can't recommend it enough.  There were a few minor negatives.  Service is a bit slow, no fountain soda and menu options are limited to burritos, chimis and a couple of tostadas, but as long as you know this going in you will be very happy.  Bottom line = Great food at reasonable prices.    They were also serving Tacos when I was there 8/3/09.  I've noticed some reviews say they stopped serving them, but they must on occasion.  They are not back on the menu, but they had a cardboard sign at the counter stating that they were for sale that day. Lastly, it has been stated in other reviews, but in case you missted it Rito's is Cash Only."}
{"text":"A friend told me about Rito's, referring to it as reminiscent of Seinfeld's \"The Soup Nazi\" place.  Okay, so there is no surly Eastern European dude barking at you, but it does have the whole waiting in a long line, preparing a head of time what you'll order, and leaving with a delicious meal feeling.    Yes, this place is busy. Depending on when you go, there may be a line outside the building, and a tedious wait.  But all of that is in comparison to the heartbreaking, taste-bud savoring meal you will have.  I've had their infamous green chile burro and their just as famous (I think everything on the menu is famously good) bean burro.  And, of course, both have been enchilada style.  I can't even imagine not having their complexly flavored sauce smothered all over my burros. My next menu try?  Well, they aren't even on the menu, but their tacos.  I guess you just have to ask for them, and if they made them that day, you can claim it to be your lucky day.   The portions are huge and the prices are small.  A great business model, in my opinion!  And, I'm sure one of the many reasons why people keep coming back to Rito's. I know I will be!"}
{"text":"look for the chicken tacos!!! If they are out--the burros enchilada style are the best in town--been going there for years and never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"The food from this place is just fantastic.  I should preface this by saying that I have never been to the restaurant itself, and have just been the happy recipient of takeout.  Some of my fellow coworkers made it fairly clear that unless you're Mexican, you shouldn't be showing your face here, so they'd go pick up food for everyone and bring it back.  Just very simple and delicious Mexican food, great stuff."}
{"text":"Great food, well worth the chance to try. We visited back in 2014 and forgot to post a review. I look forward to visiting again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Pretty much take a guess and pray they are open.. Tried several different weekends and they were on siesta.  Worth the wait! The drive! Whatever sacrifice you need to make, do it.  To give you an idea of how much my honey and I love this place... I am 6 months prego with our first child, you would think he has pictures of me on his phone. Kid you not it is a picture of his burrito at Ritos!"}
{"text":"Can you say burrito? Can you say waiting in line to taste the green chili yumminess is TOTALLY worth it? YES!! It's a hole in the wall in the middle of a neighborhood, but don't let the appearance distract you from the finished product! It's fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Rito's... Hands down some of the tastiest mexican in town. If you like chain mexican, or have and nervousness about going to the \"hood\". then take your weak taste buds and your timid self elsewhere.  If you do venture to Rito's you'll find amazing green chili burros and fantastic tacos awaiting you. It doesn't matter how often I go, It always seems like I forget how great this stuff is.  Maybe it is chock full o' lard, maybe it has ground up unicorns or fairy dust, but whatever it is. It's magically delicious...."}
{"text":"Amazing. Best Mexican food I've ever had. Green Chile Burro with beans is to die for. Most people recommend it enchilada style, but that's not for me. On yelp it says they are open Saturday's, but I went 08/01/15 and they were not."}
{"text":"They now accepting credit cards . Don't go close to their closing . They were extremely busy. Try mixing the green burro with beans for those who do not like it that spicy.  They have the best refried beans . Also try their tacos"}
{"text":"This restaurant  has great food , always very consistent, I love their  green chili but it tend to be a li5 runny. I prefer to let it sit for a day. Their beans are great very tasty not sure that I want to know what is in it . They also have a great taco. Lines are extre6 long you need to call in your orders"}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight, this is New Mexican style food. And its delicious. Watch out for the lunch crowd, as the line builds out the door by 12pm. As everyone else seems to agree, go with the chili (either red or green) burro, enchilada style. The best thing about it is the New Mexican style sauce.  If you're looking for authentic Mexican, there's better."}
{"text":"If you are looking for fancy folks lounging around fancy furniture eating tiny overpriced meals... this IS NOT the place for you! Rito's only offers one thing... the best traditional, home-style Mexican food the Valley has to offer. Simple, tasty and made with pride and care. It is pretty much a take out place although they do have a small amount of patio furniture outside for when the weather is nice.   Anyone who knows will tell you that Rito's has had the BEST green chili burros you may rver find although everything they make is above average. The prices are all very reasonable as well. I can feed my family of 4 for only $20.00!  So if you are in the valley of the sun and aren't an ambiance snob... give Rito's a try. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"This place is the best. Ive been eating here since I was 5 years old off and on. Every time I visit i enjoy my food just a little bit more than the time before. A sure thing is always the Green chili burrito.  This is one of the Great Mexican food places in Phoenix. If you haven't tried it you are missing out."}
{"text":"This is definitely your hole in the wall, but definitely delicious hidden gem. Ritos has been around for years. My parents came here when they were in there teens. The smells alone of this place will have your mouth watering the minute you walk in the house on the corner looking building. The menu is posted to your immediate left. They now have a daily offering of tacos and enchiladas included with there infamous burritos enchilada style. There beans and rice are a must with any food option you decide on. I usually opt for the green chili burrito enchilada style with a side of rice and beans. Only complaint I'd have to say is there prices are a bit steep. Be prepared to spend a minimum of $10 depending on what you order. Furthermore, definitely a hidden treasure in the Garfield district."}
{"text":"I'm full blown Mexican from the state of durango in a ranch with maybe a population of 100, where what you ate that day you killed that day...basically real organic,fresh made from scratch Mexican food I know the real deal...growing up in El Paso tx I ate a lot of authentic Tex mex food, since moving here it's what I miss the most THE FOOD! Nothing but trash filibertos and chain Mexican restaurants here until I found this place...Ritos is the real deal made from scratch rich delicious Mexican food! Trust me you won't be disappointed, also avoid lunch time it gets super busy! Up to 40min wait for food around that time ...enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix.  Affordable, fast, and delicious! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 tostadas with absolutely no lettuce or tomatoes. Unfortunately this is not what I received. Very disappointing I was not able to enjoy my meal. I will give my business to Carolina's instead. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"Taste is still perfection, but they have definitely gotten smaller in size over the last several months. I drive down from Flagstaff for these delicious morsels, but this makes me question my sanity. Why o why?!"}
{"text":"Best bean burro! I recommend enchilada style. My family had been coming here for at least 20 years, and besides when \"grandma\" stopped making the tacos it has always been top notch."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was a kid!! Best tacos I've found... green chile is sooooo good."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in South Phoenix in 1952 on Mexican Food. I discovered Rosemary's Green Burrito's while going threw Real Estate School in 1989 and they are  BY FAR THE VERY BEST BEST I have ever tasted and I have eaten Mexican Food in EVERY Western State including TX. 3-5 day's a week. I HAD to move in 2010 to Seattle WA. I lay in bed at night a daydream about eating one of Rito's Green Burrito's.  PLEASE WOULD SOMEONE BE SO KIND AND SHIP ME A DOZEN? I will be forever GRATEFUL.  sandra@sandracrosby.com   SUBJECT = RITO'S IN PHX."}
{"text":"I've been here sooo many times, but I always forget to write a review because I'm so focused on rushing back to work and chowing down on their green chile burrito, enchilada style. This is what I order EVERY time I'm here. This thing is MASSIVE!!!! It's not that spicy, but it certainly has a little kick to it. It is absolutely delicious and I hate that I love this place so much.  Rito's is a local, family owned joint. This place gets crowded during lunch hour and there's very, very limited waiting room inside as well as very limited parking. There's a small private lot as well as street parking. There are a few shaded eating tables outside for those who enjoy burning in the lovely Arizona heat, but there are zero tables to eat indoors.  If you usually take your lunch at noon, I recommend calling in your order in advance or placing it online!   I'm gonna miss Rito's!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Wish they had indoor seating though. The rice is sensational. I also like the tostadas and green chili burritos."}
{"text":"Pretty impressed.  Great value for the price you pay.  Not everything I had was a home run, but a truly legit Mexican take out spot.  I had recently seen the Check Please AZ segment and read the Yelp reviews about this place.  I live downtown but up until now I didn't even know this place existed.  So I decided to stop by at opening on Saturday morning.  The location is exactly what I expected.  A divvy hole in the wall in the middle of residential street in the Garfield District.  The only parking is in the street and the building isn't labeled so be sure to know the address of this place in advance.  I had heard this place was typically busy at lunch during the work week but expected to get in and out pretty fast on a Saturday.  Uh, no.  The line was 12 deep when I arrived which was just 5 minutes after 10am.  The crowd in line was super diverse (white, black, hispanic, and even asian folks) so clearly word has gotten out about this place.  I believe you can call in your order if you wanna run by and pick it up rather than wait in line like I did.  So after about 10 minutes in line, I got to put in my order.  The dish that seemingly everyone talks about as Rito's 101 is the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style with Red or Green Sauce (I went with Red).  A family friend raved about their refried beans so I got some of those in the bowl as well.  Total price was $10 (FYI, they take credit and debit cards now so its no longer cash only).  Took about 20 minutes to get my food.  It's strictly a takeout place, but they do have a tiny amount of seating outside the building.  Being that it was a warm summer day when I went, I decided to just make the 5 minute drive home to eat.  Alright to the food.  Portions are huge.  Burrito comes in a huge bowl and was oozing red sauce with beans on the side (see my photo).  Smelled divine.  I've had a lot of burritos in my time, but this is up there with some of the best I've had.  Great chunks of meat mixed in with Hatch green chiles.  The red sauce and cheese complimented the tortilla very well and the sauce wasn't as watery as I had feared.  Great burrito all around.  The beans on the other hand were a disappointment.  Maybe its just me, but I prefer my refried beans to have a little more chunkiness to them.  Rito's beans are almost more of a puree.  The taste is fine, I just prefer to taste like I'm biting into actual chunks of beans.  All in all, I was impressed at the size and quality of the food I got for the money.  As busy as it was today, I can't even imagine how busy it gets during the work week.  Next time I come here I'll try to call ahead and maybe give the chimichangas a whirl.  Would certainly recommend this spot if you're in the neighborhood.  And if you're still hungry after eating one of their burritos, its your fault."}
{"text":"Well, it's been over a year since last time I ate here. Rito's isn't exactly close to work, but I decided to have the same thing. Green burro, enchilada style and it was just as good as I remembered it to be. This sauce has to be made from scratch, it taste like the home made sauce that mom would use when making the Christmas tamales. Wow! pure heaven."}
{"text":"This place was delicious...I got a green chili burrito enchilada style with rice and beans...The chili was homemade and not from a can...One of the BEST burrito's I have had in a very long time...Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has central phoenix written all over it. I've ate her a few times and both times it has been delicious. It's just one of those places where you can just feel the \"Phoenician\" in. Personally, I love the tacos, but they only serve them on a few days. The green burritos enchilada style are also a favorite. The venue is cute and comfy, very minimal. It's also pretty hood, but unless you're from Ohio or something, it's not too sketchy. There are bright painted picnic tables outdoors. The crowd is diverse, from office workers, familys, youngsters ect. Everyone is there to just grab some yummy food and eat. I like the fact that it's in a neighborhood, it's a nice feel. It's very busy during lunch hours, so any time after 1:30 is perfect to drop by and grab a bite. :)"}
{"text":"Heaven in the 'Hood!  October 15th, 2010 - The last time I had the pleasure of stuffing my face with a green chili burrito from this little restaurant-equivalency of an orgasm. The following day I was off to California, where I would live, away from home for the first time in my entire life. 700+ miles away from my friends, FINE! Hundreds of miles away from my Mom and Dad, NO PROBLEM! Light years away from my little brother and my only niece, COOL! But no Rito's Green Chili burrito within 715 miles, HELL NO! This is where I draw the line. I am currently constructing a full-proof plan to move my little family and I from San Jose, back to Phoenix! Because this is bullshit!"}
{"text":"Great Spot for some traditional homemade food. I would say it is more tex-mex than Sonoran style, but it is good! My only suggestion, get there early, as the line starts to stack up at lunch time."}
{"text":"It's a little hard to believe that this unmarked house across the street from a school is actually a restaurant, but once you get beyond the security barred door you find yourself in a dimly lit, non-temperature controlled waiting room.  It must be good though because I've never seen this room empty.  People come and go the whole time you're waiting for your food.  They stand behind the security bar and you exchange payment/receipts through the space underneath.  Then you wait and get your food under the grate next to the \"order here\" window.  Why all the security?  I'm hoping never to really find out..  The food!  Although it's a bit nickel-and-dimey, ultimately it's decently priced.  It seems like they typed up a nicer looking menu recently too that helps immensely (before all I had was a picture of the lego board they had up).  Anyway, the food is pretty legit authentic Mexican dripping with verde sauce and covered with cheese.  If you're looking for Mexi-comfort, look no further!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service (25 minutes to get 3 basic tacos) and tacos are average at best.  My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.  Reminds me of a traditional western jailhouse except someone is actually taking food orders."}
{"text":"This is a no-brainer. Go. It has weird hours. Go. The menu is complicated. Go. Good Tex-Mex and Northern Mexican. I was born here and have spent a lot of time in Mexico. I don't mess around with OK Mexican places.  No frills. No convenience. No BS. Great food."}
{"text":"I grew up in this neighborhood n eating at Rito's , it's classic Mexican food made by mom and grandma and Tia like ladies! I highly recommend the Red burrito enchilada style !"}
{"text":"I love this place, there's only a few options but you can get him a few different ways and no matter what you get it tastes fantastic there's a small sit-down area outside and no bathrooms so make sure you use it before you come. Anytime I find myself even remotely close to Ritos I make the detour to come over here and get some food."}
{"text":"There's a place in Yuma, AZ called Chili Pepper which has some of the best Mexican fast food I've ever eaten. Once I moved to Phoenix, there has been a great citywide search by a group of us Yumans to find someone here that reminds us of Chili Pepper's marquee entree: The Bean, Rice & Cheese Burrito (not tm). Carolina's came close. Juan's fell decidedly short. A few other run down shacks that we've tried have always been inconsistant or disappointing...  One slow mid-morning at work we were trying to figure out a good fast place to get takeout and bring back to the office. Someone mentioned Ritos. Someone mentioned that they have the best bean and cheese burrito. My ears perked up. Upon arriving I noticed that they actually have a bean, rice and cheese burrito on the menu, something that most places have never heard of.  The burrito itself was HUGE. The salsa can be purchased in a large enough container that the whole burrito can be dipped in (don't laugh, this is an important aspect) and provides enough flavor and kick to compliment the beany goodness inside. After going there 3 times in one week, I am ready to declare this place even BETTER than my once perfect Chili Pepper."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try since I read a couple reviews and honestly I don't know if I went to the same place. I tried a green chile burrito and my boyfriend had the red and honestly couldn't even eat half. Not sure what the rave was about but we werent impressed. There are definitely other places near by that are better than this."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE the red chile burrito...sometimes I get it with cheese, sometimes plain...It's always amazing.  The beans are also AMAZING...Tacos AMAZING!!! Hot sauce AMAZING!!!  I only wish they were open 24-hours a day!  I've seen other reviewers complain about the neighborhood...I don't think it's as bad as all that.  Besides, all of the cops and first responders eat at Rito's, too!  Don't be afraid to go there and even eat your food outside at one of the picnic tables.  You'll be just fine...until they call your number when your food is ready...then you will be in heaven!   Gotta go get me some!"}
{"text":"I heard about this little gem when I overheard some people raving about it at the top of camelback mountain. I try to treat myself after my hikes, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm so glad I did! It's a hole in the wall(those are always the best!). It's crowded  with people waiting for their order. It's not a typical sit down place. You order at the window, pay, and move to the side with everyone else and wait for your food. It's a bit of a wait, but wow, you won't be sorry for the wait. I got the green chile burrito, enchilada style. Now, I can't tell you what makes it so good, it just is. It's messy and absolutely delicious! They have several tables outside(no inside seating), but most people get it to go. Do yourself a favor and give it a try."}
{"text":"Four words make me salivate:  Rito's.  Green.  Chili.  Burro.  I am actually salivating as I write this on a full stomach.  It's damn the diet kind of food because this is one of life's great pleasures.  The most important thing about Rito's green chili burro is avoiding a blowout.  A blowout is defined as recklessly biting into the burro and putting too much pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.  This creates a hole in the tortilla and the stew drips all over you.  Not only do you lose out on the greatness of the broth, but you have a mess on your hands.  Avoid a blowout at all costs.  The best method I have found is to massage the burro from the bottom up so as to get some of the liquid to the top of the tortilla.  Then when you start taking your first few bites, suck in when you bite.  This ensures you get plenty of liquid with each bite and you sufficiently reduce the pressure on the bottom of the tortilla.  If the unfortunate occurs and you do experience a blowout, the best course of action is to remember the three second rule and quickly lick up all the broth on your hands, fingers, and table.  Sometimes it happens to the best of us so don't be too hard on yourself."}
{"text":"I found Rito's by looking at their 4 1/2 star Yelp review.  I have to be honest, I didn't read the reviews; I just saw the overwhelming praise via the star rating and went just on that recommendation alone.  I am a HUGE fan of burritos - mostly from restaurants where I am the only non-hispanic in the place.  I have found a few places that never disappoint, but I am always in search of the Holy Grail of burritos, which I will probably spend the rest of my life gorging myself in vain - never satisfied that I have discovered the perfect burrito, like a confident New World explorer in search of the fountain of the youth - convinced that it is just around the river bend.  Anyhow, to the food......  My preference is carne asada burritos, which they do not carry.  No problem ---  I tried one of the beef green chili burritos.  Employees were super nice, price was reasonable, restaurant was clean, and  wait time was reasonable.  I figured out quickly that there was no interior seating, which was not an issue as I was focused on one thing - finding the best burrito I have ever tried.  It was not the best burrito I have ever had, and it was not the worst burrito by far.  I don't really consider it a burrito per se.  It was more like a light beef stew served in a folded tortilla - extremely watery, like soup.  Even as soup, it would have been a little bland.  To its credit, the beef was extremely tender.  Unfortunately, there wasn't much flavor there.  I took one bite into the end of the burrito, and based on the pressure caused by the watery contents, the entire bottom of the burrito ripped open and most the contents fell out.  I blame this not on my jaws of steel, but on the watery consistency of the filling and mostly on the relatively low quality tortilla.  Did that keep me from eating the whole thing and using the cap of my small salsa container as a spoon?  You already know that answer to that question.....  Then, I began to think that maybe their best meal isn't the burrito, but their good reviews are based on the variety of other options.  I didn't go back and read the reviews, so maybe that's the case.  Would I order another burrito from here?  No.  Would I order another item that might be more to my liking and, more importantly, explain why they got such great Yelp reviews?  Probably not.  Why?  I have about a thousand more burritos to try in my never-ending quest to discover the perfect burrito.  And when I do, I probably won't let anybody know so I can have all of them to myself."}
{"text":"Absolute go to for Mexican food. Beans are like my Nana's. I recommend you try everything on the menu but if it's your first time I suggest the green chile burrito! They have an app I highly recommend that too. With all good things there's a wait...be ready and enjoy the deliciousness"}
{"text":"Come on people... I don't even live in Phoenix and I know about Rito's.   I grew up eating Mexican food (my dad is Mexican) and this is real Mexican food, no doubt about it. Rito's has been in the same location on 14th street for a long long time... I think around 30 years. There isn't a sign outside...you just have to know it's there.  Just look for the people walking out with smiles on their faces and to go containers in their hands.  When I was there for lunch it was filled with city workers, parents with young kids, and retiree's who live in the neighborhood.  Rito's is family owned, and honestly, I think grandma does the cooking. Also, it's cash only.   You pretty much have to know what you want when you get to the order window because the place is packed and they don't have time to answer your questions about what's in this and what's in that.   After asking the other patrons in line what's the best,  they pretty much all said the same thing...Green Chili Burro...I think it was less than five bucks. I also ordered the beans and rice. My husband ordered the same thing. There was so much food that we could have easily shared one with all the extras...I guess we figured since it was so cheap it's be small...no way...HUMONGOUS!    We took it to go and ate it in the car...cheese, beans and rice were flying every where, the windows were steamed up...the car was rockin' cause we were soooo happy...I'm sure passers by thought something kinky was goin' on inside our car. Nope...just chowin' down on some damn good Mexican food.   I hope I haven't given it away and blown the secret of Rito's by Yelping it...I love the fact that there isn't a sign, you have to know about it to know that it is even exists and it's a locals only kinda place.  The prices are right, the food rocks and it's family owned...what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Best refried beans! Love there crispy shell beef tacos! This small hole in the wall gets very busy and very crowded but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My husband heard about Rito's through a news report and we decided to check it out for lunch earlier this week.  You certainly need to know about this place because it doesn't have much drive by appeal.   Make sure to get here early as a line forms throughout lunch for this tasty food.   Friendly staff, plenty of outdoor space to enjoy your lunch and even with you dog and the food was great.  We enjoyed the beef and cheese enchiladas with rice and beans...simple, but so tasty!"}
{"text":"I could drink the hot sauce it's so so good. The guacamole tacos are the bomb and the red Chile is great too. They usually take forever, so I'm only giving 4 stars."}
{"text":"The burro with green sauce and rice & beans is amazing.  Ive been coming here for the last 10 years+"}
{"text":"So I go Ritos Mexican Restaurant on 14th st Roosevelt almost every other day. Yes there food is that good. Well that's all about to change! About 3 months ago I ordered a bean and cheese burrito as I'm pouring the beans into my plate I grab some w my spoon and as I do so I see a nice big black hair so I call ritos speak to john he apologizes and offeres me a free meal next time so I let it go and went back about 4 days later (trying to decide if I wanted to go back) but I did this time I order a bean burrito enchilada style w red sauce I open it up cut it open and there goes a sticker from the freezer w the date that the food expires inside my burrito!!!! So I call John apologizes again says the same thing well I said okay I'll just take a break from there (lasted about a week) and there I am again back at ritos been going for about 2 weeks every other day now from the last incident and it's going good... till today!!! May 23, 2018 around 1:30pm I order the same bean burrito enchilada style park in their parking lot and as I go in for a cut a looonnnng big hair is being pulled by the knife coming from inside the beans/burrito!!!! At this point I'm furious and I'm disgusted that this hair incident has happened twice and 3 times them messing up inside my food!!! So I go back inside show the manager and a worker (some girl in green shirt taking orders) my burrito show him the hair and he pulls it out w the knife and says oh yeah it's inside there. I'm so sorry we lent roll our workers before they cook and they all wear hair nets... hair nets? With half their hair sticking out of the nets and some don't even have them on! He goes on to say how he wishes it didn't happen to me and he will return my money. I'm so disgusted and mad I grabbed my money and said I'll never be back here again! PLEASE BEWARE OF RITOS ON 14th st and ROOSEVELT BEANS! Obviously this isn't the first time this has happened and I'm sure there much more hair in that food of theirs!!!! Ritos definitely lost a loyal customer for good!!! 3 strikes your out!!!"}
{"text":"The best red chili burritos in Phoenix. I definitely recommend this place to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"WOW this hidden spot is incredible!! This is a MUST visit in Phoenix. The Green Chile enchilada was out of this world good! I want another one right now! This is truly hole in the wall eats at its finest. My top 3 places to eat at in Arizona. Rito's keeps it simple and short with their menu. I'm coming back next time to try the red sauce!"}
{"text":"The green chili is a must and the guacamole tostada is a favorite.  I've been eating at this place for 30 years and am so glad they continue to have the same quality food they have always had.  This is my FAVORITE hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Rito's Mexican food is as good as it gets. Literally \"hole in the wall\" kind of place. Everything made is fresh and made to order. The bean burrito enchilada style is what I always get and it's awesome. When they have tacos, those too are really good, some of the best I've had. This is a go to place if you're in the area and just want a quick lunch. Great people and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Their food is so good they need metal bars to protect it. Seriously the order and pick up windows are behind bars, but it may be due to the neighborhood.  This is a place the Yelp is good for. There is no way you will find this driving by as its off the main road and has no sign on the outside. The only indication was the line of people going out the door.    Seating is limited to some dilapidated picnic tables on the adjacent patio.   The menu board is quite simple only listing burritos and chimi changas and tostadas, apparently there are some off menu options that are not posted.  I ordered the a bean chimi changa, It was a bean burrito deep fried and then dolloped with guacamole and sour cream there was cheese sprinkled on top of this. It was served on a small bed of shredded lettuce in a white container.  The Beans are flavorful and runny like a bean dip, the fried tortilla was great a it should be, the guacamole was a neon green fake variety and the sour cream was cold and firm .   There were down sides, the price was a bit steep considering the location, potion size and lack of seating. They ration the hot sauce and charge $.15 for a thimble or $.50 for a small cup.  Drink are cans of soda only. And the line was long and poorly structured. this is why it only gets 3 stars, the food is good but the drawbacks hurt it.   Also Note CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Best green and red chili in town. Wonderful tortillas and fun place to go when the weather is not blazing hot. Have only patio seating. Did I mention the beans also the best  in town. Only open for lunch."}
{"text":"I got some tacos at a taco stand in Rocky Point once that were the best tacos I've ever had.....until now!  I got two Beef and Guacamole tacos. Unfortunately they were gone before I could snap a pic of them to go with my review.   They must handmade their tortillas because the shell on these things are phenomenal. Light and crisp, excellent flavor. Totally worth the price and the wait."}
{"text":"This a neighborhood carry out place that has a fairly limited menu but some really fine food. I had the green chili burrito, enchilada style, and it was spicy and delicious with lots of beef."}
{"text":"Since I moved to San Francisco, I have sometimes contemplated going to Phoenix, buying as many Rito's burritos as I could afford, and bringing them back to my freezer for emergencies.  I LOVE this place.  This is real Mexican food.  They serve salad with the Mexican food here in the bay.  If this place opened up on Geary in SF, there would be lines around the block!  Have a Red Chili and bean burrito enchilada style with a taco.  You will come back."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying Rito's is some of the best Mexican food I have ever had.  However, on many occasions including the last 2 visits, they failed to include part of the order.  I work in an office and we do tend to have a larger order than most.  The second to last order they forgot 4 orders of refried beans.  At $2.95 per order of beans, that's like $12 of food we didn't receive.  We talked to someone at the restaurant and they promised to make it up to us on our next order.  So that day is today and low and behold, we go to pick up our order and while checking the order in the car before pulling away, they have forgotten an order of tortillas!!  It's a good thing we had not left yet and have learned our lesson about checking our order.  A word to the wise, check your order for accuracy before leaving the establishment!!  *** Update ***  They also did not include a green chili burrito on the most recent order.  We'll be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  I have been coming here since I was a kid. Being mexican I am very picky about the Mexican food I eat outside old my home and compare everything to how my grandma makes it. That being said,  Rito's is by far the BEST place you can get authentic mexican food. I highly recommend the guacamole tacos.  You won't find them this good anywhere else. no matter what I get, I always get a side of rice and beans because they are amazing.    Con: there are a lot of other people who feel the same way as I do so there is usually a long wait and not enough space to wait. However it is well worth the wait. Everything is made fresh to order.   FYI - I am typing this as I am at Rito's waiting for my order. Looks like my orders up, gotta go!"}
{"text":"Best green chili burritos in the valley! Enchilada-style is excellent, but regular style is just as good. They have tacos and tostadas every once in a while, but I wasn't impressed. They just don't compare to the burritos. The red chili burrito is best with beans, enchilada style with a side of rice, but you have to go with the GREEN chili burrito first if it's your first time. I never get anything else now."}
{"text":"I think Rito's is overpriced for what you get. The burritos look huge because they use an over sized tortilla that hides the tiny amount of meat they use so most bites are filled with tortilla not meat. If the green chile burrito I ordered was filled with meat then maybe it would be worth $8. The beans were above average and I thought their salsa was amazing even though they charge 25 cents for two tablespoons of it. I expected to be blown away by the food here but it tasted just like the food I grew up eating. It made me want to hug my mom :)"}
{"text":"This is your typical Phoenix area \"canned-food-stuffed-inside-a-store-bought-tortilla-and-topped-with-cheap-cheddar-cheese-passes-for-Mexican-food\" kind of place. Check out Presidio or La Santissima for a really good, authentic Mexican food experience. Rito's is nothing more than your typical \"me too\" Mexican place.  My burrito was filled with a mysterious meat/sauce that came out of a can. In my world, re-heating something isn't the same as cooking it. Also, don't you love that little mound of lettuce they put on your plate as if that makes it healthy or pretty or something? Try picking through that after driving your food home in a to-go box. There's nothing like receiving nasty, wilted, wet lettuce as a cherry-topper to my \"tastes like it's from a can\" meal.  I really wanted to like this place, but there are much better places out there."}
{"text":"I had their enchiladas with beef, rice and beans and I think I finally found the best enchilada in town.  Careful, not to punch through the metal container though, it could cause a mess if you sit outside."}
{"text":"Awesome food. My favorite is the bean, rice, and cheese chimi. It's delicious! They are a bit pricey, but worth it. They could totally have a great chain if they would expand, but I don't think it's ever going to happen. My husband has been going here (it's a house, in a neighborhood, with some picnic tables on the side of the house) since he was a kid growing up in that neighborhood."}
{"text":"So this place is a lot of hype. The food is decent but unless you want to wait 30 minutes for a burrito while people who ordered after you and had larger orders get their food first, it's not really worth it. It may be OK if you can actually get the website to work and order online so you don't have to wait a ridiculously long amount of time."}
{"text":"I am so very sad that I don't work anywhere near Rito's, because I would frequent them for lunch if I did! Instead I am left with being able to go once in a while when I am either home for lunch or just happen to be in this part of town.  I was lucky enough to be in this part of town a few weeks back, which  was why I was able to try Rito's for the first time.   I went along with the many suggestions on Yelp and ordered the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style. I also ordered a side of Refried Beans. They were both full of flavor and worth every penny. I don't mind the price so much if my Mexican food is worth it!   The amount of food was enormous! I had enough for a snack the next day! I am looking forward to going back as soon as I possibly can!!  Thank you Yelp! Once again you succeeded in helping me find a really great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Best little Mexican place in Phoenix!  The chimis and burros and everything I have ever eaten here is amazing!  it's in the back of a house in the 'hood, and is worth the trip.  If you're going for lunch, getthere before noon to avoid the line that stretches through the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The BEST Mexican food in the Valley.Hands down.nothing fancy not even a spot to sit and eat indoors but if your looking for Sonoran-style Mexican food this is THE spot great green chile,the best tacos around and if you love re fried beans like I do,do not leave here w/o trying these,on a tostada,on the side,but if your not watching calories for the next month,in a burro w/cheese deep fried OMG! This would be my choice for a \"last meal\"  I challenge anyone to give me a better spot than this,and please do not say Carolinas because I will hunt you down and slap a B*#+*"}
{"text":"I cant believe it took 1hr and 45min to get my food i was disappointed when i got my enchiladas only 4 or five pieces of meat. My first time vwry disappointed. I wanted red chile burrows all they had was green mostly beans"}
{"text":"Guacamole Tacos. Green Chili Burritos. Literally the only two items you'll ever need to eat again. Every time I'm back home I have to go here. Do yourself a favor and make the trip."}
{"text":"I fear the backlash, but I must be honest. I thought it was meh.  We managed to get in before the crazy line; it helped that it was raining outside.  Got the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada style as recommended.  Good quality meat; sauce was ok. I think I would have preferred the burrito dry but with their hot sauce. Hubby felt the same about his Red Chile Burrito.    I'm always happy to patronize a local mom&pop place, but I don't see all the hype.  Am I just spoiled by LA Mexican food?  Perhaps."}
{"text":"Grew up in the neighborhood and still doesn't disappoint. Compliments on the upgrades to the building, but let's move up now from the cheap dollar store paper plates and napkins. Overall. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This by far is the most over rated green chile Ive ever has the displeasure of waiting an hour for! There are FAR better places in the valley that serve better green chile.. the tortillas however were awesome enough to go back for though with the lines of people I wouldn't even bother."}
{"text":"This place is real tasty! Red & green salsas are so good! The Green Chili Burrito that my fiancé got was so flavorful. It was a little saucy so next time he is going to order the burrito was rice and cheese. I got a basic bean and rice burrito with cheese and everything had so much flavor. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Let's face it folks, NOBODY goes to Ritos for the ambience or the warm fuzzy customer service. We know it, and Ritos knows it. They are in the business of GREAT. Mexican food. We know it and THEY definitely know it. Will you feel like a number and know that they probably don't care if you ever eat there again? Yep. Will I continue going back because it's no nonsense and I'm really there for the food, not the hugs and kisses? YEP!  If you are new to Ritos, know what you are there for before you go, this is overall an assembly line order, pay and pick up, and get out so the line out the door can move inside a bit more.   No frills, no inside seating, (who eats outside in 110 degree weather? Some do) plan on order and take.. Enjoy your delicious food in the setting of your choice, it just won't be inside of Ritos."}
{"text":"I've gotta go with A-OK on this one. Not quite ready to commit to being \"a fan,\" yet.   To me, being \"a fan\" would mean I would be willing to drive from North Central Phoenix all the way downtown, devil-may-care style on a work day, to wait in line and put up with the slamming of the metal door every time a customer's lunch order was fulfilled. (That's not a complaint, mind you. It was cool. All part of the charm.)  You see, dinner is not an option. They're only open until 4.   That said, I obeyed Robert M.'s instructions and ordered a green chile burrito, enchilada style with a side of beans. The beans were runny but good for dipping my bites of burrito. The sauce that made it  \"enchilada style\" had a good heat.   I was pleased. It was \"A-OK.\" I'd go back. Just probably not devil-may-care on a work day."}
{"text":"Now while i am not a huge fan of Mexican food...my  wife is and that is why i am reviewing this place...because she sends me to this \"hood\" on a regular basis. When we were here in June she went twice in the same week and i have already there again since we moved here. She loves the the Burrito enchilada style with green sauce and rice and beans. I promise you when you get this food they put it in a container that keeps it hot for at least 3 hours...and i mean hot people. Now there are only about 5 items on the menu...and i will post those pics as well...and you will see that this Mexican food is expensive.  Despite all of that though there is always a crowd at this neighborhood spot...and you will see people from all walks of life there for lunch every single day. Now noticed i said lunch because they only stay open to about 4pm and then they are ghost folks...LOL. So i have to say if you want authentic Mexican food and don't mind going to the \"hood\" to get it...it will be the best 8 bucks you ever spent on Mexican food...at least that's what my wife thinks...LOL. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"Busy busy busy. I'm slowly expanding my lunch zone as I get tired of all my normal haunts. Parking will be a challenge, even if you get there early. There isn't a ton of waiting room as the restaurant is a converted house.   Despite the huge swath of people eagerly waiting, my food was out in short order.   I've never been a huge fan of enchilada-style burritos, but man, was it worth it. The green chili burrito was simply amazing, full of flavor and a large portion for a fair price. The sauce had so much flavor, I wish I had something to sop it up.  If I feel like going on an adventure I'll be sure to head back out here."}
{"text":"I've frequented Rito's since the late 80's, way before it was cool to drive down through the Garfield neighborhood. One of the only positive things about working in the financial services industry is that no one seems to care if you take a 2 hour lunch in order to make your way in to \"the hood\" for some really good food.  Lunch crowds are a mix of locals and lawyers, lined up shoulder to shoulder in a line that usually makes it way out the door. Take a dose of patience and a big appetite (oh and cash.... no plastic here).  My favorite: the red mix burro enchilada style.... just typing that phrase makes my jaw shudder hannibal lecter style."}
{"text":"Muy bueno!  Here's a hidden treasure in the old Garfield barrio.  It's located right next to Garfield Elementary School, so if you passed the school, you went too far.    When you go in, it's like going into someone's house and ordering from their kitchen.  This place is a total hole-in-the-wall.  Also important to note that it is a cash-only establishment.  They only serve burritos & chimichangas NO TACOS.  Their burritos are extremely runny but extremely yummy and will literally explode in your mouth.  I recommend ordering a dozen tortillas on your way out.    Check out Rito's when you're feeling adventurous and wanna hang out the locals in the barrio."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here, but it was not vegetarian friendly.  They told me that they add lard to the beans.  It would be nice if they had a choice of beans to accommodate."}
{"text":"Got the red and green burritos with beef.  Both were AMAZING!  The beef was really tender and the sauces were perfect.  The red is more of a spicy sauce and the green is more salty.  I don't know which I love more, but this spot is excellent!"}
{"text":"Obviously Chuck-E M. doesn't understand Ritos.  You don't go here for horchata, water, or ambience for that matter.  You go here for one of the best green chili burritos in town.  The \"kid\" at the front desk has also been nothing but friendly to me and I go here all the time.  The lady at the front counter is a different story, you can tell she hates being there.  Please let me the restaurant in town that does a green chili burrito better?"}
{"text":"The best enchilada style burros in town.  And if you like New Mexican style food, possibly the best anywhere.  I go there about twice a year, yet think about it twice a week.  It's like a drug for me.  I have to ration myself fearing I'd become an addict.    I only go before 11:45 or after 1:30 for obvious reasons.  (Keep that between us please). There is limited outdoor seating and to-go isn't an option for me.  I couldn't possibly resist smelling the food while I drive back.    Tips: Bring cash Be weary of wearing a white shirt Expect to share your air space with a few flies.   The tables are mesh, so scratch anything white. Ritos 101 - Green or red chili burro, enchilada sytle...GET REAL!!!"}
{"text":"So we got here at 10 on a Saturday morning when they opened and still waited 25min for our food.... But holy moly it's worth the wait.. The freeking green chili burrito is just insane.. You could drink the sauce inside.  Cheap to boot!!  Do not miss this place no matter what!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  Everything I have eaten here has been delicious!  It's basically take out only, and cash only, with a small menu and a daily special.  As many have said before, GET THERE EARLY!!   Unless you get there before, or right at 11, you will wait, but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"So since I work downtown every once in a while,  when one of my co-workers feels up to it, he will make a Ritos run. Although I have never been to the physical location, I have to say that Ritos is hands down my favorite Mexican food place. I always order the green Chile burrito enchilada style with a side of rice and die and go to Heaven every time! I have also had their beef tacos with guacamole and the meat is so tender and juicy, it's truly amazing. I just wish they were open for a dinner run or on weekends so I could take my hubby."}
{"text":"It was just that A-Ok, nothing that special.  We got a red and a green burrito enchilada style. The meat was really tender, but other than that it lacked that over the top flavor I'm looking for. The prices are pretty cheap, and the place is definitely authentic but that doesn't always automatically put it in the awesome category."}
{"text":"The red chile burritos are perfect. This is Arizona style Mexican food at its best. Make sure to get there early, because when they run out they close up shop for the day."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The green chile is so good. I always opt for the green chile chimichanga enchilada style with a side of rice and beans. Be prepared to stand in line thereby losing every inch of personal space and potentially an hour of your time but if you go with these things in mind you will not be disappointed. This place is simple, authentic and not fancy but consistent turns out exceptional Mexican food take out."}
{"text":"Having just moved here from San Diego I have been dissapointed overall with Mexican food in this state UNLESS you feel like driiiiiving. Came here on a lark, ordered what other yelpers told me to, got home and was unimpressed until I started eating n couldnt stop inhaling my meal. UhhhhhMazzzzing is all I can say. Greem burro wet with green sauce is heaven, sides of rice, beans n chips make this is serious contender for best dish in Phoenix so far...."}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is good when your mouth waters when you're writing a review for it.   My go-to order, which I highly recommend, is a red chile burrito mixed with beans, enchilada style, with a beef taco on the side. Ooohweee! You won't regret it. I know it sounds like a lot of food, but I believe in you.   I have been going to Rito's ever since I was a little kid and their food has been consistently amazing all these years. It's still the go-to lunch spot for my dad and I. It's always has a good crowd every time I stop by. You see for yourself the following they have had for years. To me, Rito's is one of those places that come to mind when I think of great Mexican food in Phoenix. You might think, \"oh, that's just because you grew up with this food\". I'll let the food speak for itself, my friend."}
{"text":"One of the oldest and best Mexican foods I ever had.. I had the red chili enchiladas with rice and beans and it was out of this world.. definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I do not give very many 5 star reviews to restaurants but this place is hands down the best green chili mixed burro that I have ever had. We go here every so often for work and it is always a welcome treat. I happen to get my burro enchilada style with a side of sour cream and it makes it even better.   On top of burritos they also have tacos (but only on Tuesdays) and a couple other items. The menu is very simple and everything is homemade. There are many options that you can go to into Phoenix area for good Mexican food and this place is at the top for a good green chili burrito."}
{"text":"Was my first time eating at Rito's. I knew that I wanted the Chimi-Enchilada Style. My friend suggested I do the Red. I have no idea what the difference is. We ordered a side of rice and my friend suggested to pour the rice in the container over the sauce. It was very delicious. I am all for dives but this place was not the best set-up for eating in so we took the food to a park and ate it. The crowd is a nice mostly working class lot's of utility type workers. They only take cash and the drinks are canned but cold. Very simple limited menu but it is good."}
{"text":"It's been many many moons since I last had a meal at Rito's. I'm talking like 1994 and not much has changed, it is all so like back in the day.  I still get the feeling I'm visiting my grandmother and driving through the old neighborhood to get to the converted house to restaurant gives me the feeling of going home.    Today I had the red chili burrito enchilada style with a side of beans just like I used to have every payday when I worked at the local bank up the street. This burrito portion is huge and the red sauce was just a little over spicy like I remembered. I even had to wipe the sweat beads off my nose a few times.  So good, I'll say.  The menu is online, I called a head for pick up, I took cash, there is limited outdoor seating and parking might be an issue."}
{"text":"This place used to be really good. They made the best tacos (which they don't make anymore) and green chili. The green chili has gone down hill you can tell they are cutting corners. They have raised their prices which is completely unjustified due to the quality going down. This place has now become nothing more than an eye sore and nuisance to the local neighborhood. Close your doors and move on."}
{"text":"The green chili burro here may very well be my favorite food item I've ever had. There just isn't any green chili burro that I've had that is even in the same league...and my grandma lives in New Mexico.  I could eat Mexican food for every meal, every day...and sometimes I do. This though, tops them all. Others are great, but this place is special.  It's so good, in fact, that I've been here 40+ times and I've never even tried the red chili, which some say is better. The beef taco with guacamole is good and is the bean burro. All the workers seem happy and friendly all the time. The place is ran well - it's a staple. My brother had one last meal today before he moves to Denver. What did he choose? Rito's.  It's in the middle of the neighborhood with no sign; just look for all the cars and people going in and out with large boxes/bags of food."}
{"text":"I got the green burrito enchilada style..it was good food but not the best like everyone raves about it.  The other thing that turned me off was the wait.  I went there when it wasn't busy and took FOREVER  for my number to be called.  I was better off going to a restaurant get unlimited chips while I wait and faster service."}
{"text":"Green chile burro was great.  Going back for certain."}
{"text":"the sun shines again when i eat a rito's green chili burrito, and double rainbows appear when i eat the tacos."}
{"text":"The food is over priced. The restaurant has no place to sit indoors.  The exteror tables aren't even covered by a shade structure to protect you during the middle of the day when they are open.  They have limited hours. The food its self its okay, but I could get the same thing for a lesser price else where. they charge you per item, even the salsa 15cents for 1oz and 50 cents for 4oz.  No way!  Never returning here."}
{"text":"Best barrio (neighborhood) burrito stand in town for red or green chile burritos. Can't beat those tacos either, there isn't much of a menu. But this isn't a $8 or $15 high tone  Restaurant, these are Nana's (homemade grandma) meals. Cash only, and outdoor picnic bench eating also."}
{"text":"Get in my belly!  So I have been going to this place since I was little. There's nothing like this green chili. Only second best to my moms of course. I live in Arizona and I only have a hand full of Mexican food places I will go . This is one of them.  We took my itty bitty mother in law who eats very conservatively . She downed that bean burrito before we could even open our containers! My husband an I get the green chili chimichanga. Tastes like Christmas in my mouth. We only go on special occasions but the drive is worth it each time.    Now the hours are limited and it is a hole in the wall (well the hood). You will wait a while. Especially if you go around lunch time. However we think its worth it all."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Came with a group of eight and every one of us could not stop raving. The red & green chili burrito enchilada style was amazing. Quick service and plenty of outdoor seating on a nice Phoenix evening."}
{"text":"Being from Las Cruces, NM which is about 30 minutes away from the Green Chile capitol of the world (Hatch New Mexico), I think that I can accurately judge the green chile burritos to be sensational. I'm not much of a pork fan, (excluding bacon of course) which is usually what is in the burritos, so I usually just order a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style with green sauce. Green is the only way to go in my opinion. The burritos are huge, and are filled with so much beans, cheese, and green enchilada sauce, it's overflowing as soon as you take the first bite. It's always hot because they make each order fresh, but be prepared to wait especially if you go between 11-1. I try to only go after 1, but it's not uncommon to wait 20 minutes even going after the lunch rush. So if you have only an hour lunch, and you work downtown, you better be a speedy driver. I usually only have about ten minutes to eat after driving over and waiting in line, so that's definitely something to take into consideration.  It's a little hard to find at first because there isn't a sign, and the business operates out of an old house across from a school, but you'll know you're in the right place when you see the line up of cars for a block. The staff is all very friendly, but there isn't a lot of waiting room inside, and there really isn't too much space outside to eat either, so it's more of a grab and go kind of restaurant, which I don't mind because I probably would not choose to stay and eat there either, but you're going there for the food not the experience.  The only other downside aside from the wait, and the lack of seating and cleanness, are that the green burritos are twice as much as the red ones because they are so popular. I personally think that this is ridiculous, but obviously everyone is still willing to pay for it. All in all it's a great little hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix, and a must try if you are craving some delicious green chile."}
{"text":"I've just remembered another benefit of Rito's!  Hadn't been in months, but whilst dragging a Rito's virgin (my friend John) for his first visit, we lucked into a rare taco day. YAY!  But that's not the benefit... the new upside is what happened to my downside. I ate about 2000 calories and spent the rest of the day getting rid of about 5000 calories. Went in fast, came out faster!  Eat delicious food - lose weight. Nothing better."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a customer whose dad is a retired Phx cop that started bringing the family to eat at Rito's in the late 70's when they first opened. I think listening to his memories of the place and how it has grown over the years added to my great experience!  But I digress! All seating is outdoors so you go in and order at the counter (you can get to-go as well). They are so popular there is always a line. DO NOT LEAVE. The line goes pretty quick (after 40 years in business they have ir down!) and the food is worth the wait.  The  menu is spilt up into burritos, chimichanga's, enchiladas and tostadas...all with amazing sides. For the veggie they even offered veggie tacos and other things.  I got a guacamole tostada and a taco. I will say their guacamole is some of the best I've ever had and the salsa just the right kick.   They are located right at 14th and Garfield in Phx and  been voted Best in Phx and Best Chimichanga too many times to count!   Go find them!!!"}
{"text":"If your willing to wait, this isn't bad! Took me an hour to get there, order, wait, wait some more and get back to work.   The line was at the door when I managed to squeeze behind it. Waited a good 15 mins, which sucked because the waiting area was so small! Ordered the green burrito, enchilada style and chips and salsa.  Waited another 25 mins before my number was called.  Their chips and salsa, Egh. Nothing to comment about, wouldn't get again. The burrito was delicious, with the guacamole it brought it up a notch. The only thing, there was more tortilla than cubes of meat. Maybe get it with beans too? The option was there.  Customer service was mediocre, they just hammered out the orders in robotic fashion. With the line out the door the whole time I was there, I get it. I mean, do they get pee breaks?!  I'm already thinking about going back Saturday. Only at 10am instead of 1pm. Maybe it won't be so bad??"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!! It's only open for lunch and is always busy, so it's better to call in our order. I love the red Chile burrito enchilada style, it is my favorite. I recommend it to everyone looking for some great Mexican food."}
{"text":"I have been eager to try this place after several recommendations. Green chilli burro was amazing!  Probably the best I've had anywhere!  It was spicy enough I didn't have to add any salsa, the chunks of meat were tender and the perfect size, the sauce was runny but I didn't mind.  Their salsa is quite enjoyable as well.  I will be back."}
{"text":"It had been years since I had been back to Rito's, I was craving it for lunch and thought let's do an old school affordable lunch.  I typically eat Burrito's at the Lunch Trucks so I thought Rito's being in the middle of the hood, nothing fancy, outdoor seating and so on should be a quick affordable quick lunch for two of us.  We got our Two Burrito's after waiting almost 30 minutes in their lobby + the 10+ we spent in line? (I know I know...what did I expect going there between 11am-1pm...but seriously they have all the ingredients made, it's just an assembly line, Chipotle Style dang it) so anyway, the food took way too long and $17.49 later for one green chile regular burrito and one red enchilada style burrito with rice and beans (in the hood) had me complaining about my planned 'cheap' lunch before I took my first bite.   I'm not gonna lie the burrito's are tasty and a good size, other comments mentioned salty and greasy and yes that is true on both, but that's why the place is famous for its simple salty/greasy food.  I have had better for the same or less $$ and for a much better atmosphere...that place is making a killing they could have maybe some more shaded cheap/vintage seating a sign a mural something...give the place a little character and I can maybe feel better about spending my hard earned $$ there.  Anyway not my most favorable review but I think Rito's has taken their fame to their head and caters to the foodies/downtown administrative crowd vs. the working class and neighborhood area peeps."}
{"text":"Best green chile / tacos are amazing I would recommend if you like Carolinas Mexican  stop now come to a place that will treat you with respect and answer your call when you call to place a order. Keep on serving up great Mexican food Ritos !!!"}
{"text":"These are honestly the best tacos I've ever eaten in my whole entire fat woman life!   I'm not big on bean burritos but this place has these magic beans they get from a little Mexican guy name Javier... This bean burrito... Yeah, I wanna bathe in it.   Pretty much everything here is to die for."}
{"text":"Bean burritos and good hot sauce. Rito's is bomb.  Been coming here since I was a kid.  The bean burrito is still my favorite menu item"}
{"text":"Incredible! Charlotte, the owner, is great to deal with. I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure that my mom fed me Rito's bean burritos in the womb. My family has picked up takeout burritos from here since as far as I can remember. You know, back when (my hood) Coronado and Garfield neighborhoods were considered the ghetto instead of historic! :) That said, the building is small and traditional Mexican style with brick arches donning the ranch-style architecture and nothing more than a couple of plastic chairs to sit on while you wait for your order. I remember the days when this was the best kept secret in town, but I am glad they're gaining some more momentum and praise!   Quite simply, this is my favorite burrito of all time. Their beans are so delicious due to their salty, runny, lardy goodness, and I beg that they never ever change!  The tortillas that they wrap them in are heavy duty and freshly made and ever plentiful! There is nothing more original than these and nothing quite like them in the rest of the Valley! Hallelujah, Rito's burritos, you are fond memories in my past, part of the joy in my present, and I always look forward to you in my future!"}
{"text":"The bean and cheese burrito with GREEN sauce is by far the best thing I've ever eaten in my life, hands down.  Be prepared for nothing fancy they are located in a neighbor area and only have outdoor seating. But it's 100% worth it if you like burritos. They don't have a large menu so don't expect tacos and stuff."}
{"text":"I've been a fan for over 20 years. It's the first place I go to as soon as I get to Phoenix. I think I've tried just about everything on the mine but a red burrito enchilada style is my staple."}
{"text":"Green mix burro!  Different than your usual Mexican place but one of my favorites.  The burrito is soupy, which may not sound good but it really is.  Their menu may vary from week-to-week but their awesome Green Burros is always on the menu so I'm happy.  No indoor seating which is the only thing I hold against Rito's.  Great for picking up and eating somewhere else."}
{"text":"The tacos are the best & their guacamole is to die for!!!  Get there early or place an order prior the arriving."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I first ate there ten years ago and not much has changed. There is never, ever, anything bad about seeing a bunch of old ladies in the kitchen cheffing up the goods.  My personal favorite is the green chili mix burro. Tacos were awesome, but as long as the green chili, beans, and the perfect tortillas remain, I'm a major fan. I like sitting on the picnic tables with my paper plate and my can of fanta holding it down.   Bring cash. Be patient. I'd give five stars if they were open later. I've never seen them open on weekends. Anyone know if I'm going at the wrong time?"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Ritos for over 10 years.  In that time I've never had any inconsistency in my food. The best all around green chile and some of the best tacos in town.   Why the hell hasn't Guy Fieri put this place on DDD?!"}
{"text":"Red chile burro enchilada and bean tostada.  Rito's food is great!!  Order your food for takeout and go.  The ambience has improved - a couple of flat screen tv's and benches inside (there are also outside benches).  The food is soooo good."}
{"text":"Good Food, small location definitely a take out kind of place. They have some tables and chairs outside but with this AZ heat it's too hot to eat out there. For the  inconvenience of no inside dinning this place is EXPENSIVE! Food overall isn't bad but come on those prices are on another."}
{"text":"Found okayish food. They have a decent taste but too oily. Had rice n bean burrito enchilada style"}
{"text":"Most of the time its real busy but worth the wait. Green and bean mix burrito and a side of rice is the route i usually go. Beans are real runny which i like but some might not. Semi spicy food but ok for me, I like spice in my life!"}
{"text":"I just stop by here for the first time today! I ordered a green chili burro enchilada style! (red sauce)  it was really, really good! I usually go to Rosita's place for their green chili. (arguably the best in Phoenix) this is definitely right up there, and I will be going back to this place again soon!!! If you're looking for authentic green chili you will not be disappointed going to this place!!!"}
{"text":"Red mixed enchilada style. Tacos with guac. Homemade tortillas. The best.  I've been going here since '94, and nothing can beat their enchilada style. It is THAT good. If I'm feeling super hungry I will also order the tacos with guacamole.  This is one of those places that is hidden in a house, with an outdoor patio and no inside eating area, but the food is so good you don't mind standing in line outside in the 110 degree weather.  I would give them 5 stars if it weren't for their limited and inconsistent hours, the occasional sign that says \"Not serving enchilada style due to personal reasons,\" and parking.  But...  Anybody visiting Phoenix or living there who has not tried this place, is definitely missing out. It's a MUST check out regardless."}
{"text":"Limited menu options, but what's there is fresh and delicious. Be mindful that the place is packed usually and wait times can very. That's the only complaint I have. Haha!"}
{"text":"Not terrible... EXCEPT- I called in an hour before arrival and STILL waited 30 min for my food. I saw people who just showed up and got in line, get their food before me. REDIC! I suspect that they didn't even start making it till I showed up. I gave it 2 stars for lack of process. Food is 3 stars..."}
{"text":"Ritos has great food but beware about eating on their patio. I have been waiting for cooler temps. To enjoy the food w/out driving back to the office. We got our food and went to the patio as soon we opened our food we started getting attacked by flies. Yes you expect a fly or two when eating outside but there were a least half a dozen buzzing our food and table.    The problem they don't have covers on there trash cans. Above the cans were swarms of flys. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Waaaaay overhyped!!! It's slow, pricey, and the food is just average. There is also zero ambience, but I knew that from the reviews so I didn't care. A lot of these things can be overlooked if the food was the bomb, but it wasn't anything special. Part of it has to do w/ the crappy and confusing menu, so I didn't get what I wanted.  The menu is confusing and the cashier didn't really explain things well either. My food took 30 minutes to get and that was after waiting in line for 10-15 minutes in their non-air-conditioned building. The food was good but average and quite a lot of excess tortilla compared to the amount of filling, and the sauce was quite salty. What was $11 here would be $8 everywhere else so I don't know how they get away with charging so much given their location and building."}
{"text":"How could this have anything other than a 5 star review?!?!  All the losers that don't appreciate a small menu can... you know, shove where yo mamma don't wanna see.  The green burrito is amazing on its own.  Try the chimi-green-mix, or better yet, try the chimi-green-mix-enchilada style.  YOUR TASTE BUDS WILL HAVE ORGASMS!!!    I'm serious..."}
{"text":"Best food ever!!!  Just need tacos back.  I have been eating here since 1982 and have been a loyal customer ever since.  Best beans and green chili in town!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I think it really comes down to the tortillas and the beans but everything is tasty. I go for the green chile beef mixed with beans, enchilada style...it's a gutbomb but so worth it.  No indoor dining area, no alcohol, and no sign...I think that adds to the charm to be honest.    I do have just two gripes though...it takes FOREVER to get your food. 15 minutes minimum up to 40 minutes a few times when it was really busy. It seems like they don't try to complete smaller orders when there's a huge order in...so if someone orders 10 burritos for their office right in front of you, you're not eating until those 15 burritos are done and out the door.  My other gripe is the amount of meat in the burritos...there's barely any! But again, the tortillas and beans are really the stars of the show.  I highly recommend this place but be prepared to wait and don't expect a bunch of meat!"}
{"text":"Only one word to describe this place: AMAZING. I look forward to eating here every time I come to Arizona. The green chili burrito, enchilada style with green chili on top, is phenomenal. Just writing this review is making me crave this delicious Mexican food.  Nothing else compares at all."}
{"text":"So damn good! Green chili burrito enchilada style is the way to go. A local college student told me that's what he always gets and I took his advice. I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I seriously thought I was going to cry the day the sign went up:  No more tacos.  Sorry.  This is not a punishment!  ~Rito's  But in reality it doesn't matter because everything else on Rito's menu is so wonderful you won't miss the tacos. My favorite - red burro, enchilada style. Amazing.  A couple of things to remember about Rito's: -No inside seating, which makes it difficult in the summer. -No credit cards accepted. -They are always busy, so expect to wait. -No use in calling in an order. Every time I have I have waited anyway.  The last time I was there, my lunch companion said \"I love Carolina's, but this really is the best Mexican food in town.\" Even though I am a HUGE Carolina's fan, I have to agree.  P.S. Word on the street is they occasionally make tacos. If anyone wants to tip me off on taco day, I would greatly appreciate it!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! Get either the Red or Green chili burro Enchilada style.... and get some extra sauce too..... Most people seem to go after the green chili with red sauce.... I kind of liked the red chilli a little better... both spectacular!!"}
{"text":"Went there back in 2005 after reading the reviews on Citysearch before I left and couldn't pass up good Mexican food, even being from LA. My bf absolutely loved the place, especially the burros with chile verde and the chimichangas with red sauce. The tacos were great too. We sat outside and it took a while to get the food, but it was worth. I think it was the best meal I had while in that area. The only thing is that it's a little hard to find. I had a car with navigation, so it was a piece of cake, but it's tucked away in a neighborhood, so unless you're intentionally looking for it, you won't accidentally drive by it anytime."}
{"text":"My ex took me here a few years ago and when we walked in I thought to myself what the hell is he thinking and I refused to order anything, after he got his food he forced me to try it and I did. OMG it was so good we rushed back over and I ordered some tacos and have been hooked ever since.   The tacos are a little pricy and grease but they are the best, I have drove about 12 miles on a short lunch break just to get these addictive tacos. If you have never been you need to go but make sure it is after lunch and before 5.  Great food"}
{"text":"I visited the fabled Rito's for the first time today. For no frills traditional Mexican-American food, Rito's is as good as it gets. The zoning is strange. It's a converted house in the middle of a neighborhood. But I didn't find it dicey. It had a welcoming, comfortable atmosphere.   I came for lunch and didn't have a problem finding it as there was a group of cars on the street and people eating outside. I ordered a green burrito enchilada style and two shredded beef tacos.   It took about 15 minutes to get my food. I went outside and tried the tacos first. Excellent ratio of crispy taco shell with juicy shredded beef and iceberg lettuce with yellow cheese. The red taco sauce was good too. Not hot but flavorful.   The burrito was quite large, covered in melted cheese and red sauce with lettuce on the side. The inside was piping hot. The liquid inside oozed out when I cut into the tortilla. It's wrapped thick enough to soak up the sauce without getting too soggy. The pork was delicious. It's very tender with no fat and the sauce had a nice green chile flavor. The burrito is easily a meal in itself, but I wanted to try the tacos too. Both were  as good as I hoped.   I didn't try the rice or beans. I'd like to but they don't have combos that include them. You have to order them ala carte. It's not a pricey restaurant but it's more expensive than most hole in the wall taco joints.   There is no indoor seating area, and the menu doesn't have a lot of choices. But what they do have is flawless. The only place I know that has Mexican-American food this good is the original Garcias on 35th ave."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Enjoyed it for the first time one week ago and I had to go back for seconds today. They accept cards now which is great, as I've heard they only took cash in the past. Parking is tricky and it is wicked busy during lunch time.... But well worth the wait! I enjoyed their bean/cheese burrito with red sauce and a shredded beef taco. So Legit!"}
{"text":"We had an event around the corner and as soon as my associates figured out how close the venue was to Ritos they lost it. I mean the week before the event, in the emails the night before, and at breakfast the morning of,  people were not talking about anything else but the lunch planned from Ritos. I got annoyed and thought ok, they better not be making this place to sound better than it is. So lunch comes around and they return with our massive lunch order (I suggest calling in group orders ahead of time or ordering online) and damn, they were all right. This is real deal Mexican food, homemade in this little house. My chimi was fried perfectly, the guacamole flavoring was on point, and  but the price was affordable. The hype is true."}
{"text":"I can not say good enough things about this place! I have been going here since I was a child and yet nothing has changed. The family has continued to keep the same recipe which has history. Nestled away (not in the nicest neighborhood) it would easily be missed by people who don't drive through the neighborhood nor have the address.   A few years ago they had removed their tacos from the menu, but thankfully brought them back. I would highly recommend the bean and green mixed burrito. The meat has flavor and the beans, well.... Lets just say I have yet to try anything that comes close. A must try restaurant!!"}
{"text":"I was there yesterday 5-21-18.  I have been a customer for many years but yesterday disappointed I picked up food to take home.  The taco was overcooked almost black and so greasy it even leaked thru to the brown bag.  Burros had a small amount of meat I had ordered 2 beans only received one order I was not charged for two orders.  It was  so noisy in there she even asked twice about my order.  After spending 25.00 + I was unhappy."}
{"text":"My favorite downtown place for Mexican food! The guacamole tostada and red chili burro enchilada style are both absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"After reading all of the reviews on Yelp on how amazingly delicious this place was, I decided to try it.    First of all, it was good...but not to the point that every one else is making it seem here. I think with all of the hype, I was expecting little pieces of heaven in every bite!   I ordered the bean and cheese chimi enchilada style. I can say that the enchilada sauce was really yummy! I wish i could have finished it all but it was HUGE!! it is a good lunch spot but definitely order ahead because the wait is pretty long. If it is convenient I would probably come again but wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Green chili chimichanga enchilada-style is the way to GO. I got the plain green chili burro and was basically making my own enchilada-style with the sauce, guac and other toppings from my boyfriend's plate. It was amazing.   You pay extra for the enchilada-style, for guac, for cheese and even for extra hot sauce (it's homemade). Though still not expensive, the pricier your meal gets, the more delicious it gets. It's worth a bit more to add extra flavor to the burros, which I actually thought was rather plain without my doctoring.  Rito's is a cash-only take out place with some picnic tables outside, and at lunch time it was hopping with people. The only negatives I can see are that it's set up sort of like a bank teller, so you feel quite disconnected to the staff the whole time. I also couldn't find the bathroom to wash my hands after my messy food, nor could I find any extra napkins."}
{"text":"Maybe one of the best bean and cheese burritos I have ever eaten....except the beans were so runny it was like thick soup in a flour tortilla.  The place is in an old house with seating outside, cash only and just like Chipotle there are 3-4 items on the menu.  Either you get a burrito, chimi, or tostada with either beans, red, or green chili.  You probably cant go wrong with anything here since this place has obviously been open here forever and the service is OK but that is how it goes with authentic Mexican food places.  I'll go back soon...."}
{"text":"I have been going here for over 20 years and it never disappoints. I always get a bean burro enchilada style and a taco. I think eating it out of a tin pan adds to the experience. They have the best beans and best red enchilada sauce I have ever tasted hands down. I live in southeast gilbert and make the trek at least once a month. Worth every mile driven. I wish they'd open one on the east side."}
{"text":"Love this place. Only joint where I don't mind a wait it's that good. Green Chili Chimi is fantastic! Enchiladas are fantastic, the tacos are good, honestly we love this place. Call ahead to avoid a long wait during peak business hours."}
{"text":"Yasssss! So good! My mom told me about this place and I am forever grateful for her! They have these guacamole tostadas that are to die for! The outside of this place looks sketchy but the food is sooo good! This place gets crazy busy, so you may have to wait a while for your food, but it's truly worth it. Please note, seating is very limited. This is a great takeout spot but not a very great dining in place. They do not serve any chicken dishes just beef. But their guac tacos are yummy! And are my fave. Anywho stop by if in the area! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The burros enchilada style here is hands down one of the best I've ever had. I don't have much else to say because it is just amazingly good. You just have to go and try this place.  The location is really in the middle of a residential neighborhood so you may have a difficult time finding it."}
{"text":"Sort of conflicted on this one....food is off the charts! So is their Salsa, but their service takes FOREVER....even when you \"call ahead\" it doesn't seem to help. It's almost like calling ahead or ordering on their app just gives them a heads up on needed ingredients...because when you arrive there's still a serious wait time."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST beans in Phoenix!!  Area is sketchy and it looks like someone's Nana's house, but this is definitely a home town favorite!   If you are in the downtown area make the time to try them out... Well worth it!!"}
{"text":"The menu is simple and the portions are huge! Be prepared for a line out the door. They are no longer cash only!"}
{"text":"I am from the San Francisco Bay area, on business in Phoenix. Let me keep it simpler and straight to the point; Rito's makes the best wet burrito  that I have ever had, the tender seasoned beef, and rich smoky enchilada sauce is absolutley incomprable. You must be able to 'move,' in a real neighborhood so if you are the 'coorprate,' type, keep your sorry behind in the hotel! If you are, however, a real person who likes real mexcan, A Rito's burro is as good as it gets!   PS-really friendly customer service, and sweethearts behingd the counter make for an even better experience!"}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing.   Homemade fried tortillas.   It is a busy place.  It is best to order online or call ahead, even if you are eating there.   There is limited seating outside."}
{"text":"I had heard much of the mythical burritos at Rito's.  I'd just never passed by it or knew where it was so I always forgot to seek it out.  But I am kookoo for cocoa puffs about green chile and had heard this place had the best in town.  One day recently, I was driving around the Garfield district looking for a possible new pad as I want to live downtown.  I was driving up and down each block looking at rentals that weren't totally sketchy.  It's and up and coming area, but it's still a pretty rough neighborhood.  As I was driving down 14th st. past a grade school, I spotted people standing in a short line out the door of a converted house with picnic tables outside.  A light bulb went on in my head.  Aaaah, this must be that place they talk about in the magazines and papers.  Rito's!  It was 11:30, so I parked, which would probably have been difficult if I'd gotten there 15 mins later.  The menu is just burritos and tacos and beans pretty much.  There are plaques all over Rito's walls from year after year proclaiming it to be the burrito king of Phoenix.  I got a green burro and a side of beans, waited about 5 mins for my order and went out to a picnic table to dine in the sun.  I shared a table with some other folks and a pigeon.  They are not big on ambiance here.  What they lack in that, they make up for in pure, unadulterated burrito kick-assery.  The beans, hot as molten lava and a bit soupy, were the most flavorful frijoles I have ever, EVER tasted.   The hot sauce, heavy on the oregano, was lovely with good heat for me. The tortilla was thin and chewy with just the right bits of char kissing it.  The green chile filling, again a bit more soupy than I'm used to,  was just sublime.  I couldn't have eaten it without a knife and fork though, cuz it would have oozed all down the front of me.  Make sure you ask them for a knife and fork; they don't just put it in the bag.  They do take debit cards now, I guess it used to be a cash only business.  Boy, am I glad I just happened upon this mythical burrito abode!  I felt like I was in one of my friend's Nana's house at a family party.  This is down home Mexican food greatness...'nuff said."}
{"text":"Surprise!  Surprise!  Who would have thought such a place by it's looks would be so busy and have such great food?  It does.  We were a group of ten and this place was recommended.  It's not fancy and not in the business area of town.  You stand in line to order and stand in line to pick-up.  Tables are outside for you to eat on or you can take it home.  The food is fantastic and the people are super friendly.  Even the taco shells are made here.  No commercial ones served.    Just wonderful as many others have already discovered!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Rito's. I've been going here for years and absolutely love their mixed green chile burrito. But you truly can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Who knew a corner house would make a great eating spot. First time comer couldn't make up my mind; the young lady had to start over twice. She was patient and helped me with my final decision. Customer service an A++ Cleanness an A++ Quality of Food an A++  Will I return and tell friends & family... But of Course ;)"}
{"text":"They have the best green wet burrito I've ever had wish there was one in northern California!"}
{"text":"Ohhhhh man, that enchilada-style bean & cheese burrito.... I want another one, but probably not for at least a few weeks after the last one -- it was huge. This place had been on my list to try for quite some time, even after I had done the initial scouting and was waiting to develop an appetite for the awesomeness I was promised. I love that the menu is short and sweet and the food almost overwhelming -- both unassuming and carefully prepared in jumbo size. It was just about all I had hoped for, lacking only in unicorns and rainbows, and I love that it exists despite its terrible curb appeal and total lack of ambiance."}
{"text":"Amazing green chili ! Absolutely loved it ! Nice service. Little small but the best food ever I came around 1:14 I waited like 15 mins for my food."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of enjoying their anniversary special for a few precious days--Tacos were back briefly! Too late now, but those are some delicious corn treats. Green chile burro, succulently meaty and delicious as it is, comes second. If you're reading this, you're already ahead of the game--can't believe my dad never told me about this place."}
{"text":"The food is good, the only issue I had here is they didn't get my order out to me. I was waiting for quiet a while and they asked me what # I was, I told them they said I should of came up sooner since they were way past my number,  I was like okay? I don't work here so I don't when my food is up and they don't even call the numbers in order.  That was the only issue. But food is good."}
{"text":"This place is the place to go for some hearty Mexican food for lunch! You go inside the house and order and take out or eat outside. There is a wait time but be patient because it is totally worth it. I have only ever had the enchilada style beef green chile  and  beef red chile burritos and they are so scrumptious!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once but I have been dreaming of them ever since. It is real home cooking with care."}
{"text":"I had the green chili enchilada style with rice and beans.... oh my heck.... so delicious.  Lots of great mexican food in Arizona!"}
{"text":"it does Not get more REAL than this my friends.  As I journey deeper into the Mexican Culture I find so many jewels.  Ritos Mexican Take out steps out to be a staple for what Phoenix has to  offer.  Wow, Green Chili Burritos! I love the bee burritos, and defiatly has a spicy kick to it.  Take a Venture into a Phoenix neighborhood to find great burritos and tacos on Tuesdays.     Ah the Haters,   this place is so good it has started a small group of haters blogging about their disappointment.   I find this hater yelp phenomenon in many great restaurant concepts.  If so many people love the place the force is balanced with a group of haters that must respond to so many positive comments.    Destination location for sure  Let me know what you think,  Kevin"}
{"text":"So lucky to have such an amazing restaurant across the street. The tacos and burros are outstanding!  I'm updating to five stars because riots has the best enchiladas I've ever eaten. Best beef and guac tacos. Excellent hot sauce. If you aren't eating here I'm sorry for you:("}
{"text":"This place is great.  No name on the building, somewhat sketchy neighborhood but the burritos are oh so delicious.  The green chili is to die for.  Ne inside seating but a little patio outside."}
{"text":"This place is affectionately called the \"soupy burro\" around the office. On my way there, my fellow lunchies warned about three things:  1)Be cautious of the aluminum plate they serve the burro in, its 2 degrees hotter than the deepest realm of hell and will singe your arm hair if you get too close.   2)The enchilada style burro with a side of beans is two parts molten lava, one part devils breath and two parts awesome. Be warned.  3)If you happen to get the burro traditional (without enchilada sauce) try it Gary style.(He's a guy a work) Get a side of rice with your burro and eat directly over the rice bowl because the burro WILL explode  at some point and it is better to catch the molten lava goodness with your rice than on your pants. Unless you want to melt your legs off.  All in all, it is good stuff. Small menu, outside seating, cash only, No sign on the building. Sometimes you have to arm-wrestle a junk-yard dog for a place to sit but its worth it."}
{"text":"OMG! I love this place! The green chile burrito is to die for! If you are to try this place, call ahead! The wait is long(reason for the 4 stars) but well worth it!"}
{"text":"No tacos!!!! without the tacos...... I won't be back but loved the tacos.......I used to rate it 5 stars... The taco sauce was great too... You could still taste them four hours later.  the line out the door unless you show up before 11 am. the lack of parking. cash only. nasty falling apart tables with zero shade unless you want to sit under that tree on fresh bird shit. No more tacos. No more Ritos. I had this stupid friend from New Hampshire  who tried to go at night and a cop asked him what the hell was he thinking? The cop said get the hell out of here! It was testament to how good the tacos were though."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, this was pretty amazing Mexican food. Thank you Yelp. We would have never ever ever have found this place otherwise. They are located in a neighborhood and as of the time we paid a visit, they did not have a sign. It is a brick building that probably used to be a house, and we had to drive past it a couple times to realize we were there. They have a very simple menu, but I am not surprised they have found success with their amazing quality. We shared a enchilada style green chili burrito with beans on the side. WOW. It had cubed pork in it, but I was in love before I even hit any meat. The flavors are so delicious and all of the sauces together were perfect. The beans were super yummy and tasted very fresh and flavorful. We ordered a shredded beef taco that was a special for the day just in case the burrito wasn't going to be enough for the both of us, but it ended up just stuffing us until we couldn't breath. That taco was really good too! It seemed like they freshly fried the taco shell and they were very generous with the beef! Next time we will definitely be satisfied with just the enchilada style burrito to share since it was mighty large. Can't wait to come back for more!!"}
{"text":"I came to Ritos after a client recommended I try them if I was true authentic Mexican food! He was correct. Outdoor seating is awesome and relaxing. I had the chicken tacos along with chips and guacamole! All of it was great. I will 100% be back"}
{"text":"If you like burritos, add this place to your rotation!  Homestyle burrito heaven. The flour tortillas are oh so soft and fresh, the beans are savory, it's served hot. The salsa has a great flavor and is chilled enough to meld perfectly with the hot food. I'm so happy this place exists in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The best enchilada style burrito I have ever had.   If you catch them on a day they are making tacos... you are in for a treat.   short and sweet :)"}
{"text":"Best green chile burritos ever! This place has been around at least since the mid 80s. It's a house on the corner converted into a little family restaurant. If I'm the area for lunch I have to stop here!  Outside seating only. Mostly locals."}
{"text":"I usually order the same thing at every Mexican restaurant I go to, a chimichanga. This was the best one I've ever had. I went during lunch rush so there was a bit of a wait, but it was well worth it. For the money I highly recommend this place. Visiting from Florida this was exactly what I was looking for, quality and authentic."}
{"text":"This place is so good and so cheap, but most of all, it's so RANDOM. It's on a lonely stretch of street across from a school in a residential neighborhood. You'd never know it was there since it's not on a major thoroughfare. And it's on such a quiet street that you'd probably drive by thinking it's just someone's house. The only giveaway is the small courtyard with the picnic tables next to it.   I unfortunately discovered Rito's too late in my time living in Phoenix. I only ate there a handful of times before I moved. They have what I call the diarrhea burrito (unfortunate nickname, I know), not because it causes stomach upset, but because it is so wet that if you are a newb and try to eat it off the plate, its contents will inevitably gush out of the bottom and onto your lap in a rush of sauce and meat. Like a burrito with diarrhea.   All of the burritos are wet burrito style. I prefer the green to the red. It's huge, so if you forgo extras, like rice/beans on the side or chips and guac, that might be a smart idea. Unless you are sharing a plate or going family style.    Make sure you do not try to eat this burrito as a wrap-style. It's wet, and its wrappings with safely ensconce it until you puncture it, in which case it WILL mess everywhere."}
{"text":"Just what the doctor ordered, when I need my burrito fix. Their beans are like no other, and their tacos(I prefer the chicken) hit the spot, too."}
{"text":"best burritos in Phoenix, quick, quality that you don't find many places.  If you happen to come on a day that they are making tacos too you have to try them!"}
{"text":"Not what is claims to be.. to be honest i was really hoping to like this place.. because of all the good review. But it just didnt do it for me. No meat and no flavor.  I recommend  Espos mexican food in chandler az.  Way better.  More flavor. More meat.. same still of food more everything. Better prices too"}
{"text":"Totally impressed. Have had the three-way and the red chili and beans. Not sure if I have had a better burrito."}
{"text":"Well, I finally know where Rito's is. It's in the hood, surrounded by scary shit I don't like.   Went to Rito's for lunch (don't think they are open for dinner nor would I go if they were) on the day after super bowl and every creepy tattooed head cholo in the neighborhood was there. I was freaked the hell out through my entire meal wondering if I should really be there. I grew up around these people, in Maryvale, and regularly go to Sunnyslope and have no issues. Maybe it was the fact there were no other white people nearby, and I was in the middle of a residental neighborhood, which made me feel as though I had walked into some gang's territory.   I was still able to eat my meal though. I ordered the red chimi enchilada style. OH SNAP! That was the best chimi I think I have ever had. The food here is not eally cheap perse, but it is a cheap restaurant if that says anything. I wholeheartedly felt that I would go back on a regular basis if not for two things 1) it weren't in the location it's in and 2) it weren't so high fat.  At least go try it once, and take CASH."}
{"text":"Ok so one warning they do not accept anything accept cash. both the red and green burritos are amazing the tenderness of the meat shows they take time making it. The menu is small and straight forward seating is all outside. Place can be hard to find for the first timer so watch for a red brick building with metal security doors at 15th St. Garfield. Now I'm craving it...haha oh one more thing its only open for lunch."}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick lunch. There is only seating available outside, so the summer months may not make this an ideal spot. The burritos are huge, too! Get the green chili burrito mixed with beans enchilada style...trust me..it was a great suggestion .passed on to me."}
{"text":"Green burrito enchilada style beats most burritos in the valley (up there with green chile pork from most wanted and green chile beef with jalapeno cream cheese from mucha lucha)... the location is what gets me fired up!!"}
{"text":"THE best beans ever!  Their Green Chili is also awesome.  Guacamole/Beef tacos are great.  I always had that in my order. I missed those when Grandma had eye surgery, but those have been back on the menu for a while. I have tried about everything on the menu and love it. I started coming here since the early 1990's when I started working at County Hospital.  I go less often now that I have retired, but still get there a couple times a month.  The staff has always been fantastic to me.   Cutter"}
{"text":"This addiction started with my mama,  she would take my husband and I to get green burritos enchilada style and a Coke.   We would go to the park and have the best lunch ever.  This was in the early 90's.  She isn't here anymore,  but when I eat Rito's I think of memories with mama.   They have the best green chili,  it's spicy but delicious.   I'm sure their other food is just as good (but I still keep eating just the green chili burros).  I would love to see more locations with later hours. Thank you Rito's for the memories and unforgettable burros."}
{"text":"Thanks for the solid review Gina  Went today foe linch  Mouth still on fire and loving every minute of it"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the green chili burro.. Was more liquid than meat.. so many good rating.. yet disappointed... Carolina's is the best..less money too. has a rest room and dining area."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!  The red cheese enchiladas were amazing!  Beef taco rocked!  Beans were super runny but loved the flavor and loved every bite.  The rice had great flavor but was a little to mushy for my taste.  I prefer my rice more on the dry side. We ordered a green chili burrito enchilada style and the green chili was FANTASTIC!  I wasn't asked if I wanted it with red or green sauce and so I found out that they made it with the red. I was disappointed about that because I thought the green chili had green chili sauce.  The other disappointment was that the burrito was kind of deflated.  It barely had anything in it so it was more like eating a tortilla in every bite without the green chili.  For the cost of it I would have expected to get at least more green chili if they wanted to skimp on the beef.  The little green chili that I did get was delish!.  I will try it one more time but if I get another empty burrito, I will have to skip it.  Don't want to have to do it but I don't want to get teased. I still want green chili damn it!"}
{"text":"Best burrito in town. It's hard to pass up a restaurant my grandpa grew up eating in, in the neighborhood he grew up in in the 40s."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Ritos since whn they 1st opened.  I know a couple of the family members.  Although I don't go often, it is hands down the best place to get anything green.  It's alittle hot for me so I always get it mixed with their delicious beans.  Whn I get it enchilada style(almost always) it's so big and filling, u don't need any sides with it.  But the rice is also very good.  Now the meat they use is big chunks and very tender and the green chili has so much flavor but it is spicy hot for me.  Now I have eaten in a lot of Mexican restaurants trying to get that same taste from other green chili burros and in different states( NM, CA and Texas) but there is no comparison and there \"enchilada style\" is like no other and I doubt u will ever find it like tht anywhere.  It's the cheese,  it's almost like a good pizza combined with the tasty red sauce.  I have tasted some of the other dishes like the tacos which are very good but I wish those were bigger.  I just crave more.  Thts why I always go back to the green burro enchilada style.  It fills u up and it's damn good.  And they finally went plastic.  I have been waiting for that to happen for years making Pete's Fish & Chips the last place tht only takes cash. Lol.  So go eat at Ritos and experience this place for yourself."}
{"text":"This is another one of my absolute favorites in AZ. I've heard some folks pan on other boards but I just flat out don't get it. For people visiting AZ, this is a must go imo. My relatives visiting from Australia requested it as their last meal on their way out of town.  First of all, I'm not a big green chili fan. Second of all, Rito's green chile burro is one of my top 3 bites in all of AZ.  Tortillas are amazing (homemade), beans are amazing (I guess I'm still a big fan of lard). Unbelievably, beans seem to get even better when you microwave them from the fridge the next day too.  I love the character of the place. It's run by a mother, her daughters & some other relatives. They do what they do & are who they are & don't really care beyond that. I've heard it compared to the Soup Nazi from the Seinfeld episode. My first visit, I did get that vibe but the ladies have been super sweet many, many times. It is a bit tough to find, they have short hours, they only take cash and as the sign says, do NOT approach the window on your cell phone.    I think at present they quit making tacos because they were too much work & the mom has had some health issues. So basically you get what you get. I say get the green chile burro.  So they are who they are & do what they do, take it or leave it. I love it.  As far as the shop, it's basically just a barred window counter you order from, you pick up your food & go outside & eat on picnic-like tables.   They are open only M-F from 9 - 5ish. Close even a bit earlier on Fridays I think.   They're on 14th street just south of Roosevelt right across from the school. You'll just see a screen door & that's it. If it's around lunch time, you'll probably see a line as well.  I think the short hours & no evenings, no weekends even add to the obsession for me. Scarcity makes it even more desired.  Right now, I cannot believe how much I'm craving this food.  BTW, the warning about scalding food & soupy burrito are right on. Ended up with a bunch of scalding green chili in my lap my first visit."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I drove 40 minutes out of my way to have one of these great green chile burritos...I was at least expecting pulled beef, not beef squares.  The sauce was decent, had a good kick, but there was wayyy too much of it with no chips to eat it with? SHAME on them for no chips and salsa!!!!! For $8 there was very little amount of beef inside swimming in green chile sauce-How did they get all that green chile sauce to stay in there!? We ate it on the picnic tables outside in the 107 degree heat while we got bitten by ants.  It's a pretty sketchy neighborhood, so I would make this a lunch time experience if you must try it for yourself.  Come packin' some heat if you don't want to end up like 'boys in da hood' LOL"}
{"text":"This place is great. Everyone knows that the best mexican food can either be found in businesses located inside of a strip mall or an old house. They stick to what they know, the green chile/bean burro was ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Oh man! I normally love mission style burritos with a ton of different things in them but this place makes me love one ingredient burritos. You cannot lose with their green chili burrito. I prefer getting the burrito enchilada style because the sauce is absolutely perfect and it is covered with cheese. (who doesn't like cheese?)  Its a no frills place with a simple menu and everything is great.  Tacos are not served every day but if you happen to be there when they are being sold they are worth trying.   If you go to phoenix and want awesome take-out mexican food; this is the spot."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Rito's for a while so we finally stopped by.  We used their online order menu very easy to navigate and customize each order.  Food was ready when we arrived (about 20 mins) they even provided a nice cardboard tray so enchilada sauce doesn't spill all over your car.  We ordered the 3 way burrito, beans/rice combo burritos all enchilada style and beef green Chile enchiladas.  Everyone was very happy with their order we will be back soon."}
{"text":"Rito's is located within the downtown Garfield district- restaurant was a house converted.  Don't let the location or appearance scare you - it's a must try.  No inside table seating - outside seating is offered.  It'a an order and take out type establishment.    The food is amazing - I've been going here for years.  The tacos are my favorite - the meat is seasoned perfecting with the perfect amount of fresh produce. The salsa is provided on side and it perfect in spices."}
{"text":"Red burro enchilada style with rice and a Diet Coke. Eat it out on the patio with the stray dogs. I love it."}
{"text":"Yes, the green chile is very good. But the long wait can be difficult to bear and the burritos are approaching $6 a piece.   With that being said this is some of the best green chile I have had in Phoenix. It is mildly spicy with fresh onions and tomatoes, and lean chunks of tender pork. I certainly appreciate that the meat is not accompanied by layers of fat, which I have experienced at other valley eateries. I must confess. I love me some tasty pig and this slightly-too-thin sauce is just squealing for more. Nearly double would be about right.   Rito's also needs to add some combo plates to that barren menu. Give me a green chile plate with rice, beans, and flour tortillas for a bit more than a solo burrito and I will repeatedly frequent your establishment. Currently if you'd like some rice and beans with your burro you're lookin' at $8 plus for your lunch. This is not Scottsdale! Some claim that this place has \"the best\" beans. I disagree. They are a bit too salty and runny. On the other hand the rice is simple and satisfying. Also, while not made in-house and instead purchased from Mama Lola's, the tortillas are still quite good.   In a nutshell visit Rito's if you appreciate some tasty green chile and have lots of time to spare and patience to endure the long line and longer wait. I would recommend going early or late to avoid the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Yeah the food is great, up there with the best Mexican stands in a town that competes for the best in that category anywhere. Rito's has a loyal following who are inured to the hardships of no parking, long waits, and cramped quarters. I think their red chile burro is excellent, but prefer Carolinas. My wife had a wonderful bean chimi, but again in comparisons with Azteca and others, there is no clear cut superiority to our thinking. So when we are near, we will check it out. If there are long lines we'll keep moving. It's not so special to endure the discomfort and slightly aggressive pricing."}
{"text":"Ahhhmazeballs! My favorite red and green chilli burritos in town. Fresh, spicy, flavorful, and their tortillas are soft and homemade. I've bought 8 one day and shared them with my coworkers. Their taste buds were also in heaven. There is a reason why this place has been in business for so long!  Go there today!"}
{"text":"\"Green Chili Burro, Enchilada Style, Green Sauce\".  That's all you need to know.  I've never tasted anything better.  Yeah, it's busy, the service is slow. So what?  It's awesomely delicious!"}
{"text":"The beans are so food you can drink them. The guac tostada is an excellent choice of you're looking for something \"light.\" This is a definite must try."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ritos in ages but I had to try my favs..red mix enchilada style with a side of rice and beans! The beans are the best in town! So flavorful! Red chili is spicy but not overwhelming. The rice is tasty all by itself but mix it with their hot sauce and you'll have a party in your mouth! I ordered two beef tacos..two words, de lish! Hot pulled beef with lettuce and cheese and put the hot sauce on and you're in Mex food heaven! Bring your cash and your friends! This place will not disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Green Mixed Chimi, you are the death of me!  Rito's is the In and Out of mexican food. Made with great products and frankly their lack of selection is what makes them so good. Make good food and make it right.  Best Chimi that has ever entered my mouth.  My waistline is somewhat grateful that there is not a chain of Rito's especially with in 10 minutes of my house. Rito's is always a treat when I am downtown working.   Oh and the counter help is pretty easy on the eyes to.... And they laugh at my jokes so hey, winning!"}
{"text":"The green chili burrito is amazing and crave-able, have a very nice taste.  Reasonable prices, and the quality of their meat in the burrito is fantastic...never fatty.  It does get very busy in the winter season, so come before noon or you might have longer lines to contend with."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Rito's for a long time, but their hours are fairly prohibitive  (only open at lunch time when I happen to be working). I finally made it over spring break and it was fantastic! I never would have known this place existed without Yelp, as the building is on a side street and doesn't particularly look like a restaurant from the outside. Anyway.... once you approach the location, you'll know you're in the right place by the long line coming out the door.... It's that good. I went with my dad and we shared a green chili pork chimi, a guac and beef taco, a cheese enchilada, and chips and salsa. Everything was tasty, but the green chili was by far the best. It was just the right amount of spicy and flavorful. I would highly suggest going to try the green chili pork in any form... you can thank me later. I will be back ( schedule permitting :-P)!"}
{"text":"I love the green burrito!! The meat is never fatty always lean."}
{"text":"I have been eating the tasty bean and cheese burritos at Ritos since I was a kid.  30+ years later I bring the family and they all enjoy the burritos just as much as I do.  Interesting to see the changes in the business now that the younger family members are taking a more active role in the operations.  No more bars on the ordering window, they accept credit cards now, trying new menu items, staying open later, and now you can even order via an APP. Mira Que Fancy. .  Check it out if your in the area, good eats!"}
{"text":"Yummy Mexican food! I'm not a big pork eater, so my burritos generally always consisted of beans, rice and cheese. Their beans are the runny kind, so adding the rice made the burritos easier for me to hold and eat. Their nicely seasoned fried chicken and beef tacos were the best (even the oily juices tasted light and fresh). I also regularly bought their delicious enchiladas.   The menu isn't huge and they don't stay open all night. I think that is SMART.   Ritos is just another one of those very unique places that you come across every so many years. You won't find the same type of food anywhere else, so you wish you could take Ritos with you if you move away.   It's like your mom's cooking. No one else will cook dishes quite the way she did. She added her own special touch."}
{"text":"Had the Green Chile Burro Enchilada Style, with Green sauce - as recommended. La Bomba. I am going to try to frequent this place in the future. I enjoyed the experience. Plenty of customers from all walks of life; Businessmen, families, etc. When I came up to the counter, I was greeted by some very friendly and upbeat employees, and when I asked \"what's good here?\" they replied \"the service!\". I totally agree. About $20 for two to eat your fill, and have a nice relaxing lunch on the patio at the benches. Even the hot-ass 103F plus sun didn't seem to faze me until I was walking back to the car... A PHX favorite. Who says we don't have culture in the Valley??? Oh yeah, CASH ONLY - NO ATM. Grab a $20 at the Circle K around the block."}
{"text":"First found out about this place during the last Chile pepper Fest in Down town Phoenix. I had sampled a mini red chile and green chile burrito! Boy they left me wanting more! As a Tucson Native and been used to the delicious red chile at the San Xavier reservation, had not found anything like it here in Phoenix. I had to go back! Nice little hidden spot between homes near the Roosevelt District. This last time I ordered the RedChile burrito Enchilada style! Cooked to perfection! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the SECOND time I've received a piece of hair in my food!!! The first time, I was almost done with my food so I just threw the rest away. I let it go. This time I'm angry because the wait time was insane and I was very hungry. After today, I will not be going back. It's really sad because I loved this place but it leaves me wondering how many other times I ate my food with hair in it? I just can't imagine. Please make sure your staff is wearing hair nets!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now with a buddy. The place is a dump but the Mexican food is the best in the valley. I recommend it to everyone but I also recommend you get there before 10:30am because this place gets packed! Red burro enchilada style with 1 beef taco. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING!  The green chili is my favorite, but the red chili comes in a close second.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is VERY difficult to spot if you've never been there before. It is located across the street from an elementary school's playground in a nondescript brown brick building. Look for the metal gated doors - that is the entrance. There is no parking lot, you just have to find a spot to park in the street.  My coworkers and I arrived here about 11:45 today, thinking we were going to beat the lunch rush, but we were wrong. The person in front of us ordered about TWENTY burritos to-go, so it took our food a pretty long time to get out. I would say we waited about half an hour, which kind of sucked. But the food was really good just like all the other reviews say! I ordered the rice and bean burrito with green chile sauce. I think $8 for a burrito is pretty fair, especially considering I could only eat half for my lunch and will be eating the other half for dinner tonight. Plus it's always nice to support a local business. Next time I think I'll try the enchilada.  Oh and they only take cash and they seem to run out of coins frequently, so if you have exact change that is even better. And there is no seating inside. I think they have a few tables on a patio outside, but most people typically take their food to-go."}
{"text":"Love the food in here and cannot to get back and have some more authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Seriously best whole in the wall Mexican food! The menu is simple and they perfect everything on it. I highly recommend the green chili burrito. Careful it's addicting."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. We got the 'renowned' Green Burrito Enchilada style. The wait was about 15 minutes, but the staff was nice. However, the food wasn't that great ($10 a piece isn't that cheap either).   One thing this place gets right is portions. They're huge.  But that's the only good I can say about this. The \"meat\" is mystery meat. I had no idea if it was chicken or beef or pork or veal or lamb or Buffalo or cat or dog or vulture. You get the point. It was cubes of mystery meat. The inside of the burrito tasted like old frozen Marie Callendar's chicken pot pie. All in all, I was going to walk away very full...until I found a long hair in food. It was long straight and swimming in my burrito. I was instantly disgusted and dumped it in the old tin trashcans, which symbolically were surrounded by flies.   I will not be back at Ritos. I'd rather go to Taco Bell honestly."}
{"text":"One of the best burritos I've ever had. I like the red chilli enchilada style the atmosphere is how I grew up, the people friendly like family. It's a trip for me to get there so I don't go as often as I wish I could but I love it when I get to go."}
{"text":"i won't say how i and my (former) coworkers discovered this place...but i am soooo glad we did!   two words:  green chile.  add it to ANYTHING on the menu, and it's fantastic.  ;) anytime i am in this part of town, this is my go-to place for a meal.  period."}
