{"text":"Great variety of smoothies, clean, and quick. Smoothies are around $6 and are very satisfying. I used to drive to Mayfield to get Pulp. So happy that there is now a location in Willoughby."}
{"text":"I go in regularly and get the same thing everytime it's become almost a daily routine. Usually it's a \"hi what can I get for you today\" but Sunday was a different story... Sunday I had walked in there were a bunch of workers but one stood out the most by the way her friends were leaning around talking to her the entire time making other customers feel a bit uncomfortable. It felt like gossip hour more then a smoothie place. Just not a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Smoothies are mediocre, also no truly healthy smoothies available. Don't see a point in getting enhancers put in like \"fat burners\" when most all of their smoothies have sherbet in them. One of their energy enhancers is red bull... Really?? Nothing special, IMO just as good as a smoothie from mcdonalds. Actually mcdonalds smoothie might even taste better..."}
{"text":"The spicy turkey wrap was very good. The service was really fast too. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"This place is sooo yummy ! We were in and out very promptly with our delish smoothies. We also bought a couple shots of wheatgrass which was also a plus. I love that you can add pulp enhancers with every smoothie. Made me feel healthier just being in that place. The staff was very helpful and the store was inviting as well. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff!! My favorite Pulp location! I'm a huge fan of the King James smoothie and a Chicken Caesar wrap on spinach!"}
{"text":"Awhile ago I stated I would not recommend this location due to rude service and poor smithies that this location makes. Well my family suggested that I go back to see if things have changed.   On 3-24-2015 my family and I came in and ordered some smoothies. The gentleman at the register was friendly and very attentive. But the smoothies we received tasted watered down again and were not even filled all the way. I asked the female who served the smoothies , is this the correct amount? She replied , this is what we give and walked away.   Once again this location has failed to meet my expectations and I am not impressed with the way this place is run."}
{"text":"I really like the smoothies, wraps, and acai  bowl. Everything is always very fresh. I work close by and it's a great place to pick up a bite to eat on my lunch break. I'm usually out very quickly with healthier food than most of the other options nearby."}
{"text":"I've seen reviews of other Pulp locations popping up here and there. This Mayfield Heights location opened up in July, but for some reason there are no reviews yet.  Pulp is a great addition to Mayfield Road. In a sea of fast-food crap, it's nice to know that I can drive only about a mile to Pulp from work when I'm craving a healthy wrap or smoothie instead of trekking to either Legacy Village for Tropical Smoothie Cafe or to Robeks on SOM Center.  The smoothies taste great and even the \"kids\" size is more than enough. They're a little bit more pricey than Robeks, but I believe the experience at Pulp is far greater than that at Robeks. Here's why:  1) You can swap/add/mix and match any ingredients you like for no extra charge. This came in handy when I saw a smoothie I liked, but didn't want orange sherbet in it. So I asked for vanilla yogurt instead. Another time, I added honey to a smoothie. The great part is that during my first visit, the person behind the counter explained all of this to me so that I knew in advance that I could, in essence, \"create my own smoothie.\" This aspect of excellent customer service makes Pulp stand out.  2) The space is larger than any Robeks I've been to and includes some couches. While they didn't seem exactly comfy, at least there was more of an option than steel high-top tables.  3) The food is better. I would highly recommend the PB&G wrap, which is simply delicious.  Anyway, next time you want a smoothie, I would suggest you give Pulp a try. You know it's addictive when it's freezing out and all I can think about is going out to get another frozen concoction!"}
{"text":"Worth the money. Top notch ingredients and customer service! Awesome add, Willoughby! I've just moved back and this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Didn't think I would like anywhere besides robeks but this place is pretty good. The workers seem nice and we never have to wait long at all for our smoothies. The store is clean and we will definitely be back for some delicious smoothies again. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"So ewww my fiancee and I went to pulp in mentor and the girl with long brown hair was making smoothies WITHOUT gloves . so I asked her to put on gloves and she responded\" do you both want gloves\" I did yes so she then tells the other girl\" I can't make theirs you have to because they want me to wear gloves\". Um yes I don't want your poop filled hands touching our smoothie.... just gross plus I'm sure that's health violation. And they don't wear hair nets... Just gross"}
{"text":"I got a \"protein packer\" smoothie which consists of peanut butter, chocolate, whey protein, banana and soy or almond milk. I can't stop drinking it!! I also got a spicy turkey wrap which is good but the smoothie is better. I would definitely suggest stopping by."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see a legit juice and smoothie bar in Mentor! The menu has the typical offerings one would expect to see and there is something for everyone. I settled on the Pina Coolada after a confusing, albeit funny chat with the owner  (see below). They also have wraps and salads which I am looking forward to trying.   My only small gripe was that I searched for the menu online before I went and found what I thought was the Pulp website which had an amazing array of juice blends and smoothies. I arrived and went to order the drink I saw online and thats when the owner said that they don't yet have a website. Confused, i told him that I definitely was at a website that had the same logo as the one on his menu. Well...apparently I was at the website of the Pulp locations for the United Arab Emirates which wasn't even technically part of the Pulp in Ohio! Long story short, they don't have a website up yet so if you are looking to see the offerings ahead of time you'll be SOL."}
{"text":"This is where I go for a healthier milkshake. I am pretty sure most of the smoothies on the menu are packed with sugar but they do taste good. The green tea smoothie is great and the protein packer is my go-to order."}
{"text":"They have the best smoothies in town without a doubt! My favorite is the three berry and my husband said the strawberry banana is really good too. They have so many to choose from and out of the three that I've tried they were all delish! The staff is also very friendly and they let you know what smoothies are the most popular. When I ride by this place it's hard to not stop and get a smoothie. If you're a smoothie lover this is definitely the place for you, and if you're not a smoothie lover become one...you'll love it:-)"}
{"text":"We are regulars at pulp and want to be able to give this place a fair review. I had a pleasurable experience the last time I went ! We ordered sandwhiche sand smoothies which were delicious. It did take a while because they were fairly busy and we understood them taking all the orders before making ours. It did take about 18 minutes for us to get our smoothies. Luckily we have a very good toddler who was fine with waiting and ordered her one of there big cookies to hold her over.  We went in today however and my husband entered first and paid for his smoothie without my coupon. I had a bogo and was going to get a smoothie ! I came in one minute after he paid and asked the girls I I could still use it.  She was like nope. Not no sorry at the least.   So I ended up heading somewhere else for my lunch !"}
{"text":"Pulp has turned into my favorite smoothie place. Unlike another smoothie bar, Pulp has 3 different size cups! The Elite 8 with a shot of whey protein is my recommendation. Oh and there is no additional charge for the first shot!!! Some places charge an additional dollar!! There are plenty of choices, so even my picky kid has a fave!"}
{"text":"Don't know what is going on today,  but only 2 girls working.  It is taking over 20 minutes to get our drinks.   Saw one lady ask for refund because she had to go.   Girls are nice, but bad planning.   They need at least one more employee working."}
{"text":"Come here semi often for breakfast.  Lots of healthy unique options and all of the employees are super nice.  Haven't had a bad experience and all of the smoothies are tasty!"}
{"text":"My husband is a fan of their smoothies. I've tried a few of the flavors and they have a weird taste to me, probably because of the juice they use to blend certain flavors. I decided to try the apple-carrot-ginger juice today and I enjoyed that much more.   There are tables/chairs and also a sofa and TV so the vibe is pretty chill. The staff is very nice and make the drinks quickly.   3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"It's the only place I'm buying my juices from. I think it is the best priced place and the owners and staff are great at accommodating you.  You can pay $10 for a 32oz juice and add all the veggie and fruit you want. They also do fresh locally grown wheat grass shots. Just go."}
{"text":"I had a wheat grass shot and a protein shake last sunday after my kick boxing class and both were SO good!"}
{"text":"I had a Guava Burner (Guava juice, mangos, strawberries, bananas, orange sherbet with fat burner and fiber blend enhancers) with an energy shot and a Spicy Turkey wrap.  Both were good and even though they were busy it took very little time for my food to be prepared.  The inside appeared to be clean and comfortable. Some people were sitting on their laptops enjoying some delicious food while browsing the internet. They offer couches and a few high tops. This is not a place I would generally go and sit to eat though. I took mine back to work with me to enjoy.  I prefer pulp over Robeks because Robeks does not offer the food items that pulp has. Robeks only has 'bowls' which are just smoothie ingredients in a bowl. However, I visit Robeks much more frequently because it is closer to work and the location is easier to get in and out of during high traffic lunch hours. Since robeks does not have sandwichs I simply get a 6in subway sandwich next door."}
{"text":"Love their smoothies, have a lot of flavors to choose from.  They mix several different items together, not a 1 fruit type of place. I have almost tried them all here over the years and they are always delicious.   They do have food as well, never tried it but the smoothies always bring me back."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the great service! The Pulp Colada was everything I wanted and more. Came in 5 minutes past closing and the owner welcomed us in with open arms. Such a sweet guy!"}
{"text":"Everyone is always friendly and nice here.   The smoothies are delicious and well made. I feel it's a healthier alternative to ice cream.   I was going to have chipotle and an ice cream cone tonight but realized I could have a large smoothie for way less calories and actually get some nutritional value from it too."}
{"text":"Very cute juice bar! Great smoothie has Guava Burner! Yum and Asian chicken wrap also yummy."}
{"text":"Healthy smoothies. Great after a workout. Add a shot of whey protein for muscle boost. I like the KING JAMES (LeBron) full of greens with a nice flavor. Healthy and delicious. Plenty of chairs or couches like a coffee shop with FREE WIFI."}
{"text":"Fast service and a decent price. Overall it was good. Will go back. They have a huge selection of smoothies and wraps."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful one of the only juice and smoothie bars in the area is this good! Plus, it's right across the street from Chipotle and provides a quick, healthier out for my sometimes poor lunchtime decisions. The workers are always fast and friendly, no matter how busy. My only \"complaint\" is that the menu tends to stick to fruitier, sweet smoothies and doesn't really incorporate anything like peanut butter, chocolate, etc."}
{"text":"I had the mango tango smoothie.  I also tried the spicy turkey wrap. It was very good.  The employees were very friendly.  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm glad a smoothie/juice place opened up on this side of town. I haven't had a bad smoothie yet & the service has been fast and friendly every time. A medium is huge and the cups they serve the smoothies in help them stay cold for a long time.   They have a bunch of business cards to advertise for other local businesses & have a few tables to sir at inside.   The matcha match is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Pretty good so far. Tastes good, friendly fast service. But they look at you crazy when ask \" what's in the powder mix add-in\"."}
{"text":"My 3 friends I were at pulp today and we were sitting at the bar seat by the window and we pulled up two chairs from the next table. It's not like their was anyone else there, the place was empty. We decided not to buy anything because we decided to see a movie and didn't have enough money for both so we left and as we were leaving someone yelled at us \"thanks for putting back the chairs\" I usually love pulp but that was that was annoying. Def wont be going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Amazing \"Mango Tango\" Smoothie. My friend ordered the spicy turkey wrap and loved it! The chicken Caesars Wrap was delicious! New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Pulp is the spot for smoothies around the Willoughby area. I have been to this place easily 2 dozen times, and my hands down favorite is Pulp Fusion. It's an energy drink smoothie with strawberries, bananas, some other berry I forget, Red bull!!, and then your choice of extra boost. Normally I get Whey Protein but this day I got Immunity because it's spring time and there are germs flying everywhere.   If you are at all familiar with Roebek's or Jamba Juice then you get the idea of Pulp. Try the three Red Bull smoothies they have, they are awesome, all the wraps they have are really good and their menu is deep! If you are new take your time and figure out what you want. They have a ton of juices and smoothies to choice from. Just make sure you go! I promise you'll be back again."}
{"text":"I bought the Elite Eight Smoothie and it is delicious!  The two young ladies working were very friendly and eager to serve.  It was my first visit and I questioned them about the menu.  They were helpful and honest.   Since I only live a little over a mile from their location, I will visit whenever I want a good smoothie or a wrap."}
