{"text":"At the hill again for lunch.  Hot crispy wings and homemade soup while the car gets inspected next door.  Great way to pass the time."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of food and beer, we have never left disappointed or hungry. Hill Burger is always a home run, the French dip is excellent and can't go wrong with their sweet potato tots. I usually try something different every time and the staff never lets me down with their recommendations."}
{"text":"I really like this place: the food is excellent and very fresh, the restaurant is very clean and spacious, and the 3-4 people we interacted with during our dinner were friendly. Very laid back with a great bar and open feel. Excited to go back...."}
{"text":"Very good food and good selection.Love the BLT with an egg on it (just like my family has always made them) Onion Petals and HBs are very good. Friendly staff.I support all eateries in Mint Hill and recommend The Hill."}
{"text":"Great Food Great Prices!  I highly recommend you check out The Hill; they have a tremendous atmosphere!  I've gone with my wife for an evening few drinks and watch the sports games and brought our son the following day for a family dinner.  Great Wings- I am sort of a self proclaimed wing expert and was impressed!"}
{"text":"I grew up in a small town and since moving to Charlotte it's hard for me to find a place with a small town feel. This place is it. It's small and simple with great food and great service. I can't say enough good things about it. It's my favorite place!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick snack and a drink and also new to the area.  This is only my second time here and I have felt most welcome both times!  On this visit Brittany was the bat tender, training a new waitress on a fairly busy day.  She was the best and maintained such a positive attitude to all in the craze!  High accolades to Ms Brittany and the whole gang here, including the folks in the kitchen"}
{"text":"The food here is wonderful, with a nice variety and a special pop among other local bars in the area. However, last night the place had terrible delivery service during dinner. It took the waitress more than 10 minutes to get to to our table, drinks from the bar took more than 10 minutes per round, our appetizer took more than 25 minutes and then our food was equally as long. We should not have been charged for an appetizer that takes more than 25 minutes. We never saw anyone from management. The waitress was very apologetic about our experience and very kind, despite clearly having too many guests to manage. Some items on the entrees were cold while others were steaming hot. Restaurant has great food, needs more than 2 servers and one bartender during rush hours."}
{"text":"Food is ok. Typical bar food. Wings are mediocre.  Never have had great service here. Our waitress this evening never once stopped by to ask how our food was or offered to fill our drinks."}
{"text":"Laid back with enough attentiveness from the staff to make you feel very welcome. You HAVE to try the Turkey Cuban. Prices are great and the beer is cold. Can't ask for much more. I just found a new \"regular\" place to go."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after living here for five months. Definitely will be back. Everyone's food was really good. Crab cake sandwich was awesome."}
{"text":"The hill is great!!! Best food in town!! French dip is amazing!!! Very clean place. Definatly recommend this place. The owner CERTAINLY built one heck of a business!!!"}
{"text":"I've been a couple times so far and I can say it's a nice little bar/pub. Their food is pretty much \"bar food\" with your standard fried pickles, wings, pizza, burgers and such. I've had the wings as well as the fried pickles. The wings are well prepared (a little on the smallish side) and with every Thursday the wings are only 50 cents which is a pretty good value. Nothing really notable about the friend pickles. The drinks as well seem to be reasonably priced so you can go in, have a meal and a couple cocktails and still get out for under 20$.  The inside is fairly basic. Bar to the right, seating to the front and left and kitchen and bathrooms in the back. A couple big screen TV's and jukebox. Still though, it feels comfortable and welcoming.  The service I've had there is pretty much average. Same server both times and she got the orders right checked up on us as much as we needed but wasn't overly friendly or neglectful either way. The owner (or general manager?) did stop by and check to make sure everything was well which is good to see that they are paying attention to how everything is being run."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. This is our new Goto for wings. I have found no better in the area for hot Buffalo style wings. Service is always good. Parking is on the sparse side though. There is always a lingering bathroom cleaner smell though, which I find odd."}
{"text":"This place is somewhere between a three and a four star place but gets the \"local bonus\" for a place that is just around the corner (if you're in Mint Hill), has wonderfully friendly staff and prices that don't have an uptown Charlotte premium on them - meaning: this place is really cheap compared to city places!   The food was slightly above average quality for this kind of place and I like that it also accomodates people who prefer a somewhat more healthy choice for their meals. They have vegetarian things and a raw vegetable side (nothing fancy, but hey, at least it's there).   The restaurant/bar is nice looking, clean and fairly modern, and on most nights it's pretty busy, so people must like it! Good place for a simple, affordable weekday meal out.  TAKEOUT: I don't think I'd recommend getting take-out food from here (which they do). I was in the restaurant one time when an unhappy customer came back and returned a bag of food he had no ordered. One time I did get takeout, it was all cold ten minutes later when I got home, because the hot sandwiches are not wrapped in foil or any other way that would keep them warm, and a friend's philly cheese steak sandwich had *zero* cheese on it."}
{"text":"Great family pub, something for everyone on the menu.  Good beer selection, good prices and great staff."}
{"text":"Been to the Hill a few times now, mostly for their wing nights and I can say its a quaint hometown little grill and bar. It is definitely a lot nicer then the original Mint Hill grill and deli. The hill offers full beer, wine and liquor with some good beer selections. The menu is as to be expected for a local grill and bar. Not upscale but good quality sandwiches and appetizers. It is definitely one of the best places Mint Hill has to offer"}
{"text":"Nice local bar and grill. I had the chicken salad sandwich. Very tasty on toasted whole wheat. Food and service was good will recommend and visit next time I am in town."}
{"text":"We recently moved to Mint Hill from the South Park area and have been exploring what our new home has to offer. The Hill is not the kind of place you drive 20 miles for. But it is exactly what you want in a neighborgood bar and grill. Good food, good prices and friendly service. It is so nice to have a place close by where the staff makes you feel welcome and you can tell they enjoy working there. Just what we were looking for and we look forward to becoming regulars."}
{"text":"Service has improved drastically from earlier visits. Last couple of times we stopped in were great experiences. Wings are good, chips are really good and the veggie burger is excellent. We've been visiting more frequently now that they have improved the customer service."}
{"text":"Fresh yummy food at decent prices. The staff is pretty friendly. It's  jazzed up bar eats with a comfortable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Service was painfully slow on a Friday night. We were seated right on top of the air vent so it was blowing cold air on me. Then it took our waitress forever to bring refills. She was really sweet and apologized for the 45 min wait. The Italian sandwich was just okay. They literally put it on a smooshed hot dog bun. I didn't pay $8.95 for a hot dog bun sandwich.  Drink specials are worth it, just not the food."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the 50 cent wings here on Tuesday and on Thursday. I like to come here after a long day at work and enjoy them alongside a cold beer. The wings I usually have in \"Hill Style\" flavor which is a sweet and spicy deal. I'm eager to try other things on the menu. More to come...."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, and cold beer!  The Black and Bleu Chicken Pita is awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch one Sunday, my first thought was this was def. the local hangout! The place was packed with people and the bar full of people watching Sunday football. It was really loud in there but I didn't mind, people were just getting excited over the game.  We had the fried pickles for an appetizer which were good, a little greasy but good. I originally ordered the zucchini burger but they came back several minutes later and told me that they were out so I ordered the veggie sub. I wasn't all that pleased with the sub but it could have been worse. I ordered the homemade chips as the side which were delicious. I would love to go back and try the burger some other time. They have a few local beers on tap as well which is nice.  If you are in the area this is a good place to stop for food."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed The Hill yet, it's my local goto for amazing cheeseburgers and special fries!  My food is ALWAYS good, and my favorite server Brittany ALWAYS makes sure I have a great dining experience.   I also totally recommend the wings!  They have a nice bar as well, and the interior is decorated in such a way as to encourage you to be comfortable and enjoy yourself.     The owner really believes in customer service too, the one time I had an issue, he apologized, fixed the issue and comp'ed the entire meal for both my date and I, despite me telling him that it was not necessary.     So The Hill has earned my patronage through a combination of great food, great staff, and a dedication to customer service."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I have ever had! Great atmosphere, friendly servers, good prices.  We have been here twice in two days. We will return next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"We had zucchini sticks and chicken cesar salad. Delicious. Excellent service. We will be back."}
{"text":"Moved to Mint Hill a few months ago and always saw that this place seemed to be packed so I decided to try it.  It was quite good.  Kind of like a Hickory Tavern sort of place, which Mint Hill already has a Dunwellz, which is basically the same thing, but I liked this place better.  It wasn't as busy on the inside as the parking lot would have you believe, because the lot was full but there were still three or four free tables, but it was a sunday night, so I imagine Friday and Saturday it would be full to capacity.  I ordered the Chicken Salad sandwich and a beer and was satisfied with my meal.  The fried pickles were a good appetizer too.  I would come back here and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a bar with good food here in Mint Hill."}
{"text":"We tried a few different things, typical bar food items, to get a feel for the foods served.  Fries with Bacon and Cheese, the Fries tasted great, were crisp but light on cheese and bacon. I would have added more and gotten it through the Fries more not just over the top. The Wings were mild as asked, so right on with the heat, good flavor but ours were a little overdone. Moist chicken is preferable to crunchy for us. Onion petals were good but not home made, so you can't go wrong there. However....they had the absolutely most amazing burgers! My favorite was the Hills Piggy Burger, with Swiss, Tomato, Mayo. I think to have it with onion would have over powered the meat and egg flavor. They did an awesome job, juicy, nice size portion and great flavor. They weren't crowded and the noise level was fine, staff friendly and attentive. We will definitely go back again, to try a few more sandwiches to see if consistent. You can get bar type foods anywhere, but a great burger/sandwich is hard to find and nice to know where to go when you want a quick bite to eat. I think we'll try them for Lunch next time!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a few times and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  The staff is friendly and timely.  Good place to have a sandwich in Mint Hill.  Much better than the previous Mint Hill Deli that was in this location up until 2010."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times  and each time the food was good. The service is excellent!! The wings and onion rings are  My favorite.  I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"My first visit to The Hill was very enjoyable.  I had the French Dip and highly recommend it.  This is not anywhere close to \"classy\" or high-end....it is simply a good neighborhood joint with good food, pleasant service, a dozen TVs, and a friendly feel to it."}
{"text":"The first time we tried to go to the Hill a few months ago, it was a lackluster experience, and we didn't even get as far as eating. A sign was up saying to wait to be seated, and we did. In fact, we waited quite a while, and although the staff was milling about and one employee even came over to adjust the TV right beside us, no one offered to seat us or even greeted us. They were busy (they always are--there's not many options in Mint Hill), but it seemed rather egregious, so we left.  Last week we decided to give them another try. This time we went for lunch, and were greeted by a sign instructing us to seat ourselves. We did and were promptly served. The food was better than I was expecting (the fries were excellent and my turkey Cuban sandwich hit the spot), and our waitress was friendly and attentive.   The first experience was 1 star; the second was 4, so I'll give them 3 overall. The Hill is worth a try if you're in the area. Just be ready for some bumps if they're overly busy."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!! The Owner is Top Notch!!! The wings are awesome !!!  Great Bar and food!!"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife for the first time yesterday, and it won't be the last. We live right around the corner from here, and I'm surprised we hadn't come here sooner.  The Hill is nothing fancy. It's a neighborhood pub through and through, and that's not a bad thing. Their menu consists primarily of appetizers and sandwiches, and they have a great selection. My wife had the cheesesteak sandwich, and it was great (I ate half.). I had the fried bologna sandwich, and I enjoyed that as well. I can appreciate any menu that even includes such a sandwich. There were a lot of others on the menu that I wanted to try, so that made decision making difficult.  The beer selection was decent, with the usual domestics and some local varieties from OMB. Bring in some Birdsong!  Finally, the service here was great. It took a few minutes to be seated, but that was because our hostess was also the bartender, our server, and was bussing tables. Despite having so many jobs to do, she did them well and was very friendly.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great Value. Very good service. Food was awesome. Started with Hill Wings- very tender & big. Sandwiches also very good. Will be back."}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of the french dip, and the fried pickles are amazing. It's a great place when you're not sure what you want to eat, they have a wide enough selection that you can always find something delicious that you want to eat. love it@"}
{"text":"This place is really good. So far I've had the French Dip and the wings. I didn't like the Hill style wings, but the hot wings were delicious. The French Dip is thin sliced London Broil and it is easily one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The prices are reasonable, it's out of the hustle and bustle, and the service is good. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Great bar food with good pricing.  The staff is great and very attentive without being overbearing.   If you want bar food, this is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"We are moving to the area so decided to try some local places to see what we might like. Today's choice is stellar. Not fancy but super comfortable and relaxing.   We were greeted and served right away by a very friendly waitress.   I got the special chicken blt with the best sweet potato tots I've had in a while. My husband got the pastrami with fries. We both enjoyed the meal, atmosphere and staff.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The BEST fried pickles EVER! made fresh daily. Fabulous service.  Fresh ingredients. Husband really liked his burger. Families, couples, people of all ages were there. We'll be regulars for now on."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a loaded bar and grill menu.  I tried the chicken salad sandwich.  It was tasty, but you need to like walnuts because there's a lot in there.  I got the sweet potato tots for a side and they were really good.  The wings at the table beside me, looked and smelled really good!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out twice and dined in twice. Had great experiences twice and not so great the other times (slow service/messed up order). I really want to love this place though since we just bought in the area recently and there are not too many options in Mint Hill.  Will definitely be back and hopefully can update the rating with another star."}
{"text":"Should I use the word \"great\" in this review, just so that I can feel like I am one of the cool kids?  Or does that usage count?  I will say that the old incarnation of this restaurant was much less enticing.  The Mint Hill Grill & Deli was not appetizing in any way other than the name.  I hate that a business closes, however, especially one so close to my house, so it was good to see someone come in and take it over.  When The Hill opened, the first thing I noticed was that they were packed at just about any time of day.  Now to be fair, they do not seem to be open for breakfast (the old place was not either), and they are also closed on Sundays - but lunch and dinner has this place hopping, so I had to stop in to see what was going on inside.  The old \"deli\" counter has been replaced (refurbished) into a bar, and there are a handful of tables and some flat-screen televisions.  But other than that, there is not much different on the inside.  What really changed was the menu and the staff.  New offerings are much more appealing, served up quickly and the staff is one of the friendlier in town.  Definitely worth checking if you head out this way."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to visit on the drive down towards Charlotte. The atmosphere is of a small town family bar. Great food (I suggest the fried pickle slices) and friendly service. Plenty of tv's to watch the game it keeps a stock of good cold beers. Great spot."}
{"text":"With the hill you get exactly what you should expect. Chicken wings, beer, and some other decent bar food. The place is just a relaxed bar and grill with a blue collar vibe. Very family friendly as well. Beer selection is good and they rotate taps. They could improve on being slightly more knowledgeable about the beers they are providing. Wings on Tuesdays and Thursdays are discounted, while they may not have many flavors they make the ones they have absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood Bar and Grill.  We eat there at least once a week and always go away happy.  It starts with the great staff.  You can count of being greeting like a friend and neighbor.  Throughout your meal they will take special care of your every need.  The food is wonderful.  Everybody loves their Hill Style Wings. Just the right blend of hot and sweet.  The Hill Burgers are a crowd favorite.  Big and juicy and fixed just the way you want them.  The Crab Cakes are delicious.  My wife is from Maryland's Eastern Shore and these are the only ones that she'll order out.  The French Dip is big and meaty.    Get there early and beat the crowd.  It's a small place and they fill up pretty quick."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area, we were looking for a local bar to enjoy. I do feel bad  giving The Hill 3 stars because the food wasn't bad and the bartender was super nice.   The food is mostly all fried which I suppose is expected. I got a hotdog on a pretzel bun and it was delicious! My main issue was the crowd - it seemed as though the wait staff was very involved in sitting around chatting with the locals about gossip.   Prices of beer is very reasonable so that's a major plus in my book!"}
{"text":"We just love it!  We are working our way through the menu. Their feature Burger is excellent. we haven't found anything on the menu we don't like!  Friendly wait staff. Neighborhood atmosphere."}
{"text":"There were a number of little issues but mainly the food was the biggest problem. I had previously called and specifically asked if they served cocktail drinks to which I was told yes, so my biggest complaint is that I ordered a piña colada and was told that they don't make it because there's no blender.  I researched this place quite a bit and felt it would be a great choice for a night out. I was disappointed, the place from the start was empty eventhough it is a small space. Ordered the pastrami and I know it isn't supposed to be dripping grease, it was not a pleasant meal, the side house chips were unsalted and burned. I know we will not go back to this place."}
{"text":"Not pretty. But love the Hilly cheesesteak. Reliable bar food and good wings."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Glad to have found this spot so close by! The chicken salad and pimento cheese are worth getting some to go home as well!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and have been to The Hill twice in a week. The food is awesome. It's great to have a local place to go get great, fuss-free food and a drink."}
