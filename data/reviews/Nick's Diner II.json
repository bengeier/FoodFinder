{"text":"had breakfast Friday, was great. could not believe I cleaned my plate. that never happens.  new location is beautiful and huge. no waiting and much brighter and more open. very happy."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfasts and lunches!  Great service and big portions, the food is excellent. I've enjoyed their skillets and patty melts."}
{"text":"Love to take our family to Nick's. Have been here for breakfast and dinner many times. Never have been disappointed. Good size portions at an affordable price. Feels like a family owned local business which is a bonus."}
{"text":"My go-to Far West Valley breakfast spot. First and the foremost, before we even talk about the food, the coffee is like a mule kicking me in the chest. SUPER STRONG and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

You can't go wrong with the omelettes and various other breakfast fare. I recommend the Greek Omelette. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. They are busy on Friday nights! 

Prices were good and the portions are large. I had the Philly Steak & Cheese. 

The food arrived fast and the service was great. There was a man who was walking around checking on all the tables. I'm thinking he may have been the owner. 

All the food was served very hot, which is great. A very good experience! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best dinner in the West Valley.  Great food, prices, staff, and management.  Our favorite place for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I love their spanakopita! Delish!!! We've had as many as 15 in our party with good service and great food."}
{"text":"Nicks Diner II has a great selection of entries & daily specials for a great price. Seating area's were comfortable and clean. I had the Lasagna. It comes with soup or salad and 3 slices of dinner bread with a  melted butter dip, sprinkled with parmesan & garlic. A great meal under $10 .I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Wonderful service, & the food was Delicious and hot. I really hope they widened their dessert selections on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food, large portions.

Don't make the mistake of going to Nick's on Reems Rd.
The food & service are much better at Nick's II at Waddell & Litchfield. 

Different owners."}
{"text":"My hubby and I love this place. Really good food. Fast and friendly service. Way better choice than the chain diners."}
{"text":"First - I just won't write a Yelp review for a dining establishment if I haven't eaten there at least about four or five times.  That's the first question that I ask myself when I read a scathing review on a place where my experience has been so good.  Asking about a restaurant of people is like asking about hospitals - you can always find someone who will tell you place will kill you.....   My experience at Nick's having eaten there about once a month over the past couple of years is outstanding.  I've never ordered a bad meal and portion sizes only offend my heart doctor!   But go at weird hours or plan to wait - simple as that - because apparently they have a large base of very satisfied customers."}
{"text":"We chose to come here based off the reviews, which was a gamble, with many many GREAT reviews and a handful of horrible. We walked in on a Saturday late morning to a packed dining room! We were greeted friendly and promptly, and only had to wait about 15 minutes. 

After we were seated it took a few minutes to get greeted. I just recently quit my job as a server manager at another restaurant so I understand completely how much work the wait staff has. When she did make it to our table she was not overly friendly, which was fine. We were here to visit with each other anyway. 
 
We got our drinks promptly after they were ordered and she took our food order quickly also. I ordered the corn beef hash, which I was slightly nervous about because no one can make corn beef hash like momma can, but alas I went with it. Their version of \"hashbrowns\" are a little different but I really enjoyed them. And I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the dish! It was second only to my moms. I would order it again. About 3/4 of the wau through my meal, however, I found about a 3\" long black hair that came free of charge. But I'm not one to complain, I had eaten it up until that point so oh well. 

All in all my meal was good, the service could have been friendlier, and I definitely could have done without hair in my food. I don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in The west valley!!! Delicious Generous portions for very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We go to Nick's 2 for breakfast frequently, but had not done dinner.  I had the pork tenderloin (even though I had seen reviews it was not good)dinner and it was wonderful. It came with soup or salad, and I opted for the salad which was very nice.  There was also a bread basket.  Great bread. We had also ordered onion rings.  The onion rings were delicious, very crispy and plentiful. The dinner was also good. My husband opted for the gyro and was very pleased. And as aways the staff was friendly and efficient. We will be going there again."}
{"text":"Took my son here for breakfast today.  Great service and great food.  My son loves their Begium waffle and he a picky Eater."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Very clean- and busy! It was packed with loyal fans. Good value and food arrived at the table quickly, even though they were packed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good except they may need a little more training for the new people. Other than that the food is pretty good and big portions!"}
{"text":"I have been here a twice and have nothing but great service!! Food is hot, fresh, and tasty!! Always packed but the wait has never been long for table of 2 or 3 people."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, friendly staff and the Chicken Salad Sandwich is off the hook and always available! We drive out of our way, past another Nick's to come to this Nick's just for the tasty, chunky, fresh chicken salad. They really know how to keep those ice teas coming, too!"}
{"text":"They've moved from old location to the center where the Surprise Theater is located, just around the street. Bigger place, nicer location. Always order their handmade mushroom & Swiss cheese burger with salad to carry out! The burger is always fresh, never frozen and cooked the way you like it however, the mushrooms on top are always from a can! That is why I gave it four stars! The salad is made with field greens which is new and better than before and has grape tomatoes also better choice than before.  I enjoy their homemade dressing that has oregano in it.  I would not call it an Italian Restaurant.  The owner is Greek and serves some Greek dishes!  Their fried fish is heavily breaded as well as their zuchinni appetizer.  Need to change the address and mention, Greek food!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We come pretty regularly for a delicious breakfast when we are kid free for the day (Nick's is very kid friendly, our kids just aren't \"restaurant friendly\" lol). It's definitely become our go to breakfast spot!! 

He loves the bacon and home fries, while I'm a big fan of the Eggs Benedict! The EB is huge as it comes with home fries on the side (and all for $8)!! Their biscuits and gravy are pretty killer when you're in the mood for a splurge too! The breakfast prices are really reasonable, and the food is always good. I especially appreciate that they always have vanilla and hazelnut coffee creamers on the table with the half & half, since that's my favorite way to drink my coffee!

I would give 5 stars for just the breakfast. My only hesitation and 4 star rating is that the lunch/dinner we've had here had just been \"ok.\" The husband enjoys their Philly Cheesesteak, but I've been disappointed with their grilled salmon and fish. Both were overcooked and dried out. But everything has had good flavor, so it could have been a fluke since we've only been once for lunch and once for dinner.

It's nice that they have a reward/punch card. However, it's not as good as a lot of places that offer them. You get one punch per visit (minimum $5 purchase), not per meal. So when I came with my parents, husband and kids and spent over $60, it was the same single punch as breakfast with my husband this morning for $15. After 6 visits (with punch), you receive one meal for free, that they limit to a $6 value. So while the program leaves a lot to be desired, I at least appreciate the effort to have a loyalty card/program at all!! 

Overall, awesome breakfast joint with great prices and service!!"}
{"text":"Don't confuse this Nick's Diner with the one on Reems road.  The food here is so much better.  Large selection of foods and have no fear of getting enough to eat.  The owner Nick greeted us at the door with a friendly welcome and the entire waiting staff were helpful and very friendly.  Very clean and even though crowded the food came out to us fairly quickly.  We were impressed and enjoyed our meal.  We will certainly return.  This place is also close to our one and only movie theater here in Surprise.  Another added bonus."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had breakfast here his morning. Staff was warm and friendly! Food was really good and fresh. I had scrambled eggs with potatoes and asked if I could switch the toast that came with it for fruit and they were very accommodating. The strawberries that they gave me were delicious! My daughter had pancakes with bacon and said the pancakes were really good, like the ones I make at home! They were not too thin and not too dense. We loved this place and were very happy we didn't go to ihop! I wish I cold try some of their lunch items. The menu looked great! I would highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Nick's is a happening place! It has. Wide variety of options, which is great if you have a group of picky and/or indecisive people. The staff is friendly; the food is delicious, and you always leave feeling full and satisfied."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and have always found the food to be good with generous portions and friendly service.  However, a couple weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon at about 4:00 pm, a friend and I went there for an early dinner when it wasn't busy.  Our waitress was surly at best.  I ordered the soup and 1/2 turkey and swiss sandwich.  The soup was fine but when I bit into the sandwich, I found it incredibly dry.  There was nothing on the bread at all and they forgot the swiss cheese.  When I called this to the attention to another waitress, she too was rude, taking the plate from me without apology or anything.  When our waitress brought my sandwich back, she said \"they would give me the swiss cheese this time but the sandwich doesn't come with swiss\".  REALLY??????????   A turkey and swiss sandwich doesn't come with swiss????????  (With this logic, I wonder what would happen if, say, I ordered bacon and eggs or peanut butter and jelly)  I told her it states on the menu Turkey AND swiss.  She shrugged and said, \"that's what they told me\"."}
{"text":"First of all:  DO NOT GO TO THE ORIGINAL NICK'S ON REEMS, IT IS NOT THE SAME OWNER.  I guess Nick used to own the Nick's on Reems, but he is now no longer affiliated with that restaurant.  

Nick's II is a great restaurant, and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to Nick's II for breakfast this morning on a lark. I will definitely be back...the Greek favorite omelet was incredible and every time I turned around, my coffee cup was full. Pricing was fair and the portion was huge.

Looking forward to seeing the lunch/dinner menu next time"}
{"text":"In my opinion Nick's diner II is the best breakfast place in the whole Surprise area.  I've tried many others and Nick's always comes out on top.  The server's are friendly, the food comes out super quick (and always hot).  Always consistently great food.  It is definitely my \"go to\" diner!"}
{"text":"Their food is delicious, cheap and portions are huge. Great variety and anyone can find something on the menu that they'd like. 
Customer service could have been a little better (faster, more smiles) but Nick's is still worth visiting"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and price. I have been to Nick's diner 1 which is closer to where I live but will drive extra to go to Nick's diner 2. Diner 2 is the one that I like best."}
{"text":"The fish fry on Friday is excellent. A bit much for me so I just order the dinner and still take home leftovers. It could be a little more seasoned but it was not greasy and it was cooked perfect. I have had their salads, greek chicken soup, chicken gyro, and breakfast and everything was tasty. The service is excellent and the owner even comes out and talks to the customers. Great family business that I will go back to again and again."}
{"text":"The food is great.  The staff is awesome. The prices are real (not dirt cheap, because it's not cheap food) and well worth the product. Location is right in the middle of a developing community. The only reason I don't give this place a 5 star is because of the size of the joint. Kinda small, but the wait was fair so overall Nicks is the place to go if you are wondering what IHOP and Denny's should be benchmarking."}
{"text":"Amazing service! It was a struggle to find a good breakfast place in surprise area but Nicks diner was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Thought we would stop somewhere for breakfast and remembered seeing Nick's Diner ll. Service was awesome.....eggs, sausage,ham,bacon and french toast was awesome. This is definitely are new breakfast place! Now we'll have to try it for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"I had the best lobster ravioli I have ever had. The service is super friendly and nice. I would recommend going to their establishment."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and tried it out this morning for brunch.  I had the Meat and Cheese Lover's Omelette and my wife had the BLT.  Both were outstanding and the service was super.  They just recently moved into this new location and the interior was very nice.  The restaurant was full but unlike a lot of these types of places the service was still first rate despite the crowd.  We will definitely return here and would highly recommend it for breakfast or lunch.  They have some really good deals for breakfast during the week which we intend to try soon."}
{"text":"From the outside looking in, Nick's Diner had always seemed to be the hot spot when it came to breakfast in Surprise, as it was often that I would hear people mention the place. Yes, whether it was at work or at the grocery store, when the topic was food people frequently mentioned Nick's and eventually I became intrigued. Now I am not much for crowds and rumor was that it sometimes got a bit chaotic there (must be good, ?) so I put off the visit up until recently.

 Now, before I begin let me just say, being sort of a local here there is one thing I have learned about the dining industry in the city of Surprise...there are way too many people and not enough decent establishments that offer a quality dining experience. For this reason alone I often find myself heading east into Phoenix whenever we want to go to a restaurant. So when it comes to Nick's, ladies and gentlemen, I truly believe the people of Surprise have merely settled. After my visit this week to the \"esteemed\" diner, I grant it TWO STARS. Why?

 My first visit occurred on a weekday. I had the day off work so decided to take myself and my wife to breakfast. Originally she wanted to go to IHOP, as it is sadly the only place to get crepes around here (she loves them), but upon arrival we noticed the massive line (damn snowbirds). After a quick deliberation we decided, \"HEY! Let's try that place Nick's!\", and so that's where we went. 

 First impressions? Roomy place and was so thrilled to see that, despite having a decent crowd, they didn't turn the tables into a crowded mess. The decor was plain, and there was a strange scent to the place, but with a quick glance it was safe to assume that it was coming from the customers (damn snowbirds). Service side was fine, no issues, but no personality, pretty cut and dry. Ultimately the only knock I had on the service was probably more on the procedural side of things. You see, when the servers brought you your food, they would transfer any dishes or trash that accumulated over the course of the appetizers onto a serving tray they placed next to your table. They would then move on, leaving that tray of waste for a busser to come scoop up. That's fine and everything, except when you are eating, the last thing you want to look at is a tray of discarded waste sitting a foot away from your table. It wasn't just that one instance either, it was a common theme between employees all over the restaurant. 

 Now to the food! I figured since this place was known for it's Greek cuisine and breakfast, I'd try a Greek breakfast, so I went with \"Nick's Greek Skillet\". For a dish with such a prestigious title, it was surprisingly bland. The skillet portion was above average, came with a pancake on the side and rather than on a skillet was served in a glass dish. Like I said above, VERY BLAND. I mean, the eggs tasted like eggs and the potatoes tasted like potatoes but there was absolutely no seasoning, no individuality, and quite honestly, nothing even remotely unique about the dish. Because it was heavily drenched in grease, after a few bites you were already stuffed. The bacon (or at least, what I hope was bacon?) was so extraordinarily dry and burnt, it was as if they sliced it right off the hide of one of their snowbird customers. Nothing about my dish (except maybe the mystery \"gyro meat\") was Greek, and nothing was appetizing. I've tasted better skillets straight out of the frozen section of Walmart. The pancake they gave me seemed to be as defeated as the skillet, it was as if their recipe consisted of water and Bisquick. My wife went with a chicken pita with fries and it was just as bland as mine was, and both the fries and chicken tasted like they had been frozen. Our third wheel we brought chose the lasagna and it was blatantly obvious that it had been heated in the microwave. The center was piping hot and the pasta was almost like rubber. The mess they put under the rubbery pasta was essentially a marinara soup and was not even remotely appetizing. She took two bites and shoved it aside. Hey Nick, pal....if customers wanted frozen lasagna, they would just go buy a Stouffer's at half the price.

 All in all, everything about our experience was bland. I would love to take a candid tour of that kitchen, because I know for a fact that most products are frozen and that a microwave is used often. Those are things you just cant mask, and quite honestly, makes you feel a bit ripped off when you get that $30+ bill. As I implied previously, I strongly believe the reason for Nick's Diner's popularity is due to the fact that there isn't enough competition. There clearly is a lack of passion here and not one part of our meals seemed like authentic Greek. Maybe the place was decent once, but those times are long gone. Ultimately, it was cafeteria food you'd find in a hospital. Don't buy into the hype, unless you like someone serving you a reheated bland mess, avoid it until Nick rediscovers that passion he lost."}
{"text":"Love Nick's. Food is great, portions are large and very filling. Service staff always friendly."}
{"text":"Been her one time and was very happy with the food and the service. Was upset that Taste of New York shut down but at least this place is a good alternative!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I should have tried this place years ago. Very friendly staff. Lasagna and fish and chips were terrific. Military discount. Located next to the movie theater."}
{"text":"Been looking for a place that cooks like my Nana did, this is not bad but still lookin for my favorite breakfast restaurant though. I'll keep coming back for sure good prices good portions fare service, can't complain  It says Italian but their Greek"}
{"text":"Ok food, friendly servers.  Went two weeks ago with my sister.  The owner seemed to be yelling quite a bit.  The kitchen staff was yelling as well.  Not an atmosphere I want to return to."}
{"text":"It was busy when we went for breakfast but we were seated pretty quickly. Everything came out fast and was reasonably priced. The portions were big and it was about $40 for a family of four. My only complaint is it was hot and a little stuffy inside. Really clean though and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"First time here:
J.d.
10:20 a.m. I ordered #3 2egg, 3 sausages, 2 potato cakes, whole wheat bread, not toast and coffee.
Service;
Server,Sara, was apparently training a new server.This did not detract her from the qualities we expect  in this atmosphere.
Food/Quality:
AWESOME!
Cleanliness; above average.
Will I/We return?
OH YEAH! Yes.Definitley!

{"text":"Nicks Dinner ll my family and I frequently enjoy a meal here. The portion and price is very fair. The food consistently comes to us fresh and hot. The flavor is well above average and heavily enjoyed to the last bite. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Hit & miss. Half our food was great, half was burnt! Some had no flavor. Coffee was room temp & Service was a bit slow. I lowered it from 3 stars to 2 because the waitress had an argument with three elderly ladies about extra fries! Not a way to get customers to come back!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant a few times.  We liked the fact that it is a locally owned restaurant, and the food is pretty decent.
After what happened tonight, I would rather throw my money in the trash than give it to the owners of this restaurant.
I took my children to an early dinner.  When we arrived, there were two other couples in the place, and they both already had their dinners.  We ordered dinner - a french toast meal, a bacon hamburger with soup (instead of fries), and Eggs Benedict with no muffins and eggs over-hard.  
When the meals came...the french toast was the only thing right.  The hamburger came with fries, no soup.  Easily fixed.  My meal came with eggs runny as anything.  I sent them back.
When the waitress told the \"chef\" that I had asked for my eggs over-hard, he complained loud enough that I heard it.  It wasn't his fault - she had forgotten to tell him.  He grudgingly made me a new meal, and sent it out.
My eggs were still runny.  I sent them back again.  The complaint (in Greek) that came from the kitchen was loud enough to cause the other patrons of the restaurant to take notice.
My eggs came back out again (by this time, my kids were almost done eating), and they had clearly been microwaved and were rubbery.
As I was eating my meal (no eggs....I didn't trust them, or the chef), the owner of the restaurant went into the kitchen.  The chef very loudly had a conversation with the owner, I'm assuming about me, as the owner then stared at me until I noticed him.
As I was getting ready to pay for the meal (which had no compensation at all for my wait time or the crappy service), I told the waitress that I would be filing a formal review on Yelp and any other site I could find.  
Dear Owner of Nicks - have some freaking professionalism.  Your attitude towards a \"difficult\" customer is going to come back to you tenfold.  I will be telling every person I know in the Surprise area that your restaurant is unprofessional, doesn't care to help it's customers, and isn't worth their money.
I will not ever step foot into this place again."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. My husband had Dolmades which were okay. My son enjoyed his omelette until he found a hair in it, then he was finished eating. Breakfast potatoes were not spiced at all, but were okay once a little salt and pepper was added"}
{"text":"absolutely the most magnificent chicken fried steak! booom babyhit the spot!!!! the staff was fast and polite! it's my new meeting place!"}
{"text":"Great service, big portions, and it's yummy!!! The owner walks around and makes sure you are well served. Jokes and hi fives the kiddos. You must get the onion rings and bring you appetite. Kids eat free on Monday and their portions can feed an adult. If you are on a diet, avoid this place. Too much good food."}
{"text":"If your looking for an old fashion greasy spoon, you have it here. Large portions (too large), medium distractions, economical and very fast service. Great place for children."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time about a month ago, and have been back 4 times since. They have great prices and great servers. About the food-it's really good. The breakfasts are big portioned. My simple American breakfast was cooked perfectly. We've been for dinner, and I've had the steak kebobs, my husband had the fish fry, and I've had the chicken gyro. All really good. My husband said their fish is one of the best he's had, the batter they use is perfect and it's not greasy. Yes, their salads are just romaine lettuce with tomato and olives, but since it's just a side salad, I thought it was fine, I noticed if you order a salad as a meal, they include much more vegetables. The thing that most impressed me was the presentation of the food (maybe I watch too much Gordon Ramsay). It's dove really nicely for a diner, not your typical leaf of kale. Overall, I know we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is amazing. The first thing you notice when you walk in is all the staff are happy. Not one person looked like they didn't want to be there. I ordered a gyro with a salad. The salad came out in about five minutes. Within ten minutes the gyro arrived. It was huge! The meat is thick, the taziki ( or however you spell it )sauce was awesome, and the pita is perfect. I will be back."}
{"text":"Me and my husband's favorite place to go every Saturday morning for breakfast. There's never a long wait,  food is great and we're always greeted with a smile from all the ladies there at Nicks. All this for a generous portion at a great price! You should give them a try. It will be your favorite too."}
{"text":"My family likes coming here for breakfast. There are plenty of choices and food always comes out hot and fast. Nick, the owner, often comes around and says hello. That is a nice touch.

Today, we were a little disappointed in how long it took our server to bring us our bill. Seemed a little disorganized today."}
{"text":"My new fav restaurant. Quality fresh ingredients. Homemade tasting food. HUGE portions at a very good price! Servers are exceptional. I highly recommend you to give them a try. They even have a loyalty card they stamp at every visit. Free pie/rice pudding/bread pudding during week at dinner."}
{"text":"SOOOO good! biscuits and gravy are awesome, meat lovers skillet is delicious, (crunchy veggies amazing) love it here"}
{"text":"An excellent choice for breakfast! We were there on a Saturday morning....good sign....the place was full....We were promptly seated and given time to cruise the menu since we had not been here before.. Being very busy, we anticipated having a bit of a wait for our food...nope.....breakfast arrived very quickly...almost like we were the only people there. Portions were quite ample, and the quality was very good. Our waitress was excellent. Prices are very affordable. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had a bit of time to kill before meeting my next client and had a craving for a delicious breakfast burrito. Yelp didn't disappoint, offering me several nearby breakfast joints. Upon entry, Nick's Diner II was clean and inviting. It was larger than I expected and I noticed each staff member diligently at work. I was greeted promptly, given 2 seat options and landed at the counter looking into the kitchen. I browsed the menu looking for any sign of \"burrito\" and before I could finish my server warmly asked if I knew what I'd like to have. I explained to her what I was after and she said, \"I have just the thing for you.\" Moments later she returned with a monster burrito, toasted on each side and cut in half. As she sat the food down in front of me, I swear a choir sang out  ENJOY . Long story short the burrito was amazing, filled with meat, cheese, veggies, and potatoes. (I would have liked to see the spuds a bit more crispy with more seasoning) all in all, I'd come back here and order my filling well done"}
{"text":"Great food but everytime I have gone there my debit information was compromised by their system or an employee! My bank had to cancel my card because I had out of state charges that weren't mine. I noticed the pattern when the third time it was the only place I used my card and by the next day I had charges in NYC from a cab company and urban outfitters. The times before this card were from California. Both places I haven't been in for years. I called the diner to let the owner know of the problem. At first he wasn't there I was told to call back in a half hour. When I called back the waitress pretended she couldn't hear me and kept hanging up on me. Then I had someone call for me who then handed the phone to me with Nick on the line. He actually admitted they have been having a problem and had his machines checked with no problems. I told him maybe one of his employees might be the problem. He wants me to bring in my receipts so his bank can check things out. I really like this place but if I go again I'm bringing cash!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met family here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. First time and it was nice. The restaurant is nice and the bathrooms are clean. The board with specials is fun and decorative. The food portions are huge at a great price. You want to get there early or you will be waiting in line. I had the #15 French Toast stuffed with cream cheese and strawberries with bacon and it was yummy. My husband had the western omelet and I can tell you it tasted great as well. Nice place and hope to visit again."}
{"text":"My breakfast was perfect with the potato cakes, and I've never had better, more professional service. I hope to come back next year during Spring Training. GO ROYALS"}
{"text":"Food was very good. The service was excellent. Hostess was very friendly, and server was great. The price was spot on for the portion size. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Had an unpleasant experience with service as well as food. My sons pancake was raw , my husband had to get up twice to get his own coffee and the waitress's excuse was that their food was cheap. I guess in her mind that justifies our experience . When we communicated our concerns she asked us to pick up our kids and leave. In an age where customer service is so important I would rather pay an extra dollar in order to be able to enjoy a good meal with my family.."}
{"text":"I grew up in wisconsin and Greek diners were always my favorite, so to find nicks was like a little taste of home! Huge portions of great food! Make sure you try the clam chowder on Fridays! Looking forward to bring family for amazing meals!!!"}
{"text":"Same good food as original Nick's Diner without the permeating bathroom smell."}
{"text":"My family loves to go here for breakfast. They give big portions. Everything we've tried has been great! They have huge cinnamon rolls on Sundays."}
{"text":"Good food for a fair price. Typical breakfast place w/nothing too fancy. Good value on special's & kid's meals. We were sad to find out the giant cinnamon rolls are only served on Sunday's."}
{"text":"Great diner! We stopped in for a late breakfast, got coffee, country fried steak, Greek skillet, and both came with choice of toast, pancakes or French toast. (Of course we chose the French toast!) 
Service was prompt, friendly, and happy. Coffee creamer flavor choices along with half and half on the table along with a massive jug of syrup. Coffe was fresh, Country fried steak was easily the best I've EVER eaten. Greek skillet didn't skimp on the beef or feta. Eggs were cooked to perfection. 
We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I was hankering for a good chicken fried steak and saw that Nick's had it on their menu. After hearing all the rave reviews, we decided to give it a try. First, the pros. The portions were very generous-- so much so, we couldn't finish the meal. 
My wife had the stir fry, I had the chicken fried steak and the kids had the Reuben sandwiches. 
Kids didn't care for the sandwiches because the rye bread was very pungent-- they're kids so don't read a lot into their dislike. I also didn't like the Reubens; same as my kids, I didn't like how pungent the rye was. I prefer a marble rye. My wife had the stir fry and thought there was too much sauce making the dish mushy. The chicken-fried steak was bland and the breading needed some help with seasoning. 
The worst part of our experience was the service. After forgetting part of our order-- leaving in the pass through window (we could see it sitting there)-- our server stopped by once to check on our table and didn't find her way back until we flagged another server down to go and get her."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait... After we ordered the food came within 15 minutes. Our waitress Red was AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"**UPDATE 
Someone named David contacted me who I think must work there bc he said the exact same thing the waitress said to us word-for-word about the corned beef hash. They serve slices of corned beef instead of hash. He (they) said \"Maybe you're used to the way it comes in a can\". For one thing, that's kind of condescending. For another,  IT'S WRONG!

\"Hash is a dish consisting of diced or chopped meat, potatoes and spices that are mixed together and then cooked either alone or with other ingredients such as onions. The name is derived from the French verb hacher (to chop).\"

Makes sense, I mean have you ever ordered hashed browns and received sliced potatoes? 

Maybe you should dispense with the \"canned\" answer (which shows you have to say it often!), and rename the sliced corned beef dish you are selling? 

We have ordered this favorite dish in a lot of different restaurants all over the country, and not one has served in big thick slices. It's a real let down when you have your tastes set for hash and get that. 

If you din't want to change the name, please consider putting a picture of the dish in the menu. It could avoid some food waste for you and frustration for the customer."}
{"text":"This is our first visit here. We had a party of 9 on a super busy evening. The owner was more than happy to accommodate us and our waitress did a fantastic job with a large group. I had one of the specials, dolmades and gyro. They were wonderful! Large portions and I took some home for lunch tomorrow! Our family really enjoyed the variety of choices as we had children and adults with all different tastes in food. We were pleasantly surprised and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place was a bit difficult to spot at first. Once I \"discovered\" this location, I have been back a second time and is on my list of places to return to again and again. They have a great selection of Italian, Greek and American food and the servings are huge! The food is excellent and the servers are friendly. The owner made it a point to stroll around at least once each time I was there and was very friendly as well and took the time to actually listen to what the customers said. Like I said, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch & got the lamb shank. Was delicious, veggies were nice and crisp and the rice was very tasty. Only thing was the salad was just ok. Overall though id recommend this place if you're in the mood for good home style cooking."}
{"text":"Eat at Nick's every Saturday morning for breakfast. Excellent service and good quality food."}
{"text":"Went in with my parents when I was visiting them recently.  We were in search of Fish & Chips. They have a Friday Fish special I had been told so went to check it out.  It did not disappoint. The fish was very clean tasting. The batter was not too heavy or burnt as it can be sometimes when ordering fried fish. Only let down was the fries as there really wasn't any flavor to them whatsoever. They just tasted like a starchy blob. They needed some seasoning of some sort. I will go back but order something others than fries with the meal if possible."}
{"text":"Clean interior, Friendly Staff.

I ordered a breakfast sandwich and that brught with it a side of home fries.  It was all decent. I did expect more from both, the Denver Sandwich I expected to be more like a fried egg, sauteed veggies and melted cheese holding it all together, but it was all the ingredients cooked into an omlete patty.  The homefries seemed lacking creativity as well.  It may just be me, but when I think of dinner I think it should be more original and have a better flavor than Denny's or IHoP.  None of it was bad, but I expected different.

I must say the potatoe pancakes my friend ordered were very tasty. When you order a side of oatmeal, They serve you a healthy portion, which I think is a major plus.

I may just have to experience their greek food and update my review."}
{"text":"Good Greek food, gyro is stuffed with nicely seasoned meat. Hummus tastes fresh has olive oil and kalamata olives with hot pita bread. Yummy huge onion rings, Thick steak fries. Breakfast looks good too, but I'll have to come back and try that!"}
{"text":"The expierence is amazing as well as the food great tasty meals my mom and I go at least 3 times a week and we come weekly the servers friendly and personable everybody even the customers they are nice I see a lot of the same customers today someone bought my breakfast and my moms the server told me and we where shocked and to say the least HaPpy my mom has Cancer and I take her out to eat here more now because she eats everything she is having chemo soon that act of kindness shows a place like this has loyal and good kind hearted customers besides the food and service being EXCELLENT its feels like a small town mentality good home cooked food with servers and customers both NICE !!!! Worth every bite !!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out through the surprise delivery Express and I was very very very please when our first experience with Nick's Diner 2. We ordered a gyro sandwich with onion rings and ranch. There was a slight upcharge for the onion rings but that's okay because they were delicious! The amount of gyro meat on the Pita was amazing! And that's a tziaki  sauce was on point! We also ordered the fettuccine alfredo. It was a very nice sized portion with a large amount of alfredo sauce. Both meals tasted like heaven. The ranch that I got with my onion rings is amazing also! You can tell it's homemade and not from a bottle."}
{"text":"My husband loves this restaurant, home cooked food and grest service for a reasonable price"}
{"text":"Perfect place for breakfast on a Sun. We go at least once a month. Someday I'm going to try their Sunday only cinnamon bun. It's huge & will probably raise my sugar levels higher & higher than they should be. Wonderful place for breakfast & not bad for lunch."}
{"text":"We came to try this new location and was pleased by the bigger size and openness of the dining room, the service was fast and the food was good, but we were not pleased about being charged $2 extra for two slices of tomato and a few lettuce leaves or the condecending attitude of our waitress."}
{"text":"The wait is worth it on Sunday mornings. The food is great! Prices are awesome. Family atmosphere. Kid friendly. I have to say since we have been living here people haven't been so friendly but we were given a dose of hope on our Sunday morning breakfast outing. We (my husband, our little girl and myself) went November 1st 2015 at 10 am in the morning needing a very bad pick me up after my grandmother getting a really bad diagnosis which just was the tip of the iceberg of our bad week. Needless to say we really needed a dose of hope in humanity and it seems someone answered the call and picked up our tab. It was amazing what they did for our family. It might have been a simple meal to anyone else but for us it was hope. Thanks a million times over for whom ever did this for us. Bless you a million times over."}
{"text":"Nice staff, large portions and good tasting.  They only problem was that a person in our party couldn't eat the meatloaf b/c it had a much too different seasoning in it.  There was no difficulty in getting it taken of the check.  And, now that I remember, the service was a bit slow, but it was fairly crowded that time."}
{"text":"I havent been to Nicks Diner II since they moved to this new location. Nicks always has a solid food selection and the food is usualy on point taste wise. Pricing is very reasonable for the amount of food that is given to you. Be prepaired to wait to be seated on weekends though, Nicks can get packed. Our server Robin was great making sure I had fresh coffee and making sure we were ok without being to intrusive. The menu has a variety of diffrent options consisting of american and greek cuisine. There is usualy something for everyone. The two prior locations that Nicks diner was at were very small and the wairing area usually spilled outside. Not a big deal unless its Summer time. Nicks really made an effort to make a bigger waiting area to accommodate the amount of hungry customers waiting to get in. I really like ciming out to Nicks for breakfast and look forward to returning. 

P.S. I have yet to try it but they have a HUGE cinnamon bun that is only avaliabe on Sundays. I got to try it!"}
{"text":"1st time here. The service is friendly and the food has good portions and is tasty. We ordered one of the specials a Spanikopita /Gyro plate w a lemon chicken rice soup. The soup is very tasty and the rice and tzaziki w the Gyro was good. The Spanikopita was homemade but would've loved if it were made w a more flavorful feta. We also got the shrimp salad which had a good amount of shrimp and tasted good. All around very nice atmosphere and clean. Very nice diner we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Food and nice size portions at a decent price. Can't wait till I get a chance to  go back for more. Good breakfast, lunch & or dinner.
My personal favorite, their Gyros"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time. We both had the philly cheese steak. The wife had fries and I had salad. Soup was an option as well. Everything was good and we will be back. We will try breakfast next time. Breakfast is served all day."}
{"text":"We used to eat at the original Nicks and when we returned this year for a couple months we heard there was another location!  My first meal was dinner and had the nightly special, Chicken Kabobs & Gyros.  Wow...how does he get that chicken so tender? Long marinade time, I hear.  Nick is always there and greets you most times. Had breakfast there last week and had the oatmeal and a side of bacon. OMG...the bacon is thin and crispy and the oatmeal was luscious and creamy.  
Both meals are also a bargain for what you get.  I didn't enjoy the wine, but that isn't their deal...I can live with that.  I am out of town right now and am craving dinner and wish I was there to dive into a meal. Oh well!"}
{"text":"The host was quick to greet us, took us to a table, but had to finish bussing it off and wipe it. After sitting for about 10 minutes our server came over to us and took our drink order & food. About 18 minutes later two stuffed french toasts with eggs over easy came out. Overall the taste was really bland. -This was a Wednesday at 1:30 pm. It was $30+ for two people for an ALRIGHT experience and mediocre hospital food."}
{"text":"Looks clean & crowded with the fish fry. Family owned diner.  Cod is fried served with fries and choice of soup, salad or Cole slaw. We will come back again to try breakfast too"}
{"text":"Really good food, great people, and great prices! My son said their fettuccini Alfredo is better here than Cheesecake Factory's !"}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been here many, many times and will continue to go. The food is always great, I personally enjoy the traditional eggs, bacon, hash browns and I usually substitute a pancake for the toast. I  highly recommend this local spot if you are looking to get some great food."}
{"text":"Wait Staff nice and ready to bring your refills. Breakfast are wonderful and filling at a great value and price.  Lunch in the past hamburger meat was over cooked to being dry and hard, but other dish's were great.  Greek menu items along with other American favorites.  My favorite is the gyro.  I do need to say that during the months of November through February, staff is over worked, and they do there best to keep up with the demanding older customers that don't always tip as they should."}
{"text":"Cute little place that tries to be a small-town diner in a big cuty strip mall.  Seating is limited.  The kids portions are huge and my kids loved their food.  Mine was blah (I had the veggie omelet).  My older daughter ordered the eggs benedict and I tried a bite - terrible.  The eggs were overcooked and the center solid.  The big slab of ham was gross.  The sauce tasted like it was made from powder mix.  My husband had the waffle and he left half of it on the place - said it tasted bland.  On the upside, the waitress was very friendly and tried hard to make up for the shortcomings of the food.  Overall, not a terrible place but if it's this kind of bland processed food you want, try Village Inn, same stuff for cheaper."}
{"text":"only eaten here a couple of times, but both times the service was great, and the portions were large, and the prices were reasonable. I love the bread they serve with all the meals."}
{"text":"Well let me say our experience started out bad. The hostess was rude when my son walked up and asked for a table of 4. When we sat down the table was still wet which isn't ideal but we dried it with our napkins. The waitress seemed to be upset but she took care of our order. My son order the philly cheese steak and my boyfriend, my niece and I all had a burger. Beside the service not being good the next problem was that we found 4 pieces of hair in my nieces food. It was curly hair that looked like a beard hair. After that we couldn't eat our food I had taken about 3 bites and after seeing all that hair we just couldn't eat it.the manager did say we didn't have to pay for our food. We unfortunately will never come to this place because it made us sick to our stomachs 
The flavor was there but after that experience it is hard to come back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and i lived in NJ my whole life so i know diner food and this is as close as they come. Big selection on the menu and food always tastes good."}
{"text":"Horrible food.  So clueless on what people think is good food, pizza here is nasty and they all suck. Original or not. Those that enjoy mediocracy get dominos or Denny's. Geesh."}
{"text":"The food was mostly good, the burger was lacking flavor so I recommend one if the Greek specialties. They would probably get 4 stars however the service was terrible!! We waited 10 minutes just to have someone bring us drinks, then said she had to put in an order and would be right back to take ours. 10 minutes later out order was taken, we got our food in reasonable amount of time. Then not once did someone come by to see how it was, if we needed anything....we even had to ask another server for our check and left cash on the table as we didn't know how long it would of taken to pay with a card, like we would of like to. Anyway over all good kitchen staff, bad bad wait staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite diner in Phoenix. It's very intimate and the food is pretty good. I'll be back for sure, they have a pretty good mix of breakfast and lunch at all times."}
{"text":"So last night-I went to Nicks 2 with some friends. I hate going out to eat because most food hates me and it's all so greasy BUT... This place rocks. I had the spinach and cheese omelet with added mushrooms. OMG. IT WAS AWESOME. Not floating in a plate of grease or too much butter. You could actually taste the ingredients. Everything from the bread, lemon chicken soup, yummy French toast was amazing ....so even finicky eaters can come here and rest easy. The food won't bite you back! Lol. This is a wonderful atmosphere too. Come as you are ...be comfortable, enjoy. Tv's discreetly placed in the corners in the back ( not overbearing) Servers are great and happy to help you. I always know cause I'm \"high maintenance\" when it comes to changing menu items. They rolled right with me. The menu is varied...a little bit for everybody... So....make your way to Nicks ll ( that's right NICKS #2 and don't get it mixed up with the other one!!) and have a great meal!! Nick always comes out and greats everybody seated during the night. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My family and I love to come here for breakfast. Their food tastes great and the prices are fantastic! We had tried a new breakfast spot that was okay and expensive. We ended coming back to Nick's Diner. The owner makes his rounds to each table to make sure everything is great. The staff is wonderful too."}
{"text":"02/03/17 IMPORTANT NOTE: 
Nick's Diner II WAS on Litchfield Rd but is now at 13765 W Waddell Rd, Surprise, AZ 85379

Had lunch here with my Mom and my BF today. AS ALWAYS, the service was great and the food was great!!!! Mom ordered the Liver & Onions - a generous portion that filled her belly there and left enough to bring home. I had the Meat Lover's Skillet. As I am Gluten Free, the waitress had a little extra home fries added instead of giving me the toast that usually accompanies this dish. My BF had the Gyro \"Special\" on the board with a salad - which was mixed greens NOT iceberg, cherry tomatoes and olives with the Greek dressing. 

Everyone left full and happy. Also ALWAYS a pleasure to get a visit from the proprietor, Nick, himself. We first met Nick about 10 years ago when he opened the first \"Nick's Diner\" on Reems but we followed him to Nick's Diner II."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for a late breakfast a few weeks ago. Found out they are opening a second location. Went to the Nick's Diner 2 location.  OK so what happened to flavor? Bland..(all 3 entrees) server was totally clueless. Flavorless, clueless service and thats the whole story."}
{"text":"Always love the food and usually the service but today's waitress was not friendly and not very attentive.  Again both are usually great."}
{"text":"Great service, a little by of a wait but this only means well since the food was amazing. Ordered the chicken fried steak and the gravy was delicious with chunks of sausage in it. The home fries were a little under cooked but the eggs are yummy. Great environment and the owner greets guests, serves beer and great selection from American to Greek foods, great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Hungry? Nicks Diner 2 has HUGE portions and quick service! There is a bit of a wait to get in, especially on the weekend, but once you're seated, it's fast and delicious!"}
{"text":"Nick is watching but it took our server quite a while to stop by our table. She seems to get lost somewhere."}
{"text":"We love Nicks! We've eaten here several times for breakfast and lunch and every time the food and service was superb! They offer large portions at reasonable prices. The staff is friendly and efficient. If you come in try the chicken fried steak, Pattie melt or the fish. Those are my favorites! But honestly you can't go wrong with anything you order."}
{"text":"First impressions set the stage. We were promptly greeted and seated.  I Had to wash my hands, the restroom was very clean for us clean freaks.  Menu had many breakfast choices, reasonably priced.  Three of us, all ordered different meals, all three of us were very pleased.   Even the coffee was good, not Starbucks, but good.  So why did I give it a 4 star, I asked for extra napkins, never got them. Rating should be 4.75.  We will definitely be back, one of the best in the Surprise area."}
{"text":"We don't dine out often, we are normally disappointed with some aspect of the experience. However we were very happy with both our food choices and our waitress.  Saturday breakfast Greek omelette and the cornbeef hash dish.  The diner was busy our only \"complaint\" the hostesses lack of greeting.  Will come back again and give her another chance."}
{"text":"Nicks 2 is always great, sometimes busy during the bird season. We are never disappointed and always leave fat and happy, this is one great breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"nice new location breakfast is OK and worth going back. not fantastic but it's a diner. big servings so if you're hungry go for it. nothing special but is good service and decent food if not real imaginative."}
{"text":"Find me here almost every Sunday morning for breakfast, and I never wait more than 10min to be sat. All the servers are efficient and friendly. The food is at a reasonable cost and usually comes out super fast! I've never been disappointed by a meal there, I usually try to always get something new! You can tell it's family based, and thats what makes the best restaurants!"}
{"text":"Always a great start to our Sunday of running errands and getting stuff done !! We love this place!!"}
{"text":"decent food, service was slow. bathroom was kinda dirty as well. I had the gyro on letter and it was quite tasty though. so of your looking for a quick good breakfast or lunch definitely check these guys out"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and tried the strawberry French toast! Huge portion and it was so good! I could not eat it all! We got seated immediately but it filled up really quickly! Everything that went by looked very good, so I'm sure we will be going back! Some menu items were a bit pricey, we eat out a lot so try to eat well on a budget, but portion size is big, so take home for second meal, or we will split it between the two of us!"}
{"text":"Took the kids this morning for breakfast. We'd never been here, so figured why not!
No wait at all which was nice.  We sat for 10+ minutes before the hostess had to tell our waitress we were waiting. To which she replied \"oh $***! Oooops!\" We ordered & w/ in 5-8 minutes the food was out already.....?! I ordered the biscuits & gravy. Blah! The gravy tasted like straight milk. No flavor at all. The biscuits were 1/2 way decent. The pancakes my son ordered were clearly made prior.....waaaaay prior to us ordering. They were rubbery & tough. He got 3 sausage links to go w/ them. They were under cooked. Our waitress came by only once & never offered to refill our drinks.
Hopefully this was just an \"off\" day for them. May try again - not sure."}
{"text":"Not even joking.....I could eat those home fries every day....super yummy! On our visit of 4/12/15, I loved the Vegetarian Skillet made with egg whites and feta cheese - absolute heaven! Other items at the table included the Denver Sandwich, the Meat-Lovers Skillet, and the French Toast.....I heard no complaining, just mmmmmm'ing around our table! Get to Nick's Diner II and start the day off right!"}
{"text":"I've only been a couple of times but every time we've been, it's been packed!!  We are greeted immediately, despite how busy they are.  The food has always been delivered quickly, hot and fresh, good, and the service has never disappointed.  Definitely worth your business!!"}
{"text":"My parents said this place had really good burgers so I was like OK let me go check it out, went in yesterday and really wasn't pleased. I wasn't even able to try the food because the service was not the best, the waitress just made my table and I feel really awkward like as if we were bothering her for anything. We ordered our drinks which were just like sprite and coke and they were extremely gross, I don't know what was wrong with all their fountain drinks or if it was just an off day for a nice beverage. When we asked her to change our drinks because cause they didn't taste all that great, she says \"what do you want me to do about it?\". Overall, I was kinda bummed cause we didn't get to try the burgers but it's all good, we ended up leaving after we payed for our drinks cause it just wasn't getting better, I probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We're not from this side of town, so we relied on Yelp to find us a place for breakfast. This place did not disappoint!! We had the Chicken Fried Steak, the meat skillet, a pancake, and a side potato cake. Everything was AMAZING!!!  The next time we're on this side of town, we definitely know where we're eating. Our food arrived quickly and there was SO MUCH food!!  Our waitress was so helpful with favorites on the menu, drink refills, special requests, and had a great personality. LOVED!!!  A+!!!  5!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have found our second home at nicks diner. We are always on the lookout for a mom and pop restaurant that still cares about the food and the customer and we found one so close to home.Nick the chef and owner will walk the floor greeting customers asking about your meal the food is delicious and consistent. You can tell he cares. Service you hardly see any more."}
{"text":"I really do love a good diner. Something about having great food with a cup of coffee gets me. 

Went there and got the breakfast pita. For about $6, the thing was as huge as the plate it came on and was extremely filling. I didn't even get half way through my Pita and I was already full. 

Service was fast as well. We ordered and within 10 minutes, our food was coming out super hot and delicious. 

The coffee was amazing and I would love to have another cup right! It's a must try during breakfast.. You gotta have coffee while at the diner!

They also have a $6 menu with tons of breakfast varieties for those who are on a budget. You get way more then what you pay for and its better then Mcdonalds!

I can't wait to try their lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a five if they didn't appear understaffed and the waitress hadn't provided such slow and subpar service. The food, when it arrived, was delicious, prices were good, especially the specials, the atmosphere was nice and the whole place was very clean. Overall, aside from the wait, we had a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The specials were very good, I ordered #1. The food came out fast, hot and correct! I will be going back."}
{"text":"Yuck. This place is just a poor excuse for a greasy spoon. Totally not worth the wait. Breakfast is on yhe south side of average and lunch isn't much better. I've never been for dinner.
Service is fine... nice waitstaff, nothing special...
Skip it."}
{"text":"Reminds me of back in NJ, where diners abound.  Good, comfort food at great prices!"}
{"text":"This is the best Friday fish fry we have found since relocating here.  Excellent batter and large portions.  The regular dinner is more than enough.  Consider sharing a FF and an appetizer or desert.  

M-F breakfast specials are reasonably priced.  Menu is a combination of traditional  diner food mixed with Greek items. 

Nick is authentic and cares about his customer's experience.  Many times he'll walk through the dining room and check in on you.  

Most of the wait staff are warm and engaging."}
{"text":"My in-laws are big fans of Nick's and Nick's II. I really don't know why. I can't figure out what the attraction is for the older crowd but there is a wait every time we come here as the restaurant is packed with older folks. Perhaps it's the large portions at cheap prices that has them overlooking the fact that the food is really not that great. The salad I had on our recent visit to Nick's II was a plate of romaine lettuce with a slice of tomato with 2 kalamata olives. Seriously. The veggie wrap didn't have any dressing or sauce with it and was so bland it was ridiculous. I asked for some balsamic and the server looked at me like I was crazy...and the balsamic never came. My husband had a ham and cheese sandwich that you would think would be hard to screw up...but again...blech. They used hand carved ham which SHOULD be WONDERFUL but they gave him the fattiest pieces on the ham so all he was chewing was huge hunks of fat. Not appetizing. The staff were all on edge because Nick (or at least who I think was Nick--older guy speaking with an accent wearing a Chef coat) was eagle-eyeing what the staff was doing in the dining room and critiquing. I wish he would spend more time in the kitchen and work on that dish-soap flavored chicken lemon rice soup or perhaps get creative instead of using frozen products to pass off as homemade. 

Again, I don't know what the attraction is to Nick's or Nick's II but I will be doing my best to avoid both locations. You get what you pay for when you pay for cheap food...."}
{"text":"Food is good. Their fish is superb. I also like the meatloaf platter and the gyro platter. The best is the Greek lemon chicken soup. Staff is accommodating and pleasant. They offer a $10 discount when you spend $100. Don't forget to ask for the card. Friday's all you can eat fish is very popular and there may be a wait for table. No reservation. Go early. Specials on different nights."}
{"text":"Food was good, server was rude.  The Friday fish fry was excellent with good sized portions.  Pork chops were good also.  Waitress was rude.  Told me to hurry up when ordering because she had other tables.  Even said \"smart ass\".  Guess I wasn't supposed to ask questions.  I didn't respond to her comments but she knew I was not pleased.  Others at our table also heard what she said.  Probably should have walked out, but didn't.  Lucky she got any tip at all.  Would have given 5 stars if the server hadn't been so rude."}
{"text":"I like this place.  I'd been to Nicks on Reems once but had never been back, not sure why because the food was good and cheap.  Maybe just because it's a little bit out of the way for me to get to but certainly not because of anything negative.  

The wife and I had a late breakfast at about 11AM.  The place was only about 1/4 full (snow birds are gone this time of year) so we were seated and waited on fairly promptly.  (the waitress was busy with a \"vendor\").  The wife had a simple plate of eggs, potatoes and a side of gravy and toast and I had the Greek Omelet with was really good.  Maybe a little bit too much feta cheese but that was OK, I just scrapped the excess off.  

When I rate a place I ask myself just one simple question:  Would I come back?  Easy answer it yes.  Of course this location is just a little bit out of my way but worth the effort to drive the 2 miles south of Bell Rd. for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"The very first time my husband and I went to the one on Reems. The food was good, the service was meh and for that reason I stopped going for a while. Then my husband and I decided to go again, only this time the service was slow and the waitress dropped something on the floor and she used a towel to wipe it up and then wiped the counter with that same towel, and never washed her hands and proceeded to pick up a plate of food and take it to a customer. My husband being the out spoken person that he is, called to the waitress that was serving us and told her about the situation with the other waitress. He didn't whisper either."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The best gyro I've ever had. Service is fast and food is very affordable. Worth your time."}
{"text":"I'd give Nick's 10 stars if I could!  The food in the restaurant is always consistently good and fresh, so I hired Nick to cater a small dinner party for my mom's birthday. I was over the top pleased with the beautiful food Nick provided. He prepared it just the way I asked and there was plenty to serve the number I expected.  It was delivered on time, hot.  Rib eye steaks, salad, veggies, potatoes, soup, bread. Basic but fabulous, better than from the steakhouse down the road and a smaller price tag. What a blessing to have such a delicious and excellent experience. Thank you Nick!"}
{"text":"I went to the diner with a friend who said it was a local favorite. I had a pretty standard breakfast order with eggs over easy, bacon and potatoes. The potato cakes are very good. Eggs and bacon are pretty standard however the atmosphere was \"modern family restaurant\" or \"modern diner.\" . Some vintage pieces throughout and a laid-back atmosphere... it is obvious some attention was paid to the cosmetic appeal of the dining area."}
{"text":"A great Valentines Day dinner!  Filet Mignon grilled shrimp baked potato veg and salad and cake!!! Job well done!  Perfect meal!  Thanks Nick and crew!!  An excellent meal!   John & Ginny"}
{"text":"I guess it is just standard place... Not impressed  at all. Ordered Greek omelette, it came without any flavor. I do it better at home! Ok, checked first time, no reason to come here again..."}
{"text":"My wife wanted to go there after church because it was close to the house.... The service as well as the food was mediocre at best.... So many better places  to go in Surprise... Rio Mirage Cafe on Litchfield is my Favorite..."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Hash browns were blah, steak was good. Coffee is great. Prices are really good. Service is slighter better than average. Nothing to write home about and too many other options in the area to make a return trip."}
{"text":"Very good food, first time here. Had breakfast. Best gravy we've ever had. Food was awesome, service was awesome. Will definitely come back, will probably become regulars and highly recommend this place. 

10-8-17. 2 years later we still come here all the time and bring new people with us all the time.  Still awesome food and awesome service."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  They completely messed up our take out order.  The food was not even close to what we ordered.  They were very rude about making the order correct (which they messed up) then it was remade wrong again and still not what we ordered.  We called to speak to the owner who was the rudest man I have ever encountered.  The worst customer service experience I have ever had.  The man literally yelled at us that we had ordered the wrong thing when he wasn't even there when it happened and I certainly know what I ordered.  I have never encountered such awful customer service.  Trust me you can find better food and service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Upon first entering, it resembles any ordinary diner.  But once you sit, the service is top notch.  Food is outstanding, like the gyros platter and tasty breakfasts.  And... the friday fish fry is best in town.  I've tried them all and this fry is the 'bomb !!'  Plus, on all my visits, Nick himself greets each table and checks the quality of his food.  Cool Beans !"}
{"text":"This is my goto breakfast diner
 It is further from my home than a few other places but the drive is worth. First off, the place is really big with a ton of waitresses/waiters. Service is quick. Portions are large. Prices are low. Quality is high. I've never eaten here during lunch or dinner so I can't comment on that. For the mamy times that I have beem here, the food and service were top notch.

When people ask me where tovgo for a solid breakfast, I always poiilnt them in the direction of Nick's Diner 2. Don't go to Nick's Diner 1 because that place is trash."}
{"text":"My family loves to come here for breakfast. Also super good food, love the home fries I get.
Food is simple delicious and reasonably priced. Only complaint I have about this place is my cell phone service sucks for some reason. Must be all the good aroma blocking the cellular signal."}
{"text":"We went to Nick's Diner II for a family dinner. I was told it was a great place and I read reviews about this place. I was not disappointed.

We got there and it was busy but the wait for our group was about 15 minutes. We didn't even wait that long. Not long after we were seated our waitress Debra came for out drink order and came back super quick. She was so friendly and patient with all of us and whenever we requested anything she was happy to help and brought it back fast. Empty drink cups were quickly replaced with new ones. 

The food was really good and a large portion. I got he spaghetti and meatballs which Debra said was really good. She was right! The fork cut right through the meatball and the rest of the dish was delicious. 

This place was well worth the drive out. Everyone working there was very friendly and seemed they really enjoyed working there. Debra is a great waitress and really takes care of her customers. If you're lucky to have her, you'll be well taken cared of. I will for sure come back here."}
{"text":"Another good experience when looking on yelp for food places. Our waiter was nice. Food came out fast! Good food good homie feeling. Thanks yelpers!"}
{"text":"Not at all like your stereotypical diner. They have unique food items and very reasonable pricing. The food is made to order and is served hot. They have pretty big plates so don't over order you will not be able to finish. They serve everyone quickly and make sure the tables are cleaned so those waiting get right in."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Surprise. New location is very nice inside and was well done. 

Always quick reception and friendly. Service is excellent and they are always on top of needs and checking back often. 

The food is served quickly and always looks good. 

I love the Nicks omelet and Nicks Skillet with gyro meat. 

Wife and daughter enjoy omelets, potato pancakes and their breakfast plates. Never disappointed. 

I have had lunch items in past and highly recommend the gyros combo."}
{"text":"Fantastic Lunch!!!! The club sandwich was thick, loaded with meat and DELICIOUS!! Service was just the Best too. Can't wait to try his Pizza place across the street!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here before. I think it was the morning of my birthday but I'm not sure. I came with two friends. Since it has been months since the time that I tried this place I don't remember exactly what I had. I know that I had a sandwich and it tasted amazing. I wanna say I got a pickle on the side. Which I'm a pickle fanatic so I was very pleased. I do remember that we had great service from the waitress. She was very attentive. I was impressed with the food and I would definitely try his place again when I have the chance. It's a pretty decent sized place as well.  Oh well here's a picture I was able to find of what I had!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place to eat.
We use to eat at the original's Nick's until we started to have a few issues. Later we found out that Nick's and Nick's ll are not related? Nick's ll are the original owners of Nick's, but then sold the original Nick's. Then they opened up Nick's ll, there does that explain everything? I now confused! 
Anyway, I have had breakfast here a couple of times. It's pretty much the same as the original Nick's. But this place seems to be more customer service priority. You are treated a lot better here, and don't forget about you. Food is really good, I personally love their pancakes. Their bagel breakfast sandwich is very good also. There are a lot of options for breakfast in Surprise, and this is one of the better ones."}
{"text":"Our go-to restaurant. I absolutely love this place. The owner is so kind and always goes table to table to check on the guests. The staff are always kind. The food is good and consistent. Which really matters. Cost is reasonable. Considering the portion sizes too. They have a punch card that offers a free meal after so many visits. Highly recommend the breakfast menu. And Sunday cinnamon rolls. A great place to take kids too."}
{"text":"My family and I love going to Nicks for  Breakfast as the food is always good, and the waitresses are friendly with quick service. The servers provide excellent customer service and keep your coffee cup filled. I especially like the choice of flavored creamers. Also, the bathroom is kept clean. I recommend Nicks as there is never too long of a wait and the prices are decent."}
{"text":"hello this was my fist time going there i see that its always  busy and  o boy that's right if you go there  make sure to get your name on the list to be seated  time there was a wait for us it was 15  to 2o minutes not bad because there was soo much people the  server Margaret was so  helpful and friendly and was on top  she   even gave us a punch card make  sure to ask for one  it you plan on going there more than once the proce for what you get is great too"}
{"text":"Holy giant cinnamon roll! We came here on a Sunday morning at 9 and there was about a ten minute wait. We ordered the Greek omelet which had gyro meat and feta cheese and it was pretty good. The eggs seemed a little dry but the fillings were good. The sourdough toast was really yummy! We ordered the cinnamon roll and we were blown away at how big it was. It was the size of a full dinner plate! It was really good for being so big. It wasn't dry or anything and it had a ton of frosting. We ate about a quarter of it and took the rest home. They only have them on Sunday mornings and it was only $5! We liked this place overall but probably won't come back unless we want a cinnamon roll because it was kind of far from us."}
{"text":"Been living in Arizona for 20 years. My husband and I look forward to our weekly dining at our favorite restaurant. The eggplant is delicious and my husband enjoys the salmon. If we go early we enjoy happy hour with angel hair pasta delicious
Sauce and pizza.  The food isn't that unhealthy fried stuff sitting in oil like other happy hours, in even the priciest restaurant. The restaurant is busy and  the staff is always pleasant and patient with any order we request"}
{"text":"Brand new!!! Where Bronco Billys uses to be. My dad loves Nicks, and is super excited!! I've never been before, but will be back. Remember, they just opened. Have some patience."}
{"text":"Good food, good price. Its a little dark and drab, but it has a huge breakfast menu."}
{"text":"This is a great, quiet place to get an awesome breakfast! 

Their service is quick, their prices are low and the food is good! 

I love their potato cakes (hash browns), id recommend getting them well done if you like them crispy."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place.  Great potatoe pancakes and cinnamon rolls.  Always give great service.  Will always support local businesses nick keep up the great work.  Stephanie is a sweetheart she always makes you 
  Dont let her go"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here with my husband this morning. Becky our server was sweet as pie. We would def come back again."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the worst experiences from a business to date and I have had some bad ones. I ordered delivery from them from a service and the first order was wrong ok no biggie. Called to get it fixed and have another sent out. The second order was again wrong. This process took around 2.5 hours and by then Nick's was closed so we just ate the incorrect food.
 I called back when the owner was in to discuss what had happened and he said I should be happy with the wrong food and it was my fault.  This progressed to the point where he used profanity and was screaming.  Mind you when I spoke to both the restaurant and the delivery service they both said the kitchen had NEW staff and were experiencing issues on the night I was having problems and to just call back and speak to the owner.  
  I have eaten there in the past but will NEVER eat there again.  No one should be treated that way and if I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Have never had bad service at Nicks it a great Family place Breakfast,Dinner you name it and my grandkids Love the Cinnamon Roll on Sunday and I like that the Coffee keeps coming and that the amount of food makes 3-4 meals for myself you have to give it a try Going to try a Grilled Chicken tonight for Dinner and I know it will be good"}
{"text":"This is a favorite lunch break spot for my co-workers and I, because the menu is so diverse. You can get Greek, Italian, traditional American, and just plain 'ol breakfast foods all at the same place. How do I know this already? Strangely, they have another location on Reems and Greenway, while this \"Diner II\" is a 5 minute drive away at Litchfield and Waddell! 

The staff is so friendly here! It's like being greeted on the show Cheers whenever we come in. They know that I always order Greek chicken kabobs with a side order of the chicken lemon rice soup. If you are ever ill or someone you love is ill, get a bowl of their chicken lemon rice soup, and trust me, you'll feel better! It's seriously must be what the Chicken Soup for the Soul book must be based on (well, aside from the typical \"Aw\" feel good stories).

The gyros are ginormous! I just wish that the feta cheese on the side wasn't extra, because gyros don't seem to be gyros without the cheese! 

My friend, Kerry M., loves the fact that breakfast is served all day. She's had the biscuits and gravy dish and the hash browns which she said were delicious!

I will continue to go to Nicks Diner I and II, because I enjoy their food, their company, and I love to support local restaurants. There are no bells and whistles, like swanky walls or posh decor (in fact, this location is super green... not kidding... walls, booths, tables...) This place is all about just comfort food for laid back people."}
{"text":"So discovered along with the move to a new location Nick has updated 
and now has a whole new website with his full menu. Ordered carry-out last night for my wife and I and had a great experience."}
{"text":"It's a mom and a pop shop...   It's a little bit too greasy for me.  The plates and cups look average.  Maybe it is to give it the I am at home look and not the I am eating out look.  I see other people enjoy the food, maybe I had the wrong cook.  I ordered breakfast with hash browns.  If I ever get on this side of town again I might try it just in case other food is more to my liking."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time to Nick's Diner 2.  We live right around the corner so we had to try it.  Well...it was delish!  I had the special which was a chicken kabob, gyro meat, and rice.  There was enough food for 2 people with extra.  It came with soup, pita, onion, and ttomato.  You even got free pie too.  All for 10$.  Everything was hot and tasty.   Three of us ate for 38$, and that was with drinks, and bringing home leftovers for lunch or dinner tomorrow.  I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This place is packed whenever I arrive, and it's definitely with good reason. Whether you come for the breakfast special, some burgers, or to sample some Greek food, you always be satisfied. Try their saganaki! 
Nick wanders around the floor and asks people at each table if they're happy with the food and the service. It's like eating in Greece! The only difference is he's not sitting down with you, though that probably doesn't work with the crowds of people that come through. 
We love this place."}
{"text":"Yummy! So this is what 'real corn beef hash' should look like and taste? I've only been here for breakfast, now I have to try their lunch & dinner. If you go there for breakfast, get their early or expect to wait. It's a small and popular place."}
{"text":"Eh, it was ok. Food was mediocre. Bacon gross-all three of us didn't eat it. After seeing their menu along with pricing and atmosphere.... Wished we would have chose Denny's. Sticky syrup bottles are gross to me and they all were on the tables I could see or I would have grabbed one from another table. Would not return, also place has a funky smell when u walked in."}
{"text":"So we were in town foe the air show and decided to find a breakfast place. We yelped and this came back as having good reviews and was right down the road from the base, so we gave it a shot. You walk in and its a pretty busy diner with the usual fair and decor. We sat at the bar since we needes to get in and out to see the air show. I got the basic breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast, and homefries. I must say their homefries are the best kind I have had....EVER! The rest of my meal was pretty damn tasty. My girlfriend got French toast with eggs and bacon. She said it was pretty good but nothing to special. The service the whole time I was there was amazing. Drinks never went dry, food was quick, and they were friendly. Tip to the owners, who ever is expediting your food needs to chill out with the yelling though, the cooks must hate her hahaha. All in all, if you want good food near the base, this is a stop for sure!"}
{"text":"Wasn't as good as everyone said it was. Very disappointed. We went for breakfast and the French toast was burnt, the pancakes were like a frisbee and eggs Benedict was terrible. Greasy. Yuck!  Not in any hurry to go back."}
{"text":"Mixed review here!  The chicken lemon soup was wonderful, hot and flavorful. But, my marinated chicken pita sandwich did not taste like chicken, and upon inspection did not look like chicken either.  I asked my he waitress if it was chicken, and she replied that I didn't order chicken. Since I don't eat lamb, I know I didn't order lamb, but she insisted I had and showed my her order pad where she had written my order as a gyro. My husband hates making a scene, but even he said that he was sure I had ordered marinated chicken, but she was certain I had not. She did then offer to have them make me a new meal but at that point I had really lost my appetite from having eaten the lamb and declined. I scraped the lamb off the pita, left it on my plate, and ate the pita. 
I worked in a restaurant in a previous life and you did not argue with customers about what they ordered, you either got them a correct order with no questions or took it off their bill. I got neither. Kind of sad."}
{"text":"I prefer the old Nick's Diner II at the old location. At the new location, they now have a hostess to seat you. A hostess, who's not welcoming and already looked stressed before she seats you. The waitresses are the same people from the old who tells you, Seat wherever you like...hands you the menu and gets your drink right away. Now, they appear fancy, slow, and NOT welcoming only to those few they knew. I sat at the bar for breakfast by myself to give bigger parties the table. The food was delivered to me with attitude and had to ask for coffee for refill. I like to support local businesses, but will no longer go back, nor will bring friends to Nick's Diner. It wasn't my first time to go to the new place. Went again for the second time, and same unnecessary busyness and unfriendly attitude. Can't enjoy the food with negative feelings. I have lots of choices minus this one."}
{"text":"I mean, it's a diner. The food is diner food. It's adequate. Service isn't bad. It's always jam packed with people. Order was accurate and coffee was fresh diner coffee. It's nothing special, but it wasn't bad. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"We love this place! The breakfast is homemade fresh and hot. The service is always great and very welcoming. My fiancé and I always try new places but end up back at good old Nicks. A couple times we had off days the food was just ok but it still nocked most places out of the water. Way to go Nicks we love ya"}
{"text":"This place is our go to for Sunday breakfast. It gets packed in there and there's usually a wait, but they get you in quick."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a family owned diner style restaurant.  I love supporting small local business which is why we gave this place a try.  The place is somewhat small and can get crowded in a hurry which is okay.  I have only tried this place for breakfast.  

Their \"omelets\" are more like scrambles.  They kind of just scramble the egg with what should be the filling and then just fold it in half when its done.  The potatoes are not seasoned and somewhat dry and crumbly.  The pancakes are good but nothing extraordinary.  

The service can leave a little to be desired.  It depends on who you get but the underlying theme seems to be that they are all family or close friends.  I don't mind this but it seems to contribute to the lax service . 

It is an average joint for breakfast.  I will explore other options but wouldn't fight it too hard if I had to give it another try."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, Delicious made from scratch food. The Best! You'll come back again and again. Owner and staff are Super Friendly and attentive.  They treat you like family :)"}
{"text":"Me and the family ate here on a Friday evening. I have diet restrictions so I got a single piece of grilled cod and a side of potatoes. The husband got eggs, potatoes, sausage and French toast. My daughter got the bacon cheeseburger. The place was full and Friday is the fish fry. Our server was really good and attentive and the food came out fast. The cod was really good. It flaked and was light with good flavoring just the way cod should be. The potatoes were a little different than home style I am used to. They were shavings pretty much. They give you huge portions for the price so it was worth it. My husband couldn't even eat all of his and my daughter couldn't get close to finishing her burger. Overall a nice little diner . It is clean and bright inside and they have beer as well."}
{"text":"Nick's is a great place for all ages!
Good food, good service, good prices, & good value"}
{"text":"Go! Be hungry or be ready to share. I had the #1 breakfast & it was under $9.00. ihop,village inn or Denny's can't touch the place for breakfast. You have to go & see for yourself. The staff is awesome & your food is out fast! They also have an A food rating from the health department! We will be returning for a lunch & dinner."}
{"text":"Same menu...great new location.  New place has bar seating and a nice selection of draft beers.  Large portions for a reasonable price.  The tradition continues..."}
{"text":"In town from SD for Spring Training baseball. Party of 1...Sat at the bar for breakfast. Place must be popular with the locals. Waiting area was packed. Sat down. Greeted promptly. Offered coffee and water. 

Ordered the Sunday special Cinnamon Roll. ITS HUGE! Very warm. Sweet frosting. Soft and gooey. So good. It'll take days to finish. 

Main course was the Breakfast Pita with Swiss. It reminds me of a Denver scramble in a pita. Very good. Came out piping hot...which is good...I don't feel like I have to scarf it down before it gets cold (in fact, I write this waiting for it to cool). Comes with home fried potatoes. Nothing special. Looking around...all the food looks good!

I will return!"}
{"text":"The food is good, service fast, and the portions LARGE!!!! I'm stopping on my way home and we got this place. My breakfast feels more like dessert! If I lived in this place I'd be huge! A must for the locals. They even do fish frys!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving Nicks one star not based on the food but how bad I saw the owner Nick constantly berating his very hard working staff today. It really made for a uncomfortable meal as we watched the employees all running around working and Nick just constantly nit picking at them. I will not support a business where the owner has no respect for his employees who make him money...so done with this place unless there is a big attitude change by the owner."}
{"text":"Good breakfast - but they need to expand the Nicks on Reems rd in surprise - too small too busy at times"}
{"text":"What a nice hometown restaurant!   The inside looks really nice.  Newly remodeled.  Even my 12 yr old commented on how nice it looked inside.  The staff are super friendly. Our waitress was quick to get us refills and very personable. The menu covers everything from breakfast to dinner. I was impressed when they brought out the food. The portions are ginormous!   And the food tastes very good.  We had appetizers as well but I forgot the pic.  It was very good. All in all, I think we've found a favorite."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. Depending on who you get, service can be good or mediocre. The food in the other hand is really good with way too many choices. I enjoy the gyro, veal parmesan?, salads, and breakfasts. My parents like it here as well. There is often extra for them to take him for lunch the next day as the portions tend to be large."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and service. Bacon was extra crispy just the way I like it and the eggs over easy were perfect. Fast and great food, will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We are relatively new to the area. I researched local restaurants and Nicks popped up. I am so glad that it did. We were seated promptly, Probably because we came at 2:00 p.m. Surprisingly enough the place was pretty well populated. Nick's must have a great breakfast. Many of the patrons had ordered so.
The old man ordered the gyro platter, and I the lamb shank. The gyro was rated good from my picky husband. (He never says anything is great), so a \"good\" from him is a huge compliment. My lamb was great. It was tender, and served in a tomato sauce. Accompanying was rice and mixed vegetables...I asked for a piece of baklava to go. Our server said that the sweet was on a square of aluminum foil, because it had just come from the oven. This was the best baklava I have ever had.
I am looking forward to coming to Nick's for the Sunday special, a Giant Cinnamon Roll. Heads up! We discovered the hard way Nick's closes at 2:00 Sunday.
Yes Virginia, there is a real Nick! He can be found in his kitchen, and outside of such checking out his domain."}
{"text":"Just ate there this afternoon and was disappointed. Usually takes a lot to bug me, but this place had too many red flags. First of all, the floor around our table was filthy with food. We had to ask them to clean it. The floor was super slippery and our chairs and table kept sliding everywhere. The beef skewer of my combo kabob was filled was fat and I had to ask them to take it back and replace it with chicken. My wife asked if they had any other veggie to put on her omelet, waitress said spinach, but failed to mentioned it cost an extra $1.50, as we saw on the bill. Food was bland and not very tasty. Lastly, their slogan, \"Where hunger meets it's match,\"  is plastered in big letters on front of the menu and the workers' shirt. \"It's\" is misspelled (see middle school grammar) and another sign of their unprofessionalism. If I owned the restaurant, that would have been the first thing I would have corrected. Sorry, nothing in this place made me feel comfortable or have a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"It's been a very hectic week so we decided to take some time off and have a meal at Nick;s II now located on Waddell in Surprise. Cindy was our server and did an outstanding job, very attentive and friendly. My wife ordered the hamburger and egg plate. She is very picky about her meals, eggs over hard and almost burn the burger which is exactly what she got, happy wife, happy life the motto that I live by. I ordered the club sandwich which is a long time favorite of mine and I too am picky. Bacon must be crispy and don't skimp on the turkey, lightly toasted bread and crispy fries. My meal was made to my specs exactly. The sandwich was so big that I had to take home 1/2 of it for later on. I can't more than 5 stars but I would if I could. Keep up the great work Nick, Cindy and the whole staff"}
{"text":"Full house at Nick's Diner today! Luckily it did not stop us from getting seated in a timely manner. Clean establishment with friendly and helpful employees. 

Now lets get to the food! Our group had 2 orders of the Country Fried Steak, Belgium Waffles and French Toast with Bacon and a side of eggs. Waffles were buttery, chicken fried steak was perfectly cooked, bacon was crispy and the french toast was pretty decent. Also, for as much people as there were, we received our food very quick! That to me shows great dedication and customer service from the workers. Thank you guys! 

Overall great place, great food and great people. I highly recommend it! 5 Stars for the service we received, thank you Deborah!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go here about once a week. They have great food and great service! Nick also comes out from the kitchen to check on his customers personally to make sure they love their meals. Couldn't ask for a better neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went to their New location over by the theater and I really like this building better.Bigger layout, better chairs and booths. Service was excellent ,attentive , refills right on time. Food was as good as always. I would only subtract half A star, because the beer wasn't quite as cold as it should have been ,they had just barely turned on the tap system at the start of happy hour. However,appears they have more draft beer choices overall. Thumbs up to Nicks again!     Ok updating Sept 2, we went again and this time the draft beer was cold and good. Food fresh and good, service good. Only complaint is that that the AC is too warm, we were all sweating like mad even though it was not packed nor was it above 105 today. Someone else complained about ac in amother review--needs to be fixed.!"}
{"text":"Awesome family spot. Many different meals to choose from. Nice enough staff. Has a local feel to it. The Chicken Pita is insanely good and the breakfast platters are quite sizable. Bring some friends and chit-chat at a table or chill on the counter and shoot the breeze with the staff. Different dinner specials everyday."}
{"text":"This place is WONDERFUL!
My boyfriend and I live nearby and have driven by this place many times and never tired it until today - shame on us. The menu has something for everyone and they serve breakfast all-day. The portions are huge, service is quick, and the servers are great! I had the gyro and it was the best I have ever had - not dry - and plenty of tzatziki sauce. Yummy! My boyfriend had the ruben sandwich and it was also amazing! The onions rings are so large and not greasy and are delicious dipped in thousand island dressing. We can't wait into come back again - we found our new place to eat and love supporting a local business - this place is the best! Looking forward to coming on Sunday for breakfast and trying those HUGE cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"If there was a zero start I would have given it. This place is clearly not big on diversity. Beginning with the girl that sat us. It was as if we may be lost. The waitress seemed annoyed to wait in is and the loss on her face showed it. All that could have been overlooked if the food were good but this is the blandest, no flavor food i think I've ever eaten. The cinnamon roll that is supposed to be one of the excitement of coming was hard and cold upon delivery. Don't ask for coffee because you won't get a refill. Even my mother who never complains was dissatisfied. We drove 20 minutes to be thoroughly disappointed by this \"4\" star (not) place. I want my money back."}
{"text":"Have eaten there many times; at the location north of Waddell and at the new location across from the movie theater on the southwest corner.  Food has been consistent.  Not at all busy on Tuesday evening, 05 Jul.  We were seated right away and that was it.....sat there 10 mins and was not as much as acknowledged by a waitress assigned to our section......so we left and went elsewhere to eat.

NO WAITRESS  ! ! !   Nick II lost a customer"}
{"text":"Ok. The food is good. Atleast what we had was good. The thing I had a problem with was the waitress. My wife ordered an omlet and she asked for the potatoes on the outside. You would think she insulted this girls first born child with this request. She gave her the worst look ever. And the were on the inside to no ones surprise. Not saying a word, not refilling drinks. I just dont get it. I really think they need a suicide prevention course, she looked depressed. So OK food and bad staff. Depends on what bothers you I suppose. I cant handle bad staff at all and will never go back because of it. 

Edit. Forgot to mention the lengthy conversation she thought we should have about her period, and by converdation I mean just tell us about it for 20 minutes.............. so yeah..........."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place in the west valley. If you want great food come to nicks II at Litchfield and Waddell in the Fry's shopping center"}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great place...everything we have eaten has been very tasty.  Their hamburgers were so good we were very pleasantly surprised!  The gyro omelette is my favorite.  So good!"}
{"text":"I will never visit your restaurant again. Service was horrible. The wait staff moves at a snails pace. I gave you 3 chances to get it right but every time you were a disappointment. How is the soup ALWAYS cold when I get it???"}
{"text":"Our breakfast was okay / alright. It came out at lightening speed, and considering how busy it was, that was quite an achievement! I wasn't a fan of the coffee and found it a bit tasteless, and the scrambled eggs lacking in any flavor too. My biggest gripe was $5.80 for 2 glasses of milk. This is the equivalent practice of charging more for soft drink than beer in bars downtown. Next time, I'll buy my own gallon at Fry's and bring that instead. It was also just shy of $40 to feed 3 of us. That's pretty expensive going....on the plus side, the table service was great, and the pancakes were huge."}
{"text":"To be clear, Nick's 2 is not affiliated with Nick's 1 anymore.  Different owners.  I used to go to Nick's 1 when Nick was there but no more.  He runs his shop much better.  Too my surprise they have moved to a new building and I really love the place.  I am single and don't like taking up a table just for myself so I sit up at the bar.  The food is always great and Nick always waves me over to sit with him when I come in.  Great restaurant owner and runs a very good place.  I eat there mostly for breakfast, but really like the Fish Fry on Fridays as well.  My friends tell the burgers are really good as well but I would rather have a Gyro.  He gets a really good sausage for breakfast that I have never seen anywhere else as well.  For my money, it is the best breakfast and Greek diner in Surprise."}
{"text":"Great food , staff seemed overwhelmed constantly however. I would recommend but would warn that service is lacking"}
{"text":"All I can say is YUMMY!!! Love this place!! Great food and service, sometimes the wait can be frustrating but that's because it's soooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best things about moving to a new area is trying all the food places. Been eyeing this place since I pasted it in my moving truck. Went in tonight just to grab something to go! Glad i did! Walked in and very CLEAN!! A big plus!! Nice crowd of patrons, so thought it had to be good!! Got the Gyro an steak fries. Great choice! An the HUGE A** onionrings!! ALL GOOD!!! Looked over the menu an so many different choices for NEXT time!! Service was remarkable! Fast an nice! Gonna have to sit down next time an enjoy it there! Check-ins will follow!!!"}
{"text":"Made a yelp account just for this went in here yesterday and got there burger and side of frys and my older brother got some steaks and said they were the best ever will go again in future too."}
{"text":"My family and I tried Nicks second location for their Friday Fish Fry recently,  and it was one of the worst dining experiences we had not just in Surprise, but Valley wide!  I realize Surprise has little to offer outside of fast food chains and sports bars, but how the place was packed I'll never know.

The first sign of trouble was when we walked in the door.  They either don't want to pay the utility bill to properly cool the restaurant, or do t want to pay to have the unit fix.  Either way, the temp felt like it was in the 85-90 degree range.  The next issue was with the waitstaff.  Our server couldn't even greet us when she came to our table.  When our drinks came, my glass had two big cracks on the sides, but yet the server just shrugged it off.  As for the fish it's self.  I wish I could say it was even average, but it was almost all batter.  The portion had very little meat, and was mostly just over cooked hard batter.  While they are at it, maybe it could be served without the pool of oil, and grease bubbling?

Overall I hate being negative in my reviews, but this place earned every bit of it.  If the staff cared even a little bit, and didn't take their loyal customers for granted, the dinning experience would probably be significantly better."}
{"text":"They were very busy while we were there with only one or two tables open at a time. Even so we had great service with the waitress coming multiple times to check on us. Nick grew up in Greece and went to culinary school there so I would recommend his Greek food.  We had Saganaki, which is flaming cheese, and it was as good as we've had anywhere. I had lemon chicken and rice soup, it was creamy, thick and seasoned perfectly. I also had a gyros sandwich, the meat was tender and juicy, the pita was soft, the tzatziki sauce tasty, the onions were thinly sliced. If we had only ordered Greek food they would've had a five star rating from us. My husband ordered a hamburger which was overcooked, unseasoned, and came with the dry bun. He would've only given it one star.  The fries that came with burger were steak fries and were four stars"}
{"text":"As good as the original. Comfort food at its best. Great portions and friendly attentive service. Always a great place for breakfast. We always bring friends from out of town."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall spot is awesome! Great prices, huge portions and very fast service. Do yourself a favor and check out this place. And yes the wait that you will more than likely run into is worth it."}
{"text":"I have only had lunch here.  One at the old location on Litchfield and once at the new location next tow the theater.  The Gyro is freakin' amazing to say the least.  The fries are the big steak fries like Red Robin and cooked till they are brown and crispy.  Its a lot of food, so if your not hungry, your taking home left overs.  Place is always packed and I love the new counter to eat since I'm always solo.  I read through a bunch of the reviews and figuring out that the bad ones are most likely from the Nicks I on Reems which is non related owner.  I have seen Nik both times in the restaurant touching tables and saying hi to everyone. Coming from LI, NY, this place is the best if your used to back East diners and quick, hot tasty food and its cheap."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm the blueberry pancakes here are to die for! Great service. Be prepared to wait if you're coming on the weekends especially Sunday mornings. It is one one the best breakfast stops in Surprise."}
{"text":"Love Nick's Diner II, they have great made from scratch food at reasonable prices. Breakfast is my favorite, huge portions, great coffee, and the biggest cinnamon roll I have seen outside of Texas. I am a regular here."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for brunch this morning...there was a short wait (that was expected), but once we were seated, everything was great.  Our waitress was funny and nice, our drinks were brought to us right away and the food was really good.  Warning...there is a lot of food!!

Two of my friends left with boxes, the rest of us powered through and ate everything...so tasty!  I ordered the gyro pita sandwich, and it was great.  Would I get it again??  Yep!  Another friend got a salad and added the gyro meat, she loved it...someone else had a spinach and feta omelet, with a side of pancakes...both the omelet and pancakes were huge!  And, the final two friends...one got the pancakes with a fried egg and a side of biscuits & gravy (which she devoured) and the other one got corned beef hash with a Belgian waffle...the waffle looked delicious! 

Everyone seemed to really enjoy themselves!  Looking forward to going here again...I just might try that waffle next time...yummy!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. But being honest this wasn't the true diner experience. We were sat in the rear of the diner and it took probably 20 mins to be approached for our meal order. We were exercising patience and waited for our server but ended up being greeted by someone other than  our drink person. Totally confused. Order took 15 mins to show up. Food was Ok... not mind boggling. Dissapointing we were hoping to find a diner in this area."}
{"text":"Nicks is never bad whether it's the original on Reems or the new one on Litchfield.  For those complaining about the new location, I suggest realizing that this is a new location for Nick and he's obviously still trying to work out all the kinks.  If you ask to speak to Nick (and he's there), he'll come out and listen to what you have to say and will do what he can to make your experience the best.  If you've ever been to the one on Reems, then you'd know that he doesn't accept 'mediocre' for his customers.    And for the guy comparing Nicks to Rio Mirage, that's like comparing apples to oranges.  Nicks is a diner, not a Mexican food joint.   I frequent both the new and old Nicks and although there are slight differences, it won't be long before the new one will be just as awesome as his other one."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to spot.....Fish Fridays...Burgers...Gyros....you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time for an early dinner. Space fresh looking and servers young and accommodating. Happy hour offers beer specials, I was even offered a sample. I ordered a Sirloin streak dinner my companion a hamburger. Both came cooked to order and you can tell this meat was fresh not frozen. Sides were tasty and adequate. It was Wednesday and free pie offered w our meals . Thumbs down on the apple but cherry pie was just OK. This is definitely a step up from diners back east but with that homie feel. If I lived here I would become a regular but just visiting. Give them a try."}
{"text":"It wasn't horrible, but probably won't come back. We got sat pretty quick and the service was good. However, the food was not that good. There's no other way to say it, besides food was a 3 Star!  Will try other places here on out"}
{"text":"Nick's Diner II is excellent but not to be confused with Nick's Diner, both of which are in Surprise. However in all fairness, I have not tried Nick's Diner.

Nick's II does it all right! Good tasting food, friendly staff, fast service and affordable prices. My wife and I eat here 2-3 times per month.

Try the Chicken Gyro with a Greek Salad! Nick makes his Greek Dressing from scratch...DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Staff always friendly service is great, the food is good & plentiful. One of the best in Surprise,Az.."}
{"text":"If you're over 60 and like a light meal, don't ask for the children's portion. They won't sell you the lighter meal. Also, if you order half a sandwich and soup, don't be surprised when your soup is only slightly warm.  We were not impressed and will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow, I was pleasantly surprise today when I ate here for dinner. 
I went to their old location once and was very turned off by everything....food, atmosphere, everything... but this place made a 360 and for the better!

Service: 5/5 excellent
Very attentive waiters and staff

Food: 5/5 excellent
I ordered the \"Lobster Ravioli\" with side salad (~12). The salad was a fresh spring mix blend served with greek olives and tomatoes. The Lobster Ravioli was delicious and the sauce was creamy. It was just right. My husband ordered the \"Gyro Plate\" with \"Lemon Chicken Soup\" (~$10). Large portion size, decent gyro meat. Came with rice, chopped tomatoes and raw onions, pita bread, and tatziki sauce. He liked it but thought it was missing something.  The soup was different and we both enjoyed it.

Atmosphere: 5/5 excellent
Clean, casual atmosphere. Very open.

We will be back again. Don't forget to get the punch card if you come here to eat."}
{"text":"So today, I decided to stop in for a bite before I got my errands going. I only waited less than 5 mins to be seated which was fine. I was seated at a large table (seats 4) but it was only me. They asked what I wanted to drink before I was seated which I thought was smart and walked me to the table with my drink. After I was seated I waited for about 10-15 mins before being acknowledged for my order to be taken. Servers kept walking past my table with no one stopping though my menu was closed because I knew exactly what I wanted. Finally my order was taken and my food came out but no one asked or came to refill my drink either as I was eating ice. It took another ten mins or so for someone to acknowledge I needed my check. I'll for sure return but today I was a little disappointed, but I'll count it as a fluke."}
{"text":"Nick 2 Diner is A MUST FOR ANYONE!
Time after time the service and food are above par. Breakfast at Nick's can't be beat by anyone.  Food is really done right the servers are always pleasant and the restaurant is immaculately clean. Nick is there almost all the time. I would recommend Nick's 2 highly .
It's a must go to , DEFINITELY"}
{"text":"Discovered this hidden gem in Surprise AZ a year ago. Now it's our regular breakfast/lunch spot when we're visiting the NW Phoenix area. 

Great menu, fresh ingredients. So far everything is tasty good. 

Love that breakfast is served all day! I had a gyro on our last visit. Since the owner was raised in Greece I knew it would be good."}
{"text":"Nicks is super busy, my wife and I had to wait for a bit to get in. That's fine though, it's okay to wait to have a great experience and/or food. Now onto my experience. The host didn't seem too friendly but wasn't rude/mean probably just her demeanor. The small tables for two dont really make sense. I tried to get in to one but with the lack of spacing between tables and people we couldnt get in. Once seated we were served immediately by bring drinks and asking to take our order. The employees seem to be on top of things and work really well with each other the flow was pretty amazing watching them take care of everyone and giving everyone one an appropriate amount of time/attention. I ordered a number 6 with a side of eggs. It was good not great, as I felt the eggs and sausage were bland. My wife got the vegetarian skillet, again really bland she had to season it to get it to be okay. She said the mushrooms tasted mushy/canned but other than that and the whole thing tasting bland. We both had water which tasted weird i also had coffee and was happy with the flavored cream they have at the table. Again the service here is good, but the servers could be friendlier. I'd come back and hope the next time the food would be better by trying something else."}
{"text":"We both came home sick. Within 5 minutes of leaving, my borderline had stomach pain and needed to vomit. (He had the open faced roast beef sandwich.) I barely made it to the bathroom at home... I had a hamburger. I'm sad to say we'll never go back."}
{"text":"The best chicken fried steak around. Friendly staff. Love this place get the same thing every time. Always great. Service is awesome."}
{"text":"Good breakfast that comes fast and is served hot. Very affordable pricing as well. I've been 4-5 times now and have always received good service, always enjoyed my food and was satisfied with the size of the meal. It's a really good spot to stop at for a quick and delicious Diner style breakfast. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Nicks II is a great GREEKrestaurant.  The menus is extensive and varied. The Gyro sandwich (with choice of delicious soups of the day, cole slaw, or French Fries\" was excellent. The pita was fluffy and fresh and the sauce with the gyro meet was tasty.  My partner got the omelett with French Toast and potatoes, another tasty dish.

Their \"frequent diner card\" gives a $6 discount after 6 visits.

Friday Fish Fry looks intersting.

Don't get this confused with Nick's on Reems, We went to the Reems Nick's but saw it was \"biker friendly\" and the menu didn't look Greek at all."}
{"text":"Well, here it is 2 years later and we've eaten here dozens of times.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Have now eaten here a number of times. Although the décor is typical small diner the food and prices more than makes up for the deficiency.  The wait staff is exceptional. Best fried fish I have ever had West of the Mississippi. Breakfasts are fantastic! The gyro sandwich is on a par with other gyros but the tzatziki sauce is excellent. Looking forward to trying the braised lamb shank. This has become my new Friday night dining routine."}
{"text":"Gyro no onions with feta of course. Drove across town to try the new one. Bigger than #1, same food thankfully."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast around 9 am (Saturday), it was busy but we were seated promptly. The food was decent and was served quickly with a smile. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a really great little breakfast place. I used to frequent the original nicks that was a block from my house, I'm not sure if it's still open since I've moved, but I'm sure it's going strong as popular as it was. Now I've found this new Nicks II and it's the same greatness in a bigger location. I love that I can get a huge breakfast for a low price, and it's not just quantity, it's also quality."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and the service is always great. The new site is big and beautiful"}
{"text":"Always great choice for breakfast lunch or dinner! We have enjoyed the all you can eat fish and chips many Fridays!"}
{"text":"Happened upon Nicks diner after deciding NOT to eat at the BBQ restaurant attached to Wildlife World Zoo Aquarium and Safari Park .  Figured a diner would appease everyone's palate.  My daughter had a bacon cheeseburger, I tried it and it is a solid burger, meat was not dry, it would be what I order if we make it back there.  Mom had liver and onions  I cannot personally comment on the taste but she said it was delicious.  The organ was flavorful, onions tender and the mashed potatoes it came with were good (I did try those) the certainly were not boxed mashed potatoes, not too airy but also not too dense.  They were buttery and seasoned well enough that the well seasoned gravy complimented the mashed.  I had a very boring salmon salad. Lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber...salmon.  My mother's entree came with soup...out if her options she chose the chicken pot pie soup (EAT THIS!) soooo good, we ended up ordering another bowl (since we ate all of hers) AND took 3 orders to go.  The only thing that could have made this soup better is if there were dumplings in it.  They have daily specials and the day we went happened to be free slice of pie day.  I was happily surprised by the cherry pies sweet and tart fruit and compote cradled by a buttery flaky crust.  Would like to go back for all you can eat fish fryday."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly, breakfast reasonable and good. Nice ambience for a diner and not noisy. Give it a try."}
{"text":"We liked this place, big portions and good food. My husband got a club, I got chicken parm and our girls got chicken tenders. Everything we ordered was good. I especially liked the chicken parm! The owner even came out to our table to say hello. Love supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"If you want a deal on breakfast: eggs, bacon, toast, etc. go Monday- Friday 7-11.  $5 for breakfast is not a bad deal.  Wish I would of known before I dropped $20 for a Nick's Omelet, a glass of OJ, and some pancakes and bacon.  

I did proudly demolish both dishes and can say I am a fan of the Nick's omelet. I would go back for the omelet.  The potatoes were good and a nice filler with the plate.  I can say I was a fan of the pancakes, on the large side and will fill you up.  The bacon, I was hoping would be crispy, but more on the soggy side during my sampling.  

If you are looking for a fresh, home style plate of breakfast this is my local joint.  Yes I could cook up most of the stuff, but it is nice to enjoy a melted cheese omelet with a nice mix of ingredients cooked by someone else sometimes :)

Staff was friendly and I enjoyed my breakfast there.  I would most likely go again, by myself since I am the only fan of breakfast in my household :)  

Thanks Nicks Diner for a great breakfast, nothing like breakfast like mom makes it.  Yes it did bring me back to breakfast when I was a kid...My mom used to cook breakfast like this all the time.  Ahh, memories."}
{"text":"It's Sunday and I finally got to try the giant cinnamon roll. It is giant it could use more filling little bit more frosting but it still is awesome"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while. First time here since they moved across the street. New store is definitely nicer and up to date. They have a full bar here, too. Staff is very nice and quick. The food is tasty, omelets and pita sandwiches are great here, salads are average, Philly cheesesteak is my favorite sandwich here, and the pancakes taste pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and had the corn beef hash plate.  Came with sliced corned beef, which I was fond of, not the spam style stuff.  Food came out fast and the owner regularly stepped out of the kitchen to check with customers on how the food was, which was nice to see."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! The owner is super hands on and it shows. Busing tables, sitting people and cooking. Quick service and food turnaround"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast sandwich. Good coffee. Small restaurant it got seating quickly on a Sunday. I'm from KCMO and I would recommend this place to anyone. French Toast was amazing."}
{"text":"This was a great find!  The service was top notch!  The ladies were all very very friendly, the coffee was good and the food was fast and tasted great!  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We tried Nick's II over the weekend. The breakfast is pretty good! The best part of the meal was the pancakes. They were so light and fluffy! The biscuits and gravy and corned beef hash were a little bland. The french toast was pretty good. The coffee was great - not your standard diner coffee. The prices were very reasonable for the large portions. I would love to come back and try their gyros!"}
{"text":"Get ready to eat a lot of food.  You get a ton.  I had the chicken fried steak breakfast with 2 eggs, toast and home fries.  Very tasty meal.  The breakfast sausage they use is huge (like hot dog big). Service was fast and food came out fresh and hot.  They could use bigger cups.  We did wait for refills but with meals that large and drinks that small they tend to go down fast."}
{"text":"AWESOME place for B'Fast and/or Lunch!!! Roomy inside! Can accommodate large groups! The food is top shelf, the portions are very generous and a great value. I live 30 miles away and will make this a regular stop..its that good!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch this place is jammed, with huge portions and really some of the cheapest prices around I can see why.  We had the monster size Denver omelette, an ok version of the Greek chicken rice soup more like porridge than any version I've had.  The French toast looked good but was eh, however the dolmades with sausage was a real winner served with a sweeter than usual lemon sauce, rice on the side was a nice touch."}
{"text":"A great independent restaurant in the sea of franchises! Food is good and prices are awesome!!! The owner Nik even comes out to talk to customers and ask how their dining experience was. Highly recommended if you're looking for good food at an even better price"}
{"text":"Disappointed. I was expecting more from this place after reading other reviews. Ordered the country skillet. Very bland with little pieces of sausage. My husband had cheeseburger and fries. Basic burger with dried out fries. For the price could of went somewhere else with way better food. Uhg"}
{"text":"Although I love Nick's diner, it's clearly going downhill. The last two times we were in for breakfast, the food was very disappointing. 

Yesterday I ordered the breakfast special number 14, eggs over medium with porkchops. The eggs, while looking over medium, turned out to be runny to the extent where they were still raw. The porkchops, which I've had before and were wonderful, tasted like somebody marinated them in a salt brine for days! 

It is extremely rare that I don't finish my breakfast, but this was so awful I left most of it on the plate and took one porkchop home for my cat! 

The service and ambience is still great at this neighbor diner, but clearly someone else has been doing the cooking during our last two visits. I don't think will be going back anytime soon or at least until we see them advertise for a new breakfast cook!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time on a late Saturday morning. It was busy and didn't seem like it was slowing down any time soon. We didn't wait too long to be seated considering the crowd. Food was fantastic, service was great and most importantly it didn't break the bank. Would definitely make the drive to have breakfast there again!"}
{"text":"They have an outstanding breakfast menu. Lots of choices and combinations to had for sure. However, if you are a sucker for French toast and you hate cake. Stay away! The texture is very soft, too soft. It tastes almost exactly like cake. You get a large portion sure, but the experience isn't great. A quantity over quality place for sure. That's only on the breakfast side though, they've got great presentation and service. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"great food, the fried zucchini is a must! we have had many meals here and they are always good and fresh. Great go to diner."}
{"text":"Great \"old school\" family dining.
Wonderful place to take company on your dime.
Top shelf food"}
{"text":"I was not really excited when may parents told me to meet them here  for lunch.  However I got there before my parents ....the hostess set  up the perfect table with wheelchair access.  The service was fantastic Such a variety of food choices on the menu. My mom and uncle had liver and onions.  Not my choice but they thought it was fantastic.   I would definitely come back it's a great place when you have a large group."}
{"text":"We wanted a break from Denny's and the normal routine breakfast places, hoping this would be different. It was not. Service staff was friendly and quick, no issues with that, price was fair as well. Food was mediocre at best, the bacon looked like the cheapest one you can buy at the grocery or store... Or maybe it was the \"ready to eat\" pre-cooked bacon, not sure. But it was not good. The strawberries were not fresh, the \"country fries\" are thin potato slices that have no seasoning or flavor, had to pour a bunch of salt on them just to make them not taste like a plain sliced potato. The price was cheap so I guess you cannot expect much, I would pay more for better quality food though."}
{"text":"Was looking for a neighborhood style restaurant and checked this place out.  Very friendly staff and attentive.  We ordered lunch.  Food from the grill was fresh.  The other dish was clearly microwaved as half of the food was cold.  Frozen vegetables.  Not pleasing at all.  
Perhaps breakfast would be a better choice."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that the food was delicious and we ordered a lot of it! The customer svc. left a lot to be desired. They were not crowded yet we were sat near the back corner and served last. The water had a funny unsettling taste making it hard to return."}
{"text":"This place is close to home. The food is good and service is great. Get here early because it gets packed quick. I'm a breakfast person and this place never dissapoints. Everything is made from scratch and portions are huge."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. My wife and I went in on a Thursday night about 6. We both ordered breakfast. Less then 5 minutes later, both meals, surprisingly were on the table. I'm fairly certain that either they are truly the worlds fastest cooks on earth, or most of it was precooked and sitting in buckets on a counter. I'm going to go with the second. Freshly cooked, is my guess, not much of a priority."}
{"text":"We travel from wickenburg for their food. Love the gyros and their lemon chicken orzo soup. Always leave full"}
{"text":"Wow!!! I found this restaurant on Yelp and it deserves every star. I had the lemon chicken soup which was fantastic-not creamy just flavorful. The spanakopita was flaky and full of savory onions and spinach. I added mashed potatoes and gravy because that is my go to in judging a restaurant and they did not disappoint. My husband had the Country Skillet and said it was, \"excellent.\"  Our server was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Try this place-you'll like it!!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the breakfast we had only.  I was sorely disappointed in coming here.  I had the biscuits and gravy which was acceptable nothing special.  The part I was most disappointed in was the pancakes which had little to no flavor.  My fiance wasn't thrilled either.  I usually make buttermilk  pancakes from scratch and don't see how you can mess that up.  Also, the sticky syrup container on the table...that should tell you something.  I just think they should serve real maple syrup if you are going to be charging that much for a pancake like that.  Will not be returning and will stick to making my own pancakes or going to Butters in Scottsdale if I want a real treat out."}
{"text":"...look, i really like this place. Sometime it get a lil to crowded and the a/c doesn't always work right...... But worth it...... So, dont come here to eat. Go find your own place."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was here. I had a breakfast plate with eggs, home fries, bacon and biscuits and gravy. My husband ordered a burger. I'm very picky about gravy and it's hard to find. This sausage gravy was SO GOOD. It wasn't chalky and had good consistency and the sausage was peppered. My husbands burger was HUGE. And very good. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"A really great breakfast this morning at Nick's II on Litchfield Rd. just north of Waddell. Not too busy when we got there, but when we left there were about thirty people waiting in line! Great food, great service, reasonable price. Best breakfast in town!"}
{"text":"After the first time of trying them out we have been back almost every week. Everything we have tried is always good. Good Service, nice ambiance and fast food. It gets really busy so don't get discouraged; wait for it"}
