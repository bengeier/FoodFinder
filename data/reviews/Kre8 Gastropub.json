{"text":"Food was fantastic and it happens to be at my favorite brewery in Charlotte. Service for food needed a little help but bar service was great."}
{"text":"Love that this place is attached to Wooden Robot! Same great food you know and love! Definitely wait for a waitress, they come to you. It's a little confusing when you bring a beer from Wooden Robot but otherwise great! Wish they had more seating!"}
{"text":"I mean, solid for an afternoon snack. Not sure I could call this place a spot for lunch or dinner, but for those weekend bites when you don't eat on a normal schedule, give it a go!

A handful of gluten free options. Our server was really friendly.

Hummus was yummy and the mussels had good flavor."}
{"text":"I love that their menu has expanded and they have offerings within the wooden robot. They offer some interesting dishes and they are quite tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place & chef rob! Delish & innovative food in a relaxed setting. We will return again & again"}
{"text":"This shit was so good. We had cauliflower nugs while sucking down a couple beers from Wooden Robot. The BBQ sauce is something else and the waitstaff was great. Two thumbs way up baby!

Quick sauce rating BBQ better than Cayenne Sauce better than Pesto"}
{"text":"TL;DR - Good food to go along with a trip to Wooden Robot, but would not go just for the food.

I was torn between giving this place a 3 or 4, but when I was thinking, next time my wife and I are trying to figure our where to go to dinner near south end, would this be one of my suggestions?  Ultimately, the answer is no.

Food - 4/5 - The menu can be categorized as upscale pub food.  Most things on the menu have some type of unique twist that make them interesting.  The bao tacos are a unique addition which I appreciate.  My wife and I got the deep south bao (bbq pork), the funky monkey bao (banana/nutella dessert), and the tot 2.0.  The flavoring of both baos was fantastic.  I particularly liked how the pickle on the deep south bao complemented the sweetness of the pork.  My only nit is that the bao was a bit too dense and didn't have the same light sweetness that I get out of a normal bao (aka not fried).  The tot was also fantastic with the potato being nice and crispy and the arugula, okra, and pimento cheese having fantastic flavor.  

Ambience/Decor - 3/5 - It is literally in Wooden Robot and has that open warehousey type feel that is common with a lot of breweries.  Good amount of space to hang out and chat.

Service - 2/5 - I went in expecting it, but I still can't get on board with the process.  If you just sit at a table, I got the impression that no one was ever going to come ask for my order, even when I was clearly trying to make eye contact with every person with a kre8 shirt on.  I guess the strategy is you need to flag someone down.  If I truly need to flag someone down, I don't know why they don't just make me order at a window.  At least then I could get my order in quickly.  It's not a big deal, but when you're hungry, it'll quickly make you cranky.  Another minor complaint was having to pay and tip before I got my food.  This was a product of a shift-change, but still annoying, especially when I had already been waiting for my food for awhile.

Price - 2/5 - This may be what brings Kre8 down from a 4 to a 3.  If I had the option to buy a single bao for $3, I would pass based on the size and what I was getting.  Similarly for the tot.  It's fancy, but it's still just shredded potatoes with some topping, $11 was a bit steep.  It's a common trend now to go with the \"small plates\" theme.  I understand why the price needs to be higher (takes more labor to make each dish), but when I weigh what I got vs. what I paid, not the best.  

If you're already at wooden robot, it's definitely worth getting the food, but if you were just looking for a place for dinner, I would head elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Went to Kre8 on a whim with the purpose of trying something new. It's a seat yourself situation (or it was on a Sunday evening) but we had no issue getting a table. We ordered the Bosshog mac & cheese egg roll, the Deep South bao taco, and the Kre8 Cuban. The tacos come with 3, and they're delicious! The tiny pickles on top of the beer braised pulled pork with burnt bourbon mango Bbq sauce tucked in a fried bao bun,  packed w flavor, a little kick and the perfect size for a snack.  The Cuban was small, but in reality probably a normal serving size for an adult. It had more of the delicious pulled pork, some thinly shaved ham, some mustard, swiss and pickles. Oh and we had fries as a side that were tossed in Parm and drizzled with some type of sweet and spicy sauce. Yum. Last up, how can you go wrong with a large egg roll filled with Mac and cheese, bacon jam liquid cilantro? The answer is YOU CANT. We did try to make up for eating such a vegetable-less meal buy getting the blistered snow peas as a side. These little guys were perfectly charred and seasoned on the saltier size.  You don't want to go here if you're looking for a healthy meal (although they do have some pretty legit sounding salads on their specials menu), but you forget how unhealthy you're being as soon as you take the first bite. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Sat down, 15 minutes later no one had walked over to take our order. Walked up to the bar, asked if I could order food there, \"no\". Was told he would send a food runner to our table, 10 minutes later no food runner. We left.

OH and I saw a few food runners carrying food in one hand, and the bucket to put dirty dishes in the other hand, extremely gross. I loved the Twisted Eats food truck, but this service is horrible. I was so excited to go here only to leave severely disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"Have been super excited for this place to open since we first eat heard about it! It's awesome to have a place to eat within Wooden Robot to compliment their yummy beers. I can't say that the food here is super healthy, but it is certainly yummy and is the perfect thing after a beer or two to satisfy. 

We ordered the Mac and cheese egg rolls, some wings, and the fried cauliflower bites. Everything was deep fried, but it was amazing. The Mac and cheese was super creamy and had little pieces of bbq in it. The wings came with blue cheese or ranch as well as the usual celery and carrots. Very large wings and not overly sauced. The cauliflower was a little oily but very yummy and came with a variety of sauces that paired well. 

Service was a little slow but it was great experience overall. Plus, I love that they're dog friendly!"}
{"text":"Honestly cannot get over how AMAZING this place is!!! A bunch of us came together and basically tried everything on the menu, and not one of us had a bad thing to say about anything. I love the concept as well- go to the bar for your beer, and get a server for your food. They were extremely busy, but the quality of food was not effected. I would recommend everyone I know to come here!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying out this new concept after reading a lot about it leading up to the opening. 

I was honestly a little disappointed. There food was good, but not as good as I was expecting it to be. I got the chicken sandwich and fried cauliflower. The chicken sandwich was just ok. It was a little dry and kind of lacked flavor. The fried cauliflower was pretty good, but nothing that special. Two people at my table got the grilled cheese and thought it was just ok. They said it wasn't cheesy enough. The one thing that really stood out were the brussels sprouts. They were some of the best I've had. 

While the restaurant does have its own space, they will also serve you the full menu from the brewery which is really nice. 

If I was hungry while at the brewery, I would get food again, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come to the restaurant."}
