{"text":"Bamiyan kebab has the best kebab options period.  Their various chicken and beef kebabs are all amazing.  It's really good to go with a bunch of people that you can try all the kebabs.  Been to all their locations and the meat is always fresh and tasty and consistently good.  Their quality and freshness is definitely higher than some of the other kebab options in the area.  Highly recommended.  It's also great for people who are New to different ethnic foods as this is relatively mild and you can add as much spice as you want on the side as needed.  :)"}
{"text":"Great food..huge portions...the half chicken dinner is my fav! Barg kebob is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Really good kebabs! Doesn't matter what you order - beef, chicken, lamb, and whatever marinade - I haven't had a bad selection yet! Price is fair for the amount of food you get. I often take home some for lunch next day.   Two downsides - not enough seating during peak dinner time (doesn't matter what day you are going, it's busy all nights) and the lines are long."}
{"text":"I love the portion sizes, and the food in this place, it's pricey, but it's well worth it. One of the few places that can fill me up and sastify my hunger. I alway end up spending $20+ for Lunch ( main meal+drink+desert ) If you are a samm eater, you can split 1/2 plate for lunch and 1/2 for Dinner"}
{"text":"THe service was not the best.  The lady argued that we received the number for our order, when we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time.  The Salmon was bland.  The beef was flavourful.  We had asked for tap water.  We had to ask again.  The lady put the pitcher down and gave 3 cups without saying anything.  We will not come again."}
{"text":"4.5, I was recently in Canada and my friend took me to this place. The Rice was really good, I cant complain about the rice at all, im not really a rice guy but this place had some good RICE!   I ordered the chicken kabob, it was very flavorful. I dont have any complaints about this place whatsoever, its just that ive had better Kabobs in VA, so I really cant give it a 5. If this place was in VA, it woulda had a better following than 99% of the Kabob places here."}
{"text":"SUCH good afghan food. It gives me life.  Get any kabob and tandoori grill. It's like the perfect mix of Persian and Indian food."}
{"text":"Whatever mix of magic they put on their chicken... they deserve an award!  Forget the Colonel's 11 herbs and spices... this place makes the most delightfully tender marinated chicken kebabs i've ever tasted!  The place is soooo clean!  The food is simple but full of flavour!  I pre-order office lunches here for 50 people and ask them to package it up buffet style... everyone goes wild for it!    They have a small menu, the location is not the greatest... but it's worth the trip there!  The spicy dipping sauce that comes with the naan is also perfectly blended!  There's never enough for the naan, so I recommend getting an extra 2 or 3 with your meal!  If you go at lunch (between noon-1:30pm) be prepared for a long wait (totally worth it though!) and possibly a challenge to find seating.  Show up around 11:30/11:45 or mid afternoon and you'll generally find a seat.  Never would I have thought that an Afghan restaurant in a small strip mall would serve such awesome food!"}
{"text":"Heard good reviews about the place so I decided to try it. Called in to order takeout, the lady that answered had a hard time hearing or communicating; had to repeat order many times to confirm. I ordered the following  -sultani kabob dinner - found the barg kabob too hard and dry, flavour wasn't too strong either; the rice was soaked with the salad dressing and not so aromatic; naan is good -chicken breast kabob - the meat had more flavour than the dish mentioned above -Firnee - had this for dessert and really good, nice and creamy  Tip: The rice from one dinner is enough to share for two, maybe ask rice or salad in separate container"}
{"text":"The chicken is fantastic. Often visited this place in my former neighbourhood. You have to wait in line to order. It is usually a busy place. Parking is not always easy. Small plaza. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"solid food.  pretty fast service.   i had a chicken wrap.  tasty and good portion size for the price.  others with me had various meat kebob dinners.  rice was flavorful.  had some subtle spices that we couldn't quite pick out.  maybe cardamon.  regardless it was than just plain seasoned rice.  meat was well cooked and juicy.  their naan isn't like indian naan.  not really my thing but the salsa like condiment that came with it was delicious.  i also had the firnee which was quite good.    decor is nothing to write home about.  comparable to any other fast food place.  clean and comfortable.   seemed like a lot of customers were from the neighborhood.  that probably speaks well of the place.   overall a solid spot.  simple food that is well executed."}
{"text":"Big fan of their sultani kabob (barg and koobideh) and boulagnee.  I have had many Persian versions of the sultani kabob, and I believe this ranks near the top.  I never realized that their rice was cooked in beef broth...maybe that is why it is flippin' magical.  This place tends to get very busy so there are long lines and wait times but what do you expect when the food is so good...be patient.  This is always one of our goto spots."}
{"text":"Just as good as all the other locations. Bamiyan in Richmond Hill, gotta love it! Will go back time and time again. Very spacious and clean, much bigger than the Dixie location.  Half Chicken was delicious with tons of naan and hot sauce. If they added Wifi, it would be perfect."}
{"text":"Bamiyan is consistently good. Can't go wrong if you are in the mood for some Afghan grill meat.  Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Consistent quality and the seasoning is spot on. Beats all other similar Afghani grill outlet within a 25 km radius hands down."}
{"text":"So been to the one in Markham and now the one near York U and both locations are pretty busy.  Have to say the food is pretty good.  It took awhile, but well worth the wait.  I actually waited longer than it took me to eat this time. Lol  Got the chicken kebob and it was like a Greek kebob but with different seasoning.  The portions here are terrific, no complaints at all.  The nan bread you get with dinner combo is amazing!  Nice and warm when fresh.   Price wise, just like any Greek dinner, you are looking at $11/plate.     Will i come back... yes."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a while and I love the food. I've had the kofta wrap (under $5- what a steal!) and also the lamb dinner. Honestly I have nothing bad to say. The food is delish, the place is clean and the people are great. If you don't like anything about the meal just ask them and they will try to rectify. It can get busy over the weekends, but now you can also order over the phone.  Love it!"}
{"text":"We had heard about this place from one of our friends..and frankly we loved every bite we took..we had ordered the kofta kabob and chicken breast kabob platters...the platters came with afghani naan which is the best I have ever eaten....a must try for anyone who is a foodie!!!"}
{"text":"This place was very clean. The food was amazing. I ordered the choppon kabob meal, it's lamb chops with amazing Spices, it also comes with rice and salad. Highly recommend it.."}
{"text":"This is the location across from York university and this would be my second time visiting this location, simply because it's super far from downtown. Anyways, for about $13 I was super satisfied with my meal. I got my kabab (no rice; salad only), 2 naans (I had to take one home with me) and a pop drink. The food came out within 15 mins and our group was able to dig in and enjoy the meal on a Tuesday evening. The meat was tender and seasoned well and a treat for the palette. One thing I enjoy about Bamiyan is their commitment to quality regardless of location.   Will return."}
{"text":"I love bmiyan kabobs, I have been in all bmiyan kabobs in GTA.. Never had any problem with food but I have to admit my last visit which was tonight.. I experienced McDonalds kind of service...bad customer service lack of professionalism.   I ordered my food for 2, after a I paid the cashier Asked me to have a sit and she will let me know when my food is ready!!! For last 9 years been to bamiyan was first time been asked to have a sit...!!!  Anyway after 15 minute I got my food and again the cashier asked me to have a sit and they will bring the bread,,, after I started eating my food ..10 minutes later my wife went back to her and asked her about bread she replied ; sorry, our bread maker is just to slow today and we can't. Do nothing about it.... But the bread will be ready in 5. Minutes. My wife came back to the table and she said bread will be ready in 5 minutes. 10 min past,I just couldn't hold my frustrations Amy more I went back to the cashier and I asked her the following   Did I paid my food in full $ amount? She said Yes, So how dose it feels to order a hamburger without the bread? She said you right it is unacceptable.   After I finished my food, she came with 2 pcs of bread in a bascket and she said; we are sorry and she left.   This is not all wait.  She came back and she added on more bread and she said this is for free.....!!!!!!  That was the end for me.... Lack of communication and customer service.   That was my thanksgiving dinner story."}
{"text":"Stopped going to this place for about a year because the service was deplorable.  Decided to go back today and the service changed...it's much worse now.  You need to clean your own table if you are deciding to dine in.  When you ask them for a napkin to clean the table they are more then happy to give you one and I mean only one piece.  Tell them its to do their job and they might give you 2 pieces.  Anyhoo, lets get straight to the food.  It is really good especially the half chicken Tandoori without rice.  If you get rice they charge you an extra $2.00 and that's not worth it.  I don't think I will be going back anytime soon as their are more Afghan food places that have opened up in the area.  No matter what you order on the menu is sure to be tasty.  Just remember one thing....The service is crap!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Perfect portions. Fast service. Clean restaurants and washrooms. One of our family's go to place. Glad they opened this one near Hwy 7 & 404.   Good for family. Chicken breast kabob with naan is my 4yr old's fav."}
{"text":"Food is good and delicious, staffs are helpful and friendly.. I've been going there for a while and not even one time run into difficulties. If you haven't been there; I recommend you to go and try their kofta kebab-cheap and tasty."}
{"text":"very homely and friendly place! you can definitely feel that its not a western place. the food was amazing. it was very well seasoned and tasted great. we were pretty much done in less than 5 minutes on a full stomach so you get the image. the meals are big and the dinners include meat, rice and 2 different salads (+2 different dips). we got 2 for 4 people and were absolutely full. they also give a small freshly-baked bread with each meal which was super tasty. the staff were friendly as well. the prices were a bit high but compared to what you get it seems reasonable. would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS busy!  The food is super filling and scrumptious. (Finding seating is sometimes a challenge but worth the wait)"}
{"text":"I frequent this place for the past 2-3 years.  It seems they have changed the quality and taste of the food.  Both the meat, rice and sauces are different.  Maybe cost cutting because of the rise in food prices?   I hope they go back to how things were."}
{"text":"The tandoori chicken is magical. I am not sure how else to describe it. Using any other adjectives would not do it justice. I order this every time despite not being partial to chicken. Fortunately, I have never come here alone, so I have been able to try items on the menu other than the tandoori chicken.   Everything that I have tried here is tasty, except for maybe that free red sauce that everyone raves about... though it is not a menu item so I will discount it. The chaplee is really nicely spiced and is another favourite. Kabobs either come alone (but not really, because it comes with naan and a salad) or as a dinner set. The only difference is that the dinner set comes with rice, and costs $2 more. The salad (lettuce, diced onions and tomatoes) and rice are nothing special, so I usually don't order the dinner. The naan, on the other hand, is always served fresh and warm, if not hot.   The mango smoothies look delicious, and I have seen many patrons with one, but I'm always too full to try!    This location is very clean and spacious -- much more so than the Overlea one. It doesn't feel very much like a food court and I've never had trouble with service at the counter. In fact, I enjoy how chill it is, and thoroughly enjoy being able to just grab all my food once my name is called, then sit back and enjoy in a fairly nice environment."}
{"text":"Horrible service, and employees. They disregard orders done on the phone, I ordered on the phone 1 hour prior to me coming in and got the order an hour after I came in. I wouldn't recommend this place based on service, because they will let you down. Never coming back !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bamiyan Kabob - been there a few times and as you can tell by the name - its a Kabob place lol.    They have many different types of kabobs - I always thought there was just a few type of kabobs you can get - but they have chicken, half chicken, tandoori, lamb,  etc kabob.  So there is lots of selection.  The food is served with rice, salad, naan and chutney, or you can choose some other sides. The kabobs are juicy and tender the food just tastes really good.  I think if you are going to try kabobs - then you might as well eat at place that specializes in kabobs.  One slight downside is that this place is packed during lunches and you have to wait for your food - but who cares.  Also if you are planning on eating here, instead of getting pop or the usual, try a lassi - its really good."}
{"text":"Knocking 2 stars off for service. If you know its a busy time (maybe weekend or Friday night) DO NOT get takeout especially a large takeout order. Have had to wait over an hour AND find out they got my order wrong when it was too late to go back on multiple occasions!! Save yourself the hassle"}
{"text":"Most delicious and succulent tandoori chicken you can get in the East end. The rice has as great light flavour to it as well. Comes with salad and bread."}
{"text":"Tried Toodri Chicken Dinner for lunch.  Taste, Smell and Colour really good.  Rice's texture is just right for Mid-east kind of rice.  Big portion of Rice and Salad and probably too much for lunch.  Price I would say it is reasonable with the quality and portion.  It is self serve and order in the front.  Speed is not too bad.  Wait around 10min.  Not crowded to sit in but got quite a lot of people there."}
{"text":"First time and it was exelent food and great people that they even give me food of their plate !"}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype around this place. Bamiyan is known for it's chapli kababs, and I'll be honest, they're pretty good. However, the prices are sky-high for just a few pieces of meat and subpar rice on a piece of lettuce. After eating a variety of their stuff, I found that everything tastes pretty similar (not that that's a bad thing..). I wish that they gave us plates and cutlery instead of having to ask for every little thing. All in all, it's nice to enjoy some authentic Afghan cuisine, and I'll probably end up coming again because everyone loves it so much."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Only tried the wraps so far. Can't wait to go through the menu"}
{"text":"Reliably good. This city knows about Afghan food now, it's been a great contribution to our multicultural mix of cuisines. The Bamiyan chain is one of the pioneers. Try the firnee. Always fun to watch the strip mall parking lot as the cars of York U students get ticketed"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for 3 years since I discovered this place. I come here at least twice a week. This place seems to be always busy especially around dinner times and the wait could be long. The customer service could be bad at times but is generally good especially with those new girls. The reason I am giving this restaurant 5 stars despite its down side is because the food is amazing. The portion is big enough that you may not be able to finish it. You cannot compare kebabs from here to some lousy places'. Strongly recommend this place for those who want to try great food with decent price."}
{"text":"Really busy place. Open late.  Tandoori chicken is awesome..  Good amount of food.  Been there many times."}
{"text":"I had high hopes from this place after reading wonderful reviews, but in was a big disappointment. To start wid the naan's was too dry. When I compare its tastes and flavones to Afgan restaurant in the same strip plaza, I found there food much better"}
{"text":"So delicious! We were visiting Toronto from Texas and used Yelp to find this place.  The portions and flavors were great!. Try the Mango Smoothie if it's available. Plain and simple.. it's a must try :)"}
{"text":"Food is good but lowest customer service quality you could ever receive from many employees in there .. Cheap quality .."}
{"text":"This was very nice experience... The food was great and the price was OK. Me and misses went on a Saturday night about seven o'clock, the place was packed... We were going to get some takeout chicken at the place a few doors away but instead sat in for a kabob dinner. It took a few minutes to get our food and without question every second we waited was worth it. There is no table service... You order, then grab a place to sit. Family friendly and clean as a whistle..."}
{"text":"An excellent, excellent kebab.  If well-spiced, grilled meats and fresh, exuberant flavors are your idea of gourmandise, Bamiyan will make you happy - for $8-13 a plate.  This is a simple café in a nondescript mall with bare tables and no table service; pay at the counter, take your number and wait.  In my case, 20-25 minutes on a busy Sunday evening (I got takeaway, finding a free table would have been tough).  It's not fast fast food, so be forewarned if you're on a tight lunch break.  But your reward for waiting is authentic food, cooked with pride and care.  Sometimes simplest is best. I ordered my litmus test: grilled chicken breast kebab, hoping all the while they would do something nice with a meat that is so often dry and overcooked.  And bingo: tender and beautifully spiced meat, with a simple side salad (lightly dressed with cilantro for a little fragrance) and nice Afghan nan bread to complete that simple formula of meat, fire and bread that makes everything alright.  Looking forward to trying Choppan (lamb chops) and Kabilee Rice next time the craving hits. Which will be soon..."}
{"text":"The Kofta Kabob is a savoury dish of well grilled meat nicely seasoned on top of tender rice I recommend for the newbies of Afghani food. It took a bit of time for them to prepare our meal but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"No one does it better than BAMIYAN when it comes to traditional Afghani food! Fresh made to order with a very simple menu. This location is the original that started it all. It is always packed. Their basmati rice is simply one the best I ever tasted. I highly recommend Bamiyan especially this location since you get to experience the food along with the wonderful people that live in this area.   My fave dish: chicken tandoori dinner"}
{"text":"Went here with my fellow work mates after hearing about this place. Very conveniently located next to York university. I was a bit skeptical going in as I was never introduced to the afghani cuisine !!! WHERE WAS I THIS WHOLE TIME !!!! Wonderful meals and at a decent price. It's a little on the higher side but I don't mind spending a little extra on a great meal. We all ordered the Tandoori Chicken dinners and the portions are huge !!! We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals . The chicken was well spiced and succulent. The naan bread is to die for !! Freshly baked. The red sauce they make is a beautiful union of spice and tanginess. You can just dip your naan in it as a meal in itself.  The meal was such a hit that we ended up going back within the week !!!"}
{"text":"Nice place and good food. Meat is tender and juicy and the price is reasonable considering the menu. Will highly recommend. Like this place"}
{"text":"This place does not have a comprehensive menu. For example, no mantoo, curries, soups, borani and the kabuli Palau doesn't have the yummy leg of lamb. It is more of a take out or fancy afghan diner.   I've been here a few times and the food has never been bad. The place is always jam packed, service at the counter is not the best but expected. You take your tray of food once it's ready and if you're lucky find a table with left over food bits from previous customers.   The naan they serve is one of the best I've ever had. The servings are huge, and the food delicious. They mainly have a variety of kababs. The bolani is nice and spicy too. I appreciate that the prices are very reasonable. Makes the negatives cancel out bringing this place to the top."}
{"text":"Excellent quality with a large portion of food. Very healthy, flavourful with a nice interior. Strongly recommend the resturant."}
{"text":"Great place.  Family oriented with order at front layout.  I believe this is the best location of Bamiyan.  The food is always good, the firni is excellent.  My tip:  get the meat only skewers, rice, and naan separately - its cheaper, you can fine tune the amount of pieces of each (lambchop vs barg vs kabob) and are you really going to Bamiyan for a salad?! No!"}
{"text":"The best chicken kabob and kofta kabob in Toronto. Succulent, juicy and well cooked and flavourful kabob. Comes with a generous serving of afghan naan, plus brown, basmati rice, depending on how your order. The side salad is also delicious. I go there for my bi-monthly red meat fix and or occasional chicken kabob craving. The place is always, packed and busy."}
{"text":"Low rating for lack of speed at the counter at any time of day, I've probably had this a handful of times and the protein is more hit than miss but as I keep spending my money here I realize that I'm mostly paying for rice and salad.  These guys lost my business and the only time I'll eat this again is if someone else wants to buy and bring it over, I'll be sure I have a couple of steaks on my BBQ for protein to go along with the rice and salad."}
{"text":"Depending on the time of day you come here, you will feel the atmosphere is different. They seem to keep their best cooks available during busy time [ofcourse], other times when is a less busy, the food is usually not at par. Nevertheless ot is good enough to get 4 stars for keeping a consistent service style."}
{"text":"This is not a sit down. Its a pure play Afgani fast food Joint. The place is super busy - people just do not stop coming in. Be it for take out or eat in. The ambiance is not charming - A picture of the mountain range, another of Bamiyan Buddha's and the picture of a lil girl with blue green eyes which is now the poster child of afganistan - the food however tries makes up for it a little.   We had Choppan, Chaplee and Chicken kebabs.  Each dish comes with Nan and Salad(tomatoes, lettuce topped with garlicy mayo dressing). The nan's are good so are the meats - tender, juicy and succulent. The chicken is just ok.  It would be better if these guys offer a kebab platter no rice no salad.  Another thing to try for the curious cases is something called the 'Firni' - A rice pudding which is not all that bad. Actually its the only place where I have had 'Firni' just the way its supposed to taste like i.e. w/o any graininess of the rice. However the one served here is a over sweet.  Last thing - DO NOT wear green t shirt here else you'll be asked by someone to clean the table like I was :-)"}
{"text":"Great authentic Afghani food! Try anything off the menu and it won't disappoint! The spicy tomato sauce they include with every meal is great. The salad and sauce are so tasty.   Kabulee rice, I could just eat that all day with nothing else if I didn't care about consuming only carbs haha :P  Half chicken, chicken tandoori, sultani kebab, really can't go wrong with any of it. All of the meat is grilled well and flavorful.   For dessert, definitely try the firnee!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Love this place. Recommend the Chappan platter. The naan is so fresh."}
{"text":"The first time I tried eating here it really was a leap of faith as me and my friend were in the area and starving. Ever since then I have been a regular and have always been extremely satisfied.  The interior is somewhat basic but adequate. You place an order , receive a number and then collect your food in 10 or so minutes when it is called. I must point out that wait times can be longer at times depending on how busy they are so be sure to account for that.  The half chicken dinner is my favorite personally as I love the spices and flavor.  All meals come with a well done salad and naan which I'm not too particularly fond of myself. There is also a small container of salsa and the option of rice.  There is also choices of lamb and different cuts of beef kebabs. In my opinion spend the extra dollar as you can taste the difference for the beef.  I recommend this place to anyone and am really glad I've discovered it as the food is awesome and good value as well."}
{"text":"Definitely the best and tastiest Kabob Dinners in GTA, i guess  But, not a good place to sit and eat your food... lots of kids around, crying :-(  Also, I don't like their queue/no system, (you are supposed to get your order no., after paying the money) I forgot get mine, and the beautiful lady messed up my order. So, I had to wait for long to get it corrected ;-)"}
{"text":"Awesome chicken. A bit overcooked. But the flavor was amazing. They give plenty of rice and salad. And the naan is perfect too. Not too oily and it is soft and fluffy.  I just have to go back and try the rest of the dishes from their menu next time I'm in TO.   And I have to thank my friend for bringing me here. I loved it!!"}
{"text":"I was there Friday night, it was full, couldn't find seat. I had to stand out and wait until I could fond one. There was one table on which people had piled up the left over and dirty dishes, but the staff was too busy to clean up. The table for leaving dirty dishes was also so full that it was about to spill to the floor when the staff came to clean it up, they could have cleaned the dirty table making room for another family to sit but choose to leave it as it is.  There is hardly space to bring in your baby stroller, the seating is placed so tight that hardly a person can walk through.  The food quality was good as usual though but regretted to decide to dine in instead of take"}
{"text":"These guys need to expand, everything is so onpoint only if they had more seats!!!! I had the chicken beef and with rice and salad, i cleared the whole plate even though I shouldnt have!!"}
{"text":"Great good. Great service. Only negative feedback is that they do no accept credit cards."}
{"text":"I continue to frequent this place on and off.  The food is amazing but the service is horrible. This is the most unfriendly staff I have ever met in my life.  Even though I have seen the staff come and go, they all have the same non existing personality which makes you feel like \"Why did you walk in to this restaurant and now I have to work\".  The food is good and at times amazing as long as they don't over cook the chicken which rarely ever happens.  My tip for you is to bring your own bottle water or drinks because the if your like me and drink a lot of water, don't count on them to give you nay tap water and their is no point to pay them for something you can bring with you.  Also, make sure to bring your own napkins as they only give you one napkin and you will have to use that to clean the table prior to eating your food as the last person / animal left it all dirty."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try Bamiyan Kabob for awhile now, and finally got the chance the other day.  I really don't know much about Afgan food, and wasn't quite sure what to order.  I stared at the menu for awhile, before finally deciding on chicken, and asked for help as to what to order.  I ended up with two different kabobs, but both chicken.  One was a ground chicken and the other chicken breast.  The food was delcious!  My meal came with a salad, salsa, and the best Afgan naan in the whole world!  I ate until I was completely stuffed and didn't leave a morsel of food behind.  I probably should not have eaten so much but it was delicious.  The naan was still warm and crispy on the outside.  The salsa was just enough spice, and tasted amazing.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Three of our family favourites are   Half tandoori chicken dinner Tandoori Kebab dinner Choppan Kebab (Lamb)  Each of the dishes are very moist, made fresh and are always high quality.  I have been to the Markham locations which have been slow in service but the Keele one has been great for many years.  I took people who have never eaten Afghanitani food here and they really enjoyed it a great deal.  One of the key things is that the food is made fresh to order and is never in a \"hot plate\" or sitting in a buffet tray waiting to be served.    I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The servings are MASSIVE! For me at least. The good thing also is that it taste really good. Definitely a tummy filler. Will go back next time but maybe for takeout only so I can share. Lol!"}
{"text":"The most delicious food for any food lover. My favorite dish is the Chiplee kabab.. Served with rice and salad.   Must go .. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at this place after hearing they had the best Afghan food in Toronto. That's a lot to live up to, but this place does it.   We had the Tikka Kabob (Beef Tenderloin) and Choppan Kabob (Lamb) Dinners and they were delicious. Both dinners had their meat perfectly cooked. I've been places where the meat is dry and tough to eat, but this place has it right. We also had their Mango Smoothie which was a great compliment to the meal! I would definitely go back and try their Sultani Dinner which is a combination of Filet Mignon and their Beef kabobs."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Afghan kabob place I've ever had.  The kabobs, naan, rice are awesome for a good price."}
{"text":"Almost impossible to get a place to sit here. It's a good looking restaurant but is always busy so we've just had take-away and brought the meals back home. People usually sit there in large groups so it's really tricky to find seating - in my personal experience it can be any day of the week! This can only mean that they must be doing something right!  And they are...  All kabob dishes are really good. My personal favourite however is a side dish that probably gets neglected often - the Boulagnee - Pan fried, stuffed with potato, green onion and herbs. It is SOOO good and you will feel enormously guilty after but so worth it. Have it with some mint chutney or even plain yogurt - so satisfying. Yes, sometimes it's okay to not have meat in every meal - at Bamiyan Kabob - yes, I see the irony."}
{"text":"Got lunch to go from Bamiyan Kabob today.  Just as the other reviews had noted, it was quite busy in there (always a good sign).  I got the Tandoori chicken kabob dinner.  Food was pretty good, I would def go back again for lunch."}
{"text":"An Afghani \"fast food\" joint.  It's been very busy every time I've gone.  And with good reason!  Everything is great and at a reasonable price.  I'm only sorry it took me so long to discover the place.  I tried it because of the review in yelp.  Thanks yelp!"}
{"text":"This is a great place, nice and clean, friendly staff, great food, and as a vegetarian, there 'veggie wrap' for $3.99+ tax is phenomenal and delicious!"}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5/5.  I only ever take out from this place, because dining in is frustrating. They don't have any wait staff, so it is a matter of placing your order at the counter, and waiting forever until your name is called. Honestly, sometimes it feels like they're herding cattle.  I usually get the Chicken Breast Kabab. It is gently marinated in fragrant spices, and has a lovely char-grilled flavour from the BBQ. Their Naan is equally delicious with a nice chew, and light texture.  The red and white dipping sauces that come with the meal are standout. The red one is acidic and spicy, and the white sauce is mellow and ranch-like. Make sure to specify that you need the sauces, because the staff sometimes disregard their importance and fail to put them in your bag.  I used to be a fan of their rice. That is until I figured out they cooked it in Beef Broth. I don't eat beef, and on a hunch called in one day to verify whether they did.   Super disappointed that they don't make this clear anywhere on their menu."}
{"text":"Nice, quick fast-food Afghani-style.   People vote with their feet. This place is always busy with sit down and take out customers.   Good dinner kabob deals, specifically beef and tandoori chicken.    Tasty Boulagnee."}
{"text":"Excellent food. You can't go wrong with the food.  Well  priced and great portions. The only negative thing, they don't serve the food to your table. You have to pick up your own food from the counter and sometimes the tables are not cleaned and you have to ask them to clean them. Great for a very casual dining. Totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Parking Plenty of free parking in this plaza however, given the number of restaurants it serves, you may have to find parking at a neighbouring lot.  Atmosphere The decor was modern (looked like it was recently renovated). Atmosphere was very pleasant. Everything was very clean including the restroom. YAY! Family friendly. There were a lot of little (behaving) kids when I was there.  Service The service was fantastic and the food was made quickly. Must ask for the white garlic sauce though...this is not surrendered without a request. Most like a fast food joint.  Food FABULOUS. The meat was moist and flavourful. The pilaf was fluffy and flavourful as well. Portions were fantastic. Left feeling satiated but not gross (like you would after a Mandarin buffet) although, I did have to give away some of the meat because there was so much. The bread was toasty on the outside and soft on the inside. The salad could use some work (some brown pieces) but, I was not there for the salad so, I did not care.  One of the better fast food kebab places that I have been to. The price is competitive ($12-15 for dinner entrees). Will certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Love their tandori chicken.  Must have some raisins and carrot on the rice. Awesome hot sauce. Always take about 5 of them. Lol. Huge size. It's awesome for family or friends to share as well. Service is ok. U gotta listen carefully for ur order number."}
{"text":"I've been here twice over the past year and have been impressed both times.  Its semi-fast food.  Where you line up and order/pay at the cash, then wait till they call your number to pick up your food at the counter.  Then seat yourself.  While there is plenty of seating, this place is packed for dinner on the weekends (not sure about other times).   The food is really fresh, the portions are huge, real plates/cutlery, they will give you a jug of water if you want.  I tasted the following: Chicken Tikka Kabob: moist, super flavourful chicken Sultani Kabob: a great choice since you get two types of meat (Barg Kabob and Kofta Kabob).  The Barg was really tender!! Firnee: a pudding dessert, quite good.  I cannot comment on the authenticity of the Afghan food.  But everyone eating here seemed to be of middle eastern decent... so that means its legit right??  that's what i'm going with..."}
{"text":"Love going here for lunch!  The service is a bit slow, but you pay for what you get.  Food is always fresh and made to order.  The hot sauce is bomb and so is the naan bread.  Chicken is tender and not dry, despite what other people have said.  The rice is cooked so well too.  I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Very good food. Keep going back often! Healthy too n great prices!!  Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.  All locations are good and busy. I think the best one if I had to pick up one is the Markham location.  You can afford to go there every weekend!"}
{"text":"Went: 6:15 pm Thu June 25 2015 Ordered: Tandoori Chicken Kabob and Tikka Kabob and pop Cost: incl. tax and tip $27 Comments: The Tandoori was very good. I probably would have preferred dark meat. My date loved the thick naan bread that came with it. Portion sizes are generous. The Tikka Kabob was excellent and filled with flavour. This is not a sit down restaurant. You order at the front. The seats on the booths stood out because they were lower than normal. Bottom line: I would definitely come back. The prices are very reasonable and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"I don't know if my previous review is here or if they are allowing multiple reviews of the same venue. I think they should.  I cam here with my book club in April. I am entering all my book club location into yelp but have to do a lot of this by memory.  Everyone enjoyed their food, the customer service, the decor, etc.  I've been here once before and it was great that time as well. My average wating is a B- or B but this place is above average.  4.0 stars"}
{"text":"How do I say this nicely... shitty.  Horrible service, horrible patrons, and horrible food.  Eek.  The meats have a funny flavour to it.. rice is worse than Minute Rice.. salad is basically a garnish.  I visited this place based on BlogTO recommendation but what a huge let down.   (maybe because I am an infidel?)"}
{"text":"This is by far the best afghani food you'll find in north America. Whenever i come to Canada, and i come here a lot, i always eat Bamyan. Doesn't matter which branch you go to in GTA, it is always a great experience. I always order sultani dinner which is great but if you are a party of couple or more eating, one order dinner because it has enough rice and other can go without rice and you'll have enough to eat."}
{"text":"love this place for their kebabs and tandoori chicken. the portions are generous, and the food is so tasty.  The meats are really well seasoned and most importantly, not dry. Even the rice is good. It reminds me a bit of biryani (thought I'm sure that's not the correct way to refer to it) but it is definitely not bland.   I wouldn't say that the prices are cheap (about $10-14 for a dinner plate) and the place can get really busy."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location since 2002 when it first opened, and it is consistently delicious and affordable. I actually crave it at random. It's hands-down my favourite restaurant in the city.  I recommend the chicken breast kabob - tender, juicy, and flavourful. A close second is the Tandoori chicken kabob. Portions are massive, and everything is made to perfection .  Don't be put off by people's reviews of the service. There is no service - you basically order, pick it up when they call your number, and enjoy. Also, they cook in an open kitchen so leave your jacket in the car (if you came in one) - the delicious aroma sticks to your clothes for a long time.  If you are in doubt, go! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"A heaven for meat lovers. The place is small and a challenge to find a place to sit but the food is simply delicious.   I would highly recommend their kababs and a bread coked with potato based filling called bolani.."}
{"text":"All the meat served are fresh, delicious & definitely well prepared. With the kabob diners, you get a big soft naan bread and a small cup of chilli chutney. I have been eating in and around Toronto for last 3 years, this is one of my favorite places to go."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times since I work in the area. It's pretty standard, nothing really special. Would not recommend the Bamiyan Wraps though... They skimp on the meat and it ends up being 90% vegetables.  Kofta Bamiyan Dinner + the naan (3/5): I'll break it down like this: 50% rice, 30% salad, 20% meat. The salad and basmati rice are standard. Their meat is hit and miss though. Some pieces will be juicy, other parts will be dry. I found I had to couple some meat pieces with the salad to give it some moisture. Also since there is ALOT of rice, come here hungry or don't order the meal with rice. The naan is tasty though! Great to eat alone throughout the meal and served up fresh from the oven for the meal :)  Cost (3/5): Hmmm $10-$13+tax for a meal. It's not breaking the bank, but I've had better meals at this price point.  Service (3/5): Depending on how many people there you might have to wait awhile. It's fast food style so can't say much here.  Ambiance(3/5): It's more a fast food place, but it's got a decent seating area. Nothing special here. Like yelp puts it, \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Chicken Breast Kabob wrap reasonably priced at 5.29 Delivers a franchise experience - granite counters an brown orange colored decor throughout. taste is consistent to 2 other locations I've been to (brampton and markham)  The chicken kabob was very tender. Parking is a pain but I lucked out and got the last remaining space. This is likely due to it being in a plaza across from York University plus this plaza has so many food establishments contained within it.   Wait time was reasonable under 8 mins.  Only place where I see many people order dinner portions for lunch or takeout. some leave with bags with several take out containers.  Spicy is truly spicy so expect it :)  Great to see them expanding here. Used to frequent the Markham location. This is there latest location opened to my reviews writing."}
{"text":"always consistently fresh and tasty. have ordered the grilled chicken, kofta, beef kababs from various visits. just love the spices they put on meat. kind of citrus like.  bread (like a naan) is baked fresh, the tomato dipping sauce is to die for (spicy and yet cooling)..  the only experience i've had afgani food is at bamiyan. but having such good food here, i don't need to venture anywhere else.  be warned this place gets packed on the weekends!"}
{"text":"My rating heavily represents the food. It was always the best afghan food in the city and will continue to top my list in this category (along with naan & kabob ofcourse!). Their chicken and meats are very tender,their rice and naan breads are like eating love. I'm telling you if love was a food....it would be a fresh naan bread from bamiyan  (but I'm based because I love bread in general!)  The store is relatively clean, but since it's so busy we often are lucky to find a table and have to ask someone to wipe it down for us. It is also very large unlike the original location on overlea which is why I prefer coming here. Their washrooms could be cleaner but with the amount of traffic in the store I guess I don't blame them.  Food is consistent and on par ALWAYS and this is key.  They lose one star for their speed of service. They're not terribly slow but when it's busy be ready to wait for 20 minutes for your food. Like I said, not horrible but if you're hungry 20 minutes can seem like forever. Also, as I mentioned before, if it's busy, good luck finding a decent table!  Overall, the amount of people flocking is proof of just how good their food is :)"}
{"text":"The establishment was full when placing my order late afternoon over the weekend.  The restaurant has a fair amount of tables and diners remained standing until seats became available.  Good tasting kebabs with a buzzing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I've been coming here for over 4 years probably. Just see my tips and photo contribution to this place as proof.   I'm writing this review because I've noticed a trend. The trend indicates to me that this place is thinking too highly of themselves now and have clearly been cutting corners.   First is price. It seems like every time I come here the cost to my usual meal goes up by $0.25. I'm fine with that but my problem is the quality has clearly gone down. The meat isn't cooked as well anymore but I'm sure many people won't notice because it's so heavily season (the combination of spices is still wonderful) and people sometimes will use a lot of hot sauce. I remember it used to take a LONG time to get my meal because grilling meat to order will take a long time -- I'm fine with that. Now, the order flies out. Once, I ordered, went to the bathroom, came back and my order was already waiting (huh?). Other times the meat doesn't look like it's had enough go time on the grill because of the colour but the meat would be fully cooked and tough. This indicates some pre-cooking is being done.   The customer service is getting down right rude, I have noticed. Never with me though; I'm not picky and I don't request anything special, but I have seen it to others.   The greediness of the owner is definitely showing. Prior, you were able to get as many hot sauces as you like -- I once saw someone had 9 with their meal! (Y) I usually need two, which they've never refused me but I've noticed the last few times I've been here they've refused it to customers or they will be charged for it. Really?! Just now, as I'm writing this, someone got told that he wasn't allowed to have the \"white sauce\" (one used for salad) because he didn't order salad. The customer whispered a response that was presumably asking when they started doing this and the employee responded with last week. She gave him the sauce anyways and gave him a warning.   The rice and naan are still good. Nothing has changed there. Hard to screw with that though.   I've been coming here less frequently and I think that trend will continue."}
{"text":"This was my first time here after nearly living nearby one year.  It was so fresh and tasty ... Love the rice but couldn't eat it all.  Can't wait to try a couple more dishes.  Firnee was also yummy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a healthy and fresh meal, this is the place to go. The portions are huge but a friend and I always share the dinner plate. We get the chicken breast dinner which comes with rice, salad, bread, tangy sauce and we add another skewer of chicken (usually tandoori chicken). The total comes up-to around $20 but leaves us satisfied and full. If you're doing take out or even dine in always call ahead and place the the order, since they make it right when you order, you'll have to wait especially during lunch hours. Also the last time I went they started to accept debit cards but not sure about visa. The place is huge and clean if you want to go as a group, also friendly service."}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying that I had never had authentic Afghani cuisine, but I had high hopes for Bamiyan Kabob.  I figured it would be similar to shwarma and such.    I had been planning to go to Naan Kabob over in Scarborough, but since Bamiyan was in Markham, I figured I'd check it out first.  The restaurant itself is pretty spacious and there is enough parking, as it is part of a  plaza.  The only issue here is getting TO and around the parking lot, as Markham/14th is a busy intersection, densely packed and filled with cars (and the worst drivers outside of Brampton!!).  i was lucky to get there when I did, because not long after I ordered my food, the line-up began to swell!!  Since I didn't want to ruin my low-carb diet, I ordered the regular Kofta Kabob ($6.99), which DID include a fresh Afghani naan that i ended up taking home to give to someone else.  The meat was good and definitely tasty!!  It's not \"fine dining\" by any stretch, but it's a good, filling, inexpensive meal.  The look of the place suggests that it is a \"fast food\" type of place, but you do have to wait a little bit for your food, which they call out to you via a number system.  The staff is generally pleasant and ready to make sure you have everything you need.  I think I still prefer shwarma and associated dishes; however, that is by no means a knock on Afghani food!!   I am definitely coming back here again to try the other menu items!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for over three years now and I must say that this is my favourite afghani restaurant in Toronto. Although I wouldn't say that the food is authentic its still very good compared to other afghani restaurants in the city. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. Their chappli kebabs are the best option on the menu."}
{"text":"I had the chicken plate. Portion was great - definitely filling. You get a fresh, naan (bread), along with your dinner plate. Fresh. Around lunchtime you will face a line up and might have a hard time finding a seat, but by the time your food is ready you'll find a seat- that's the only tricky part."}
{"text":"This place is fucking great. I can't get enough of it. I even find my self driving across the city to get it sometimes. Every friend I've brought here has fell in love with the food and brought other friends who've fallen in love as well. The rice is always fresh, as is the afghan nan. Every chicken dish is amazing. I usually opt for the chicken kofka kabob dinner and it's a ton of food. More than a person should eat.  The choppan kabob (lamb) is fucking delicious. Even if you don't like lamb, you should still give it a try, you'll probably end up liking it.  This place has a decent amount of seating, but it's always packed around lunch/dinner time. Don't even try coming around Ramadan though, cause you'll be waiting for at least an hour. The decor isn't that pleasant, but the food makes up for it tenfold.  Definitely a must try in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's never let us down! Always the best and one airways got the chicken tandoori kebabs"}
{"text":"The food is good but if you want afgan cuisine for a better price n shorter lines and more juicy meat go to kandahar kebab whixh is just a lil north of this location."}
{"text":"Great food, just a real shame they don't answer the phone to accept orders and I have to wait 15 minutes for the food."}
{"text":"Tried the sultani dinner; priciest option but I'm a carnivore so wanted lots of meat. And boy did I get it. Great portions. Lots of rice. Lots of meat, very tender juicy and flavorful. Just reviewing it is making my mouth water again haha. Good salad. Lots of rice wasn't able to finish and the naan was good too. Satisfied.   Took them about 10 mins to make my food and there was no one at the time I went, went just after 11am. So give ur self lots of time. I saw quite a few people order on the phone and pick up, which is what I'll do next time. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Although not a fine-dining establishment, this restaurant ranks as one of the finest restaurants I've regularly eaten at. I've phoned in for large take-out orders and served the food to some very cosmopolitan foodies. I win them over every time. This restaurant (a chain of three, actually), should be internationally famous, if it isn't already.  The meats are cooked to perfection. The rice is gorgeous, so is their homemade naan. The sauces are pefectly spiced. The chaplee kabobs (spicy hamburgers) are delicious but you will likely feel the after-effects for the rest of the day. The half chicken is a real treat too. I always ask for their spiced tea.  The food is inexpensive. The staff are very friendly.  But be warned--this place can get very busy and overrun with kids. Maybe this is an attraction unto itself. It should be, as you will eat with all kinds of people from the neighbourhood, and beyond. Although it is a busy establishment, I would consider it more of a community centre than anything else. Even when the place is busy and there seems to be no seats, the customers somehow pitch in to cooperate. Everything always works out.  This is definitely worth driving out of the downtown to visit."}
{"text":"I have visited this Bamiyan Kabob location twice in the past month. I enjoy the food, as it is consistently good, huge portions for the price, and the ample seating. The parking lot can be very packed, and sometimes difficult to navigate, however I suggest parking towards Pasha turkish restaurant for more spots.  My first visit, I ordered the half chicken dinner which was decent. I found the chicken to be a tad dry, needing the hot sauce and the white sauce to resurrect it. My second time, I ordered the Chaleep which is essentially hamburger meatloaf with a bunch of spices. This was better than the chicken. It came with 2 huge pieces of Chaleep, over a bed of rice and a side of freshly baked bread. Each meal is entitled to 2 sauces (hot sauce or white sauce). I feel like not many know of the white sauce, as its behind the counter and not visible to customers, however I highly suggest you request this with your meal!   All walks of life come through Bamiyan Kabob's doors. My last visit on a cold Friday night saw: Police officers, families with crying babies, office co-workers, friends, and solo diners.  Note: The portions are HUGE, you can definitely share a plate with someone!"}
{"text":"My (much) better half and I can't get enough of this place. We live in the west end, and don't have a car. Whenever we rent, we look for a place in the suburbs to go for dinner, and at least 3/4 of the time we end up at Bamiyan.  Why? The kabobs are the best in town. All of them: Choppan (lamb), Chaplee (a bit like a burger), Kofta, etc. Don't order the Kabob dinner (with rice included). Get the kabob with salad and naan, and a side order of Kabilee Rice (with raisins, carrots and almonds - yum!)  And don't forget the best dish of all -- boulagnee, a kind of stuffed pancake with potatoes and herbs. It's just not a Bamiyan dinner without it.  Prices are low, service is friendly and efficient, and the scene -- Muslim families with lots of kids -- is always bustling and fun."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh to order food, every single time I come here. One of my favourite spots in Markham."}
{"text":"Casual place with a spacious and very clean dinning floor.   Chicken kabobs were perfectly cooked, juicy and not dried out.   Dinner portions are very filling. Rice is nicely spiced. Vegetables and dipping sauce tasted fresh.   Would recommend and come again."}
{"text":"The meat is really well seasoned and always delicious. The rice and salad are boring but not bad. It's pretty expensive for comparable places. The half chicken dinner is great. This is a stable go to place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nice to see Bamiyan Kabob expanding into Righmond Hill. We were looking for a place to have lunch on Labour Day and we were surprised to see they were open on their regular weekday hours. We had their Sultani Kabob and half Chicken Dinner.   Positives: The rice, bread, and the seasonings on the meat. Portions are good size and you will definitely not leave hungry. This location being relatively new, it was clean, bright and spacious. Hope they can keep it tidy even when it gets busy.  Negatives: The meat in the Sultani was a little over-cooked in my opinion and so it was a little tough. I will probaby get them to cook it medium rare next time. I also thought the half chicken was actually going to be a half a bbq'd chicken but its one piece of breast, wing, drumstick and thigh.  Overall: The prices have gone up by $1 or two since I last ate at a Bamiyab but considering inflation and how the business has expanded, I'll definitely go back. It's also a must try if you are looking for something new to eat!"}
{"text":"Wow! There isn't many authentic afghan food places out there, so i'm incredibly fortunate to have stumbled upon this one. Featured in a packed plaza with several big restaurants, this gem is hard to spot, but also provides contrast to the other high end places.   The prices for this place is incredibly fair, given the humongous portions plus the flavourful naan. It isn't a sit-down restaurant service, so the atmosphere is very relaxed and spacious! Perfect hang-out spot.   Food is always fresh and the portions are huge. The only negative is that the rice is fairly flavourless, but  it might just be what it's suppose to taste like.   Mango smoothie is also super delicious and tangy! Different and unique flavour in comparison to your typical mango drink."}
{"text":"My family and I went into this establishment earlier today and it's sad to say but we truly had a horrible dining experience. To Start off for the size of this place (Easily over 4,000 Sq ft) I was expecting some kind of table service or at least decent service. We were given 1 menu for 8 people and a pen and note pad to write our own orders down which I found strange. The woman who put in our order was rushing us and was very rude. I asked for green Chutney and she rudely said no. Not only that but WHAT KIND OF AFGHAN RESTAURANT DOESN'T HAVE PEPPERS!?  We ordered CHABLI KABOB which was Extremely over cooked and rock hard,  SHAMI KABOB which was burned on the outside and raw on the inside, TIKKA KABOB which was dry and burnt, Rice which was under seasoned, & CHOPAN KABOB (LAMB CHOPS) which is my weakness and my first love.  I have had some of the best Lamb Chops at various restaurants all over and I really felt like this place had the worst dry OVER COOKED \"LAMB CHOPS\" of all time even though I asked for MEDIUM RARE.   I WAS TRYING SO HARD TO KEEP CALM IN THIS PLACE AND I'M GLAD TO SAY I WONT BE RETURNING.    I had to force feed my child because of the god awful cuisine.   Ps: I AM AN AFGHAN FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA. I KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT WHEN IT COMES TO AFGHAN FOOD.  MY ADVICE TO YOU FIND A BETTER AFGHAN RESTAURANT BECAUSE OUR CUISINE HAS A LOT MORE STANDARDS THAN THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. They only take cash or debit card which was a bit inconvenience."}
{"text":"I had the tikka dinner and the firnee. I enjoyed the firnee and the naan. It was my first time having the firnee and I really loved it. Tikka was just ok. The next time I come back I'm gonna get anything but tikka.  I didn't enjoy the waiting time. It took more than 15 minutes even when there weren't too many people and I was really hungry at the time. I would come back to try the other meats and the wraps. I'm not at all a fan of salmon but I would give it a try if I see reviews that strongly recommends it.  I'm not too fond of the interior despite what people have been saying about it in the reviews. It feels like eating inside a temporary dining location set up in a warehouse."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. Went with another Yelper who has been here before. The food was delicious! Ordered the tandoori chicken and a steak one. Huge portions! I will definitely come back and try other options."}
{"text":"I would like to visit there especially for their amazing food. Highly recommended for families and friends. I tried the chicken platter and its the BEST undoubtedly."}
{"text":"Great food, especially the half chicken and chicken breast kabab. This location has way more seating than the other location, yet lacks seating. There is tons of wasted space in the dining area which the owner can utilize. That being said, the bottom line is this, the food is so good, that no matter how much seating they create, there will always be a rush. Every time I have been to this restaurant, there is always a rush.  I wish we had a restaurant like this in Chicago. Every Afghan restaurant I've visited in Chicago is not comparable in terms of flavor and quality.  Kabul house in Chicago is good, but it's a different type of cuisine."}
{"text":"I would give this Afghan place a 4.5 stars on an overall bases but they lost the half star because have stopped providing the white sauce.  First impression when getting in... bigger place with plenty seating arrangements and much better than Dixie location. Take a menu and once decided you will have to order and pay for it at the till and wait for the food.   Food wise, I have tried multiple of their kabab dishes. You can select dishes to have both kabab chicken and beef. The kababs were well cooked, tender and tasty. They did give us the red chili sauce but they weren't serving the white sauce as prices have gone up so they wont be serving that. Portion sizing of the meals are good.  Overall, The service fast, there was enough seating and plenty of Parking.  For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve Halal meat."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with bamiyan!!! Always good for some delicious kabobs and mouth watering naan!! I ordered the sultani kabob and half chicken. The sultani kabob (this time) was not as smooth as it normally is. It was a little on the rough over cooked hard to chew side. This is usually not the case ! The chicken was very moist and juicy ! I love the salad and the bread that came with it! Also, the mango shake was delicious!"}
{"text":"Best fast healthy affordable lunch in the area.  Gets busy around noon so go early or closer to 1."}
{"text":"Best Kebob in the city.  Have been going to Bamiyan for lunch on Friday every week for years now have never been disappointed. Consistent, reasonably priced, reasonably fast food."}
{"text":"this place got me hooked on dough, a salty yogurt drink. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and love it all. very tasty but not over powering."}
{"text":"It's okay. I went there expecting the best because it has very amazing reviews (probably made by the same restaurant) and found that the food is average and the size small, plus $$.   I prefer to shop at the Afghan cousin next door... Don't know the name but is better than this place and the sizes are bigger and the food better and you pay a bit less.  Plus the Afghan place is way better looking if you are bringing a date."}
{"text":"I love Bamiyan kabobs. Juicy kabobs, sumptuous meal, great value. I have tried 4-5 different dinner plates in about 20 times I have been here and have always came back home happy and satisfied. I have been to other locations too and liked it there too. It's not an upscale/classy restaurant to bring your date to. It's kind of place you need to go to get your fix, just like Tim Horton's (the quality is as consistent)."}
{"text":"This place was unbelievably good! Fresh food, fast service, and the flavors were great!"}
{"text":"I don't get it. I used to come here often about 5-6 years ago when it was still packed and busy. It's still the same but the prices have definitely risen. Service was fine, food tasted good but a tandoori half chicken with no rice but an extra naan is $12?! A bit pricey if you ask me.   Compare that to Nan and Kabob on Lawrence, you get the same meal for $9. That's all I have to say.   Get take out, there is no space to sit on a busy afternoon or evening."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed, sadly. I have heard of Bamiyan, not only through Yelp, but from my friends who absolutely love this place. So, when my bf and I were in the area, we decided to venture in. We went on a Saturday night and to be expected, the place was packed. I was already scanning some tables where people were just about to leave. There was on empty table and I quickly bee-lined towards it.  My bf decided to get the Chicken Breast Kabob with rice, salad, and naan and the Chaplee Kabob which turned out to be my fave...the spices were so delicious and the meat tender. While the chicken breast was tender, it was nothing special. Add to that rice and salad, I could have been anywhere, and not necessarily in a restaurant serving Afghan cuisine. The one good thing about this place are the portions and price. For $10, you get a HUGE plate of rice (it takes half of the big plate) and comes with meat and salad AND naan. It really does fill you up.  My bf said that this location was smaller than the other one he visited, so while I don't mind doing a \"fast-food\" establishment once in a while, I won't be coming back here anytime soon. The place is crowded with families, babies, kids running around, long lines and just chaos. Saturday night or no Saturday night, I really just wanted to eat and leave. It's the type of place where you put your fork down and people think you are leaving and take over the table by placing the baby carriage in front of you.  The food on the other hand...I don't know, was plain at best. I have never tasted or been introduced to Afghan cuisine other than Bamiyan, so would those from the area consider the food authentic? Real? Delicious? (For me, it would be a similar idea to a Holy Chow masked as Chinese cuisine, but for those in the know, it is far from it). If I wanted to get rice, salad, and naan, I could go to any place that served those types of foods.   Best for takeout and the only thing going for Bamiyan (or this location) is the relatively tasty meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Good and clean food and great value.  Have tried thi Mississauga and East end locations as well. Never been disappointed. Always hits the spot.   One of the less visible items on the menu is the chicken Korma, which is bloody delicious. Goes well with the bread ;)  They also allow you to just get the grilled items sans the rice, bread or salad. This again is not well advertised, but is an option.   Food:4/5  Ambience: 3/5  Rarely dine in, it is mostly set up for take out.   Service: 3.75/5 Nothing to complain about. However, it can be a while before you pick up your order. It might be because of how things are prepared. Staff are pleasant.   Value: 4.5/5  Repeat: Yes"}
{"text":"Always dependable for a good meal. I always get ready chicken and tandoori chicken. The kabob is alright but nothing crazy special. Definitely recommend, and love that it's in the areq"}
{"text":"popped by here for lunch today thinking it would be a quick in and out but boy are they busy during lunch time and with good reason. They're food is delicious.  Because I was strapped for time I got a veggie wrap which to my surprise was very flavourful! I definitely WILL be back for their lamb dinner plate, I had people walk by me with it and it smelt amazing!!!!   my coworker had a mango smoothie and she was raving about how good it was.   definitely check it out, if you're going for lunch make sure you factor in time for the wait."}
{"text":"Food is usually good BUT...the service is going down the tubes at the Markham location. I live nearby so I go there often for takeout. Last week I called in my order...then my pregnant wife went to pick it up. She stood there for at least a half and hour waiting for our food. While customer after customer got their food my wife asked where are's was. Eventually after the third time the lady pulled a bag out from under the counter. It had been sitting there the whole time. They took our money but gave us cold food and she had to wait. I proceeded to call the manager. Her name is Nilab and she profusely apologized and offered full compensation for the meal. She handed the phone to one of her staff who took our name, phone number and receipt number. I told them I would come another day for the meal. Called in my order yesterday after work, got there and the assistant manager Sarah said she had no memos about the incident or any compensation. She advised I pay for the food and then on the weekend when Nilab was back in I could ask for a refund. I told her that there is no way I'm going to reward bad service by giving them my money. I left and went to Swiss Chalet. I'm just glad a Paramount is coming soon to the same plaza. That's a classy joint, and as a Peace Officer they have a good discount for us."}
{"text":"We found this place on yelp because of the crazy waiting at Frederick (Hakka restaurant) down the road. So glad we made the choice not too wait at the Frederick because Bamiyan is AMAZING!   This is the first time I ever had Afghan cuisine, so we order according to what most people recommended on yelp, the chaplee kabob with salad and naan, and a side order of tikka kabob. The flavour combination of chaplee is very new to me, lot more spices than other kabob!! (if you can't handle spicy food, be careful with this one). The patties were super juicy and tender, paired perfectly with freshly baked naan. The Tikka was the star tho, such tender well season whole meat kabob. Must try it with the hot sauce, that extra kick is so on the spot!"}
{"text":"The best location for Bamiyan chain, friendly service and excellent food. This location is not overly busy and the staff are actually nice, unlike the other locations which are much more busier and downright rude staff. Food quality is great, but be prepared for some nasty burps afterwards. The meats are heavily marinated and salted so the after effects are pretty stinky."}
{"text":"Generally, I love to eat at this place. My favourite is the barg kebab (\"filet mignon\" kebab) with the Greek salad. The meat is mild but flavourful and tender ..dusted with sumac so it has a distinct savoury tartness. The Greek salad is filled with green peppers, tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese & black olives..it has a really yummy balsamic dressing that is quite salty..so eat at your own risk, it's better if you ask for it on the side.   I must say this place isn't great for take out, once the food gets put into styrofoam trays, cold..it really doesn't taste the same even after you warm it up.   They have amazing naans, but recently I noticed they have decreased the size of them.  They are very heavy on the salt, so this isn't something I eat often..but sometimes the craving comes along and you gotta do what you gotta do.  Service is also terrible, the people always mess up your order no matter how clearly you try and convey something. They're extremely unapologetic too. But oh well, I don't come here for the service.  Yes, there's better options for afghani food but this place hits the spot"}
{"text":"I was in the area and chose to go here based on the reviews I found and I'm definitely glad I did. The food was great, freshly prepared, with a nice hot Afghani-style naan on the side. I'll be making return trips to this location often."}
{"text":"Bamiyan has to be the only restaraunt Ive ever been to which is always consistent foodwise. Never disappoints. Love their sultani kabob, chapli kabob, tandoori, etc. The bread is so soft and so unique. The sauces take the the food to another level. Service is super fast."}
{"text":"I came to Bamiyan about a year ago when I was studying at York University and it is by far the best Afghan food I've ever had! The food was very authentic, tasted delicious and very fresh. I ordered the chicken and kofta kabob plate which came with Kabuli rice, salad, and Afghan bread. The meat was juicy and cooked perfectly, and the rice...well, the rice was so good that it makes my mouth water every time I think of it! The servings were enormous which was great considering the price. I came there hungry, ate quite a lot and still had plenty left over! I would definitely be stopping by during my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today after a meeting and was super hungry and being one of the only fast casual spots in the East Beaver Creek plaza I figured I'd give them a whirl. Walking in, it looks like it might be a fancier restaurant (it used to be a sit-down Mr Greek - so much of the interior infrastructure is still the same or similar) but it's a fast food style set up. Walk up to cash order and wait for your order on a tray before sitting down.  I had a tough time figuring out the menu and my confusion only grew when I asked the cashier for some explanations on the menu items. I'm sensitive to English being a difficult language to grasp when you're from another country but it was a really tough interaction to navigate without getting a little frustrated when she appeared to be getting annoyed by me asking for clarification on what she was saying. Again not a huge deal, I just ended up pointing until we got there.  I had the Sultani combo which I think was explained to me as a higher quality meat item, with a steak like kabob and a kabob kafta (ground beef) served with salad and naan. All in it was about $16-17, not bad but definitely bordering on pricey.  The meal took about 10 minutes which was good with me since that meant they were cooking the meat to order and not simply warming anything up. The kabobs were nicely seasoned and cooked but having had sultani at Persian restaurants before I recognised that from a taste difference BK was to sultani what Sunset Grill would be to steak and eggs. It's \"good\" but not what you really wanted. I do have to agree with some of the other reviews that mentioned the salad is just iceberg with a side of essentially picco di gaillo (tomatoes), and the naan was not what you would expect when hearing naan - basically a dense bread shaped like a naan.  Was it edible? Yes. What is amazing? No. Was it bad? Not really, it was OK. And that's not bad, I just think you can do better. The experience and the food were what I would imagine fast food middle eastern would be, much as McDonald's is to hamburgers and french fries - it'll never be the best burger ever but it will always do the trick.  I'd come back in a pinch but with more time I'd explore other local options.  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"I had the tandoori chicken kabob. It came with rice and Caesar salad and a giant peace of bread (I think it's called naan bread). Portion was huge. Chicken was spicy. I guess the bread was my favorite part, it was soft and warm. The only down side is you have to wait like ten minutes for your food to come and they call out your number on a speaker."}
{"text":"this place is a good bang for the buck if you are looking to stuff your face full of reasonably tasting food for a reasonable price.   the meats taste interesting and different, but they are just not that unique from other establishments like paramount foods or any other middle eastern joints. the rice has a flavourful taste with some spices mixed in. 3/5  the prices are great and you can might be able to get away with buying one dinner for two people 3/5  the restaurant itself is clean and quite large (3/5), although located in a weird strip plaza type set up. I do have to say that I was more impressed with some other bamiyan kabob places, namely the one across from york university on keele st.  so the place is A-OK, inline with the criteria for 3 stars out of 5. nothing special but not to bad."}
{"text":"This might seem weird but this place felt oddly like home. I usually don't like busy places, especially when vacationing, but when we stopped for dinner here I immediately fell into a kind of lull you only feel during huge family gatherings lol  The food was amazing! The quantities were substantial and although we had so much, we finished it all really quickly.  Despite being so crowded people were standing outside, the employees were working fast and were very warm and friendly. All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"Went to Bamiyan Kabob at Markham location with family. The ordering line was so long,it took 20 minutes to order. We had ordered Sultani Kabob, Chapli Kabob and Tandoori chicken platters. It took another half an hour for food to have it ready, everything was made fresh, The portions were generous, the meat was perfect and the afghani bread was awesome. Now at this particular location, tables are nailed to the ground hence cannot move it, if you are a large group, A/C was not working properly, therefore couldn't enjoy food in almost 100F and on the top of it, they don't serve the white sauce, you have to ask for it. Being a New Yorker, the white sauce is an essential part for an Afghani food. Last but not the least, it's a self service cash/debit restaurant. I would have given them 3 and a half stars, but there's no way for doing that on Yelp. Will I go back for this food? may be yes, but I might try take away!"}
{"text":"A pretty big space with lots of seating. The food was great and the wait wasn't very long at all."}
{"text":"Usually very consistent food and a great choice if your hankering for some good Afghani cuisine. Love the Naan and Kofta Kebabs, been going here for years and apart from a few overly charred kebabs once in a while its been a great experience everytime!"}
{"text":"I love this place (and I've been to another one of their locations as well). The food is consistancy delicious - I've gone fairly frequency over the last couple of years and have always left happy. My favourite is the tandoori chicken dinner but the kofta, barg, chicken break, tikka beef, and wraps are all good. And that fresh naan with the spicy dipping sauce is fanastic. I highly recommend you check out Bamiyan Kabob!"}
{"text":"Their food tastes good however it was not anything special. It tasted like any other afghan food spot. They are generous with their portion sizes."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best Afghani Restaurant in North America and they've maintained their consistency for the past 10+ yrs. Keep it up Brothas!"}
{"text":"I came here during a break so time was of the essence, the line up was not that big but it took almost 15 minutes to get my food. The rice and chicken were aaamazing. The salad was disappointing as the their were a few too many stems and not enough salad dressing. I would come back but not when time is limited."}
{"text":"The food is good, no complaints, but the wait is really long for such a place. The stuff wasn't friendly at all. My boys were bored and started acting out, so the manager comes up to us and tells me that the kids are bothering other patrons. I was really pissed off, you don't come to a place like this expecting half an hour wait before you get your food. We will not come again..."}
{"text":"The sauce they give with the naan/afghan bread is the bomb. Spicy and too good.   We've tried the chicken dishes, and some of the lamb. The chicken is great quality, done well not too dry. Alone each part of the dish may not be the best, but put them together and it's amazing. The sauce, the rice, the meat and the bread. Yum.  So go check it out!!"}
{"text":"Bamiyan is good for casual dining or take-out. This is my first time trying Afghan food; I expected it would be very similar to Persian cuisine, and I was right, but it seems to borrow some of that spicy kick from neighbouring Pakistan. The spice here is more of an undertone though, not overwhelming at all - it was probably my favourite part of the meal. I got the Tikka Kabob (beef) which came with salad, rice, and Afghan bread all for $12. Portions are very generous. The rice had a great flavour too, tasted like cinnamon and allspice. Service was good, I waited close to ten minutes for the food which is fine with me since its fresh. I'll be back for more take-out in the future!"}
{"text":"I know most reviews are good here but I didn't really enjoy this place. Wasn't a big fan of the kabobs. Nothing against it but just not my cup of tea! I didn't enjoy the flavors of the meat. I also smelt like the kabobs when I left the restaurant!!!! Portions are good but service was not great."}
{"text":"Being a rebel I decided to order the caesar salad with tandoori chicken, instead of the rainbow of kabobs on their menu, because I wasn't especially hungry. I didn't have very high expectations, but boy was I wrong. They should call this place \"Bottomless Bamiyan\" because the portions are huge. My salad, like all items I presume, came with complimentary (hot!) naan. Generous chicken chunks - tender with a warm spice. Fairly fresh salad with the perfect dose of dressing, and extra, spicy dressing on the side.   I'd advise ordering in a take-out box; I'm willing to bet you a kabob that you won't finish.   And in terms of service, let's not kid ourselves. You walk in and order from the counter; don't expect to be handheld through the daily specials and escorted to your table. I was happy enough that they let me come in and sit down first to browse the menu. They also offered me yogurt sauce, which is a bonus in customer service, since another Yelper claims that they don't give it to you unless you ask."}
{"text":"I've always loved this kind of food!  I tried both the sultani/Choppan kabobs, They were both very delicious but i prefer the choppan kabobs(which only came with 3/4 pieces of meat) but in the end i thought it tasted better since the sultani was a bit too salty for my likings.  But overall  food : yummy price : ok... a little pricey environment: Good! lots of people , Lots of tables for dinning in!  and happy employees!"}
{"text":"I am all about food. My wife is not much of a cook so I eat out a lot. These guys check out  very delicious kabobs. I love the chicken breast and salad cuz i like to eat healthy. Very delicious food!  You guys should try Afghan food!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best kabob restaurant in Markham.   The parking and local traffic are terrible, but it's worth the hassle. If you arrive after 7pm or so on a weekend there will be long lineups, and seating might be hard to find -- but it's popular for a reason!  We've tried most of the kabobs on the menu, and they've all been delicious."}
{"text":"The chicken was so juicy and well-seasoned.  Make sure you get a little container of the hot sauce.  The rice and salad, nothing special.  You get a bit of chopped tomatoes and onions too.  I liked the naan, fresh and warm.  Not a fan of the baskets they are served in though.  Can you wash/clean baskets??"}
{"text":"I was super excited when this location near my house started serving Mantu, I've had it at Naan & Kabob and several other Bamiyan locations. I was extremely disappointed that the Mantu did not have cilantro on it... the display picture in the restaurant clearly showed cilantro as a topping and all other Bamiyan locations serve it with cilantro as well. After asking the cashier she confirmed with the cook it doesn't have cilantro on it, I showed her a picture on my phone from Mantu I had just ordered days ago from another Bamiyan (Mississauga) and she laughed hysterically saying \"she believes me and will note the suggestion\". I even asked if she could simply just give me cilantro to add on and the cook said no... Other than that the Mantu had a strong black pepper and tomato flavour, it was lacking split peas and yogurt. Overall I was disappointed with the customer service and lack of consistency across locations."}
{"text":"It was okay. The people were really nice and friendly. My boyfriend and I went together, and I decided just to get rice and naan because I wasn't very hungry, but my boyfriend was quite hungry so he got a dinner. He got the \"tikka\" kabob plate. Each dinner plate comes with naan, salad, and rice.   My boyfriend loved his kabob, and I tried it and it was pretty good. The rice was kind of greasy and there was not much taste. The only thing that made the food different from other middle-east style eateries was the salad dressing which my boyfriend thought tasted like Big Mac sauce, and this other sauce for the meat that he said tasted kind of like salsa (not that it was bad, just saying).  The actual venue was extremely busy; we went at about 8pm on a Saturday night. There was a lot of tables in the restaurant but they were all full. A varied mix of people; families with children, groups of friends, couples... everyone. We decided to get takeout because really hectic restaurants are uncomfortable to me.  I would not go out of my way again for a meal here, but if I happen to be in the area and I am hungry, I would probably go for some naan or something. The people were very  nice, and I like to support nice people! :)"}
{"text":"Never had Afghani food until I came here!  The service is quick but friendly!  I loved the kebobs and I'm so addicted to their rice!  It makes sense why they are so busy!"}
{"text":"Bamayan is actually the name of a place in Afghanistan. A place famous for its delicious cuisine, so it was not unusual that I went into this place expecting authentic and delicious food, right? WRONG, walking in you see tacky stone all over the walls. I've never seen much flag stone in Afghanistan but I thought, whatever it is the food that counts. I went with my family of 5, we each ordered only an entrée and drinks, no appetizers, no desserts, the total was still $70!! With a price like that I could've gone to a nice steak house, but kabob can be as good as steak if done right so I remained Optimistic.         Here is something you may find surprising, despite the fact that their food was extremely overpriced they still didn't have waiters, and the cashier was rushing us even though there was no one behind us in line (Afghan tribal men are famed for their hospitality)! Terrible service aside when the food finally was ready (it took 30 minutes), I got excited. The portion size was huge (somewhat justifying the price) and the aroma was inviting. Unfortunately it is difficult to smell over salting. I asked for the meat to be slightly pink and received what looked to be dog food. DRY as HELL. I may be being a bit harsh but for the price I was expecting good food, and received overcooked, over seasoned, dry meat with undercooked rice.          Looking at the other reviews, it may have been just me that had such a bad experience however I will try it again, maybe it was a one time mistake or I just ordered the wrong thing (barg kabob, or something like that, (fillet minion type thing). Either way my first experience was truly worthy of the one star and not a Michelin one."}
{"text":"Rating: 3 1/2*  I love kabobs since my introduction to them a few years ago in Mississauga. I have never been to Bamiyan before in any of their locations so we decided to go last Saturday around 5pm.   This Richmond Hill location is in a busy plaza surrounded by the likes of Touro Churrascaria, Jack Astor's and Scaddabush. Parking is plentiful as it can be shared amongst the businesses.   From the outside and inside, this restaurant is huge. Plenty of booths and tables available however, you can tell that some care is needed for the upholstery. They are either worn or ripped in some places.   The restaurant works on a cafeteria style that you order your food first and pay. Get a table and your order will be called out. The number is in the receipt. Once you are done, you can leave your tray and dishes on top of the garbage cans or on the tables. A worker goes around collecting the trays and dishes while cleaning the tables.   The place gets very busy as the dinner rush came right after us. Also be willing to spend a minimum of at least 15 minutes for your food to be ready as your meats are cooked to order. This is a very good thing.   We decided to order the Chicken Tandoori dinner and the Half of Chicken dinner. Each dinner comes with rice and iceberg lettuce, diced tomatoes. Also you get Naan. They don't look like your typical Naan but I found it to be the best part of the meal. Portions are large. I loved the meats. They were seasoned very well and were flavourful. The sides however were fillers. Rice was bland and the lettuce unremarkable.   This is a solid place but cannot beat Watan in Mississauga.  #38 of 2018"}
{"text":"The beef kabob was very good and flavourful. Chicken is too try. Kind of burnt and not juicy anymore. I want to leave 5 star for their hot sauce. It's so refreshing and has a taste of lemon in it. But overall it's a 4 star considering price, portion,staff friendliness."}
{"text":"Probably the best halal place in the city! Love their huge and insanely tasty kabob dinners."}
{"text":"Your order like you would at any other Mediterranean or Middle Eastern restaurant and you get this ridiculously generous portion of food.   I ordered the Sultani Kabob and let me tell you I've never enjoyed meat more in my life than in this moment because of the flavours going on in my mouth with the juiciness and tenderness of the meat. It was just explosions going off in my mouth and I wad enjoying every moment of it.  The rice was fragrant and delicious and extremely generous I couldn't even finish the bread that it came wih and LET ME TELL YOU THE BREAD IS CRISPY AND SOFT AND CHEWY ON THE INSIDE.  The salad was refreshing and the spicy red sauce that came with it (similar to a chutney but im 100% sure that's not what it is or called) was the cherry on top. I'm crazy about my sauces and if a dish has great sauce, this is a must eat.  An otherworldly amusement park delivered on a plate."}
{"text":"Okay so right off the bat there are so many little things this place can do to make it so much more attractive. There service and food really does resemble fast food places. In my opinion they are pricey for the food they give. The meat is always good but the salad is such a huge disappointment. I can't even call it a salad its lettuce and tomatoes and onion.  The meat is good but they should lower their prices slightly. the naan was not traditional naan its just bread. They just started serving salmon now and that was pretty good. the hot sauce is good but it has a much different taste then other hot sauces and is pretty mild.  I came here a couple months ago and found a hair in the food so they made another one for me and gave my money back. overall this place is good if you really are craving bamiyan kabob and nothing else."}
{"text":"Went to this location last week for lunch.   I ordered the half chicken and expected it to come with rice. But to my surprise it came with just salad. The chicken tasted fine, nothing too special but not bad by any means, but the salad I didn't eat (not generally a fan of Salad which I'd why I expected rice as a side).   We had to wait a good 15 to 20 mins for our food from when we ordered to when we got it even though it was dine in.   Overall, I haven't lost my interest in Afghan food after eating here and will not recommend this cuisine to a friend anymore."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in the area. If you're looking for a delicious meal for a good price look no further. You can easily get one of their dinners for $10-12 and it comes with an ample serving of meat, rice, salad, and the star of the show, afghani naan. Yum! If you're getting a smaller meal that doesn't come with the naan you can get it on the side for $1.   They have a good selection of food items, like wraps and salads, to choose from so you don't necessarily have to go with a dinner plate. And if I didn't already mention it before, Get. The. Naan."}
{"text":"FOOD: always delicious and portions are gigantic. Dinner combos often come with a generous portion of rice, pita bread, salad, and delicious meat.   AMBIENCE: feels like a gigantic and spacious cafeteria, tbh. No complaints and large area to wait for food. Dirty trays were piling up on the side though.   SERVICE: long line up for lunch, waited about 15 min for food. Throughout was fast but the servers didn't have enough time to really be kind or polite. It's hard to flag their attention at the counter but otherwise, they do what you ask.   PRICES: will set you back around $12-15 after tax. No need to pay tips.   TIPS: the lack of visuals for food is a bit of a downside but all the food is delicious so there's generally no bad choice.   They only accept cash and debit for now.   They use a microphone for falling out finished orders so feel free to find a seat and they'll call.   Need to ask for extra sauces - recommend getting both white and red!"}
{"text":"A nice location, with lots of space. Had heard about this chain from a friend, so decided to try it out. On my way by during work, so stopped in quickly for a fast lunch.   A bit disorganized as I walked in and people were standing everywhere. No discernible line for ordering and staff having to deal with multiple things at the same time made things a bit confusing.   I wasn't too hungry, so I got a Greek Salad. Quite a good salad, but the bread that everything comes with was awesome. Comes with a cool spicy sauce to dip, which pulls it all together.   Will drop by again to get something with meat next time, when I'm more hungry!"}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here last Friday. The restaurant was so spacious and clean!  My husband and i split the Sultani Kabob dinner which came with a piece each of barg (filet mignon) and kofta (ground beef), side salad, basmati rice and Naan. We just added an extra order of kofta  (meat only). It was just enough for 2 people. The kofta was better than the barg which was a bit on the dry side. The meat was grilled to order which was good but translates to a bit of a wait. I have tasted kofta that was more juicy...the juciest one from Sofra grill, if I remember correctly. The naan was on the crispy side. But overall good value for money. Next time though we would stick to the kofta. We ordered a kofta dinner to go for our son and he licked the plate clean."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place i have to say the food is amazing i went back a few times after that i would definitely recommend it to others."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY delicious Afghani food! One of the best I've tried in GTA, NJ, NY, & Chicago area, which says a lot! The food quality and taste are always consistent. Granted it takes time for the food to get ready and the place is small and not very formal but the food is always worth it! Everything on the menu is great, my favorite is Sultani kababs! Their red chutney is pretty damn good as well! Can't wait to go back to Canada and devour it again!"}
{"text":"I Just went to Bamiyan kabob with my wife for dinner and we ordered two half chicken dinners with Chapli kabobs. When the food came it looked little over cooked and once we started eating our food we realized the chicken was old & frozen and the taste was not it used to be. Their quality has gone down and they have also increased the price. I will never go back there again and I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there. The Canadian food inspection agency should visit them and fine them for not giving people what they are paying for and also check their high sodium content. Their food is full of sodium for some reason."}
{"text":"Large portions and great flavour. Fast food joint with ample seating but can get very busy where it's hard to find a seat.  Excellent place for a quick satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Decent location for Bamiyan Kabob and Afghan in general. I have found that the prices have increased over the years, the food maintains its quality, so the value has become questionable. I have also found quantities can vary vastly. I remember receiving eight large sized pieces of chicken kabob in the past and was only greeted by six medium-sized in recent visits. I am glad the nan, salad, and rice have stayed consistent in quality and quantity. The staff are typically friendly and run the establishment smoothly. I have noticed the floor at this location are quite sticky; not inherently dirty, but there is definitely a sticky residue on the floors, and definitely unsettling when you're there to have a meal. The mango smoothie comes from an odd self-serve type machine, so the ingredients and quality are questionable, especially for the price of $3. Decent casual eats nonetheless."}
{"text":"Went during busy lunch hour with group of 4. Everyone in my group got their food at the same time but my food came 20 minutes later. It was very displeasing. When I asked the cashier she apologized and said I should sit down and she would personally bring the food over to our table. Eventually the food came and they apologized once again. The food was good however and the portion size was very large. I guess I just had an unlucky experience, but the food was great overall."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken tandoori, rice, naan and salad. Excellent value and solid ambiance. Also, highly consistent food in what you get."}
{"text":"Got the tandoori chicken, which came with a salad, rice, and fresh naan. The store itself is cleaner and brighter than most places in that neighbourhood. This is a great place to eat if you are in the york university neighbourhood (lots of free parking)! The only reason I am taking off a star is because the wait is relatively longer than other similar restaurants. Make sure to factor in 15/20mins for the wait!"}
{"text":"It's similar to the one in the city, I didn't really notice much difference in taste.  It's just unfortunate that take out doesn't seem to be as much food as eating in the restaurant as I felt I could finish it, vesus always having a heaping of rice and salad left over."}
{"text":"A carnivore's delight.  Ordered the tikki kebob dinner, choppan kebob, kofta kebob, and sultani (combo of barg and kofta).  No matter which one you choose, you will be delighted with the meat on the plate, only hoping for more. The salad, seems still sort of like an after thought, lost in a sea of rice piled on top of it, but it still a good change of pace and desire for greens.  The naan is tasty, not overly doughy but still delicious.  Would recommend going back to try their expansive menu."}
{"text":"WIth so many afghan restaurants in the market. These guys are definitely the originals . But they need to start accepting Visa/MC . Cash and debit only is so 2004. Step up your game guys. Just for 2.5% service fee you are losing a lot of your business. One of the reasons i dont go here is because its way too crowded and dont accept Visa mastercard."}
{"text":"Easily the best thing on Overlea, IMO.  A small place in a strip mall that serves kebabs, naan, rice and salad, as well as a few others dishes.  The meat dishes are cooked-to order and served with an afghan flatbread which is crisper than indian naan, but still quite tasty, as well as salad and optionally rice.  I've had the lamb chops (Choppan) and beef (Barg), both of which are quite nice, but my favourite are the chicken kabobs, which are surprisingly juicy despite having been grilled. It's easy to overcook chicken, but Bamiyan does not.  I've seen lots of others, but haven't tried them all yet.    Basically, I wouldn't suggest that you go up to Overlea just to eat here, but if you're in the area, you definitely want to go here rather than somewhere else quite nearby.  The Boulagnee was interesting, but a little bland (IMO) and the firnee had a very gelatinous texture, but was reasonably tasty."}
{"text":"I have only had their tandoori dinner on multiple occasions and it was really good. The chicken was very juicy and flavourful. However, i do find the chicken to be a little on the salty side a few times. But i douse most of my food with sodium so it wasn't a big deal for me.   The tandoori dinner comes with the naan bread, which is really good  when you eat it while its warm and fluffy. They also give a hot sauce with all this and it is to die for. Its not like any store bought hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chapli kabab platter and it was pretty delicious. The chapli kabab was perfectly tender and spices were spot on. Hubby had kafta kabab & that's what he always loves. But chapli kabab is a must try."}
{"text":"I hate giving things 5 star reviews.. not because im an ass lol.. but because 5 stars is a near perfect experiance..    Bamiyan.. Blows my mind away.. They have a very clean restaurant, good friendly smiling staff, and most importantly.. amazing food.  I work near this place and honestly, If im on a cheat day, Bamiyan holds the key to my heart.    First off what is hot? What's worth ordering?   I highly Recommend a Barg Dinner.  I've heard this is lamb, but something is telling me it's beef.  Either way.. Barg is delicious, cooked perfectly everytime, and extreamly flavourful.  It beats the Sultanese Kabob, the Kofta, the whatever else is on the menu, and it's a dollar less.  It comes with salad, rice, and a hot fresh na'an.  So what makes this place amazing?  Everything is fresh.  You can taste the freshness in every bite.  The dinners come out in a reasonable timing, the meat is cooked to perfection, and the sauses provided, a special \"salsa\" taste unbelievable.  The Na'an is so good, yeah it's a piece of bread but its a hot fresh, large piece of bread that is a delight with your meal!  The portion size is Epic! and honestly you can break 1 meal down into 2.  In all Honesty, no matter how much I ramble on, I think you should just go out and eat here.  I 100% recommend it, you won't be upset you gave this a try, and I guarentee you WILL be hooked!  The prices are around $10-$13 depending if you get an extra Na'an, or some sides, but as I said before, you can basically break 1 meal down into 2.   Great bang for your buck!   Bon apitite!"}
{"text":"I felt so foreign in this place. I had no expectations and was just waiting for the experience. The food looked like greek or meditarian food. Boy was I wrong and so surprisingly happy to find this place.  The restaurant looks like a big food court with only one restaurant in it. I orderd the Barg Kabob dinner (yes for lunch!). Right after you order your food they will give you a receipt with a number on it. Go find a seat and wait for your number to be yelled out for pick up - don't forget your naan bread. The main thing I look for in a kabob or any meat dish is how well the meat is cooked. The kabob was cooked to near perfection, very tender and juicy. The sides were nothing to laugh about either. They scream at you for attention and you can't help but pay lots of attention to them. I ate them all. The naan bread was very huge (yes huge) and well toasted. I basically cleaned out my plate and all that was left were my fork and knife.  I never had Afganian food but this is the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"This review is for Mississauga location:  I have been their loyal customer for good 8 years. The food in terms of flavor and quality has never changed. I love their sultani kabab dinner which is my personal favorite.  Their barg kabob, chopan kabab are both excellent.  However,  their chicken items aren't my personal favorite to be honest. Prices have risen over the years for sure. Buy hey! Quality remains the same good. Portions are huge and you can't resist the aroma and flavor.  Big thumbs up for Sultani Kabab. Please don't try their dessert called \"firni\" cuz it's just corn starch mixed in milk and brought to a boil and nothing else. It's just like a jello . If you have tried Pakistani or perhaps Indian then you know firni isn't supposed to have a Jello consistency.  It should rather have rubbary consistency in which milk has cooked for several hours to get thickened up and not corn starch."}
{"text":"Wanting to step out of my comfort zone I decided, after some hesitation, to try Bamiyan Kabob.  Since I've never tried Afghani food, I really had no idea what to expect.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  Bamiyan Kabob serves lamb, chicken and beef kabobs dinners (with rice, salad and naan bread included), meals without the rice and wraps.  Other salads and side dishes are also available.  I decided to try the Kofta Kabob dinner.  The two skewers of seasoned marinated ground beef were flavorful, moist, but at the same time not overly fat and 'bouncy' in texture.  The rice was simply magnificent.  Try this rice and you'll never look at simple plain white rice the same way again.  The salad and freshly made naan bread were also very good.  The restaurant is spacious and clean sporting a fast food concept but where you give your order at the counter and wait for your receipt number to be called when your meal is ready.  As mentioned in Sameer D.'s review, food preparation time is on the high side but I'd rather wait and have freshly made than be quickly served with food from warming bins.  Also, try the firnee, a pleasantly sweet custard-like pudding dessert.  A perfect complement to a spicy meal.  Prices for the dinners range from $9-$12 but the large serving sizes definitely put these meals in the 'good value' category.  I definitely recommend Bamiyan Kabob and I will be going back to try their other meat offerings."}
{"text":"Really good food...very good meat...huge portions...like the spices used...could have better naans....not really a big fan of the ones served...but everything else is nice!!!"}
{"text":"I happened to go to Baamiyan on the muslim festival of Eid. Place was rammed. I would think that would diminish the quality of food. It didnt, Barg was amazing, so was the tandoori chicken. high quality meat, great portion and service. The tomoto sauce works as a great compliment to the two different kind of salads, this is a fast growin afghan chain. However i still prefer the many many persian Kebab spots around yonge and steeles. Value and less wait time. However, no complaints."}
{"text":"Food in this place is the best. Meat tastes so fresh, and rice is great. I had the firney dessert and it was really good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something different (i.e. non-Asian) in Richmond Hill/Markham, Bamiyan is a good choice. Its a rather large location in the Beaver Creek/Hwy 7 area.   The thing to order here is the kabobs, and there are many options to choose from. The kabobs come standard with fresh garden salad and Afghan naan, which is a much thicker naan when compared to Indian.   We ordered the kofta kabob and chicken kabob. Kofta is basically seasoned ground beef while the chick is similar to Greek souvlaki. The key here is the meat is not dry. Moist and tender meat makes such a big difference. I cannot say how many times you go to a Greek restaurant and the souvlaki is sooo dry. Well you won't have that problem here!  Everything is made to order so expect to wait about 10 minutes for your food. Also, if you come at lunch, come at 11:45 and you will save yourself a lot of time as there is a line around noon!"}
{"text":"Been to the plaza a lot. There are a lot of restaurants there, but usually we try something else. Wanted to try something different so went to this location. We thought it would be similar to Greek food because it used to be a Mr. Greek, but we were very wrong.   It seems to be an afghan place. There were no pork dishes. All their orders were very simple and there wasn't a huge selection. Tried the beef, chicken breast, and the spicy shredded beef. I forgot the name of the dishes.   The meat was amazing. I especially like the spicy dish. The rice was good; different from Chinese and western rice. Not too soft, but not too hard. The salad was average.   It wasn't too expensive compared to the rest of the restaurants in the plaza. It was a self serve location so there were no waiters or anything. Just ordered from the counter like McDs  Pro  Good food Fast Service.    Con  No service. If you want someone to wait on you, then you are going to the wrong place."}
{"text":"This is my family's go-to place for traditional Afghan food. Their food is always fresh and top-quality. I usually go for the Barg Kebob with rice and salad. It's more chewy than a lot of the others, but the flavour and taste is just amazing. When I'm a little more hungry, I go for the Sultani Kebob, which is a mix of the barg and kofta Kebob. The chicken and half-chicken breast kebobs there are also great. Actually they are all good no matter which one you choose. I usually go to the don mills location, because it is closest to me and space there is a bit tight so you may have to wait a little and seat yourself, especially on Fridays and weekends. You order first at the front and they give you a number. I heard this location is better than the other 2-3, and I do have to agree as I have been to one other one and it hasn't been as good. I always end up leaving this restaurant happy, full but thirsty. Kebobs can do that to you. Highly recommend it! It'll always be one of my favourites."}
{"text":"This place is near my work, so for lunchtimes i find myself here very often for a goos portion of rice and meats .  Honestly, Im persian, i love my kababs and chicken kebabs, and I do love their food here .   Chicken Tandoori is FANTASTIC. Chicken breast kabab is very good. The barg is also great.  They already serve a ginormous rice portion , and because im not a fan of the salad they put even more rice for me which lasts a good 2-3 meals for me lol.   For dessert, definitely try Firnee if youre looking foe something sweet & creamy."}
{"text":"Cheap people that don't allow you to take more than one little container of sauce per meal. I've actually never seen this at any restaurant.. even mcdonalds will give u extra sauce. Why not charge an extra 25 cents and keep your customers happy ? Losing an extra star because some of the cashiers are extremely rude. Do you not teach customer service over there ? Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. The value is great and the food is very decent?.  Normally order the chicken kabobs."}
{"text":"I got the tandoori chicken kabob dinner. Firstly, the rice portion is huge, which is a big plus. The tandoori chicken was good and had nice flavor. Everything was pretty good. Nothing spectacular but still satisfying.  Restaurant is clean, lots of seating. Can be a bit cold inside."}
{"text":"I like this place. Not really into kabobs or anything but this place is good.   The portions are big for a good price. I went during the day on a weekend and everything was freshly made. Really surprised at how fresh were the kabobs, rice and salad.   It also came with some Pita on the side.  Great place and I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the MEAT.  I've been here like 5 times and whatever meat I've tried has always been incredibly juicy and always cooked to perfection.  The bad stuff:  The place is usually jam packed with people, and they appear to have brought their entire family.  If dining with children bothers you, I wouldn't come here.  If you've arrived here you likely came by car. Parking can be a royal pain in the ass.  My first time I waited approximately 7 minutes while a guy attempted to back his car out of the only available spot.  He'd come out very slowly, just a foot or two, then pop back in like a prairie dog.    Each time I've found the tables to be littered with the previous tenants food detritus, and washrooms that needed attention.    Lastly, don't order a salad of any type here. This place is all about rice, bread and meat.  The food is fantastic, but is it worth all the rubbish you have to go through to get at it?"}
{"text":"Got Choppan this time and it was delicious!  The naan with the spicy sauce provided was delicious, as was the rice. I guess I just had a bad batch last time or something, because I was way more impressed by the food this time around. I'd order here again for takeout next time I'm in the area!!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to recommend this place to all my friends ever since the first time I tried it because it's SOOOOOOOOO good.  My favourite is the saltani kabob dinner, the beef is so juicy and tender.  The tandoori chicken dinner is very good too as the chicken is so tender.  I go here about 2-3 times a month and can't ever get bored of it."}
{"text":"I work in the area and visit Bamiyan about once a week. Very good food, portions are large and prices are reasonable. Servers aren't particularly personable, but that's not what I'm going there for.  I've tried most of their chicken/beef dishes and wasn't disappointed once. Their rice is excellent and doesn't taste generic like in other similar joints. Salads taste fresh and sauces are quite tasty as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"You know there is only so many good things you can say about this place, and they have all already been said, and because of these reviews I made myself go all the way in the east end to try them out and they are GOOD.   Here are a few cons about the place though: -Don't even go for the Kabul rice, not worth the price as it hardly tastes anything close to the real deal -Avoid going on the weekend! Really I cannot insist on this enough. -Parking is a drag, read point above.  -There is not much else in the area worth visiting.   And now the best part is they've opened another location on Airport and Derry, much much closer for me so that's where I'll be going on my next trip!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure coming here. Food is good and portions are huge!! It's a cafeteria style restaurant where you place your order, wait, then seat yourself wherever available. The wait for your food seems like forever when you're hungry but it's so worth the wait! I come back every time I'm craving kebabs."}
{"text":"Best Kabob in town hands down! It's not even a competition. (PS. Bamiyan is a town in Afghanistan. No, they don't serve okra here)  This is a self service restaurant. You look at the menu and it's nothing but Kabob. I ordered the Kefta Kabob and it came with a side of salad and nan (picture below). Kabob was fresh and delicious. Haven't had such quality Kabob in a long while. Nan was hot and fresh. I tried my friend's tandoori chicken and I strongly recommend that too. Service was quick and friendly. Restaurant is very spacey. Spotless clean. Fancy decor.  A must try for anyone in the area. I will surely come back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent taste, generous portions and good prices!  Dropped in for a quick bite today and after ordering your food you take a seat until they call your number.   Food came hot, fresh and tasty! I opted for the Kofta kebab dinner and naan. The naan was heavy looking but taste was great and delish!   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I used to spend a lot of time in Ottawa and really missed Salang Kabob; I accidentally stumbled into Bamiyan Kabob and was not disappointed.   I would highly recommend the food here!"}
{"text":"The good: - food is prepared on the spot - naan is warm and delicious - great kabob - they have doogh - very clean   The bad: - no credit card"}
{"text":"Can't rate the experience! The place allows for ordering the food and then when you get it, you find yourself a seat. There is plenty of tables and everything looks neat and clean.The food looked great, the smell was wonderful. I was already enjoying the Sultani Kabob I was going to eat...  If you are from the US you will need Canadian cash to eat! No credit card, and the US debit card  will not work. We got in with a crew 7, the first two started ordering their food, when the time to pay came we got very, very embarrassed in front of quite a crowd."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Chicken breast meal is consistently good.  The meal comes with the rice, salad, bread (naan) and a hot spicy doing sauce.  The chicken is tender every time we've visited and the bread is nice and warm.  The rice is the long grain type.  Their other meals are okay but every time we come we order the chicken breast.  They only accept cash or debit, no credit cards."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and love this place!  The kabobs are big and surprisingly tender and moist.  The bread is warm and complements the dishes well.  The spicy tomatoes sauce is tangy and not too spicy.  I've tried a number of dishes and most of them are quite good.  The mango slushy is good and not watered down with ice..  Over all a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night and found the place packed. The menu doesn't have any descriptions but you can find them on their website. Might be faster then asking them what each one is.  Tried the sultani kabob dinner. Comes with mounds of rice so beware but the meat was delicious and not dry. Salad was tasty and the naan was decent with the included sauce.  There's lots of seating for groups but I found the place kind of smokey and noisy."}
{"text":"Love, love the food here! Prices are reasonable and portions are generous. Chicken is always moist and very flavourful. I've tried many dishes here and nothing disappoints :)"}
{"text":"Their chapli kabob is my favorite. We have been to this place for quite sometime now and its always the same taste. In fact we tried different locations as well, we find its always consistent."}
{"text":"Haven't had much Afghani food in my life, but WOW this place is great. I highly recommend the lamb and the tandoori chicken.   You get amazing long grain rice and tangy salad with tomatoes with all the basic meals. Not to mention a very large piece of Afghan bread which is so delicious.  All in all, its a great little variety all in one meal and the price is great for the portion size. If you've never had Afghani before, I would kind of describe it as kind of like greek food, but with indian flavors. But really its a unique cuisine all to its own.  I can't recommend this place enough. I could eat here 3 meals a day. So fresh and so filling. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Been to this Bamiyan location often, feel it's the best in the GTA. Meat is cooked properly, large clean dining room, portions for the dinner plates are very generous. Chopped tomato salad with the kabobs is excellent!"}
{"text":"Like any other Bamiyan Kebab it carries the same menu. What sets it apart is large seating environment and fairly quick service. Washrooms are clean and employees do whats required to keep the service at point. Best place to eat in The Great Punjab Plaza."}
{"text":"This location is not too far from my work so we sometimes go for lunch. Usually take-out because the place gets quite busy during lunch hour. My fav is the Tandoori Chicken Kabob wrap. Way too many onions in my opinion but still delicious."}
{"text":"Grilled meat with piles of carbs would be the best way to describe my meal at Bamiyan, in case you're unsure that's a good thing.   I recently came here for dinner; I've been meaning to try out this chain of restaurants but did not get a chance until now. After a day of last minute Christmas shopping my body needed some quick and wholesome nourishment. Bamiyan is essentially a fast food place; you walk in, order at the counter and wait for your number to be called. On this occasion I opted for the barg kebab meal (chunks of filet mignon), my meal arrived fairly quickly and was clearly cooked to order. My meal included a single skewer of meat, a large mountain of rice, a side salad, a naan, and a small container of spicy sauce, for $12 tax in (with no drink) this was quite the bargain. My favourite part of the meal was the rice; it was perfectly cooked and very buttery, absolutely delicious. The beef was A-OK, it was nicely seasoned and had a nice smoky taste from the grill, and the beef was cooked mid-well (they don't ask how you like it cooked which was disappointing). Despite the fact that it was over-cooked for my liking it was still fairly tender but a bit dry (cooking it medium-rare would do wonders). The salad was pretty sad; simply iceberg lettuce that probably came out of a bag, the naan was dry and too crispy. The accompanying spicy sauce was pretty awesome and went well with the meat, however this stuff must be precious as my small container was BARELY filled half way, what up with that Bamiyan? Maybe next time I will ask for extra sauce so I can smother my whole meal with it.   The place itself is quite nice, tiles all over give it a rustic feel and I really enjoyed the pictures of Afghani landscapes that adorn the wall. The staff was pretty friendly but the reality is they only work the counter so your interaction with them is rather limited. I have had authentic afghan food in the past and from my experience I can say that Bamiyan is good but fails to be great. All-in-all this place would be a good introduction into the cuisine but it certainly isn't the pinnacle.   *This would be a great lunch option if you are in the area"}
{"text":"It's been about 5 months since I've visited this location, but my family had an absolutely dismal experience dining here tonight.  My mother had the kofta kabob dinner with undercooked meat, led her to suffer food poisoning, throwing up on the way home... Yikes! They sent the plates back to the kitchen for a new batch, but with the same result. 2nd plate came back with the meat charred on the outside, but undercooked in the middle.   The cooks here need to be schooled on kitchen safety and the danger of serving undercooked meat to customers, inexcusable and reckless for a chain known for serving very good food. Measures on proper customer service is also in order here. Simple \"yes, yes thank you\" is not enough.   I've dined at Bamiyan Kabob more times than I can count, very disappointing. I am pissed enough to call the Public Health office who hand out food licenses."}
{"text":"Was at the Highway 7 and East Beaver Creek location on Labour Day, chapli kabob cooked perfectly! My girlfriend and I dined in for a chapli kabob dinner next day at the Thorncliffe location, very unhappy with the service. Meat was undercooked, pink in the center. Sent the dish back, asked for well done only to have the second one comeback still pink meat. The cook assigned in the grill should be more experienced, she wanted to lecture me about pink beef being okay to eat, well not for my pregnant girlfriend It's not! Very careless, this is one of my favourite places to dine, but starting to sour on me now."}
{"text":"I have been the customer of this restaurant for over 7 years! This place has always had extremely consistent and perfect food. I have tried numerous items over the years, from Chaplea kabab to Kofta and chicken breast kabob. All have been excellent.  This place has also had excellent and very reasonable pricing for the incredible fresh food they serve.  I had lunch here today after several months and excellent tasty minced meat and fresh salad and dough (yogurt drink).  Where in Toronto can you get such excellent quality food for under $10???"}
{"text":"Bamiyan Kabob is AMAZING! The food there is great, and there's a bunch of really tasty things at Bamiyan Kabob! After you finish of your meal, don't hesitate to get some Firnee, as it is completely spectacular! It finishes off the meal just right! One of my most favourite restaurants, it deserves 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Good food, I like afghani food, but love their spicy sauce/salsa.  it's always crowded.  so the order always takes minimum 30 mins to prep.  I am not sure on pricing, but I think for about 8 or 9 plates of dinner it costs $150.  1 plate can easily be split for 2 kids. 1 dinner is big enough to feed a hungry Man ;) or 2 females.  I never finish my plate all at ones.  Do not leave food over night to eat next day, it leaves the stales smell, I think it's the salad, but rice and meat smell fine."}
{"text":"We came here to see if it had a good bite to eat... I WAS RIGHT!! I GOT THE KABOB plate...it tasted great.my mom had the chaplie kabob...let's just say she wasn't to happy!! When I went up to get my food I SAID \"HI\" he replied\" WHAT DO U WANT\"  who does that... he was a B@#%h. The place was very clean and good looking. THAT GUY MESSED UP MY DINNER"}
{"text":"Love the convenient parking at this restaurant. The food is great and the staff are very helpful and polite. The restaurant is also very clean. The only downside is they only take cash or debit card, otherwise I would've give them 5 stars. I would also like to suggest to them that they should consider putting in more chairs and tables in the middle section of the restaurant to allow more accommodations for the large volume of eat-in customers on the weekends. I am going to bring my friends to eat at this place soon, and I will definitely dine at this place when I'm too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Amazing! Was so impressed, so delicious and delightful, great food overall that was absolutely mouth-watering and flavourful and well done, great job Bamiyan you guys got the best food in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love the Barg Kabob  It is the only thing I have ever ordered and I will probably not try anyhting else  Naan is not always the greatest as sometimes was hard as a rock and sometimes soft as expected.  Good food, great location though to be quite honest it does not stand out from other Kabob places in the least which caused me to change my four to a three"}
{"text":"When you're in this neck of the woods, your dining options are limited.  If you have Muslim coworkers/friends, the options are even fewer.  I've been here a bunch of times, all at lunch.  Here are my random thoughts:  1. Fresh, inexpensive, tasty.  Most meals (meat, salad, naan) run about $8-9. 2. It can get very busy with long lineups 3. Not much seating for the amount of people who eat there 4. The service is SLOW, especially if you're on a power lunch and need to be back at the office 5. The salad is pretty basic, more like a small garnish 6. Meats are always super tender and yummers 7. They don't give enough of the hot sauce/seasoning on the side -- ask for an extra, it's free  Overall, I think it's a great spot for lunch in this area.  When your other options on Overlea are Popeyes, Mainsha, or some dodgy Halal Chinese restaurant -- this is an easy choice (though I love Mainsha too!)."}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple years ago, and have been steadily coming since.  Their customer service and food has been consistent.   My favourite is their kofta.  It has a nice season, not too dry, and each order comes with 2 skewers! I usually don't get the dinner (with the rice) since I never seem to finish it.  The naan is my carb and it's so good with the hot sauce they serve.  It's sour from the vinegar but spicy!! The naan is served nice and hot, and is often too big to finish!   The salad is good, lettuce is crisp and not wilted, refreshing.  I'm not sure what the dressing is, but goes well with the meal.   My boyfriend got the sultani which is one skewer or barg (steak) and one skewer of kofta.  The barg is pretty good, but I find it a little too tough for my liking.    The prices are reasonable, but they only take cash or debit.   There's no descriptions of their skewers, but they have pictures of the dishes in photo frames above the menu. A little old school touch when all businesses are going with the led monitors now a days!"}
{"text":"My family used to visit this place often, and initially when the chain was not as popular years ago the food was amazing. however over the years it's really been going downhill and doesn't seem like they care much about the quality anymore. Today when we visited had to be the worst experience yet, the meat and rice were under cooked, and the salad wasn't fresh. We all came home feeling really sick to our stomachs and felt very nauseous. would definitely say it's now one of the lower tier Afghan restaurants, there's a lot of better options out there. I hate to be writing this review but save your time and money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My first time having fast casual Afghan cuisine up in Richmond Hill (The Hill for short).  Located in the large plaza of HWY 7 & East Beaver Creek, sits this bright, large, and clean fast casual spot.  The focus of the menu is the different types of kabobs you can get (lamb, ground beef, beef tenderloin, filet mignon, and even salmon) in a dinner, lunch, or wrap size.  I ended up deciding on the sultani kabob dinner as I wanted to try the ground beef and beef tenderloin kabobs.  I enjoyed the ground beef kabob more than the beef tenderloin kabob as it had more flavour and was juicier overall.  I probably attribute this to the beef tenderloin being cooked medium-well which isn't my preferred choice.  The dinner comes with long grain rice and a salad of iceberg lettuce/chopped tomatoes/chopped onions as well as a big oval piece of naan.  Tip: Save the few bucks on the kabob dinner and get the serving without the rice (unless you are looking to carb up).  I learned that kabobs are rarely served with rice and the naan bread stands in for the rice.  I think this place is a good spot for a quick meal where the kabobs are cooked to order which is always a bonus but please be patient.  Good things come to those who wait. :-)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time because I hear everywhere that the food here is really good. I heard that the meat was dry, but my kabob was really juicy and tender! The experience was alright, only the meat was good, the rest was standard.   we went at 11:30am on a saturday and we were the only ones. heard they get really packed at dinner time. The decor is nice, colour scheme is consistent and walls feel true to the origin. This is kind of like a fast food set up where you order at the cash and you pick up your food.  I got the kofta kabob (no rice) just salad and naan, but for some reason the cashier charged me 9.49 knowing i wanted no rice. it should be 7.49? anyway, the kabobs were tender and very juicy. I appreciate that there's no skewer. I do wish though that the salad was more interesting than lettuce and chopped tomatoes. It's dressed with typical caesar dressing and cilantro. I didn't use the little red sauce because i don't like tang.   I also wish that there was something to dip my naan in. Naan is okay didn't feel very fresh- neither crispy and light nor hot and soft, it's kind of in between :/  But I do want to point out that my tray is very well presented. The dish looks just like in the picture and no lettuce or anything was hanging off my plate, kabobs were placed neatly together in the center. Points for food presentation!!  I also got the firnee). The dessert was white and creamy. A little gooey and cooling which is nice and it's actually a large cup for dessert. But the dessert seemed to be sitting there for awhile since the top had dents instead of being smooth. I wish too there was more sprinkle of cardamon and pistachios on top though, it was barely a sprinkle.  Overall, the food is alright, I'm only going to go back for the kabobs itself."}
{"text":"The food is ok, the meat a little dry and overall on the expensive side compared to other afghan places. It's really a hit and miss too, sometimes the food will be good and other times not so good."}
{"text":"Bamiyan? More like BamiYUM! YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!  I am literally salivating remembering my last meal here. I've eaten many happy and memorable meals here. For a vegetarian, there are limited options which they more than make up for in quality and outright deliciousness.  I could honestly eat the Kabilee Rice every single day and never get tired of it. It's one of the best things I've ever tasted. EVER! Your plate is literally mounded with enough (cardamon spiced?) brown basmati rice to feed a village and topped with deliciously and delicately sauteed carrots and raisins. You don't need to be a vegetarian to enjoy this ridiculously delicious dish. Everyone who I've (grudgingly!) let try it has absolutely loved it. The boulangee (a potato and herb stuffed pancake/bread) is also pure heaven.  I can't speak to the meat dishes but my friends tell me they're amazing.   The atmosphere is no nonsense. You order at the front and bring your food to your table, being careful not to trip because there's not alot of room. You'll want to get in and get out because there will be someone else waiting very eagerly for your table. Lunch time is super busy so get there early if you want a seat.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"first time in Bamiyan,great food. the chicken is guicy with rich flavour, salad dressing is light (good light,not too creamy)?rice is good, worth waiting. The restaurant is clean, worth try again in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered tandoori chicken kabob for take out. About 10$ and you get a decent portion for your buck.  The hot sauce was yummy and spicy. But had the consistency and look of tomato sauce that goes on a pizza.  The chicken was cooked and tender so you could effortlessly cut through it with the cutlery provided. Baan bread was yummy, but your could tell that it is outsourced.  Salad was kinda boring. Oh well.     It's nothing fancy, but I wouldn't mind ordering again at some point."}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant a 2 star because of their customer service. The food was good, but customer service is what brings me back, that being said I will not come back even though I enjoyed the food. I couldn't stop thinking about how the ladies at the cash handled customers.   We came in, stood in line, which wasn't a long wait, but when we went up to the register to order, we were greeted with a loud 'NEXTTTT!' hmmm not very pleasant or welcoming sorry. A 'hi how are you' would have been nice, but no she just looked at me with a straight face, no smile, nothing, not very friendly.  I understand the restaurant is busy but that's no excuse to slack on customer service. On top of that she couldn't even answer a simple question I asked but condescendingly asked if I knew what the heck I was ordering...umm let's move on before I loose my shit.   After my order was taken, me and my friend waited what seemed like forever for our food. I ordered before my friend and she got her food before me :/ ... Ten orders later we ask where is my order.. they ask their line cooks and they give us a 'stank' look like we're giving them a hard time.. Sorry I just want my food. Finally after 15-20 minutes of waiting we got our food.. no apology, nothing, not even a smile..... Are you kidding me?! Get it togetherrrrrrrrr. On top of that their dining area was not cleaned well... rice crumbs were all over the seats and the tables were cleaned very sloppy with pieces of food left over.. ew.  I'm sure there are many people that would love to take their job, if you don't like your job than don't work there. PERIOD."}
{"text":"Bamiyan Kabob serves authentic Afghani cuisine and has many locations. The food overall is good, and they have a lot of different options. I love most of their chicken dishes, however almost everything I've tried has been pretty satisfying.  Their portions are fairly large, which is always a bonus. Their prices are decent, however considering the portion sizes, you get great value.  One thing to note is that the meal preparation time is high, so on an average day/night you might have to wait. On a busy day/night, you should definitely be prepared to wait.  The restaurant itself is big, has nice decor with an Afghan ambiance. It's great for family, friends, or groups of any kind.  I would definitely return, and I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  PS- I didn't mention it in the review but Bamiyan serves halal Afghan cuisine"}
{"text":"Usually the food is great.. But i feel they should add more spice to their food.. It seems to be very bland but on the other side their chicken Qorma and firnee are horrible"}
{"text":"Man, I love Toronto! Hiding in a strip mall on Overlea, find a dingy looking restaurant that serves up fantastic, cheap kabob...be warned regardless of when you come here you'll likely be waiting for a table as this place is always overrun with people...If you're a fan of perfectly grilled spicy meat, you must try this place out...now that I've been here I need to limit how many times I go here per month :)  Take the drive out and have some kabob...if you don't own a car, borrow one or get a zipcar membership...totally worth it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE.  It's one of my fav places to eat at York.  The rice is delicious. ALL THE MEATS ARE AMAZING.  The naan is nom nom nom nom nomnomnomnomniom  I can't even..The tomato salsa thing they serve is to die for.  Eat her.e NOW."}
{"text":"Pretty good kabobs but I did get sick after so im not sure... I enjoyed the food while we were there so I might try it again.  Food: 3/5, I got the sultani kabob dinner which came with ground beef and steak skewers with rice, lettuce salad and naan. The naan didn't seem like the naans I have had before but still good.  Service: 3/5, not much service other than taking the order.  Ambience: 3/5, great big space but oddly high tables where your chest is on the same level as the food.  Price: 2/5, a bit steep pricing for almost zero service restaurant where you have to bring everything. It's like fast serve with service restaurant pricing which was odd. ($20 per person)"}
{"text":"You hungry? You wanna eat well?  You don't wanna spend a lot of money? Then get your butt over to Bamiyan Kabob, order a plate, and Ka-Bob's Yer Uncle, you got yerself a fantastic, filling meal!   I sing the praises of the tikka kabob highly: grilled to perfection, moist, and gigantic without sacrificing meat quality. My DC had the chicken breast kabob and it was similarly moist and delicious. Loved the rice and nan, too -- super fresh and perfect. Conversely, the salad isn't so great -- it consists of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes -- but on the plus side the tomatoes were ripe and the lettuce fresh and crisp. No unripe tomatoes or limp lettuce here!   The night I went, it was the evening of Eid, so it was PACKED TO THE FREAKING GILLS in there. People were practically spilling out onto the sidewalk. Long line (longer than usual, I guess), a wait for a table, and the parking lot was a madhouse. However, it's totally worth the wait. I was surprised that the food was so great given the craziness inside. It didn't matter, it was worth every minute of aggravation. Yup, it's that good."}
{"text":"Great authentic Afghan restaurant, clean and with no frills but amazing flavour and value.  I had the kabob dinner and my wife had the chicken salad plus a drink and taxes and it still came under $20 and we took half of it home.  Great place for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"it's too easy to order waaay too much food. all the dinner portions are very generous! if you can overlook the fast-food style interior, the food is actually worth a while.  this place has quality awesome middle eastern cuisine: kebob, salad, rice, salsa, and naan (?or stone baked pancake.. I have no idea what anything is called here). I never know what to get or what I have ordered there, I wish the menu can be a bit more english-speaking friendly. I just tell the guy I wanted a spicy beef dish, etc...   They only take debit or cash, so no credit cards my friends. You take your receipt and wait till they call your number. drinks have to be bought separate.   okay food quality is more like a 4-star, overall experience makes it a 3-star."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Clean environment. Food is prepared fresh and is warm. Only downside is they dont accept credit card."}
{"text":"Good food for decent price. But the place always seems to be overcrowded. The good thing about their food is the meat. It is well cooked and goes well with the rice. Only complain is, they should definitely get a bigger place."}
{"text":"One of the best fast food restaurants ever.  All the kabobs are absolutely delicious. I ordered the Kofta kabob wrap.  Loved it.  Wish we had a good Afghani restaurant similar to this in Columbus, OH.  I'm looking forward to my next visit the next time I'm in Toronto.   FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"OMG so good! I haven't been able to stay away. This location is good too because it is not as sketch as the one near york university. They have a bunch of different kabobs and dinner meals - the workers will explain what they are to you nicely if you need help. My favourite is the barg kabob dinner: it's huge chunks of steak pieces with salsa, salad and kabilee rice - I hate rice, but this type of rice is so texturized and flavourful... YUM!!!! The prices aren't bad because the portions are huge. I can split up one meal into lunch and dinner and I'll be good to go for the day. All the dinners are ranged from $10-$14 All dinners also come with freshly baked afgan naan ... I don't eat bread often but this bread is mouth watering... it's so fresh that it smells amazing and melts warmly in your mouth. Ugh. So good.  The restaurant is never busy. It's a foodcourt type of restaurant where you order and they'll call your name. However, they have very comfortable and clean seats that reminds me of some other generic restaurants like kelsey's.  I also recommend the mango smoothie!! Straight up extracted from a ripe mango. At least, that's what it tastes like."}
{"text":"Excellent flavours and very consistent quality.  My gf and I eat here all the time and highly recommend it. Best for take-out."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is my first time trying Afghan food and it def won't be my last. The area is large and spacious. The area is clean and modern. There are lots of seatings. This is a self serve style resturant where you order and pick it up your self. I ordered the tandori chicken and it was really flavourful. The chicken was super juicy as well. It came with a salad and a naan bread which was amazing. Everything was fresh and hot. It came with a brownish spicy garlicy sauce that went really well with the chicken."}
{"text":"Always get sultani dinner for take out from this location. Always tastes the same and flavours are consistent. Not the best afghani food in toronto but one the most famous ones."}
{"text":"Well this review is not about three good but about the hospitality of the staff, I visited the place, placed my order and I was told that they only take cash or debit card, I gave 100$ US and they try to rip off by not offering the conversion rate, I offered my visa/ Mastercard for debit account but still not acceptable and they aren't even apologetic about it Very bad communication and customer handling"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat ... the restaurant is clean and spacious.  I went in for lunch with my family.  We have been to the one in Markham before so we sort of know what we wanted.  I had the Choppan Kabob.  The meat was well spiced and tender with two type of salads on the side.  It was perfect for a lunch time meal.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Anyone who is fan of middle eastern cuisine will appreciate the delicious variety of meat and vegetarian options at Bamiyan Kabob.  The restaurant is large, and kept clean - you place your order at the front and the staff calls you when ready. The food takes about 10 minutes to prepare but comes out nice and fresh.  The platters are large and are served with naan, rice, salad and your choice of meat. I had the lamb while my father had the tandoori chicken. Both were tasty and flavourful, and neither of us could finish our plate. Would definitely recommend the dinner or even one of their many wraps which I've had on a previous occasion."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just my palette but I was not too thrilled about the lamb dish I had chosen. The lamb was very I've cooked. Possibly I'll revisit to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"I've eaten Afghan food in various places in the states, Canada, and Afghanistan. This one certainly ranks right up there for the kabobs and rice. Tender meat, plenty of it, and all for a rather low price (considering the portion size), Bamiyan is certainly a place you can go and get your fill.  Use the hot sauce for your meats and ask for the \"white sauce\" (yogurt blend) for your bread and salad. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious.  Ordered the choppan (lamb) kabob and it definitely filled me up.  I would have liked more lamb in the order, but their was plenty of delicious rice, salad, and Naan bread!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times with friends.. on the first visit, got the mantu. They had a lot of potential to be delicious but were served cold. It's a pretty oily/fatty dish, so serving it cold is not acceptable. Another time I tried the salmon, my friend shared some chicken with me and it really all tasted the same. The spices are strong, and while they go very well with chicken, they completely overpowered the salmon. For me personally, not my favourite blend of spices, but my friends love it, so it really depends on the customer's taste.   The restaurant is clean, self-serving."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far.  Once sit-in and the other take-out.  One word: DELICIOUS!  Their kabobs are to die for.  The flavoring of the rice is out of this world.  I love the naan too.  Even the girls behind the counter are very courteous and friendly.  If I could, I would order from here at least once or twice a week."}
{"text":"Clean, affordable, and tasty - it's a winner.  Had the tikka beef lunch with green salad, tomato/onion salad, and Afghani naan (a much thicker, breadier version of Indian naan) - which was a good portion.  Salads were nice, and the meat was juicy and tender.  It's plenty of food for most, though a few guys had the 'dinner' (ie. same as lunch, but with addition of rice) and managed to find room to get it down.  Also had the mango smoothie - nice, cool, and refreshing, if you don't mind a bit of sugar.  All in all, a nice place, spacious, relatively quick service (order then wait for your number to be called).    My only suggestion is to have translations into English on the main menu above the order counter - we had to ask what everything was and were pointed to their paper/takeout menu to see the translations.  It would've been nice to see those written in small print somehow on the overhead menu as well."}
{"text":"Really good food, portions are pretty big. I love the mango drink and the dessert."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I am a big fan of afghani style kabobs and this place hits the spot!   The location is prime. It is surrounded by offices so it definitely gets busy at lunch. Seating is simple but they have tons of tables so usually can find a seat even if it is super busy. They only take cash or debit so keep that in mind.   The food is bombastic! I always get the tandoori chicken plate. The chicken is cooked perfectly, the rice and naan are just right, and the sauces are to die for!!!! I love the white sauce, always end up getting extra and finishing it anyways!   The customer service could be better, but I guess they are busy and do the best they can. You basically have to self serve and pick up your food from the counter, but if they are busy it gets crowded at the front so you kind of just have to listen to the numbers."}
{"text":"Delicious surprises await you if you just have the patience.  We were looking around for a quick take out joint; I don't know what the heck I was thinking of when I picked a kabob place! Nice bright and clean place with counters made with marble and archways decorated with stone.  Ordered a Tikka wrap and Salmon special to go. Waiting, waiting, waiting....then one of the staff asks for my number to follow up on my order. She was mortified when she realized she had given my order to another customer. Yeah, I could have blew up at her and made an ugly scene but that's just not my style. Everyone apologized profusely, gave me a freebie mango shake to appease me (WOOHOO) and started remaking my order.   While waiting hubby comes in (he was waiting in the car) and says we have to go. I tell them I want my money back but they assure me it's only 3 minutes left AND for my troubles they'll give me a complimentary side of rice and Firnee (Creamy homemade pudding, spiced with crushed cardamon seeds and topped with shredded pistachios).  The highlight of our meal was the Firnee; it had a smooth, creamy consistency similar to panna cotta with a delectable cardamon flavor to it. If it wasn't for their mistake I would have missed the chance to try this Afghan delicacy.  Would also recommend their reasonably priced tasty wraps (starts at $4.99) and their thick and fruity mango shake."}
{"text":"word of mouth definitely went around in my family, and we totally love this place, the food is as efficient as the service....excellent.  Though its not your quiet sit-down type of place to bring a date, its a dive to experience if you want to experience great kebobs!! ........"}
{"text":"Order at the counter and wait for your number to be called to pick up your food. Clean up after yourselves by returning food trays and disposing garbage in the bins.  First time here, first impression was: - spacious - clean - slightly disorganized with orders  I came here with a group of 7 and had no trouble finding tables to seat us all. Most of us ordered the choppan kabob dinner while some ordered the Barg kabob and grilled salmon.  The person who took our orders (we ordered separately) had a hard time understanding us. He/she also called out numbers and served food without checking the order number on receipts. Friend \"A\" went to pick up his food and was told he had 2 other trays to take with him... it was confusing. Luckily for the restaurant, my friends \"B\" and \"C\" recognized it was food that they had ordered, so they took it. If it was some other dishonest customer, who knows if they would just keep the free food?  As for my order, they didn't give me my mango smoothie until I pointed out on my bill. Disorganized!  I thought the lamb chops were too bony and not enough meat offered, so I wasn't completely full.  Either that cashier/server was new or overworked... Maybe more training is necessary.  Food was average but can be a place to visit for a quick bite with food that is served quickly."}
{"text":"Say you are shopping at East York Town Centre, and you got hungry. Skip the lacklustre crap they serve there and head across the street instead.   Although there are an array of familiar fast food, Afghan food and Halal restaurant options all along the Thorncliffe Park community, Bamiyan Kabob has become a small local chain, with locations throughout the GTA that all began at this nondescript East York plaza, all run by an Afghani family*. Regardless, it's a decent option if you're craving a quick meal in the area and a taste of the people who live and work here. The place looks basic but respectable inside--heck, the built-in-place seating are decked with granite tabletops.  Afghan style kebabs are what they do, and apparently they do one of the best in Toronto. The meats are served on its own with a side of basic salad and an Afghan naan, as a \"dinner\" which includes also a liberal dose of rice, or in a wrap. You get your receipt with an order number (important!), and then wait maybe 10 minutes-ish for your order to be called.  All orders come with a hot tomato-and-pepper salsa in a small sauce container that you can dip that crispy soft and fresh naan to, or splatter on your meat and rice. An entire \"dinner\" meal (not that you have to order it at dinnertime) is a giant serving for one person to handle, so two small stomachs should consider splitting a dish. The rice is very floor-dropping fragrant, as is their tandoori chicken. Their tikka kabobs (beef) are tender and moist and packs a good grilled flavour; a good choice for those not big on hot-and-spicy, not that Afghani food is known for being heavy on the chili (which they are not).  Perhaps next time I find myself here I'll give the chaplee kebab (the so-called 'Afghan burger', or so I am told) and their kabilee rice a bite. It's hard to complain when you get so much good filling food without spending an arm for it here before you head back to work, life, or Target across the street.  {TTC: the 25, 81 or 100 bus to the eastern Thorncliffe Park Drive stop. You'll damn well know you're at the right stop when you see the Esso fuel station at one corner.}  * The now-defunct youth newsweekly The Grid did a feature on Bamiyan Kabob, with a backstory to the chain that probably is a more enjoyable read than an average review here: http://www.thegridto.com/life/food-drink/sticking-to-it/"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD! If you enjoy Middle Eastern cuisine, comw here. Dislike the wait times for food prep."}
{"text":"My coworker asked whether I would like to give Afghan food a try and this was the restaurant my coworker recommended. Bamiyan Kabob is a fast casual Afghan restaurant with multiple locations in Toronto. I never have had Afghan cuisine before, but it felt like a fusion between Mediterranean cuisine and Indian cuisine. The menu includes various kabob meal (meat + salad + naan), wraps, and other side orders.  ***  Tandoori Chicken Kabob (chicken marinated in seasoning; CAD $12.59): Other than somewhat flavorful chicken kabob, salads and naan tasted a-okay. I definitely agree with Yelper  Erez Z. below - \"Nothing I am wowed over. The best part is the meat\". Even the spicy dipping sauce wasn't as good as I thought.  ***  It was nice to try a different cuisine once in a while and this is not a bad place to grab a quick meal, but personally I still prefer some of Mediterranean / Indian cuisines that I have had in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Great food. Had boulagnee and a tikka kabob. Boulagnee perfect for sharing and super cheap as far as appetizers go. Hard to describe, but tasty and spicy. Tikka is beef tenderloin and a great value with a sizable portion of quality tender meat. Great service."}
{"text":"I ordered all their meats and they were all amazing. Even the bread!  I highly recommend if your in the area."}
{"text":"Kofta-licious!  I always get take out because no matter what time of day you come here, it is always packed!  This reminds me of an Arbys or Harvey's or something like that in here - it looks like a hamburger joint place with it's seating.  I try to always get takeout because eating in here always makes me nostalgic for the 80s.  LOL   But oh my the food is delish!  I cannot get enough of the rice - light and fluffy and oh so flavourful.  2 kebabs, a HUGE pile of rice, salad and naan for $9...can't be beat!  In fact the portions are so huge it's usually 2 meals for me :)    Service is friendly but a little slow, but that is expected given the line ups at time"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much on the outside, but it sure is tasty.  I tried some supreme platter, that had 2 different kinds of beef kabob.  Both were tasty.  I sadly couldn't finish my meal on my own, but luckily was with a couple of DC's who could help me out. I liked the rice and the salad.  For some reason when I have kabobs, I really want tzaziki even when it's not souvlaki, but that's just a thing.  The wrap probably would have been a better choice, just due to portion size.  Their mango smoothies are delish.  You can also get this salsa-ish looking dip which they are not stingy about giving out.  Enjoy!  It's yummy here, but come hungry!"}
{"text":"I love the kofta combo. There is a good amount of rice and salad. The bread is delicious when it's fresh and hot.  The lamb is a hit and miss depending on the location. I personally don't like it charred."}
{"text":"I went to this place for take out Sunday night. There was no line up or anything so I ordered chicken breast plate and was told to wait 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, my order wasn't still ready and cashier asked me what my number was since I was the only person waiting for take out. I told her it was 265 and she told me my order would be ready in a few minutes. Then she called out the number 266, which was an eat- in order with three plates, two of which  are the same as mine. I asked the cashier again about my order and she told me by pointing the grill  in the kitchen it was coming out shortly. I asked  her why she served the number 266 before me and she gave me the same answer. I asked her to give my money back because this is not something I could tolerate. During my stay, I noticed that kitchen staff lacked seriousness of the job as well. Very poor service. It was my first time to taste their food and was also the last time. If their food is the same as their service, I consider myself lucky."}
{"text":"I simply love their food! Check out their menu for a wide variety of kabobs with salad, naan and rice. Especially enjoy their tandoori kabob with their special rice that is  topped with carrots. If you haven't tried them, you simply must!"}
{"text":"The foods are really good.. it is greatly spiced... I like the sultani dinner... Aryan is ok.. they only accept cash or debit, no credit cards.."}
{"text":"I used to go to the airport road location for years as it was always consistent and super tasty, but for the past 1.5 years I started going to this Keele location and I now find its been just as good! My husband and I always get the tandoori chicken dinner that comes with super tasty tandoor chicken breast pieces, a decent amount of salad, a generous portion of seasoned long grain (or basmati?) rice and a freshly made bread-like naan. Exquisite! We've also ventured and started trying a boulganee (seasoned potatoes stuffed roti or naan)- there is something so comforting and delicious about this app/dish. 8-10 hand sized triangular pieces and a side of a cold yogurt sauce for you to dip in! Yum!  The portion sizes of everything is generous, 1 or 2 person can eat from each order and if your is made by a tall man named John- then your set! This is a weekly dinner spot"}
{"text":"The best take out, the best food. Such good value for your money and the taste of food is incredible. My children are in love with the long grain rice they use here and the firni! I can say (since we've been to this location and order here often) that we've tried all the dishes on the menu. We love all the dishes, the only dish I'm not a fan of is the lamb, but that's due to taste preference. Their newest dish mantou is also fabulous."}
{"text":"Delicious food and not too exotic for non-adventurous types.  I tell them if they like Greek, they'll find the chicken kabobs, rice and salad a good option. It comes with Afghani naan, only slightly different from Indian naan.  My favourite is the Tikka (beef kabob) dinner. The salsa is delicious for dipping the meat or bread, or even adding to the rice. It's crazy busy on Fridays, so be prepared for a wait or order ahead."}
{"text":"People really like this place too much. I think it's pretty plain and boring in terms of spice and it's very pricey too. I really dislike the rice since it has no flavor at all. Nothing too special and extremely busy all the time."}
{"text":"Chaotic, loud, confusion describes this place well. This is a fast food joint that is everything else BUT fast. However behind the smog(literally) lies the haven for kabob fanatics. The kabobs are fragrant, tender and juicy with a nice char-grilled flavour. The naan is deliciously doughy and light. Service is painfully inefficient and the atmosphere is confusing but you should kick yourself if you pass this place by. Elephant size portions for the price. Worthy of many many revisits."}
{"text":"I've only ever got take out from here. I've never actually seen the place, as someone else has always done the picking up. In my head, I assume the restaurant is all magic and meat. The food  here is amazing. This has to be one of the better kabob places in the city. (I believe it's Afghani style.)  There are two things you must order if you go here. The first are the Chaplee, which are circular kabobs. They are brilliant. The second is the Boulagnee, which looks like bread but is actually potato. It's so fucking good. My god.  The prices are wicked low. You can feed a ton of people for next to nothing.  I'd give this place 5 stars, but I feel like I should actually sit in the restaurant first."}
{"text":"Very Delicious Afghani food! Must Try!"}
{"text":"I could eat at different locations of Bamiyan Kabob and know that I will be getting exactly what I expect. :) Delicious ness!   I almost always get the chicken kabob with rice because the chicken has always been moist (literally never had a dry chicken yet.. can't say the same for beef or lamb though sadly). The rice is so delicious and I really enjoy the salad and the slightly hot tomato salsa that comes with each dish. I could pour that salsa on everything!!!   The bread they serve (the roti/naan) is always warm and fresh and they are extremely generous with their portions which feeds the guys perfectly!!!!   This is a solid choice if you're looking for food done right!"}
{"text":"My family actually quite likes this place. It's a good value for a decent portion size. I think sometimes, the meat is either a good amount, or quite little.. so I wish there was more portion control there. The smaller meat pieces tend to be really dry and tough.. But... everything else does taste great and I love the spicy little salsa they give you. It's tangy and spicy and just adds a level of freshness to the meal.   The staff here are really nice and quite patient for first timers who don't know what's what. They have adequate seating and most people here just eat and go.   For a chain restaurant, this is not bad :) I would recommend it if you're looking for a quick bite! The chicken dishes are great and the kabobs. I would not be likely to order the lamb again cause they were really small and over cooked pieces each time we ordered it. But the chicken gets a big thumbs up. I've yet to have a dry piece of chicken so maybe it's just my luck."}
{"text":"Service is good and food is ALWAYS good! I ALWAYS get the chicken dinner and i LOVE their sauce on the side.  I make sure to get extra. Lol  Anyways, would def recommend"}
{"text":"Great food love the sultani kabob and salsa !!! Very busy there's always a huge line up and hardly any place to sit , limited sitting. But overall great food"}
{"text":"Hands down, tastiest chicken and meat you will eat is here. Their bread is to die for, and service is great, you never wait longer than 7-10 minutes. LOVE IT."}
{"text":"This is one of the new locations which opened near my area. I went to it once to check the place out and give it a try. I have been going there since then. As the food is very good quality. I will say they have once of the beat kababs around the area. Place is very good with nice washrooms. Just make sure in washroom some customers wet napkins for some weir reason not sure y. So will recommend this place to anyone around the area."}
{"text":"Lovely place the space is large and nice. The washrooms in the place are good no complain clean nice and good. The food is the best of all the things . kofta kabab was amazing cheap and beat kabab I tried around this area. I have already been here two days in a raw the people working are very friendly and nice."}
{"text":"Highly recommedeed The Kabobs were always perfect,  have never been disappointed with the food when there."}
{"text":"I was really craving Afghan cuisine, me and it had been separated for far too long. I gave in and didn't go to Afghan cuisine to see if Bamiyan Kabob was really worth the hype.   At 4pm, there was no line but I think there were 3-4 orders before mine so not bad. Decor was decent, nothing special. Lots of tables available. As with most Afghan restaurants, you order and pay at a counter and they will call you when the food is ready.  I ordered the chicken breast kabob dinner to go. Portion is on par with other restaurants in the area. Price point ($12.15) was on par if not slightly more expensive. The wait from order to pick up was 20 minutes but you could see they were busy in the kitchen.  The food itself had a bit more bite than I'm used to and a 'minor' detail, the spice was unevenly spread on only one side of the chicken and one end had way more spice than the other. Aside from that, it was juicy and delicious. The accompanying salad and rice were pretty good and nicely flavoured.   All in all, when given the option I would prefer going back to Afghan cuisine. Not as busy and the food is just as delicious!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken tandoori dinner. It was missing the sauce, which left the meal super dry. Chicken was okay.   The staff also comes off rude. There was no cuttlerly with my meal. I would avoid going to this particular location.  Very upset about my missing sauce."}
{"text":"This place recently opened up next door to the Pita Pit that my co-workers seem to love, as it seems exotic to them and figuring why not make a change of pace I decided to pop in. The whole restaurant is brand new and all together nicely dressed though possibly a little clinical. The place seemed empty and overstaffed, especially for a counter service restaurant. I stared at the menu board above the counter until I was dizzy trying to figure out what I wanted and eventually came to the conclusion of Choppan Kabob dinner ($11.99).  I was given the number 41 and returned to my seat until it was called. The meal that lay before me was salad and rice saddled next to each other with 3 lamb chops laid across the rice, in a separate basket was the 'naan'. I dug into the lamb first, it was a little dry and over cooked but with decent seasoning. The salad was chopped iceberg lettuce with what tasted like a light-ranch dressing and as tasty as described. The 'naan' seemed to be pizza dough rolled out and stabbed with a fork and tossed into a pizza oven, it was dry and unflattering to the meal. The rice was a brown basmati rice cooked to perfection though lacking seasoning. Over all the meal was mediocre at best and I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can adequately communicate my feelings about Bamiyan Kabob with words, so I'm going to resort to making clichéd noises associated with food enjoyment:  omnomnomnom.  There was a lot of food. It was spicy, and maybe a tad bit on the greasy side but whatevs. The naan was really good. The curry was really good. The kabobs were dandy. The portions were good. The service was excellent. Everything was above average.   If I remember correctly, I couldn't use my credit card though... I don't have one of those fandangled Interac cards so that proved to be a little inconvenient, and my Canadian dinner companion had to jump in.   It took a while to get the food though. Other than that... please refer to the \"omnomnomnom\" bit up there."}
{"text":"As usual the Bamiyan Kabob does not disappoint. This time I had take- out, and at from the square styrofoam container. The humongous meal seems to be smaller when jammed into the take-out containers. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavour and quantity of the meal I ordered. (I highly recommend the Sultani Kabob, which is half filet mignon and half beef kofta)   The salad is always flavourful and the naan is fresh, crunchy, and warm. I always love eating at Bamiyan Kabob and highly recommend anyone to try it."}
{"text":"Good portions with a LOT of rice. The meat was cooked quite well-I opted of the Sultani Kabob dinner which was plenty of meat. There is quite a bit of starch here with the rice and the bread, but then again...that's part of the experience. It does not look busy at all, even on a weekend night. Would return to try the tandoori chicken which others have written much about."}
{"text":"Good food, good quality, long line ups.   Food was excellent. Prices were 'ok' at best depending on a lot of factors. Service though - while they were on top of things, I still found it to be lacking. Maybe it's my high expectations but maybe it was because of the fly's flying around the restaurant. More pest control please!"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after years of seeing it driving home.   I arrived in the late afternoon, and it was a mad house. I'm not sure if it's always this packed and crazy or maybe because it was Mothers Day, but after my meal I can see why there are repeat customers.   I stood there for a bit looking at the menu but I had no clue what each meal was made out of. I had to ask some people in the line if they could kindly explain each dish and to excuse my ignorance.   I decided to go for the Sultani Kebob Meal ($12.52), which came with the meat, rice, side salad and Afghan Naan. All I can say is Amazing! The food took a while to prepare, but at least I knew it was fresh and just cooked, not sitting under a hot light bulb. The meat is well seasoned, the rice and salad were a great compliment, and the naan was fresh and superb. I'm hoping to try the rest of the menu items in the future.   For my beverage, I ordered the Mango Smoothie - fresh and delightful treat for a hot day. This is a great place to bring friends and family, but be prepared to wait for a seat and your order. This has a fast-food type atmosphere where you order your food and find a place to sit, but loyal patrons come and fill the place up.  Great place, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I felt like trying something new and Afghan food fits into that category for me. A friend of mine recommended this place a while back so it's been on my list for a while.  It was quite busy when we arrived but we quickly figured out that we had to order at the counter and wait for our number to be called. The menu posted on the wall had the names of the dishes but no description. The few pictures helped but, luckily, there was another menu taped to the counter near the cash register that had descriptions.  I chose the Choppan Kabob (Lamb chops mildly marinated in different spices) and both of my dining companions chose the Chicken Kofta Kabob (chicken breast and lean ground beef marinated in our seasoning). I'll have to educate them on the art of ordering different dishes. We found a vacant table and waited for our number to be called.  It took about 15 minutes but it was worth the wait. The portions were very generous and the food was very well seasoned and cooked. The lamb chops ,might have been overcooked by most standards but I actually like mine medium well and it was tender. The chicken and beef were also seasoned well, tender, and moist. Salad and naan were included, although this naan was more like a flatbread, a little heavier than Indian or Pakistani naan. Good, but different.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal and will definitely return. My rating would have been higher if the menu was more descriptive and they had table service."}
{"text":"Delicious Afghani kabob and other dishes! Used to frequent the Mississauga location when I worked in the area. The food is amazing with quick service and plenty of seating in a very nice modern dining area. The portions are generous and each dinner comes with a large naan and salad. Love it!"}
{"text":"This is my fave place to go for kabob.  The place itself is very spacious and clean.  As long as you time your visit,  before or after the lunch or dinner rush hours, you will be pleased. It gets really busy during lunch and dinner, proof that good food knows no racial boundaries.  This is where you will see different backgrounds with the same goal1 savouring the mouthwatering grilled meats. I love the flavours of the tandoori chicken.  Dinner comes with a huge naan bread,  salad,  tomato,  onion and parsley side and a spicy dipping sauce.  Each and every time I visit this place,  im always content and happy. The feerni is a light dessert,  must try. Writing this review now made me crave for it."}
{"text":"Food was tasty, but not awesome. More like a fast food experience. It's self serve at the counter, with lots of place to sit. No vibe or atmosphere. I can't see myself going again.  This place is better suited for a food court than a destination restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is very good not the fastest service but the food is fresh. First time I went there it took about 20 minutes to get a wrap the second time it only took 15"}
{"text":"If you don't mind long lines but great food then this is the place to go. I ordered the half chicken kabob and was surprised about hiw much food I got; i am a big portions guy and this place is worth the waiting. Will come back again for sure!   I would recommend the Sultani Kabob and the Half Chicken Kabob (both come with rice, salad, and naan bread)"}
{"text":"When I think of Bamiyan I think of juicy meaty garlicky goodness. The dinners come with a huge side of rice, salad, flatbread and this amazingly flavourful salsa that is both tangy and spicy.   I like this location because it's clean and not crazy busy (or maybe I'm just always there at odd hours?). I also really like the fact that they're generous with their portions..I usually have enough left over for second dinner (woo..second dinner!). Really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I ordered the lamb and the it was slices of lamb bone in. Just the right amount spices and portion was spot on. Only complaint (minus) one star is the speed of the service . Took around 20 mins for the food. Looks like we order mid way and got food last. They servers all the smaller orders first. Naan was freshly made but I would prefer Indian style naan  because it's much thinner and lighter.   Second visit: We have order four dinner meals and the service was horrible and food is terrible. Take us 8 minutes to wait to order food. Took another 19 minutes to receive our food. The kabob were overcooked and dry. The disposal area of all plates and utensils were very dirty"}
{"text":"I had this place and Afghan Kabab bookmarked so when we found ourselves hungry and driving by, we quickly pulled in and consulted the photos on Yelp for both places. My wife decided the photos for Bamiyan looked better so in we went. The place was packed. All the tables were taken and there was a crowd at the counter waiting for their food. We knew we'd made the right choice. The line to order was surprisingly short, giving us just enough time to settle on the kofta & chicken kabab dinner and the barg kabab dinner.   After the 30 people ahead of us got their food, we got ours. It was worth the 20+ minute wait. The chicken breast was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy. Ditto the kofta. The filet mignon was juicy and flavorful. All meats were perfectly spiced, and not at all salty. The basmati rice was also flavorful and spicy w/o being hot. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food, 0 stars for the customer service.  They messed my order up and gave me a blank receipt.  I got this look from the two girls who worked the counter like it was my fault that one of them gave me an empty receipt.  When they called my number, and gave me my order, I said that I was supposed to have nan-bread as well.  The girl had this blank expression on her face and said, \"Yeah, i know.\"  She then proceeded to toss the nan basket onto my tray.  I guess I can understand the attitude.  It's up to the customer to get their order right, right?  The place was packed, seating was really hard to come by.  The previous review about crying babies and no queue system was spot-on.  The saving grace for my experience was the food.  The salad was nothing special, but the rice and the meat were made really well.  I tried my friends dishes and those were also great.  We had the chicken, lamb and beef, all cooked perfectly.  2 stars overall, I'd need some serious convincing to come back here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great place for a quick meal or takeout. Meats are always tasty and juicy. Portions are very big."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's near my work and I try to suggest coming here any time my colleagues suggest we go out for lunch. For lunch, arrive early to avoid the lunch crowd because it does get busy!  Bamiyan serves Middle Eastern food. Their menu is quite straight forward with a selection of lunch/dinner plates that consists of meat kebab(s), salad and/or rice. There are also wraps and salad options. The food is fresh, flavourful and portions here are huge! Prices are very decent for the quality and quantity of food.   Ambience wise, the restaurant offers cafeteria style seating.  Nothing special but at least it is clean. You order at the counter and pick up your meal at the counter when it is ready. I'm docking a star because the wait time for food can be 15-20mins which is unfortunate since I only get an hour lunch! The level of customer service provided is limited since it is mostly self serve.   All in all, for the food, price and quality/quantity, this is one of my go to places for lunch. Just be weary if you dine in; due to the openness of the seating area, and it's proximity to the kitchen, you end up smelling like the food!"}
{"text":"In terms of Afghani food, this is definitely one of the TOP places I've been to - the Kofta Kabob is an excellent choice, but you can't really go wrong with the food here...!  Not the classiest or nicest restaurants, but definitely a must go if you want to savor some authentic Middle Eastern cuisine :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazinggggg I actually don't have anything bad to say about it. The food is really good quality from the rice, to the chicken/beef and they also serve you with salad to go along with everything to keep that healthiness goin lol. The serving portions are really big too so you get filled up for sure and they give bread with your food which is super fresh everytime. The eating area is gigantic so dont worry bout not getting room to sit. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, I always order the barg kabob. Good family atmosphere, but it can get really noisy"}
{"text":"I love the kabobs here and the dinner portion size is big enough to feed two people (Naan! Rice! Salad! Huge kabobs! All one one meal!). I usually order the Sultan to eat both the Kofta (beef) and chicken kabob. The only problem with this location is that they are very slow due to the overwhelming amount of take out orders they receive. I've waited more than 30 minutes for my meal before - and this is for an informal eat in place!"}
{"text":"This modern strip mall place is immaculately clean and the flame broiler and kitchen are clearly visitble.  Menu is limited primarily to grilled items - it does not reflect the full range of Afghan cuisine which is too bad as I don't think there are many more Afghan places in the GTA.  However, everythng is delicious.  The rice is especially good and all the grilled items were very tasty and was the delicious afghan bread.  Counter service but food is cooked to order, so not a fast food place."}
{"text":"If you want great Afghan food, you must go to Bamiyan kabob and Kandahar Kabob.   Try their chapli kabob and rice & Tikka Kabob. They bake fresh Naan."}
{"text":"Unpretentious and relatively fast, I come to Bamiyan whenever I have a craving for simple and delicious Afghani food. You order up front and get seats yourself, but depending on the time of day, there can be fairly long line ups and few seats. Portions are usually quite large but I've noticed that they have reduced the amount of food within the last couple of years. I'm still completely full at the end of the meal but only pack home half of what I used to bring home.   What to Expect:  Good: Juicy Kebabs (my personal favourite is the Chicken Kofta dinner because you get two types of meat), flavourful rice and soft naan  Meh: The side salad is just your typical iceberg lettuce with tomatoes, and you may need to go up to the counter to get your own utensils, water, etc.   Price: If you don't get rice, expect to pay ~$8-11 for kebabs, salad, and naan. For the full dinners, it'll be around ~$10-14. If you're with friends, you can always buy sides and share."}
{"text":"Overall the food is not bad. However They can hire someone be more professional. My bf ordered beef and chicken, the cashier said they didn't have this. In fact his friends was eating beef and chicken. Then she gave out the wrong order to other customer. Luckily boss realized it was their mistake."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I've never had any issues with the food or service. The restaurant is clean and the staffs are always friendly whenever I come in.  The portion size of each platter are big and I've always had leftovers to eat for the next day.  I've tried a variety of their kabobs and so far they have all tasted good! The dinners I usually order comes with naan bread and they taste great with the sauces. I personally like the chaplee kabob which comes with two pieces of meat that look like a bigger version of hamburger patties. They are easy to chew and is very flavourful. I have also tried their soft dumplings which is called the \"Mantoo.\" It is a very colourful dish and it comes with 9 large pieces. There's a lot of toppings/ingredients that come with the dish so there is a lot going on when you take the first bite. Nonetheless, it is a great dish to try if you love to eat dumplings as they do offer a taste that is different to Chinese dumplings. The mango slush is also a must try if you are ever there."}
{"text":"No taste to the lamb and is chewy and vet very lean! Bread is not made in house and is boring and stale without flavour  Boring rice Boring salad I go out to eat to have tastier food than I can produce at home. Found myself needing to add sauce and salt and pepper.  Everything all round was bland and unappealing."}
{"text":"Fantastic food always! Open late and great service.  A few seats around if you'd like to sit in though I've always called in and picked up. The lamb and beef skewers are fab!"}
{"text":"There are many high reviews here and after eating here I will agree that this probably is the best kabob place around and it does deserve all the high praise. The service is excellent, the place is clean and nicely furnished. The kabobs themselves are huge and juicy and could easily feed two people from one dish as the portions of everything is massive.  Ordered the following: chicken and kofta kabob dish $12.50 kofta kabob dish $9.49  Both meals come with rice, salad, naan, kabobs and some kind of dipping sauce. The dipping sauce itself is hard to describe. It looked like tomato paste but tasted nothing like it. The sauce tasted sour, vinegary with a bit of heat. I didn't really like it.   I was confused how to eat the naan since I usually eat it with some kind of dipping sauce like curry but I just ended up eating it with the meat. I also usually eat kabobs with sour cream so it always felt there was something missing. So like Corey R said already its like a fusion of Indian with the naan and Greek with the kabobs.   Overall, everything was excellent but its not my cup of tea or not the type of food I usually enjoy eating. I give it a 3 star rating but I know it deserves higher."}
{"text":"This place is one of my family's go to places when it comes to eating out. We don't normally dine in though because the place is usually busy during dinner time. We always get the chicken kabob dinner, comes with a generous amount of brown rice, salad (tomatoes, onions, lettuce), & about 8 pieces of chicken kabob. Sooooo good, especially when you eat it with their hot sauce. Their hot sauce isn't really the typical hot sauce, more like a vinaigrette consistency but makes anything on their menu better. The dish is enough to share between two people, at least. It is a good deal for $13.49.   Their chicken kabob wrap is also really good, it consists of everything in their dinner tray except for the rice. The wrap is a really good size & can easily be eaten in two different sittings. The hot sauce is already inside the wrap, however, I suggest you always ask for additional on the side. It is also cheaper than the dinner & I would suggest this over the dinner. It is $6.99.  I would stay away from the seafood, very dry & not flavourful.   In general a solid place to eat. But be careful what time you go because regardless of whether you are dining in or taking out, the line is usually crazy."}
{"text":"It's 10 o'clock!!!!  PM!!!!!   Wtf????  Who eats then?  Obviously me and the rest of markham.  Line ups, people budding, rude looks and children running everywhere!  It's frigging Wednesday night!    After we finally got our dinner and found a place to sit...omg...the clouds parted and I think I saw heaven as I sank my teeth into my first ever chicken kofta kabob dinner.  The screaming children transformed into a choir of Angels and the frowns turned into smiles....oh what a great night!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Bamiyan a lot back in the day, even at the Mississauga location but it is out of the way and I know it gets really busy in there.  Good Friday and we were in the area.  Busy, yes, but there was only 2 people in front of me.  I have been here when the line-up was to the door.  We got a seat in the back easily.  I ordered the Half Chicken Kabob Dinner.  It came out within 8 to 10 minutes, not too long.  This was my usual order.  The dinner was sensational as always.  The presentation of it is picture perfect.  The tandoori chicken was absolutely delicious.  It came in four pieces: thigh, breast, wing and leg.  Delicious with every bite.  It was juicy, flavourful and tender.  It was not fall of the bone soft but it was grilled just right and goes with the rice.  The salad with the dressing is one of my favourite parts of the dinner.  It is tasty and the lettuce is fresh and crisp.  I am not really a fan of the onion salsa mix just by preference.  The naan was a tad dark, not burnt but it was a little tough and missing the black sesame seeds.  Yup, even I noticed that but it was not a big deal.  Still good!  The dinner has the excellent combination of deliciousness.  Not spicy at all, which is the way I want it with this dish.  I love taking a bite of one part and then another and let the party continue in my mouth!  The variety of food and for the price is a cut above no doubt.  Can't wait til I go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food with super hero sized portions. We ordered the tandoori chicken and beef plates. Both dishes, at 11.95$ each, come with a mammoth helping of rice, fair sized salad, dipping sauce, naan bread the size of a watermelon and the tenderest. Juiciest meat you've had in some time. Each entree could easily feed two. The food is made fresh. You place your order and they call you by number on the receipt to pick up. There's ample seating and the space is clean and bright. Same can be said about the restrooms. We ordered mango smoothie which was tasty and refreshing. Staff are very friendly. I highly recommend the place but make sure to come hungry!"}
{"text":"Like this place but don't come often. I find that for food court style food, it is quite expensive. For 2 meals with drinks can easily come up to $30.  Food is good and delicious, but not as big portion as other places.  Overall the quality of the food is good"}
{"text":"Amazing food that is fresh and not greasy at all. Best Kabobs in GTA by far. Everything that I tried at this location is fingerlicking good. Do not forget to order this hand made bread ( I forgot the name of it ) that is stuffed with mashed potatoes. I would highly recommend this establishment for a must place to go in Markham."}
{"text":"Great flavor BBQ - a little bit on the salty side to my palate (4 of us agreed) Value for the money and reasonably priced - Big portion Eat and go, not a place to stay for longer time Islamic Mosques portraits every where on the walls kind of doesn't fit a restaurant, maybe an Islamic Funeral home! Below average service, although it looks straightforward, you order your meal and pay (no credit cards accepted) but I had to ask for one of the girls to wipe our table, when she came to do the job, no single word, no \"have you been here before?\" no smile and wearing Hijab..ideal for service in Saudi Arabia or something...The objective analysis is 4 starts due to the bad service. PEOPLE IN THE FOOD BUSINESS, SMILE AND INITIATE A SMALL CONVERSATION, THAT'S HOW IT WORKS IN CANADA"}
{"text":"Hmmmmmm I love this place! The food is the absolute bomb oh my god. The fresh bread that comes with it too! So good! A definite must try for anyone in the area! The mango slush is also a definite must try!   I usually order from the dinner menu because it has the meat, veggies and rice! Also the bread! I think one of the best ones is the barg or at least I always order that! The price is very good for the portion food you get."}
{"text":"Loved their food when we went to visit our friends. Place was very crowded and some people were holding on to our chairs so that they could sit when we got up. Their snarky comments made it impossible to finish our dinner . Wish the place was bigger"}
{"text":"This middle eastern restaurant definitely gives you YOUR money's worth. I eat a lot, but when you're having fun talking with a group of people you'll find you've eaten only 3/4 and you're already full.  Plenty of seats, the decor is nice but not noteworthy, and service is okay and nothing special.  I recommend eating here if you just wanna try something different. Prices are all standard fare."}
{"text":"My pal and I decided to go to Bamiyan Kabob for lunch after going for pedi's. For a Saturday afternoon (3:oo pm), it was packed! There was no place to sit so we opted for take out to bring back to my place.   We ordered the regular chicken (a-ok, nothing to write home about), tikka (tender, flavourful beef) & tandoori kebabs (delicious!) with rice, salad, and 2 naan breads. For all this food, the bill was under $30.   Make sure to ask for the yogurt sauce as they don't give you any unless asked.   Good for: cheap eats"}
{"text":"Excellent food at very good prices.    I often stop by to have a couple of Kababs.  The lamb is to die for."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this location.  I've been to several of the other locations.  The food is very good.  The meals are pretty straight forward.  Meat cooked over the fire.  Salad with their special dressing and a tomato onion salads with spices.  Naan and rice are also available, but I can't eat the Naans because I have to eat a gluten free diet.  The salad is a pretty basic salad, but it's good, and it's really the meat that brings me back over and over again.  I've tried the chicken, beef, and lamb, and the minced meats, and like them all, but today I had the lamb.  The lamb is cooked and spiced perfectly.  It's always cut thin and has lots of juice and flavour.  I've had it several times.  The staff are good, the place is clean, it's not too noisy and the patrons are always very polite as well.  They serve afghani food which is quite nice.  I can't eat the Naans, but they are very different from an Indian or Pakistani Naan.  My friends describe them as more crispy.  Each location makes their Naans a little differently.  I very much liked this location and will return for more of the very tasty meats."}
{"text":"Wow I am super impressed! I'm staying at an airport hotel and looked up restaurants on Yelp and decided to try something new. This Afgani food is incredible!  Chicken was juicy and full of flavor, rice and veggies perfectly complimented the Chicken. I highly recommend the Tandoori Chicken Kabob!  People are super nice and welcoming as well!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Clean kitchen. Food is just amazing. The kebobs are so juicy. The only thing is that the platters are not shareable."}
{"text":"The kebabs are excellent- I love this place, the food is amazing and the prices are very resonable"}
{"text":"Smells great as soon as you walk in the door.  Food is amazing, healthy and generous portions."}
{"text":"It's ok, maybe I am ordering the wrong stuff. Had the half chicken and the sultani dinners. Chicken is pretty juicy but not that flavorful.  The sultani is ok. The both the beef and kofta are fine, just nothing special.  The rice and the salad that come with the dinners are meh. The bread is good. Both times I went they gave me the wrong food (takeout) so make sure you inspect your orders."}
{"text":"Pretty huge place with lots of seating, it's kind of like a fast food style place where you go up to the counter to order....the employees were pleasant to explain to me what I should get, got the sultan which u get a filet mignon and beef skewer, comes with a generous amount of rice and salad, didn't really like the naan as much, too bready Also got the chicken breast which was good, rmb to ask them to get the white dipping sauce, that was good"}
{"text":"Hubby has been craving Afghan food for awhile, so we were pretty excited to see that this was so close to our hotel when we pulled up Yelp to check out local eateries.  If you're unfamiliar with their menu, my best recommendation to you is to check it out online for the full description.  When you're at the restaurant, the menu doesn't give you a description so you're left to decipher menu items like Chaplee, Barg, and Kofta.  Glad we did our research beforehand.  We didn't realize this was a chain restaurant, so we were rather impressed.    Hubby got the lamb dinner and I got the filet mignon dinner.  The orders were huge!  You certainly won't leave hungry and it's likely you'll have lots leftover.  We both enjoyed our meats, they were cooked oh-so-tastily.  The accompanying salads are refreshing, but the rice portion is insanely large (and oh-so-fluffy).  I wasn't a fan of their naan though.  It was dry and tough.    Try their mango smoothie, it won't disappoint.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Best kebab place I've been to.  Great food and friendly service.  What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Lunch is good here. Nothing I am wowed over.  The best part is the meat.  I had a few meat options and they were all excellent.  They rest is almost basic filler with little effort or taste."}
{"text":"As if it wasn't difficult to just find ANY place to eat near York University, one can only wonder the struggles to find a good place to eat. With my stomach rumbling, I happened to walk upon Bamiyan in a strip mall.   The owner boasts the place as the \"Best Afghan Halal Cuisine in the City.\" Surely its not that difficult to make that claim when you're probably the only one of its kind in Toronto, but that doesn't stop Bamiyan from living up to its full potential!   The fast food like tables may give it a Burger King feel, but the herbs and spices will instantly transport you to the Middle East!  You really don't need to be a food expert to understand the cuisine...meat, flame, spices, and bread! Bamiyan truly does it right! All the exotic flavors make such wondrous dishes!  Everything from the juicy barg kabob to the sweet, tasty Choppan kabob are simple, but an absolute treasure. We ordered family style so got to try almost everything on the menu, and its all sooo good! The wraps definitely get two thumbs up! And the naan, just what you expect...hot, crispy bread that goes nicely with the kabob. Caution: the spices do add a bit of unexpected spicyness to the dish but just adds to the depths of flavor!  Bamiyan definitely exceeded all expectations and a diamond in the rough!  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"I loved the chicken platter here. I am basically from usa but had come to Canada for a vacation. My friend took me to this place where she ordered chicken platter for me. It was an authentic Afghani place. The chicken was soft and yummy. The grains of the rice was long and had a subtle flavor to it. Along with it, they give afghani naan, salad and 2 sauces. The whole platter was so filling. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"NIce.. Food is great... price is worth it.... I would recommend anybody to try it...  Only thing.. it is always busy and at least 40 min waiting..."}
{"text":"My favourite kabob place! The meat is so juicy and tender! Cheap food as well if you order the dinner plate, the portion is so big that I have to take some of it home.  I recommend Chaplee dinner plate, my all time favourite"}
{"text":"Great food it takes longer then usual because it's cooked fresh.  I've eaten here over two years not once was I dissatisfied with the food  Highly recommend Quy"}
{"text":"This location serves the same great food as the other location I been going to on Overlea since 2002! Keep up the excellent work and service!"}
{"text":"My husband and myself invited our friends for dinner at Bamiyan . I told her we are going to a Afghani place. The name was new to them as they are from Croatia, but when they tasted their food, they really liked it. the Kofta kebab, tandori dinners are very tasty. The roti (nan) are so fresh and so tasty. Wen go there often. I like the rice too and the chutney (spicy sauce) they give with the food is also very tasty. The serving is big . The food is always fresh.   There is one on Dixie but thats too crowded , we like to go on Drew road, no wait time."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. I often go here for delicious wraps. The barg and tikka wraps are my go-to's and have biggg chunks of beef. There's really not much else to say. There has been the odd time I've been there and the wrap didn't have enough vegetables and was consequently limp, but I am generally satisfied with their reliability.    FYI prices recently went up. There's also been a guy working in the kitchen that seriously looks like Rambo from First Blood - so jacked! Entertainment value +1."}
{"text":"Wow... Wow... Wow... Speedy service, great food. Very clean and friendly service. I love everything thats on the menu. So don't be shy, try each and everyone with confidence. But.... my favorite is the \"Firnee - Creamy pudding, spiced w/ crushed cardamon seeds and pistachios\""}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Afghani kabobs as we've been coming here since they've opened a few years back.  I believe this was there 2nd location after the original one in Don Mills and now there's about 6 locations so they done well.  It's a sit down/take out place as you order and pay first up front and then wait for your number to be called.  Basically the menu is pretty straight forward as then menu is divided into dinners (kabobs, rice, salad and naan), meals (kabobs, salad and naan) and wraps.  The kabobs are delicious, tender and flavourful.   Can't go wrong with any of them to be honest but our favourite tends to be the traditional Kofta and the Beef Tenderloin.  Not a big fan of their version of naan as its pretty hard and dry...traditional Indian naan is way better.  However the spicy sauce is outstanding so ask for extra!  Wait time can vary but they do get slammed during dinner and lunch rushes so be prepared to wait if you are in a rush or haven't called in your order."}
{"text":"This place is really good - one of few dining choices in the area.   Every time I've been here everything has been delicious. I find everyone who works here to be really friendly, too - which is always a plus.   The meat is good, but the sides are great too. I've been meaning to go back and try something new but I am pretty predictable, I always go for chicken.   Fun fact - I once worked at a place where we got take-out from here as our work holiday party. Yeah, I guess the budget was tight that year - but this is how I first tried Bamiyan so at least I got that out of it?"}
{"text":"Its been over a year since i've tried this place.  The food was good, and the portions are nice! I didn't know what to expect, but its sort of cafeteria seating, and you go up to the counter and order.  Lots of seating, Parking is good.  Not sure during busy time,   I have a craving now.. gonna go try it again soon."}
{"text":"Literally the best Afghan food I've had in my life! And I eat out A LOT! It's so nicely done, the meat is cooked as you want, and the rice is just next level. I usually buy the dinners, simply because its a good deal for the price and it fills you up! Unfortunately, they have actually decreased the portion sizes? So now it feels a little pricey for what you get? But it tastes the same! I definitely come here every couple of weeks! Too delish! The place isn't fancy or anything, very casual and sometimes very busy! You do have to wait a bit but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for a while. Just always so busy. I finally decided to come for lunch. I wasn't disappointed. Friendly staff. Good portions at a reasonable price.  I ordered the Tandoori Chicken Kabob Dinner. Simple ingredients and melt in your mouth chicken.   Left stuffed and happy!  Definitely will be coming back to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Best Afghan kebabs I've had anywhere. Full disclosure, never been to Afghanistan. So \"anywhere\" really only means between Kitchener-Waterloo and Toronto, take what you will from my review given the limited range of experience.  Still, you get a huge plate of food, warm Afghan naan right out of the oven and quick friendly service for a reasonable price. What's not to love? OK the place can't keep up with the traffic especially on weekends so you're more than likely to sit down at a table that's still got food bits left on it. Hey, this ain't Michelin 4 star, so get over it, pull out a few napkins and wipe the table yourself. You don't pay any tips so no big deal as long as you set your own expectations appropriately.  I've had the tandoori (always tender), the regular chicken, the beef kebabs and the giant \"pucks\" of ground meat (not sure what it is but it's super tasty and you get two of them). They are all good, as is the rice. Even the salad is nice, although it's nothing special at least it's always fresh due to the high turnover. Spice level is low/moderate -- enough for good flavor but spice diehards will be disappointed, even with the red sauce they give you.  Only food complaint is the naan is great when you get it but quickly cools and hardens. By the end of the meal it's terrible, so if you like bread, eat it first while it's warm. (And they give you such a huge slab that if you do eat it all, you'll lessening your chances of actually finishing your meal. I have a decent, but not huge appetite, and I cannot finish the meals with two skewers ever. Still I order those because they are the best value.)  For some reason, there's always a screaming baby whenever I go there. Take out is usually the better option, as it's so crowded and noisy."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place when a friend took me to the mississauga location a couple years ago.  The food is very good, well priced and different enough than the norm when you want to change things up.  So happy they finally opened a location in Richmond Hill.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because they don't accept credit card.  Debit or cash only.  Other than that, it's a full 5!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, so fresh, generous portions, fast service, love it. I go there once a week"}
{"text":"I have eaten at several of these chains, every time thinking that perhaps this chance will be a bit better and honestly, this food is so underwhelming, I just give up at this point. The meat is bland and often dry and overcooked, served with rice and a salad (generic lettuce with ranch dressing-type stuff) and their naan tastes like cardboard. The rest of the stuff is edible, but the naan is just plain atrocious. I have had Afghani food in other locations and it's flavourful and delicious. This does not hold up. I guess it's take out quality, so a sort of McDonald's version of Afghan food, but I'd take a Big Mac any day over this stuff. Bleh."}
{"text":"I come here very often because the food is always good with large portions and decent prices. The tandoori chicken is really good and I highly recommend it. The hot sauce is also delicious. Always ask for extra! They use brown basmati rice and it tastes so good. If you're picking up food, it's always best to call ahead as it may take some time. They don't take credit card so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Bamiyan has always been welcome addition to the neighborhood, providing an assortment of favorites that aren't spicy but oh so exotic . Over the last ten years there was an influx in Afghan refugee claimants within the area, and this has been reflected in the stores and restaurants that have popped up since.  The place is designed well and has been optimized for maximum seating, and despite this it's packed non-stop during lunch time and after work. The food is just great, the meat is always tender and juicy with that right amount of spice.They do two different types of naan so be sure you order what you want as my friend got a thinner near pita like naan with his meal and we had it changed  to the thick one without any issue.  If you're planning just to get take out, call your order in and pick it up, but if you want seating you may not always have enough room for your party as the place is usually packed.  I drop in at least once a week just to grab some healthier take out options without forgoing meat and I don't think I'll stop anytime soon.  Recommendation: -Beef Kofta Kabab Roll"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.    It was crazy busy when we went though, and the wait was long, and tables weren't cleared or cleaned after guests left.  Though the food was cooked fresh- we waited almost 45 minutes for our food, and we were so glad that the portion sizes were huge!  I know they have other locations, so I'll likely go to those rather than this one again."}
{"text":"This time around we visited their East York location.  Much smaller than their Mississauga location but no shortage of customers!  I've only given this place 2 stars because the wait time is, in my opinion, unreasonable.  The food is good, but we recently visited another Kabob place (review pending) where the food was equally excellent, price equally affordable, but the wait time was reasonable.   For a place that has fast-food style service where you place your order, pick up your order at the counter on a plastic cafeteria tray, I can't understand why I should wait 30 minutes for my order.  There is a quality to fresh food, but I don't think that's the problem, I feel that it's just a mis-management of time and resources. There was one guy whose job it is to make and stack styrofoam takeout boxes... and then put the food from the grill into the window- the whole kitchen is about the size of a train-car diner.  I think there are more efficient ways of handling food.   Speaking of food handling, food passes through 5 people before it enters your hands: 1. the grill master 2. the sous- grill master who takes food off kabobs 3. then to mis-en-place for plating 4. the styrofoam box maker to put it in the window 5. the cashier/sous-cashier who puts plates on the trays.  That's a lot of hands...  We tried to call in our order, but no one picked up- when I asked the cashier \"what number do I call to place my order\" she replied \"we don't pick up the phone, it's too busy\" then she continued to stand around waiting for a new customer to walk through the door so she could take their order.   We gave it 2 chances, we're not going back."}
{"text":"Pretty clean place, it's more like a takeout place. The white sauce is average. The serving size is big. The kababs are ok. The afghani roti is on point though. I will totally go back for that roti"}
{"text":"The food here is fresh, tantalizes the taste buds, and simply divine. My kids couldnt stop eating the bread, nor the kababs. The only issue I had was the prices. But the food quality simply makes you forget the Canadian dollar!"}
{"text":"There are a few locations of this chain around GTA, this one is probably the busiest and the most consistent quality wise.  Ingredients are fresh, everything is cooked well and portions are quite big, I usually skip rice unless I'm super hungry.  Cash and debit only, no credit cards accepted!"}
{"text":"Every time I hit this location or any other, same fantastic quality. Idk how this place hasn't exploded yet. Get the Tandoori Chicken Dinner and have YOUR LIFE CHANGED!"}
{"text":"Don't know what so special about this place. Looks like regular food court, my lamb chops was dry. Over all it's clean food court ok for lunch"}
{"text":"The diversity found in Toronto is unparalleled to anything I've witnessed in Houston, Nashville, Louisville, Cincinnati, Detroit etc. So when my sister n her hubby pumped me up to go to an Afghan restaurant I was skeptical, knowing from past experiences that ethnic restaurants tend to miss the mark in international markets in terms of flavor and authenticity of cooking techniques.  Oh how I was pleasantly surprised! From the parking lot I could see that Bamiyan Kabob being located in an East-Indian-prominent shopping complex that it might live up to the hype. Walking in on a Saturday night It was packed to the brim with Brown folk and thier offspring running wild knocking shit down and bumping into you unapologetically. What a scene. I felt like I was back in Pakistan.  The menu board seemed fairly unimpressive, all traditional Persian food with no descriptions of the dishes. I trusted my sisters decisions.  We got served Soltani platters which have a mound of rice, standard lettuce salad with a yogurt-based ramoulade drizzled over, and a skewer of Barg Kabob (chunks of steak cooked well-done unfortunately) and a Kufta kabob, very similar to a kubideh. Now the barg kabob stole the show, gorgeous pieces of steak seasoned well, cooked nicely and the meat itself was flavorful and cut through like butter. The Kufta kabob again was textural heaven, the meat wasent ground to a paste like most middle eastern restaurants do so u actually bite into something, not just mush. Plenty of seasoning and herbs were incorporated into the meat and it shined through in every bite. I also tried the tandoori chicken kabobs, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in a red tandoori marinade and grilled to perfection. Now when I sliced through these pieces, it was like cutting into butter. Whatever cut of breast they use is good quality stuff. Now the kicker was the flat kabob, lots of red chili flakes and plenty of seasoning and man my mouth was on fire AND I was sweating up a storm lol. Very overpowering spice but seeing how much the crowd was enjoying this specific item made it evident they like the spiciness and could care less about the flavor of the actual meat.  The bread however was unimpressive, very commercial tasting. But I was here for the meat so I could care less about the rice and bread.  U don't go here for service. It's mainly self-service, and if u need a table wiped down u best wait a while or bring your own Clorox wipes. Place is fairly clean, plenty of seating but they don't make the best use of the space. Certain areas of the restaurant are packed with tables and then u see big gaps in other areas which is annoying to see when your party of 5 is standing with no seats but plenty of empty floor space."}
{"text":"This place offers some pretty good Afghan Food. Portion sizes are Large and price is very fair. I just wish they more a bit more on their menu, such a lamb options, but there's always room for improvement. If recommend this place for family and friends."}
{"text":"The Rice has no flavor in it.and the chicken is salty.I couldn't eat my platter due to such taste please dont burn your pockets by going here.The quality is lost here"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something new so went along to this place and glad I did. The food was very good, not greasy and perfect. Had the steak kebab, let's just say my tummy thank me. A lot of people said the chilli was spicy but I took it and it was okay like a regular salsa . Practically finished my sauce . Would definitely be coming back. Boyfriend (now hubby;) said the his tandoori chicken was just as good as well .  I fully recommend."}
{"text":"I'd give this a four star, definitely will be coming back for seconds and third. The chilli isn't all that spicy . More like salsa. Very good."}
{"text":"Great spot for some authentic Afghan cuisine. They have a great selection of dishes which are all made fresh and with premium ingredients. I had the beef tikka with salad, there was an option with rice but I decided to go lite. A friend of mine had the kabob with rice and salad. The meat was fresh, deliciously seasoned, but the portion was a bit smaller when not getting the rice as an option (for the tikka), however the kabob rice and salad combo was the best for the quantity. I highly recommend the meal with rice if you're hungry! I felt they could have put a bit more salad in the meal, it could have been more filling. They give fresh nan styled bread and a side of cilantro based salsa which is a great dip! I recommend this place and would come back."}
{"text":"I usually call in and order and pick up the food. It's pricey, but it is definitely worth it. You're paying for what you get. Coming from a student who isn't rich. They did raise prices so I come less often. So I have it once in a while. Everything bursts with flavour. I usually get the tandoori chicken dinner or the lamb dinner (I think it's called chopan). It comes with rice, meat, salad, veggies, sauce, naan. Extra sauce is the way to go. Best to eat the naan fresh. The meat quantity goes hand in hand with the rice -- just enough. I always get a kofta on the side to eat with the naan. Very flavourful and always done right. The service and workers are friendly and work quick. I think it's better to do takeout of the dinners rather than dining in."}
{"text":"The name Bamiyan Kabob has been around Toronto ( specifically) Thorncliffe area for quite sometime. Since its inception this place has branched out all over the GTA, and for good reason. The food here is simply amazing.  I have been to this location about 3 times, and everytime I visit, it leaves me wanting more. The food here is always fresh, and whatever meat you get it always very tender. On our most recent visit, we had a big order. Sultani Kebob, Chaplee Kebob, Choppan Kebob..wow. That is all I can say.  Big portions also.The serve you kebobs with some really flavourful rice, and salad. Make sure to get the hot sauce also, its really good but not really that spicy.  Like other have mentioned this place gets packed, and can get quite noisy. So don't bring a date here expecting a romantic setting. :) This place is for families and people who truly enjoy food and eating. Be prepared to wait for your food, but its well worth it.  I will be going again."}
{"text":"The food here is always fresh and delicious. There is nothing on the menu that I don't love. It's healthy, yummy food at a decent price."}
{"text":"Bamiyan is a restaurant/take-out franchise which specializes in Afghani style kabob dishes. Their food is very fresh, reasonably priced, and best of all very very tasty. Having mainly ordered take-out I have found their service to be very good and all orders have been packaged correctly. During my few experiences dining in, the food was well presented and the portions were plentiful. The dining area/kitchen also appear to be very clean which is a huge positive in my mind. My office loves Bamiyan and everyone who has ordered it has been impressed by the value, taste, and quality of the food. I recommend the Kofta, Chicken Tikka, and if you like spicier stuff their Chaplee Kabob. They offer two types of plated combos, one which includes just salad and a large Afghani-style naan bread and a \"dinner\" which includes rice, salad, and the naan bread. A variety of wraps are also available (my suggestion for someone looking for a smaller meal but who still wants the authentic Bamiyan taste."}
{"text":"First time trying Afghan food, and I'm glad I went here!   Arrived around 5:45 and it wasn't too busy. I highly recommend coming a little bit earlier as it gets super busy after 6pm! There were tons of people ordering take out.  PROS:  - The kofta kabobs were fantastic!!! So flavourful, tender, and went really well with the cream sauce they give you  - The naan bread was amazing. Never had it before, and I've been missing out! The bread came out super hot and fresh, it had the right amount of crisp and chewiness to it! It comes with the meal too! Score! :)  - The portions are huge and its such a great deal! $10.49 plus tax. I was able to save lunch for tomorrow!   - The workers there are very nice! My boyfriend went over to the cash to see if he could swap the hot sauce they gave him with the cream sauce. They were nice enough to offer him not 1 but 2 more cream sauces, and let him keep the hot sauce - The place is kind of like a food court, where you order and sit down wherever you want! I like that type of environment because I don't feel rushed    CONS:  - It took quite a long time after we placed our order to get our food. We waited about 20 minutes. Even after waiting so long, the food wasn't as hot as we expected (except the naan bread, which was extremely fresh!)   Other than that, it was great! If you're not in a rush, then this place is worth waiting for.   Can't wait to go back and try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Has the best half chicken. But I go to this place often and always opt the rice option for another naan. They are amazing and the chapli kabob are amazing."}
{"text":"If you like Kabab's, rice, naan or meat, you will love this place. Rather spicy but that can be a very good thing if you like a bit of spice in your life."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating Afghani food and it was quite a pleasant experience. I arrived around 12:30 on a Saturday, it wasn't that busy and I just beat the lunch rush soon after. The restaurant was very spacious and the staff were kind and helpful.   I ordered a Sultani Kabob Dinner, which is a combination of Barg Kabob and Kofta Kabob including rice, salad, and naan. Also, I bought a $3 Mango Smoothie. My overall total was approximately $18. Both the kabobs I got in my dinner were very savoury and the rice and salad were very satisfying too. My kabob dinner came with a small mix of diced tomatoes and cilantro which I didn't like, next time I will ask not to include that beforehand. The complimentary sauce for my kabob dinner was good too and did enhance the taste of my meal.The mango smoothie was very delicious and I would have ordered another one again but the price deterred me from doing so. My meal was very filling. Additionally, I was able to get extra dressing for my salad, which is probably caesar dressing, on the side after I ordered.  I feel the mango smoothie could have been a bit cheaper, but overall it was worth it. If I ever crave for Afghani food again, I would go to Bamiyan Kabob."}
{"text":"So I decided to go to this place with a group of friends as they heard great reviews about this restaurant at their other locations and to have one soo close to the University was just an added bonus. However, I was greatly disappointed with the decor, cleanliness and the food at this place.   The decor was rather plain and did not live up to the expectations of the Hype created before the opening. The place was definately not clean, with food all over the floor and uncleaned tables ( agree its a take out atmosphere but with tables to seat customers, I would expect some cleaning after the customers leave)  Now to the most important part of going to any restaurant: The Food The food was average priced, not too expensive. The portion size were huge. The food was rather bland, the taste was rather bland and the flavors weren't infused into the meat very well. I had the Chicken kebab dinner. The chicken was dry and the rice wasnt flavorful. My friend had a chicken tikka dinner and that tasted much better than my choice but I have had much better.   It will definitely suffice some hungry university students but doesnt meet up to its expectations.. Will not go there again unless I have no other choice..."}
{"text":"So if you gotta wait for 15 minutes to place your order in a queue, its a good sign, right?  Yes, yes, yes! Absolutely amazing kebabs.  The Tandoori Chicken Kebabs have been hands down the best I've had in Toronto so far. Club it together with delicious Kabilee Rice and you'll sweep the plate clean. Tender, moist and outrageously foodgasmic!  We also order Half Chicken which happens to be fantastic too!  There's only one option for dessert, The Firni. Usually I expect a lot of nuts but it had none. Still, you can make out how fresh it was.  They were absolutely busy, still the service was amicable. Brilliant place!"}
{"text":"Bamiyan is a bit of a hidden gem, as I didn't know about it until a coworker brought me here. The restaurant does Afghan kebabs with some other common Middle Eastern and South Asian foods, and is a combination of a takeout and sit-in place, in the sense that you order the food from a counter while there's also ample seating provided. The decor is nice and as mentioned before, there's plenty of seating. The food itself is fairly priced with ample amounts of rice and meat. The meat itself was a bit dry compared to what I'm used to, but still very flavourful. Definitely a great spot for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Ever since trying their dishes at the Don Mills locations I've been hooked! This location is much bigger, so no more waiting for free tables. Great option for bigger families."}
{"text":"Consistently great food, one of the best Afghan restaurants in the city. However the ambience seems more like a fast food place so it's not a place for a fancy dinner. The value is amazing and portions are large. It is quite busy, I normally take out."}
{"text":"Been here many times good place to eat need to come before lunch or dinner because if you come in on those high time expect to wait for a long time. So bring some snacks with you & good luck. Having lunch /dinner with Muzaaa the Champ"}
{"text":"First time here enjoy myself with so call friends very busy after 5 come after make sure u eat something big line up would come back here again only if I get a ride with Muzaaa or my so call friend Charles ingalls if eat at home."}
{"text":"This place is great!  The food is clean, healthy and hot!  The vegetables are also fresha and the naans are to die for!  I would definately recommend this place!  The selection is limited but they food is so good, I usually go once a month!  The food quality is really superior and the same every time I go.  Finally, the price is fair!"}
{"text":"This location is oky the food is the same great test but they service is horrible the team which was work on this date were confused none were afghan  not that I'm saying they should of been or   if they were they would be better. Just they all need more training in customer service  may be next time they will work on it"}
{"text":"Deliciously tasty; well prepped. Quick and easy and great for a quick bite whether alone or with a group of friends."}
{"text":"This place is a breath of fresh air next to the mediocre international cuisine available on campus. The key to Bamiyan is their impeccable consistency of flavour, the delicious and fresh from the oven naan bread (as a previous reviewer stated, it looks kind of like pizza dough and on first glance looks \"processed\", but the flavour is there).  I've tried most of the various kabob on offer at this point, and the only time I was disappointed was with their 1/2 chicken. Go for any of the beef dishes and you won't be disappointed.   Prices are also reasonable, and the staff are friendly and helpful. The place is clean but has a mall food court / cafeteria feel to it...but the prices match the decor, cheap!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome and it's close to my work. I always go there when I want to eat a good lunch it's little expensive but it's really wort it!  I could say Bamiyan kabob is my best restaurant! And I highly recommend this place to everybody!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is enormous sized and tastes heavenly. The customer service is really shitty. I am a regular customer at this location and the last time I was here, my fiancée and I waited 45 minutes for our number to be called. The girls working behind the counter just stood there and our food was already prepared and packed 15 from ordering. When we went to ask for the food, their response was \"oh it was here\". There was no apologies given. Hopefully the start improving the customer service soon. But other than that, this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"I love trying new and different types of food, I was up here in Toronto on Vacation couple of months ago, And heard about this place, it was my first time eating Afghan Food, but one word could describe this Delicious. The place was packed for a reason on a Thursday night. If I'm ever in Toronto, this is one place to go."}
{"text":"Came at 12:45. Service slow as molasses. If you are in any kind of rush this is not the place."}
{"text":"4 stars for food and service  EXCELLENT TASTY FRESH FOOD ambience is just okay  overall love it :)"}
{"text":"Had the Sultani  . Still the best places for Afghani  food  PERIOD !!!  The taste of the meat to the rice is very difficult to duplicate and beat. There are other places we have tired and nothing really compares to Bamiyan Kabob.   Its a treat every time you go. Especially when you are carving for IT !!!  A BIG FAN of this place. Keep up the great work.  We have tired the Markham location and is still the same as the original location.   Thanks for the food."}
{"text":"Every since I heard they opened a new location on Markham Road, I was instantly in love. No longer do I have to drive all the way to the Don Mills location to have cheap, quick afghan food.  Bamiyan lay out in all locations is like a food-court. You order from the cashier and you pick up your food and clean up after yourself. BUT may i assure you, quality is NOT sacrificed.  My favorite is the chicken kabob dinner. I'm usually not a fan of chicken breast, I find most places makes chicken overly dry.  I order the chicken kofta almost every time, since you get chuncky juicy pieces of chicken breast AND grounded meat for $11.50, including naan bread, rice and salad. The rice they serve here is the brown basmati rice, it's light enough you won't need to be rolled out after finishing a huge meal. Another one I tried is the lamb (not sure what it's called) but i find the meat portion is a little to small, chicken kofta is more bang for your buck!   I would advice you to dine in rather than take out. If you do ask for take out ask them to put the salad in a separate box since the condensation of the hot rice will affect the crispiness of the salad. OH ! and ask a side of white sauce, it's some sort of yoghurt/ranch and it goes really well with the meat.!"}
{"text":"I remember the last time I stepped inside this building...it used to be Ferrovia Italian Restaurant... That's explain why all these flagged stone and Italian tiles on the floors and the walls.  Of course now Bamiyan Kabob took out all the chic furnishing, shutters, chandeliers it looks like more of a fast food joint.  Nothing wrong with a fast food as long as it tastes good and reasonable priced. And Bamiyan Kabob is just that... Order your food...Wait for your number.....Pick up your food...Enjoy.  Tikka Wrap ($5.29) - The Beef Tenderloin is cooked Medium Well with just a hint of pink is surprisingly moist and tender - Extra Spicy can be a little bit for spicy but the sauce is quite tasty - love the idea of a wrap as I can eat my lettuce, tomato and red onion at the same time as a quick lunch  One thing I have to give Bamiyan Kabob credit is though it is a \"fast food\" joint concept, at least you get real plate and cutlery... I just hate using plastic knife and eat on Styrofoam plate.  I do smell like smoke and meat after eating here... If you do eat in, stay far far away from the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Excellent Kababs,horrible service! The place is always packed.  If you want to just enjoy good food and do not want a restaurant experience than this is the perfect place for you.  Good for take out. The service is horrible because of the number of customers they get. They have a don't care attitude which irks me anytime I go in."}
{"text":"I like Bamiyan Kabob and this location is good.  They offer the bare necessities to run a kabab joint.  Also, the service is good.   However, I wish they offered more to their menu.  I prefer the Markham location because it has more drinks and desserts - most likely because it's busier.  But it wouldn't hurt to have their frozen ice cream which is absolutely yummers. Needless to say, the kabobs here are great.  The meat is tender and juicy.  Also, any place that offers a bed of rice and salad is a winner in my book.  A bonus - the portion sizes are huge!  And on top of that you get toasty warm, Afghan bread (a must-try!)."}
{"text":"No matter which location you eat at the food is consistently delicious. Cooked to order! Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Always delicious and juicy meat skewers and then wash it down with a cup of mango smooth."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and ordered a veggie Kevin wrap and this potato pancake thing which I forgot the name and couldn't pronoun properly.  Anywho, the wrap was really tasty and the fact it was only veggie you know they love to make people happy with their food.  My favourite though was potato pancake thing.  It's like a thin pancake stuffed with potato and herbs and it was so yummy!!!   A must go to sure.  The staff is nice too!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and that place is busy but never crowded like other locations. Nan has a shape of a sandal and is huge and very tasty.  I've tried most kebobs and my favorite is Sultani Kabob - a combination of chunks of filet Mignon and lean ground beef. Rice is perfect, too. It's always freshly prepared.  Decor is very nice - perhaps similar to other locations. It features a famous (and my favorite) picture of an Afghan girl taken by Steve McCurry (google Sharbat Gula). This location is fairly new in The Great Punjab Business Centre. One can go Indian grocery or fabric shopping while in that area. The Centre is large but not very frequented by locals - Bamiyan Kabob seems to be the busiest of all in the area."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick and delicious bite. Its self-serve; you order at the counter and they call your number when its ready.  All their meats are well seasoned; very flavourful; exact same menu as the other locations. My favorites are: kofta (cheap and delish), half chicken, and sultani (both barg and kofta). The dinner platers come with salad, meat, generous portion of rice, and fresh naan. Carbs and meat overloaded! Be prepared to drink tons of water after your meals as you will be thirsty.  Free water available at the counter, just ask. Fast and efficient service. It gets way too crowded during dinner rush and parking may be difficult in this plaza"}
{"text":"Quick dinner option, well marinaded meat. The dinner comes with rice, salad, homemade naan, and meat of your choice. We like the half chicken dinner, tandoori chicken, and mixture of beef (steak, and kabob)"}
{"text":"My go to place if I want a very filling meal. I always order the tandoori chicken. The portions are more than enough. I love their rice and salad."}
{"text":"I should update my review as it seems every time I go here, it's always on point. Everyone raves about the tandoori chicken, but I personally love the Kofta. It's lights out the best Kofta I've had."}
{"text":"27$ for two dishes so a total of 2 small skewers and rice Naan tiny salad portion with Presidents choice ranch sauce and water. Jip. I can make life this under 5$. Also they try to sell you water and hide the free water jugs until you ask for it like a beggar."}
{"text":"I was recently in Canada and my family took me here and wow I have probably gone there everyday that I was there. Food is excellent and so yummy, chicken kabob with rice salad and fresh naan ummm so good I wish I was there now and there tandoori chicken, lamb uhhh so so good.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Great service, amazing food, good prices.  Although be careful for weekends this place gets extremely busy  but well worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place. Other than the food are always fresh and taste good, they also have very generous portion but cheaper than other kabob places. The restaurant is clean and bright,  lots of seating inside and it is definitely my favourite restaurant in GTA."}
{"text":"Food was good.. Had the lamb.. Service was not very good at all..  Food sat at on the counter as they called 2 orders that were before me.. Not very impressed"}
{"text":"Bamiyan has redefined the fast food experience. You walk in... and it looks like a fast food restaurant... but after you order, it takes about ten minutes to prepare. The fire back there is hot hot hot, and it smells great! The wait is well worth it. The price is comparable to fast food chains ($5 - $12 for dinner), but the value is much higher.   Most of the dishes are difficult to pronounce, but they only have about eight items to order. If you like spicy, ask them for the spicy stuff. I believe they only have one spicy dish.  The food is fresh, and the portions are great. If you haven't been there, this is a must-try."}
{"text":"Personally i think the food is over priced for how much meat you get, ive had their tikka kebab and tandoori kebab, both times ive only had about 5-6 pieces of meat (it was good) and plate full of bland rice, paid over 12 dollars for each dish. You only get hot sauce with your order, garlic sauce and anything else is extra."}
{"text":"Nice afghan place.  The portions are massive. We had 2 people eat off one portion.   Had the chicken, lamb and beef kabobs.  Was very nice, great flavors and overall very fresh and tasty.  Inexpensive for the quality of the good.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Bamiyan Kabob on Sat night and the place was packed with families and people who wanted to get their share of the delicious kabobs. You order your food at the counter and wait for your number to be called. Had to wait about 10 minutes but it was fairly quick. The place is only so big but seating wasn't a problem as people just ate and left shortly afterwards.   I ordered the chicken kofta kabob dinner (one skewer of chicken, one skewer of kofta which is ground beef). Both were delicious and flavourful. The chicken was extremely juicy and not dry at all. The dinner came with rice, salad, and bread. The rice is out of this world, I could eat it everyday if I wanted to! Amazing. Price wise it may be a bit more expensive but the portions you get are huge.  First time trying Bamiyan Kabob and Afghan food and definitely will not be my last!"}
{"text":"We tried the chicken kabob dinner, TANDORI kabob chicken dinner and sultani kabob ( kofta and filet Mignon).  Meats are juicy and flavorful, rice is nice and on this occasion received very little salad.  Guess they were running out at 8pm even though they close at 11pm.   Cashier at front counter was very friendly and helpful.  Interior is basic, clean and feels like a fast food set up."}
{"text":"Went here on Mother's Day. The place was packed in the afternoon. Ordered barg, tikka, kofta, Chapli and bolangi.   The barg and tikka were a bit dry and chewy. The best thing I had was the Chapli kabob. Had the tandoori chicken before, that was okay too.   If you want kafta kabob, just walk ten meters over to the next restaurant, Paramount, they have the best. Skip on the regular rice they give, ask for the Qabili rice.   They don't accept credit cards which was a bit frustrating. Also add that to the fact my debit wasn't working with the machine. So make sure to bring cash as backup.   They have outside seating but it wasn't open when I went there Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I have decided I like Afghani food after eating here.     Location:  So this place is located in the section at East Beaver Creek and Hwy 7 where all the western restaurants are located ( there are a lot of Asian restaurants in the area, This are is where a lot of chain western restaurants are located)  There's plenty of parking, but because there's a lot of restaurants, you might find you have to park a wee bit away if you are coming on the weekend. ie. Friday or Saturday night.    Décor:  Casual.  it's plain, neat, nice colours.  You have your choice of table or booth.  Tables can seat from 4 to 24.  Nice for big groups.  The big tables aren't round, they are square..  I like the light fixtures, took a picture but not sure if you can tell.  Ordering:  The restaurants in this area are all sit down with wait staff.  This place is different.  So you order at a counter fast food style.   You have a seat and wit for them to yell out your number.   When it's busy you have to listen real close because you can barely hear them.  It would be great id they had some sort of microphone and speaker so we could hear.  Would save the poor women ( only women) who work the counter  Service  The women at the counter are really nice.  i never know what to order and they always suggest the best food.  The food also comes really fast.  It's not the most complicated food, so I'm glad .  We were all hungry, we were glad to get our food quickly!   Food:  So basically from what I can tell you can get kabobs, salads, and wraps.  Nice and simple  I got steak kabobs dinner. It's the one on the front cover of the menu.  Most popular item apparently.  Your food comes on huge oval plates, a brown basmatti riec over flowing, gren salad, a small tomato and onion salsa type sald, and a piece of naan bread.  I got a steak kabob and a kaftka kabob.   Loved my meal.  The steak was soft and tender, nicely flavoured, the naan soft and chewy like you expect.  The rice was cook well, not over or under done. Season well, and I loved the dressing on the salad, not sure whata it was, we referred to it as white.(because it was white. haha)   Conclusion.:  I could have shared my plate  there was so much food.  Ate half of it there and took the rest home, had it for lunch the next day.  A wonderful treat!  Everyone I was with loved their food as well. thumbs up from the 8 of us!!  Will be back and will bring as many people as I can!!  ."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and I would go here any day of the week ! Best low price for the best quality food ! Love it !"}
{"text":"One of my friends took me here; it was a usual not so fancy but clean spot in this mini mall area, and we ordered and the number came up!! More like screamed the number!! I was starving like Marvin and took my first bite! It felt like someone smacked me when I was I child!! This burst of flavors and eyes wide open kinda moment!! I guarded my plate like I had not eaten in days!! I finished all of the food on my plate in a hot minute!! I didn't say anything until all of the food was gone!! I was looking at everyone's else plates lol, it was amazing!! The food was so good... thank you!! Why can't we have more of this in Windsor??"}
{"text":"I figured it was about time I wrote a review for this place considering that I now go here on a regular basis.  This was my first experience with Afghani food but it came highly recommended by my very picky co workers so I figured it had to be good.  The first time I went I called ahead and placed my order as I had been told it can be very busy.  Good call.  Their website is excellent.  All the items are on there and most have a picture so you understand what you are getting.  The prices are listed as well and they are ridiculously cheap.  Here's the good part - when you drive up to the restaurant and get out of your car the smell hits you.  Grilled meat.  Ahhhhh.  Nothing smells better.  Inside it is big and open.  Lots of tables and very clean.  But oh the smell.    As I stood waiting to pick up my order I watched trays go by piled high with rice, salad, lots of meat and their yummy naan.  Make sure you have a really big appetite or are sharing with a friend if you order the full dinners with rice, salad and naan. They're huge!  I usually order sans rice and it's still a lot.  If you're looking for a lite lunch or a snack order one of their wraps or the salad on its own.  I don't know what it is about the salad but it's sooo good.  It does stay with you a while but it's worth it.   I usually order the Kofta Kabob which is this wonderful spiced ground beef pressed around a metal skewer and grilled.  They serve this really good salsa (?) that has a bit of a bite to it on the side in a little container.  That stuff is golden.  Almost better than the salsa I had in Mexico (almost).    I've also had the half chicken and the marinated beef tenderloin (Tikka Kabob) but I keep coming back to the Kofta.  Oh and the Boulagnee (a fried potato stuffed bread) is really good too.  Heck I don't know if there is anything that isn't good there.  On a final note now that the warm weather is here they have some tables set up outside so you can eat your giant meal and enjoy the weather at the same time.  Bliss."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place. The food is decent but the staff and service are awful. They will always mess up your order, you can be sure of that."}
