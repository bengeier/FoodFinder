{"text":"Great casual bar, the bartender is extremely knowledgable and friendly.  They don't have food and I was craving a burger.  He directed me to a take out joint about 300 yards away and told me that I could bring the take out in and have a pint and relax.  Burger turned out to be great and the service at this pub even better.  Anyone who is looking for a true pub feel please stop in and grab one and say hi. The patrons were all super friendly too.  I will defiantly come back if I'm ever in town from Arizona again."}
{"text":"Great little bar with nice atmosphere and a good selection of beers.  The only down side is they do not have food so if you're hungry go somewhere first."}
{"text":"Nice Bar, bartender was awesome, pretty light pour on my Jameson but overall this is a nice spot for a drink!   They could add some food to get people to stay and hang out, pizza, Shepard's pie, something, it's an Irish pub minus the pub food."}
{"text":"A perfect Irish pub for a few drinks. My husband and I dropped in from out of town to have a couple drinks and ended up staying for 3 hours chatting with one of the co-owners. A real stand-up guy for sure. Our glasses were never empty. It's a cozy casual bar with good beer selections on tap and lots of scotches and liquors to please your palate. No food served here, but they will recommend where to get takeout/pizza and you can bring that right in and eat. Will definitely be stopping by again this trip!"}
{"text":"Another Greyhound person, stopping in while waiting for a connection.   This is a great place to stop in: good selection of beers & whiskeys, friendly bartender, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Grand place to get a perfect pint of Guinness and some Thirsty Dog beers.  Gem of a place: perfect happy hour spot."}
{"text":"Parnell's is a decent pub.  Good beer selection and comfortable place.  This was part of a self-directed Pub Crawl in Gateway District.  I veered off course because Parnell's had such great reviews on Yelp.  I might return here if I was really close by but it wasn't amazing.  It was good.  People were friendly, beer was fine, place was clean, etc., but there was no wow factor and it just didn't seem as if anyone was having any fun here.  Probably just an off night.  Maybe there weren't any shows in town that night?  Anyway, don't avoid Parnell's based on my review but lower your expectations and eat before you go there.  I don't think they serve food."}
{"text":"You cannot find better people than the staff and owner at Parnell's. A must stop before or after a show on Public Square. Its also a great spot to drop in with a friend and catch up over a drink."}
{"text":"I love this location and place! Forewarning to those who are claustrophobic- before and after a playhouse show it can be elbow to elbow. I love that it's busy though because it makes for a nice atmosphere. During the summer, they have cute barrels to sit around and sip craft beer or wine. I love the variety of taps; it is average priced $6-7 per beer. Only a dollar off during happy hour but the old-irish pub feeling is nice if you are going to see a show, or waiting for downtown traffic to subside after work."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here for a drink before catching a show at the Hanna theater downtown. Although there was no food, it was a great place to have a couple beers before the show. The bartender was really friendly and didn't mind letting me try some beer samples. I will make this a definite stop when I am in that area of downtown."}
{"text":"An awesome Irish pub. Great bartender that keeps the party rolling. Nice beer selection."}
{"text":"Ducked in here while it was sleeting and we were so happy we did!  Loved the old bar and had a great, large pour as we warmed up. The bartenders were terrific (Tom & Erin? Hope I got that right)-- and met some friendly locals. All in all, it's everything you want in a downtown Irish bar-- so glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"My husband is a single-malt scotch drinker....this place brings a HUGE smile to his face!  The bartenders are very knowledgeable and friendly.  I have never had a bad experience at Parnell's (and I've been going there for quite a looong time)!"}
{"text":"I've loved the parnells on lee for years, and was happy that the same comfortable and casual vibe is also present at this location. Great views of playhouse square, but you feel like you're miles away in this cozy spot. Unexpected upstairs lounge area is really cool too. Great music selection playing while we were there. Service was personal and quick, we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Definitely as good as it gets. Declan knows his Irish pubs and this is the best in CLE.   Great for after work drink, before show drink, just-broke-up-with-my-girlfriend drink.  The staff is great. Erin is one of my favorites, great smile and knows what all of her regulars drink.   Crowd is pretty eclectic too. Everything from theatre goers, Cleveland State students, people from out of town (met a journalist here from Paris in to cover he Amanda Berry / Gina DeJesus story when that broke), to people who live a stone's throw from here.   It's a great neighborhood made even better by this little bar."}
{"text":"Very nice, very clean and well done Irish bar right in the theater district.  Attentive and friendly staff, good beverage selection, great location.  Exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"This place is great--these folks know how to make a good Irish pub.  There's no fake, gimmicky, B.S. here.  In fact, I would say this is the best Irish Pub in Cleveland, but Parnell's main spot in University Heights wins that award as far as I'm concerned.  I would actually give this place a 5-star review, but it gets way too crowded after a show.  Thankfully, the employees are great and do as good as possible with a massive crowd in a tiny space.  They all strive to give the best service possible, regardless of the situation.  And even though it can get hard to navigate after the theaters let out a big crowd, this is still my go-to post-show spot."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection. They only have a few snacks to eat and were out of the majority.   Also out of limes for the bar. There is a grocery store down the block for gods sake."}
{"text":"Staff seemed pretty friendly and place is very sleek looking in a historical theater district. They have an outdoor patio and good bar area with tv's to check out the game. I definitely liked the atmosphere.   They didn't have any munchies which put me off a little but all iin all a good place to check out in Gateway. It does have the feel of an Irish pub, mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Well lit for a pub with enough room to enjoy your after work drinks."}
{"text":"This bar was awesome and walking distance from the hotel we stayed at. The owner and bartenders were very friendly and personable. Not being from Cleveland i wish they had a larger selection of local beers"}
{"text":"Came from Buffalo NY just to get away the bartender was great and super friendly. Fairly priced and great chill atmosphere"}
{"text":"This tiny little bar is located right next to the theater and we almost missed it while trying to locate it. The bartender Joe was extremely nice and friendly and he really tries to make his customers feel at home.   There is no food, but he immediately said he would welcome us bringing in any take out in we wanted.   Overall, it's a great place to stop for a quick drink."}
{"text":"What a welcome edition to Playhouse Square! This Parnell's has all the same good vibes as the one in University Heights and is clean yet cozy. No wasted draft handles, all fine choices, and not only the best Guinness in town (the keg is inches from the tap and pulled by a specialist) maybe the best scotch, whiskey (and whisky) selections this side of the Parnell's in University Heights. . A destination even if not seeing a nearby show. Stay T-irsty Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place as much as other reviewers did but I can't say I get what the hype is all about.  Before a show the other night, my bf and I stopped in for a few beers. It was packed, people were not very nice but a table opened up and we grabbed it. So I thought, \"hey, let's give it a chance.\" Our server was nice as was the bartender but people kept bumping into me and that was super annoying.  They let you bring in outside food, as they do not serve food, from surrounding places. That's pretty cool.  Because of the close proximity to Playhouse Square and the cheap prices, I'd say this place is overall pretty decent. Just try to get there in time to get a table!"}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a quick drink in the Theater district if you have some time to kill or after work for happy hour when they offer $1 off. I don't think they get people hanging out long as there aren't many tables and the only snacks available were dried meat sticks and bags of UtZ chips.   They offer a full bar and the service is quick and friendly. There was seating inside and out and charging stations available. There are a couple of TVs if you're sitting in the right location to view."}
{"text":"I was at Parnell's Friday night with a group of friends, and I had an awesome time! The bartender was so sweet, and knowledgeable. I'll definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little Irish pub that my husband and I stopped in after seeing a play at the Playhouse Square. I don't have anything great to say but I don't have anything terrible either. There is jut a bar, no kitchen so no food is served. There are a few tables as it doesn't seem to get really busy like some other places in the area. The service was good, I think it was just the bartender that took care of everyone which was pretty impressive to do a good job with no help. A nice little place to stop and have a drink and waste some still if you can."}
{"text":"Nice place, good people and overall great time in a wonderful downtown pub keep up the good work"}
{"text":"A clean, cozy place that knows how to pour a Guinness is always welcome in my book, but this location was really thirsting for a pub like Parnell's. They don't serve food, so all their attention goes to pouring nice craft brews and single malts in time for you to get to the theaters nearby. I'm a fan of the original Parnell's, and happy to see this one downtown."}
{"text":"This was such a fun bar to stumble upon and now it is one of our absolute favorites! Although they do not serve food there, they do have chips, popcorn, pretzels, and jerky from the West Side Market available to munch down on. The beer selection is excellent with of course a handful of Irish favorites - including Guinness. The atmosphere was such a blast and the bartenders were an absolute joy to talk to!"}
{"text":"Bam.  I'll mirror the reviews here and say very attentive staff; friendly and serves up a mean cocktail.  Great place to hang post-theatre, was a favorite of our two-week visit.  Definitely a go-to bar in the hood."}
{"text":"It's ok. I don't have a big enough boner for Irish whisky to like this place more. Short grey haired bartender dude was lightning fast though."}
{"text":"Place to stop by for a quick drink before or after the shows in theater district. Staffed by friendly bartender. Usual selection of beers but do have nice assortment of scotch. Outdoors seating is available in summers and is a prime spot for people watching on Euclid Ave."}
{"text":"Nice casual pub to enjoy a good drink before or after a show in theater district. Clean, good service, nice decor, good people watching from patio. It's a go to spot."}
{"text":"Note to parnells: if you are going to charge full menu price for an ipa,  dont take a modetately high abv, columbus bodhi,  and serve it in a sniffer without saying so in menu.  Columbus bodhi in most bars, including at columbus brew pub IN colubus, serves it in a pint glass.  You are taking advantage of unsuspecting customers.   I wont be returning here and will be sure to advise everyone I know of the deceptive beer practices used here.  Shame shame Parnells."}
{"text":"Fabulous and family run public house! Had a great time and terrific conversation with family and the gentleman owner tending bar, Joe (for short). You've gotta get your nice pint here!!!"}
{"text":"Want to make St. Patty's day an everyday option, without the intense partying etc.? Any Irish beer or whiskey you can think of, within reason, is here. Location in the theatre district, this local pub has the Irish flair and casual ambiance that is great for stopping in before or after a play, or even just to stop in because you were in the area like me.  They accommodate both indoor and outdoor seating as well. We only had drinks while we were here, but the staff was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Parnell's is a cute pub tucked away on Euclid Avenue. It's small, but intimate. We had a private event and reserved the snug, which is a small area for maybe 15 people. They have a good variety of drinks, but no food."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my mom and friend before seeing a show at the State Theatre. It was by far the best bar service I have ever had! The bartender as very attentive and knowledgeable. There were lots of choices for beer. I would highly recommend this to anyone and hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink with a friend the other day... What I thought was going to be a non-descript, forgettable, quick pick-me-up actually was a very pleasant way to spend a late afternoon.   The bartender was so friendly and let me try a new draft before committing...   Other patrons were cool and laidback.   Overall, a very nice ambiance. Nice outdoor seating too!  No food, but the bartender offered to show us menus of places nearby that do take-out.   Really cool place!"}
{"text":"Friendly bar..great Irish whiskey with a generous pour.  Right in the heart of downtown.    Loved it!"}
