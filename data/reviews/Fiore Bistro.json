{"text":"Service was good.. Food was amazing.. Great proportion... Had the Portuguese chicken... Destroyed the whole plate"}
{"text":"I literally just had lunch at Fiore Bistro. Well, I was not in an actual bistro, but the meal certainly made me forget I was eating in a food court.  Though, I have been to this place many times before, their food has not ceased to satisfy my hunger and I.  The concept is great. Bistro food served quickly, yet taste and quality remain high. This afternoon, I ordered the grilled chicken with nicely seasoned potatoes and grilled vegetables. All meals include salad or soup and portions are big compared to the average meal size at a food court.  My only problem with this place is the price. My meal cost me almost 23$ taxes included. Perhaps my hunger made me forget to check the prices beforehand, though I was not expecting the meal to cost more than 15$. I find this to be WAY too expensive for a bistro in a food court. Yes, the quality is greatly above food court average, however paying 23$ for my meal made me feel foolish.  But aside from the price, to reiterate, the food is great. They have other options such as pastas, fish, and steak; some equally expensive others more affordable."}
{"text":"Very good for food court food at a good price point. Veal ribs was excellent in flavor but fatty.  I Still recommend this place and would go back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"The grandpa is very friendly and kind.  very generous on the food quantity and amazing taste! Best place you can find in the food court! THE BEST STEAK I EVERY HAD"}
{"text":"Visited from LA, and this place did not disappoint! Huge servings, wide choices, yummy food, warm staff. Yes it's located in a food court, but the food is sit-down restaurant quality. The chef/owner even checked on while we were eating. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went there Saturday before a movie and tried the lamb. The meat was incredibly tender and tasty. I was with my kids so the owner came to sit with us and offered us a glass of red wine. A very good experience and a definete repeat."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch, and ended up being one of the first people. So in an entirely empty restaurant they put me right next to the cash register.  It was so awkward to be sitting there with people constantly standing next to me, or leaning on the cash register (and into my personal space!).  The soup that day was fantastic, however, the veal I had in my main was very dry."}
{"text":"Delicious food and servings are very generous! We arrived half an hour before closing and our food was cooked fresh...they even gave us free samples! The chef was really friendly, he even approached our table to see how we were doing! I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and staff ,welcoming owner,making me feel great. My steak was New York medium rare, the chef handled it well enough. The portion is good too, as a French style bistro,lol. I'll try their fish and seafood next time which also look good too. Awesome concept for a food court bistro"}
{"text":"Delicious! We had the lamb shanks, steak, and  all were delicious and exceeded our expectations.!"}
{"text":"This food counter located within the food court underground La Maison Simons may seem pricey at first, but the meal served is so delicious and totally worth what you pay. They put on display their dishes to help you choose, but I always come back for their grilled veal which is to die for. I am salivating as I type right now so you can guess what I will eat soon! Great place if you eat alone (or even with friends) as you can save on restaurant tips."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgusting and overpriced. Total waste of money. Very watery overcooked pasta. I advise to avoid this place."}
{"text":"I love steak, I really love steak  What's not to love about having a steak in a food court? Your friend wants Burger King while you want real food, no problem. Let your friend have his fast food, which is about $8 for a trio nowadays.  Depending on the cut, it starts at $12 for a 6 ounce NY strip you get to choose from the display fridge and tops out at $20 for a rib steak.  It's made fresh, comes with sides and you eat with actual cutlery. Great when dining solo or don't have time to go to a traditional steakhouse.  This is one the better food courts in Montreal in terms of variety and this places blows everybody out of the water"}
{"text":"Me and my family shared 3 plates. Delicious! The rice was great and the ribs were amazing. The portion are huge. It is like fine dining food in the atmosphere of a food court. Not cheap but worth it....$12 to 24 bucks  Owner was very personable and everyone was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Tricky to find this place. It's in the food court of a mall. Food was good. A bit pricey compared to other options there. $45 for two people... Meat/Rice/Veg combo places and two soft drinks. The owner offered to let us sample dishes, which we did, and of course, when you do there is some obligation to buy! Quite savvy. Like I said... food was good, but expensive for an express lunch for two."}
{"text":"This is a pretty exceptional place within a food court!!! They serve rapidly streak, lamb, pasta and other delicious meals you would find in a sit down restaurant. If you are pressed for time but don't want junk food it is an excellent choice ;)"}
{"text":"We came here on our first trip to Montreal, looked it up on Yelp and thoroughly enjoyed everything! The ribs were done excellently, the lamb was pretty good, and the salmon was very tender and juicy.  Only the rice was a bit hard at times, but overal pretty good.  I think the most memorable was the owner who was quite nice to us, allowing us to sample his food and was very polite in every respect.  Highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"Bom atendimento e boa comida, porém os preços são altos pelo que servem e o tamanho da porção. Paguei 25 dólares por um carneiro. Preço alto para um fast food."}
{"text":"Although, we are not into mall food. We were curious about the nice display of various plates on their counter. One of the gentleman who was working there, I believe he is the owner, invited us over and gave our kids French fries, followed by a plate of samples for all of us. We couldn't help it but to purchase the rib steak plate. Their food is very delicious , excellent customer service and attitude are provided. I can recommend this place to anyone. it's a little pricey but the portions are large and the meats are top grade."}
{"text":"Big portions, well cooked and by that I really mean it since the seasoning, the freshness in the main dish and their absolutely well mannered staff!, we are totally coming back (my only issue is their bread it was old, and the Styrofoam cups for the salad they should put them in mini ramequins)"}
{"text":"For a food court, I really think my meal was overpriced. I paid $29 for the rib with rice and salad. That does Not include a drink. I really think it's overrated. The food wasn't bad. But sitting in the stuffy food court eating this meal wasn't comfortable. I think if I'm eating this at a different setting, the $29 price tag can be justified.  But for $29 I can get a really nice meal at a nice restaurant with sparking water. Wish I went somewhere else"}
{"text":"The owner was super friendly and talkative and kind! Food was also fresh and great, I'd definitely recommend it for sit down or to go. I got the grilled chicken on rice and it was fabulous and came with a side salad."}
{"text":"Who knew that my husband and I would eat the best meal in Montreal at a food court? I perused Yelp for a late dinner spot and saw Fiore Bistro but it was closing soon. The pics and reviews were enticing enough for us to try again for lunch the next day. My husband had no idea we were having lunch at a food court but he was craving rice and meat. I ordered the veal ribs. I was still indecisive but the friendly owner recommended the paella. It was offered once a week. How could I resist? The veal ribs were so tender and fell off the bones. Delicious with right amount of seasoning and grilled goodness. The paella was filled with mussels, clams, jumbo shrimp, squid, and aromatic rice. You definitely can't get that in just any food court. The portions were very generous but we both devoured them like our life depended on it! The owner came to chat with us and was just the sweetest. Aller avec un appétit et partir avec un sourire."}
{"text":"A food court place getting a high review?  Is this possible?  Well yes it is!  As I was starving after doing some shopping and needed a quick bite I stopped by here to see what other Yelpers were talking about.  And I'm glad I did.It hit the spot nicely.  I got the basa fish with the rice and mixed veggies and a side salad. I believe that was $10.  And the portion was HUGE.    The fish was nice and tender which I was surprised because it was later in the afternoon and I would have for sure thought it would be dried out.  Same with the rice but nope it had that freshly cooked kinda taste.  The salad was disappointing - overly dressed and not really interesting, but hey it's just salad.    They have a variety of dishes from chicken to lamb to fish and you will definitely get your fill on here with these portion sizes.  It's probably a bit more expensive than what one thinks of food court food, but you definitely get your money's worth here."}
{"text":"Perfect balance between quality and price, conveniently located in \"Les Cours Mont-Royal\"'s food court Fiore Bistro has excellent, freshly prepared food. Don't let the name fool you: their Hamburger Steak is a delicious, large, juicy ground-beef patty served with mashed potatoes, sauce, choice of soup or salad and bread, all under 10 dollars! It is a large meal even for big boys like me, so you can certainly bring your hunger and still be sure to leave feeling full enough. They have a small variety to choose from, but all well prepared."}
{"text":"Very very interesting place. It's restaurant quality food... In a food court. I got the veal ribs with side salad, after tax was a bit under $29. Price is nothing to praise but lower vs. ordering in a restaurant. The ribs were fantastic, got three bones but meat almost equivalent to a full rack of pork ribs. There were meaty parts, crispy parts, fatty parts, and everything in between. The grilled veg was a bit soggy, likely because I got takeout and moisture in the container didn't help. The rice was perfect! Not dry at all, very moist (in a good way) and flavorful. Very fun takeout meal to eat in my hotel room while visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best food court restaurant that I have been to! Got the lamb, very juicy and flavourful. The grilled veggie was good as well. You can also get rice and fries if you like.  Definitely a restaurant grade food court place but without the hassle of tipping the server.  Highly recommend this place, the owner is super friendly as well"}
{"text":"I tried their veal ribs once and felt that they were not tender enough, bland and quite greasy at the same time. Don't know why this place gets such high rating from others"}
{"text":"Very good food. It's fresh and cooked right in front of you at the Montreal Trust Food Court. They have a variety of plates ranging from fish and chips to Portuguese chicken served with a nice salad and warm soup. A must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Great quality of steak! No smell of lamb! Kind explanation of menus(you can see the samples!)"}
{"text":"Great resto. Big size portion with lot of variety.  Good place to go in the mall.   Price is ok for the portion. My girlfriend like it very much.  Pleasure place. Recommended  Pros : Lot of choices Tasty Meats lover  Con : You may think a little bit expensive"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancée were given some sample meat to try by the server. After trying the sample, we decided to get one order. Upon getting ready to pay, we realized that the dish was veal meat and came to $28.70. As it was a food court, we expected the cost to be $10-$15. Little did we know, the price would be double- triple our expectations. When I asked where the pricing for this dish was, the cashier told me it's on the signage, which was quite hidden in the corner and in French. If you cannot read French, I would be careful eating here. No complaints about the taste of the food."}
{"text":"For a food court, this place stands out, and practically towers over most. The food is pretty good, (great if you consider the price for steaks, fish, and other hearty meat dishes), and the service is not shabby. The selection is varied, with daily specials. Great lunch and (perhaps) quick dinner place."}
{"text":"pushing sales towards the customers. restaurant price food  in a food.court, if you want to spend between 15 bux to 40 bux there,then it's the place for u!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!!! THIS IS DELICIOUS!!!! Meat is always the answer, it is the reason why I'm not a vegetarian and also why I should be vegetarian because ooooooh it's soooo goooood. I had the beef ribs, so juicy, so soft, so big, so tender, so perfect. Nearly orgasmic. And it's even better when you're hungry like I was. The staff is awesome, meat cooked upon perfection, yes yes. In a shopping mall, I never knew this existed! I am glad I discovered this place. Writing this review makes my mouth water. Mmmmmmmmmmh..... I need more."}
{"text":"Surprising steak place in a food court. Large piece of t-bone. Could barely finish the plate. Came with rice/fries. They let me have some of both and choice of salad or soup. Owner aggressively giving out samples, but that's ok. I was planning on eating there and the samples were tasty. Fries were crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"Couldn't believe to find this gem at a food court inside a shopping mall!  Thanks to Yelp, we found them while shopping in Montreal.  The staff was very pleasant, and had us sample some of their choices.  Wifey and I decided to share two of their specialties.  The Jarret D' Agneau (Lamb Shank) and the Côtes De Veau (Veal Ribs). Both entrees came with yummy rice and veggies.  Each of the meats was juicy and very flavorful!!  I recommend you have them both.   So if you find yourself at this special food court....Search out Fiore Bistro.  I'd be shocked if you did not like them too."}
