{"text":"As usual, a great meal here. However, buyer beware. The added gratuity to the check on our party of six without telling us so the waitress was double tipped. We didn't realize until we were gone. But we enjoyed our meal, great Reuben's, and the waitress was very good. I just feel we should have been told. So, Merry Christmas to our waitress! Please notify us next time. I was giving a generous tip anyway. Personal pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"They make a good Pizza. The bar has booths that always has Pens on. Nice and polite staff."}
{"text":"Walked in hungry and leaving an Italian restaurant hungry....ordered a cheesesteak with cheddar and chips.  I was starving!  Chips were burnt, had to send the sandwich back.  We have been here about 12 times.  Today was the last visit.  The waitress cleared the table and didn't notice that even after the correction I ate less than 80% of my meal.  Best part were the burnt chips"}
{"text":"Great pizza and chix parm sandwich. Also best fried pickles ever. My friends like pierrogie pizza, reuben and seafood bisque.Old style atmosphere. Comfortable fridnds, family. All ages in our area go there- 20s to 70s"}
{"text":"Not bad Italian fare, I went on lunch hour, it was fairly busy but service was still fast: waitress was very nice. I just had a sausage parm, it was good enough to get again. Only complaint: cheap frozen fries."}
