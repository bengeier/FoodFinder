{"text":"Was sat down and ignored, especially by the waitress with nasal ring who wouldn't bat an eye at us but would brush our table as she served the table practically touching ours. I was starting to think we had died because we were invisible to the servers in this joint. We finally asked to get served and our order was finally taken. We watched everyone who sat down after us leaving as our food finally came. At this point we were beyond hunger and scarfed down the food. We were so upset about the service I couldn't tell you how the food was but good luck on your service."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Ordered the custom built veggie burger. There are tons of choices. My friend built a regular burger. I  had a side of sweet potatoes which were super yummy and age had the shoestring fries. She enjoyed them. Went on a whim on a Wednesday evening. Pretty slow but crew was very friendly. It's downtown so parking sucks. I had a strawberry lemonade which doesn't have free refills. I didn't give it 5 stars due to that, parking, and it's a little pricey. Overall fun experience and good food."}
{"text":"Date night dinner on Wednesday.  Service was excellent and we had many questions. Food was quick, delicious and exactly as we ordered. As burger snobs we rate this among the best ever. The onions strings are perfectly done and the fries hot and crisp, perfect to share.  The aioli is excellent and Cabernet mustard.  We will definitely go again and recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to typically post a bad review but I felt like I should spare others the bad experience.  Had been here for lunch prior in the week so thought I would go back for dinner before a show.  Although getting the bill at lunch took way too long figured that wasn't a big deal.  For dinner however it was a calamity of service errors.  30 minutes to get drinks, 45 for food.  Wrong food items delivered to the table to the point we just quit telling them.  45 minutes for our wives drinks then food came intermittently in waves.  Overall some of the worst service ever.  Also my burger was ordered medium and brought out well done.  To the management...... You have a great location and decent food,  get your service together before your out of business.  Also two couples walked out while we were there that were sat when we were and we overheard even people sitting at the bar complaining about service.  Manager did apologize and comp most of our bill, we that is after we actually were billed the correct amounts, as all the happy hour items we ordered were billed in error."}
{"text":"Okay burgers. Took forever to get our order. I wouldn't have minded if the meal was amazing but it wasn't anything special. Don't go here if you have limited time for lunch."}
{"text":"I don't know if the staff would rather be somewhere else or if they are just flat out stupid.  Couldn't get service, everyone that wasn't entirely motionless seemed to be blind.  If you're not hungry and want to have some fun, go in and be amazed at how long you will be ignored before you leave.  Curious why they're open at all.  Can't comment on the food, didn't even see anyone else eating.  Very odd place."}
{"text":"For a $16 lunch... just one person.  A nothing special burger and fries.  I will never go back here and I will tell everyone I know to just to to 5 guys or in and out our mcdonalds.  What a rip off.  I had to put salt and hot sauce on the burger to make it taste like anything.  I have NEVER done that to a burger from a restaurant.  Terrible"}
{"text":"Always love \"The Counter\". Novel choice of additives, buns, cheese, etc. Location was a little sketchy at dinner time, but we didn't have any safety concerns."}
{"text":"Came here without investigating first, was pleasantly surprised.  Food was all excellent and very high quality, staff was beyond friendly.  Kid menu was great. Got the Official Counter burger and coleslaw (which was awesome).  You can also build your own on paper checklists.  Also sauce comes on the side which I love. Will go back for a spiked shake! But omg the place has these really intense LED spotlights, and the music was way too loud."}
{"text":"Awesome build your own burger spot! Had a 1/3 burger, cooked (perfectly) medium, on a brioche bun with herbed goat cheese, organic mixed greens, baby spinach, red onions, apricot sauce, horseradish aoli, garlic aoli and a side of quinoa salad (yay, healthy side!). The sauces come on the side so definitely recommend sampling several!"}
{"text":"I really REALLY enjoyed our food here. Lorenzo, our waiter, was awesome and had a great personality. We came in during a convention in Downtown Phoenix and waited about as long as one would expect to. A miscommunication with the kitchen made out food and appetizers come out at the same time, quite a while after we ordered (again, busy night).   All of these things are worth ignoring for the sake of the food, yet one thing was unacceptable. We were able to apply our $90 groupon to our food, awesome right? Exactly what they are for. But my friends who flew in from out of town, who I bought the lesser groupon for ($30) were denied the opportunity to use theirs. Not okay. Now they have a groupon for a restaurant in a state where they don't even live. I can't get a refund, and though we are frequently in Downtown Phoenix we won't be visiting this place again.   I would also point out that when you ask your customers to wait outside in the heat, you may want to offer them water. Especially when the wait is 40 minutes in 116 degree weather. The last remark I want to make is that it bugged me that we waited that long, and then we were seated on the patio. There was no one out there, and there had been no one out there. Why in the world make us wait if you could have just seated us out there to begin with? We were the first and only ones out there.   Lorenzo, again, you were awesome. Thank you for your hospitality, hopefully they treat you better than they treated us."}
{"text":"Really good basic hamburger! Grunge music over outdoor speakers was a bit distracting. Average price. Good service."}
{"text":"First time in downtown Phoenix and was very happy with the experience. The Counter's burgers are thick and juicy. Quality meat and toppings. The patio was lovely and the \"fire pit\" was very pretty. Only four stars cause the service was a little slow but friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food is good....but it takes forever. Service is slower than slow. Prices are way too high. My sense is they are mismanaged as they seem to have a lot of people working there. The workers appear to be lost. Wait times for a drink refill are also extremely long....and we sat at the bar!   Sign on the door yesterday, June 15th, says they are now closed indefinitely for maintenance issues. I wonder if the city shut them down???  Did they fail an inspection??? Anyone know?  Stay away."}
{"text":"My first experience was not great.  Undercooked burger,  inept waitstaff,  and a horrible wait with only 3 other tables tells me why this place is cutting hours.   Over an hour in and the refire still being wrong for one at our table,  we decided it was time to go. If the drinks weren't so over priced,  this place may be more tolerable, but I doubt even a fountain of adult beverages would save it.   Running out of bison an hour before closing,  30 minutes from order to table,  and a burger that wasn't even as good as Five Guys(which we ended up at after).  Wrong order,  undercooked beef,  refire raw,  severe lack or service (apparently tea is hard to get) makes this a first and last for me.    As a manager,  you'd think a second issue at a table would A. Come by and B. Do more than take 20% off When she DID come the 2nd time,  at our request,  she did try to make it right, but we shouldn't have had to ask.   You'd think that a downtown location would be a flagship,  but this is a sinking ship."}
{"text":"Great burgers.   Love the choices of protein, sauces, fixin's, etc... Well worth the price.  Will be back."}
{"text":"We had the pickle chips they were delicious! Outstanding service, this was our second time there...the strawberry lemonade and Sangria were delightful! I will be back soon.. Give this place a try. Yum!"}
{"text":"The menu has amazing options and the food was incredible! All the appetizers that we ordered were delicious and perfectly cooked. I recommend getting the fried pickles and the fried onion strings--those were phenomenal! I ordered a burger that was delicious and perfectly cooked, even the bun was awesome! We ordered milkshakes too and they tasted amazing. Our server Isaiah did a fantastic job! He was very nice, professional, and attentive. Even a manager came by to check on us and asked if we were satisfied. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A group of very friendly people, 6 of us, decided to swing in here to have a drink before heading to a concert. Ordered a round of drinks when we were first seated, that never showed up. Mitchel, our server, was a nice man. We were told the bartenders were behind. we could see them pretty much the whole time, and within 15 minutes half the place had cleared out.  After these first 15 minutes passed, Another large group was seated. As our food was arriving, I asked the lady delivering food if she could check on our drinks. (we ordered the drinks at 556 pm, it was now 627pm) \"THE BAR IS BACKED UP\"... I looked over and the other party had their drinks already. The manager simply said there was nothing she could do... she said she would have made them herself if she could, which, as a veteran of the food industry, is EXACTLY what she should have done... helped out the bar if they really were behind... I have never worked for a restauraunt that gave priority to anything but drinks... they usually have a higher profit margin than food, and you can serve them faster than food. I had already finished my food, so we asked them to simply cancel the drink order, as time was nearing for our concert. The Hostess was extremely pleasant as well. However, they need a manager with something other than a title. The food tasted good, but was lukewarm. Another table had gotten up and left, and they told us good luck, it was just taking too long... so sad. This place has good potential, and hoepfully someday I can try one of their Counterballs!!"}
{"text":"Yummy hamburger. I love being able to build my own hamburger from scratch also. They have so many options to put on your burger. The burgers are cooked just right and have the right amount of seasoning to them. I also really liked their chili as I am not a big fan of chili. The flavors were so good. There were not a lot of beans in the chili which was kind of bothersome to my co-worker but I loved the flavor. It is a little pricey for a hamburger but you can add a lot of stuff before you have to pay extra. Their salads are very tasty also and you can also build your own salad. They have shoestring fries that are light and crispy Yummy"}
{"text":"Currently sitting at \"The Counter\" visiting my Mom from NYC.  Ice cream decent, lots of fun options.  Dude behind counter was slightly rude. In a rush to leave and acting as if my order was an inconvenience. Just wanted to have a nice ice cream date with my mom before flying home tonight. I understand having a long day, but fake it till you make it at least.  Hopefully you have a more pleasant experience than us :)"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. For heaven's sake it's only a burger and fries and it takes an hour to serve? 15 minutes to get the absolutely worst monitor imaginable. (No mint, no simple syrup.) It went back needles to say. Burger's OK. Nothing special. Positives; Dwayne our server is awesome. Very attentive considering the disarray and confusion that permeates that place"}
{"text":"Went here the day it opened on our lunch hour. Luckily, we can take more than an hour without worry because it took a solid hour and a half. Naturally, there are headaches to be expected with a brand new establishment but the entire experience was chaotic. We were \"helped\" by no less than four different servers. Somehow they forgot to put our orders in and lost mine completely. Kudos to the manager for comping our meal but somehow that still does not seem like enough. The burger I received had very few of the items I selected, was cooked well beyond what I asked and I received the incorrect fries.   This place has a lot of potential being amidst so many office buildings and right off the light rail but they really need to be more organized. It's going to be awhile before I feel like trying this place again."}
{"text":"I just want to say that this place has done a full 360! (Thank god) The management is now awesome, the staff is literally the most humble and genuine group of people you can meet (example Rachel, Caity, Paige, Tammy, Dwayne, Joe, the list goes onandonandonandon) I'm biased, I used to work here, but it's totally worth a stop in. You'll meet great people, you got joe & his crew in the back making wonderful food and you won't find an atmosphere like the one Rachel & Sean create for you. Loooooooove everyone there and it's definitely the spot if you're downtown for the day or in town for the weekend, you won't be able to regret it"}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious burger! Had a vegetarian build-your-own burger, side salad and fries. Burger was awesome and fries were yummy. Waiter was very attentive and kept refilling drinks. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"***LAST UPDATE***  Went to the Counter to give it another shot on Sunday 12/27. We arrived shortly after their opening at 11am and found that they don't open at 11. Apparently the website has not been updated (There are no hour signs on the business) and after looking at reviews, you really should call ahead to find out if they're open or not. Not a problem, we walked around until they eventually opened at 12.  As I was sitting there at our table, I overheard the table behind me asking the server a question. The table was asking if there was a good time to come for lunch because when he stopped by the previous week, they were advised it would be an hour wait to put an order in. I had to chuckle to myself. Based on my previous experience and other reviews, apparently things have not been addressed. I understand the occasional rush that you're not prepared for, but when it is the norm, there is a problem. The server advised the table that they can try on Thursday...lol.  Now the part that counts, how was the food? It was really good! We ordered two burgers, two sides, one adult shake, and one normal shake. Food quality is really good, the cost is high (opinion), but definitely no complaints on taste.   The Counter has been open for long enough to work out the bugs, and hasn't. The novelty of a new place downtown will wear off and unless they address some of the serious shortfalls, I cannot imagine it can survive.   ******  The GM contacted me yesterday and was very pleasant. He explained the situation, explained steps to address it, and convinced me to try it again. Although I still haven't tasted the food, the menu looks great and numerous friends have vouched for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Service was bad. Server kept blaming it on the bartender and cooks....(I'm talking  about 4 different times throughout our terrible experience). The drinks took 15+ min to come and were wrong when they arrived. I ordered a michelada with a salted rim and was given a mimosa with a salted rim. Then, yet again, the server blamed the bartender. The server brought me my drink. HE should know what a michelada looks like compared to an orange bubbly mimosa. My husband's \"bloody pig\" (bloody Mary with bacon) was in a HUGE 24 oz glass...full to the rim with what tasted like v8. There was very little ice and one lonely little piece of bacon floating around in it. Im guessing there must have been 1oz of vodka in there somewhere too although I'm not sure. The server recommended asking them to make it short next time. C'mon. If you're going to throw something like that on the menu, require it's done right from the start. The drink was crap. The $15 bison burger was 4 bites for my husband. Sides must be added for $3 each, no burger or sandwich comes with fries. The place was dead when we stopped in for dinner and it took 40 minutes then get food on the table. My grilled cheese w bacon was all bread with cheese that had already returned to its hard greasy \"been sitting out for a while under the lamp\" stage. I ordered blue cheese on my side salad and it was brought with ranch with blue cheese crumbled added because they \"don't have blue cheese\" Uh, ok. I liked the fried pickles, that's about it and its a cute place. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes for the waiter to take our order and it was not even busy.  Ordered a grilled cheese  and it was medicore and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Service was poor, watier unintentive, food came out cold and took forever! On topof that paid 15+ for a cold burger and fries. Oh ya they also forgot to add the extras I requested."}
{"text":"So disappointed with this restaraunt. We waited 40 minutes to get our food, we both ordered build your own burgers and a side of fries. Our meat was SO over cooked its was hard to even eat it was so dry, and nothing of what I ordered/paid for was on my burger. The toppings that were on my burger, were not fresh. The concept sounds amazing, but for the cost, service, and quality of the food there are too many other places to go spend your money."}
{"text":"Very bad experience.  Waited 55 minutes for lunch.  It never came.  We ended up leaving.  A few minutes prior to leaving we heard at least two other groups complaining of the same thing, both of which left right before us without having been served.   Waitress was nice and apologetic, but it wasn't much consolation after waiting your entire lunch hour and having to go back to work without eating at all.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a trade show and this restaurant was a quick walk from hotel.. Sorry folks 105 is just damn hot...being an east coaster was thinking this was a local version of 5Guys... My tastebuds are immensely happy I was oh so wrong... Not sure how this place is not a 5 star... But all I can say is bison burger, grilled veggies, shoestring fries... BOOM .. Walk away full and with your tongue wanting to know when ur coming back....winter I keep telling it.. Definitely winter.   Or if ur old Skool....two thumbs up with a twist in Z formation."}
{"text":"*Point of view: Age 18-21* Came in 20 minutes after they open on a Thursday and hardly anyone was there, just about 2-3 people were seated. Servers and host were nice. Thought this place would be a really good place to eat for lunch but my mind has changed and will not be eating here. Yes the food is mediocre but for the price I would honestly waste my money on fuddruckers famous hamburgers (where you can actually make your own burger and pile on as much pickles, tomatoes, jalapeños, etc). The meat was a bit hard to chew on. Fries on the other hand were exceptionally good. But a $40 check for just 2 burgers and fries is too much. Yes it's in downtown phx but I would rather chose a different lunch/dinner place."}
{"text":"I was there on Saturday with a group of 8 friends and we never got water, drinks or food after being there for almost an hour. In fact as we were leaving the waiter screamed \"let them leave\" Very Classy. I have sent a letter to their Corp office but I don't expect a reply."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times. Two out of three I didn't get to eat there. Pretty bad odds in my opinion. Make sure you have a back up plan if you do try going.   The first time, they had recently changed their hours and I showed up 15 minutes after the new closing. If you do decide to go here, I highly recommend calling ahead to make sure they will actually be open... That time, I spoke with the manager and he was actually very kind and professional. He offered me a burger on the house the next time. I thought I'd give them a second chance... He said that business was slow in the evenings, that's why they cut the hours. I went back, earlier this time, a couple days later, sat at the bar and enjoyed a great burger and a bananas foster milkshake that was pretty stellar. The bartender was really fun to chat with and service was good.   So I thought they redeemed themselves and the first time was just a fluke and took my friend there for his birthday last night... Problems again. They had a sign handwritten on the door that they were closed til 8 for a private party. But there were people sitting at the bar and the hostess said we could order at the bar. Cool. That's what we wanted to do anyway. There was a couple guys on our right, not part of private party, eating. Another couple on the left put in a food order just as we were deciding on drinks. A different bartender than the last time I was there made my drink then comes and tells us the manager says there will be no food orders for \"a while\". It's 7:12... We ask what time will food be available? The private party has ended early in the meantime and they're clearing out. He says maybe 7:30 or 8, he's not sure.   We were confused and asked to speak to the manager. He didn't logically explain why food couldn't be made, since the private party was done. I asked if the kitchen staff was on break? Nope. Were they out of food? Nope. This \"acting manager\" Javier also refused to provide any reason as to why the people next to us got served and we wouldn't be. The other couple whose order was actually taken canceled their order and decided to leave when we did. I don't know if their food was being cooked or not but the bartender had taken their order and didn't tell them that no food was being cooked so I have a sneaking suspicion if we waited a few more minutes their food would have shown up... That couple said that they had problems when they came here before too and heard other people they know say the same thing.   I felt like the acting manager really didn't care about this place as a business. I asked him if he had any vested interest in the business or if the owner was on premises. He refused to answer. I asked for a business card. He said they don't have those, which I knew was a blatant lie, since I had that incident with the hours of operation the first time I came, the other manager had given me one then with the promise of a burger on the house. I don't even think this manager Javier understood what a vested interest is. An owner manager would have found a way to accommodate patrons rather than alienating them, or at least made a genuine apology and offered something for the inconvenience. We even asked if we could just do a to-go order. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the manager here has any real business knowledge and the customer service skills of a string bean. The rest of the staff seemed to be intimidated and embarrassed by him. If I owned this place, I'd fire him on the spot. He was defensive and stubborn rather than recognizing in the span of 10 minutes he was losing 4 people's business permanently. Who knows how often he acts like this? I'd be willing to bet they have a high turnover rate on staff just from their reaction to what happened too us.    I'm sad to write this review because I actually like the idea of this restaurant but with a stubborn, unprofessional manager at the helm and inconsistent hours of operation, I will not waste my time trying to go there again. I feel bad for the staff there because they were all very nice and much more empathetic than the manager who's the one that is supposed to be setting the example for them."}
{"text":"In town for a week and went to this spot 3 times it was worth every trip. The services was great and not to mention the burger and beers. The staff was great, Rachel was so good she will be my standard for a bartender  now on."}
{"text":"Just had a late lunch - the food was awesome,  but the service was horrible, except for the host she was GREAT,  she service us more than are waiter."}
{"text":"LOVED it. The create your own burger had amazing choices. I went with goat cheese and beef 1/3 burger combined almost every type of pepper available! Fried pickels were bomb. Shakes were eh but over all the place has great burger options and service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Food was really good. We had custom burgers, regular fries,sweet potatoe fries and a milk shake. The burgers were on Brioche buns and they were great. Only complaint about the burger was the $.50 charge for thousand island dressing. Both types of fries were really good!  I would have given 5 stars, but the kitchen's timing was way off.  The milk shake too a really long time to come out.  Also our burgers and sweet potatoe fries came out together, but the regular fries did not come out until we wer half way through everything else. Also my expensive thousand island dressing was left off my burger and I had to ask for it.  Fix the kitchen problems by the next time and I will gladly give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Went today and was closed after drive ing for a half hour and paying  $1.50 for parking"}
{"text":"Great burgers ... But more importantly, great service. I left my credit card on the table and Leon N. - our server - ran us down 2 blocks away to give it back to me. Very much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Service was a little slow but the food was amazing.  I had the Bacon BBQ Cheseeburger and it was delicious.  The sweet potatoes fries are the bomb."}
{"text":"Took the family there prior to a Suns game.  My 11 year old son is a huge hamburger fan so he ordered the 1 pound burger.  It was huge but he ate the whole thing.  That is 1 lb after it is cooked.  Wow.  The entire family enjoyed the burgers.  The sweet potato fries were good and so were the shakes.  The service was awesome as several members checked on us.  Location is great and the patio out back was nice."}
{"text":"Would have given five star as the food and waiter was great. We were there Last Saturday night 18th July. The girl at the entrance needs some training.  She was not very professional or welcoming. She made us wait 20'mins even though 4 tables were open and then said no to my request to take the empty booth. Other than that I will go back and recommend.  Food and waiters service was very good."}
{"text":"One star only because  none is not an option but that only one star was earned by our server. Despite our long wait and terrible food she was a sweet girl.  Poor staffing. Plenty of servers wandering around not serving. 15+ tables opened but had to wait over 20 min for a table that had been open the entire time we waited.  The hostess explanation for all the empty tables and 20 min wait to be seated was that a large party arrived and they couldn't keep up in the kitchen.  So, the restaurant has the space but not the ability to serve a  full house?  That is clearly a problem already. Then the food took forever and to top it off terrible. The \"well\" burger was burnt! I mean black burnt. The \"medium\" was over cooked and dry. And don't bother  with the dessert. We will not be back even with the \" generous\" 20% off our next meal note from the manager for the long wait and terrible food. Glad we went on a groupon deal and not paid full price!  Cross this one off your \"must try list\". Trust me!"}
{"text":"I tried this new place out today and as a downtown resident I think it brings something new to the area where you can enjoy good beer (none of that Miller and Bud light nonsense) and great burgers! You can even make the burgers \"healthier\" by choosing different buns, protein, sauces, veggies.. Etc. you can even choose the Bowl option instead of the bun. Love that they are open until 9pm. The staff was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"A friend brought me by this place, he is vegan and yes they offer vegan options!  They have a pretty large menu, and if you're not feeling any of the items that they have to offer they had a wide array of patties, cheese, bread and toppings for you to choos from, so that you can customize your own buger!  The location of the restaurant is great, the lightrail is right in front of it!"}
{"text":"Convenient downtown location. Great trifecta grilled cheese and fantastic fries. If you go, ask to be seated at one of Dwaynes tables. He is awesome and makes the place!"}
{"text":"Good food but slow (and somewhat rude) service, high prices and really loud noise level (we sat next to each other at the counter and had to shout) make me give it only 2 stars. The delicious sciracha (sp?) Fries are what kicked it up to 2 stars from 1. Won't go back I'm afraid."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix recently going to a concert at Talking Stick Resort Arena and was staying downtown. The Counter was convenient walking distance from our hotel and to the concert venue so we went here before the show. I usually go to The Counter on trips home to the OC. It's always a place I can get something to eat when I'm with the meat-eaters in my life. I pretty much always get the same thing: a veggie burger with caramelized red onions, roasted red peppers, and avocado with a side of barbecue sauce on a ciabatta roll. I love their shoestring fries and sweet potato fries equally. It's always a toss up which to get but if you get the big side order to share, you can go 50/50. It's become easier to order at The Counter, as they are clearly marking all the vegan options now. I do wish they had a regular bun that was vegan because the ciabatta roll is a little tougher and the veggie patty usually crumbles as you're eating it. I know they are house-made, but I think the patty recipe could be tweaked a little bit to not fall apart so much. They are tasty nonetheless but it makes for a messy burger!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I was part of a large party and the restaurant wasn't crazy busy. The server came by right away when we joined our friends, and that attentiveness was present the whole meal which was nice. The most important aspect of my ahi tuna salad was, of course, the ahi tuna - which was simply butchered. I ordered a full pound ($18) of ahi tuna (plus $4). I thought it would be nice to splurge and even share with anyone who wanted to sample it. When she asked how I would like my tuna, I probably looked confused. Tuna is generally seared and left \"raw\" in the center. I just answered \"seared\" and when she said it might be mostly raw I told her that would be amazing, that's exactly how I like it. She came back again and said the ginger sesame dressing wasn't available, which wasn't a big deal but seems worth mentioning. When everyone's food finally started coming out, mine was among the third wave of dishes. I'm still so disappointed. My tuna was like scrambled eggs, barely raw and diced. It was clumpy and salty, the color of canned tuna and piled on top of a barely there salad with only a couple toppings I ordered and some toppings I didn't. To be honest, I work in the service industry and know I should have simply sent it back and explained the problem. But I just couldn't believe it was served to me in the first place. I ate what I could of it, paid, and left. I tried to make the best of it, because who knows? Maybe that's the way they think it's acceptable to be served. It wasn't worth arguing about it in front of all my friends who were happy with their food. I just can't believe that a restaurant with The Counter's reputation would have served me that slop in the first place - and I'm not one to be overly critical of restaurants or their fare. It should have been done right or not served to me at all."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong. The food was great.  What was not was the almost hour waiting for our food when there were only two other people eating there.  I honestly wouldn't of written a bad review if it wasn't for our server pushing refills on us, then come time for the bill and us being charged almost $4 for every drink refill. I would of asked for water after my first drink. It's like lying to your customers when you don't inform them refills cost extra. How did two drinks and two burgers cost $50? Mind blown. Will never be back."}
{"text":"So good! The vegan vegetable burger was delicious and soooo fresh! Sweet potato fries were amazing. So many choices and everything was great! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes for the hostess to seat my husband and I. Finally get a table and wait another 20 mins. I ask a server if they can take our order, I am told that they are trying to figure out who should be our server but she can't help us... then proceeds to take the order of the table that was just seated behind us. I could understand if they were busy but there was over 20 open tables on Friday night and they did not appear to be short staffed. Horrible... we left hungry."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place & was slightly disappointed due to the kitchen staff.   Pros: burger options are pretty much endless -other options besides just a burger -great fries & milkshakes  Cons: burgers come out extremely undercooked (I was warned of this prior to ordering from a friend). I like my meat well-done so I made sure to make note that I wanted mine well done, it was medium-well at best. The outsides were cooked but the entire inside was pink & bloody. I was also missing many of the toppings I opted for with the \"build your own burger\". My waiter did notice that I was displeased and had the manager come over to try and make things right.   (Note:they have a chart on their menu of the different options on how to order the burger with descriptions of how much or little pink it should have. Making it less debatable on how the burger should or should not look.)  It primarily seems to be an issue with the kitchen staff and proper cooking temperatures & attention to details."}
{"text":"We were passing by this town from Sedona to L.A. Saw the deal in groupon and thought the concept of 'build your own' burger sounds wonderful. Sure enough, these guys didn't disappoint us. Shout out to Jeff who is very courteous and attentive. He knew we were using groupon yet that didn't discourage him. On the contrary, I think they're striving to get better review so they try their best.   Food was great. Got the build it burger with 1/2 lb beef medium and came out perfect- hot and juicy. We also had the sweet potato fries (yummy!), French fries (meh!), and quinoa salad (probably could use a spray of light dressing for taste). They're key lime is tasty too. Apple crumble is a bit dry."}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service. Decided to try it after even reading all the reviews about the long wait times and bad service. Well everything happened to us that we're reviewed. Had a 20 min wait even though the restaurant was empty. Was very understaffed and could use more training.  Took 45 min to get our food and then once we got our food our custom burgers were customize between my wife's burger and mine. She had half of my stuff and I had half of hers. Very bad experience and don't plan on returning.  Heed the warning in the reviews!!"}
{"text":"Had the BBQ**2 burger but salad style. Imagine a burger patty without a bun on a bed of lettuce. It was good but not amazing and not worth the price. The best part was the veggie skewers.  My sister got a regular burger and liked it. I'll always try a place twice. Will post another status if my thoughts change."}
{"text":"tried this brand new Counter Burger this week and wow...what a great burger. Had the Chili fries and they were terrific. Top it off with a delicious shake and what a meal and the portions are large. I realize they just opened and service was little slower but let's give the staff a break, it will get better. The patio is extremely large and a great place for a after work cocktail. Have to try that next. All in all this is a great location with food that will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Great place for build your own burger. Always leave me very full. They have a great variety or alcoholic drinks and milk shakes"}
{"text":"While the food is acceptable, this restaurant is ill-prepared to handle large crowds.  The restaurant refused to seat my family and I on two separate occasions because of insufficient staffing.  In both instances, my family arrived 30+ minutes before closure.  On the last occasion, the waitress told me they were no longer seating customers due to a party of 18.  When we told the waitress we didn't mind waiting, she still said no.  When we asked to see the assistant manager, she seemed irked when I told her it was customary to service customers who arrive during posted hours.  The manager made it quite clear through her demeanor and attitude she was more interested in maintaining established business hours than serving customers.  When I talked to the restaurant manager the following day, his attitude was also less than stellar.  Though he took my contact information and promised a prompt reply, he never called back.  By all accounts, The Counter appears to be a restaurant that became an overnight success - a proposition that appears to mean they believe the supply of new customers will offset those who don't come back."}
{"text":"Waitress was very nice. Quick service and good food. Chili fries were great. All around pretty good"}
{"text":"Holy cheeseburgers Batman. I was deeply impressed by this place and will bookmark it for future phoenix trips.  My S/O and I were in town for comic con, and both of us being gluten free (I have celiac disease, he is by choice), finding safe places to eat that does not involve some form of salad has become an art. We happened to walk up to this place to glance at the menu and noticed that they had a gluten free bun. Upon acquiring at the bar, a very knowledgeable bartender offered us both gluten free menus.   I had the \"bison is Gouda\" on a gf bun with the Parmesan fries. And, yeah, I'm gonna be coming back for one of them. Absolutely delicious. My S/O had the red eye (or something like that) and loved it. The garlic aioli and the home made thousand island sauce is amazing and completed the burger.  I really enjoyed the angry pineapple drink as well and was excited to see that they had angry orchard  was on tap and they had a gf beer in bottles.   Very cool vibe. It's right next to the light rail, so every time it passes the floor vibrates, which makes if feel like one of those train side diners, while maintaining a new age spin. We loved it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fast service.  Friendly server (Troy) with good recommendation.  Fresh food.  Perfectly cooked bison burger.  Fries could've been hotter but just as i like them,  thin and crispy.  Last stop in Phoenix before heading home.  Glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"Had the Mediterranean salad (a Greek salad with turkey patty on top).  i should have told them how I like my turkey patties (well done) and it wasn't.  But it also wasn't seasoned.  I asked the waitress was it seasoned, she said the cook seasons it with salt and pepper...it didn't even have that.  It was blah! The salad had cucumbers, olives, tomatoes, lettuce, but the dressing that accompanied it was not flavorful...it was too salty and it did not complement the turkey.  I did have a side order of shoestring fries which was the highlight of my meal.  My friend had a regular classic burger...it looked good, but she didn't have any comment on how it tasted. it was just okay.  I have been to Zinburger and never had a bad piece of meat.  Maybe The Counter has good shakes and desserts."}
{"text":"Just came back for a second chance at this place since we couldn't get seated the last time we visited. This place is NOT Impressive. Several items on the menu have not been update so make sure to ask before ordering a burger if you expect the sauce that is described on the menu to actually be on it. Horrible kids burgers also, basically just a blob of carcinogens. I would not recommend this place to anyone for food, and without groupon I doubt this place would still be open."}
{"text":"This place has the best burger on the planet..ridiculously awesome. I've been here three times in the last week. And the veggie skewers are the best thank you!"}
{"text":"Good food and milkshakes. The waitress I had was really nice. The only reason i gave it 3 stars is because it took 45 minutes to get our food and my order was wrong and it took another 45 minutes just to get a burger with avocado on it. The kitchen staff needs to get it together."}
{"text":"I'm kind of surprised by the bad reviews as we had an excellent experience. We came here for dinner before a concert and both the food and the service was great! I guess it is a little pricey but the burgers we got were huge and dining in the city is generally a little more. Either way I would come back in a heartbeat.  No complaints here!"}
{"text":"I gave this place the benefit of the doubt despite the Yelp reviews. For a place that prides itself on complex customizable burgers, they messed up my and my wife's orders a lot. I was missing one 1 out of 4 toppings. She was missing 2 out of 5. Instead of peanut sauce, she was given extremely got salsa. The waitress said they were actually out of peanut sauce and that they were thinking the salsa would be good enough.  In addition, there was a piece of plastic in my water and several black hairs in my wife's salad.  I would not return and would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Easily worst service I've ever received. Waited 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us at the door. Then another 20 minutes to be sat. Only half the restaurant was filled. Hostess reasoning was because they are backed up on food. At least let us sit down and order a drink. Finally sat down. Ordered our food at the same time server greeted us. Received food after 45 minutes of ordering.  Had to take it in to go boxes to make our show.  No management oversight. I feel like no one here cares or knows the basics of urgency, as well as customer service. Will never go back. Great location though. Will go out of business in my opinion. Put a restaurant here that has a bit of competency and cares about customer service."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Good service. Perfect french fries and enjoyed my veggie club. BUUUT was disappointed that there was only a changing table in the women's restroom so my husband had to bring our son back for me to change. Very trendy but obviously not when it comes to gender roles (because, you know, only women are fit to change their kids' diapers)."}
{"text":"Great place in the middle of downtown Phoenix! Many menu choices and the adult milkshakes are amazing! I had a simple build your own salad but it was very good and I could tell my chicken was grilled fresh. Had great service from the girl behind the bar, didn't catch her name but she had blonde hair. A bit pricy, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Loved this place....best burger (if you do it right) in Phoenix!!  Building your own burger is a great idea as long as you have the right pieces to make it work.....and this place does. Service was really great and the food was incredible....what more could you want?  Do yourself a favor, get the Groupon and get yourself a righteous burger!"}
{"text":"Waited 30-40 minutes for our food. Every so often the waiter assured us the burgers were almost ready... After four times of this we just asked for the bill on the two drinks. They told us not to worry about it and we left.  Not sure what to think... Maybe we were there only people in the entire place unlucky enough to not get food? Everybody else was getting served. I don't think I'll give this place another shot based on the other negative reviews I'm seeing. I'd rather eat!"}
{"text":"I wish I had had a burger! I'm trying to watch my weight, so I went with a Cobb salad bowl with chicken. It was pretty good!! I also shared shoestring fries with my fiancé which were good, but slightly too salty. Fun atmosphere and good service. Would definitely return to try a hamburger!"}
{"text":"New to the area and decided to walk down the block to see what was what.  I had seen the Counter while on the Light Rail but never stopped in.  Post lunch emptiness aside, the bison burger was AWESOME!  Great customer service as well.  I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Over priced- if you do the custom option you pay for everything.. Each roping, bun, sauce, cheese.. Then there are premium topping that cost even more. If you order off the menu you are still looking at a $12 burger with no fries those are $3 more.  The service- it was ok. Nothing special but no problems either.   The food- again didn't leave me wanting to come back for the price. No special favors.   Location- the inside is great. Clean (it's new it should be). Huge down fall they do not validate parking! If you come and meet some one for lunch you are in $6 if you park at city scape so try for a meter."}
{"text":"The food we got was good, however they did mess up our order in that one of our party of four first got the wrong food then after an hour finally brought it out. Three of us ate, but since we had a concert to go to, we had to tell them to take it away. They offered to give us a meal to go, but we couldn't take it into the concert event and they offered to comp the meal that didn't make it out on time, but since we were trying to use a Groupon for four, that wasn't going to work. They comped the cheapest item on the bill instead of the meal that never made it in time. After expressing this additional error to the manager he agreed to comp the whole bill.  The bad part about all of this is there wasn't that many customers in the place at the time. The positive note was our meal was free and the food we got was good. It was simply a bad night for staff. We will try again some day when we have more time."}
{"text":"Great burger place with a ton of options! I customized a burger and had the sweet potato fries and loved every bit of it. Really large portions here."}
{"text":"Alex T was very unresponsive and generally subpar as a server. We ordered a drink and it took 25 minutes and then we had to ask the bartender (who was very helpful). The service aside, the food was meh. The bathrooms were also repulsive (horrible smells and cleanliness). Best to avoid."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened tonight but it took 15 minutes to get drinks.  They said the ice cream was too frozen to make a shake.  But, the couple that was Sat after us got shakes :/ I would go somewhere else..."}
{"text":"I've never been so fired up to write a review before. For those of you sticking around for me to say something bad about this place... Get out!  I have been to this place time and time again and have not been disappointed... Only by the fact of how much food I cannot fit into my body.  I always get the mini burgers on happy hour and a few blue moons. Those mini burgers are surprisingly filling.  I have had sweet potato fries too and they were delicious. I've also had the cake batter shake which was super great too. If you are of age, you should definitely try it with the vanilla/a whipped cream flavored shot. I tried the deviled eggs too, which are amazing. How many bars offer that? Yeah. None--get outta here! :) check out the happy hour for sure!  I'm usually waited on by Nick (I believe his name is). I was waited on tonight 2/27/16 by a different bartender, who was equally as awesome. The hostess I've seen before other times as well and she's always friendly. Their customer service is great. The fact that the hostess and bartender recognize me is an awesome feeling because most places don't have that recognition anymore.  Everyone is nice and chats when they are able to, which makes you feel \"at home\".   Here's where I get upset... A party of 12 people rolled in on a Saturday night (tonight 2/27/16) and were told they would have a 10 minute wait. The party was annoyed. Are you serious?? That's far better than anywhere else for wait time. Also, to the party of 12... If you cannot wait ten minutes for a table and want burgers (but have no patience) --that's unfortunate, as burgers take some time to cook. Unless you want that burger out in less than 5... AKA raw on your plate!!    ***Also, to parties greater than five people... Please reserve tables. Your upset at restaurants is most likely due to your lack of planning (even giving a heads up of 10 minutes to the place you're going to is a help)... Especially on a Saturday night.   Another party made my faith in humanity disappear, yet again when they couldn't wait 5 minutes for a table. Yes-- there are \"so many empty tables\". But if there isn't enough staff to manage those tables, you won't be receiving great service. I mean, it's just common sense.  Then you will only be complaining about your \"subpar service\" (probably here on Yelp).  Furthermore, I would like to mention that this is my first Yelp review, as I felt obligated to defend the honor of a local restaurant. I come here after work on weekends and have never been treated poorly. The prices are always reasonable and the food has never been anything but great. The staff here is super friendly and deserve nothing but the same from its customers.  Two thumbs up. And I'll be back for a cold pint and burgers soon :)"}
{"text":"We had a large group visit this Phoenix location and we were given excellent, prompt, and personalized service. Tammy and Caitlin were star servers! The food was tasty and very filling. Great experience!!"}
{"text":"This Counter is a mediocre burger joint that allows you to customize your burgers with toppings and sauces to your liking.   Pros: Great service, good location, and a very friendly staff.  They offer a groupon where you save 50% off after 4pm which is a great deal.   Cons: The wings tasted as if they were frozen and the burgers were just okay.   For the price I couldn't go wrong, but I definitely will not be returning. There are much better burger spots in town."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the Purist burger 1/2 lb. Well done. He said it was phenomenal. I ordered the veggie club and parmesan fries. The bread on my sandwhich was overbuttered and extremely hard. The parmesan fries were very salty and ice cold. It was not even at half capacity and we waited so long. Nice server. Nice. This place was worth a try. Spur of the moment thing but I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"This little spot will hopefully become popular. Drinks were nicely done. Food need a little work service .... Well They just opened so.... I'm hoping it gets better. The veggie burger was great! The regular burgers slightly under done. Not sure but I think the fries were frozen not fresh and they were out of the onion strings for the toppings. Pickle chips were yummy"}
{"text":"First off, my friend and I went on a quiet Saturday in July. It was quiet and didn't seem like the food took long. I ordered the the Counter Cobb salad, which our waitress explained it was a burger without the bun. It was delicious with sweet potato fries and I recommend it. Yum!! My friend ordered the southwest salad and she said it was good. I would recommend this place. The waitress was attentive and checked on us many times. I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"They served one of the best burgers I have ever had.  I ordered medium rare, as I like my beef to moo a little and it was actually rare enough for me, which is rare. I think I might be a werewolf, but that is neither here nor there.  The pretzel bun was delicious, as was the sauce I don't remember.  I would have rated them 5 fat stars, but had to deduct 1/2 star for price being kind of high and another 1/2 star for not having wheelbarrow service to roll me out of there after I ate the whole ginormous burger by myself, which was rare."}
{"text":"Tried this place because it was near our hotel, placed our order and received our food shortly after...they got my burger and my coworkers burger all mixed up breads were swapped toppings all wrong ..but being hungry we ate, mgr came out and asked about it being wrong. ..just said sorry...probably won't eat there again...."}
{"text":"Damn Good Burgers! Highly recommend.  Good Service and clean.  Can't wait to try for happy hour.  Had a burger with blue cheese on a pretzel bun and their BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this spot since it opened and finally go the opportunity today.  Was hoping for a better experience as I live and work downtown.  The food was good but very expensive for what you get.  All sandwiches are al carte so sides are extra.  Plan on spending a minimum of $10 for a burger or chicken sandwich and then another $3 for a side.  The place was busy so I sat at the bar.  I had the BYO (build your own) chicken sandwich.  They didn't tell me I needed to fill out the menu form in order to put my order in.  In fact, I was ignore for the first ten minutes I sat there waiting for someone to acknowledge me.  Once I got my drink, I filled out the order form and then waiting another 5 minutes for the bartender to pick it up and put the order in.  I had to flag him down for this.  My food came out rather quickly and it was good.  The sweet potato fry's where OK but I only got half an order as the server who brought them out spilled half on the floor.  He offered to bring me more but at this point I was running out of time.  The chicken sandwich was good and there are quite a few toppings to choose from on the BYO.  Another pet peeve of mine is when I am not offered a refill on my drink.  My water glass was empty for half the meal and the bartender never acknowledged or even asked if I needed anything else. I attempted to get his attention but was ignored.  I also had to ask another server to ring up the check as the bartender also failed to pick up my bill and credit card which was laying in plain view.  After tax and tip, the bill was over $16 dollars (and I only drank water)   I believe there are better value restaurants in the downtown area with better food and lower prices and much better service."}
{"text":"So this was my first time here and it was surprisingly good. I wasn't in the mood for burgers so I had a buffalo chicken sandwich and that was good. One thing I did learn is that I hate blue cheese. It was in my sandwich and oh my god I wanted to cry. But I just took out the blue cheese and the sandwich is good afterwards. Let me talk about the Starters we had....they were delicious. It was nothing fancy but it was so good! We had sweet potato fries and onion strings. The sauces they gave for the fries and strings were what made it so delicious. If there's one thing I would go back for it would be the fries and strings....silly, i know. But overall this place is great. We went on a Friday night half an hours before closing and the staff were really nice, it wasn't busy at all ( because it was close to closing time), and me and family enjoyed our meal and drinks."}
{"text":"Good burger, good concept of building your own burger with lots of choices. Pricy for a burger. The fries were too salty to eat. The bartender offered to get a new batch and took tjem off the bill. He also gave me a coupon for a free appetizer, so I may try it again."}
{"text":"Let me start, if you're going to as a burger shop serve fries a la carte. Well then they better be a great spud!!  I have to say the fries were over priced cold and soggy. The burger was dry and fries were not up to par. The burger isn't the star here.  Over priced and not worth the money I spent.  The waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Excited to try the place looked awesome great atmosphere, right next to the light rail sounded and felt like New York. Until we got seated, after 20 min of sitting I finally asked if we had a waitress! Waitress said she would ask the hostess ok cool 10 min later our waiter should up 15 min later we got our drinks 30 mins later our food and after waiting 10 more min I asked for our frys that he had forgotten about! Refilled our drinks only after I waved him down. The cherry on top is when I got the wrong change for my dinner and had to wait again! So 1 hour 25 min later I'm walking out from a dinner that cost me 60 bucks for 3 of us from an average burger joint!!! Probably won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is hit or miss. Seemed a little rough when it first opened but is slowly getting better"}
{"text":"Came here to eat before a concert and sitting here the restaurant is 1/2 empty and cannot seem To get any service. People lined up waiting to get in left because no one was getting seated. Waitress was nice but service was the slowest I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and each time my food was overcooked.  For the price you'd think someone in the kitchen would be capable of cooking a medium buger. The manager and staff were very nice and took care to make sure the second burger was cooked correctly.  I give them 3 stars for customer service, but doubt I'll go back for a 3rd try. Thanks anyway!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try something new. It seemed like the perfect place to take are kids before a comedy show. We were kindly seated by the hostess. We waited about 5 minutes until she returned and told us that nobody would able to see us for 15 minutes because they were too busy. We thought were being punked. Meanwhile, the restaurant was only half way full. We figured this must be a mix up and asked for the manager. He confirmed that we had to leave or wait. Strange situation. Poorly run. The manager wasn't even nice about it but the hostess was pleasant. We obviously left and will never return. Rather give our biz to someone who truly wants it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I will definitely be coming back!! The restaurant location and overall atmosphere was great! In the heart of the downtown area close to Chase Field, Talking Sticks Arena and City Scape.  The menu might seem simple, but looking at the featured items, you have some excellent choices! If nothing grabs your eyes, you can build your own. The choices are outstanding!! Our burgers were cooked to perfection and the portions were great.  My wife and I ordered the Korean BBQ burger and the Red Eye. Totally amazing flavors!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great ! I had a grilled chicken breast plain and turkey chili.Food came out fast.Bartenders are real nice and good at their jobs ! I would definitely come back again and I don't say that too often !"}
{"text":"VEGAN I ordered a build your own burger  -vegan patty -vegan cheese -siracha sauce -spinach -veggies -pinapple  SO SO SO GOOD"}
{"text":"Burger was cooked to perfection...onion strings were delightful.  There was minimal traffic when we came, and the service was spot on.  Great little location on the corner of Adams and Central. Cool downtown spot."}
{"text":"My son has been here before, so we decided to give it a try. Krista, the hostess was so friendly, she knew much about the menu which helped us out in deciding what to order. I had the crab burger, with sweet fries. My husband had the southern chicken sandwich with fries. Both dishes not only looked wonderful but were extremely delicious! We sat at the counter. Lorenzo was our server/ bartender. Who was gracious and good at what he does. As he was mixing up a shake (for another order), I asked him about it, he immediately gave me a sample of the amazing banana split shake. The service was quick and great. If you are in the area of downtown Phoenix, give this restaurant a try.  They also offer a build your own burger. Both alcohol and beer are served as well. You may sit out on the patio or inside."}
{"text":"1.5 hours at the restaurant with no burger. After waiting another 30 min after discussing the issue with the manager and still no food. Wtf"}
{"text":"Super cool concept of customizing your own burger. Only place I've been to that has a Hawaiian bun as an option, which I was a big fan of. Employees are very helpful to first timers and suggestions overall. Only complaint is that the fries were a little too salty."}
{"text":"Food and service was good but do not get the build your own burger. It shows the price but geesh like a $20 burger later for something I could get much tastier elsewhere for less. The sweet potato fries were yummy."}
{"text":"They are just incredibly good!! It all comes from using the very best ingredients. I have the bison burger that you will see pictured. It is top prime quality; at least it taste that way. The other build it yourself burgers I've had there have been just amazing, too. That's because everything they put in them is absolutely as fresh as you can imagine, from the garden greens to the jalapeños to the avocados, mushrooms, sprouts, red onions to the meats of various types, it is amazingly fresh and prepared beautifully by their expert kitchen staff. Every time I go in there I have an amazing meal, but the best I've got to say are the build it yourself burgers!! Not to mention the amazing waitstaff, all of whom seem to be long timers and all her fans of the restaurant themselves. Go Meigan!!!"}
{"text":"A year and a half ago I would have given this place five stars. The food is excellent, but their service has been terrible lately. Every time I come in there is no hostess at the podium and I have to wait around ten minutes just to get seated (they will yell at you if you try and seat yourself). Then it takes another ten to fifteen minutes to get a server to come around. They never have enough staff. It's very, very frustrating (particularly if you are on a lunch break). This has happened the last three times I have come in, so three stars it is. Get some more staff and I'll come back more often for your delicious food. P.S. no public wifi for customers? really? I'd like to work on my computer if you're going to make me sit and wait forever."}
{"text":"If you're hopping off the light rail needing a burger this is the place to go. Completely customizable burgers.. think Mongolian grill but for burgers!   The beer selection is great, offering a selection of locally brewed beers. The staff has great energy, the atmosphere is casual downtown dining.  If you're looking for a place you can get a burger, beer, and chill out after a long day, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Bison burger is what I ordered. It tasted FABULOUS. .. BUT MY bill was 22.00... before tip so a lil too expensive... also they were skimpy on the sauce provided on side. & my order was not perfect & for 22.00 it should have been perfect... I was on my lunch break... not the greatest service but okay. Fries should have been more like 1.50 instead of 3.00..... place seemed pretty clean... bathroom soap smelled like plumeria from bath & body works nice attention 2 deal there but darn it the waiter missed adding an egg to my over priced burger!.... ordering was a lil confusing in the sense u write what u want or u verbally choose & they write.. small miscommunication my waiter Steve left off my egg.... lol I still tipped him though. . 4.00 which made my bill 26.00!!!!"}
{"text":"The environment is really nice . The fries are amazing . But way over priced . The staff is very friendly for the most part ."}
{"text":"This was the third time we have been here. The only reason we came back (twice) is because we know one of the managers that used to work here. Plus they had a pretty good groupon deal. All 3 times the food was good but the service was absolutely terrible. Servers seem very unfamiliar with their own menu and all food and drinks took for ever. Our 3rd visit will be our last with one of the worst experiences we've had. Food took forever, they forgot our kids food, and drinks were sub par and took a long time to say the least. We ended up not eating anything and left. This place has a lot of potential but it is poorly run/managed. Thumbs down and will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Tried the new place yesterday. We only have an hour for lunch, we sat for more than an hour and asked to make our order to go! The server was apologetic, it was not her fault! 20 minutes later we finally get our food, waited 10 minutes for someone to figure out our bill, we got up walk to the hostess when our server came to us and said because of our wait there was no charge. Thanks!!!  I ordered the chicken sandwich, it was tasty but NOT worth the wait and Parmesan fries were cold.  To the Managers, if you cannot get folks served and out in an hour, you're doing something wrong!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here, and in both instances the food and the service were outstanding. Amongst myself and my fellow diners, we sampled the   beef, bison, lamb and veggie burgers. I'm impressed by how much effort and care clearly went into the meat and vegetarian options alike. I'd be very surprised if the ahi tuna burger isn't also fantastic. Long story short: I'm glad this place is downtown."}
{"text":"Been waiting for an hour on a Togo order after already waiting 30 minutes to put it in, wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. We waited in line for 30 minutes (used the restroom during our wait and it needed attention, also needed attention when we left), changed our order to a togo in the line + ordered through a \"pen and paper\" check box system with the host, (she also never asked our name, but came up to us asking what the name for our order was after 30 minutes?) The brown haired+ brown eyed hostess also didn't want to tell us that the bar was open seating so we stood for the majority of our wait. First we heard the issue was the servers, then it became the kitchen, but at this point I've concluded that the whole restaurant is really the issue. Sucks I'm late to my concert, and we already had to pay this ridiculous bill so we're trapped here. Not only did I have to go up to 3 servers to get our sodas but I also haven't even gotten our food yet, it's been an hour and a half in total wait time. We surely won't be back anytime soon.. I've worked in the food industry for years, and it's sad to say I was seriously amazed by the lack of management, control, customer service, communication through employees in both the FOH & BOH, and overall respect for the customers.  Edit- We got the food after an hour and a half, my friends salad was wonderful, cooked to perfection at Medium. I happened to order a burger with beef that I also ordered MEDIUM. Since we already had to wait forever and we had a concert (it was 7:30- time we should've been there by) we rushed out and literally \"ate\" the food out of our boxes on the walk to the concert. I say \"ate\" because at first the tomatoes were just sliding off the limp thing (I took them off, no big deal) then after I took a bite and tasted straight cold blood we put a flashlight on it and clearly saw it was 100%  red, wet, uncooked, beef.   I wanted to vomit, couldn't even take a bite more, and I couldn't take it back since you had already made us late for the concert (charged us for it an hour before we got it, we were trapped) So I chose to give the whole burger and some fries to a kind homeless man who was interested in it instead . I ate the sweet potato fries, and I would give you 5 Stars for those but everything else was beyond awful unfortunately it only goes as low as 1 Star on here..."}
{"text":"I have easily eaten here 10 times now.  From the first weeks it opened until now I have had a consistent food experience, a positive food experience.  This is a great place if you like burgers.  This is an even greater place if you like to have your touch on your burgers.  The options for what you can do to a burger will blow your mind.  They are many and interesting and intriguing.    I have each time cast my fate to the whim of my pencil on their order form and it has not failed yet.  Why?  Because the basis of any burger combination I make is their wonderful burger patties.  They absolutely know how to cook a burger.  It comes out consistently juicy and flavorful each and every time.  My only complaint with this spot is its inconsistent service.  In the beginning we chalked up the long wait times and delayed service to just opening and the early crowds.  now, it still is inconsistent at times when there are fewer people.  There must be something in the masterful cooking process that means the kitchen will be slow and inconsistent.  I have decided that the wonderful burger is not yet offset by the slow and irregular service.  Though I have to admit, recently a group of three of us went at 11:20 AM, saw many empty tables and were told we would have to wait 10 minutes because they had just sat a party of 12 on the patio.  Man - week day lunch hours should be your bread and butter and you should be able to handle what comes.  Considering the historically irregular service we had pass and kept walking until another spot around the corner sat us immediately.  From what my peers are saying, dinner crowd is much thinner and service is better than at lunch.  Last hint - I eat my burgers in a bed of greens.  Kind of like a burger salad.  Nice way to avoid the carbs.  It is my go to meal at The Counter."}
{"text":"Food is awesome!!!  The service is horrible. I went there with my family on a Sunday afternoon 040316. Our server Christopher, greeted us by saying are you ready to order and we stated we would like to order drinks. The server replied he would come back when we were ready to order everything including food. He said it would take forever if we only ordered drinks at the time in the valley of the sun. Once we ordered the drinks took forever and my wife's beer was just sitting at the bar. The server appeared to be in such a hurry he forgot to take my wife's order and had to be reminded that she still needed to order her food twice. The appetizer we ordered came out cold because the server didn't bring it out after it just sat in the window. I wanted to just have the appetizer warmed up but the server never came back to ask how it was.  While I was waiting for my food I began to read reviews and noticed the main complaint of the restaurant was how long everything took. I know the restaurant reads these reviews and I put this on the management too.   Once we got our burgers they were excellent. The guacamole was suburb along with everything else. It was just to bad our server Christopher was so horrible and couldn't even get the order right.   The hostess that day was very helpful and did more for us than our server."}
{"text":"Every burger that we tried from the \"Expert Build\" menu was pretty awesome.  The \"Bison w/Bite\" and the Lamburger both made it clear that the chef knows how to pair the perfect sauce with a great cheese.  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see they had a vegan patty available at regular price, seeing as the impossible burger has a $5.50 upcharge. But overall, the \"burger\" was good and I was happy with the meal"}
{"text":"Friendly servers that are knowledgeable about the menu. Fresh ingredients with a ton of options to build your own burger or pick from the delicious combos they already have built. Generous portions, reasonable prices and the sweet potatoes fries were perfectly crispy with just enough of the natural flavor. I had the WTF turkey burger soooo unique and delicious. Would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Arrived solo at 11 on a Monday. There were four tables filled. I built a 1/3 pound burger and added bacon, a sauce flight, fries and an iced tea for $18.73 plus tip.   The lunch still took 12 mins to arrive. The burger was cooked perfectly, the bun was fresh, the shoestring fries were nice and crispy, the sauces were very tasty and the toppings on the burger were abundant.   I just wish a simple lunch, when the place was nearly empty, didn't take 40 mins start to finish."}
{"text":"I was so excited to check out the Counter since it is right down the street from where I live.  The staff was very welcoming when I arrived and I found a seat at the bar.  Both bartenders were exceptionally nice too.  I ordered a custom turkey burger with fries.  The fries were great, but the turkey burger was dry and got lost on the big pretzel bun.  I am hoping I just ordered the wrong thing and it isn't a sign of the entire quality of the menu."}
{"text":"Best Bison Burger anywhere, delicious sauces, great sides, I like the onion strips. I would eat hear more, but what i order isn't cheap. Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Okay so I used to go to The Counter in Cali, and liked their food then too. The food is good, well cooked custom burgers and salads and average prices drinks. If 'adult milkshakes' are your thing, they have some cool boozey dessert shakes too.  The problem is how understaffed this place is, especially when you have a groupon to bring in more business. The hostess was really friendly, but when we arrived she told us there was a 10 minute wait. Mind you, the restaurant was empty and there were maybe 5 seated tables outside- on a Friday night at 6:15. Once we were seated, our server took quite a long time to take our order, bring us our drinks, and when he did being our order- no utensils until we asked another waiter 10 minutes later. I really want to like this place because the food is good, the location is prime and the staff were all friendly- they just had too little of staff so they couldn't give attentive service.  I hope they step it up. I am routing for the place to do better, but there is no way to do that is you don't have any bussers, enough servers and more than one bartender on a Friday night."}
{"text":"The GM called me to apologize and invite us back. We appreciate and accept their invitation to make things right. It takes a lot to take responsibility and earn customers' trust. Thank you, Counter!"}
{"text":"I've visited The Counter twice, and won't again.  My first visit I dropped $15 on a burger and fries... plus a tip.  The burger was OK, but there are definitely better burgers in Downtown Phoenix (i.e. 1130 in the AZ Center).  On my second visit I took my daughter for a celebratory milkshake after her music audition.  The shakes were just OK, and pricey.  What's worse, when I looked at my bank statement, the charge was different than I remember approving - with a $6 tip on a $15 purchase!  I like to think I'm a generous tipper, but this was certainly fraud.  I called to resolve the issue, and was asked to come in and talk to a manager.  When I came in one slow afternoon (total of 5 people were eating at the time), I waited to speak with a manager for over 15 minutes - the whole time with a server letting me know every few minutes that the manager would \"be with me in a minute\".  I finally left my business card with a note to call or email me.  I'm not surprised I haven't heard back.  I won't be going back to The Counter anytime soon but not solely because of this bad experience.  Instead of eating overpriced yet mediocre burger and shakes at The Counter, walk across the street to 5 Guys in CityScape or Coney Island on Monroe to save a few bucks for a better burger."}
{"text":"Resturants these days have moved to wood or metal seats- not good for my scrawny ass. Build-A-Burger is following this (unfortunate for me) trend. Started out with a Grand Canyon Amber. Excellent beir! Had to sit at the counter, clean, baseball on both wide screen tvs. My beer glass has a small chip. I will tell them. Basically you fill out a form with checks in boxes to have your sandwich custom made. A lot of good options here: beef, chicken, bison, turkey burger (I think) even a veggie option. Multiple cheese offerings, multiple veggie toppings available. A handful of sides and several bun choices. You can even get your burger in a bowl- bun free. I got 1/3 lb beef on multi grain bun, mixed greens, grilled onions, grilled tomatoes, no cheese. My side is homemade chili. We shall see---"}
{"text":"Omg, STAY AWAY. 30 minutes at our table and we were never served. Not even a glass of water. We walk out and call to complain about the bad service and to request a parking refund, as we paid to park for no reason now, but all Odie the manager did was defended our waitress and refused to do anything for us. All I wanted was parking reimbursement. Then when I asked for her bosses name and times of availability, she got very snoty and told me to call tomorrow as managers don't have set schedules. I can't imagine you will last another 3 months. I'm sharing on FB, IG, Snapchat, already tweeted it. I'm ok with mistakes, I'm not ok with rude managerial staff. Odie  and Corvette need a lot more training."}
{"text":"This is our third visit to The Counter.  Everything was perfect this time because of the efforts of Rachel Malkewitz, assistant manager.  Our first couple of times here, our burgers were overlooked at first and she always took care of things.   This trip, we told her we were here and she made sure the burgers were cooked right the first time!   Thank you, Rachel and kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"My problem is not with the food. However, we had to wait 10-15 minutes for a server to take our order. When the food came at least two of the ingredients I chose for my hamburger were missing. But my biggest complaint is that although we ordered and paid for two half-pounders, we were served two one-third pound hamburgers. We didn't notice until we were almost finished so it would have been difficult to show our server that a mistake had been made. Still the food was good so we may return."}
{"text":"Just stopped back here and had the Ahi Tuna burger that was fantastic!  By far the best tuna burger I've ever had.   Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Food took longer than expected due to a convention in town. But other then that the staff is super friendly great food and even greater shakes. The bison burger was great and I had a custom grey goose shake it was amazingly good!"}
{"text":"The Counter is a cool burger spot in the heart of downtown Phx. It's a awesome concept how they let you customize your burger. The Hawaiian bun is a must, my girlfriend got it and I instantly regretted my choice lol The environment is casual and cozy. The service could have been better but the staff was friendly all around. It isn't the best burger I've had but they definitely did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Waited 35 minutes for a well done burger that I ordered medium, waited 20 minutes before asking and being told I had to wait for the other orders before they made mine. I left on the spot never coming back again"}
{"text":"My friends and I chose burgers for lunch and gave this place a try. I chose to build my own burger and chose the counter relish as my dressing. Which I think is just ketchup with relish in it. So a little disappointed cause ketchup is already on the table. Should've went with mustard. We shared sides of fried pickles and shoestring onions. The fried pickles were good but I've had better and we didn't care for the apricot sauce that came with them. Shoestring onions were pretty tasty too and kind of delicate but they were good and came with a side of ranch and BBQ sauce for dipping. The burger was delicious!   Here's why I can't give this place a higher rating. There were 3 of us and we were sharing the sides and the sauces that came with them were in little cups. So we asked to get a couple more sides of ranch to dip our sides in so we'd each have our own and could double dip in our own sauce if we wanted and because we did not like the apricot sauce and didn't want the BBQ sauce. The server had no problem bringing the sauces but what she failed to tell us is there's a cost for each extra side of sauce and we only asked for ranch and she brought us BBQ sauce too. So we had 4 extra sides I sauce but only needed 2. We didn't know there was an extra cost until we got the bill. It's ok if it costs extra for sides of sauce but we should've been advised first. I ended up using one of the BBQ sauces on my burger cause I didn't care for the counter relish. Not a horrible experience but could've been better. Burgers are good though."}
{"text":"I should preface this review by stating that this is purely based on customer service not the the food. The food at The Counter is EXCELLENT, which, is the only reason I keep giving it the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately after another bad experience I finally decided to write a review. Myself and some of my coworkers have been to The Counter a hand full of times since they've opened because of the delicious food. We have experienced long waits, missing food, over charges, under charges, and poor managerial intervention. As I mentioned before, today was the straw that broke the camels back, as they say. Due to our past experiences we decided to call ahead and place our order in an attempt to alleviate the long waits and confusion at the bar. We were told it would be ready in 10-15 mins. We waited 15 mins before we left the office, then walked the 5 mins it takes to get to the restaurant, and low and behold our food was still not ready. The dining room was not crowded and there we only a couple people at the bar so the hostess said it'd be right up. Another 15 mins later the food was still not out so the hostess checked and said it was being packed up. While we were waiting, a customer came up to the bar with their to go order that was wrong and they somehow were able to cook her a new order and send her on her way, all while our food was being \"packed up\". When our order finally came out we decided to check it. There weren't  any sauces for the burgers, a side of fries was missing, one sandwich was missing bacon, and one had extra toppings that were not ordered. We crossed checked the receipts and all were exactly what we ordered but not sure where the confusion came (It should also be noted that we all ordered different burgers). Once the staff fixed everything and we got back to our office, we finally the tasted the food, which was great, but this time that won't be enough to keep us coming back for more..."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place....so I decided to try it right before the Phoenix Mercury opener. Well...if you sit up at the bar service is fast.....so tgey gwt a 1/2 star....the restroom is clean so they get 1/2 star. Food was served quickly.....1/2 star. You get to make your own burger....how you want it...so 1/2 star. Total 2 stars. Food is over priced....and it's cold when you get it......and I had to ask for extra lettuce-sprouts because there were hardly any on the turkey burger I ordered. I was lucky enough to get the happy hour $4.00 pints of Grand Canyon beer......so I would give another star for that. I should have gone someplace else but you never know till you try...."}
{"text":"Creating your own customized burger is part of the appeal here.  They do it well and with good presentation. The server Dwayne was very helpful and attentive! One of us ordered the breaded chicken which was a bit of a miss, the taste and moisture was there but the breading was sliding off and falling apart. Enjoyed a nice selection of sauces to go along with our sandwiches, and its nice having a bar available for adult beverages."}
{"text":"How do I begin?  It was terrible!  The wait was rediculuous and there were only 6 people in restaurant at 8:30 pm.  I got 1/2 lb. bison burger ($12.99) and it was the size of a McDonald's cheeseburger.  The wife got a grilled ham and cheese and it tasted like s#!t.  The bison burger was over cooked (I ordered medium) and as hard as a hockey puck with no taste.  Safe your money, time and avoid this place at all cost."}
{"text":"I hope the \"owners\" of this place read my review.  Understand that I don't bad mouth places unless it's legitimate.  And my intent is to get these places to know how they are operating, so they can improve.  Tried this place because of a Groupon.  Walked in and there were \"maybe\" 20 to 25 customers.  Waited 15 minutes before drink order was taken.  Then another 15 minutes before order was taken.  And each time it was because I had to ask somebody to attend to us.  Another 20 minutes before food was brought and then never saw another server until I had to again ask for someone to bring me the check.  The thin, blonde hostess had about as much personality as a box of wet tissues.  Whatever happened to a smile, a greeting?  Something that shows me that as a customer, my patronage is appreciated.  She should not be the hostess.    The food...  The fries were delicious.  Great raspberry tea.   Waiting and hour for meh burgers.  Not worth it.  Better hamburgers can be found at 5 guys or even In-N-Out.   I don't recommend this place to anyone.  $38 dollars for two burgers, fries and iced tea.  I say use your money somewhere else, unless they actually plan on changing things up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time last night, and were really excited because we love burgers and thought this looked like a great place. When we got there, the host inside saw us coming and opened the door for us, promptly guiding us to an empty table.  From there, our waiter was really friendly, and showed us all the deals they were offering, as well as how their menu worked for building your own burger. We thought this was a great option because my boyfriend is picky and always prefers it when he can build his own :)  Unfortunately, I have to give this place two stars, as that was the extent of our good experience. Once we ordered, our food took an extremely long time to be cooked and brought out to our table. We were meeting friends right after dinner, so I was paying close attention to the time. I would have been more understanding had it been really busy, but the restaurant was really only half full.   What was extremely disappointing was the fact that when our burgers finally came out, they were cold! I can handle food that's warm rather than hot, but these weren't even warm anymore, so we couldn't help but feel like they had been sitting in the kitchen for a long time before being brought out. We didn't bother to say anything because we were late for our plans and didn't have time to wait for the food to be reheated or remade, but I wasn't very happy about it.   Otherwise, I could tell the burgers probably would have been really good, so I would want to try it again. I do think it's a bit expensive here, but had the burgers been served hot, it may have been worth it :)"}
{"text":"Well I would have reviewed their fold but we never actually got it. There were a group of 8 of us. We put in our order for drinks and food and an hour later got no food. Our waiter never came back. After sitting there someone else came and asked us for our drink order again.....after we had already been sitting for an hour. We then ask for the manager and ask her what was going on with our order. She went to go find out and told us that our order had been put in 5 minutes ago. Again we had been sitting waiting for an hour. The manager apologized was quite non challant about how long it took our food and we decided to leave. I will never eat here EVER!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Considering this place specializes in burgers and that they charge so much for their food, it was very mediocre.  The server was very nice, but it took forever for them to bring our drinks, order our food, and receive our food. Our group ordered 4 burgers total and everyone agreed theirs were bland.  I also ordered fried pickles as a topping for my burger, and they charged us $1.25 for 4 little fried pickle slices.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place needs to work on it's service.  We walked in at a little after 1:00 and were half heartedly greeted by a slovenly host and shown to a sticky table.  From there we sat for several minutes before being informed by our waitress that there was little chance of being served in time to leave by 2:00 because \"they were still catching up from lunch\".  So we got up and left.  Can't imagine any serious professional scheduling a business lunch here."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat here. Two of us on a waiting list. No problem. Then a group of three walk in. Told they could sit at the bar. No problem there either. They instead chose a table that had opened up across from the bar. We pointed this out to the hostess who went over and said something to them. They obviously were not asked to move. So, we went over to say something to the group. They acted surprised that they had walked past a several people on the wait list to take the table. Needless to say we walked out. The situation was not handled well. Decided to give our business to a more deserving establishment."}
{"text":"Should have heeded the long wait warnings. Would love to try this place out again but lunch in under an hour isn't an unreasonable standard. Place was maybe 60% filled and between 3 to 4 host and wait staff we gave up after waiting at our table for 30min before someone asked what happened to our food.   Unfortunately we weren't the only ones. Saw a few people speak to the manager so I assume it was a good day.   Lunch goers should avoid if time is important. The food did smell good but at those prices of hope for less than 45min dining experience."}
{"text":"Took our adult son there after the Dback game. Disappointing! Wait staff  not attentive, burgers overdone. Wondering where the manager was. Predicting this over priced cool place won't last long with poor management. Too bad, food has potential, but ya gotta get it out there in timely manner."}
{"text":"Second visit ...waitress was very nice. Wait time for food was long even tho restaurant was mostly empty. Burgers were over cooked ..would have sent them back but we were on a time crunch. Was \"much\" better last time we were there ..disappointed."}
{"text":"Always a great burger place to come to while in town. The kids love the build your own concept. Fresh and fun."}
{"text":"The Counter has a pretty awesome menu and build you own burger has so many options that you will need to come back to try more. The shakes are delicious and you can taste the quality ice cream they claim to use!   Great place for lunch or dinner. The only negative is this is located right at the light rail platform which causes quite the rumble and shakes the whole restaurant. If the rumble every 7 to 12 minutes doesn't bother you, try this place!!"}
{"text":"We walked there because it was close to our hotel. Boy, were we glad we went!  We ate from the happy hour menu and tried their fries pickles which were excellent, the fried onions were crazy good and the mini burgers were fantastic!  The beer was also ice cold and oh so good with the food.  Their service was great, the atmosphere was fun and the food was the best we've had in a long time. The only downside is that we don't live in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I'm rarely in the mood for a burger these days, especially since they all seem the same. I mean, how creative can a burger get anymore?  I didn't try any of their specialty burgers - I decided to build my own. I know that's not new or anything, but when you have things like sun dried tomatoes, pesto, grated Parmesan.. You can make one helluva burger.  The service was great, the beef was cooked extremely well and the view of the city and light rail made for very interesting people watching through their large double pane Windows.  Only downside imo is location. Parking is a bit tough, but don't let that deter you. Check it out and tell them Chris sent you.  Ok, don't tell them that. They probably have no idea who I am."}
{"text":"FYI just went by tonight and it's closed till further notice for maintenance issues!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on Thursday, great downtown location with windows all around.  Sat at the bar and Nick the bartender/server saw that I was eying the menu and offered some assistance. It is a build your own sandwich kind of place. Choose burger or chicken, size,  bread/roll, toppings, sides, etc. I choose the chicken, 1/3 lb with a couple toppings, and a soda, simple that is all I wanted. About 5 minutes later my lunch arrived, looked pretty good and it was a good chicken sandwich. The total bill was $15 for a chicken sandwich and a soda, a bit over priced for possibly the simplest item on the menu, had I ordered a larger size and a side dish, I would have been in the $20+ range. The venue is very nice and the server, Nick was helpful, friendly and there when I needed a refill on soda. All in all, just an OK as the dollars spent were a bit high for the items eaten."}
{"text":"Two coworkers and I went to the Counter for lunch yesterday.  The entire experience was terrible.  When we arrived, the hostess told us it would be about a five minute wait for a table, despite there being at least 6 empty tables that would have fit our party.  We waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  After we were seated, we sat at the table for at least ten to fifteen minutes without anyone coming over to our table to take our drink or lunch order.  So, we decided to just go to the bar and order the food as takeout.  While waiting for our takeout order, the hostess attempted to toss trash into the bar trash can (approximately 10 feet away) and missed the can but hit a customer.  After about 15 minutes of additional waiting, we received out takeout.  We ordered two Hippie Salads and added grilled chicken breast to them.  Those salads were $14 each (because grilled chicken breast adds $4 to the price).  We also ordered a Caesar Salad which was $8.50.    Upon returning to the office the discovered the Hippie Salads were fine, even if a bit overpriced.   The Caesar Salad, however, was ridiculous.  It consisted of THREE leafs of lettuce, a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese, and a few croutons for $8.50!!  I will never return to the Counter.  The service is terrible and the food is overpriced."}
{"text":"Location is nice. Only a 5 blocks walk from the Sheraton. However if you near the trolly line. It has a stop on their door steps which is a huge plus for tourist like my self. This Restaurant seems very hip and trendy. Both the waitress and the host that helped me to be seated and take my order are super friendly and helpful. With the recommendation of my waitress. She gave me three suggestions of her favorite burgers. I narrowed it to two of them and let her decide for me. She chose the breakfast burger. As for sides she recommended the onion strings or the tots and again I let her decide. So tots it is. After questioning how fresh the beef is. I decided again on her recommendation to go with rare as she assured me it's super high quality and always fresh.   They have a full bar and two good size tv's displaying two different channel's. I was alittle sadden to hear they only have 2 local beers on draft. The first suggestion was the moon juice as it is local and very populer. So I'm giving them a shot as well. Options are 16 or 20oz. For me the moon juice is a little too citrus but it's drinkable.   Upon arriving I was immediately seated and offered the DIY selection to make the burger of my dreams. Trust me. The list is huge for selections if you want to make a crazy Kitchen Sink Burger. Then I'd suggest you take that list and build your own mountain. For me I want to go with a staple on the menu. But to each their own.   As for the presentation. The plate was not cleaned by the expiditer so it has random food marks on the top and bottom of the plate. A simple wipe down. Would have stepped up the presentation.  The tots are fried a little hard and are defiantly not much different that store bought. (Update the waitress could tell they were not right and took them off the bill without me asking. Which I did eat about 5 of them so I would have paid for them bit I'm changing my review based on this small gesture of great service.)  So here is the down and dirty. What this place lacks in presentation it makes up for in burger flavor. In short. I'm giving 4 stars based on everything over all. But truth is the service and what I came for... the BURGER.... are both 5 stars. I would suggest this place to anyone who is a burger fan and though I'm only here for a few days. I just may come back.  Update (I'm gonna go ahead and say 5 stars as the service and burger flavor are both 5. The presentation was a little disappointing as were the tots. However. I came here for a burger and got what I wanted plus great service. So 4.7 stars is my review. Round up to 5. Yes I would suggest if your a burger lover you should come here and try what they offer.   Good luck and good eats."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good decor, great food and happy hour specials. My Korean BBQ burger and my fiance's $5 specials 2 mini crab cake burger were bomb. Small collection of tap beer and some wines. All in all I loved this place. This is a must try for everyone who visit Downtown Phoenix. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"BEWARE....WAY OVER PRICED! Wow... Where do I start? First and last time to eat here. I walked in and read the menu, I noticed a chalk board that reads... \"HAPPY HOUR 3pm -6pm\" Build Your Own Burger or Create Your Own Shake, so I thought I'd try it. My server came over and asked if I was ready to order. I replied \" I'm going to order the \"Happy Hour\" Build Your Own Burger and Build Your Own Shake, his reply was... Those shouldn't even be on the board because we don't have those included on the Happy Hour Specials. Then why are they advertised? Very misleading! How much should one pay for a simple Bacon Cheeseburger, Cheddar French Fries and a Milk Shake for ONE PERSON? How about $28.92 The prices are absolutely ridiculous, I have never been overcharged by so much in my entire 27 year career of eating hamburgers. With the tip, my bill came to $32.00 I could've eaten in a fancy restaurant and still paid much less. The pricing is simply highway robbery! Beware before you go, if you're a party of four people, expect to pay around $120.00 Come on people, it's burgers and fries it's not fillet mignon steak & lobster, get your pricing together.  I should've went to eat all you can eat sushi for $20 and I've had a much better meal. I really hope to see restaurants like this fail because of how they gouge the public. Also, you misled people to believe its discounted for your so called HAPPY HOUR! And did I mention how bad the service was? Good Luck... Change your name to The Cash Register   See BYOB & BYOS HAPPY HOUR PHOTO BELOW.... Very Misleading!"}
{"text":"The Counter is always a great place to go for a burger.  Love the ability to customize your burger using the checkbox form.    This time around I tried 'The Impossible Burger'.  A meatless burger made of plants, but tastes and bleeds like a real meat burger.  All Counter locations now offer them.  There's been a lot of hype around this burger, and after trying it, was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  If I didn't know what the burger was, I would not have guessed it wasn't a beef burger.  If anything, I may have thought the burger was made of a very lean beef, as it can fall apart a bit, which I have experienced with regular beef burgers in the past.    But otherwise, it was a great burger.  One thing interesting about this burger, during cooking it creates a bit of a crust around the burger, which tastes awesome!  The Counter may want to take advantage of this crust for other recipes or offerings.  In any case, if you've never been to The Counter, or if it's been a while... now's a great time to go back and try out the new Impossible Burger!"}
{"text":"We discovered this very cool place when we were looking for the Impossible Burger, a plant based burger that looks and tastes exactly like a real burger. It is truly amazing and The counter is one of a few eateries to carry it. We travel from Anthem to eat this every week. Our first two visits were excellent. The food was as promised, service was attentive and nice, great to feel servers care about your happiness and inject their warm personalities into the experience, the tip always reflect the service, so 25-30% for caring, timely friendly service is easily justified. This past Saturday my wife and I made our weekly 35 minute drive and this day we were so disappointed. Apathetic server, no manage- ment, poor service, cold food and when the burger showed up, one was missing sweet potato fries, not good, server didn't bother to get them until the meals end and who wants to eat fries after their meal. Where is the care and compassion we witnessed on our first 2 visits, server was not into it and  we tipped accordingl, further fries should not have been charged, no drink refills and with a tab for 2 burgers, lemonade and fries at over $50, this cannot happen again. I just wonder who is going to respond to this review to  determine whether we ever return. Remember guests are coming all the way to your location, parking, entering, spending and adding to your lives, you need to appreciate this and do more to make us want to return to you."}
{"text":"When we arrived there were like two other customers. It did fill up rather quickly but the service was painfully slow. When the food finally came out was plain and boring, my husbands tater tots looked like they had been under a great lamp forever. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Just had great food, great beer and excellent service from Nathan. The milk shakes were delicious and well priced at $4. We enjoyed a burger salad and recommend the bison burger. Also had the split fries and onion straws, also good."}
{"text":"Walk into The Counter in downtown Phoenix, and you'll immediately feel welcomed. The restaurant has an upscale diner feel, with a sports television-filled bar, comfy booths and lots of tables for both one-on-one encounters and family outings. I loved the lighting, which was just right at not-too-bright, not-too-dim, and despite the construction currently surrounding the restaurant's streets, it's nice to have a downtown Phoenix view while you nosh.  My pal and I recently dined there and tried a ton of menu items, a great variety for both fans of the build-your-own-burger concept, as well as vegans and vegetarians. We started with fried dill pickle chips ($5), which came with a sweet apricot sauce. I liked the sweet and salty combination, and the pickles were fried to a great consistency, light and not greasy.  We also split a big caprese salad ($7.50), which came with marinated red and green tomatoes, red onion and thick slices of mozzarella. These two items alone would have filled us both up. I loved the green tomatoes, which is a unique touch to the tomatoes you usually get in a caprese salad.  The build your own burger process is the really fun part. Grab a sheet of paper outlining all your burger options, and fill it out, sushi-style. There's a housemade vegan option, as well as bison, turkey, chicken and tuna burgers. Get it with a bun (options include a vegan ciabatta and pretzel bun), or go bowl-style and forgo carbs. There are a dozen cheeses to choose from, 26 sauces to add, and nearly 50 toppings to pile on, including dried cranberries, quinoa and marinated artichokes. Premium toppings include an egg, bacon and chili. Add a side for $3, from shoestring or sweet potato fries, to seasonal grilled corn, and you've got a very filling meal - I couldn't finish a quarter of my burger and crispy onion strings combo after the appetizers.  For my burger, I ordered the vegan patty on a vegan ciabatta bun, with herbed goat cheese spread, house mustard, a lettuce blend, alfalfa sprouts, tomatoes, red onion and dill pickles. Although I added a ton to my burger, everything was portioned well-enough so I could hold it without a problem and cut it in half cleanly. The vegan patty was delicious, and I'd highly recommend my flavor combination if you're looking for a great veggie option. If you're vegan, there is also a vegan cheddar, which really made me appreciate how well The Counter is mindful of all its customers.  You can also build your own salad, or order a burger on their menu in a combination the restaurant has concocted. Besides a full bar, one of the other cool aspects to The Counter is that you can order an adult shake, a sweet treat with your choice of spirit or liqueur. Besides the tasty food and welcoming ambiance, my pal and I thought our service was stellar, especially considering all the things we ordered. We received everything promptly and were checked on diligently, which we were really thankful for."}
{"text":"I ate here Sunday evening just before close with a friend. The food was good but service sucked horribly.   I ordered a custom burger with side of chili as did my buddy although his was off the menu. It took nearly 45 minutes for our server to return to the table only to advise that my order had been missed/ mixed up but was being expedited and available shortly.   Being I also ordered a bowl of chili also , I didn't get too crazy but asked that my chili be brought out immediately. My buddy had already been brought his chili ( with no utensils/spoon ). Again I waited probably another 15 minutes before I flagged down a second server and asked that my chili be sent out. It was probably another 10 minutes before that occurred.   My buddy ate his (cold) chili as well as his burger before I even received my chili. We were both bewildered why, with no more than three tables, it took such an extended period to obtain food. It's typical once a mistake is made for a server to do what it takes to recover and expedite the meal.   I'm not prone to exaggeration but I've received better service at a McDonalds.   On a good note, the food was quite good so ok inclined to go in again but I hope this feedback encourages service changes. Everyone was friendly, the food was good but serious focus should be made on service or I doubt your business will last."}
{"text":"I went here specifically for the impossible burger, which was amazing. Seriously, unreal, my mind was blown. However, the burger with a side of fries was $20 with no special toppings, extra sauce, or anything. My husband got a regular burger which he claimed was good but not great, for $11. Burgers do not come with sides so said and done with tip and no drinks aside from water, for 2 burgers and one side of fries it was close to $40. Restaurant is super cute, food is delicious (in my opinion anyway) but the price point is just so crazy it's hard to justify."}
{"text":"First time in Phoenix Arizona and I decided to take a walk about downtown.  The vibe is hipster and business, makes sense with the presence of ASU & major executive buildings, city hall and the convention center all centralized, you can tell who comes where from the way they appear.  I was coming in from Mesa and wanted to do a little sight seeing.   As I stepped off the LightRail subway, immediately you can feel the beefy of the people, like a tiny dose of Chicago or New York - lets throw in Los Angeles in the mix too.  student bristling past me along with office people from different work backgrounds and all I could do in my laid back Hawaiian style swagger was watch it all and soak it in.  I could smell all the wonderful eateries wafting in the air as I took pics of all the wonderful architecture of tall statuesque building with wonderful details to add to their monumental stature.  I just happen to walk by The Counter, the aroma emitted from this corner eatery was very inviting. I'm a very meat eating carnivore that loves steaks and burgers!  Automatically after walking around, I was very much into trying out this gem!  I walked in and Mick, the bartender immediately greeted me, just as he continued to do so with every other customer after me.  He was quick to ask me if I wanted a drink - PBR BABY! Yes, I'm a little ghetto - and it was served in a can which I prefer!  I was half distracted to do some social media when Mick showed me how to create my own burger. So, many choices but all sounded delicious.  I placed my order and not even 15 minutes, my order was brought out, fresh and hot. The only thing was the chef forgot my sun dried tomatoes. That is forgivable.   After my first bite, it truly didn't need it, my eyes were bigger than my palette in this situation.  Mick offered some small talk, I applaud is genuine interest in his guests and actually gave me some great insight on where else I could go to enjoy some good music while I'm here.  The food is affordable, it's also a fairly new place open around a year now.  I would recommend anyone to come and visit, the burgers are cooked to your liking (side note: I love my burger rare - and it was cooked perfectly! Seared and flavorful with the creaminess of avocado, pickles, and a roasted garlic aoli!  My side was expertly crispy fried sweet potato fries which I could not finish because my burger was gargantuan!  If in Phoenix, check it out and at least have lunch and cocktails there!  Welcome to Phoenix, AZ!  :)"}
{"text":"Second time visiting The Counter.  The atmosphere is great, you feel like you're in a real downtown diner with a great downtown vibe.  As for the food, it's pretty good.  We ordered the fires which had great texture and the sliders, after the waiter gave us a great recommendation on how to have the burgers prepared.  We also got a couple of their handcrafted shakes.  I wasn't overly impressed with the shakes, but I think I'm more of a Frosty fan anyway.  They did have a good selection of shakes to try from and a build your own option.  Tip though, order the small shake, it's a good size and not that much smaller than the large.  The only real downside to this place is the price.  I wish you'd get a little more for what you pay for.  All in all though, the food is good and the atmosphere is pretty unique for being in the center of Phx."}
{"text":"Ummmm...two words for you here the IMPOSSIBLE BURGER. Try it...you won't regret it...ENOUGH SAID!!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the rating fool you, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the burgers.   The three stars are for service, fries and presentation. Our waitress, Casey, was awesome. She was fun and attentive, but knew exactly when to back off and let us \"enjoy\" our food. Fantastic service.   Shoestring fries are my favorite. These were crisp and light and wonderful. I offered some to my date but I was very relieved when she declined.   The Counter is a cool trendy place. Kind of like an updated diner sort of feel.   THE BURGER WAS COLD.   Every component was cold. If you're offering a completely customized burger but can't handle putting all the components on in a timely fashion, why offer it? The patty was cold, the grilled peppers and tomatoes were cold, the lettuce was cold, the draft beer was cold, my seat was slightly cold. SO COLD.   And that will be the only time I complain about something being too cold in the summertime in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Been going to this place weekly with co-workers.  Initially, we were all very impressed with the food, atmosphere, and the friendly service.  We wanted to try EVERYTHING.  To our dismay over the past couple of weeks, the food is mediocre and the service has declined considerably.  Not sure what's going on with this place, we figured maybe the quality control person quit.  Today's experience was the worst.  Our waiter mostly ignored us and our 'create your own' wishes.  He did not tell us the Loaded Spuds which we love would come without bacon, as they were out of it...loaded spuds NOT good without the bacon.  On that note, the manager decided to comp the spuds...good call, we might give you one last chance.  They used to split the burger for us when we share, today we had to cut our own burger in half.  One person missing their 'custom' sauce order and another missing their 'custom' grilled onions, took 5 minutes for the waiter to come back to the area where we had to stand and yell to get his attention...waving our arms around in spasm did not work.  Another guest missing the chicken she ordered with the Caesar salad. All problems were quickly remedied, but it felt like the server hated us by now.  What is going on Counter burger?  You won't last six months in the downtown area, if you don't fix these quality issues.  We've seen it before in the downtown area.  Your prices dictate the quality that should be given, if you plan to stay in business very long.  There are just too many choices around here."}
{"text":"Cheater!  They try to overcharge all of the bills in our party.  Luckily I keep my receipt!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Counter Custom Built Burgers tonight and used a Groupon that I purchased last month. Parking is metered and we ended up parking around the corner. Once seated we checked off the boxes on the ordering sheet to build our desired burgers with all of the scrumptious options, then waited for our server. Once he took our order we were served with 10 minutes. We both made up vegan burgers and they were delicious. We live in North Phoenix and don't dine downtown often so this was a nice change of pace and I could see a return visit in the near future."}
{"text":"I can't believe all of the negative reviews on this place. THEY'VE BEEN OPEN A WEEK, PEOPLE! CHILL!  Yes, there is a bit of a wait. Give these guys some time and I'm sure they'll run a tighter ship before long. I have been here twice and have been happy both times. The people that work here are all very friend and nice. I take onboard that it's pricey, but for $16 I got a 1/3 patty cooked medium rare, the way I like it, with cheddar, bleu cheese, bacon, spinach, grilled onions and sautéed mushrooms with a side of onion strings. The patty was SOLID: fresh and cooked to perfection; all of the extras were of high quality and the onion strings were DELICIOUS.   I thought that they give you plenty of food. Yes, you pay more, but we're talking high quality ingredients, not pre-cooked McDonald's. I can't afford to do this every day but I deserve something like this once or twice a month. I'm really eager to try their milkshakes....and then there's the bar. Again, don't let the negative reviews deter you, this is right up my alley. If you're short on time, give them a few weeks to settle in or go later in the day, not during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"Came across this place while we were downtown, my boyfriend loves burger places and wanted to check it out, so we did. We both ordered the Bacon BBQ burger, chili cheese fries, a side order of regular and sweet potato fries as well. Our burgers came out before of chili cheese fries which was fine, but with the amount of fries in that bowl, we definitely expected MORE toppings, so that was a fail. Our burgers were too over cooked eventhough we asked for medium rare but I guess burger places just can't make it medium rare anymore, only thing I really loved about the burger was the BBQ sauce, which was on the side, oddly and the onion rings in it. Our side order of fries actually tasted better than the chili cheese one, guess you can't really go wrong with just fries though.  Ultimately we weren't big fans of this place, definitely over priced for what we got."}
{"text":"Good service good bison burger! The only place I know that has adult milkshakes that are good as well! Clean atmosphere and you feel the vibration of the train when it passed. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"my two friends and i liked the interior from the outside and signs so we decided to walk in, we were greeted by friendly staffs and the service was great but the food itself wasn't so satisfying. we ordered three burgers and two sides of sweet potato fries. meats were way overcooked (we weren't asked how we would like our meats), blue cheese on my burger wasn't hot, buns were hard so we didn't eat the buns. and sweet potato fries were not very crispy. none of us finished the dishes because they weren't tasty. i liked the idea of customizing our own burger though."}
{"text":"I used to go here in California and have never had as bad of an experience as I did last night. We were about 5 minutes away but called first to check the wait (it was a Saturday night). The lady who answered the phone said the wait was about 15 minutes for 2 but we could put our name on the waitlist over the phone. We showed up and told the hostess our name and of course it wasn't on the list (first bad impression), so we had to wait even longer because we had to now go to the bottom of the list. What made the wait much worse is that all these people were waiting at least 30 minutes outside while half the tables in the restaurant were empty. Some had sat unbussed for the entire time we waited. Being a waitress myself, I would've been more understanding if they were really busy, but they definitely were not. We finally sat down and immediately wanted to leave because of how freezing it was in there. I asked out waiter if they could make it warmer and he said that they \"normally can't\" but he'll ask... Needless to say we sat their shivering the whole time. We ordered two beers, and didn't see those for at least 10-15 minutes later. Our waiter wasn't very attentive. Was forgetful of things we asked for. Our burgers were unfortunately overcooked but the food was decent, overall. The thing that made the experience even worse was the manager. Any manager I have ever worked for has always been concerned with checking on tables and making sure their guests are happy especially on nights when things are clearly going wrong. She stood at the front on her phone and didn't talk to one table. The table across from us took it upon themselves to go to the bar and get their wine, go get the correct dressing for their food, and get their bill paid. Very disappointed in our experience and won't be going back, which is unfortunate because I really like this chain."}
{"text":"Took my girl here cause we walked past it last time she was in town. She didn't like that we had to walk around the back to get in but other than that it was great. Margaritas had some kick and that Blue Burger was soooooo good! Thumbs way up!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not sure why it's gotten some negative reviews????!  This is an established concept hailing from Northern Cali.   Best burgers in Phoenix!!! Great service and great concept. Build your burger with a zillion choices...onion strings are the best as are the deep fried pickle chips!  Ate here today and it was stellar!   Such a great location!!!   Amazing burger with the Cabernet Dijon!"}
{"text":"First Yelp Review is this new location that opened today 6/8/2015 in Downtown Phoenix by my office.    I have worked in the Food & Beverage Industry in Quick Service, Casual Dining & Fine Dining in Orlando, FL at numerous locations in Walt Disney World.  My Problem with this place is the Owners & Management! You should've had a real Soft Opening as opposed to likely inviting certain people to come in! You have an establishment in the middle of downtown Phoenix with many office buildings that will come to your site for lunch (limited time to eat)- you clearly did not factor this in while planning!  You could have the servers trained on the menu and how to be courteous to guests when they come in, but you should have seen how they AND THE KITCHEN would react when they get busy!  So now you have an opening of your franchise and people saw they can't waste their time at the location!  I walked by this location last week and saw various people inside eating and decided I was going to try it out.  They had two signs indicating they are currently training.  It was not busy but people were eating at various tables  when I walked in and was advised they were not open, but in training.  I did leave a little upset because I thought they were doing a \"Soft Opening\" ( look it up if you do not know what it means - The Management here should have considered this instead of turning people away while training!).  I saw online that they opened today and went to the location on Central Ave at 12:18 and saw it was very busy - which is a great sign!  As I was being walked to my table a manager was talking to a table of 5 or 6 apologizing and even asked about wrapping up the food - think one person did not get their food.  I sat down at my table with two ladies seated next to me with two drinks of water and their bills - I thought they were waiting for the server to cash them out, but the one lady said I would be waiting a while.  The server came to my table and asked \"is this your first time here\" - now as you have read above \"NEW LOCATION THAT OPENED TODAY\".  I informed the server that they just opened today (maybe nerves) he was very courteous and knew the menu which is definitely a good trait to have at a restaurant.  After he left the two ladies let me know that they were on their hour lunch break and ordered at 11:30 and had still not got their food - it was 12:24! they also told me it is a chain - which I could have given the server some credit about asking me if I had been here before, but the problem is this is the ONLY location in Arizona.  I saw two other guests get their food to go at a table against the windows and another 5 top appeared to be waiting a long time as well (theme of the day as there were other tables that looked annoyed and had no food on them) The two ladies left and I asked for my order to go (1/3 beef patty on regular bun (no cheese, veggies, meats, sauces, etc. - just plain with a side of sweet potato fries) since I did not want to be there for an hour for a burger & fries.  The total cost came to $13.00 ( can't remember change was about 0.43 - 0.53 cents) which is quite a bit for a plain burger with fries - I did leave $18.00 since all of the problems WERE NOT the fault of the server.    I walked the food back to my office and who did I run into - the two ladies who had left and they were coming from the cafeteria with lunch and could not believe I was back already WITH my Food in hand.    The Burger was pretty good and the fries were okay - I did have to walk back to my office so not 100% fresh - there are many options and ingredients to put on a burger, but be warned that you could be spending $20.00 for a burger with fries!"}
{"text":"Their banana split shake is to die for. It is way better than in and out. We also has their sweet potato fries, Parmesan fries, a make your own turkey burger and the classic burger with onion rings."}
{"text":"We were seated really quickly and the staff was nice and helped with pointing out the build your own menu.  We received the starter which was their variation of deviled eggs.  Delicious.  I have to figure out how they made them.  I just remember bacon in them.  On the other hand it was more than 45 minutes to receive our sandwiches.  Seemed pretty long.  My sandwich was great, but my onion strings were lukewarm.  I'll give them a try again it seemed like they got slammed when we were there and then poof, everyone disappeared."}
{"text":"Burned my burger even I asked for medium rare but every bite, I tasted burn.  I almost cannot taste the burger.  My shoestring fries was cold.  This place was not busy.  They forgot my grilled corn.   Not impressed here."}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries were cold and hard. Had to get them to go because they made me new ones while I finished off my sandwich... I would've rather had them WITH my sandwich instead of after my meal!!! French fries don't automatically come with your sandwiches you have to purchase those separately!! $15 for a sandwich and a soda is just outrageous!"}
{"text":"Great food horrible service. Also the menu doesn't accurately reflect the real prices. Literally waited an hour for our food when the restaurant had about 3 other tables in it."}
{"text":"I actually thought this location was closed awhile back. Phone number is out of order here on yelp and so is the one on the corporate site so don't bother calling them. Food was good, I got my custom built burger which usually taste amazing but tasted different here and not as good. Service was friendly and very attentive even during a busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"This was by far and away the worst service I have ever had in my life. We arrived and there were 35-40 open tables and we had to put our name in and wait 10 minutes. Then, once we finally got a table it was 20 mins before I had to flag down a waitress to help us. They seemed put out by the whole thing. Also, we ordered drinks from the bar and were told that the waitress (that hardly ever came around) had to put the order in. Finally, we wanted to cash out and leave and the waitress never came around to offer the check. Worst service ever!"}
{"text":"Pro tip: If you like your burger med-rare or rare, be sure to get well done. Pictured is their version of med-rare, so use your imagination on how the other temps are cooked.   The server was super nice about getting my burger cooked right, but unfortunately the second time was still mooing. It seemed my version of med-rare was different from theirs, which unfortunately led to a poor experience for me. Sorry Bessie, The Counter didn't do you any justice today"}
{"text":"Good quality ingredients, it is a bit pricey but you are getting what you pay for.  Food Quality seems consistent but the wait staff quality is not that great, everyone is friendly but all 3 times I have been here something or multiple things have gotten messed up and it takes a while to eat here. expect more than an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I continue to eat there. They claim to be custom burgers yet over cook the meat every time. Why ask how I want it cooked when the only temperature they seem to know is well done. Today the waitress was more interested in talking to the bartender than to take a minute and ask how my meal was. I consumed the entire meal without a single table side visit. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"The bison burger and sweet potato fries were great, and the staff was kind and courteous."}
{"text":"The counter is a cool little burger spot. We came here a few nights ago when we were in our way to Valley Bar for a concert. This place reminds me of slater 50/50 in Cali ( they have the ultimate burgers/build ur own). So I didn't get a burger I got a chicken sandwich which was raw. Disappointed I love chicken. I loved that I did a build ur own chicken sandwich. So we get it send back and it comes back fully cooked maybe a little too over Cooked but let me tell u the breeding on that chicken was yummy so crunchy and full of flavor. Along with my sandwich I also go the shoe string fires they were yummy. My husband got a milkshake and the tots omg the tots to die for !!! They have some kick and the bacon was amazing. Our friends who were with us got milk shakes and the brownie with ice cream no shocker it was delish !! So idk if I would come back ever. Maybe for the fires,shakes and brownies."}
{"text":"On my 1 HR lunch break, I walked with a friend to a place that was new in our work area... Upon entering The Counter, we asked the host about the take-out orders and the timeframe for service  because we were on our lunch break. The Host stated that it would be about a 15 minute turn around and we could order from the bar. So we ordered at the bar from the bar server named Nicholas. Here's my order I stated to Nicholas: \"I'd like the Chili Cheese Burger, no tomato but add relish\" as my friend ordered Nicholas asked my friend how he would like his burger cooked, which was not something he asked me so I started to Nicholas at that time \"Could you make my burger Medium Well\" and acknowledged my request. When he brought me the ticket I noticed he entered \"PINK THROUGHOUT\" so I brought that to his attention and he went to explain to me what the differences was between medium and medium-well as, and I looked at him and stated: \"Yes, I said I wanted my burger Medium-Well\""}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing shakes are delicious everything is presented very nice Build your own Burger is the way to go Had a very bad experience there took over an hour for my food and it was not busy What take 15 minutes to get a beer that happened three times never received my last beer that I ordered Ask for to go containers never got them Maybe it was my server Carlton that was a problem I don't know terrible experience"}
{"text":"I want to like this place because of its location and the gluten free options, but the bottom line is that it's just mediocre and way over priced."}
{"text":"Woo hoo! The Counter has the vegan Impossible Burger! It's thick and designed to be \"like meat\" - with the marketing spin that \"it bleeds.\" I had mine well done, so no blood for me. It may be a bit too intense for those that cringe at the idea of meat, but it was pretty good. The Counter is also sensitive to cross contamination and cook it in a separate grill.   You need to inquire about what bread and toppings are vegan, but the servers can bring out a list. They don't have any vegan cheeses.  We got ours with sides of shoestring and sweet potato fries - both are great so it was hard to choose.   They have a veggie club and salads that can be made vegan too. I've heard the non-vegan burgers are good too but can't personally confirm.  Service was fast,friendly and accurate. If you sit by the window you get to see (and feel) light rail trains go by. They also have a nice patio out back for when the weather is agreeable."}
{"text":"I love The Counter and their awesome menu of custom built burgers. The quality is consistent, the ingredients are fresh and tasty, and they have grilled vegetables as a side instead of fries. It's easy to eat a healthy meal here, which I appreciate.   We found ourselves in downtown Phoenix for a concert at the Comerica Theater and wanted a quick meal before the show (and to avoid paying expensive concession prices for junk food once inside the concert venue). After walking a couple of blocks, we saw The Counter and got really excited. I've only been to The Counter restaurants in California and didn't know they had branched out to Arizona.   It wasn't crowded so we were seated immediately. We told the friendly server the second he came over that we were in a little bit of a hurry because we had a concert to get to. He acknowledged the fact and said he'd be mindful of our time. Well, if that is what he calls mindful, he's sorely mistaken. I swear this guy was slower than a sloth, and he ignored us while chatting up other tables. I love a server who is friendly, but we did inform him of our time constraints. My advice is that if you're in a hurry, don't think you have time to eat here. We had allowed a little over an hour to eat (not counting walking time back to the venue), and by the time he took our order and brought our check, we had very minimal time to actually eat our food. Yes, we probably should've allowed more time, but an hour at a burger joint should be sufficient.  I'm still giving this place four stars because the food was delicious. I just wish the server had been a little more attentive."}
{"text":"Since I was in downtown, thought I would treat myself with a new build your burger joint.  Nice trendy area set up, and good service.  This place offers various burger meats to choose from: basic fresh ground beef, organic bison, crab cake to veggie.  They offer various sizes and toppings.  I opted for the 1/3 lb organic bison, horseradish aioli with basic toppings, since I was still in my volunteer uniform that is white.  It was a good burger, that was seasoned well.  My side was shoestring onions, perfectly cooked and a nice seasoned batter.  They also offer some created ones, if you want unique combos.  Definitely worth it to try."}
{"text":"I dropped by to give the Impossible Burger a shot and boy was I impressed. Closest thing I've ever had to a real meat burger without actually being meat itself. The fries are also very good. Our server was very pleasant but it took a long time for us to receive any service after we were seated (he was very apologetic about this). Burger was a tad pricey for what it was."}
{"text":"Ordered a hamburger medium and it was so raw I couldn't eat it. The meat was gushing out. I have ordered rare burgers that where cooked more than this burgers only ate 1/4 of burger because it tasted like I was eating dog food. Onion straws where good and so was the club soda. It's unfortunate when cooks get in a hurry but if I wanted tar tar I would have ordered steak tar tar"}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place but they keep falling on their face. Stopped in today for lunch, waited 45 minutes for a medium rare burger and fries. Finally got it and it was well done. Bartender offered a 25% discount, really?!  Waited 45 minutes and received a burger I didn't order, nice. I give up and I won't be back."}
{"text":"My colleague and I visited The Counter for lunch today (February 3, 2016), as it is conveniently located near our office and we had not yet tried it. We arrived just before noon and were told it would be about 5 minutes before we could be seated. Of course, this was no problem and they seated us shortly thereafter. We placed our order right away and unfortunately, that is when the experience went downhill. It took over an hour from the time that we ordered to get our food. When our food did arrive, the burgers were not prepared properly and they were not even very warm. The waiter only came by one time in the hour we were waiting to see if we needed any refills. Admittedly, we probably should have left and went somewhere else, but we kept thinking that it could not possibly take much longer (we were wrong, obviously).  While we waited, we saw other tables also experiencing ridiculously long wait times. One larger group eventually had to get some of their orders to go, considering most people can only take an hour for lunch. Food was coming out to the same table at different times and customers were very clearly frustrated. The staff half-heartedly apologized for the wait, and blamed the larger group for the delay. However, even with the large group, the restaurant was not filled to capacity, so it was hard to buy that excuse.   I will never return to The Counter, and I would not recommend it to anyone. The food was mediocre at best, and the horrendous service made it a complete waste of time. I cannot possibly imagine how it would take over an hour to get a burger, but The Counter was certainly able to accomplish that."}
{"text":"Excellent build your own burger options. I subbed the Hawaiian Bun and it was great. Awesome adult milkshakes, too. We had the Thin Mint (exactly as it sounds) and the Chocolate Cherry Pinot Noir, which was quite good, but has a decently strong wine flavor. Burgers between $10-$25 and adult shakes between $8-10."}
{"text":"Good food once you get it. Worst service ever!! We're out of onion rings. How is that even possible. So many other places to try, I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"I am new to the area and trying to find good places to eat. I went to get a vegan burger here and it turned out bacon was placed in my burger. Good experience up until that point. I never eat bacon and was a bit upset to have seen I was eating it since I don't eat it for both health and religious reasons.   So, why 4 stars? They were super kind, sorry, and quick to make me a new burger. Multiple employees apologized to me for the mistake and they covered my bill for the night. Amazing PR for a restaurant. I will definitely give them another try   P.S. The impossible burger was great! ^_^"}
{"text":"Freaking yummy Vegan burgers. My fave server is Krista."}
{"text":"I'm bumping up my review by one star. I have returned to the Counter twice and have also gotten takeout. I have had generally positive experiences on my return visits. I went back with my husband. I had the veggie burger again and it did not disappoint. My hubby built his own Burger and he was very pleased with how it was cooked. Service was great and the kitchen did not mess up our order like they did last time.  I also went back with a coworker. This time I had the veggie burger in a build your own salad. I loved it! It was a delicious healthy option. I also ordered takeout online which was quick and convenient. It is very easy to customize your own salad or burger on their website. My only complaint is they forgot a couple ingredients I requested.  Overall, my experience at the Counter improved drastically and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We come in and they sit us down not long after we walked in. We sat and got our menus the paper was silky and was short. I liked when you opened the menu it gave you the  story about how they created the counter. Our server knew a lot about the build your own burger. Which was very awesome. We ordered and he left one menu which i thought was very kind. He came back around 10 minutes and said it should be 3 to 5 more minutes but once he said that it was 10 more. We got our food it was very delicious!! The smokey chipotle aioli was very good it definetly had that smokey kick. Overall the food was great.  The service was slow but the server was great."}
{"text":"Truly best burger ever, I'm sure I've said it before, but this time I mean it! I got the 1/3 pound beef on multi grain bun. I put some basic ingredients but my favorite was the hickory barbecue sauce and my second favorite was the sweet saricha. I always save half of my burger for later. This time I couldn't even save it! Forget the beer or shakes or fries the burger was BOMB! My fiancé loved his chipotle sauce with his burger along with his chili cheese fries.   Get the the deal from Groupon it saves you some money. We will definitely be returning!   P.S. Ask for Ross, he was real cool and gave us all of the tips for being first timers!"}
{"text":"Have had the Impossible Burger in Austin and LA but am happy to finally have it here in PHX. Had it cooked medium, would probably ask for more \"rare\" next time. Our server was severely confused by what \"Vegan\" meant and had to run and ask questions about 7 times (not exaggerating), about what buns and sauces were vegan (after checking she said only the GF bun and ciabatta) she also said the chipotle and horseradish aiolis are vegan, made w Just Mayo. The garlic aioli is not (has buttermilk) After the server asked how the burgers were, she asked if we could tell it's not meat, we told her it's really good/tastes very similar. I asked if she's had the Impossible Burger she said no, then said \"I can always tell if a burger is meat or not because I love meat, like I love McDonald's and I've tried veggie burgers before and they don't taste like meat.\" So I said she really should try the impossible burger I think she'd like it.  I really think the staff needs more education if they are going to serve the impossible burger. I can imagine if that same server was telling an interested Impossible Burger novice she would not have any clue what to say, and likely not make the Impossible Burger sound very good. But for a $74 meal (2 beers, 2 fries, burgers and tip) it would be nice to have someone who knows the menu and doesn't go on about how much better \"real\" meat is as you are eating their non-meat burger.  ***the Impossible Burger itself is delicious!!! This review is for the experience."}
{"text":"Super cool spot. Really good food. Good beer. Excellent service from my new buddy at the bar. Vegetarian options, a huge plus."}
{"text":"A great burger spot from California, with many options and sides. Perfect for downtown"}
{"text":"We arrived with a group of 10 about 30 minutes before closing time.  They waved us in with big smiles.  They were so kind and accommodating.  Great service and tasty burgers!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but felt this I had to do! Went there on Friday evening. We out our name in and was told it'd be a 1/2 hour wait even though the tables were empty. The hostess who looked completely stoned, told us they could not seat the empty tables so they wouldn't overwhelm the kitchen. What?! When we finally got seated no one came to our table for easily 15 minutes. We had to ask and was told the hostess never told the waiter she had sat us. By then we filled out our orders and gave to the waiter. We ordered shakes and our burgers. Our shakes took forever to come out and all came out one at a time. When our burgers did arrive they were over cooked and 1/2 the items we included on our forms were not there. The only bright light if you will was the manager who profusely apologized and picked up the cost of our shakes. This place is NOT set up to be a custom burger or shake place. There were only 2 blenders for the shakes and I cannot tell you what was going in with the kitchen. Unless they make some major changes, I would skip this place on your next visit downtown."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this place to try it out. They give you a lot of food for what you pay for and a lot of different combinations to choose for."}
{"text":"I give them 3 stars because the sweet sriracha fries are out of this world!!! When I came here, the place had only been open for a few weeks and it was obvious.  It was really slow and the service was not very good.  The burger was mediocre at best, but the large selection of dipping sauces was awesome.  I would come back for the sriracha fries, but nothing else."}
{"text":"Tip: don't come during the week at lunch time! It took my daughter and I fifteen minuets to get seated.  Regardless the wait, the food was pretty good and I liked how you can customize your own burger. I really enjoyed the siracha sauce and I highly recommend it. Also the shoestring fries are really good."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery for the first time using Amazon food delivery. Only got half of our order. Amazon is taking care of it and having  the items re-sent but I don't really like eating dinner in stages. Food was good but probably won't order from them again since they can't get the order correct."}
{"text":"Great food with great friends. Best hamburger in the Valley. Wonderful service and perfect way to celebrate my son's graduation."}
{"text":"Dang good \"build your own burger\" option with a full bar right next to the rail stop. It's convenient and worth the stop."}
{"text":"Went here last night before we planned on going ice skating right nearby. It was a cool place, had a regular menu with burgers, sandwiches, etc. and the option to build your own burger. The food was good, I made my own chicken sandwich and it turned out very good. It had a cozy little diner feel, which was nice!   A couple of the things on the menu (drinks mostly) that we tried to order they didn't have anymore, which was kind of a bummer, but the waitress said they're waiting on their new menus, which happens!   All in all a good little burger place! Would probably go here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Make your own burger. Make your own grilled cheese. Make your own shake.  Have it your way for real!  The medium-well burger we ordered was cooked to perfection! The vanilla shake was fabulous! The grilled cheese was wonderful!  We were greeted as soon as we walked in and multiple employees stopped by to check on is while we were there.  A real team environment.  A real inciting environment.  A real comfortable environment.  As I said at the beginning...an awesome place!"}
{"text":"Went Sunday at 5:30. Not crowded and sat at the bar. Good selection of beers and other drinks. Burger was great! Charbroiled perfectly yum...,We did the make your own and we were served quickly. Sweet potato Fries were ok hence the drop from a 5 star. It's a great place for a good burger I will tell ya that!"}
{"text":"This is Jordan's favorite burger place of all time. You can build your burger with a ton of goodies.  I even made my burger into a super duper salad, as I can't eat bread. Best root beer float I've ever had.  The Tiramesu shake was devine."}
{"text":"Deliciousness - 5/5 Happiness - 4/5  I'm drooling just typing this. Hamburgers will always be my favorite food. And when done right, I turn into a devourer of delicious meat. And add aioli to the mix and I'm in heaven (sue me, I am an aioli psycho).  The Counter is one of my favorites. The shakes and beer selection are decent (plus, you can have shakes with liquor in it. YES!). The fries are all right (to be fair, I am not a shoestring guy). But the burgers are king. They can be decently cheap or pretty expensive thanks to a sizable create your own burger menu that features a TON of aioli sauces (chipotle's my favorite).   My last trip, I finally opted for the turkey burger and it was just as delicious - a rare feat indeed (the last time I found a turkey burger equal to a hamburger was at Delux). The bison burger is also a nice change to the traditional beef. A highly recommended place for burger bliss if you are in town."}
{"text":"This is the third Counter I've been to. The one in NYC is a little above average but not the best burgers around. The one in Marina del Rey, California, is excellent. As good a Turkey Burger as you'll find, very good fish, great fries and excellent service. This place? It's awful!  I'm actually quite upset with myself that I didn't complain, and paid their high prices for awful food. The 1/2 lb turkey burger came in 2 very dried out, rubbery patties. The fries had obviously been sitting for a while. They were also dry. Dinner for two, over $45 + tip. Less than mediocre service.   Anyone going here should know not all locations are this bad. What I'd like to know though, is how the head office can allow their brand to be trashed like this."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurant experiences of my life.  20 minutes after we were seated, we flagged down a waiter as no one seemed interested in serving us.  55 minutes later, we still didn't have our food.  After repeated attempts to get an ETA, the waitstaff had no answers and began to ignore our inquiries.  We left to get to our concert on time.  I can't comment on the food since I never got any.  Avoid this place at all costs especially on concert nights.  I wish I could give this place 0 stars."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place that sold the Impossible Burger and we stumbled across this place. It's right downtown near everything. As we walked in, the gentleman behind the counter welcomed us. He asked us how we were doing and said to pick any seat we liked. He explained that they had service on the patio as well. We found our perfect table and sat down. Within minutes our server came over. His name was Jeffery. He asked if we had been here before. We explained that we came in to try the new Impossible Burger. He said he was excited for us to try it and said we would love it. He immediately took our drink order and suggested appetizers for us. He came back to chat while our appetizers were being prepared. He was telling us how they are one of the few places that offer the Impossible Burger in Arizona. He said lots of people were coming in to try it. Our appetizers came out just a few minutes later. They were hot and delicious. Jeffery came back and gave us drink refills and asked how we liked the appetizers. He was very attentive.   As we were finishing, our burgers came out. They were presented nicely on the plate. They smelled wonderful and tasted amazing. They have average portion sizes. Not to big and not to small.  I highly suggest you check this place out and ask for Jeffery, he will take great care of you."}
{"text":"Today, I ate the most amazing burger in the history of burgers, a burger that any cow would be glad to contribute to. This is not a budget burger -- for the \"under $10 dinner,\" I'm still all about the Smashburger -- but it's a burger worth budgeting for.  My original reasoning was that The Counter is in a really handsome historic building, one that's fascinated me for years. I figured \"custom built burger\" would be like Fuddruckers. No. No. It is \"like Fuddruckers\" only in the sense that a luxury golf course is \"like\" a sparse patch of front lawn or Saks is \"like\" JC Penney.  First and most important, The Counter tackles the concept of \"custom\" with fervor. Your burger can be beef, chicken, tuna, veggie-veggie, and I think a couple of things I forgot. You can have it on a bun of several varieties (including gluten-free) or as a salad. There are SIXTEEN cheese possibilities (including a vegan one) and twenty-six sauces. And that's before you even get to the veggie toppings. If you're innately indecisive, bring some dice to roll for your burger's capabilities. (If you're innately geeky, calculate the permutations and make a chart for working your way through them.)  Second, the burger is jaw-droppingly excellent. I had beef on a whole-grain bun with nicoise olives and spicy pickles, with some form of Italian dressing. The first bite was a revelation. As I got to the last quarter of my burger, I kept delaying because I didn't want it to be over. I like burgers, but I do not ordinarily get this blissed-out over a burger.  Third, there is craft beer. That's almost mandatory in Phoenix these days, but it'd be a loss if it weren't there.  Fourth, the service is outstandingly charming. I love staff who walk the walk on being so good that you'll WANT to tip generously (as I did) rather than discriminating based on stereotypical expectations about tipping.  Fifth, I was so blissed-out by the burger that I gave a thumbs-up to key lime pie on my waiter's suggestion, and it was quite a fine pie. I will now be living on beans and wads of lettuce for the rest of the week, while exercising vigorously, but it was worth it.  Eat here. Bring dice."}
{"text":"I guess I expected a little more from the burger.  I like medium rare and waiter said that would be cold center and highly suggested medium.  Told him I wanted pink and he assured me it would be pink.  Not the case.  It was over cooked and dry.   Fried onions were tough and hard to chew needed to at least slice a little.   Nothing to brag about"}
{"text":"Cool location but it looks better than it tastes..I like my burger to be seasoned before it's cooked, they don't do that here. I wish they had a smaller burger, the 1/3 lb is the smallest..too big for me. The pink lemonade is awesome and sweet potato fries were plentiful.  Service is good but not very fast, took over 20 mins to get our burgers."}
{"text":"good food, burgers taste great. a little pricey for a burger that doesn't come with fries or anything else but if your downtown and willing to pay the food is worth it. waiter was attentive. there is a groupon which I recommend you use $"}
{"text":"came in half hour before closing and was ignored. The staff was definitely ready to go home and did not care if they had customers coming in. To be honest the food isn't anything special."}
{"text":"The Counter is so conveniently located, it's hard not to pass by without thinking of stopping in for a bite to eat. That's why I've been back twice since my first visit (when I couldn't get take out - but we won't speak of that again).  For my second visit, I dined-in and sat at the bar. Thought I chose a good spot, but folks still bumped me as they passed behind. Next time - table only.   The couple next to me was sharing a burger and side. Not sure if it filled their bellies, but they seemed to enjoy every bite. On my other side someone ordered a grilled cheese without side. Looked a bit skimpy, so I can't imagine how filling that could have been.  Every dish coming out of the kitchen looked yummy. The burgers were stacked and even though I'm not much of a flesh eater, I was thinking \"dayum, me want burger.\"  Anyway, reality. Like I said in my first review: I would be the idiot who went all veggie on 'em. So my build-your-own-burger sans burger turned out to be a bowl of salad. With a side order of yam fries without question.  I was impressed with the salad - very fresh, very crisp, very green, very good. And the yam fries were tasty. Salted, not sweeted like other restaurants are serving them. The contrast of sweet to salty flavor was excellent and the fries accompanied my salad con mucho harmony.   Tongue was happy, tummy be happy, me happy.  For my third visit I had a jones for yam fries! or sweet pos as some folk calls 'em. I ordered take out. Decided on the build-your-own-grilled cheese. Requested all kinds of fixin's.   In my head, i pictured the guys in the kitchen stuffing topping after topping between slices of bread and wrapping up a fat sammich for me - just like the fat burgers they serve. Nope, wrong answer. My grilled cheese was still on the skimpy side, though not as skimped as the grilled cheese the woman had during my second visit.   When I got to my destination, I added two more toppings of my own. Don't get me wrong, it was a good sandwich, but nothing ticks me off more than having to re-dress something that was build-your-own in the first place.   Tsk, tsk. Sweet pos were a total failure. I ate them straight from the box, but they tasted like the kitchen had either re-warmed them or twice fried (overcooked) them.  Smh. What does disappointment mean?  noun - the feeling of sadness or displeasure caused by the non-fulfillment of one's hopes or expectations.  My jones was gone's."}
{"text":"If you can't get what you want yo eat here, you're simply not trying. Lots of different proteins, more than a dozen cheeses, dressings and sauces galore, 30 toppings on breads or greens. Be decisive, be bold. You'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite burger joints. We always get the veggie burgers. They aren't mushy! So yummy with the build your own! Great idea! Fries and onion strings rule!"}
{"text":"While I had an issue with my visit, no question the 5 stars is deserved. I sat at the bar during lunch and the place was busy. I did the build your own burger and chose a turkey burger. When it came out it was a veggie burger. I told the staff and they got it fixed right away. Even took 50% off my bill, which I wasn't expecting. The food was great (likes having multiple sauces to try), the place was clean, and staff was great. Definitely a place you should hit up."}
{"text":"I have been here twice after checking the hours to make sure they were open and was unable to eat there both times. One time they just had a sign on the door saying they we closed after I got a large group together to go after an event I was running, and another time they were closed for a convention after I made a trip down from Mesa to go. I have never had this happen anywhere else, but had it happen here twice. I've heard the food is good, but if I have to call and make sure they are open every time that I want a burger, I'll just go to the Burger Joint at Roosevelt Square which is an amazing burger."}
{"text":"I was staying across the street at the Renaissance hotel for one night, and I was looking for someplace close by to eat. It's tough to be closer than The Counter, so I gave it a shot.  The food was excellent. They have this massive menu of options for building a burger, including gluten free buns or a no-bun burger bowl option (which I selected). Pick a meat, a cheese, unlimited cool toppings (I went with things like jicama, grilled onions, cucumbers, pickles and jalapeños) and a sauce. I also added a side of sweet potato fries. Both the burger bowl and the fries were very tasty.   After eating, I decided to have an adult milkshake. Again, you can pick one of their options or build your own, so I went with chocolate sauce, peanut butter and chocolate chips with Kahlua (good choices, me!). I appreciated that I could get a not-so-huge 12 ounce shake, too (16 ounces would have been more than I needed, though it was an option).  I sat at the bar, in part so I could watch a football game, and the bartender / server was super friendly and helpful the whole time. Keep in mind that I was there at 5:30 on a Thursday, so it wasn't crowded at all, but still, their service was great.  Big thumbs up from me! Burgers and boozy shakes... yum."}
{"text":"The Counter was very good. The build your own burger is the way to go, with unlimited possibilities for combinations."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers and were all very happy we did! We ordered the build your own burger, bison & goat greens bowl, and the Meltdown. Everything was delicious and service was friendly and quick. The menu is a little pricey, especially for the lunch crowd, but you get good food and quick service for the price. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Concept was great but they have some serious kinks to work out.  Prob won't come back."}
{"text":"Avoid this place like the plague. Absolute worst customer service I have experienced to date. Went here for lunch today with a friend, had to wait ten minutes even though half the tables were open. So when we were seated, we immediately ordered since we both had to return to work afterwards. After waiting an hour, I asked the waiter if we could just get our food to go and have the checks - he brought us the checks and told us that they were boxing up the food now and it'd be out in a second. Signed our checks and sat there for another ten minutes, so it was obviously a lie that they were boxing up our food, which by the way was just a hamburger with lettuce. So I went up yet again and asked to speak to a manager, and the girl said a manager would be right out. I stood there waiting for another 5 minutes and no one came out. Then, our waiter walks out with our food bagged up and says here you go. At this point we didn't even want the food, we just wanted to be refunded as we had wasted an entire hour plus some waiting for a very basic hamburger. He then was extremely rude when I told him we didn't want the food and we just wanted to be refunded. Will not be returning. Paid almost $20 for a burger that took an hour = not worth it"}
{"text":"We are in town for a conference and stopped at the counter because of the smell. We ordered the PB & Nutella shake and the Birthday Cake shake. Delicious recommendations from our server!  We also made our own custom burgers and took them to go. They were delicious also- but beware it quickly adds up in price! The sweet potato fries weren't worth it- ended up throwing them out."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Best grilled cheese!! (I put cheddar, American and smoked gouda cheese on mine with sprouts) and AMAZING Parmesan Fries!! Love it here!! Really cool place!! Highly recommend!   Vegetarian and Vegan options as well!"}
{"text":"Vegan alert- Tonight I went to The Counter in downtown Phx, and the main reason is because this restaurant has something unique in the vegan world, which is The Impossible Burger! I had an Impossible Burger salad. I had an Impossible Burger on Ciabatta. I had their shoestring fries, and then I couldn't eat anymore. This place is a gem downtown. It was not crowded in the least, it was decorated like Christmas, well-lit, good music, and a great wait staff. I recommend this place for any vegan who really wants to enjoy an Impossible Burger, and believe me they are good! The counter is open till 9 p.m. so you can get off work and take your time and enjoy a great vegan meal. Merry Christmas."}
{"text":"The bison burgers here are SPOT ON! Juicy, love the fresh ingredients and we LOVED the shoe string French fries! Visited twice this week. Today was chilly and breezy, we were walking the dogs and stopped in to sit on the balcony... the waiter started the fire - SUPER GREAT and necessary. Tried different toppings today. OOOOH, So good! Wait staff, AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, don't try to come on your lunch hour. Service is really slow. Been here 30 minutes and just got our drinks. Not the first time, but certainly the last. The food isn't good enough to compensate for the wait times."}
{"text":"This place has it all! Cute atmosphere, accessible location, amazing food and great drink options!  Happened to be in the downtown area on a Sunday, having a little adventure with the niece and nephew.  Lunch time hits, tummys grumbling, we find The Counter. And what a great find it was! Literally stumbling distance from the light rail this place does not disappoint! My nephew and I select the create your own burgers (CYOB) and my niece chooses the kids cheeseburger sliders.  The options are plentiful for the CYOB and honestly could become a little overwhelming for someone that is indecisive.  I go with a turkey burger on a pretzel bun and gouda, grilled onions, artichoke hearts and the standard lettuce, tomato set up. Condiments/sauces options are plentiful and come on the side so I would suggest trying a few.  My nephew went with a beef burger on a pretzel bun with coleslaw and a couple other items and a side of sweet potato fries that we shared.  Food was fast, fresh and filling!  Service and staff were quick and friendly.    We decided we would definitely be back as we have so many other CYOB combos to try!"}
{"text":"I came here and build my own burger. It was pretty empty but the burger I made was pretty solid!   I put a pineapple on there with some other ingredients and it came out really good. My wife made her own as well and it didn't come out that great so it really depends on how good you are at mixing stuff up. They also have premade burgers that look pretty boss. But I would recommend this place to others .I like that at least"}
{"text":"I have been twice for lunch. Both times my order was wrong when (eventually) delivered. Once my order was delivered to the table next to mine. I saw the guy pick in up then take the top off. He told the waiter it wasn't his and the waiter realized his mistake. We had a good laugh when we realized that his lunch partner was already eating my lunch partners burger. We all got a free lunch. If you want to wait for a $20 burger this is your place. Just check your order for accuracy and bring your gold card. Frankly, they are over priced and the one hour I have for lunch isn't enough time when I have to order twice."}
{"text":"On 5/24 I went to dinner with friends who are fasting for Ramadan. Right away our server made a condescending remark about us looking like we were on a time restriction. What exactly made us look that way?...  We were there a bit early so we asked if the orders could be put in to come out at 7:30, the server said they were too busy, so we said we'll hold on ordering. No problem at all. He threw the slips on the table and another server returned who was asked to take over for him. I myself am not Muslim but I couldn't believe the disrespect I saw that night. This server's lack of tolerance is reflective of your business and is unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!! was trying to go to Bitter & Twisted but they were closed so my fiancé picked this place since it was still really close, and I'm so glad B&T was closed. this has become my new favorite place! the staff was so friendly, I loved the people watching view and the customize your burger was the best thing ever!! the prices were good too, I assumed it would be expensive but not at all! can't wait to go back!  ps-i I just wish they had more margarita selections."}
{"text":"Went in because I ate at the location in Walnut Creek and loved it. This one wasn't as good. My malt was excellent but my burger was only ok. The server was fantastic, she was fast and kept coming by to apologize for the wait which was in no way long or unexpected at lunch time."}
{"text":"Friend and I just fell into this place. We were downtown on a Sunday just trying to find any place that was open. We popped in and they were closing within the hour so we kept it quick. Friendly service and we tried their happy hour food. Was surprised that they were having happy hour and closing at the same time. Weird! Anyway, I enjoyed the loaded tots and my friend had the burger sliders with a beer. I wish I could say I enjoyed the loaded tots but I did not. It tasted so plastic, so processed, so gross... The cheese on top was out of some factory and you could sure taste it. The tots themselves just tasted like some frozen crap... Didn't go in with many expectations and left the same way for the most part."}
{"text":"I was hesitant trying this place cuz overall rate wasn't too great. But I like how you can customize your own burger with pretty much unlimited toppings. We went there and atmosphere was pretty nice. The waitress was friendly and explained to us how we can customize our own burgers. When you order a burger, you can get the side with $3.5. We got parmesan cheese fries and cheese tots. The waitress brought those sides as appetizers as we requested. They were all really good. I definitely recommend this place if you are in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It is located next to the light rail on Central and Adams. The atmosphere is very laid back, seat yourself, customize your burger and wash it down with a cold beer! I will definitely revisit this place. Food was good, prices were good for the amount of food you get! Bring your appetite!"}
{"text":"Will not return. Waited 25 minutes for a milkshake. 50 minutes in...still no food. When asked about wait waitress told me food would be ready in another 25 minutes. Had to leave and get food elsewhere: waited over an hour for nothing. Ridiculous seeing as restaurant wasn't even 1/2 full and there was more than 5-6 waiters on staff. Suggestion: avoid."}
{"text":"I would give this place four stars but the impossible Burger pushed it to five. It is insanely good! I've been to the counter a handful of times and have always had a pleasant experience. Few good beers on tap, decent sprouted veggie burger and delicious parm fries. They recently added the impossible Burger and omg, game changer! I went twice this weekend, and had a great time and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I just had an excellent meal here at The Counter. The Bison is Gouda burger was so delicious. I'd give this place 4 stars on that alone but the bartender, Nick, made it a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"If you're craving a quality burger, this is the place to come! They have plenty of burger options on their menu, amongst other things besides burgers, but to get the real experience, you need to create your own burger! They have tons of toppings, various meats, buns, and even bunless for those carb conscious folks! Steven was our waiter. He was very pleasant and gave us recommendations. The atmosphere was cool, with good music playing.  If you're like me and like extras or a higher quality meat, you will walk away with a 20.00 burger, but is it ever worth it!!! And their sweet potatoes are to die for!! Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for lunch during the workweek. The food isn't mind-blowing, but it's good.   Parking here isn't awful, but you may have to travel around the block to find street parking. I parked in the underground parking lot at 1st, before Central.   The restaurant itself has a diner-esque feel. It made me want a milkshake. There were a lot of attorneys in the restaurant, which makes sense because the restaurant is situated in the middle of all the law office buildings, and is close to the courthouses.   Service: We were greeted immediately after we walked into the restaurant. Both the person who sat us at our table and our server were keen to help us decide on lunch. This was our first time here, so they took the time to explain the menu and how we could order a speciality burger, or create our own burger. They were attentive, but not overbearing.   Food: My boyfriend customized a bison burger - 1/3 lb. organic patty with brie, kale, and a couple other items. I got the $11 lunch combo with the Old Fashioned burger (tomato, lettuce, onion, cheese) and a side of sweet potato fries. The burgers were surprisingly really good. They were both on brioche buns that were flavourful and delightfully chewy. The bison was delicious. My Old Fashioned burger was exactly what I expect out of a good burger. I'd probably try customizing a burger next time though.   The sweet potato fries were pretty underwhelming. They were slightly warm at best, under-seasoned, and limp. I wouldn't order those again, and that makes me sad because I like sweet potato fries. A lot.   With so many choices for lunch in the area, I don't know when I'll be back here again. For people who want a quick and filing meal, I'd recommend The Counter."}
{"text":"The Burgers are great. If that's all you care about, stop reading here. But the service... I've never watched a slower bartender in my life. While waiting the 25min for my drink I watched my server/bartender spend the entire time scooping ice cream into the blenders and joking with another server. I figured he forgot the drink which was fine until of course he remembers to make it right when my burger shows up. I'm not about washing down my burger with a glass of bourbon... and I notice the sticker still on the lemon. I flagged a different server and she was happy to take it back. When our server finally comes back we ask for the check ASAP since we had to run. He drops off the bill but never comes back to get the card... another 15minutes and I have to walk it to the cashier myself... but yeah, the burger was good."}
{"text":"Just three little girls roaming around downtown Phoenix working on a photoshoot and we stumbled upon this place after walking in the heat for 20 minutes trying to find a place to eat. Best decision ever. A great location and a great find in our dire situation. The staff was pleasant and the food was great. It's our newest food spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Onion straws were phenomenal. We had the counter burger medium rare and yummmm!!!! Also tasted the strawberry banana milkshake and it was delicious. Our server was very kind and helpful. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent The Counter when we lived in California, so we were super excited to see they opened one in Phoenix too!! We love the build your own burger. They have tons of options for a meat and potatoes guy like my husband to a vegan leaning vegetarian like me. We thought the service and food were both top notch."}
{"text":"I wish we had one in Tampa.  I loved the create your own.  The turkey meat burger was awesome with my hand selected toppings and not over priced.  My friend loved her beef burger and it was cooked spot on.  I wanted an adult milkshake, but had to pass because of a work mtg after.  The sides are good too - shoestring fries, sweet pot fries and onion straws.  The service was good too.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Love the selection of toppings, the choices of burgers to choose from & the quality of the food itself. The milkshakes are a nice addition too, perfect ending to a great burger!"}
{"text":"Other than being expensive, the food was good. Not the absolute best but it was edible and my burger was big as hell. I literally had to cut it in half and smash it down because it was extra tall. I loved the atmosphere and my server was cool. Bam review done."}
{"text":"Super expensive. Long wait time to be sat AND to receive order. Food was ok - nothing spectacular. Tasty fries. Undercooked burger - second time I've ordered medium and my food bled. Literally blood dripping onto my plate. Didn't want to deal with the hassle of asking to cook longer when it took 45 minutes to receive my food. Staff friendly, yet overwhelmed. I think at two attempts to love this place, I'll stop. They will constantly make money because of their location - don't need to be amazing. Five guys is around the corner."}
{"text":"I enjoy The Counter and it's concept. But twice now I have ordered a burger medium rare and it came out well done. Not only that but today I should sent it back as the outside of the burger was burned. The salad upon which the burger sat was very good and the veggies were fresh. A little lite on the roasted peppers. French fries were also good. Next time the burger comes well done or burned I will send it back. On the check it stated \"pink throughout\" and there was no pink to be found."}
{"text":"The food here is always consistently delicious. Its so good that i am willing to endure that finding parking is a huge pain. We went on a Saturday night and it was packed - packed more than usual. Our service was really slow- since i have been in the past and the service was excellent - i wont hold it against them. Pickle chips, chili cheese fries, sweet potato fries are what we get and share with our burgers."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in with my husband. I wasn't paying much attention to the menu (you know...Friday night brain dead) so I didn't realize the bison burger came on a salad instead of a bun, but it was AWESOME. Really tasty, the salad itself was fresh and had some nice touches, the smoked gouda round on top of the burger was topped with an olive salad and marinated artichokes. I saw later that it was clearly on the Salads page. (Oops, but a happy accident.)  The nutella and salted pretzel shake was a MAJOR disappointment = all pretzel and NO discernible nutella at all. I returned it in favor of the Sweet Peach adult shake, which was very good.  My husband opted for the chili burger which was messy (as a chili burger must be) and delicious. The fries were excellent, and his Thin Mint Shake was delish!  Overall, go there and enjoy. But avoid the nutella and salted pretzel shake."}
{"text":"This might have been the best burger I've ever eaten. The create-your-own is an awesome system and they have a ton of choices! I went during lunch and had great service sitting at the bar. Without a doubt, this was the best made burger I've ever eaten. Cooked to perfection, and made with high quality ingredients.   I would absolutely recommend trying this restaurant! 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"My son selected this place for a birthday trip to Phoenix.  The good: the burgers were flavorful, juicy,  as cooked perfectly.  The bad: Service: it is insanely slow. The place was nearly empty,  but it took forever to get our food. It felt like over 30 minutes. My son ordered a milkshake and it took over 15 minutes just to get that. After we got our food, we were pretty much ignored. When I discovered they had forgotten to put bacon on my burger,  I had finished half of it before I saw the server again to explain the error.   Hidden charges: the server encouraged us to choose different sauces \"they all come on the side,  so you're not committed. You can choose a bunch.\" Um, they charge for every side after your first. I ordered one with my burger,  but meant as a side for my fries and I was charged. Also: they charge for drink refills (at least for lemonade). They don't tell you that when they ask if you want a refill.   Mistakes: they forgot the bacon on my burger. When they finally (I was done eating at that point) brought out a side of bacon,  half of it was burnt and inedible  (see pic).  Overall: great burgers,  but disorganization, poor service and insane prices make this a no return place for me."}
{"text":"Vame for happy hour had the hot wings 1/2 dozen. $5. Between 3-6 most of my wings were burnt and small. Good way to mis your own ingredients although pretty dry burger no seasoning to the meat. Green chilis werent sautéed just plain."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Irvine CA one a few years ago and loved it.  We had a groupon for this one b/c it was part of our birthday kidnap day w/ our older grandsons.  Oh my.  Waitress was okay-I warned her that our 8 yr old gets VERY out of sorts when hungry and to please try and get the boys orders out asap.  She said she would-25 minutes later she brought JUST theirs out.  One had his burger looking like charcoal squares.  We didn't get our meals until the boys were almost done!  Really? 35 minutes to bring out some burgers and fries and then there wasn't an apology about the burned ones either.  Then we had some $$ left on the groupon and ordered some desserts to go-took her another 15 minutes to box up a cookie and some blueberry crisp.   Food was good, but the wait wasn't and it was pretty pricey too."}
{"text":"First of let me start by saying if you go make sure the manager knows it's your first time because we got a free appetizer since it was our first time. The fries were so good and it had so much chili we never ran out. My favorite was the HD chicken and the sauce they give you with it is great! The Counter Burger was also really good and the meat was cooked just right!"}
{"text":"If they had better service, I would have given a higher rating.,  The food was good, but the waiter was not.  He was never to be found in the restaurant, and it is not that big.  It took 15 for my daughter to get her lemonade, then she was brought the wrong kind.  We did not get the side of fries we ordered, then when we did, they were the wrong ones.  Just smah."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late burger on the way back to hotel. Everything was custom. You fill out a checklist of toppings and it comes out like you want it. Good diner feel inside. Staff was very friendly and always had a smile on their face. Small selection of wine and beer. Burger was awesome! I got mine to go cause it was later in the evening. Only downside is your paying $9.99 for a one party hamburger. Pricy to say the least. The hamburger patties wasn't extra large or anything. Prob won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to grab a Burger at the bar and watch the FSU game during my lunch break. Sat for 10 minutes while the bar tender completely ignored me and talked to her friends at the bar. Didn't even get a water... Got up and walked out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food the few times I've been here. The custom menu makes it so that you cannot get anything you don't like. There's no losing on the custom build! The only problem I have, and it's completely a #firstworldproblem is that the patties are really thick. Thus, if you get more than just one or two toppings, that thing is going to fall apart when you go tot take one bite. If you want a lot of toppings, you'd do better to get a \"burger salad\" unless you have an abnormally large mouth. The price is in the $10+ range, but you get what you pay for. If you go in, make sure you are decided on to-go or dine-in: if you say dine-in, realize the lunch rush is in full tilt and you don't have 90 minutes to kill, then decide make it a to-go order...well, let's just say your service will be substandard. Minor gripes, nothing to get in a twist over. Eat here, I highly recommend it. If you don't like what you got, you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"GET THE GROUPON.   Such a good deal for a delicious burger. Customizable with qualityingredients. My burger had grilled pineapple, bacon, cheddar blend, lettuce and green chiles... and it was amazing. Going back tonight and bringing some friends. At such a great location close to work and home, I now know where to get a good burger.   I don't know if it's just me, but I would much rather pay $30 ($15 for $30 worth of food on groupon) on a delicious meal for two than $20 at Five Guys for \"just okay\" food.  Spoil yourself!   Great environment and friend staff too.   The only quirk about it is that when the light rail is moving, the ground shakes slightly. Not an issue for me! Love love love this place."}
{"text":"So happy our group ran across this great restaurant! The decor is great, everything is spotless, and the tasty food is high quality. The best part for us was the service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his work, as well as friendly and kind. There was another waiter that would run to open the door for anyone that approached. Great customer service! We will be back.  Also, the sweet potato fries are delicious!"}
{"text":"We been here 4 times. The shakes are good. The burgers are ok. The servers will make your experience worthwhile. The first young Landu was so nice. Tonight we had the pleasure of meeting Christa as our server. Very nice, lots of personality and energy. The food was ok."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to Phoenix from Los Angeles.  We would frequent The Counter in Marina del Rey and LOVE IT.  So today, November 14, 2015 at 12:45 we wanted try out the one here in Phoenix on Central.  It was the WORST experience I have ever had.  For starters, we sat at the bar and weren't acknowledged for 5 minutes and it wasn't even busy! We finally get acknowledged by Macy who now takes our drink order. I'll be candid, I don't think she wanted to be there, no smile, was complaining, seemed miserable and my husband and I actually witnessed her tell a server, \"I don't think this is what was ordered, but give it to her and if she doesn't like it, I will take it off their bill.\"   So we finally place our order and my husband creates his own burger and I always get the BLT with avocado and extra crispy bacon.  Well our food arrives and it's NOT crispy bacon.  I take it off the sandwich and tell Macy that I asked for crispy bacon and she says \"Oh, I forgot to put that in when I placed the order.  I replied with \"I would like to get what I ordered.\"  So she comes out with a plate of 3 pieces of bacon and apologizes and says \"I'm sorry, they are stingy back there and if I bring more they are going to want me to charge you extra for it.\"  I had this stunning look on my face like are you F-ing kidding me, its your mistake and I would have to pay extra.  Macy said that she took 25% off of our bill, but our bill came out to $30 something dollars and only .30 cents was taken off, but I left it alone and figured I would bring it here to Yelp.  I couldn't believe the customer service that we received.  Clearly the wrong person is behind the bar. She was not sociable and if John Taffer was to ever go their he would rip Macy a new one or even FIRE her. The kicker to this scenario is that before our food came out we witnessed a group of 3 men saying \"It's not even busy in here, what is taking so damn long.\" Turns out these guys came in for lunch on their lunch break and had been waiting for over 10 minutes to get their bill so they could go back to work.  One man finally got up and tracked the waitress down and said, \"we need our check, we have to get back to work.\"  They were clearly upset at the service they received considering the place was empty. One of the men ended up leaving her a note on the receipt, which I don't know what it said, but the waitress clearly thought it was funny!  I can honestly say that management needs to step it up at this location and hopefully will be doing some serious customer service training soon.  I WILL NOT be going back anytime soon and am sad that I can't get my money back for this experience. Oh and I wouldn't recommend  anyone else to go to this location either."}
{"text":"My first experience here was terrible! I almost missed my flight because of a mix up between my waiter and the kitchen. However, I'm back here again because I was offered a \"free meal voucher\" for my inconvenience last time.   The burgers here are undeniably great! You can put pretty much anything you could imagine on your burger..  if you can make it here during happy hour (3-6). The appetizers are a good value.   In summery, this place won me over. I'll be back."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the place is nice. The music isn't overwhelmingly loud and the setting pretty modern looking. I went on an early afternoon on Saturday and it wasn't that busy. Our server was very friendly and next to us was a big party of first-timers, so the server did a whole presentation about how to build your own burger. I've read that service has been bad for a lot of people, but I didn't have that experience at all. Maybe it just happens when it is super busy.  I shared the fried dill pickles with apricot sauce.... and it was so good! That sauce was great and I used the remaining on my burger. I ended up getting the Official Counter Burger. It was good, but nothing to write home about. The mushrooms and onions strings were good. The beef was cooked the way I like it as well. However, the bun was just too buttery for me. It overpowered the taste of anything else. I like when buns are buttered, but this was too much. I wish I had a chance to get a shake or malt, because that part of the menu looked amazing. Maybe next time. I'd say it's worth another shot with a different type of burger and some dessert."}
{"text":"i have to say I was very disappointed with my burger. The patty was cold and the sautéed mushrooms and roasted red peppers were cold  as well, as if they were picked from a container on the counter. A little unsolicited tip... even if they are not freshly made, warm them up! That alone will make a big difference in the final product. I had the chili as a side and it was good but again it could have been warmer.   For a place that specializes on burgers, it did not meet my expectations. My wife and I spent $50 on a quick dinner, we could have gone pretty much anywhere else for about the same."}
{"text":"My coworker and I checked out The Counter for lunch yesterday. We liked it, but we didn't love it. Mario's the type of person who can eat a moderate sized meal and be full for hours; I, however, am hungry within an hour of eating. So while he was content with the portions well into the afternoon, I couldn't wait to eat something more (which lead to another afternoon burying my face in a bucket of fro-yo).  The food itself was good. We started with the Sweet Sriracha fries. They were pretty good and we devoured them before our burgers arrived. While many of the specialty burgers sounded great, we opted to build our own burgers. My bacon (of course) and jalapeno cheese burger, with dill pickles and spinach was perfectly cooked to medium. It wasn't greasy, which was pleasant.  Service was attentive without being suffocating. Yeah, it felt like we waited a while to get our food. But it was also incredibly fresh, so compromise. I understand we all have limited time for our lunches downtown, so when we go back we may call ahead to have an order ready for dining in."}
{"text":"Got to admit I was a little disappointed when the fast casual Mexican food restaurant closed not because it was great food, but the location was easy and convenient!  The Counter did a great job renovating the space and a big improvement to the quality of food.  Got the turkey burger with a few items thrown on it and everything tasted great.  Lorenzo, the bar tender who assisted me was great; refilled my ice tea, gave me a to go cup before leaving and brought my check in a timely fashion.  A few observations: for the price I paid for the burger I would have thought a small side would have come with it and since it did not I feel it is a slightly high price for a burger. I also noticed there was no one greeting people at the door therefore no one to seat you and the energy was a little low in the restaurant.  Those are minor issues, but it seems like a place that should be upbeat especially at the prices they are charging."}
{"text":"What a fun place to bring the whole family downtown. You get to create your own custom burgers. Service is very friendly and the resturants is very clean. They offer gluten free buns. We will be back."}
{"text":"Staying across the street and needed a basic dinner. Turns out this was a real pleasant surprise. First, the service was great and the waiter extremely nice. No up sell pressure... very relaxing   Made my burger and it was cooked to perfection. I really enjoyed it.   Finally,  it is an incredible value. A great and affordable meal. If you ate downtown,  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. The rest was awful. The burgers, the options, and the quality were top notch. Even so, none in our party will ever go back. The staff was unorganized, unprofessional, and downright rude at times. Half our table was finished before the other half got their food. We would have ordered more drinks, but we were never checked on again. They never brought out two sides that were ordered. Our bill was wrong, and the manager made us feel as if we were an imposition, and that she was doing us a favor trying to make it right. They weren't understaffed, as far as I could tell, and we weren't rude to them. Really not sure what was going on. We wanted a fun night of drinks and food with friends. Instead of starting off our evening on a good note, The Counter actually exhausted and frustrated us to the point that we all went home. Believe me, it takes a hell of a bad experience for me to call it quits so early on a Saturday night. Take my advice and skip this place. I wish I would have."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and it was so good! One of the best burgers I have ever had! We got the Parmesan garlic fries for an appetizer and they were amazing! When you go here you have to get them and ask for a side of garlic aioli to dip it in! When you choose the burger you can choose one of their burgers or you can build your own which I did. The burger was so good and exactly how I wanted. The bun was also amazing. Then for dessert I got a Nutella salted pretzel milkshake which you can tell by the name is so good. This place has a New York style to it. I definitely recommend coming here and next time I am in downtown Phoenix I am going to eat here."}
