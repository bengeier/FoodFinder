{"text":"Great food and at great price.  I especially like the Tortas Milanesa de Res and the Horchata.  They also have a little bakery inside the store."}
{"text":"There are many tortas paquime in the valley which are all great, but this one is the location. The sweet bread is always fresh and the tortas are always hot. If hungry for a torta or ice cream this is a must."}
{"text":"Real food, great value. This is one of the places that remembers its heritage and yet caters to modern tastes. Go wild on the menu, try something you do not already know about, especially the Aguas Frescas - fresh fruit drinks to die for. Also, head over to the far wall and pick out some pastries you wish your nana made. Great service, even better food. Get something to go or stay for awhile, your mouth will thank you."}
{"text":"disappointment....I was actually driving down McDowell Road looking for a Honduran place that I had heard good things about, saw this place, and decided to give it a go.  I wish I had kept driving.  I am a big fan of tortas, however, and could not resist temptation.  I ordered the torta de aguacate, which is basically an avacado sandwich with mayo/crema.  There are jalapenos and a tomato on it as well. No lettuce.  The bulk of the taste is the mayo/crema, which was so overpowering that I could not finish my meal.  I ordered to go, so I tried to mask the taste at home, adding various ingredients in attempt to improve the flavor by killing the crema.  Morningstar chicken and delicious New Mexican salsa could not save the sandwich unfortunately.  

The place was clean and the bread would have been good without the mayo.  I suspect that the meat tortas are better than the vegetarian one, so others may have a better experience than I.  The elote sounded interesting, roasted corn on the cob with cheese, lime, and chili.  It had the mayo on it too though.  I will not be going back to try it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Tortas. Everything I have had there has been excellent. So far my favorite is the torta ahogada which is in a pool of tomato and Chile sauce.  That is alone is worth coming to it check out. They also seem to use a large amount of fresh avocado in their tortas (literally they cut them there fresh and on the spot) 

Also they sometimes give you samples of the soups, and let me tell you they have some great ones. I'm not sure what this soup was called but it was a corn cream based style, and was literally one of the best soups I have ever tasted. They also have a fantastic Mango aqua fresca which is out of this world. I don't write many reviews on yelp as much as I use it for a resource, but this place I did because I really enjoy it. The service has also always been excellent. 

 I can't speak for any other items on the menu other then the tortas, soups, and the mango fresca so take this review based on those."}
{"text":"Well, I can't believe that there are 2 really good authentic Little restaurants in the same damn strip mall! This is the best Mexican food your gonna get in Phoenix! I guarantee it! Right here in Avondale. And if you want really good Thai food, about 100 feet around the corner. I love yelp! I've lived in Cali for years and I know good Mexican food. I grew up in Chicago and I know good thai food. You can't go wrong with either one of these. And for the price? It's ridiculous."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new and I found this place. The food was fantastic and I can't wait to go back to try something new from their very large menu. The staff was very friendly and the place was very clean. Their homemade horchata is mouthwatering. 
I recommend Tortas Paquime to anyone looking for a great place to eat and I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"I had the best Carne asada torta here!!! The bread is what makes it the best, it's not your average bread that you find at frys or food city. They also sell dessert or snacks for after eating. I tried the Paquihuates, which were awesome as well!"}
{"text":"The best tacos in the west valley. Try the ribeye"}
{"text":"Great food! The pork sirloin tortas are my favorite. I've gone back for them again and again. Generous size too! Their french fries are fresh, hot and crispy, golden brown, some of the best in town. Great place to stop for a quick lunch. Always busy, never overcrowded.

Also, the horchatas are delicious! They also have pastries, a large selection of home made fruit popsicles, and an amazing display of ice cream."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and service is better than a lot of other restuarants.  The restuarant itself is very clean and I like the open kitchen."}
{"text":"Any good sandwich starts with the bread. The torta roll was soft, sweet, and lightly toasted.  They used a sweet mayo which I normally don't like, but it worked so nicely with the meat.  I got pork...Mmmmmmmm!  It was tender and tasty!  The thing that made this torta so delicious, was the avocado.  They generously covered the roll with soft perfectly ripe avocado...and it was warm. They also put a little pickled jalapeño which added a nice tang.  I could have used a little more heat.  If I lived out here, this place would be a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Rib eye tacos are Amazing! Carne Asada fries  always made fresh! Good sauces. Only issue so far was Carnita tacos were a little dry but still flavorful. Also, because they make it fresh usually a little wait. Good fish tacos too and portions are nice!"}
{"text":"Well worth a visit.  Clean, fairly priced, good tortas served with a handful of potato chips.  Great stop for a quick meal if on the way to Sky Harbor.  Deserts are not cheap but quite good.  Go to Carolina's from the airport if 
arriving early to Phoenix and here if leaving late!"}
{"text":"Ricas tortas y aguas. Aunque les pongan menos aguacate y menos cane que antes. Los nachos de carne asada muy grandes y ricos. Y el pan dulce igual de delicioso. Ojala pronto abran una locación en Mesa."}
{"text":"My daughter likes to get the corn in the cup. It taste real good with some chili. The tortas are a hit as well as the jugos. I like the cantalope melon drink, its like a sweet milky melon. They offer a lot of favorites and sweets!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met for lunch a few weeks ago. I was not sure what to get but I ended up ordering a burrito combo. It was good and I also liked how they gave samples of their soup out. Tortas Paquime seemed to have a little bit of everything in their shop and it was very clean as well."}
{"text":"This place is a little fat Mexican girl's dream come true! They have yummy ribeye tacos, nachos, fresas con cream, paletas, pan dulce, thirst quenching agua frescas, even their darn soups are the bomb! Whether I'm stressed, bored, or need a treat...this place and its huge selection always deliver.
Only con, place gets packed so you have to run to get an open table and clean it too; since staff is uber busy. :-/

Dress: come as you are!"}
{"text":"Tortas are not the only Mexican fare served up here but are the reason I return! I tend to keep it safe with the ham and cheese torta (part sub/panini). The bread is so airy and has the right amountof sweetnes to make you just forget about the ham and just nosh on the bread. They bake it daily and bread is not for individual sale. Boo! Their fruit drinks are yummy; dining area just got expanded with a side bakery. TV's are kinda loud; needs more ventilation; parking is limited and next to tire shop but well worth the visit. Oh yeah; it's in the da hood too! But so far so safely good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch there. 

She had the Torta Paquime and it was really good. The pork and avocado were the stars of this simple tasty sandwich.

I had the Torta Ahogada with spicy red chile sauce. It was really good and super nice flavors."}
{"text":"I am here from Los Angeles CA, I came here to paint at the Paint PHX art event... This is by far the best place we have eaten at since we been here! Real Mexican Good Food!
Stan \"Saints\" Nuñez"}
{"text":"I happened on this place two years ago when in town to enjoy spring training. I live in Chicago, and there are some wicked good Mexican joints in town, but Tortas Paquime is right up there with the best casual Mexican in Chicago. Food is fresh, people are nice, and the variety of menu offerings are uniformly superb. The place is clean as a whistle, too (not always the case in Chicago). I am headed back to Glendale next week and can't wait to get back to Tortas Paquime. If they had one here in Chicago, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Very good customer service, friendly staff. Offered samples when we were unsure what to order. Food tasted great, good serving sizes."}
{"text":"Great local fast casual authentic Tortas!  The best I've had.  The absolute best tostada I've ever had as well.  Excellent desserts, pastries, gelato, breads made in house.  Great food all around."}
{"text":"Not the best location, but great food.  Love going here for lunch. Not all the employees speak english, so they have trouble with special orders, but it's not a big deal. Food is always delicious. Service is good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is great and the employees have great customer service!! I recommend they're tortas, tostadas and agua de fruta (fruit water)!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since they opened. Since they brought the torta paquime like the ones from casas grandes. But now they keep changing menu, charging more and the product is not of the same quality. They have lost flavor hardly any avocado in it anymore the bread not the same either. I was there last night and ordered carne asada torts and they use yo be good. Last night I receive a torts with 70% fat no meat one slice of avocado and the fee pieces of meat had no flavor. I think the owner needs to do some quality control so dissapointed. On a good note the place is always super clean."}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious. Quick and easy to get too. Must try. Oh the tacos, burritos, tortas all are amazing"}
{"text":"Love this place!! A little of everything!! Lunch, Dinner, desserts, snacks, pan dulce, aguas, and it's cleaner than most places that offer that much!"}
{"text":"I really recommend this place really good food always got really good customer service and everybody's always with a big smile when you walk through the door"}
{"text":"So I have to have real Mexican food when I come to Arizona and had to try this joint. I always ask if a Mexican place has cotija cheese and if they answer in the affimative, then I know they at least have the potential of being authentic. So I get the torta ahogada, pork. Super tasty pork with avocado, cotija cheese (I asked them for it) with a spicy red sauce covering it and drizzled with cream. All of my friends loved it as it was delicious. Also, the counter guy taking our order was so helpful and friendly and BAM got our order spot on. He could tell we had never been there before and kept offering us samples of the ice cream, horchata (SO GOOD) and soup.
I wish I had tried their paletas, they looked delicious but we were all happy with what we got. I wish I lived here so I could eat there again. Yum."}
{"text":"Good strawberries and drinks .
Dont care for the food or service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and team. Had the chicken salad and ribeye taco which were both delicious along with the mango/strawberry drink. I could have that drink every day. Salsa was good but could have been a bit more spicy. Would definitely recommend it for a quick local flavorful bite to eat."}
{"text":"Wow this placed surprised me ! I loved the carne asada torta  and the strawberries and  creme dessert was deliciousssssss! Oh and  the customer service is on point!"}
{"text":"Seriously excellent authentic Mexican food! I had their original Torta and it was delicious. The Horchata was top notch and I got a huge scoop of  Pecan Ice Cream for dessert which was DELICIOUS.

I highly recommend this place for it's excellent staff, great prices and outstanding food!"}
{"text":"Not the cheapest but pretty good nonetheless. They have a few dessert choices as well. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"As the name suggest, This mexican restaurant is known for its tortas. I like this place. The torta i  always get is the cubana. Layers of puller pork with different types of ham and healthy portion of sliced avocano to top it all off. I would give this joint a 4 stars but the only reason why i didnt is beacuse most of the tortas doesnt come combo. You will have to order a drink and fries seperate. Oh yeah the fries are the bomb here as well"}
{"text":"Found on Yelp.  Great variety, reasonable price, good service.  A little confusing for 1st. time patron, but lots of regulars observed.  Will be back."}
{"text":"So after seeing this place get over 4 stars I had to try it. It was bomb! I got the number 1 combo, pork sirloin with avocado, tomatoes, lettuce, chilies, home fries and a drink. My friend got the same thing but it was chicken, very good as well. I got the melon drink and fell in love. They have a case full of Mexican pastries, we tried the cheesecake, so good. This isn't a sit place, but don't let that keep you from coming in! Service was fast and friendly and the place was clean. Don't wait as long as I did, you will regret it."}
{"text":"Great authentic place for Mexican food in the west valley. I am so glad I tried it!! I had the original torta paquime. Everything on the menu looked super good, hopefully I will get to try some other stuff in the future!

The best part about this place is the variety of food options that they have: you can get a full meal, but if you are just looking for a snack they have a bunch of different Mexican breads and buns. Also, they have about ten flavors of ice cream and a lot of different desserts on their menu...so you can also just go for dessert!! I will definitely be back just to get an ice cream cone sometime...their flavors look delicious and freshly made. 

The service is really good too...even though it isn't a sit down and order type of restaurant with servers and stuff...the guy at the cash register came around to ask how our food was!"}
{"text":"Horrible don't go here!!! Went in for my first time and walking up to the counter the lady gave me a ugly look my fries were hard as a rock they were like 6 days old! The az torta is really small overall I got charged almost $20 for one small torta 3 tacos and expired fries I highly recommend you to never go here please it'll help you!"}
{"text":"Solid torta ahogada.  Showed up on a week day around noon, very few customers but they still took a very long time to get the food.  Might have made a 4 star....maybe."}
{"text":"food is ok.Customer service is terrible.Lady at the register should be fired unless she owns the place.Go to the one in east Phoenix.Better food and better service."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to have tortas. I usually get the Milanesa de Pollo torta, its chicken breast that is lightly breaded. They also have a great selection of \"pan dulce\" aka Mexican pastries. The Paquitostitos are also great if you are feeling adventourus."}
{"text":"I love this place ! I always get a torta and an amazing delicious AGUA De MELON !!!! Delishhh !!"}
{"text":"This place was/IS disappointing. Bought some tacos and as soon as I bit into it I spit it right back out! Possibly the worst tasting food I've ever bought. Will not be coming back, trust me there are like 3 better Mexican food places near this one."}
{"text":"Really good tortas, they use high quality ingredients. Friendly staff, family atmosphere, lots of food for a decent price. Que Rico!"}
{"text":"The tortas are amazingly delicious, but my favorite thing to eat there are the chicken flautas ajogadas."}
{"text":"Super good. Good ingredients. Great peppers, sauces, and pickled  onions for toppings. Fun atmosphere. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Looking for place to grab dinner to take home. Saw this on Yelp. Looks nice inside, nice seating area with pastry and ice cream in glass presentations cabinets. Went to order. Young lady barely could speak English, and was so soft spoken she could barely be heard in the noisy place even though we asked her to speak up. After leaning toward her several times she still didn't get the message. Older lady came and helped her split my flautas order into two chicken and two beef. Ordered the steak tacos, a sandwich for wife, and bean and 3 cheese burritos for the kids. Took 20 minutes to get order although few ahead of us. Drove 10 min home. They missed one burrito in our order. Food was quite cold and frankly not that great. Burritos nothing special and steak tacos fairly tasteless with fatty meat. Chips that came with meals were ok, and salad ok. May go back for ice cream or pastries but not food. I like to support local restaurants but not this one."}
{"text":"The place is clean. Costumer service was fine. But my food was insipid, I got a chicken torta, it was too small and the fries that come with it had not flavor as well."}
{"text":"Tortas Paquime is the ONLY place I will visit just to order the flautas ahogadas. Hands down are the best flautas ever."}
{"text":"I am updating the below review after eating there tonight and being mortified in finding out they have changed their beans as of last week to include meat which means there are now no good vegan protein options! The chips, salsa, and veg tacos ate still good but there is no well rounded meal option left and we will have to give up what was one of our favorite places to eat. Bummed!
My old review for reference.....
This place has such good food and as a vegetarian/vegan family we love the amazing flavors. The guacamole and salsas are top tier. Today we tried the new vegetarian tacos, 2 on jicama and two on corn tortillas, and we were elated! And the fresh fruit drinks and frozen treats are always delicious. The staff is so welcoming and helpful - you can tell they really have a great family team feeling and it is contagious. And to top it off we love how clean the restaurant always is."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Mexican food I've tasted (and I grew up in San Diego, minutes from the Mexico border).  I'm still dreaming about the Tacos de Ribeye, quesadilla with chicken, and Arroz con Leche.  Everything we tried was flavorful and value-priced."}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada torta with extra meat and an horchata to drink. The torta had good flavor...but I paid $1.25 more for extra meat and got extra grizzle instead (see my pic). I won't be back."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian tortas is my favorite! It comes with this really great salsa on the side, home made chips and there's plenty of avocado to go around! The Paquime combo is also a popular choice!"}
{"text":"They have the best Mexican food and their bread is really good, love their cheesecake"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it never gets old. Tortas are on point. You can't go wrong. Priced really nice too. Every time I'm in Glendale I swing by there."}
{"text":"By far the best tasting tortas hands down, authentic mexican taste GUARANTEED! ..........................

{"text":"I do like a good torta. Currently, in my book the king of tortas in Phoenix is Gallo Blanco. However, sometimes I don't want such a fine dining experience. There are days when I want quick and cheap; and when I want a quick, cheap, and good torta, there's one place that has not let me down: Tortas Paquimé.

As a biographical aside, I actually visited Paquimé, in the Mexican state of Chihuahua back in the spring of 1995. My first torta was prepared by a Tarahumaran Indian over a wood fire at Copper Canyon nearby there.  But I digress...

A buddy of mine who is originally from Ciudad Chihuahua turned me on to Tortas Paquimé when I asked him what he thought was a good, authentic torta place in the Valley. He noted, and I must agree, that the fact that they bake their own bread on-site makes all the difference.  I've had a few of their numerous tortas, and have not had a bad one.  Nor have I heard any of my co-workers who have accompanied me there complain.

The place is spotlessly clean. In fact, the cleanliness and order there is a little jarring at first visit. The staff is very nice, and completely bilingual. And the tortas are not only good, but they are also pretty cheap. All in all, this is delicious food at a great value in a clean, friendly place."}
{"text":"I don't say this about just any place I've been unimpressed with, but I actually regret having gone to Tortas Paquime. My to-go order included the torta ahogada and the soup of the day. It takes about 10 minutes, even when not busy, to receive the order. Finally, upon receiving my order, I grab the bag, which is located about a foot to the side of what appears to be a separate order of soup, inspect the bag to make sure I have everything. Seeing a large container in the bag, I grab and head out the door. 
Well, the torta is completely underwhelming. But, what really gets my goat is that the soup was actually the sauce. That soup located impossibly far from my order, was actually mine. And the person who had set the order on the counter and was standing there at the moment, the person whom I thanked for the order, said nothing.
Regrets."}
{"text":"After several returns I have to say I'm definitely impressed! They are fully staffed and the customer service has improved. Everyone including the chef said thank you after I picked up my order today! I really like this place because the food is consistent and the portions are great for what you pay.The place is clean and everything on the menu is Delish! This is your best option if you are closer to Avondale to get fresh pan dulce, gelato, antojitos, and dinner for the fam. There is something for everyone and the food has always had me come back. I'm a sucker for service so I'm extremely happy they were great and offered to let me sample the aguas frescas. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite.  Carnitas tacos were delicious and Mexican bread was soft and fresh.  Very nice people."}
{"text":"The restaurant is big and you have the option to sit out too. They have other treats like ice cream, Tostitos, pan dulce etc. The food is ok but I feel like not really worth the prices point they have. When you get a torta sometimes it comes with a tiny bag of chips. The agua de Melón is amazing tho!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great layout! Lots of authentic food from start to finish. The tacos were fantastic as was their corn and green chili soup! The staff was friendly and helpful. They offer flavored frescas (I had strawberry mango) which is basically fresh fruit flavored water which was delicious! They have a wide array of desserts as well which we didn't have a chance to try because we were so full but next Time!"}
{"text":"I'll start this review off with a little quote from my friend.
\"Romero's and Filiberto's are for drunk-white people. That isn't real Mexican food.\"

Well... he wasn't joking! 
We started off just heading out for some lunch, and he decided that he wanted to take the whitest girl he knew for some real Mexican food... where only real Mexican food can be found, apparently... In Maryvale.
We got there, and I was blown away by how delicious everything looked. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to order my own food because I am hardly fluent in Spanish. 
Regardless, we both enjoyed the Mexicana, which consists of lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, avocado, onions, mushrooms, beans, cheese, and steak, all in between two delicious pieces freshly baked fbread. 

We finished our meal with the Strawberries and Cream which was also unbelievable. This sounds like it would be just-another-thing, but the cream is flavored with something and its amazing.
Also, the Horchata is incredible! This isn't your watered-down Filiberto's crap. 


TL;DR: Try everything, you will NOT be disappointed. This place will kick any other so-called Mexican restaurant's ass.
It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Did they change owners or recipes? This place has been a long time staple for our office lunches for about four years now. It's usually exceptional but the last two visits we were surprised that the food was not as good. The chicken quesadilla which is usually excellent did not have grilled chicken as usual. It was sliced from what tasted like a roast chicken. The avocado was blackened and you now have to ask for the avocado crema which used to be included. Even the salsa tastes different. Bring the tried and true back an we will return :("}
{"text":"Okay I'll start with why it lost a star. I got a vegetarian torta and all it was, was avocado and a slice of tomato in bread. Nott what I was expecting and very plain. I didn't even end up eating it. But I have to say I probably ordered the most wrong item to order here.

On to the Good! This place was darling. I didn't have high expectations from the outside and was curious about the 4 star rating. The inside was impressive. It was extremely clean, festive, and had a huge variety. The bathrooms were extremely clean as well.

I ordered a corn cup and it was delicious. A little too much lime for my tasting but hit the spot nonetheless. This is definitely somewhere that I will check out again next time I'm in the area but order something else. Oh and I will DEFINITELY get some dessert... they looked soooo good.

It was nice that the restaurant was open and serving all portions of the menu, even at 10:30 am."}
{"text":"Los mejores esquites en Phoenix, pan y comida Mexicana autentica. Todo lo que he probado hasta ahorita ha estado rico y las sopas estan super buenas tambien."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were good, I'm a big fan of Tortas and it's impeccably clean- huge plus. The major downfall was a young cashier who over charged us on dessert. We both ordered a single scoop of ice cream following dinner and were clearly charged for the double-  a difference of $4 when you add the two- when I politely pointed out that the price seemed off the cashier looked at me and said, \"it's the taxes.\"  Now I'm pretty  unsure about Arizona adding 100% taxes, but he was dead set and did not want to double check. I did the math on my phone, accounting for the 9.1% tax, and it was a far cry from what we were charged. I

The food was good but I urge you to double check your bill, even though it's a small amount, no one likes to be over charged and under served."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos. I recommend the homemade lemonade and their fruit drinks. I had the stake tacos. Wonderful flavor, and topnotch quality. Already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I came here to try it out because I was craving tortas I was a little disappointed the meat had no flavor I felt like it was a little dry for almost $10 I expected more."}
{"text":"YUM!  Found this great little place while looking at running boards for the pickup right next door.  Soooo glad we grabbed a bite!  Everything on the menu looked amazing and fresh!"}
{"text":"Torta Mexicana and Ribeye Tacos were fantastic. I then really outdid myself with a Limon Aqua Fresca and finished with a scoop of caramel ice cream. Was very clean and staff was very friendly.

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The tortas taste good, but they are overpriced for what they are. Their size is not on the big side. They serve the torta with 5-10 pieces of chips, which hardly counts as a side. 

The bathrooms did not have paper towels."}
{"text":"This place is great. We've been to plenty of places for tortas but this place is amazing.

Their portions aren't as big as other locations but the food is delicious. The Cubana with extra carne asada is to die for. The little sauce that they give with the food is simply amazing. They also have bread such as empanadas which are great as well. 

Def recommend if you are looking for good food."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of other options like sweet Mexico bread , fruit beverages, desserts ,  and hand made ice cream."}
{"text":"I think this place is just O.K. nothing to rave about, especially with the price tags on their over priced, unseasoned tortas."}
{"text":"Strawberries con crema, Different breads (cheesecake), polo asada & carne asada- ALL were very good!  The ice cream is also really great and the agua frescas.  Never had a bad experience here. Will return. Soon."}
{"text":"REALLY good food. Not giving more stars cause had to send dish back twice... But once they got it right, it was really yummy."}
{"text":"Amazing food ! I come here at least once a week. Sometimes the waits are long but it's worth it. The elotes are top notch!"}
{"text":"The tostilocos here are bomb It's all I ever get. I drive a good 45 minutes just to satisfy the craving."}
{"text":"Deplorable customer service, wilted vegetables, Dry meat. definitely not the restaurant for me."}
{"text":"food is great here no matter what you order it  speaks volumes when the actual food is better looking than the pictures."}
{"text":"Viva La Torta's!  You never knew you could find such yummy food in a strip mall!  We have done breakfast, lunch and dinner here and all of the above is great!  The price is fair and the food is fresh and hot.  The one thing keeping it from a 5-star is inconsistency.  I have ordered the same thing multiple times and although it is always great, it is also never the same.  Mostly it is cheese, sometimes it comes with and sometimes without.  I prefer to always have the cheese!"}
{"text":"We love this place and eat here about once a week! We always get the #1 combo with potato chips (love the chips). Love the pickled onions and avocado on the sandwiches.  Everything is made there. Their cupcakes are THE BOMB!"}
{"text":"This place is so popular in all the hoods Ive been to. They're doing something right. The food is great, tried something new tonight called the paquimestitos or something like that. But they really got a little bit of this and that from pastry breads to the jugos to the Tortas to the nachos. You gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Where to start. I love this food but now prefer my original location on 43rd Ave. I buy the entertainment coupon book every year and use it to buy the same torta paquime combo I like but today they wouldn't accept it. Don't advertise in a coupon book who's coupons your not going to accept! Tables were dirty and service was not great like the location on 43rd Ave.
Also we asked if they could wipe out tables.. They wiped other surrounding tables but ours. We waited a bit and asked  again. So the woman came to wipe it.. Didn't say anything to us. We said thank you, because we appreciated that she cleaned it, there was pozole on it. She stormed off not uttering a word. Just rude!"}
{"text":"So so yummy.  I had the tostadas con pollo on my first visit and was amazed at the huge portion I received.  It was just supposed to be a snack but it ended up being quite a lot of stuff piled onto a perfectly crispy little tostada.

The next time I went, I had the tacos de ribeye.  Really amazing little tacos, perfectly cooked meat, and great toppings.  It's hard to find stuff this good and this cheap that has consistency and cleanliness, freshness of ingredients, and great personality.  ESPECIALLY out in the suburbs."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised with this place! It's an interesting combination of cuisines. The fries were good, the soda was bubbly and refreshing, the salsa was fresh and flavorful (and unique), and the Torta Cubana was actually quite delicious! I'll be back, but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one you should visit outstanding food and great Melon water!"}
{"text":"uber eatsed this place. holy efffff!!!! amaze-balls......Do NOT sleep on this tasty joint! Chips and guac were outstanding along with the tacos...oh man...food coma here I come..want to.....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"}
{"text":"I loved the torta mexicana, it's so delicious.  I can't wait to go again for lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and friendly staff. They haven't disappoint me yet, I've had tortas, flautas and burritos and even the tostadas.  The place is always super clean, the only thing is that the portions are a bit too small for the price, but I guess they sell quality not quantity."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant which offers a variety of Mexican  street foods and snacks. This is a really clean restaurant and the staff is very friendly. They sell sandwiches, flautas, tortas, salads, and even have ice cream. The food is tasty however if you get a Torta make sure to ask for it on fresh instead of it being fried(makes it soggy) check out this place"}
{"text":"I went to Tortas Paquime for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised to find that their food is borderline authentic. I ordered the Tacos de Ribeye plate and the tacos were small, the meat was mostly fat, and the red and green salsas available were not spicy at all. 

My highlight of the trip was the agua de limon, it was delicious! It tasted just like the agua de limon I used to drink in Mexico at similar torta and taco establishments."}
{"text":"We come somewhat often. The tortas are good but but something about the potato chips just makes me want more! I think they are homemade.  The best for thing about this place is the cleaniness of the place. Always, always clean no matter how busy they are."}
{"text":"Im in the west valley and always have been so when im short on time and this is one of my go to places for lunch or simple dinner. 

Have not had a torta that was not good yet but my personal favorites are the hawaiian or the ribeye. They have agua fresca, mango is my go to but limon is pretty popular too. Last, the ice crean is fantastic also."}
{"text":"First time here , Excellent service with friendly employees.. Love their rib eye tacos :)"}
{"text":"Super yummy!!! Best bean burrito and ice cream in town!!!"}
{"text":"Since I'd been hearing many good comments about this place we decided to give it a try. Let me tell you, we don't regret it at all!!  Place is clean (even bathrooms), servers and cooks are very helpful and friendly.  We had the Flautas Ahogadas (rolled tacos drown in tomato sauce), Twin Burritos(red and green shredded beef) and a Chilindrina. All of the food was so good!!  We also had Mango and Horchata Aguas Frescas and they were the bomb!! 
Can't wait to come back for some dessert since we end up with no space for it after our dinner.
Restaurant didn't get 5 stars because is a bit over crowded, sitting area by kitchen was very hot and is not as big as it needs for all the clients they get. I think next time we'll take order to go. And I say next time because we're definitely coming back!! Overall was a good experience. I would recommend you try this place at least once. But I can assure you'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place has everything. Their torta selection is extensive. I had the Mexicana and it was made with everything delicious: steak, mushrooms, peppers, sautéed onions and lots of avocado. I want to try a paqueme next time. The limon agua fresca was also refreshing. 

If we didn't have to run to catch a Dodgers spring training game, I would have stayed to have one of their colorful pastries or enjoy a paleta. 

Definitely going back when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the valley hands down. Food is always fresh and authentic. Friendly staff and it's clean even though it's not in the best part of town. Their drinks and deserts are good too. I have to come here every time I'm in this part of town."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks will return, hope this chain takes off even more."}
{"text":"LOVE this place, the tortas are very good and a good value too.
The bread has this sorta sweet taste to it and really makes the torta pop!

Took my parents there when they visted and they hadn't had a \"Torta\" before and they really did enjoy something different!"}
{"text":"best taco in the west valley! super clean environment however the horchata and juices are hella sweet. But tacos and the avocado slices on top make up for it!"}
{"text":"I love tortas Paquime. I love the service the tortas are the best in Phoenix. I've had Los Reyes de la torta (their competitors) they don't come close. I had a torta ahogada it was delicious. This location is very clean and the employees actually seem to enjoy their job. I hope they stay in the area..."}
{"text":"THis place was so so, nothing great to go out of your way for. I ordered a breakfast burrito, my husband got a Torta and chicken and fries for the kids. The price was fair"}
{"text":"Carne Asada Tortas were good, overall I want to come back but the service is the only thing stopping me from doing so. Veronica had a short attitude and didn't answer my question about the food."}
{"text":"Their carne Asada tacos were awesome. Cool little spot off McDowell. Also had their homemade salsa and it was some of the best salsa I've had."}
{"text":"The place was empty around 8:30 but my dad and I decided to try it. I had the chicken torta which had lettuce and avocado and enjoyed eating it. What I assume to be fresh mango juice was good as well. Is it worth a 5 star rating? No. Would I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"I recently had their carnitas tacos combo and boy was it dry.  Definitely not getting this dish again.  I should've stuck with the ribeye tacos.  My mistake, and I'm warning you not to make that mistake I did.  I just hope it was an off day."}
{"text":"Love the torta light, hot or cold. The melon agua has pulp but still quite refreshing, for those who enjoy melon. Cute environment, only a few tables but I seem to snag one when I dine in. Parking lot can be hectic at certain times of day but that's everywhere....fresh chips are awesome!!"}
{"text":"The food here is authentic and delicious. I recommend the tacos, tortas, aguas frescas, and burritos. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Good Food and Good Prices. Not bad. I ate a torts Cubana and it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. My peer got some enchiladas and she loves them, so overall good small place."}
{"text":"Tortas are awesome...milanesa de pollo is my fave. It is lightly breaded chicken. ..similar to chicken fried steak. Fresas con crema are awesome here too! I gave them  4 stars because today I came in and ordered some corn on a cup and was very disappointed. I think they might have used mozzarella instead of cotija cheese. Huge mistake since the cheese melted and formed a ball which was impossible to break up. Also not sure what powdered chilli they used but it made the corn pink. Flavor I was looking for wasn't there.  Will def come again but will not be ordering the corn."}
{"text":"I was truly not impressed with this place. We went there because my husband and daughter said it was good. I ordered the pork carnitas tacos. Son and hubby ordered the ribeye steak tacos and my daughter ordered the tostada paquime   When they say these are street tacos they mean it. Very small with outrageous pricing and not that good of food. If you want small portions that cost alot then this is your place."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio y la comida d lo mejor tambien, recomendadisima !!!  los empleados siempre muy atentos"}
{"text":"We were visiting AZ and wanted to at least try one Mexican spot.  This is a small fast food restaurant.  There are a few tables and booths for dining in. They have dessert options and baked goods. 

The young lay at the order counter was very nice and friendly.  She offered us samples of the agua fresca.  I really like the fresh fruit juice.  Must get the strawberry/cantaloupe flavor.  So creamy and good. The salsa bar is basic with spicy roja or mild green verde.  

Since it was our first time, we decided:
****Carne asada tacos: good for now.  I did not care for these. 
***Carne asada burrito It's small slices of rib eye. The chips/salsa/guac is delicious.  Freshly made to order.

If in the area, may stop here. But it's a once a year thing.  So I will be back next year maybe or not."}
{"text":"I thought this place was going to be the typical cheap burrito joint but boy was I wrong. This place really does the food well. I love the prime rib tortas or the carne asada burrito. But more than the great food this place has mexican ice cream, a selection of pastries and even makes cakes. Also the place is very clean and lively. A big thumbs up in my book!"}
{"text":"This place does not dissapoint. It's not your typical taco joint. A unique fusion of Mexican and American, I mean you can get a rib eye torta with a side of fries, it's brilliant. Throw in a salsa bar with HOT jalepinios and smoky salsa, an ice cream booth and a selection of mexican bread/pastries and you have a sold 5 stars in my book. Grab your coworkers and head over for an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Overall, the best Mexican food chain restaurant in The Valley.  As far as torta places go, I would rank it in the top 4.  Most likely at #3 right now, right behind Los Reyes de la Torta.  The 2 tortas I have tried so far (the Mexicana and the Cubana) have both tasted great, and the Cubana really was distinct from the other chain 'Beto places in that every meat could be tasted distinctly and not as some meat mash.
However what truly sets tortas paquime apart is its aquas frescas and pan dulces.  Try the melon aqua.  It was almost reminicent of a creamsicle.  And the donas are drop dead.  
Overall, the ambiance,  cleanliness and friendliness of the staff help push tortas paquime into the upper echelon of pheonix mexican places ."}
{"text":"First time here and they have Great food! Loved the ribeye steak and chicken tacos. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time? Just get the ribeye tacos and call it a day. That's all you'll ever need. They have a neat veggie and salsa bar that will just add to the steaky goodness. Not in the mood for a meal? Their bakery selection is great. I was shocked at the cheap prices for the baked goods. Casual atmosphere with friendly staff. Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is a great place for a variety of Mexican dishes. Of course, you have the tortas, but they also have tacos and a bakery. They also have deserts including ice cream and popsicles. For the tortas, I would probably pass next time. I've had better. For the tacos, I highly recommend the ribeye tacos. Very tasty. 

The bakery has great bread and pastries and they are so CHEAP! Great price and great value for the bread. The other items are a little high, but still affordable. Overall, great place."}
{"text":"Really great tortas, and fries. Service was great and I definitely recommend this place if your looking for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this eatery. I enjoyed the most wonderful quesadilla. Will return if I'm back in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"The food is always good. The staff is friendly and the desserts are great!

We have been there half a dozen times, no bad experiences."}
{"text":"Food was really good. I had the Torta - Jamon con queso (ham and jack cheese) and a baby amount of chips come with it, so we got fries too! The jalapeño was a little spicy for me but it added to the overall flavor. Clean place, good parking, nice staff and only took about 10 minutes max to get our order in and start eating.  Getting here can take awhile if taking 35th Ave just FYI if you're going on your lunch break."}
{"text":"Two days left on a trip to the Phoenix area, and we found this awesome Mexican street food place not far from where we were staying. Absolutely amazing! The Torta sandwiches are delicious, large and filling. They also offer great Mexican baked goods, and great made Mexican style Ice Cream and Popsicles. But for me the real standout at Tortas Paquime are the drinks! The Horchatta is by far the best I have ever had, The melon is like drinking a liquefied cantaloupe, and they also offered a fruit drink that was equally as delicious! Had I found this place sooner it would have been a daily stop-off. Overall if you are looking for great Mexican street style grub or are sweating the Desert Heat, and need a cool refreshing drink this place should not be missed! Amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since they  opened about 6 years ago and it just keeps better.  Fresh made to order menu that is full of variety and taste!  The pastries are VERY reasonably priced however only 4 stars because the selection is not as fun and flavorful as before.  Not looking for more sugar pan just some of the more decorative, unique flavor pieces.  Maybe it was just because it was a Monday.  Overall this is a must hit!!!"}
{"text":"I had a sandwich from here some time ago during a meeting when the folks made a food run and I was asked what l wanted. Best I could muster up was, \"what ever is good\" I was brought the roasted turkey. Might i say, best Mexican sandwich EVER.  I mean it was so good. You just have to come and try it for your self. I was given a menu and immediately searched for a place near me and viola, I have been here a few times already. Tonight I will try the Cubana.  It's one of those places you'd never think of going to. First off, this place is clean, I mean clean. It's a nice little place, parking kinda sucks but the food rocks. That is all."}
{"text":"great food. a bit on the pricey side but def worth it once in a while."}
{"text":"The food is good and prices are ok. Their service is excellent. I love their agua de frutas it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Flavorful, one of my favorite restaurants for quick Mexican food. Typically I'm the only white girl I see in there ordering food. Some of the dishes are spicy, and if they aren't spicy enough for you, try the salsas for an extra boost."}
{"text":"Here for the billionth time. And for once they have shitty service. It's so frustrating. English please."}
{"text":"It's a good place if you want some real tasty Aguas frescas! There tortas are also tasty!"}
{"text":"I'd consider this place a good place to come as a last resort. Wouldn't be my first choice just because I always get a warm \"what do you want, hurry up and order \" look from ladies at the register . Good is good tho . Get the Fresas con crema! The cooks are always happy and do a great job"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!! EVERYTHING I HAVE HAD HERE is....DELICIOUS!!!!!! Super steak nacho Supreme is out of this world!!! Piñon Ice cream in the delicate crisp cone .... ADDICTIVE!!! Love this place!!!  Very fair price and leave happy and stuffed! Why diet ? Have some good fun at Tortas! Staff is always friendly too!"}
{"text":"My hunny and I traveled to Arizona for some Dodger Baseball and noticed this joint had good reviews. We beat the rush, right about 4:30, then there was a cried off people. I had been craving some tasty Mexican food. 

I ordered the Torta and my hunny ordered the flautas and choose and guac as a side. My torta was noting like I had before, it was wet! I wasn't sure how to expect how it would taste, but it was delicious! The meat was cut pretty think, but wasn't difficult to chew. The flavors worked great together: with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, cheese, and sour cream drizzled on top. Needless to say, it was gone almost as quickly as it was served. My hunny's flautas were more like taquitos covered with sauce, sour cream, lettuce and sliced avocados. The sauce was great, but I could have found these at Costco. 

I'd go again, probably get the torta, it was delightful."}
{"text":"I've been in the Phoenix area for eight months and FINALLY, FINALLY I have found Mexican food worthy of the cultural name.  Always a good sign when the friendly counter staff greet you in Spanish.  They make their own Michoacan style ice cream.  The Flautas Ahogadas with the spicy sauce are BOMB.com!!   I also had the chicken soup that reminded me of my Mother's.  \"Happy\"!!   The Milanesa torta was perfect.  My only complaint was that I got full and couldn't eat any more.  But I will be back tomorrow.  I'm a true Mexican/American and I love my heritage inspired foods.  Highly recommend this place.   10 STARS!!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth trying! 

After hearing friends rave about this restaurant, we decided to give it a try. It's a little hard to locate because there is no sign, but worth the search. 

We took a risk and had the torta ahogada. It was worth it. My boyfriend and I shared that torta and some tacos and were stuffed. The horchata was gritty :( but it could have been because we were there later in the night."}
{"text":"Their colita pavo changed my life. Deep friend turkey, avocado, great bread... Their tortas are a revelation--they have pickled onions, peppers, and salsa to pile on as well. The food is authentic. You can't leave without getting some of their cheap and tasty pan dulces either. I wouldn't get the elotes here though--you can get much better elsewhere (the one letdown here). Their amazing reputation is well-deserved."}
{"text":"The food is good (for what I've tried) but we visit often for the fresh Pan Dulce they have.  It's a small selection, as their batch for the day seems to be all they sell - which I'm okay with.  Pan dulce that's a day old doesn't taste good. 

What I question is their servers.  Keep a close eye on them handling your food.  The LAST time we bought ice cream there, the sweet young lady wearing long acrylics put on ONE glove to hold the waffle cone.  She proceeded to scoop the icecream with her other hand  (without a glove) and while trying to keep the sliding door open of the freezer w/her elbow, she tried very hard to multitask and scoop and scoop.  However, I noticed her nail touch the ice cream as soon as she placed it in the waffle cones.  She did this several times. I know she felt it, its ICE CREAM!  But they were so concerned of taking care of every customer in line that they work quickly.  They ring you up, prepare your order, hand it to you, and THEN they finalize your charge.  So customers behind you wait for them to prep whatever it is that you order.  My husband didn't let me ask for a refund or another ice cream (I'm sure they wouldve fixed the issue) but we just stepped outside and dumped the icecream in the trash.  

They usually have 2 - 3 people taking orders but there's only 2 registers on that side of their restaurant.  Everything tastes good but I always look closely when they're handling my food.  The same happens with pan dulce (sweet bread/pastries) when you pick your own bread with food tongs, place it on a tray and hand it over to them to charge you and bag/box it up.    They take it to the back (where you may or may not have visibility) for them to pack it up.  

In general, I know they mean well.  The place is clean.  Food, desserts, drinks and Pan dulce taste great!  You can tell by their service.  It's one of the few places you don't see their employees chitchatting because they're busy working.  

Parking is limited."}
{"text":"Never had a torta before. I had the shredded pork ones which were delicious. Great flavor. Add a little of the green salsa. Done."}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick stops in Phoenix! And they're everywhere which is great when you're craving some of their delicious ribeye tacos or a torta ahogada (pork sirloin torta soaked in chile & tomato sauce), something like a dipped Italian beef. They also have a full on ice cream and paleta menu, with tons of \"antojitos\" for your inner fat kid."}
{"text":"The food was delicious both times I ate at this restaurant but unfortunately I also got food poisoning both times. I ate there for dinner last night. I was up all night throwing up and rushing to the restroom. I had to leave work this morning. Disappointed to say I don't trust this place anymore.
Ramiro's on 107th and indianschool right next to brothers pizza is my go to spot. Never made me sick and the mini tacos are delicious."}
{"text":"First off, I have absolutely no issue with the food. I think it's very good, and I've been here several times so obviously I like it.

What I do have issue with, is the staff talking crap about my order in Spanish because they think I can't hear. They speak insults while preparing my food, making fun of what I ordered and how I wanted it prepared.  That's not cool.  They should not assume when people can and can't understand Spanish."}
{"text":"That spicy red sauce needs to be on everything. Flautas were just a vehicle to transport cheese and sauce into my mouth. They actually did a poor job so I grabbed a spoon. The turkey butt torta was pretty good. The meat itself was a little fatty and gelatinous. We finished off the meal with some ice cream which tasted like those little clear cups with the strawberry stripes along the side."}
{"text":"Clean and commercialized is how I would describe this place. IT lacks the authentic feel and ambiance I would expect.  But this is not why the score it low, it was the flavor to value ratio.

My avocado tomato and mayo torta was $5 and it was slightly larger than a .99 hamburger. It had a very creamy flavor from the avocado and tomato on the soft bun. Add to that some 1.99 french fries and I had a unfilling meal.

The one highlight of this place is the condiment station, with a great creamy and hot red salsa, avocado dip and fried peppers. 

If you rarely stay away from the big chains and want a torta this is for you, if you like the flavors and fell of local dining look on."}
{"text":"By far one of the best places to get a torta in Arizona. Def recommend trying it out, the staff is friendly and welcoming. There is also always fresh bread"}
{"text":"Great food and pan dulce.  I've been there a handful of times. Its always clean. The food comes out quickly and it's always delicious. The pan dulce is baked on the premises."}
{"text":"The torta ahogada is delicious!! I would recommend it to anyone! Excellent ice cream as well and good desserts."}
{"text":"Recently moved from California, I have been in search of a good Mexican cuisine and was flat out of luck. Until I found Tortas Paquime OMG! finally a place to eat good burros & tacos and if you are a fan of tortas like me you hit gold if you eat here. They have Ahogadas, Cubanas, Milanesa, Puerco, n ofcourse Asada.  They are also kid friendly with a good variety.  To top things they have desserts for days. To start they have Pan Dulce, Ice Cream, Paletas, and various mexican deserts like fresas con crema, Flan, Pastel 3 leches, Choco Flan, Escamocha, Mangoneadas, Esquimales. They also have really good Aguas Frescas."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on the recommendation of a friend. WOW! What a find! Lots of great choices on the menu & the food is delicious. Generous portions for a reasonable price. Nice place!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time coming to this place. The first time I had their carne asada tacos and it was about a year ago. It was ok. There happened to be a roach crawling in the restaurant but didn't make it a big deal nor loss my appetite. I went there last night and I ordered a carne asada torta. The torta was very small for the price (almost $7). It barely had any meat. I wasn't impressed for a place that specializes in \"tortas\". I hope they can improve their quality, if not, at least lower the price. A torta, 8 very small carne asada tacos, and two drinks total $28, it's a ripoff. I won't be coming here anymore.  Oh and the place is always dirty. The floors were sticky."}
{"text":"They've got a couple vegetarian menu items, which is good!     And overall a good variety of food.       I really enjoyed the Burrotote,  which is carne asada with beans and avocado in a burrito.      Very filling,  very satisfying and the ingredients seem good quality and fresh.   

They do a lot with avocado here,  if the menu is any indication - mmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place out for a few years since my mechanic is basically across the street. So I finally took the plunge and said to myself, \"What took you so long?\".

I thought it was a nice sized place with plenty of seating and a stand alone soda station, salsa bar and  a bunch of yummy looking desserts at the counter. They had the spanish language televison and music going on as well.

I ordered the 3 carnitas tacos on corn shells. They give you plenty of meat with a little dab of quacamole on the side and garnished with a few chopped onions, tomatoes and some cilantro for $6.89. Did I mentioned that they give you plenty of meat? Wow, the flavors really meshed well together. Needless to say, I really enjoyed my meal and am looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The service was not as great as the food I was in Avondale visiting my sister and stopped in for a bite! The place is great so is the food. The service not so great not to make it a racial event but I don't speak Spanish and I really felt it was the problem"}
{"text":"One word for this place! DELICIOUS! 

Of course you have to wash down your delicious Torta with a aqua fresca!!! I will be back for sure!!! Haven't tried the ice cream but it looked very good! We need one in Chandler or Casa Grande!"}
{"text":"Stopped by because of the positive reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed. The rib eye steak tacos were awesome. We also tried their ice cream, very good as well. We are from Las Vegas and will surely be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"This is a great little place.

They have almost as many dessert options as they have food, which is unusual in itself.  Check the website menu for a full list.

We had the rib-eye tacos and the Cubano torta.  Both very very tasty and a good value for the price, and both were very well-seasoned and yummy.  Big chunks of avocado on each taco, and a salsa bar with a lot of good options.

They also have....

chocolate covered strawberries for 75 cents each.

One of the best values on THAT product that you will find anywhere.

It was clean and shiny in there too, and open, and overall just a pleasant ambiance.

Definitely a spot I will return to, probably many times.  Highly recommended !!!"}
{"text":"Best tortas in the whole state of Arizona tortas paquime no hay otro lugar que ni se les acercan a estas tortas!!!! Y todo lo que venden está al 100%"}
{"text":"We go to paquime on Dunlap and central all the time so decided to try this place out! It was really good! They have many of the same menu items and they were just as delicious. We got the Mexicana torta, the twin burritos, and the papas nachos, all of which were great. I asked for jalapeños on the side of the nachos and that really made them! The meat in the torta was flavorful and tender. Their ice cream looked really good, so I will try that next time!"}
{"text":"At the recommendation of a co-worker, a group of us from work visited Tortas Paquime.  I'm not a Tortas aficionado, but I'm willing to try something new, especially something that I would likely not try or stop at on my own.

We park and go inside- there is a wait and it appears that the counter service is a little slow.  The place is new looking and very clean.  It is an open kitchen and you can watch the prep cooks prepare your food.  Everything looks great, it's hard to choose.  Fresh avocados abound, and we marvel as the cooks deftly remove the bright green flesh from their skins, adorning our food with these delicious fruits.

The counter help is friendly and helpful.  Our orders are taken and drinks provided.  They make REAL lemonade and fresh fruit drinks.  Bottled Mexican sodas, fresh brewed tea.  

Our party orders a variety of food- Tortas, tostadas, flautas, churros.

I ordered 2 tostadas and likely could have been fine with one.  My pork tostada is loaded sky high with beans, delicious pork, shredded lettuce, fresh avocado, and more.  My vegetarian (bean) tostada is equally delicious.  It was a crisp fresh salad on a tortilla.  My friends who ordered tortas were very pleased, and they know their tortas.

One problem we had was that they had TVs on and the volume was very high.  We asked if they could adjust and they said they could not.  It was loud enough that you had to raise your voice to talk.  Spanish speaking comedy, music, and gorgeous tourism video played.  

I would definitely bring my kids here, as I think they would enjoy the adventure. I'll definitely go again.  I also recommend this to folks who want to try something more authentic and varied, but also want familiar ingredients as an option.

{"text":"2nd time here and we leave happy n full.Great tortas, very authentic oh n the staff is always helpful. Love it, we'll def be back."}
{"text":"Tortas El Guero,you've been put on notice.  I think I've found a new place to satisfy my Torta needs.  My only complaint is that the milanesa is cut up so small that it is a difficult feat to get the stuff to stay in my perfectly baked bun."}
{"text":"Better then you might think.

Tortas Paquime is clean, busy and has great food. The entrée's at Torta Paquime are reasonably priced, made fresh to order, and absolutely delicious. 

The carnitas  and ribeye tacos are some of the best I've had anywhere and the tortas are not only delicious but are enormous as well. So be prepared to go hungry and have leftovers. Make sure you ask for a side of the pickled onions, jalapenos and carrots (they're free).  

You never walk away from Tortas Paquime hungry but leave some room for a dessert because the ice cream and pastries will satisfy your sweet tooth.

Great service and excellent food, it doesn't get any better."}

{"text":"This place is alright. Nothing extravagant. The salsa looks like buoy you putting kook aid on your food. Tastes meh. Their telera for their Tortas are THE saddest teleras I've ever seen. Didn't make the meal enjoyable at all. The girl at the register gave me mad attitude too when I ordered. It was my first time being their and she acted like I had been there since day 1 or something, hitting me with that \"You're total is X.\" LIKE BIH I AINT DONE, SHEESH. This place trash. Horchata meh."}
{"text":"Love Tortas Paquime - everything is made fresh to order with high quality ingredients. Restaurant and kitchen are spotless and the staff is very friendly. On top of all that they have ice cream by the scoop, paletas, and fresh made pastries. The tacos de pollo are my family's favorite, but the Tortas are yummy too. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"After a long drive from Las Vegas to glendale, this was our stop to eat and find a hotel to stay in. Reviews looked good so we gave it a shot. My 2 friends, originally from guadalajara,  said their tortas ahogada wasn't authentic. I had a torta Mexicana. Really liked my sandwich. Very flavorful. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Might haven given 5 stars if my friends thoroughly enjoyed their meals, but I'm sticking with 4  the prices are very reasonable and there is a wide variety of menu items. Something for everyone. Next time I'm in the neighborhood I would pop in and have another go at their menu."}
{"text":"Might be a little on the pricey side for Mexican food but the quality has consistently been there on my visits. Along with very nice bilingual cashiers. 

Huge menu but what I've tried so far has been great. One of the best horchata I've ever had too."}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible the cashier was being so rude forgot to charge us for the drinks that I clearly told her I wanted. Then she came back and told us that we need to pay for them if we want them. Well duh! I didn't expect free drinks because of your mistake. The food was  dry and flavorless I've heard so many good things about this restaurant and I came out really disappointed."}
{"text":"I am a little late writing this review.... I have recently moved back to Phoenix and was very excited to go back to this restaurant to get my torta fix. First they forgot my extra corn I ordered. I called to let them know it was missing and they didn't care and asked me what I wanted to do. 2nd the sandwich had American cheese ( advertised as cheddar) and practically no meat along with 5 chips. The torta was absolutely horrible. My boyfriend got a burrito which we couldn't even eat because the beans tasted so bad.  I am not sure what happened to this place. I have been here before and had a wonderful torta."}
{"text":"Have you ever bitten into a mango that is so deliciously sweet that you want to repeat the experience?  If you have then you'll want to stop by for a mango ice cream at Tortas Paquime.  Best mango ice cream you'll ever have.  Yes, the tortas are good and the quesadillas and the chilindrinas are too but I LOVE the ice cream at this place..  The mango ice cream is my favorite but all the other flavors are good also."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with \"Tacos de Ribeye\" 
Yummmmmmmm

Everything is fresh and tasty. Their tostadas, tortas and tacos are delicious. I love their fresh horchata. You gotta try their Nieves (ice cream) 

Salsa and guacamole sauce is the best, that's what makes the tacos so dam good. 
It's a bit pricey but well worth the $$$$$$ 

They even have pandulce which is very soft and fresh. 

They have several locations in the valley, and this particular one is my favorite. They play cool music too. 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Was craving a torta Tuesday night 7/3, and I knew that my fave was already closed by 830pm (Tortas El Guero). Also had my g/f that night, who'd never had one. She ordered the Paquime, and I had the Cubano w/o beans. I was highly disappointed. Those two sandwhiches are nowhere approaching the same league as my fave, or Tortas Del Rey. Tiny, thin, and so-so on the taste. 

My g/f loved hers, and kept wondering why I was disappointed. On July 4th, I called and found T El G was open, and I promptly took her there. Then, and only then, with close comparison, could she understand the vast chasm of difference between a true TORTA, and those two jokers we had the night before. 

NOW, I want to be clear I'm only disappointd in their sandwhiches. The place is large, clean, friendly and OPEN late. I saw a salad and a plate dish or two coming out of that kitchen for which I WILL RETURN to sample.It's just that when I want a REAL -DEAL TORTA, it won't be there."}
{"text":"If your in the neighborhood, definitely worth the stop. Large , nice looking shop that serves excellent tortas,  baked goods, drinks and desserts. In my opinion several steps above your typical torta shop. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"On our long drive from El Paso TX to Los Angeles- went a little out of our way and it was worth it. My torta - ham and cheese was the best I have ever had so fresh and tasty. Also took pan dulce for home - super yummy."}
{"text":"Great place to eat when your tired of all other mexican food places. The twin burritos are the best! Just a little pricey but worth the money."}
{"text":"Our new found love! Amazing staff, clean, and prefect cuisine! Even if you have to drive from a far, it's a must try!"}
{"text":"I never find myself dinning in this neck of the woods but I wanted to meet a girlfriend for lunch and she works at the juvenile court nearby.  Our options looked bleak until I hopped onto my Yelp app and found this gem.  

I was taken back by how clean and shiny everything was.  The display of pan dulce, agua frescas and ice creams made my mouth water when I walked inside.  
Tortas Paquime is great for a quick bite.  I had the paquitostitos and my friend had taquitos - yummy snacks on the menu.  

Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Es una tristeza que este lugar ya no se lo mismo en calidad de comida como ase unos años atrás .... Los precios en los tacos es de macizado caro por una tortilla sola y chica también la milanesa de pollo y de carne fueron un dolor de estomago se nota que usan el mismo aceite de cocina en toda la comida por el sabor de cochambre en la carne y pollo ... Qué lástima no poder dar una buena nota ..."}
{"text":"I postponed writing my review of Tortas Paquime I July since it was my first visit and our experience was 2.5 stars.  Today's visit brought them up to a 3 star rating. 

The Good ~ They use very fresh ingredients, their tortas and variety of postres are very good.  They offer a soup of the day.  The service is friendly and they are fairly quick to make your order.  Their prices are very reasonable and cheaper than most other places that offer the same menu options.  

The not so Good ~ Their Aguas Frescas are not made fresh to order and tasted very watered down.  The tortas are very good however their Tacos Volteados was more of a melted cheesy tacos than a shredded pork tacos.  They were also a too greasy.  

The Bad ~ We had to sit on the side of the restaurant that has the TV and it was too loud.  It was playing some kind of Mexican comedy that was not appropriate for the children to watch that were dinning at the time.  It was also very hot in in the restaurant.  I will blame that on the Arizona heat."}
{"text":"Carne asada torta and mango ice cream 4 stars"}
{"text":"Food is good, pasties are alright but I go here for the ice cream. It is da bomb. If you go, I would recommend the pistachio for sure and also the chocolate chip. I don't even like pistachio but man is it yummy. I think I will buy the whole tub for my birthday. Yep, that's happening."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to try this! 

This is no typical torta joint!  This place has a plethora (do I get extra points for using this word?) of tastiness on the menu!  Tortas, tacos, ice cream, all these other dessert choices...AND....a little bakery! 

All of their agua frescas are amazingly tasty...not too sweet at all!  I had agua limon and I wanted more!  

Very clean and very friendly service!  Great little salsa bar and just yummy all around!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the amount of food portions seem small.   My favorite is the carne asada torta."}
{"text":"This place is really, really good...just like their other location we've tried.  It seemed a bit bigger and busier though.  Got two tortas this time - ahogada and Mexicans, both were very good and was way more than we could eat.  Also got ribeye tacos, which are absolutely the best.  Even though this place was great, they have another \"Street Foods of Mexico\" location on Dunlap that is a bit more homey and is still my favorite place for street tacos in Phx."}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic Mexican aguas and tortas this is the place for you.
The skinny 
I have been coming here for about a year now and they have kept up with the quality waters I have tried the horchata melon limon naranja and piña. All are great my favorite is the agua de Fruta the large drink is 2.70 and is worth every drop ask for no ice and get more :-). The tortas are ok seems pretty average comparing them to other torta places or even filibertos the carne asada is on point and they have daily specials like a torta fries and drink for 5.99 plus tax. They also have a panederia (bakery) with fresh Mexican donuts and breads decent prices you might get same quality at ranch market for cheaper but it's great they offer it. 
The bad 
The front counter is so close to the door I sometimes get confused about the line and it makes for unnecessary confrontations between patrons. While I do speak Spanish I did hear a lady having the hardest time ordering in English until I stepped in to help no big deal but I think they could have handled situation better. 
Overall 
This place is as authentic as the places I go to Mexico especially the waters they are great cooks, quick and affordable"}
{"text":"Was not as great as everyone had been saying. It was mediocre food. Have not been back since but it seems really popular for its desserts. The desserts did not interest me...too much going on for me...a lot of ingredients looked more like a piece of art, but cool to look at. :)"}
{"text":"The food was closer to a 3 star rating but the friendliness of the staff, the immaculate kitchen and the relatively fast service bumps it up to a 4.  We tried the torta Paquime and the torta Mexicana.  Both were good but the Mexicana was better.  Saw someone else get what I call taquitos and a huge order of nachos, after we were already eating.  Those both made my mouth water and wish I had 2 stomachs.  Worth stopping in..."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent,I usually have the Big carne asada burrototi,always great,the ice cream,breads and horchata is right on.Ive never been disapointed here at all..highly recommended."}
{"text":"I didn't agree with the 4+ stars reviews that were written about this place. Service was horrible, and they are not generous at all with either service or portions... sad day... 

We were on our way home from AZ to CA. I ordered a Pozole, which was slightly over spicy/hot than most I've had... since the chips that usually comes with it was out, they gave me me bread instead.. that was not what I wanted to eat with the pozole.. 
The food menu is too overprices, and they aren't too generous with their portions.. I know this because the rest of my group ordered tacos and sopes.. 

Thank goodness the horchata was decent. Since my order wasn't the best.. 
There isn't much seating inside, it's quite spacious, but there are only a few tables and chairs... probably max 30 people.?  

Ok, one nice thing that I liked, though I didn't get a chance to eat it, was the pan dulce. There was a large display of various pan dulce. I almost opted to each these breads rather than finish the rest of my pozole... 

*sigh* disappointed.."}
{"text":"i had heard about this place so I decided to stop by friday after work. I ordered 2 tortas ahogadas to go for my dad and myself. When I got home I realized they had given me the wrong order. I called in and manager was kind enough to tell me if I went back I would get the right order for free. I went back yesterday after work and I did get the right ordere. My torta ahogadas are very delish. The sausce is very tasty. The whole torta was very good. I would would go back again."}
{"text":"Shout out to my friend Erica for introducing me to this place! I haven't tried much from here because once I find something I like, I tend to STICK to it! My recommendations would be the Chicken tacos lil combo or HIGHLY RECOMMENDED the chicken flautas ahogadas!! My favorite from here! I only eat chicken so that's all I can suggest and have tried like mentioned before lol 

My friend loves the tortas!

A good stop for lunch AND dessert with the various treats they offer! I've only had a watermelon paleta... so other than that I can't say. But they look yummy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place and have been coming for years. The Torta Paquime is the best and they had really solid agua frescas. Every now and then they have pretty good soup too! The interior of the restuarant is really nice and welt kept. Always clean and tables wiped down."}
{"text":"I pass by this corner about once a week right about lunch time and while there are several interesting looking options on the Southwest corner they are hard to get in to traveling West.  I will on occasion stop at the Burger King on the Northwest corner.  A discount coupon popped up last week for this place and while I did not buy the coupon I took note of where it was and went looking for it today.

The address places it on Indian School when in fact it is unit 1 in a meandering strip mall and it actually faces 43rd Ave.  Parking right in front is crowded so it is better to park in the big open area by Payless shoes and walk up.

Getting there just after 11 the place was almost full and there was a steady stream of customers the whole time I was there.

I got the Mexicana torta which had grilled steak, onions, bell pepper along with cheese and a generous amount of avocado. I also had the soup of the day which was mostly shredded, seasoned chicken in a broth.  Both were pretty good.  I washed those items down with a pretty good Horchata.  

It helps to be able to count to 100 in Spanish here or you may miss when your number is called, the majority of the customers were Hispanic.  Everybody I dealt with was friendly.  They open at 8 for breakfast.  It seems they also offer baked goods for sale here.  Both the food and the location are good enough, I will be back to try out some other items."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today.  The park lot is small that is near the building, you can park on the side of it for more room.  The place is set up to order at the counter.  

I had the quesdilla paquime with chicken $5.25.  The chicken was breaded, pounded thin,  and yummy.

I eye balled the deserts (ice cream, pudding, flan, cakes, popsicles, etc.)and different drinks (bottled sodas, canned sodas, shakes, & fruit drinks).  OMG!  Too bad, I was already full."}
{"text":"This place is great. Really good food and very friendly staff. I didn't get any weird looks or bad service because I don't speak Spanish. The Torta Paquine hot was amazing. The meat was cooked perfectly and not dry at all. I'll definitely go to the one closer to my house."}
{"text":"Asked for tostitos preparados with carne asada, a melon agua and a bag of cheetos for $20! Not worth it. Carne Asada had no flavor."}
{"text":"Good food, desserts, drinks, and service.  One of the few places I can honestly say has never done us wrong, as an english speaking only customer I'd also like to add that I'm never put off or have been made to feel uncomfortable by the people working there."}
{"text":"Better service than other chain restaurants,it's clean. Very good food especially tortas. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place for their food. The tortas, twin burritos, their homemade potato chips delicious! No comparison... but lately their service is atrocious. I come and dont even get attended to so I leave after 10 min standing their. While they see me there. That was yesterday. Today I called in my order and they didnt have it ready. I called in 20 min prior and still..."}
{"text":"What a gem!!! Not located in the best of areas but you would think they were getting ready for the President to arrive and dine! This place was spotless! The cashier was extremely friendly, not pushy, offered a sample of their homemade chicken soup while I was deciding (since it was a chilly 40 degrees outside it really hit the spot!). 
  
I was undecided between two menu items and she graciously helped me decide based on customers feedback. I ordered the torta cubana.... It was fantastic. It would have been nice if it was cut into two pieces but I devoured it anyway. 

Fresh homemade torta roll, the avocado,lettuce, and tomato were fresh! The meat was delicious! Great job guys! Great selection of baked goods, homemade ice cream, palletas, and horchata.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp had pretty decent reviews I did try the chicken tacos all I can say is WOW.
Service was okay but in fairness this place was very busy which is also a good sign for this part of the valley.
I don't get down this way much but when I do this will be on my short list."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. I spent $22 dollars I'll never get back. I ordered a torta paquime (there main on the menu I guess #1 ) it was pork. I got home opened my bag and saw they HARDLY gave me any fries. So I was like okay well maybe my torta will be good. NOPE!!!!! I opened it up and it didn't even look like there was anything in my torta! I then went to take a bite and it completely FELL APART! It was the most disgusting torta I ever had and I had one slice of tomato in it. I use to love that place but after this I'm never going back. WAY TO RIP PEOPLE OFF!"}
{"text":"I loved that I was greeted so nicely by Maria as soon as I walked in. The rest of staff greeted me with such warm smiles. I ordered a breakfast burrito with bacon. It was good. I ate it with salsa verde. Very good. True Mexican flavored food!!!!"}
{"text":"The ice cream is great, the rib eye tacos and burritos are good, the tortas are ehhhh."}
{"text":"Want to try a really good torta(Mexican sandwich?  This is one of the best places in Phoenix.  It's in a rough part of town but don't worry I'm positive you will like it.  Place is always clean and their menu is awesome. You can also try the ribeye tacos as they are also pretty awesome. On the way out don't forget to pick up some Mexican sweet bread or an ice cream cone.   I would have given them 5 stars but I believe their food is expensive. They should have at least a 1 special of the day.  Expect to spend between 9 and 11 dollars for lunch."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going her, amazing Tortas !! My favorite place, they are very friendly as well and clean"}
{"text":"I ordered a torta de carne asada and literally there was like 4 small pieces of meat. There was a lot of lettuce. Very pricey for the little bit of meat you get. It is very good but very little amount of food served"}
{"text":"Haven't tried much from here other that their mangoneadas, which I love! Sometimes they pour a little heavy on the chamoy, so buyer beware! They have great Mexican paletas, my favorite is the pecan milk one! Have tried their food, therefore I can not speak on that."}
{"text":"Yummy inexpensive Mexican tortas. Very nice staff and extremely clean location. They also have desserts and pan dulce.

My torta wasn't too big but but was very filling.  Not too spicy,  but spicy enough to make my mouth water as I type this review. I got the carne asada torta and I was served with some potato chips. Delicious! 

Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"We were tired and hungry, and had lousy Mexican food a couple of nights before, so checked Yelp for a place near where we were. Saw this and decided to go. We were the only white, non Spanish speaking people there, which seemed to bode well. We both ordered something we'd never had: tacos carnitas for him, tacos volteados for me. Yum! Mine was three corn tortillas with jack cheese and a thin layer of pork melted on them. My husband said it looked like pork roll up. Then there was a slice of avocado, and half a lime to squeeze over them. They were SO GOOD!  My husband had never had what he ordered; four soft carnitas tacos, with cilantro and onion on a soft corn tortilla, which he slathered with guacamole. He isn't as verbose as I, but he said they were delicious, and it was nice to eat something different than American style Mexican food. If we're ever in Phoenix again, I would definitely go back. 
The restaurant itself is in a strip mall, bright lights, many families there, in what seemed to be the Latino part of town. It's not a place to go for the ambience, but good, fresh, reasonably priced food."}
{"text":"Been a few times now and always friendly. Good fresh food and served in a reasonable amount of time. Items on menu that are not obvious to a non Spanish speaking individual are listed in English which is nice. I personally enjoy Mexican food, but do not enjoy having to eat out with a translator."}
{"text":"The place is awesome. There are different types of items to choose from, burros, tortas, sweets, and ice cream. Must try the torta ahogada its  a savory torta with grilled pork or beef, with avocado lettuce & tomato on a telera roll covered in a delicious tomato based sauce and topped with fresh cream. They make their own ice cream here and it is the best. Try the pinenut. Very clean and awesome service. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Their tacos are great - prepared to order, and always delicious. But the popsicles -- OH, THE POPSICLES. My first visit here earlier this year, we did not get a popsicle and I'd been fantasizing about them ever since. We went here pretty much first thing on our most recent visit, and were not disappointed. We had the lime, coconut, and caramel and all of 'em were fantastic. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is very clean and inviting compared to most of the eateries in the area. They even have a nice patio section as well.  I've only eaten here once so far, but plan to return many times. I ordered the Torta Pacquime without mayo and mustard. The meat was full of flavor, the other ingredients fresh and the bread was great. I also got fries cause I wasn't sure what else to get on my first order, lol.  They were just normal shoestring fries, but were good.  I also order Arroz Con Leche / rice pudding, but after the girl took my order and I paid, she realized they were out.  So they offered a substitute.  I chose the Strawberries and Cream with nuts, which was a higher price than the original item ordered, but I didn't have to pay the difference.  This dish was amazing!  I have been craving this every day since my visit.  I will probably end up ordering this on every visit.  So yummy!  I was between 4-5 stars but the strawberries definitely bumped it up to 5.  I'll update this review if my next visit changes drastically, which I would not anticipate."}
{"text":"Do not let the location scare you off. It looks pretty trashy in that area but so far I have met nice people offering quality at the busineses I have used. Like that $3.00 car wash down the street. I am there every week.

So for Tortas. I agree it is not fast but you see them cooking your order with fresh ingredients and that just takes some time. If they are real busy at noon just be ready to stand in line.

I had the chicken Torta and I did not add any sauces - do that because it is a little bland. The people next to me said it is just understood you will go to the sauce bar and get what you prefer to spice it up. Lots of food and I enjoyed every bite. The fries were delicious but on the greasy side. 

The restaurant is clean and they have lots of seating. In addition I have found that places like this have a clientel that is ready and willing to talk to you so ask about what they ordered or meet a new friend. Try that out in Scottsdale or on Camelback and you get a very different response. (My staff hesitates to go to lunch with me because I \"meet\" people).

I will be going back here to get tacos and some of that other wonderful stuff they offer. Red Devil (best ever wings) is just down the street and  now I will have to share where I go while my car gets washed."}
{"text":"We overheard a car salesman talking about this restaurant and it just so happened we were hungry for lunch.  He gave us directions and off we went on a lucky adventure.  It seemed like a run of the mill fast food place but NO it was not.  Clean as a whistle and very good service at the counter.  I felt like I was in Mexico and so I had to ask a lot of questions.  The tortas are amazing, fresh tortas made on premises and flavor of the shredded pork was so good.  The Tacos de Ribeye were delicious & my tostada was piled high with fresh avacado with a hint of citrus maybe lime squeezed on top. We also tried the empanadas for dessert...YUM!  Don't think Mexican when you go there think \"Mexico\"...Authentic Mexico!  Don't miss the salsa bar and if you can afford the calories have a fresh strawberries and cream milkshake."}
{"text":"I am impressed with the food and the quality! Service was great! Clean! A must try for everyone!"}
{"text":"Always on the hunt for some Mexican food that reminds me of the Jalisco style when I lived in Michigan.  This place serves Tortas the way I remember and they were good.  Place is very modern looking for an Arizona Mexican Joint and I am OK with that.  Food was good.  Had the Milanesa will go back and try again."}
{"text":"Good food, bakery, ice cream, what more could you ask for? excellent."}
{"text":"First of all I wanted to start off by saying that my family and I have been coming to tortas paquime for years, this location specifically and we have never experienced bad customer service until today. 
We had a late craving for their \"fresas con crema\" knowing that they closed soon. We rushed over and made it with a few mins to spare, the open sign was still on as my husband was walking up, the employees literally looked directly at him and turned the light off and ignored the fact that he was even there. Then there was a man closing their side door and my husband explained, I understand it's late I don't want a big order just your fresas con crema and there employee even went as far as to act like he didn't speak English and didn't understand what my husband was saying then closed the door on him. 
Today has been officially the day that they will no longer receive any of our business. I am so disappointed at the way that this situation was handled. Coming from managing our own small business, It's unfortunate to see such bad customer service. Never will we ever come here again."}
{"text":"I am a big time fan of this small Torta shop in Avondale and I really enjoy their food as it gets me away from mainstream Mexican food joints and into a touch of something different. I have tried 3 different torta's and have yet to have a menu item there that I did not thoroughly enjoy. They have fresh ingredients and love to use the avocado in many plates which is killer if your are a fan. They also choose to use higher quality meats in their menu items as you get ribeye tacos and a better cut of pork. I tried their super nachos last night and though they were different and used actual nacho cheese I really enjoyed the dish as well, and it was loaded with meat, cheese, and guacamole. The salsa bar has some real fire kicking salsas so be mindful not to dump it in your sammy or you will get burned on both ends. The service is great and friendly, it's always clean, and you won't feel like an outsider if you come with friends or family to eat a meal here. I would recommend this to my yelp friends."}
{"text":"Ribeye tacos!!  Heaven. Trust me, I was born and raised in Mexico city and that combo of little home made flour tortillas and beef colliding  with lime juice and salsa... Brings me back home..
Congratulations Tortas paquime. 
Tortas good not the best 
Place is spotless!! And their bakery is sensational. 
You have to eat here no matter what."}
{"text":"So the food was just bland. Nothing special about it at all but the reason I will go back is the fact that they have amazing gelato!!! They give you a ton for the price too. So check it out for dessert only!"}
{"text":"Don't mind the area friends.  This is a great authentic spot to get a Torta.  They have a large selection of Aqua frescas and baked goods.  Tacos are delicious as well."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 4 times before and always had great service and food. This time, the lady taking your order was extremely rude and my torta had very little carne asada and it had no flavor. I won't be returning or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"First off, the food is delicious. There is no doubt about that! Everything always tastes great. The place suffers a little from customer service, though. Today we went in and my husband ordered some ribeye tacos. I think they ran out of ribeye because they clearly gave him carne asada but then denied that it was carne asada which really made my husband mad! They should have just said they ran out and replaced with carne asada and it wouldn't have been a big deal. The salsas are good, the place is decently clean, but the line does get SUPER long sometimes even with two registers running. I'd probably grudgingly go back."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location, the food is awesome and delicious.  From tacos to tortas and also their spectacular desserts."}
{"text":"Pretty solid. Great tortas, nachos, and quesadillas. Really great prices. Excellent dessert selection."}
{"text":"Great place , great atmosphere and great food! You can call ahead of time and place your order. Lunch time is very busy! But they cook everything fresh and you can see them preparing your meal."}
{"text":"Best Tortas in the valley. We had the torta Mexicana and fish tacos. Both are delicious. My favorite is the torta cubana. The pan dulce they sell is the best as well. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Very bad food, the food was extremely salty and gross! We ordered corn and it was freezing!"}
{"text":"Excellent Tortas served with homemade potato chips. Enjoyed a Torta Paquime made with pork loin, avocado, tomato, jalapeños, mayo and mustard on a soft roll. Also enjoyed their homemade ice cream in a waffle cone."}
{"text":"The quesadilla is good. The portions are pretty good. The side salad is kinda bland. The steak in the quesadilla is well made and plentiful. Worth the visit if you need some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Love the flautas and Tortas! The agua de hochata is really good too!"}
{"text":"Really delicious chicken tacos, bean and cheese burrito and twin burritos. Glass bottle soda and spicy guacamole. Very delicious and reasonably priced. Less than $20 for 3 plates"}
{"text":"Best Paquime so far! The staff here is very friendly. The food look like a million dollars and tastes on point. I asked for a deep fried jalapeño and the chef was happy to help me. I will definitely come back and invite clients to lunch here. Great job Paquime!"}
{"text":"I think this place is over rated. Food is decent but not the greatest. I just don't like the small portions of food u get with the tortas and combo plates. I do love that they are very clean, and everything is done in front of u. I'll still be back to try other options as they do have a great variety.  I recommend eating 2 tortas as they r pretty small in size."}
{"text":"This was my second time coming to this restaurant. It's close enough to my work so I hoping it would be my go to spot for Mexican food. But I will continue looking since it left a bad taste in my mouth. 

The first time I went I ordered the Burrotote (Big Burrito) it's a joke. its more of a large taco.  Besides the false advertisement its flavor was bland especially since it has iceberg lettuce. 

I gave them another chance since it's supposed to be known for their Tortas anyway. I ordered the cochinita pibil Torta. I ordered it but the problem was that I was left waiting for my food for 25 minutes and when I went and asked the cook for my sandwich he said someone else had taken it. I went up to the counter where I ordered and the lady at the front ignored me. So I walk back to the cook and asked him to make it to go. 

THe torta was good, I have to admit, but I was dissapointed by the whole experience. Hey if you want to take your chance at this restaurant go ahead but why do it since Reyes de la Torta is just south of the street from them."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a Mexicana with avocado instead of steak and a Melon drink. It was just the right meal before going home for the night. The sandwich was delicious. I must warn that it is a bit messy to eat due to the soft bread packed full of yumminess."}
{"text":"One of the places I miss the most about living in the Southwest. The food is reasonably priced and tasty as hell! I have yet to have a bad entree and the bakery also satisfies the sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Bomb.com love this place and it's yummy drinks and Popsicles!  My kiddo loved the Hawaiian torta, and the guacamole is good. Good beans too! The veggie torta could stand to be improved! It's pretty plain with mayo tomatoes and avacado ."}
{"text":"I've been to two tortas paquime and this was horrible. I stood in front of the register with 3 different employees making eye contact and recognizing I was there while the line built up out the door until one started to help me, took my order, walked away and then a new employee came up and we started over.

The food is not good enough to justify the chaos and horrible service."}
{"text":"Never miss with this place must haves are the ribeye tacos or torts and the aquas frescas!! I always come here when I have a taco or Mexican street fair craving all the food is amazingly great!!"}
{"text":"Great place... highly recommended. All the food is delicious. My favorite are the steak tacos and the torta cubana. Friendly employees and the place is clean!"}
{"text":"The place looks like a dump from outside- like a fast food restaurant and the food is not much better. Went with my wife- she ordered a flauta and tostada, myself a carne asada torta. We shared a junior nachos to start.

The nachos were literally movie theatre nachos. I didn't mind this as movie theater nachos are actually quite yummy, but this I not regal cinemas- I wanted Mexican nachos.

My torta was good- a little on the small side but tasted pretty good. Now the chips that came with it were another story. STALE, literally chewy and I had to spit the one I tried out.

Her tostada had parchment paper in it cooked in with the meat. While it had good flavor, once we noticed it we lost our appetite.

The flautas had minimal flavor (if my wife were writing she would say no flavor whatsoever) and were extremely dry.

Needless to say I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had the asada torta and he has the torta Ahogada. We also ordered the chips and guac, a Strawberry Jarritos and diet coke. My  torta was good. Just as I expected. His torta had literally no meat on it. It would have been an amazing sandwich if there had been more than a sliver of pork. The guac wasn't impressive either. I don't think I will be back unless I am in a pinch. Not the best torta IMO. Los Reyes holds that title in my book for now."}
{"text":"I would not come here. I used to visit the Paquime on the west side and that one is pretty authentic. This is my first time trying this one, and I was definitely disappointed. I brought my husband here thinking we would get the same great service and food as the one on the west side and I was wrong. We came in and were attended by the cashier, who wasn't very friendly. We're bringing our business here and they make us feel like we owe them. Now, the tacos al pastor we're bland and little to no meat in them. My husband complained that his torta just tasted like cardboard, almost no flavor. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Good food and great price, i live in between 2 of the 3 stores and i like that they are always clean, fast and friendly service! I always get the torta cubana and  i also like the fresh bread that they have, not to mention the price is cents on the dollar! Also the drinks are great my favorite is Horchata which is always fresh and cold! I would recommend this place to any body! Great place for great price!"}
{"text":"Todo lo que venden aquí está muy rico, desde las tortas hasta los snacks, pan de dulce, nieve y a muy buen precio"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food for a very cheap price! Tres leches and their pork tacos were delicious. The real winner was the yogurt salad!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican taste. Clean. Fast service. Friendly environment."}
{"text":"Yum, yum...and yum. I have been meaning to write a review for a while and forget each time I go. Pretty much nothing but good things to say. The food is cooked fresh and right in front of you. I usually order a torta, but my friend and I opted to split a torta and quesadilla last time...delish! Lots of cheese and lots of carne. Went there the other week for a quesadilla and fries w/ cheese. Filled up on the huge portion of fries and only had a bite or 2 of the quesadilla. Brought home the leftovers for dinner, only to find out at dinner that my fiancé ate the ENTIRE thing, and NEVER eats anything with beef. I guess that says it right there. Again...yum."}
{"text":"Had the tacos, a torta and the pan dulce. Well between 2 people. A great place. Real food. And fairly priced. Very clean. Will be coming back"}
{"text":"Way out west, we're saturated with hit-or-miss little Mexican spots. Paquime is definitely a hit, specializing in sandwiches and desserts. 

So many kinds of desserts. 

First, I'd tried the chocolate chip ice cream. The consistency and richness of it lets you immediately know it's the real deal, and will be totally satisfying. I also tried the nuez or \"nut\" ice cream...I think it was pecan? I'm not sure. Could not be any more vague...it tasted to me like pancake syrup ice cream, which I didn't like, but my breakfast-loving dining companion fell in love with. 

After a few minutes, my quesadilla was ready (ha! I didn't even get a torta!). Instead of having precooked steak like a lot of the competition, it looked and tasted like it was made fresh to order. It was complete with tomato and avocado slices. I must admit it was a little skimpy--I ended up tasting everything *but* the cheese every other bite...but it was still tasting great, even if a bit on the small side. 

I'll update you when I actually try the main attraction here, a torta with fries. But until then just know that you're getting some good quality stuff for the price, and that even if you're just feeling pastries or ice cream, Paquime is still worth dropping by."}
{"text":"their $5 carne asade torta has a full avocado in it and great bread!

i don't care for their elote--it's served as a gloppy mess in a cup instead of on the cob!"}
{"text":"Checked this spot out due to me having some time to kill,  being in the area and of course yelp reviews.  I had the ribeye taco combo and they were great, cooked to perfection and included avocado and gac,  most places charge extra for this so this was an added pleasure to my experience. 

I definitely have this place on my spot to revisit after my visit today."}
{"text":"La Torta Hawaiana is the best thing on the menu. It comes with a small side of chipotle sauce and crispy chips. Definitely need to try their horchata and fresas con crema."}
{"text":"After my big move from Texas to Arizona my first order of business was looking for a good mexican place. Although this place looks like a mexican restaurant gone corporate, I gave it a try and I was not disappointed. So far I have tried the rolled tacos with shredded beef and I've tried the mexican torta. The rolled tacos came with fresh avocados, something you don't readily see at a fast food mexican joint. The green sauce and side of red sauce were the perfect companion. They also coat the tacos in sour cream and crumbly white cheese which made them all that much better. The torta was equally good but a little too nice and neat for me, I am used to a well designed mess in a bun. The Horchata was also good, not too sweet and not too watered down. The only complaint I have is that it's a little pricier than most fast food mexican joints like filibertos and the like, but I can't complain too much because the food was well made and well worth the price. I venture to say that this might just well become my regular mexican place, sorry Humbertos."}

{"text":"For those unfamiliar with tortas, they are the quintessential Mexican sandwich. Tortas Paquime is a place to get these wonderful sandwiches. It is also a bakery and a place to get Mexican refreshments and ice cream. 

The restaurant is clean, and appears to be well maintained. The service is quick and efficient any employees appear to know what they're doing. 

I ordered the torta paquime, the restaurant is named after it so... It was pretty good, but I think I'll try something different next time.  It appeared to be some type of pork that was cooked beforehand and serve in kind of like a cold salad . It was roughly diced and put between 2 soft pieces of bread with tomato avocado and possibly mayonnaise. Not exactly something I would normally order but good nonetheless. I also ordered a vegetarian tostada, to try something more familiar, and it was excellent. I also had the soup of the day, which was like tortilla soup without the tortillas--very good. I would return just for the soup alone.. I wouldn't want my lack of knowledge regarding tortas to cloud my review. I will be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Went there with an entertainment book buy one free coupon that they would not honor even though it had every thing in plain sight to be seen. Not a way to do business."}
{"text":"The worst, I repeat the worst customer service by far. We had a previous bad experience with a younger lady that worked behind the counter. But, I get it people have bad days. I decided to give them another try tonight calling in my order. I get half way through my order with the older lady on the phone, she was extremely rude, uninformative and pushy. I had to hang up on her and will take my business elsewhere. I know that you don't care that I'm going elsewhere but get your staff together and teach them some customer service. What a mistake."}
{"text":"this is my favorite torta place!  the tortas are filled w/ a good amount of meat and such... my favorite is the asada torta.  most of their tortas have a generous amount of avocados (which are my favorite).. soo delish! ive also tried the torta paquime, which was pretty good as well. 

ive tried tortas at tons of other places, including los reyes de la torta (which is good, dont get me wrong..) but i think the deal breaker for me is the bread... the bread they use at torta paquime is just sooo goood, i cant think of any other way to describe it.

their agua frescas are good too! you can sample them before you pick one... my favorite is the mango.. and the limonada is a close second... 

the nachos are a great side.. the cheese tastes a little buttery... you might think, is buttery cheese good?  it is!  however, when you get it to go, the chips get pretty soggy.. i need to ask if they can put it on the side!

they have tons of baked goods and desserts that i am always too full to try.. but my friends have tried them and enjoyed them... 

ive also been to the 31st ave/van buren location, as well as the mcdowell/24th st location.. all of them have had the same great food and good service! :)"}
{"text":"i love this place and all the food, as ive said in my other review at the other location..

BUT i am so sad that every time i come to this location, they never have the mango agua fresca. :("}
{"text":"Finally decided to try Tortas Paquime. I did not realize how much business this place does. All of the tables inside were occupied when we arrived and there was a steady flow of people the whole time we were there. I ordered the twin burritos (1 green chile beef and 1 shredded pork with no guac), as well as the super nachos with carne asada (guac on the side) to share with my boyfriend. The twin burritos look like four because they are cut in half on the plate, but they are skinny so it's manageable. I really liked the green chile beef. The shredded pork was ok, but I wasn't a fan of whatever smoky spices are used in the meat. I added some salsa verde to help out the flavor. The nachos were great! Yummy meat, nacho cheese, and beans with sour cream on tortilla chips. Mmm mm! Simple and delicious. This little restaurant also has Mexican pastries and ice cream. I'm pretty sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price. Fresh ingredients, authentic, with lots of options. Friendly staff. Try the flautas or the Torta de Aguacate! Great aguas frescas too. (I like getting a mix of limonada & jamaica). All their avocados are cut fresh while they cook."}
{"text":"Favorite quick Mexican food in the valley. Everything is fresh, try the avocado torta or the chicken flautas. Good service, great prices, amazing food. Aguas frescas are great too, ask for a Jamaica mixed with limon."}
{"text":"If you plan on coming to this location during lunch time, prepare yourself for a line. Although, they were pretty damn quick at making sandwiches. I had to look out side and make sure I wasn't at a Jimmy Johns. lol. Anyways, I ordered the Torta Mexicana with French fries and a drink. I was pretty impressed on all the flavors I was getting from the torta. The French fries were very crispy, and the horchata was on point. I will be returning back to try there other tortas."}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!

We stopped to get vegetarian lunch and they had quite a few options, all of which were fabulous. The veggie tacos were outstanding, although comparatively pricey well worth it. The cheese on the tostada was fresh cotija.

 The food was also great value for money, the veggie torta was big, so was the three leches. The skins of avocado in all the dish were sooooo satisfying!

Great gem! Sad I found it just as I was leaving Phoenix."}
{"text":"Took my team to lunch today at Tortas. I was impressed at how busy it was as the line was out the door. We moved quickly through the line and had our food out relatively fast considering how many people were there. I had the fish tacos and they were fantastic. Just the right amount of food. Fish were seasoned perfectly and lightly breaded, unique and fantastic. I can honestly say this was unlike any fish taco I've had at any other valley restaurant. Well done"}
{"text":"Great great place to eat the food is fresh. The restaurant is clean. And friendly. One of the best mom and pop places to go"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tacos!!!! The ribeye tacos were great. Great staff of people working"}
{"text":"My buddy at work has been hyping this place up.  He told me that they had really good tortas and that the food was legit.  I'm always down to try out a good torta.  I headed on down and decided to check it out.

I walked in, scoped out the menu for a minute and then placed my order.  I went with a Rib Eye Torta, no mayo and I also went with an order of Papas Nachos (criss cut fries smothered in nacho cheese).  My total was just under $12.00.  They handed me my receipt, I grabbed my fork/napkins/water etc and sat down.  Soon thereafter, my number was called.  Here is how everything was..................

Rib Eye Torta ($6.99)-  It looked fantastic.  The taste of it left a lot to be desired though.  This thing came with a 1/2 lb of rib eye steak, lettuce, tomato, jalapenos and avocado.  This was presented on a nice soft roll.  That was part of the problem though.  The roll was incredibly tasty.  It fell apart way too easy though.  I've had that happen a few times at various places.  They use great bread, but its horrible bread for the sandwich.  Stand alone-=fantastic.  Topped with meats and such=really bad.  The steak tasted alright.  It had a little bit of gristle/fat on it (rib eye usually does so it wasn't that big of a deal), and the portion was a little skimp.  Seemed like less than 8 ounces for sure.  The lettuce, tomato and jalapeno were good.  The avocado was good on half the sandwich but the other half had brown spots on most of the slices.  Why does AZ produce suck so bad?  I picked around most of it and finished the sandwich.  It came with a few homemade potato chips which were tasty.  The sandwich overall though was just ok.  Not worth coming back for that specific sandwich. 

Papas Nachos ($3.99)-  Waffle/criss cut fries topped with molten cheese sauce.  I really enjoyed these.  The fries reminded me of old school Carls Jr criss cuts.  The cheese sauce reminded me of Portillos cheese sauce (one of my favorites).  This dish was delicious.  Perfectly fried and seasoned potatoes loaded with a generous amount of gooey cheese.  I would get these again in a heartbeat.  They were the best part of my meal.

Service was friendly enough,and the place was really clean.  Would I come back?  Eh...maybe? If I do, I'll definitely try a different torta besides the rib eye.   I'm usually disappointed in Tortas though.  Once you have had a Wash Mobile Torta, http://www.yelp.com/biz/tortas-wash-mobile-tijuana, nothing else compares!  Sadly, I judge every Torta compared to Wash Mobile and maybe I need to stop doing that?  Who knows.  It is what it is!"}
{"text":"I actually love this little place. It's clean and the staffs are friendly! 

First time I came here I got the Torta Cubana and the Torta Mexicana. Both tortas were good, but I definitely loved the Cubana much more. The torta (I think this is the bread part) is tasty and soft. I could probably just eat the bread itself, but the mix of meat and the juices...that's a whole new taste bud there...so good!

They have a few salsas and grilled veggies free for grabs. They also have ice cream or gelato; not sure which one. I haven't tried any of the desserts, but they look tempting. 

Came back and got the Tacos de Ribeye which is so good!!! They give you lots of meat and I love how it comes with a slice of avocado on each taco! 

I didn't even know they had pastry on the other side of the restaurant until the second time I came...LoL! I came here 3 times within the first week that I discovered this place. I'm actually not much of a sandwich person, but the Cubana satisfies me completely. =o)"}
{"text":"Been going there for over a year now and am always satisfied with the tacos de ribeye which I've gotten every time. Very well made and big enough to fill my appetite. Will definitely be trying the tortas next time after seeing them here!"}
{"text":"Been to the other on 43rd, so haven't tried any of their dinner meals but the breakfast was still pretty good. The lady at the counter was very friendly."}
{"text":"Good satisfying food. Comes out fairly quick and the staff is nice and friendly. If you are getting an order to go they yell out your number in Spanish so get ready to use the Spanish you learned in high school 15 years ago if your a pinche gringo like me."}
{"text":"The tortas are so delicious and the service was fast. Being Mexican myself, this is now my favorite torta restaurant. May I recommend the Torta de Milanesa de Res."}
{"text":"We just moved in the area and were trying out the local restaurants and gave this place a shot. It is always seems fairly busy and has a good amount of available seating, the situation parking is okay considering its in a higher traffic area. 

Anywho- I had the torta Paquime which was damn awesome (fyi: the sauce topping was very spicy so a side of horchata is definitely recommended!). The boyfriend got soup (I forget which but they all sounded delish) and he really enjoyed it- surprising bc he can be finicky lol. The torta was garnished with homemade style potato chips- at first you'd might assume that they're being skimpy with them but the sandwiches are usually more than plenty by themselves. 
They had a salsa bar too which was much appreciated- gotta have my side of grilled jalapeño!
The pan dulce here looks off the charts tasty but I've yet to try them out :-) Can't wait to sample their breakfast!"}
{"text":"The horrible customer service will leave you with a horrible taste in your mouth. Cashiers are very unhelpful when it comes to their menu. Food is ok nothing to go out of your way about."}
{"text":"I recommend this location because of its great taste in food (especially their aguas frescas) and their cleanliness. The cashier let me taste most of the waters to get the one I really wanted. The presentation and the taste of their food is amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places I have tried in Phoenix. I tried the Nachos once but I didn't like them. It didn't have melted cheese, wth! Nachos should have melted cheese not shredded. I don't know if they're always served like that but I wouldn't try them again.  However, I LOVE their carne asada torta! I love the bread, I love the savory taste of the meat! I love this place. Their salsas are good and the amount of avocado they use in the torta is good too. I also like their aguas frescas. They are not made from concentrate like most places. They truly taste good, they are super sweet though, but my favorite is the lime one because it's not as sweet.... but it's still pretty sweet. I like the corn in a cup, they do not use canned corn which is a huge plus. I also like their strawberries and cream. Yum! They're sweet bread is good too! I would try to get it as fresh as possible though. But that's with any bread. :)"}
{"text":"Torta Paquime is a big hit.  I got their pork Tortas and it was huge and delicious.  They also go above and beyond with an ice cream bar, fun Hispanic music, and a bakery in the store.  Definitely worth a stop!"}
{"text":"¿Dónde es la peda?

Over effing here.  I've only been here a few times but I love it!  I've had their quesadilla paquime, a few bites of my friend's ribeye tacos, their tortas cubana, and some other bites here and there.  Everything I've had here has always been fresh and flavorful and the portions are decent for their price.  As for their horchata... delicious and refreshing!

Tortas Paquime is a casual dining spot that's always busy.  Don't forget to make a stop at their salsa bar.  They also have huge cases of baked pastries and a very impressive ice cream bar.  I have yet to try their sweets but they look pretty damn amazing.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, and there's ample parking all around.  Thumbs up for yummy tortas!  ¡A huevo!"}
{"text":"Great tortas and baked goods too - will definitely be coming back! Place is very friendly and locally owned too."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is great! The gelato was amazing, try to save some room for it."}
{"text":"If you crave a good torta you should try Paquime. Best bread, carne asada has good flavor, and the home made chips give your meal a nice crunch. They also have  yummy ice cream and the flavor is creamy and one of a kind. Fresh tortas at a good price."}
{"text":"If you have never had this place I would encourage you to give them a shot! They have some authentic Mexican food, they are fast, they are friendly, they are affordable, but most importantly they are delicious!I tried the ribeye tacos, and I have never had tacos this good! They make them on small homemade flour tortillas, so the tortillas do not overpower the food.  I love this place and will definitely make it a regular spot! Don't miss out if you like Mexican food, then this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Pork carnitas were pretty good. The twin burritos were really good and the red hot sauce was awesome will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch here with my husband before a football game. Between the two of us we tried the fried fish, carnitas and rib eye tacos. We both thought they were all great- with the fish being our favorite. For the quality and taste the price is awesome. Would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This local yum spot had me from the moment I walked thru the front door. Sparkling clean counters, and a friendly greeting. You'll see their delicious gelato in the case near the register and delectable pastries to your right upon entering. But the best part of this visit were the tortas themselves. I had the Torta Paquime traditional with grilled carne asada, fresh avocado, lettuce, and a crisply toasted bun. My son had a smothered torta with slices of tender pork and a flavorful sauce. Love the beverage choices too! We will be back."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people like this place! To me it was just okay. I honestly didn't feel it was worth the price. The drinks were extremely expensive & no options to make it a meal we had to buy everything individually. Not to mention a shirtless tweaker was waving his finger in a no gesture at the restaurant window."}
{"text":"Tortas Paquime has the best authentic Mexican food I've had in Arizona.
Parking can be a struggle during busy lunch hours but once you get inside it's worth it."}
