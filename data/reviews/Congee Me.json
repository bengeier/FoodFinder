{"text":"Authentic northern Chinese cuisine that seriously impressed my spicy, intense, and meaty food loving father. He recommends the intestine dish, leg of lamb, and garlic cucumber. I'd definitely order the purple rice congee if you need something sweet to munch on while watching the more spice-tolerant members of your party wolf down their food :p"}
{"text":"Used to be my go-to chinese restaurant when it had more spicy dishes. Since they've changed the menu there are more buns and congee. Overall, there are a variety of food choices and the food comes pretty quickly. Service can be a bit rude sometimes. They have this new policy where they don't accept credit card unless you spend over $30 so it's good to keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Offers a variety of Cantonese food on their menu.   1) We went for beef brisket soup noodles. Portion was pretty large but there was barely any brisket! Any pieces that were found were mostly small fatty pieces. Forgettable dish.  2) Next up was the beef wraps. Beef was a little dry, but otherwise good flavor from the sauce. The wrap was so dry it was falling apart by itself as well.  3) 4 season peas. This dish came cold and oily. Again anther forgettable dish.  4) small dragon dumplings. Clearly the star of the show. The soup held up in the dumpling which is the key. Lots of flavor in the soup without tasting too salty.  Atmosphere looked like any general old Chinese restaurant. Prices were relatively reasonable actually.  Just meh"}
{"text":"My family and I were repeat customers but after what happened the last time I went, we aren't planning on going back. While ordering, our waitress somehow got the impression that when we were discussing which noodles to pick to eat, that we wanted both of them. After finding out that this had happened when two noodle dishes arrived at our table, we told them that we didn't order two, we only wanted one. The waitress told us that since the food had left the kitchen, they couldn't do anything about it. There was no way for us to have known that this was going to happen from the time we put in our order and from the time that the food had left the kitchen. They made us pay for the noodles that we didn't even want. They need to treat their customers better."}
{"text":"Food is okay as any other congee restaurant.  Service here is awful.  Stay away if you don't want to be ignored all the time.  No one deserves to be ignored and humiliated when you are just trying to enjoy a meal.  STAY AWAY!!  STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay,  the portions were pretty small. Bad service,  waitress was impatience and rude. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"disgusting service, i never want to have my meal inside. Plz, take out, if you do not want to \"enjoy\" the poker face and chasing you for tip. I don't even know how can they ask for tips for such service :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why I always forget to write a review of this place, my family have been regulars for years. The $1 congee is definitely amazing for congee lovers. Simple but great tasting bowls of congee. However, my favourite things on the menu is definitely their noodles and pan fried dumplings. All of their noodle dishes are amazing. Their hand pulled noodles are amongst the best I've had around here, and portions are huge. Their dumplings are super juicy and just addicting. Their menu has a large selection of food and everything I've ever tried I was pretty impressed with, especially given their price point. My family will obviously continue to be regulars and I definitely recommend anyone to try their noodles."}
{"text":"THE best comfort food ever. Their congee is very family style and price is so reasonable! All the entrees are very delicious and highly recommend the red bean paste thingy!! Love this restaurant! Their cooking style is a bit to the northern part of china just FYI."}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable prices. Noodles, congee, dumplings... this place has a great menu."}
{"text":"I give this place 3 stars because the food is delicious. The service is not there but that's common in Chinese places. AND they do not accept credit cards and only debit cards if you spend 30 before taxes.  We had their handmade buns, noodles, beef wrap, seaweed appetizer, and fried intestines. My favorites were the noodle soup and the fried intestines. The beef wrap is not as good as other places. I would not recommend it. There is a parking lot so easy for parking. There are also a lot of tables so you don't have to wait too long."}
{"text":"Wow, so this place has a lot more stuff than I had imagined. Always just passed by this place thinking it has limited food items given their restaurant name.  A friend was in the neighborhood and was very surprised that I have never tried this place yet as it has a lot of food choices at very affordable prices...and so we went.   It has a hidden big parking lot at the back of the restaurant and you can also get in from the back.  We ordered a variety of things so I can try a little bit of everything. Our server spoke Mandarin and the food came out very fast. Everything was pretty tasty and I would come back to try a bunch of their other items.   The place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Service was a bit chaotic l, but the food is great! I'd go back regardless of the chaotic customer service."}
{"text":"5/5 food, 1/5 Service.  Do not ask if you want water Do not take ANY plates away Must walk up to them to order or get anything. See photos attached"}
{"text":"Super, duper cheap eats!  It was a party of 3 and this is what we ordered...  1. Pumpkin congee (purple coloured) - $0.99 // Small bowl but enough for one. Love the colour but a little too sweet for me (I have a giant sweet tooth so it means something when I say it's sweet) 2. Fried pancake with beef roll - $5.99 // Best item we ordered, extremely filling and you can't really go wrong with this 3. Shredded chicken with Szechwan sauce (spicy) - $5.49 // Not a fan of this, very little 'shredded' chicken and too spicy for a non-spicy eater like me 4. Clear noodles in chili sauce $3.99 // Large portions and great taste with the chilli sauce on the side 5. Steamed bun $0.99 // Tasted like any regular steamed bun with choi but it was a major turn-off when I saw them take the bun out of the freezer, microwave it, and serve it to us...  All in all, it cost $19.xx + tip for a dinner for 3. Food isn't outstanding but I see myself visiting again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"There's a fly in our Mao Po toufu, we notified the waitress and were offered 10% off our bill, although we had to leave a lot of food on the table. How generous!? The back door to the kitchen is wide open, we could hear stir fry noise when walking around the building. Not sure if it's because today's too hot or there's no proper ventilation or AC in kitchen. Feel free to go if you don't care about what's in your dish."}
{"text":"the pumpkin congee tastes like someone chugged a whole bottle of corn syrup and then tried to shit it out and the service was even worse btw its cash only and the waitress felt the need to remind me three times"}
{"text":"I drove by this place for years and never went in.  Well, I decided to visit this place with my father.  The place is modern and clean.  The staff was very attentive.  The food was above my expectations.  There were some food in Chinese characters but luckily my dad can read it.  We had Pork buns, Pumpkin congee, Pork and Preserved Egg congee, Beef wraps, Squids and Lamb skewers and Chinese donuts.  This place is inexpensive and the quality of food was excellent.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This little place is average. The food quality is okay and the prices are reasonable. I would say their steam buns and their purple rice congee would be my favorite from their menu."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Cheap eats.  The congee was barely warm, prefer if it was hotter.  I would recommend this place if you have a craving for Shanghai and Mandarin food at a budget."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious! It's not super expensive and it doesn't take the kitchen long to bring out your dish. Washroom needs to be cleaned and some dishes are a bit too oily, but it's a chinese restaurant so I don't expect any less. Service also could be improved, waiters are quick to react, but aren't as helpful as one would like. Dirty dishes aren't cleared when complete, food is always placed on the corner of the table even when the centre is empty. Nothing big and it doesn't shadow the great food, but it's still something to be improved upon. Overall, very good"}
{"text":"So much value!!! I came here because of a recommendation on the $1 congee. For such a low price, you will be amazed by the great taste and quantity.    The seamed buns here are phenomenal!!! For $1 these are such a steal! My favourite flavour is the pork & chives. The buns come out piping hot and bursting with filling and juice.   Needless to say, I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good.  Decently priced.  Closes much later than what's shown on Yelp."}
{"text":"I was craving congee this evening so I stumbled in expecting a Congee Queen knockoff of some sort but instead I was met with dumplings and noodles! I was just about to turn around and dashed out but realized that the parking situation makes it almost impossible to dash (it's a little tight). And after just enduring a 6+ hour drive I wasn't exactly looking forward to stepping back into the car any time soon. Needless to say, I settled.  The menu is interesting with lots and lots of items that will definitely appeal to you if you're Chinese. Anything from appetizers, dumplings, pancakes, noodles and even desserts all look (in pictures) and sound ridiculously good. The prices are so low that they are a bargain when compared to McDs!  We had dumplings, pan fried onion pancakes and 2 bowls of noodles. The dumplings were some of the best ones I've tasted in the city. The filling is very flavourful and juicy and the wrapper tasted fresh and delicately thin. Albeit I wish there was a harder sear on the wrapper as it didn't crisp up like the way I like it. Noodles were perfectly done  with a full flavoured broth. Noodles have that delicate yet distinctive chew that only hand pulled noodles have. The best was for last and it's the pancake. Fantastic sear with a deliciously eggy filling with strong hints of onions and garlic from the chives. When it was all said and done, we left with a check well under $30 with taxes and tips.  This was a surprise discovery and despite the deceptive name I would recommend this place. I know some folks have mentioned about the wait times but we didn't encounter it during our visit but keep in mind we visited around 10pm."}
{"text":"Congee Me fooled me at least. I thought it was going to be a congee place in the sense of Cantonese food with a variety of noodles, bbq, and congee. This place is a Northern Chinese restaurant that offers up staples like some Sichuan dishes, northern dim sum, and even hand-pulled noodles. The place is small, but very nice on the inside.  They do offer congee from the North like Pumpkin congee and Millet Rice congee. We gave them a shot as it was a favorite of my girlfriend's, but I found it lacking any sort of flavor (which might be part of the appeal??). Apparently good for when you're sick, so keep that in mind.   The chicken with chili and bean sauce was good. I enjoyed the thick sauce that coated it and the fact that it was chilled chicken is always a favorite.The tofu with preserved veggies were OK. I enjoyed the freshness of the tofu, but the preserved veggie taste is something i'm not very fond of. The fried dumplings were decent, but a bit too greasy.   The absolute best part of the meal and the reason the rating is so high is because of the braised beef noodle soup. Everything from the broth and the meat were good. I enjoyed the noodles because they were perfect and they are hand pulled in-house. You can watch from your table as the lady is smacking noodle against her wooden board. Soup broth was great and the meat was tender.  I would make my way back for just the noodle soup next time. The other items were good, but not enough to make me want to come back over and over again. The food was fresh though and it's definitely worth a stop over."}
{"text":"if you love congee then give this place a try.   The congee are $1-$1.95 per item, they come with a good size and very tasty. I bought a take-out here last night, and the quality is absolutely amazing. It's one of the best congee I had in Toronto, and its so cheap!  I am definitely going back to try more of their other dishes."}
{"text":"We try their hand pulled noodle. Our order was pork bun, vegetable congee, braised beef noodle and mushroom with chicken noodle. It was not bad in my opinion but the after taste kinda overwhelming. Noodle Portion was big, I almost can't finish my noodle. Congee was small portion and watery but my lo love it."}
{"text":"This place is my go to restaurant to order delivery whenever I feel like eating close to authentic Szhechuan or Beijing style food. What a lot of people don't know is that they do delivery even until late night. With minimum purchase of $30 before tax, they'll deliver to any of the condos near Scarborough Town Centre and to around the Scarborough area, right to your door, within the hour. The international students living in the area considers this place to be better than all the other Chinese restaurants that does delivery, and would order from them whenever they miss their mom's Chinese cooking. So if you're a hungry student in the STC area, definitely try them out."}
{"text":"This place was busy on a Saturday afternoon, but I managed to get a table for two without waiting.  Our food came out fairly quick.  I didn't like the texture of the rice as it was too thick in the pork and preserved egg congee.  The dumplings I tried tasted delicious as it was so juicy and flavourful.  The beef roll was also yummy- it reminded me of Peking duck because of the similar wrap.  The beef brisket noodle portion was HUGE - can definitely feed more than two people.  There was way too much noodle in it.  Overall, I enjoyed majority of their food.  However, the temperature of all my food came out \"warm\".  It wasn't as hot as I wanted.  I like to have my food hot, steaming, boiling especially when I dine in."}
{"text":"Great price for the food we ordered! We were hoping to go for the Baozi ($1/each!) however we went quite late so they ran out;  We ordered: 1. Preserved egg & pork congee 2. Spicy hand-ripped chicken 3. Xiaolong Bao 4. Cold rice noodles  5. Chives pancake   The service was relatively fast, though the service was mediocre. Overall, the food (especially the congee) was on the salty side but flavors were authentic of northern cuisine. Can't wait to go back to try the baozi!"}
{"text":"I didn't think this place would be so busy! I came here on a Saturday night with my parents and we waited a few minutes before we got seated.  I had to get the pumpkin congee and it's possibly the worst pumpkin congee I've ever had in the city. It was so bland, it tasted like plain congee. Since it was so flavourless, I waited for the chicken with chilli sauce to arrive to pair together.   The chicken with chilli sauce was ok. I came to this restaurant just to try this dish and I was slightly let down. I've been searching for a restaurant that can make this dish as good as a restaurant I used to go to that unfortunately closed down. I think this dish could use a little bit more of the sesame/peanut sauce and less chilli. It was extremely spicy which I anticipated so it went well with the congee.  We ordered a pork and leek bun and it was very flavourful. This is something I would highly recommend.  We also got the beef wrap which is one of my all time favourite thing to eat and it's also very well done here.  For dessert, we got pumpkin pancake and it was ok. Not much pumpkin flavour but it was sweet and oily and really hit the spot."}
{"text":"I came here upon the recommendation of a friend.  One thing the other reviews haven't seemed to touch on is the terrible service. Perhaps it was a unique situation? Upon entering, which was half-full on a Sunday afternoon, we were greeted by a surly waitress. We were calling her for 10 minutes while she was sweeping the floor before she finally took our order. Afterwards we asked an other lady for a spoon and never got it. It could possibly be because we were using Cantonese to converse with them and they were more comfortable speaking Mandarin?   Anyways, the food was relatively decent. However, the pumpkin congee lacked rice or pumpkin flavour and was very starchy. I hear the purple rice congee is better so maybe I'll try that next time. The chive and pork bun was very good with plenty of filling, and the beef roll was very crunchy and delicious. The proportions are very large and it's definitely great value for money as our bill came to slightly more than $10 and we were quite full.   However, given the attitude of the staff, I'd rather go to Magic Noodle, which also has a far larger menu selection."}
{"text":"My Spicy Cold Noodle ($7.99) was really good. Savory, Sour and Spicy at the same time.  It took me 5 minute to eat my noodle but 30 minute for it to be ready.  On a Saturday afternoon, the wait staff and the kitchen seemed to be overwhelm with a full house.   If you are in a rush, don't come here. The only items that can be serve fast is their congee and cold dish. Since a lot of the item is made when order, it might take my whole lunch break to be ready... I almost just walked out without eating.."}
{"text":"This is a pretty interesting place, hidden in a little plaza at the intersection of Brimley Rd. and Sheppard Ave. Menu items include congee (obviously) as well as handmade buns, noodles, fried rice, etc.   One of the highlights of this place is definitely the price. A decently sized bowl of congee (more than enough for one person, but maybe not enough for two) is only $0.99!! Buns, which are pretty big, are also $0.99! I had a bowl of the purple rice porridge and a chives and egg bun and was super full afterwards. My mom also got a bowl of the same congee and a preserved vegetable & pork bun, and our total bill ended up being less than $5 - can't find that kind of price anywhere else!  I thought the purple rice porridge was quite delicious, it had just a hint of sweetness. Would recommend trying it if you come here. I was initially afraid that my bun would be bland, but it was actually quite flavourful, if not just the tiiiniest bit too salty for my taste. Preserved vegetable & pork bun was also quite strong in flavour, my mom thought it was too sour, but I'm sure plenty of other people would enjoy it (my family just tends to prefer lighter flavours.)  While you are eating, you can watch a lady make buns. She goes through the entire process of preparing the dough and stuffing the buns, which I thought was pretty cool!  I wanted to give this 4 stars initially, but chose to take one star off because unfortunately my mom found what appeared to be a bug (mosquito?) squished on the bottom of her bun. D: I'm hoping it was just a one time thing, since my bun was fine, but still, can't pretend we didn't see it."}
{"text":"Let me just start off, the food is DELICIOUS.  each time I go there and order something, its really good.  However, one thing that's not good is the service.  They all seem to be unhappy, and they are rude.  If you want to go out for great food, come here, but for a place with a good and friendly staff, then don't go.  However, they are fast, which is good."}
{"text":"The noodles here are really good. I ordered the lamb one, and there were both an ample portion of lamb and noodles. The buns are cheap (about a dollar), but the consistency of quality is weird. The first time I had it, the bun was very flavourful and tasty. The second time, it had a bitter aftertaste. I was worried it had gone bad or something (but I wasn't sick after, so maybe it was just that one bun). Although I don't think this is on the main menu, this place does sell skewers for about a dollar as well. I would not recommend them as the skewers are very tiny.   Service is okay. They have a TV that has Chinese shows on it, but I don't really pay attention to that. If you're looking for a cheap eat, this is the place."}
{"text":"i have mixed feelings about this place...   they seem to kind of incorporate a fusion of foods.. they have very northern china dishes.. and then they would have very southern cantonese style dishes...  the dishes are confusing.. for example.. i got the lamb soulder it was fried and covered with spices.. very very heavy on the cumin.. which is totally northern chinese.. and i was mixing it with preserved eggs with congee and noodles and other dishes you may see at congee wong or keungs..  the portions were smaller than i expected.. the pictures look bigger than what it was... but tasted overall not bad... the pumpkin and multiwheat or whatever it is.. congee has no salt at all.. its pretty much plain congee.   interesting little place.  fresh buns were not bad too.."}
{"text":"Hm... i am thinking that to qualify to work at Congee Me, one must need to be really good at putting on a bitch face.  I don't mean to be rude about this, but really... no one cracked a smile.  Perhaps they had a competition to see who could scowl the most.  If that's the case, it would be hard to pick a winner.  My friends and i were given a piece of paper to write down our orders.  After we finalized what we wanted, we gave the paper to the waitress.  She looked at it and rudely told us to rewrite everything in Chinese.  Luckily we had a friend there who was fluent in Chinese and he graciously obliged. We ordered 4 bowls of congee, a vegetable as well as a chicken dish.  Everything was delivered quickly.  The waitress, however, brought 2 extra dishes that we didn't order.  When we told her about it, she literally talked back and insisted that we did.  After a bit, we referred back to the piece of paper to let her see our orders.  She argued that they were written down, but we told her that those dishes written in English were the same in Chinese.  She then blamed us for using the 2 languages to confuse the orders.  We had to tell her that it was her who insisted on us rewriting in Chinese.  Not our problem!!! The food tasted really good but the dishes were small.  So my friend decided to order another bowl of vegetable congee.  What she gave him was a bowl of meat congee.   For all that food, we each had to pay only $6.  That's the good part of the meal experience. I would go back for the food, but at the same time, it's intimidating to deal with those warrior-like staff in the restaurant."}
