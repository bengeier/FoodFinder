{"text":"Great taste for a dish on the bottom of the 3rd page. The name was too long to remember."}
{"text":"LOL. How to describe this place.  I was wandering around Montreal with a friend, and we decided that we were really hungry. It wasn't quite dinner-time, so we thought that we'd share a paella, wander around some more, the get the real dinner.  When we entered the completely empty restaurant, there was a dude, clearly a staff, chilling in the corner. He ignored us, we stood awkwardly for about 5 minutes, when another dude (probably the owner) came out of the kitchen, and directed us to a table.  We asked him how big a typical paella was. He indicated with his hands, \"Pretty big.\" So we ordered one paella and one appetizer to share. Then he told us that actually, no, the paellas are very small, and we would never be full with just one paella. We told him that it was just a snack (pointing out that it was barely 4pm). Then he told us that the paella that we chose wasn't as good as this other paella that he would like to recommend to us. He of course pointed to the most expensive paella on the menu, but oh boy, were we onto you!  We declined his recommendation, at which point he continued to press various other appetizers on us. We declined all of them (go us!), at which point he sulked into the kitchen.  The bread that came with the meal was cold and greasy, the appetizer (garlic shrimp) was pretty good, but then the paella was disastrous. The mussels in the paella weren't cleaned properly, and I could see the beard hanging off of them. Gross! The flavours were so bland and we were both disappointed. We ended up leaving more than half the food on the \"tiny\" paella. When we were done, the owner-dude came with a big fake condescending smile, asking if we would like the dessert, and that he would give it to us for free.  There was something very untrustworthy about it, so we declined, paid and got out of there as soon as possible. That was definitely new but not an experience that I'd like to repeat!"}
{"text":"Amazing Paella. We ordered it with shrimp, scallops, and lobster. One of the yummiest dishes I've ever had (I felt bad for the lobster though; it waved at me on its way to the kitchen).  The service is fast and the staff are very friendly. The place is small and cozy, you can barely notice it walking down the street, but is worth a visit. Will definitely return if I can."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner while in Montreal.  The paella was amazing, the Sangria was some of the best I have had, and it was paired with AMAZING service.  I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Three stars for food, but an extra star because of how well they accommodated our large (30+) group.   The food is a-ok. We had a prearranged group menu that was simple but still had options to accommodate most people. We started with a choice of soup or salad.  I choose soup, it was a basic cream of broccoli, but nonetheless delicious. For mains we had the choice of a few different paellas. I choose the seafood and paella one. Unfortunately the seafood tasted like average frozen stuff, not terrible but not amazing. The chicken was really great, a nice surprise. We shared some sangria, and its still up for debate as to what the alcohol content was, but it was sweet and tasty, that's for sure.   The service was great! It isn't easy dealing with such a huge group but the staff did a great job! From taking down the orders and then not having any problems getting the right item to the right person, to getting the food out to the whole group more or less at the same time, they made it work! The restaurant isn't huge, it's a long and narrow room, so they set us up towards the back and apart from a few tables right at the front that weren't with our group, we had the place to ourselves. Lots of room for us to get up and mingle.   I'm tempted to go back sometime and test out the food in a non group setting."}
{"text":"We were looking for a good fresh seafood place(july) and decided to go to El Gitano because of all the people raving about their paella. The rice was amazing but unfortunately the seafood smelled like ammonia (meaning that it wasnt fresh) and had a very dry chewy texture. The service was good but for the price you pay (from 30 to 40cad for paellas) its not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good, as was the service and live flamenco guitarist.   We got the three meats and seafood paella. The rice was good although a bit under seasoned for my taste. The meat dish was good. I really liked the rabbit, or so I think it was rabbit that I had.   The appetizer was hearts of palm was delicious. I loved the mayo sauce. The octopus was also well made- not rubbery at all and had great flavor."}
{"text":"A distinctly pleasant dining experience several blocks from our hotel in Montreal. Wait staff efficient, competent, and nice. The food was excellent. The paella was robust and ample. Very well seasoned gazpacho, surprising for May, and the dessert of strawberries, cream, and black pepper was flavorful."}
{"text":"Came here because paella seemed to be well reviewed.  A lot of choices as other reviewers have said.  Paella was indeed good though a bit saltier than I'd like. Lots of meat and seafood on my plate and a good amount of rice.The biggest shrimp that I've seen in a couple of years - almost a lobster.  Very quiet.  One of 2 diners on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"Highly recommend paella. But lobster is not so good. Maybe because it is not the right season."}
{"text":"This is the place for Paella !  A few words about Paella; This dish is fairly simple to prepare and the results are often mediocre. I look for a subtle safron flavor and lots of  fish and meats that are not dried out when served. Most of the time you get a lot of rice and not much else. El Gitano does their paella very well. The seafood paella was generously portioned with lots of clams, mussels, shrimp,and fish. The best part was that it was around $30 including a soup or salad, dessert and a glass of wine as part of a Christmas promotion. HEY RESTAURANT OWNER you should do this all the time! Apparently they offer flamenco dancers on the week-end so it looks like a fun place as well."}
{"text":"Don't like this place at all. I ordered the lobster one, for some reason that didn't taste so good. The lobster didn't taste fresh also. Won't go back"}
{"text":"Went here on a whim, and glad we did!  They specialize in Paella here and have at least a dozen to choose from, ranging from vegetarian to the most extravagant.  Super Bock available by the bottle (always a plus) as well as a pretty solid sangria by the liter.  Bread and olives were brought out right after our order and the server was very helpful in deciding/organizing a shared meal for 5 people.    We wanted the grilled octopus, but they didn't have enough, so they gave us a small plate for free and suggested the calamari instead.  Octopus was very tender, although the flavor was a little different than expected.  Calamari was good, but nothing to write home about.  We ordered the vegetarian, 3 meat, and \"de la casa\" paella's.  Both non-vege's came with ample portions of meat and seafood, by no means a majority of rice.  All the seafood (scallops, muscles, shrimp, lobster) was cooked very well, all very tender and flavorful.  The lamb was good and rabbit very well and deliciously prepared.  The chicken was OK, but more on the dry side.  All in all, I would definitely consider returning for more!  The 3 paella's easily fed all 5 of us and we split 3 desserts (chocolate mousse, fruit salad, and coffee cake) with ample satisfaction.  They have flamenco dancing (on a small stage in the restaurant) each Saturday (possibly Sunday) and accept American Express, as well as other credit cards.    A welcome change to the standard rotation of various restaurants available in the area, this cozy nook is definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"The paella was as good as the one I had in Barcelona. I shared one pan of paella with a girl friend because we were not hungry. I think having one paella will make you very full and no room for dessert. We had snails as appetizer and a paella with octopus in (price:around 30$).The price include a soup or salad, dessert and coffee.  The octopus was divine. Never had anything like that.   Will come back on a Saturday night to see the flamingo perfermance."}
{"text":"Really good food and great service.  The place has a nice decor to enjoy with friends or family. We had the seafood Paella which was amazing."}
{"text":"My bff wanted some Spanish food so we went to El Gitano for paella, we both liked it but I have to admit that I prefer rice without flavor. The taste was good overall and recommended to everyone!"}
