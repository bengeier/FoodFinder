{"text":"I have been living in Point St. Charles for more than an year and have just recently discovered this amazing place. All the food that I have tried here is awesome and fresh. If you are a broke student, this place is heaven. Each dish is very very reasonably priced at $5 and, given the quality of the food, it really is a bargain. 

As others have already mentioned, this is a takeout place. The interiors might be intimidating at first but do no justice to the food that is served. I was apprehensive at first but now am a changed man. Do give this place a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Very quick for take out. cheap too for the food. I'll definitely be going back. Previous comments were useful and I agree with them too."}
{"text":"Great food, unbelievably affordable prices. The menu consists of pictures on the wall and the dishes are 5$ each, taxes included. The owners are pleasant, speaking broken franglais. I had the Pad Saw and my mother the Pad Thai combo with spring roll, nicely fragranced won ton soup and a cold soft drink (7$ for the combo). Everything was fresh and tasty and served in no time. There are two half booths available for seating, so a total of four places.
Looking forward trying the Tom Yum soup and their homemade dumplings.
Wouldn't recommend the General Tao chicken which is too heavy on the ketchup."}
{"text":"This place is not closed. The owner had a month of vacation in the summer, maybe that's why people get the impression that it is closed. Their food is as good as before and at the low price."}
{"text":"This little place in the heart of Pointe Saint Charles defines the term hole in the wall and I use this term in the most positive way. This little takeout counter offers and incredible price to quality ratio, this is why I think it deserves four stars. 

Where else can you find a generous portion of home made Pad Thai for only five dollars or even a combo plate for only seven dollars. I haven't tried them but the soup dumpling are suppose to very good as well

This place is really a take out counter even if it has a few booths for you to eat in, this really isn't a place you want to eat. Don't get me wrong the kitchen is clean and the owner is a wonderful cook but this old depanneur was never meant to be a restaurant and the wooden benches don't look that comfortable.

If you're looking for a good neighbourhood Asian take out place give this place a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh What can I say about this place!! I moved here and I always thought this place was abandoned, until one day I saw a sign!! 5$ menu, brought to you by someone who clearly doesn't speak French or English. You must point at the menu board, he will not start cooking until you pay first!

Whatever you point to you wont be disappointed, the food is great. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
