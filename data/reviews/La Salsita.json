{"text":"This is the best of the fast-foody-type Mexican places (like all the -bertos, Amado's, Vaqueros, et cetera), and in fact I say the only one worth even visiting. It's definitely authentic; not healthy by any stretch, but authentic. They do indeed make things like tortillas and masa right in front of you, and you can tell it's a small family operation as there's an older lady and I guess her older husband in there all the time (as opposed to the young brats who \"run\" most of the -bertos). If you're looking for a guilty pleasure,  especially late at night, THIS is the place to go.  Also, I've been to other Salsita's around town and they're comparable, but not quite as good as this one. (On 32nd)"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. My favorite neighborhood Mexican place. Excellent food, always super fresh. The establishment is very comfortable and clean. I am always pleasantly surprised with how good the food is. The staff is always willing to listen and get you what you need! Very authentic and pleasant."}
{"text":"I just got done wolfing down a chili relleno burrito...that  was so AMAZING I looked here to see what everyone else thought but was shocked to see I am the 1st to review here! According to the bag my food was in there are 10 locations.  I guess that makes it a franchise, nonetheless it's killer. You know how you order something and it's a bigger portion than you expected and you think there's no way I can eat this much- but then take a bite and it's so good you just end up eating way more than your body is prepared for? That's how delicious it was.  Since I am new to this area, I listen when someone recommends a place to go do -well just about anything.  I am also big on trying to take the source of the referral into consideration. But in this case, pretty much everyone I've met has told me how great this place is..I decided to check it out and grabbed some dinner on my way home.  Instead of hitting one of the many corporate franchise drive thrus on the way home I went to theirs.. I didn't see what I wanted on the menu so I asked if they had it. The guy said yes they do and then handed me a white bag about 1.5 min later.  I don't know if it was cream cheese or some kind of Cojita Cheese but whatever they stuffed the pepper with it was super tasty! They also put Lettuce, Onions, Some enchilada sauce, and cilantro in the burritos!! My stomach is so full right now I have to lay down after I write this!! Parking is no problem. They have a drive thru! YES-it's a little on the worn out side- but they do have one! Open 24hrs. They have fresh juice, horchata and tamarind drinks"}
{"text":"La Salsitas...32nd St & Indian School. This is hands down some of the best Mexican food in the Valley. A quiet little place minding their own business doing what they know how to do. This is a must-visit quaint restaurant. If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, this is the place to hit. Totally Six Stars...this place gets Best Mex In The 'Hood!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious , I am very picky with Mexican food and have been let down at different Mexican places ,filibertos, juliobertos, tee pee, the list goes on. But this place is authentic and fresh. The meat is always cooked great with no weird pieces of fat in it. Fresh ingredients and affordable. It's very clean and the staff is so friendly. When I don't feel like cooking at home I go here for a taste of my grandmas cooking."}
{"text":"I ordered a Caldo de Res just to be told they were out just right after I paid for it. The cashier offered me another item which was almost 5 dollars more. I said no and she didn't even offer to give it to me for the same price since it wasn't my fault! I ended up ordering something else because I was hungry. And by the way, No one here says Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Listen, folks.  Maybe I'm just another gringa who can habla enough espanol to properly order from this place, but I friggin' love this place.  And yes, I only order two things, the Carne Asada Nachos and the Carne Asada Torta, so perhaps my 5 stars won't cover all of Salsitas offerings, but damn, love it, love them.  Here's why...  They make the chips fresh, as in made-to-order, literally cutting up the uncooked corn tortillas and frying them right after you order, making them warm and crispy and delicioso.  Whatever combination of goodness it is that is then placed on top of the chips is amazing.  There's beens, guacamole, fresh pico de gallo, sour cream, jalepenos, carne, grated cheese that is melted by the piping hot chips, and I'm sure I'm missing something, but the culmination of these ingredients result in a flavor fiesta!  The torta is a mess to eat if you unwrap it, but inside is a toasty bun of some type of bread the likes of which cannot be purchased at Gringo-Mart, holding together layers of beans, some sort of white Hispanic moisty cheesy goodness, tomato, lettuce, onion, carne, jalepeno and cheese.    Can you tell I ate there last night?  That's the only reason I'm not gnawing on my mousepad as I type this.  Go there!  Vamanos!"}
{"text":"Amazing AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Employees are happy to help if you have any questions. Price is relatively inexpensive and you get a huge quantity. The tongue and tripe tacos are delicious! And the Chicharron en salsa rojo was delicious! The churros and white milky drink (can't remember what it was called) are also great! Would come back everyday if I could! Great salsa bar selection too!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times all good experiences except for today's wait. 50 mins in line was not acceptable after somehow forgetting what out order was by the time we finally got to the window. Hopefully your experience  won't be like mine."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Mexican fast food place in town! I've never been disappointed and food taste better each time. There's a little wait sometimes but it's well worth it. Their salsa is amazing, same with their shredded beef tacos and horchata."}
{"text":"Awesome carnitas, lengua and adobada  tacos! The flavors were delicious. I'll be back for another round."}
{"text":"Don't you dare hit up Filiberto's or Julioberto's ever again in your Mexican food life. This is the authentic shit. Pollo Asado is what dreams are made of.  Again, who cares about the exterior and crappy intercom system in drive thru? That's all part of the experience; you're lucky if a homeless man hits you up while you're waiting for your burrito baby.  I've never been inside...one can only hope it sparkles more than the outside, but whatever! Those tortillas and freshly cooked chicken make up for anything that may seem sketch. Oh, and the staff is perfection!"}
{"text":"I went to this place at lunch to buy a carne asada burrito and asked what they put on it, I was told Carne, Pico de Gallo, Rice, Guacamole and beans which I reply if I could get mine without Rice after getting back to my work I found out that I was given a burrito with nothing but carne and beans. I called to informed them and was told that in order for them to exchange I would need to take it back for them to add the other ingredients (not enough time left at lunch to do this) and was told too bad nothing they can do.  If I could give this place a ZERO I would, last time I eat here."}
{"text":"OK- this is really your typical \"hole in the wall\" so if your looking for ambience this isn't the place- FYI the newer location up the road on Main just after Stapley is a little nicer and has better seating. BUT if you are looking for some place with cheap, decent food, open 24 hours, that's way better than a Filiberto's or a bunch of other \"berto's\" -stop in.  The tortillas are homemade and they will customize your order ie. combining the sauces for the camarones al diablo (shrimp devil-style/spicy) and the camarones al ajo (shrimp w/garlic). I also really like that everything comes with grilled onions that are the bomb! For a cheap lunch I'll order their street tacos ($1.25) and I'll get a cabeza taco and a carne asada taco and combine the two and add the grilled onions. The cabeza can be kind of fatty but I haven't found any place here where it isn't. More FYI- sometimes they forget about the grilled onions so you have to ask plus the Stapley n Main location has complimentary homemade Charro beans next to the salsa bar. I'm personally not a big bean eater, but I've tried them and they are pretty good depending on the day."}
{"text":"Out here for work from WA state and thought I'd come check the place out. This place is legit. Had the carne asada and carnitas plate. Great authentic taste. Family run business( literally) they have mom and aunts cooking up your food In the back. This is the real deal. Stop in and see Tesa. She'll take care of you. Definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I went to the one off of 43rd and McDowell 9/28/2013 around 1:50 am.  The place was a little grungy, but I didn't care too much b/c I was taking it to go.  Anyhow, I got rolled tacos with guacamole and a cheese quesadilla.  The quesadilla was as expected.  The rolled tacos were not very good at all.  They were mostly taco material with very, very little meat.  I've never seen a rolled taco with so little meat in my life.  Also, the guacamole they use is cut with sour creme or something, probably to save cost b/c avocados can be expensive, it made the guacamole taste gross.  There are so many other quick Mexican joints out there besides this one.  I would skip this place and chose somewhere else,... Hell, even Taco Bell would have been better."}
{"text":"La Salsita? It IS SALSITAS... Awesome find, hope you try it! Conveniently OPEN 24/7, great food, nice people. They have a great variety for customizing your burritos, they don't nickel & dime you - like for adding guacamole to your burrito for example. In fact, they even have a guacamole sauce with their salsas & fresh lemons & sliced radish/salad  condiments you can serve yourself. You get your fresh horchata or colada from a separate server on the side. They also have Sangria & many other bottled drinks. They have quite a few tempting deserts, flan & fresh fruit t & fried treats but I've always been too full to even finish a burrito! They are very generous proportions & they have great chile relleno's!!! (Hey a good relleno ain't easy!) They aren't the cheapest, but worth the price. If you want cheap, stick to bean & cheese, or taco's either way it's real food & you'll get plenty. SO why it's not 5 stars... It's kinda funky for sit-in, but there's a drive through. If you habla espagnol it may be easier, if not as entertaining. I've ended up buying two of something a couple of times, & tried a couple surprises; if you really want to be sure it's done a certian way it's best to go inside & watching them put it together through the glass is pretty cool too. Even when you get just what you ordered, it seems there's always extra food - Oh, well, it makes great leftovers!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It is fresh, made-to-order traditional Mexican food that you can either get to go at the drive-thru or as dine in at the counter. It seems to be run by a single family and the customer service is always great. The food is consistently good and well-priced. Don't judge it from the outside appearance, this food is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Excellent pastor tacos.  If you want quick and authentic street tacos it's here.  They were out of chorizo for breakfast burritos, so that was a bummer.  Otherwise perfect taco shop stop"}
{"text":"The \"street tacos\" here are outstanding.  Consistent quality w/ a hot sauce bar that apologizes to no one.  Friendly staff.  Hear me now, believe me later.  Strong."}
{"text":"Way better food than any of those blah blah blah-Berto's places at still fantastic prices. Some if our favorites are: shredded beef chimichanga, California burrito, breakfast burrito, and any of the aguas frescas. The tortillas always taste fresh and the salsas are full of flavor."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 tripas tacos, a carne asada burrito, and a pina colada.  Hit up the salsa bar which is always nice and free.  The pina colada was sweet, refreshing, and tasted great.  5 minutes later the woman brought me out my food.   The tripas tacos were pretty good.  The tripas could have been a slight bit crunchier but they were generous with the toppings and meat.  The carne asada burrito was very middle of the road.  I've had much better and much worse.  I remember when those burritos were absolutely delicious.  I think the proportions have gotten smaller, and the quality of the ingredients has gotten weaker.  Oh well, needless to say I couldnt finish all of the burrito and didnt really feel bad tossing the rest of it.  If you've been to a Salsitas before this one is exactly how the rest of them are.  If you haven't been to one before it may be worth a try.  You never know what you may like."}
{"text":"I came for lunch at this location to get a burrito..i paid 7.75c, when i got my order my burrito was as small as a 99 breakfast burrito from mcdonals. I notice this when i got back to work.. i called this location and some one answer the phone i told him on the problem and he stated they didn't have burrito tortilla that's why they were making it in that size...i told them i wanted my money back and he said hold on and left me in the phone for long time..i hang up and drove to the store to go get my money...bottom line if they don't have the product to let customer know not just give the customer something its not worth the price your paying for...."}
{"text":"Great food for a little hole in the wall restaurant.  I've been here several times and the only complaint I have is about their condiments.  They're all in open containers with no lids or sneeze guards and I don't know if the customer before me sneezed on them. Do you?"}
{"text":"I just went here with my daughter.  It got good reviews from everyone, so figured I would give it a try.  I was especially excited when I heard it had a good chili rellano burrito.   So that's what I got, and Megan got a carne asada quesadilla.  First, the help.  I stood there for at least 3 minutes, no one at the counter, and the people in the back just looked at me.  Finally, someone came up to help me.  Towards the end of my order, her personal cell phone rang.  And I kid you not, while she was waiting on a customer, she answered it and began to talk.  I couldn't believe it.  But I figured if the food was good, we would give it a try anyway.  So we went to find a table.  We sat down and I was afraid the wobbly chair under me was going to collapse.  I moved twice before I felt comfortable.  That's a lawsuit waiting to happen.   In the meantime, helped myself to the salsa bar, which isn't bad, give that 3 stars.  The food came out in a timely manner.  My chili rellano burrito had rice in it.  Now, I don't like rice in my burritos, but that's also easy to overlook.  But the rice had PEAS in it.  I kid you not, PEAS, and lots of them.  I hate peas, hate them.  So as I begin to eat, I picked them out, one by one.  The egg coating on the rellano seemed like it was hours old, it was spongy, greasy,  so peeled most of that off too.  And it was very hot, obviously had been heated up in a microwave.    Megan's carne asada quesadilla wasn't too bad, but the meat also seemed like it had been sitting around for quite a while.  All in all, a horrible experience.  There's a Taco Bell right next door.  I would have preferred that, any day of the week.  Needless to say, someone could buy my dinner for me and I wouldn't go back to this nasty ass place.  Rude front counter people, old nasty food, and chairs in the dining room that are ready to collapse.  It was clean...I guess that's something."}
{"text":"The food was good but we waited 25 minutes, in the drive thru, for 2 enchiladas and a tostada.  They were a little disorganized.  The girl at the window didn't know that another employee had taken our order and collected or money.  We gave them a good tip mostly because we likely won't be going back there ever again."}
{"text":"I love hole in the wall places, however there is still a level of cleanliness expected. This place needs better ventilation and better customer service. The young girl who took our order messed up two times in a row. The cook came out and told us our shrimp order would take long because he had no sauce made. I might as well have gone into a Mexican restaurant rather than fast food. Their salads bar was limited. They had red and green and that was pretty much it."}
{"text":"I know I'm kind of generous with the stars, because Yelp won't let me knock off half of a star  (yes I'm one of those people, its all about the pluses and minuses) for something silly, like, oh, the garish colors (which I find completely charming), some crumbs on a bench I'm about to sit on, or the fact that I can't understand Spanish that well through a drive through microphone, especially when my mouth is watering and my eyes are glazing over trying to read the menu and look at the cool pictures of food at the same time.  Finally they manage to tell me to drive around to the window, and I do.   In my pathetic Spanish I try to speak to the sweet man at the window, and the preteen lady with him smiles indulgently at me and translates.  After a bit of cooking time, accompanied by occasional cheery nodding and smiling at me, (do they think I'm going to drive off confused because I'm not sure what I ordered?)  I get this bag of food and put it next to me for the short drive home.  I open a styrofoam container of al pastor platter, the pork is all I hoped for, the rice I don't care, the beans are fine, oozy with that nice white cheese, I don't care, there's even a little baggie with 4 fresh lemon wedges, under $8. I scarf the lettuce and tomatoes and luscous meat and decide this is my new favorite drive-through, but I've got to remember to order some quacamole next time.  I went back a few days later and ventured inside with some out of town guests.  I had four of the assorted tacos, geez this menu is big, I want everything.  My friends had others and we agreed this place is a gem.  Personally, I'm a huge fan of immigration and feel deeply grateful to people who leave their homelands to come and make food like this for me."}
{"text":"The food is great. Salsitas has great good at a great value. I just ordered 3 tacos, but I would of been fine with just two since they are a good size and are well served. I haven't tried the burritos yet because they are way too big. They make their own tortillas right in front of you. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the location is in poor condition, clean but in need of an upgrade. They have great Aguas frescas."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years now and their carne asada tacos and bomb. And I thought they were called Salsitas.."}
{"text":"Thank you Hortencia for the amazing chili relleno on the house! The sauce was amazing now that is how a chile relleno's made just like my grandma's. LOVE the carne asada street tacos w HOMEMADE corn masa yum!!!"}
{"text":"Best fast food Mexican in the area. Authentic and tasty. The service is friendly and it takes a few minutes for them to prepare your food but worth it."}
{"text":"Looks aren't everything.......  This little divito looks a little scary looking, but like I've said before \"you can't judge a book by it's cover\".   Not necessarily the kind of place you will take your date (unless she's blind and hungry), but man oh man is the food ever good!   We have ordered breakfast, lunch, & dinner, and it is all fantastico. They make home-made corn tortillas and several salsas. The breakfast burritos are out of this world and cost about the same as a McDonald's meal.   We are a family that eats out frequently and we are frankly tired of pretty places with below average food. This place is sure to cure your hankerin for a tasty Mexican meal."}
{"text":"I would love to give this little Mexican restaurant a great review, but the rude staff prevents me. Great salsas, delicious verde, amazing chile rojo and fantastic homemade corn tortillas.    But, we were completely ignored -when we walked in and stood at the counter to order (the place was empty-it was about 3pm)-when the female employee finally 'noticed' us, she was extremely rude-it really seemed as if we were not welcome.   Excellent food but we'll never go there again."}
{"text":"This place seems to me like the kind of restaurant that doesn't care about yelp reviews; but, I'm going to write one anyway for the unsuspecting traveler or for the person who works in the area and is willing to try something new. When I rolled through the drive through and made my way to the speaker, the first words out of the mouth of the person inside were in Spanish. Luckily I do speak Spanish so a crisis was averted there.   I ordered a carne asada burrito with everything. Cost: $7.00. A little steep especially when I got back to my office and discovered after the first bite, that, in my opinion, the meat was more like beef jerky. To me, the meat was hard, tough, and my teeth hurt after gnawing on it for a while.   Part of the problem is that I myself am really good at making carne asada at home. I use the best thinly cut chuck steak or diezmillo I can find. I season the meat, and grill it over mesquite charcoal mixed in with some hickory wood. Add to that all the freshly made extras and you have one of the best carne asada tacos or burritos you've ever tasted - or so I'm told. I will admit they are pretty good and unfortunately for La Salsita on 32nd and Indian School, it just doesn't measure up.     Before I totally pan a restaurant though, I will go back maybe one more time. I do believe in second chances. If I get another serving of teeth-busting meat, I will know for sure that this is one place to stay away from."}
{"text":"For a place open late and those who don't mind Mexican food at any hour I can't think of another place to go eat at 3AM. They have a good selection and prices are decent. I had their tacos de al pastor which is my go to meal when I'm trying out a new taqueria and they were good. Definitely worth checking out especially after drinking all night... really hits the spot."}
{"text":"Tacos are awesome. Tons of different meats & salsa to choose from. The best Piña Colada drink I've ever had!!! It's a hole in the wall, but my favorite place to get tacos in Phoenix and they also had tripas that was crispy good."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to our condo. For 1.25 tacos and their Carne Asada tacos aren't like ground beef with no extra weird stuff on it I'm almost in love. Definitely not my favorite place for Carne Asada tacos but definitely not my least favorite.  We will see you again soon my friend.  Oh a word of caution.  My boyfriend ordered a pollo asado burrito with beans cheese sour cream and rice and asked for the enchilada sauce to be put in the inside of the burrito and its always the same result....outside as usual. We need to Learn how to speak Spanish so we can get it right everytime :("}
{"text":"I'm typically not a huge fan of these fast food Mexican food places, as there are tons of 5-star Mexican food restaurants, street cars, etc in Arizona, but every time i've gone to Salsitas i've been really happy with not just their food, but their prices and selection.  First off, the prices are a little cheaper than what you'd expect from a fast food places.  $2.99 for a egg, potato and cheese burrito, which includes a side salad if you sit inside, is really hard to beat.  Next is one of the most important parts of a Mexican food place: the salsa bar.  Salsitas has a great salad bar which includes both red and green salsa, a guacamole sauce, peppers, and those soft carrots.    The menu is almost too big as they have everything from tortas, enchiladas, desserts, aquas frescas, etc.   Don't come here expecting non-greasy, healthy Mexican food and complain when you get your delicious greasy burrito."}
{"text":"Went Sun: 3/17/13.  Food & drinks were terrible. (I've eaten at the Salsita on 67th & Thomas & that place has the best Tacos & drinks-5 stars) But this place on 43rd was awful. I ordered 3 tacos de cabeza. Tortillas were hard & cold & the meat looked more like lengua & it was just bad all the way around & my Jamaica drink tasted AWFUL with a bad after taste-chalky-Ewww! I didn't return my food but I just know NOT to EVER go back to this place again-Ever!  Find another Salsita...not this one.."}
{"text":"Rice was bland, guacamole is apparently salsa now? My burrito fell apart, canned beans....bland meal. Worst meal ever. Whoever said this was good mexican food, must have no taste buds. Never again"}
{"text":"Love this place. The 7seas soup is my favorite! Soooo good! They have one of the best carne asada tacos!"}
{"text":"i dunno man.   this place is practically walking distance from my house, but for some reason i've never made it here.  after reading all the good reviews, i figured i'd drive through for some late snacks.   first, the woman working the drive through didn't speak any english, so it took an unnecessarily long time to order.    next, i only ordered two things-a california burrito and a horchata. i paid with a card and she's didn't say how much the food was when i gave it to her.  when i got home i looked at the receipt and saw i was charged SIXTEEN DOLLARS for these two items! i didn't look at the cost of the burrito, but i did notice a large horchata was something like $3 on their menu.  no way that burrito could have cost $13, so i must have been charged for two. ugh!   after reading all the reviews about how ~amazing~ their aqua frescas are, i could not believe how awful the horchata was.  it was extremely watery and obviously made with a powder mix as i could taste the graininess in the drink.  the actual flavor was very weird as well, it didn't taste like any horchata i've ever had (and i've had a lot).   the california burrito was the saving grace and was actually really delicious.  unfortunately since the rest of the experience was so annoying and i was overcharged, i think i'm going to stick with bertos or vaquero for my late night fat snacks."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am a Southern Cali native, and I was spoiled with some fantastic burrito shops back home. So when I moved to AZ, I guess I just assumed that a state so close to Mexico ought to have some kick-ass burritos. WRONG! I tried a few places the first year I lived here and I was burned so many times, I just gave up.  So today I got a craving so I searched Yelp for the best rated burrito shop in my local area and I come across this place, \"La Salsita\".   So here are my opinions listed in order of appearance, the bad ones first.  1. 311 W. Main St is NOT LA SALSITA. They have moved a few doors up Country Club right next to Taco Bell. And it's called Salsita's.   2. It's right in front of a Motel 6, and there are a bunch of skeevy people hanging around the area.   3. It's tiny inside the restaurant.   4. You should probably be fluent in Spanish to order here.  5. They rung up my order wrong and didn't figure it out until they made the food, and I had to pay additional cash at the end. IMO, they should have eaten the cost, it was their mistake.   6. There were only 2 people ahead of me, it shouldn't have taken 20 minutes to get my order.   7. The lady making the burritos was throwing tortillas around on the same counter as the order receipts and people with long necklaces dangling in the food were hanging around the food prep area.  Ok, here's the good stuff.   1. It's in a convenient area of town.  2. You can watch them make the food right in front of you.   3. The food was pretty decent. I ordered a carne asada burrito with rice, beans and cheese. Meat was good, not dry and not greasy. They didn't add any junk that I didn't want. I did NOT get peas in my rice as some other poster noted.   Overall, I would recommend that people go when they're not in a hurry and just take it to go if you can. I would go back when I'm looking for something with a little more substance than Taco Bell."}
{"text":"And again, if I could give this dump no stars, I would. What a pit!  What a rip!  Night before last, I went to this joint, inside, no drive-through. All I wanted was a burrito, a simple beef burrito. Somehow, with rice and beans, the counter help said she wanted $12. For a burrito, rice and beans. Really?  Really.   I'm not paying $12 for a burrito, I don't care if there's rice and beans, I don't care if there's a salsa bar, or a pretty server, that's about triple what I expected to pay. So I walked across the street to Taco Bell, got a \"Cantina Burrito\" for $4 - DELICIOUS! !and I went home.    $12, eh?"}
{"text":"Yesterday morning a friend and I were craving a breakfast burrito and all the places nearby (downtown Phoenix) weren't open until 9 or 10am.  My friend suggested La Salsita since he's been to other locations and they rocked.  Found out this was the closest to us so we drove over.    The cashier didn't speak a lick of english and I don't speak much spanish so it was a bit interesting trying to order.  I was really surprised that she didn't speak any english (or at least pretended not to).  I was able to order our breakfast burritos and luckily they came out correct.  I know there is a heavy hispanic influence in this area but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person to ever go in here that doesn't speak spanish.    My chorizo burrito was fine, just had too much chorizo and no other flavors came through.  Would have been better with potatoes in it.  My friend had the steak breakfast burrito and he had one bite and spit it out, the steak was not steak and tasted like rat.  Soooo nasty!    There are so many great little local mexican restaurants nearby that taste better and easier to order."}
{"text":"I came to this place every Saturday for carne asada fries after work, I really love this place"}
{"text":"There is a gentleman at this place who makes the best carna asada fries and nachos late at night.  And for only $6 including tax, you cannot go wrong.  See photos.  He packs on the cheese, meat, and sour cream every time.  I just can't get enough.   Now as for the lady who makes them mostly during the day, she packs on the beans and pico de gallo instead of the cheese and sour cream.  This lady is really nice and she works there all day long.  She always has a beautiful smile.    So, you can have them one way during the day and another late at night.  Come try this place out, and you will be inviting all your friends to this spot.  Dining area open all the time."}
{"text":"This place is not bad for fast food Mexican food. Definitely beats Taco Bell. I had their carne asada nachos which were tasty but would been much better intoxicated. Heavy on the meat and beans. I paired it with their piña Aqua Fresca which was creamy and smooth. Must try once drunk!"}
{"text":"My mother in law found a piece of glass (looked like it was from a plate) in her food!! They didn't nothing about it! All they said was that the meat already comes cut and packaged and they don't know how it got in their. Proceeded to offer something else but after that just happen who would want to eat anything else from there ?!"}
{"text":"Do you love food poisoning and hate correct digestion? Then La Salsita is the place for you! Located conveniently next to the ghetto, this is the place where the employees like making you wait approximately 15 minutes for one taco! So stop by now and grab some tacos to poison your loved ones with!"}
{"text":"I just bought a home nearby this hidden gem and have been back several times since I moved in. The tortas are a go-to but honestly, everything I've ordered has been better than expected.  Even the simple bean burrito con queso is better than most places I've been.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was good up until today!! When did they start charging to use debit/CC? I've never been charged up until now! Now I have to not only pay for my food but also pay to use my card to pay for my food?? That is just ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"It's 3am on a Wednesday morning, and you can't walk straight. With a stomach that's only known a liquid diet for the last six hours, you tell your DD this will be much better than Jack in the Box. The night's been full of questionable decisions...one more couldn't hurt, right?  La Salsita has a nice array of different meats and veggies all ready to be loaded into a tortilla. If you want something quick like a burrito, it's like Chipotle for people who aren't afraid of Mexicans."}
{"text":"Have tried this place twice it is mediocre gave it two stars because I didn't throw it up. Not authentic or flavorful. Will not be giving it another chance."}
{"text":"The manager was really kind enough to let me know their wasn't any shrimp.we came at 11pm very late,the food was old of course.it was very good for a drunk munchies meal."}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food i have ever had i all ways order the nachos  mmmm the best and they all ways pile the food on i never have a naked nacho lol"}
{"text":"This little mexican joint has to have the best, mouth watering, orgasmic beef tongue tacos on the face of this planet.  My pastor introduced me to this place while my friend and I were starving in our little office ready to devour every thing we laid eyes on.  I ordered 6 beef tongue tacos and I tell you IT'S AMAZING!!  The tortillas are made fresh in front of your eyes and the tongue must of been braised for hours upon hours.  Because the meat just melts in your mouth.  Matter a fact get the burrito.  You'll get more meat and is cheaper.  With your burrito and tacos that you purchase you also receive a roasted onion and jalapeno.  On the side if you want more pickled jalapenos or carrots, radishes, amazing salsas, they're available.  If you truly want a delicious burrito drop by any, I think there are 8 locations in Phoenix?  Don't eat the Americanized chipotle junk.  This place blows chipotle out of the water."}
{"text":"One of the best quickie Mexican take-out joints in the valley for everything from simple carne asada tacos to chicharrones en salsa roja. I love that they have authentic, non-Americanized carne options like buche (pig intestines), tripas (beef intestines), lengua (tongue- best I've ever had), and cabeza (beef head). And you know what, each and every one of those weirdo meats are effing delicious. Cooked to perfection. Fall apart tender. Melt in your mouth delicious. So freaking good.  If they can make beef intestines taste delicious, you bet your ass their traditional meat options like carnitas and pollo are equally as delectable.   They make their own tortillas and both the flour and corn are tender and flavorful. You'll end up looking forward to that first and last tortilla-filled bite of a burrito, and you'll wish they doubled up their corn tortillas on the tacos. (And don't worry, you don't need a double banger tortilla on the taco. I've only had a corn tortilla disintegrate on me when I've left it to sit and sop up juices for ages.)  Make sure to take advantage of the salsa bar. Get lots and lots and lots of the aguacate sauce. That spicy green avocado sauce is the most amazing condiment. The red and green sauce will suffice in a pinch, but that bright green avocado sauce blows 'em away. The marinated carrots, cucumber slices and radishes are also spot on. Their strange pico with lots of cabbage is a concept I haven't seen anywhere else, but it's crazy complimentary. Give it a whirl.  The only issue I've ever had is with consistency. Sometimes a burrito will have rice and beans, other times it will be a meat-o-palooza. Not that big of a deal, and certainly nothing that will keep me away from the best quickie Mexican I've had in the valley."}
{"text":"Totally looks like a typical \"Bertos\"... but it's SO much better! Caritas was the bomb... the shredded beef had great flavor and the shrimp were fresh.  If you like flan, get theirs... it's delicious!!  Staff are very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite taco shop, u cant beat the prices with favors above parr, chorizo tacos are amazing as well as their pastor with enough options to satisfy everyones tastes."}
{"text":"My absolute FAVORITE Mexican food location in the ENTIRE valley. Most authentic you can get right here my friends. The best part, they make their tortillas fresh, yes. FRESH for every order.   I'm usually just a Carne Asada fan but their incheladas are amazing. My friend has had the lengua and machaca. All yum! Along with their chimichangas! They even do menudo and chili rieno to die for! This place reminds me of home.   3 Carne Asada tacos to go, please! With a Coke in a Bottle"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  First time I went, I got chicken street tacos and they were very good except that they use shredded chicken which is perhaps my 2nd favorite ... cudos for using white meat, though.  Also got a chicken chimichanga that I wasn't able to eat until later due to time constraints but when I was able to get to it (several hours later) it was still okay.  Second time I went, I got their carne asada platter and that was excellent.  The two best things:  they make their corn tortillas by hand on site and they are oh-so-fantastic, and their rice is so good I'm left wanting more (so I ordered more then second time).  So, why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?  I have a couple of facility issues with them.  First, the seating is that kind of bench attached to the table, so someone who is larger than average (as I am) is not comfortable sitting there.  Also, their ventilation system is fragmented and by that I mean, my first time I sat in a corner on a June night and was sweating profusely.  The best tables are in the middle of the dining room under the ceiling fans.  Now I know."}
{"text":"This is the place for street tacos. I always go for a few carne asada and mix it up with one of the other meats. The asada is great, but let's be real - the tortillas are the difference maker here. Add a healthy dose of that green sauce, and you got yourself a killer meal for $7. The joint is old school east Phx, and they use paper plates and such...but good god, who cares?   Long Live Salsitas"}
{"text":"This would have been a 4 star review, but my last visit was a mild disappointment--it seemed like the sauces were a bit runny and one dimensional. In general, everything there is pretty darned good!  the escamochas, the fish tacos, the bean burritos....  Don't be turned off by the dive building appearance.  Go get a lengua taco, they're yum!"}
{"text":"This place is only getting one star because of the food alone. This location by far has the worst customer service !! I went through the drive thru and there speaker doesn't even work they tell u just to pull forward . So when I pull up , the girl is rude and writes the order on her arm? ? I get home and they forget two burritos. So I call back and tell them and the girl that answered spoke no English (I speak both) but I would think they should have the person taking orders and answering the phones be able to speak English. So she passes the phone to someone else who says they didn't have the two burritos written down . Obviously not, she wrote it on her arm. They laughed and hung up. If you do go to the place, get off instead of going through the drive thru. But your better off going to Federico's across the street"}
{"text":"I haven't had the food but the agua frescas are amazing.  I had them two days in a row and would go back again and again and again.  The melon is amazing right now.  I went here in LA to get one at the farmers market and it didn't even compare.  I almost cried."}
