{"text":"Nouveau bar de quartier dans Villeray avec beaucoup de potentiel, mais qui malheureusement tombe à plat avec une sélection des bières et alcools plus qu'ordinaire. De plus, on sert à fort  prix la pinte Américaine de 16oz plutôt que la vraie pinte anglaise (ce qui est une insulte pour tout amateur de Guinness). Malgré tout, bonne ambiance et décor intéressant. À découvrir en groupe plutôt qu'en tête-à-tête."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, but the oysters and the beef tartare where really good! Also they have really good drinks (he had mojito, bloody ceasar, whisky sour). The vibe was nice and the waiters were also nice! :)"}
{"text":"Il est ouvert depuis 1 an, je me suis enfin décidé à l'essayer.  on retrouve des huîtres (en plateau, bien froides sauce cocktail, quartiers de citron, tabasco, ou avec garnitures telles que beurre d'herbes et vin blanc On retrouve quelques autres plats à partager, une carte de cocktails et une intéressante sélection de vins. Accompagnant quelqu'un allergique aux fruits de mer, je n'ai pas osé prendre autre chose que le gravlax de buf et sa purée d'oignon à la moutarde,"}
{"text":"Huis Clos is an excellent neighbourhood watering hole in Villeray! Villeray happens to be an excellent neighbourhood in which to go to a local watering hole -- so they very much go hand in hand! They've got some of the most innovative and sumptuous cocktails in the city; a tad pricey but very very much well worth it. The Moscow Mule is a beautiful drink with the perfect ratio of sweet to spicy; compliments to the Jamaican ginger beer they've incorporated. The Huis Clos N°75 is also amazing. It is a gin drink which uses the same ginger beer and it too is beyond delicious. What's beyond delicious, you ask? Well that's for me to know and for you to find out!! This place has ambiance out the wingwang! It has a sultry and mysterious darkness that makes it a wonderful place to unwind with friends and drinks. At Huis Clos you truly are 'behind closed doors' and if you're lucky enough you'll probably get to say hello to Jean-Paul Sartre. That eye he has isn't lazy by the way -- it's simply on an epic cinq à sept. Have fun!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! I've been there now at least 8-10 times and my food and drink has always been very pleasant! In fact, their food is excellent, considering they're mainly a bar. I've tried their pizza, lobster guedille, mozzarella salad, oysters, coquille st-jacques, a lamb dish, various tartares, etc and all were beautifully presented and tasty. We did have one small hiccup once when going with a smaller group, but if anything, the only small thing I can complain about would be the service here and there. I've never experienced rudeness, mind you, like some may have, but once or twice, it has been hard to get served promptly. It's not the norm, however. I also feel this place tries harder than many other places to get a crowd going: they have quiz nights every Monday (very fun, but don't go if you can't deal with noise), and some other special events. The manager?/owner who leads the quiz night is very nice and friendly as well. Of course, it helps that my favorite version of a whiskey sour can be found here: strong, tangy with a sweet kick at the end. I can drink these all day lol. Their other drinks are ok: the tiki drink I tried twice wasn't the best, felt too watery yet with strong amounts of alcohol. Prices are fair, and portions are generous. Just a simple yet fun place to go, with great music to boot!"}
{"text":"Beau petit bar de quartier, à l'allure design mais sympathique. J'avais été à l'ouverture et le service y était incroyablement lent, mais ils se sont largement rattrapés depuis.   Le choix des bières laisse vraiment à désirer (de bières de microbrasseries seraient VRAIMENT appréciées!), mais la carte des cocktails est plutôt impressionnante. Pour 10-12 $, on peut déguster des classiques mais aussi des créations de leur cru.   Les 5 huîtres à 8 $ entre 17 h et 20 h sont très appréciées, tout comme le menu des plus alléchants, mais un peu classique. Tartares de saumon et buf, hot-dog Ils en fument du bon, joue de buf, salades, mac and cheese, etc. J'ai pris les guédilles au homard car c'est la saison, et j'ai adoré! Avec avocats et salade de chou (dans le pain), c'était plutôt original.   En bref: la déco est vraiment mignonne, le service est bon, la sélection de bières bof-bof mais belle carte de cocktail! Menu correct.  Attention, ils ne prennent pas Interac!"}
{"text":"If a bar has a TV there's a 99% chance there's a hockey game on which means there is also a 99% chance I ain't into it. Let me note this was not always the case, as the behemoth screen was not there on my first visit. They installed a television. You are NOT a sports bar or a soccer bar for senior Portuguese men.  Huis Clos is one of the best bar choices in the area if not the top spot. The drinks were a bit overly sweet for my taste and the staff was friendly. The space is designed but not quite there. Good date spot (minus the TV)."}
{"text":"It's funny, just when I was thinking \"this area needs one more bar\" Huis Clos pops up. Sitting on the sunny side of St Denis, corner Villeray, and opened by the same crew that brought you Monsieur Smith out in HOMA, Huis Clos is most definitely welcome. It's a little on the edge of fancy for my taste, but with a nice selection of cocktails around the $10 range I am not mad at them. The Mojito and Ceasar were classic and strong, and the $22 charcuterie sharing plate was actually big and hearty and plenty for two people, with neat tastes like the pickled egg and vegetables, and the beet mustard.   The big backlit lettered sign with drink specials looks great and helps prevent the feeling of squinting at a chalkboard in a dim bar so popular around town. There's a sizeable booth in the back nearby windows into the kitchen, but the prime seat for me is right in the front in the setting sun, I'll be back earlier next time to try and slip into it. Service was slow but super friendly, I think they'll ramp right up into excellent."}
{"text":"Just what the neighborhood needed! A Habs game, three bloody caesars and a charcuterie plate later... I'm hooked! So happy this place is walking distance."}
{"text":"Maybe a 3.5 ?  It was nothing fancy, not a large choice of beers, a share plate of cheese with two good ones and a tasteless one, a really nice service.  I guess it's worth seeing another time, it was on a Friday night and it was not too noisy, so it's kind of a good thing to just hang out and have a chat."}
{"text":"We ate here last night at the end of a fun and very long birthday day for my boyfriend's 30th. We made a reservation at 8pm for 6-7 people. The gentleman who greeted us was super, the food was great, the drinks were creative and wonderful, and the music was so fun.   So- why just three stars? Well, I worked as a bartender and waitress in NYC, in Brooklyn, in Manhattan, at Marriott Marquis in Times Square View Lounge for over 15 years, and all with packed bars and houses. When you make a reservation, especially for a birthday at 8pm (which is a reasonable time...) you expect the kitchen staff to at least be there till you order dessert OR set aside dessert or I dunno, tell someone in the resto that okay I have to leave, BUT here are the desserts for the birthday party reservation and heat it up like this... AND I would expect at least one candle. The chef had left, the kitchen was closed and the waitress said they had no candles. I just think you need to be prepared if you are going to take a reservation for a bday, thats all.  Also she said something about not taking debit cards? Or else she is charged 5 dollars?? So despite the kinda wah wah service, as an ex waitress and NYer, I gave her FIVE extra dollars tip so she wouldn't have to pay the extra charge, if that is even a thing. I have never heard of it, but who knows.    So, in sum, the food is good, the atmosphere great, drinks great. They just need to up their service. Pay attention to details. That's all. They pay attention to great detail with their drink concessions (so good!), so it is important to be consistent, especially when you live in the hood, and will want to come back. cheers!"}
{"text":"Fantastic  ambience and service with Marc.  We tried this on a I love mtl deal, and it made for an amazing date night.  The charcuterie & cheese platter was delicious, likewise the oysters, and the beef tartare and ribs were awesome. Total win."}
{"text":"Découvert ce bar de quartier pour justement l'événement Yelp qui y été organisé. Bien aimé l'intérieur design, les prix ainsi que le service du personnel. Le tartare de saumon est délicieux. L'été, ils ont une petite terrasse sympa sur St-Denis. Un autre bel ajout dans Villeray. Bravo! J'y retournerai pour un autre 5@7. Wifi gratuit."}
{"text":"À l'occasion d'un événement Yelp, j'ai eu la chance de découvrir ce petit endroit installé dans un joli quartier accueillant. Malheureusement, je n'ai pu arriver à l'heure... mais j'ai pu prendre un verre avec mes compatriotes Yelpeurs/Yelpeuses. Ce n'est donc que partie remise ...  La prochaine fois ce sera pour de délicieuses huîtres !  On a Yelp event occasion, I had the chance to discover a nice little place in a nice little neighborhood. Unfortunately, I couldn't arrive on time at the event, and missed my chance to savor the speciality : oysters !!!!! Hmmmmmmmm ! It's only for a next time :-)"}
{"text":"You would never know that there was a cute bar hiding in this small corner of Villeray. I found the bar on Yelp and walked over. The bar itself is really cute and nicely decorated the bartender's weren't overly helpful, but they were fine. They had a DJ playing music behind the bar when I visited, which was fun to watch, especially because I was alone. The cocktail I had was fairly tasty. It was some kind of pineapple ginger concoction. They had a a list of good-looking specialty cocktails to choose from. The bar was busy especially for a weekday. I would recommend it if you're staying in the neighborhood, it definitely seemed more lively than other bars I visited."}
{"text":"Never, ever ever eva come here. Absolutely bad service and you will be lucky if the staff wants to work. My friend and I went in to order drinks for her birthday and we waited. After a few minutes, we could see the staff was screwing around and talking amongst themselves. My friend and I got up and went up to the bar and she started to wave at the bartenders. They clearly ignored her and when they finally came, they came up with the dumb excuse that they were closing a bill with a customer when they were clearly doing nothing. Since when do you need 3 people to close a bill? Not coming back"}
{"text":"J'aime bcp l'ambiance et la lumiere tamisée, exellent endroit pour une journee pluvieuse puisque c'est enfermée comme une taverne. Nos assiettes assez bonnes."}
