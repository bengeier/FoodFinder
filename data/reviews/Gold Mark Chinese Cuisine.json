{"text":"We went here for dinner on a Saturday and it was not a pleasant experience. The service was practically nonexistent; the servers ignored us most of the time and their attitudes were terrible. The food took a long time to come, and when it came, it was decent, but not worth the price. They stated that they would give us a 5 lb lobster, but they gave us two lobsters which are supposedly a combined 5 lbs, which is definitely not the same (both in quality and price).  We also ordered a dish where the tofu was sour. Overall, the decor was nice, but the food and service leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Worse customer service ever, the boss is so cheap he hired five waiters on a weekend. Mind you, this restaurant is big, the waiters were running back and forth like no tomorrow therefore service was horrible. Cant blame the waiters but got to blame the boss! The food was horrible as well! The eggtart were dry and cold. The har gaos were cold. Most of the food were not hot at all. Therefore i am never going here again.."}
{"text":"We went for dimsum about 10:30 am on a Thursday, got seated right away. The restaurant is about one third occupied. We didn't wait too long for our orders, about average waiting time, food was hot and above average. The dishes were all $3.10 each when ordered before 11:00am. With the exception of special and XL. Service was average for Chinese restaurant, I will eat there again."}
{"text":"My family came here for Chinese New Year. We had a reservation for 2 tables at 7:30, however when we got there, there were still people eating at the tables. We got one of the tables 10 minutes later, but we didn't get the other one until 8pm.

We ordered one of their CNY combos and the food took forever to come. The first dish (soup) came out at around 9pm (an hour after everyone got seated), and every dish after that came out in like 15-20 minute intervals. I looked around and saw many other tables waiting for their food as well. We asked an employee why it was taking so long, and she said they weren't able to wash all the dishes fast enough. 

The food itself was disappointing. They had really nice ingredients (like abalone, oyster, Norwegian salmon), but it was all prepared very poorly. For example, the Norwegian salmon dish was 12 salmon fillets but they decided to deep fry it and they only used salt as seasoning... The salmon was still moist but it barely had any flavour. 

Overall it was a bad experience, and the bill came to $500 per table."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family and it was pretty quiet on a Thursday evening. The boss (an old gentleman in super casual clothes) recommended the $68 meal which came with a standard soup, half portion chicken, a 1 lb garlic and ginger stir fried lobster, and a stir fried fish fillet on a bed of veggies.

Pros:
-the fish fillet: apparently it was a breed of wild caught fish whose texture resembled that of a sea bass, only fleshier

-service: one of the servers accidently dropped a fork into our soup, immediately apologized and brought us new soup to replace it (not very common in chinese restaurants)

Portion size: a 5 in terms of value for money, excellent sizes and well-priced for the combos with a good variety

Cons:
-the boss: he was muttering, berating and yelling at his staff in front of the customers (not sure that was necessary)"}

{"text":"Absolutely terrible restaurant!!  I was one of the guest who attended a wedding banquet on June 25, 2016.  Not to mention their lack of service, there was a green worm in one of my wedding banquet courses.  Yes!! A COOKED GREEN WORM!!  I immeidately asked to speak to the manager, who barely knows any English, and all they did was taking my dish away without an explanation or a apology what so ever..  I had a bad experience a couple of months back where I was there for dim sum (lunch).  The wait staff there was rude and unattending, as if they didn't wanted to be there.  The dim sum is bad, both in taste and look.  If it wasn't for my friend's wedding banquet, I wouldn't have went back.  I don't even know why my friend booked this place to begin with.

Poor service, bad food handling, terrible restaurant all around.  I posted a photo of the dish with the worm as a reference for all the diners visiting yelp."}
{"text":"The most ridicules and worst service from the owner from the start. Offer us a group of 7 a small table while there are bigger tables available and told us our three kids is not worth his money and not offering the bigger table to us.  I will not come to this Resturant ever again and will not recommend it to anyone who want to enjoy a dim sum meal with family. Worst ever"}
{"text":"Oh my.  This place is mildly awful.

Is it the dirty carpets, the fact that we had to wait 10 minutes for a tablecloth for our foldable card table, or the grains of old rice lumps stuck to all the dishware? 

My brother says it's the cold, bitter, dirty-water tasting tea that killed the experience for him.  For me, it was the fact that our tea had a whole bunch of chrysanthemum flower petals inside and stuck to the outsides of the teapot.  

What's the problem in that, you may ask? Well, it 
was a teapot that was supposed to be just hot water.  Also...we had jasmine tea. So where the heck did the petals come from?  I have creeping heebie-jeebies feels that says they very likely don't wash their teapots at all between guests. Ick. 

Oh, and the food was just as bad.  If you would like to know what their food tastes like, just go to your closest local Chinese grocery store, buy some frozen dim sum, microwave it...because that's exactly what it's like.  Except for the price point, because at Gold Mark you're going to fork over a not-too-low $4.99-$6.99 per dim sum dish.  Blech."}
{"text":"Seriously disappointing! We were in the area for servicing our car so went to this place to eat late in the afternoon about 3pm as we were very hungry. We were told that it's the last call for dumplings, which is fine, we ordered dumplings soon after , some entrees and rice. The fried rice came after 15mins and nothing else came even after 15 more mins. Then a guy came to us and asked for the payment  saying that the cashier has to go home. We told that we haven't got our food and would like to at least see the food(by that time I had already read the bad reviews in yelp). The guy was extremely rude and this is what he said \"if you are not happy , that is fine but our cashier has to go home so you have to make the payment. \" My husband and I were shocked. Anyway, we made the payment. After waiting for about 5-7 mins the dumplings started coming in, we just tasted the first round and they were so average. We were so pissed with the behaviour of the staff that we dint wait for the rest of the food and just walked out. Yes, this is the first time I had such an experience in  a restaurant in GTA so had to write a review. Very poor service."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5
Service: 1.5

This restaurant deserves at least 4.5 stars for food quality and taste! They have the right chefs in the kitchen, that much I can say. The dinner was good, and the dim sum was even better. Their tea was real and fresh. 

However, the service and attitude brings the overall rating down significantly. The wait staff are just following orders, so I place all the negative blame on the managers and organization of the business.

All the dim sum dishes came rushing out to the table within the span of 10-15 minutes, to the point where we couldn't fit everything and had to stack steamers and even consolidate plates! The staff can clearly see the amount of food we ordered on the menu and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to quickly estimate that not everything will fit all at once. So why not pace the food delivery accordingly? Rather, we were forced to chow down like pigs just to make table space fast enough for the oncoming dishes. This was very OFF in terms of what a real dim sum experience should be. Forget about talking!

While waiting for a special dish to arrive, the manager came to inform us that the price shown on the menu has been updated, to which he pulled out a pen, scratched off the price on the sheet and scribbled a higher price!!! How can you do that in front of a customer after they've already placed the order?! TERRIBLE!!

When we called for the bill at the end of the meal, the manager again informed us that a few of the special items we ordered have a special discount if we pay cash (ie: we are cheating the government on taxes if you pay cash). Again, TERRIBLE!! 

Aside from the great tasting food, this place needs some quick correctional action."}
{"text":"Decent dim sum during their discounted dim sum with all S/M/L dishes at $2.99 each (discounted dim sum is if you put in order before 11am). 

Some of my coworkers wanted to try dim sum so I brought them here on a Sunday morning bright and early to get a table. When we arrived at 9:30am, there were only a handful of tables left and it quickly filled up by 10 am.

We sampled quite a few of their dishes and I thought the portions were decent for the discounted dim sum. However, for the SP and XL dishes, they were quite expensive and not the best value. One downside to Gold Mark is that they do not have rice dishes during dim sum like other places."}
{"text":"Anyone like dim sum around here, cus I sure do!  Dim sum is just one of those things I love in huge quantities.  It's like when your little nephew gives you a high five or the Maple Leafs win a game (which unfortunately never happens), you just can't get enough of it!  The only downside though, is waking up early.  Thankfully a lot of Dim Sum restaurants keep serving until after 2pm, so that's a win for me!

This place is not the best Dim Sum restaurant I've been to, in fact it probably isn't even in the top 15 for me.  The place looks like your typical Chinese banquet hall for weddings, except the decor looks a bit dated and old school.  Imagine your grandmother had free rein to design a room, and booyah this is what you get!  The best part about the interior design is there are window curtains and window frames that are placed on top of a brick wall you can't see out of!  Also they have a trippy fake wedding cake with Christmas lights on it in the middle, very Sci-Fi!

The Dim Sum was decent, but not the greatest.  The food was a bit on the greasy side, and the options were rather limited (maybe because I woke up so damn late).  Prices were also almost twice as much as other places around the area, but may be expected since it's a new restaurant in the neighborhood.  Servers were pretty decent and they did get all of our food out relatively quick.  

This place certainly does not deserve a single star, but I will give it two.  The restaurant might be passable in other areas of the GTA, but in Markham there are tons of other options to get your Dim Sum on that taste better, and are on the cheap!"}
{"text":"This place is great bang for your buck.   The special menu is really good.  Had the double lobster, this was delicious, great flavour and crispy.   I also indulged in the fish (garopa I think).   It was done 2 ways.   The bonier dish had a really good flavour (to much bones for my liking) and the other one was boneless and refreshing with the vegetables.   

Portions are really good at this place .   Was not a big fan of the complimentary dessert.   The taro with sago was a bit bland and the almond cookies were chewy.

Overall great meal and very clean atmosphere.  Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum. Quality is poor compared to the many high end dim sum restaurants in the area. The only good thing is that as a result you can always get a table, even during early dim sum. 

Early dim sum? (before 11am) is $3.10 / dish.  Most items are of average quality. I'd be very disappointed if I had to pay full price. The restaurant is also understaffed so service is on the slow side. 

I can only recommend coming here if you have a large group with kids and don't want to sit through the hour wait required at the good neighboring dim sum restaurants (Dragon Boat, Shangri-La, Skyview, etc). 

There is plenty of parking as this is a shared lot with other businesses"}
{"text":"We went to Gold Mark Chinese Cuisine for dim sum around lunchtime, and it was quite packed. We were given a table that was too small - but the waitress objected that it would be too complicated to change table. There was a larger table ready 3 meters away and we offered to move all of our plates ourselves, but she kept shaking her head. She finally agreed after we flagged a manager that was passing by. I don't really mind this kind of hiccup. Dim sum parlors are notoriously busy during holidays, and I'm pretty sure she just didn't want other clients to wait extra time because we took their table. 

We ordered a large variety of dishes. Everything came fairly fast and nothing was forgotten. The food was well prepared and good, but nothing outstanding. The preserved egg and pork congee barely contained any meat or egg. On the other hand, the chesnut and pumpkin congee was very popular with my family. Portion sizes were quite good, and although we didn't order that much, everyone was satisfied and full (we were a group of seven). 

Overall good. Would go back, but wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Terrible service - Staffs are overwhelmed and they don't know how to service their customers.  Don't bother with this restaurant.  Family dinner on a Saturday night, waited over 3hrs for a 12 course dinner entree. 


Help your self to Tea refill / help your self to clean plates / ask a million times for rice /: ) 


Never will return!!"}
{"text":"Service so far is below sub par. Staff's service attitude is non existent. We called ahead to seek further information and made a reservation. When we arrived they said the set dinner we ordered doesn't bloody exist. However 1 service staff's attitude changed my view as she gave me some professional attitude that is much appreciated.

Onto the food. We ordered another set dinner plus other dishes. Some of the dishes are great. For example: the ribs, the duck and lobster were great. Chicken was alright. However, the shrimp came out bad, and it tasted a bit on the rotting side. They offered to remake it. However, remaking the dish won't make any difference when the main ingredient, the shrimp is bad. 

So overall experience was average. May not come back again."}
{"text":"Gold Mark doesnt hit gold unfortunately in terms of how I would rank my dim sum experiences within the GTA. Service was good the time I went. For the prices after early bird hours, they were a bit high when the quality wasnt on par with that of Crown Prince or Yangs. Some dishes were sloppily put together such as the egg tart, they slid way off the plate and their paper wrappers, I had to make them look better for a photo haha.

Still, the dim sum was decent, the tarts were tasty and the fried honey dough was an unique dish I havent seen at another dim sum restaurant. Would come back if nearby again."}
{"text":"First time here. I find that the service is lazy. No one take the empty plate. We need to ask for tea when it's empty even when they are at the table. The food is very average. Not a big fan of this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food poisoning! Came for dimsum..and all of us were sick after!!!!

Do not come here unless you want food poisoning. When the food was brought to out table, the bamboo steamers fell apart when she placed it on our table! 

They are stingy on the tea as well.. a
 few leaves so the tea was sooo weak!

Epic fail dim sum."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since we always go to the same restaurant for dim sum (we know they're consistent). The food here is pretty average in their choices. One thing that caught our eye (maybe our tastebuds) was the ????? ?\"runny yolk pineapple topping bun\"). So we got it. There was no runny yolk at all. It had all coagulated inside the bun. What a let down as that is the best part. The other items were ok but inconsistent. For example the sticky rice (????one had lots of yolk and another had none. The other place we go to (Golden Duke) has the same amount in each so you don't feel ripped off when you look at your friend's rice. The shuimai (??) was very firm and had no mushroom. Some had shrimp and others not. The flavor was so lacking even my 4-year old complained and didn't eat it.  The mushroom and veggie dumpling stuck so much to my bowl that I would have benefitted from using an ice scraper to get it out. It tasted ok though... 

I could go on but I'll describe the one good thing... Their red bean pudding (???) was very good. Not too sweet but with lots of coconut milk flavor and red beans.  Oh and their tea tasted good too. 

I guess you gotta try a place once to know. Would we come back?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Lunch and dinner is like night and day. Dim sum is busy with unique selection and upscale tea to match.  Dinner for the first time was a surprise as the meal was excellent with huge portions.

For dim sum, plan to get there early as they have their specials like others before 11 am. If you get the before 10, you should be seated with a short wait and as long as you submit your order before 11, dim sum will be at the special price. If not, dim sum will be pricier than you expected when you came in.

For dinner, my family ordered banquet style with 16 people including 6 kids. We were surprised as the meal fed all of us to our delight and we just added a dish or two to the set dinner. Total price was much less than what you would normally expect for the quality."}
{"text":"We came in during a Chinese New Year event. Decor was really nice and bathroom was nicely decorated as well. Everything else was not so great. The food was subpar and our server was rude. Our wine glasses were dirty (they had detergent scum on them) so I asked the server if she could change them. She rudely told me to wait since she was busy and then she came back half an hour later and proceeded to fill up my wine glass with water. I told her that this wasn't what I wanted but she ignored what I said and stormed off :/ Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Wasn't really happy with customer service; I have a peanut allergy that's pretty life-threatening and it says on the menu to ask the staff. Every time we asked, though, they didn't know whether that menu item had peanuts or not. At least they seemed a little apologetic."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Was told we'd have to wait if we placed an order at \"this time\" which was about 12:30pm. Food was quite disappointing, especially considering this place sells itself as some sort of premium restaurant. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Nice roomy area,high ceiling,easy to find parking. Food was good,but not \"Great\". Fancy dinner for two for about $50/per person,not bad actually for what they give you. Worth a try."}
{"text":"On getting there and going in, this place looks promising. A good amount of parking out front, overly decorated Victorian (which appears all the hype these days in Toronto Chinese cuisine) decor and a spacious room leaves much to expect.

We get there really early for dinner and the food come quick, too quick. There is no space on the table for more food and it hurriedly comes out. While I love having all the food and not having to wait, there is also a time when the food comes to quick that you can't enjoy it and you have to help them find room on the table.

The food itself, tastes decent. There is plenty of wraps for the peking duck. The wraps though are a bit thick for my liking. The food is presented nice enough but doesn't really have any wow factor. There is this fish filet dish which was delicious with mushrooms.

When the check comes, I give them a credit card and they tell me today they only accept cash. First, they could have said something. Second, normally they would give a modest discount to request cash. And third, they obviously accept credit card (thanks yelp for providing this information), but if I'm being charged tax and I get no discount I expect to be able to use my credit card.

Oh, the price includes a discount for cash they cry. That never happens at Chinese restaurant cause people want to know and see a discount and embedding it into the price is just not what any Chinese restaurant would do. They would quote a higher price and then show you on the bill they gave you a discount to make you feel all happy.

So get you story straight and accept my credit card."}
{"text":"Mom chose this cuisine for family dinner for CNY. At the end of the dinner, the consensus is that it's not too greasy, salty or sweet (complimentary dessert).

We ordered fish, chicken, mushroom, beef and oyster dishes. My family is very vocal and opinionated about what they put in their mouth and they have not much to criticize about. Clean simple and well made food!"}
{"text":"Honesty I had no expectation from Goldmark at the first place since it's opening, however I have to admit that it is getting better in terms of food and service.

I came here few times for both dimsum and dinner. Food and service is always on par.  This place deserves a 3 stars without a doubt.  Of course there are still some spaces for improvement to bring their service and food to a higher level.

I give this review a 4 stars because I and my company had a blast when we had our company's Christmas party at Goldmark.  We had the whole restaurant for 300 people.  The owner and the manager were very helpful and professional.  Everything I asked for was prepared and arranged properly.  Red carpet at the front entrance.  Dining tables were set neatly and beautifully.  One server serviced two tables but service was still attentive.  Food for big party like it was not amazing but totally acceptable.  Everything was served hot and fresh.  The manager, Sam, was particularly helpful to coordinate with our party programme.

We requested staying behind an hour at the last minute since people were still enjoying their dance.  The owner and staff was happy to accommodate our need.

Did I mention?  There are plenty of parking space.

I highly recommend this place for any banquet events and corporate dinner parties."}
{"text":"The food was ok, fried rice was way too salty. If I had an option to put no stars I would. Service was terrible, lady was rude slamming our plates on the table. Very impolite and seemed like she hated her job, when we asked to pack up the food she made a snide remark saying how people usually don't take home leftovers...is it any of your business what we do with the food we paid for? Would not return bad experience and not worth the price either."}
{"text":"Bait and Switch.  Super slow.

The menu specified one 10lb lobster.  We got 4 mini lobsters where the body of each lobster is as long as my index finger.  When we told the waitress this dish wasn't ours, she insisted it was and that if it was an error, they would replace it.  When we told the manager, he explained they were all out of the 10lb lobsters.  However, in the tank, you could see that they definitely had lobsters bigger than the ones we got, although maybe not 10lbs.  We felt ripped off bc there's much less meat in these little lobsters and they hadn't asked us first!  They ended up taking $20 off the bill but for a meal that cost $350, it's a lot of anguish.  

The veggies also didn't come as planned.  They came by and said they were all out of the veggie the set meal included.  Funny they put a huge plate of what we ordered on our table 5 minutes before and took it away bc they said it wasn't ours and served it to the table 2 tables away!  That table was lucky we hadn't started eating from it but it's not sanitary to do so.  The replacement veggies was half the size of the previous dish.

Our family had 2 tables.  We waited 20 minutes before the soup came.  Our other table waited 45 minutes before the first plate came.  Our table was already at the last 2 dishes!  

We won't be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here with 2 friends for early dim sum.  The dim sum is very reasonable priced if you order before 11am ($3.10 per dish).  We got a variety of dim sum as usual.  I enjoyed the egg tart and the rice noodle rolls the most.  Overall, all the food was fairly fresh, I'd say the quality of the food in general above average.  The service is average, you would probably have to wave at the waiters to get service, but they got our stuff right away when we asked for it (ie. hot sauce).  There is probably a line up to get a table if you are coming in before 11.  But if you come in after 11 it dies down by quite a bit as one would expect since the special is over.  I will definitely be coming back to Gold Mark Chinese Cuisine in the future."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 2/5

I came here for Saturday morning dim sum as you do, and the whole experience was all around average. The place looks like one of those fancy Chinese banquet halls and the price is on the more premium side for dim sum (ended up being around $50 for 4 people). The dim sum was on the better side of average, but nothing to write home about. Surprisingly, they actually have a couple outdoor tables with umbrellas in a patio-type dining area. Overall, don't be fooled by the cascading chandeliers- I wouldn't expect too much from this restaurant. There are much better dim sum restaurants in the Markham area. 

I can't comment about their dinners or special occasion dining."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service

Gold Mark Chinese Cuisine looks like one of those upscale dim sum restaurants, similar to the whole Casa brands. However, the outside looks somewhat unappealing as there isn't much decoration...not to mention the entrance to the restaurant faces away from Woodbine.

We arrived for dinner at around 8pm and found the place relatively full, but we did manage a table immediately. There were a lot of menu pages and options, so it took a while for us to digest...eventually we ordered half a roasted a starter soup, crispy chicken, fried crab claw, and mixed mushrooms.

Overall we found the dishes to be on the healthy side, which is good if you're one of those health conscious characters. It bears similarities to the Regal brand, which also specialized in healthy Chinese fine dining. However, we found the portions to be on the small side and the prices to be on the high end. Definitely expect to spend on the high end if you are to dine here, at least for dinner.

With so many choices for Chinese fine dining, I don't see myself returning in the short term. However I wouldn't give this place a direct red flag as the food isn't terrible."}
{"text":"This review is for dim sum only.

I've been here a couple of times for dim sum. The food is fresh and there are deals for when you arrive before 11am ($2.90 for S/M/L and $3.90 for XL). They also have a separate menu for noodle or rice dishes. I did notice that sometimes the dim sum dishes are not consistent. For example, the siu mai dumplings didn't have fish roe on top the second time I went, and the cuttlefish tentacles were a lot less than before. 

The ambiance is good. Very open and Chinese banquet style with a lot of bright chandeliers and gold colours. It's a very big restaurant and they have a whole section in the foyer with wedding banquet options available for those who are interested in hosting a wedding at a Chinese restaurant.

The service was mediocre. They weren't friendly, just nonchalant. I asked for a new bowl when we first arrived because mine had dried rice on it. I thought the waitress would bring it to the kitchen and bring another bowl, but she just switched it with another bowl from the next table. 
Also, we arrived at 11am and didn't realize that they had a special before 11am, so I assumed we were paying the full price. When the bill came, I put down my credit card, and the waitress said that it was \"on special\" so I had to pay \"cash only.\" I had to scramble looking for cash and thank goodness had enough.  They really should tell you these things before you order.

All in all, I'll probably try a different dim sum place next time just to compare as there are others in the area. It's hard to find a good and consistent restaurant these days though!"}
{"text":"Like the last review, another one of those fancy dim sum places with grand chandlers that looks like a huge banquet hall, wait wasn't too bad on a Sunday but the prices here are ridiculous....$5.90 for a XL and they have har gow and squid tentacles, they name the dishes so dam fancy on the menu when in fact it's just the same shit everywhere except for a few like we got the seafood and shrimp dumpling which looks nice and all but you can barely pick it up without it breaking into pieces....the shrimp crepe noodle rolls was good but other than that nothing special....service sucked too as it took forever to get our bill because all the waitress/managers were chatting it up with familiar patrons 
Four dishes 2 XL, 1 L and 1 M came up to $26.....if I pay for high price dim sum I rather goto the one at warden and hwy7

Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I normally like the food here, although the price is on the higher end.  The place is quiet,  clean,  and spacious.  We ordered dace balls in clay sauce ????? today.   The Chinese version of the menu read DACE while the English version read \"fish balls\".  The dim sum came out looking vastly different than the normal dace ball dish.  We questioned the staff and they claimed that there is no dace fish in Canada and showed us the box that read  \"basa\", saying that all restaurants use the same fish instead of dace.  So the writing on the menu is not what they produce in practice.  They claimed that they used basa because it was fresh, and did not want to use frozen fish.  But the  basa label was on a cardboard box,  which clearly indicated that it was from a box of frozen fish.  Integrity is the issue here.  Not happy that paid for abd orders dace balls but got basa paste balls."}
{"text":"This restaurant ruined a special occasion dinner and verbally abused us. I am not kidding.

Sunday night reservation for a party of 6 people- we originally had a 6pm reservation, however, we were told that it would have to be 5:30pm instead... fine, considering that it was lunar new year's eve.

We started arriving at 5:30pm and within 5 minutes of sitting down, a waitress tried to place a steamed fish dish down at our table (!?) We had not ordered, there were only 2 people at our table of 6 so far, and to top it all off we didn't even get our tea or beverages yet. 

5:45pm- our party of 6 were all seated. We ordered a seafood set dinner (lobster, abalone) well before 6pm. 
6:15pm to 6:20pm- several waitstaff come by to ask why we had not ordered yet (!?) we keep showing them the order receipt on our table and telling them we already ordered. The night gets so much worse....
6:35pm- we finally started getting our dishes rudely thrown on the table. When we commented that we were receiving dishes out of order, a waiter told us to \"eat what was there!\" 
6:45pm- The restaurant was only at 60% capacity and there were plenty of empty tables with excess waitstaff floating around.

Entrees came before appetizers, fried rice and noodles that come as the last entrees came in the middle and when we commented that other main dishes had not yet arrived our waitress took the dishes for a 5 minute walk and came back placing them on our table. Since it was lunar new year's eve, we did not want to spoil the mood and make a scene, however, this was actually impossible. When we asked them to serve the dishes in order, she argued, yelled at us and hurried away. The food itself was mediocre and the portions were inconsistent- tepid food temperatures and some dishes tasted as if they weren't seasoned at all.

This is the first time I've ever experience a high-end Chinese restaurant treat patrons so poorly. I've never had waitstaff yell at my table before and this dinner really soured our celebratory evening. We had elderly grandparents with us who had been sitting in this restaurant for almost 2 hours eating small portions of food, spaced out 20 minutes at a time. It was painful to watch.

7:20pm- the second sitting begins to arrive for their reservations and hoards of people (~30-40) are waiting near the entrance to be seated. Tables like us aren't ready to leave yet because we haven't received our food. Waitstaff are visibly distressed and there was just chaos.
7:40pm- two of us had to leave early due to prior commitments- we were still missing 2 entrees at this time, plus desserts. How embarrassing!

The waitstaff gave us terrible attitude and spoke to us so rudely, as if we were there asking for handouts of food scraps. Thinking about it makes me cringe that our grandparents had to be subjected to that kind of treatment when we wanted to have a lovely family meal. I'm so disappointed with this restaurant. There is something VERY wrong with their kitchen- as if a handful of their line cooks just suddenly walked out.

There is nothing that would make me come back here."}
{"text":"As a Dim Sum connoisseur, and growing up in Vancouver, I've ate lots of Dim Sum. This place is worth the visit as this place is that it is one of the many few restaurants that offer discounted Dim Sum $2.99 each on S/M/L dishes, 7-days a week!

Also, what made this place stood one was the unique dishes that I didn't even see in Vancouver Dim Shop places. They had Ox Tail, Pig Intestine, and fried Sweet Chinese Pancake that hit the spot for dessert. They also have very good Congee and Zongzi (Wrapped Sticky Rice). Go and pick up your chopsticks and start enjoying some unique and well-crafted Dim Sum.

I will definitely revisit. A solid 4 stars!"}
{"text":"We tried a Black Cod feast with lobsters for 10 people, it is only $388, wow, Vancouver would be at lease $700+ for the same meal. Superb quality lobster."}
{"text":"Came here for the Lion's Club CNY dinner, what I can say, I found Toronto's worst restaurant, service is beyond poor, the staff didn't know how to divide our food, did not change dishes when it was clearly needed.There were no ice for our soft drinks, for a table of 10, we had 4 cans of pop, the food quality is so bad, we literally did not eat half of our food, I don't know who is the chef in that place, he should be fired. The noodle dish was so salty it was inedible, when the dessert came, they didn't even give you a plate, just 10 plastic forks.I had been to this place for dim sum before, my friends ban this place for poor service, wonder how long this place can stay in business, what a shame."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous and very clean.  Handsome Manager Daniel recommended that we order from the cash only pre-set menu for 4.  We did  and was treated to large dishes of high quality ingredients and seafood.  Fresh sea bass cooked two ways, giant prawns, and half of what must of been a  large chicken fried to perfection. But the star of the night was the fish broth that opened up the feast.  The portions were generous; we had enough left over for another dinner the next night.  Oh, it was all for CA$98 cash.  Remember to ask for the Chinese menu.  Manager Daniel accurately translated the menu for us."}
{"text":"dim sum was ok. nothing amazing. service wasn't too good."}
{"text":"Average, but I wouldn't suggest this place. Is that would probably make it less than average. The food and tea is fine, but for the non-wow factor, the prices don't match up. For this kind of pricing, go down the street to Spring Villa! 

The inside, on a quick glance, looks like those fancified Chinese banquets but this is an illusion. Tinsel to everyone's gold leaf. Plastic to everyone's crystal. If wanted fancified dimsum with average food, just go Premiere ballroom or Casa Victoria! 

If I'm back again, it'll be at the request of the family, not my own recommendation!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre, service is absolutely terrible and slow, and always forgets things. Waited for the bill for 20 minutes!!"}
{"text":"From all the Dim Sum places in the GTA, this is the only place that doesn't use excessive MSG (I am very sensitive to it)

The food quality is pretty good and consistent in quality from the multiple visits to this location. Price is on the higher side but I'd rather pay a slightly higher price for better service, quieter environment (still noisy, but better than most Dim-sum places), and nearly-zero MSG."}
{"text":"We had my son's 100 day celebration here and had 2 tables for dim sum. Food was average and service wasn't good since we ordered a bunch of items and asked them to split it between the two tables evenly but they just dumped everything on one table and we had to distrthe dishes ourselves. 

When we ordered additional items, it also took a very long time for them to arrive. This shouldn't be the case since it was peak hours and any decent restaurant should know to have things going at this time especially when you have at least 1 large group. 

Had to ask for more tea and extra napkins, no booster seats there when we had requested it in advance. Nothing was ready when we needed it to be. Perhaps it's better when it's just a small outing? 

One stand out part is that they have a family washroom with a change table which was nice even though it was kinda dirty."}

Gold Mark Chinese Cuisine is the newest \"high\" end Cantonese Restaurant that opened in Markham.

Nicely decorated space well suit for functions and banquets. This place seems to have a lot of potential. 

Dim Sum Special on Weekday before 11 am  S/M/L order $2.90 XL order $3.90 seems to be a good deal as the portion here is definitely generous. Sadly most of the dim sum we ordered were a miss or a meh as most of them were so salty that I cannot even enjoy them.

Service is a little bit rough compare to other same price point level restaurants I have been too.

I doubt I would be back as there are so many other dim sum restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for dim sum. Overall, the meal wasn't great. Although the bbq pork buns were fresh and tasty, the majority of the dishes were bland and flavourless. I ordered two noodle specialty dishes which were fairly expensive (about $15 each) and neither one had much flavour to it. The shrimp cheung fun was also pretty bland. I definitely won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?

Their banquet dinner fixed menus. Their dim sum before 10 am because it costs the same for dim sum small, medium or large. 

Their banquet dinners are usually priced very reasonably. We came here last time to try the 5 person banquet dinner and we still had enough leftovers to bring home. And guess what? It costs only $200 for the banquet dinner. Just look at my pictures to see! 

Their dim sum is for a fixed price if you order before 10 am which makes it more affordable for someone who enjoys dim sum but don't want to pay for the price of a large. 

LAST TIP?

don't just order a la carte. See if the banquet dinners make sense for your party size or ask what specials they have for banquet style dinners for parties five and bigger. Or ask about dishes that are on special."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday morning with two families. There wasn't too long of a wait time to get a table. The service was not good though. 

When we asked for another tea pot, the waitress said we couldn't get one because they didn't have any left for us to use. We were pretty surprised at that response. We asked again but this time it was a a manager and he gave it to us no problem. 

Unfortunately, we waited over 40 minutes to get our first dish. People that had arrived after us were getting food before our table. Eventually, we had to ask a manager why our food was taking so long and ten minutes after we asked, we finally started getting our dishes. 

The food itself was decent. I liked their noodle rice rolls. Their congee wasn't that great. They do have many varieties of shrimp dumplings. 

It's pretty spacious so you don't feel super crammed like some other dim sum restaurants. It sucks that the service was so bad."}
{"text":"We had a chinese event here with the preset 10 course dinner and show. 
This is the same location where Fish House used to be. They did a good job renovating it; it's spacious and washrooms were a lot cleaner than other chinese restaurants.
We didn't get to order from their regular menu as it was a set 10 course dinner. The lobster dish, vegetables & mushroom dish, and deep fried chicken were quite delicious. Lobster was flavourful; vegetables were crisp; and chicken was quite moist. 
The other dishes were just ok, nothing special. 

Overall, we had a decent experience. We'll return to give their regular menu or dim sum a try."}
