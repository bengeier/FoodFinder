{"text":"This place is better than the one in Rostraver.  Cleaner and the gas is almost always cheaper.  Stopped in and we decided to try the General Tso sub.  Crispy General Tso's chicken (may the founder RIP), topped with egg rolls (yes,...egg rolls) and Siracha sauce, on sesame bread.  We didn't eat them until the next day but man they were still good!  We tried the Thanksgiving sub with the cranberry sauce,...not big fans.. We'll stick with the Tso's.  And we'll be back for them."}
{"text":"Buyer Beware.  Don't stop at this location for coffee in the morning.  Three times I have tried in the past month and three times I have been disappointed.  Twice all the carafes had \"expired\" so you either had to wait for a fresh brew or drink burnt coffee.  And the third time, all carafes were out ... entirely out.  The rest of the store is good.  Employees are nice.  Food tastes great.  Donuts are always fresh.  And during the lunch rush, you can usually get in and out pretty fast.  Despite all those positives, there's better options until they sort out their coffee."}
{"text":"If you are not familiar with this place it sits where Giant Eagle use to have a store straight out of the late 70s.  Now, let me tell you a story of why this place is setup the way it is.  Before Pennsylvania decided to get with the times with their liquor laws Giant Eagle as well as several other companies and corporations tried their hardest to find loopholes on selling alcohol to their customers.  This is the case with this place.  It is a GetGo, but it is set up so differently than other locations.  Prior the changes in alcohol sales you were not allowed to sale alcohol in gas stations/convenience stores, so for them to bypass this they decided to build a GetGo gas station and a GetGo café separately on one piece of land.  The gas station part is setup like what you would find near a Giant Eagle.  Really can't buy much at the gas island portion, but as soon as you go to the other side of the lot you have the store part.  In order to sale alcohol you needed to prove that you had a café on premise or had the ability for patrons to eat at your property.  That is what they did here.  Allowing for beer to be sold without having to go to a distributor.  The café part is close to immaculate.  Everything is clean and organized.  Late at night it is mostly quiet.    I am always appreciative of the free air for tires which I partook in while I was here."}
{"text":"Good location. Clean store and friendly staff he few times I've been in. Offers everything you could except from a convenience store. MTO food. I'm a fan of the breakfast sandwiches and coffee! No complaints about this location so far."}
