{"text":"Someone told me about this place. I tried it once--I had the chicken and chipotle mayo--and in matter of days I was there three to four times. I have tried the Club House which is great and the vegetarian as well as salad and the breakfast sandwich. A great shop, with quality food in a super clean environment. Give it a try once, and you be hooked without a doubt."}
{"text":"After a long wait and passing by a \"coming soon\" sign for months, this place finally opened. I had a good first sandwich and the selection was great. Quality ingredients, great bread, and a clean, modern space. It's small, but it's all the space you need. I got a huge sandwich stuffed with an awesome chicken salad, pancetta, arugula and sun dried tomatoes. A delicious play on a chicken BLT and it was huge! I was stuffed!  This is another great addition to Mount Dennis. It starts with an Indie Coffee Shop with cute tattooed baristas with purple hair and nerd glasses, then you get a vegan restaurant, then a cool sandwich shop.... Boom... There goes the neighborhood!  Thanks for moving in, Neighbour!"}
{"text":"Exceptionally friendly service. I was provided a sampler plate of both pulled pork and chicken, with four different sauces from which I chose a pulled pork sandwich, with barbecue sauce, pickled onions and jalapeno peppers in cider vinegar. Absolutely delicious and for just $8 for a sandwich big enough for two meals. No seating. Take-out only. Next time, I likely won't wait to eat until I get home."}
