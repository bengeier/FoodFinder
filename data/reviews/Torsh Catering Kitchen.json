{"text":"I ordered food including chicken kabab through ubereats and ended up with food poisoning from the chicken.   Veal kabab tasted very irony. Gheymeh stew tasted very blah. Very small portions for the price you pay. Not worth $70.   Never again!"}
{"text":"I found Torsh online when looking for middle eastern food that is top quality and delivers in the downtown area. Reza the owner was very passionate in his explanation about his food, the ingredients are locally sourced and the flavour is amazing. The eggplant appetizer Kashke bademjan is really amazing, and the presentation of all of the food even in delivery was beautiful. We also loved the olive appetizer and pomegranate walnut marinade veal was really great. Highly recommend if you have an appreciation for good Persian food and like the convenience of take out/delivery."}
{"text":"I wasn't into Persian Food until I tried Torsh at an event earlier this year. Their eggplant dip is so addictive!!! I had them cater an event in May '14. Service and food were excellent. Their presentation is excellent. I will use them for future events!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! I love that it is a family-owned business, they take such good care of you and their customer service is one of the best I've ever had.  They take a lot of care into picking their ingredients and the food is very very fresh.  I am a persian food newbie and I'm hooked!  Must try their kabobs!!  Fast delivery service as well!  Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing compared to other Persian food I have had. Couldn't believe how the zeytoon was."}
{"text":"We normally have to venture to Richmond Hill to get a decent Persian meal and I'm so glad to report that we won't be doing that anymore! Finally a place downtown that has high quality authentic Persian food!  The owner Reza is quite friendly and takes pride in sourcing individual ingredients. You can tell he's got the right palate for fine tuning of flavours!   If you live in the West End, they deliver ... or better yet, go pick up ... he's so friendly he might give you a sample or two, like he did with us!"}
{"text":"Simply put: the BEST Persian Kitchen in Toronto! Don't miss this! The food is amazing, a culinary winner, with flavour explosions to delight your palate and tastebuds! First encountered this place during Taste of Italy on College Street. Now, I would drive any distance to pickup takeout from this hidden gem! And what's better? They deliver too!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food! We got their 5-course Valentine's Day combo delivered through Foodora (I had a $50 promo code from a contest). It came with their Chef's Specialty Beef Short Rib, Joojeh Kebab (Chicken), Two Rices (Dill & Saffron, Persian Jasmine w/ Barberries), Eggplant Dip and a small box of Persian sweets as dessert.   The short rib was extremely tender, fall off the bone and still amazingly hot after being delivered. The rices were exceptional as well, my favourite being the dill. All the food was excellent, but pricey. I'm not sure I'd pay the same if I didn't have the promo code discount. If it was at a restaurant, I think it would make a difference, too bad they only cater or deliver. I wish they'd open up a place for sit down meals!"}
{"text":"Just had takeout and it was great.  The beef short ribs in particular were absolutely delicious. Also had koobideh and gormeh sabzi,  which the kids loved (the grown ups too)."}
