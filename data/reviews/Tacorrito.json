{"text":"Update - I went to this place on Halloween night with friends. I was amazed to see the staff managing the crowd so well. I had never been to Tacorrito in the evening. Loved the fish quesedilla and Mexican Poutine. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Places like these should be encouraged in the neighbourhood !"}
{"text":"Ive given this place 3 tries before putting a review on. I was really hoping to get better. In two times beans were undercooked, one of the times was unedible. I am not a big fan of beans so in both times I just scrape it out my burrito or Bowl and let it go... But last time the manager (or owner I don't know) sold me an almost brown guacamole. I was taking out and order guacamole on the side and when I got home I noticed it was a side of gross almost brown gracamole. Hope they close Soon so places with quality food can come along."}
{"text":"Great freshly made burrito with all the toppings. Friendly staff and delicious food makes this place perfect for lunch with co workers. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This was honestly one of the best burrito bowls I've ever had! Have tried many Mexican restaurants throughout the GTA and can say hands down that Tacorrito is better than quite a few \"authentic\" restaurants. Seriously, try the Spicy Fish tacos or Tacorrito bowl, thank me later."}
{"text":"About a year ago, when they started, I would have given them a 5-star. Not any more.  For example, today, I bought the spicy fish and chips, which was a box full of fries and two really small pieces of fish that doesn't qualify as part of such a meal.  In the past they've served me decently sized pieces of fish with the fries. Today, I ordered imagining I'll get the same quality and quantity. But alas! I don't go back as frequently as I used to and it'll be my last resort for food in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would.  This is the worst Mexican and burrito place in all of Toronto.  Especially given that there are so many options in this city, never, ever settle on this craphole when you are craving a burrito.  If you do, you will likely spend the following day chained to the toilet as their festering meats and rancid guacamole will make you wish you ate dog food instead.    DINE SAFE - I would advise checking this place out.  I look forward to whatever type of restaurant takes its place when Tacorrito goes out of business"}
{"text":"I have never written a review before. I felt compelled to this evening after having my 21st Barrito since they opened. I really enjoyed Taccarito when it opened but it has fallen very fast. Over the last month The size of the Barrito shrunk by a third and the quality has slipped. Back to Barrito Boys for me."}
{"text":"Tacorrito just opened near my condo and we were excited to check it out. Maybe there are some things that will be ironed out over time, but this is definitely not a place worth checking out right now.  I ordered a chicken & steak mix burrito, my friend ordered two soft tacos, and we split an order of chips and guac.    Service: It took nearly ten minutes for them to serve the couple of people in front of us. Service was really disorganized and customers were getting annoyed.    Food quality: Awful. The quality of the meat was atrocious and there was no real flavour, other than from the two full scoops of hot sauce that was put on my burrito. As a bachelor I am familiar the concept of covering up bland, crappy food with a lot of spice, but I don't expect that from a restaurant.  The chips weren't even tostitos quality and the guacamole was runny.  Definite pass."}
{"text":"The food tasted ok. It's equally priced with other local places but the burrito I had was a lot smaller and I ordered a large. I will not be going back here again. Why would I when just around the corner on yonge street there's bar burrito and fat bastard burrito that offered better tasting burritos that are larger and for the same price. This was my first and last visit.  It's too bad because I live in the neighbourhood and was excited to see to a new business but I am not going to get attached because I know it's not gonna last long."}
{"text":"The fish taco was terrible. The server crumbled and overcooked piece of fish over each taco shell and there was hardly any fish on each taco . . . with a modest amount of toppings I couldn't even tell it was a fish taco. No taste other than jalapenos. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Unfriendly staff. Do not honour their own coupons. Burritos are all filler beans/rice. Fish Tacos have a miniscule amount of a tilapia fish stick. Be careful if you ask for any dressing they will go wild and douse it on. Tons of better alternatives in the city."}
{"text":"The food was good, warm and the quesadilla was generous in size.  Not loving paying $1 for the tiny cup of guacamole but it's on par with most other places so that's not a big point for me.  Would surely  visit again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here a couple of months ago. We both had food poisoning within 10 minutes of walking out the door. Never again."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at queen st. I order a veggie burrito and it was a huge burrito. All the ingredients was fresh and tasty.I definitely recommend this place if you love Mexican flavours. I will be back."}
{"text":"Crazy overpriced,  $26.75 for only two burritos to take out. Taste is very average at best,  nothing special.  Not worth the money. Not recommend it."}
{"text":"\"For an extra dollar would you like to add guacamole?\"   This is the saddest statement you can hear at a burrito place and usually indicates that the burrito itself will not be great (more on that). What makes your guac so great that you can charge a dollar extra? Burrito Boyz makes their guac fresh and they don't charge an extra dollar.    What do you know, the burrito wasn't great! Actually, it was miles from great, what a disappointing burrito, especially when I walked in the place, it looked really cool and interesting. Too bad the food doesn't match the d√©cor.    Had the chicken burrito, it was barely filled, barely toasted and most importantly it didn't taste great.   Damn! Was excited to have a new burrito place in the neighbourhood. Hey Burrito Boyz, open a location in the area and show these hacks how it's done!"}
{"text":"Their tacos and bowls are kinda 'mehh', but i would recommend their mexican poutine. However if you order it with meat, DO NOT get their pork. worst 'pulled pork' ever. Just so dry and flavourless. Would be better if they didn't copy Chipotle and charged for guac."}
{"text":"Came here with a Mexican co-worker after work...  It was a HUGE disappointment!!  First, there were no Dos Equis (I had it before during Halloween night on church street)!  The lady employee didn't even know what was it!!!  Then, the guy employee or I don't know if it is the owner told me that Dos Equis lager especial don't come in bottles anymore but only in cans.... Bullshit!!!  I just brought myself 2 packs of 6 in bottles from Beer store just the Thursday!    Then... my co-worker asked the guy if he speaks Spanish and he said well you can teach me...  So we ended up ordering Cheese nacho with sour cream/salsa/corn....  OMFG.... the sour cream taste like egg mayo!!!  WTF~!!!  it is running, yucky and taste like egg :S  Worse part has yet to come... NO LIME or LEMON for our Corona Extra.... SERIOUSLY??? no lime or lemon at a  \"Taco restaurant\"???  FML~!    I just embarrassed myself totally by bring my Mexican co-worker to this restaurant...   Half star for the price and half star for cleanliness of the restaurant.   I think the employee or the owner is Indian/Middle Eastern... I think they should better serve butter chicken and naan there, why not?"}
{"text":"It's not Chipotle. It's not fair to compare every Burrito place to Chipotle; I get it. The main complaints I have is that everything was overcooked (chicken, rice and beans primarily), the guacamole had turned brown and was unappealing (lack of lemon juice I suspect) and overall there just wasn't a lot of flavor.   I don't think Chipotle is by any means the best Burrito you can get...but right now it is the gold standard in popular consciousness and because of its prime location in the village people like me expect similar quality and taste but this place unfortunately just doesn't have it yet.   If you're starving and just want anything this place is decent, if you want anything more you should go somewhere else :-("}
{"text":"Horrible, my friend ordered a burrito and I ordered a burrito bowl. We were told that they were out of the veggies. A bit disappointing, but we wanted to try anyways. The person at the counter was extremely cheap and light with toppings. Considering they were out of veggies, I wanted more lettuce in my bowl. (You choose between rice or lettuce for the bowl, and I didn't want any rice.) So after she put a handful of lettuce, I asked for more. She then selected two leaves of lettuce to put on my bowl and quickly moved on. How can one be cheap with lettuce? IT'S LETTUCE! Considering I am not getting the tortilla, or any veggies you think one would want to make me happy and give me more lettuce. I WOULD HAVE EVEN PAYED FOR DOUBLE LETTUCE IF THIS OPTION WAS AVAILABLE TO ME. Instead, I am left feeling like I am begging for more toppings... when really... I want a real salad and prefer lots of lettuce. Also, my friend's burrito was cold. The chicken is really dry. I was not happy with my salad either, and overall this was a horrible experience for a new addition to my neighborhood. Companies need to realize that the majority of fast-casual restaurants are giving customers choice to customize with tons of value. Has Taccorito seen the HUMONGOUS salads Burrito Boyz is giving? And if you want more lettuce, they give you freaking lettuce!   My point is, IT'S LETTUCE.  Never again, BYE."}
{"text":"Tried them today for first time. Staff was attentive and location clean and well lit.  Ordered the medium steak burrito plus the nacho chips and a pop. Total just under $14 after tax.  The burrito was tasty. Ingredients tasted fresh and were ample.   My only issue concerned nacho chips. They treated way too salty. I won't be ordering these again.   Overall worth a visit."}
{"text":"Not bad place, but I was hungry, so I ate. They always advertised curry burrito, so I wanted to try it. However, I asked if they have curry burrito a couple of different times, but they always said they did not. If they did not have it, why did they have such a big poster? I tried a regular burrito. It was not bad, but not the best. The place was nice and clean, but there were usually not so many customers, so I felt uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Finally open!  If nothing else, what this place has going for them is joining a food-court that desperately needed some new options. This theory was clear on their grand opening as a line-up of more the 50 people extended from this small eatery trying to gain access to their opening day $1 taco special.  I had the chance to chat with some who indulged and the reviews were generally all positive. Which was good to hear, as this addition has been talked about since the signs first went up.  Today I had a chance to try my first option to which i selected a chicken Burrito. As far as expectations went it hit the right spot. Was by no means the best burrito i have ever eaten, that's asking a lot, however it was very much on par with something I could enjoy on a recurring basis.  Was nice to see an excited staff interested in finding their place in the Bloor Islington Place food court.   If they play their cards right, they will certainly be able to acquire a following, as I know the consumers of this facility well, and a good reputation can make or break you."}
{"text":"Up until today, for the last few years, this used to be my go to burrito spot in Corktown.  My last 3 orders in the past 3 weeks have been consecutively disappointing.  It seems there are new people working there aside from the girl at the cash register, perhaps new management and new chefs.  The quality of the food has dropped significantly.  The chicken is now overcooked, and the fish batter is overly spiced compared to the way it used to be.  The oils that they use need to be changed, it's evident in the batter on the fish and their fries.    The one major difference that has prompted this bad review is the quality control that they used to have is now gone at this location. My last 3 burritos have all been covered in black burnt carcinogenic soot that is left over in the hot presses that they use.  I mentioned this to them that they ought to clean those, that people should not be eating burnt food.  The guy preparing my burrito assured me it was clean.  The burrito shell is first warmed up on one press, that was clean this time (not the other two times), but when they put it back into the last hot press (after filling it with ingredients, folding it etc) my burrito was covered in the black stuff.  The girl at the cash apologized and said they would make me another one, for which I didn't care, I ended up just eating the contents inside without the shell.  I told them that they ought to be cleaning that thing, repeating myself here, that they ought to prevent their patrons from eating burnt food.  She mentioned that they put oil on the hot press to prevent it from sticking... so basically you're getting fried, burnt bits of dough on your burrito.  This is unacceptable.  I'm not going back unless I personally hear from someone from Tacorrito, giving me the assurance that they have their quality control back up again at this location."}
{"text":"It ain't no Chipotle.. That's for sure...   Their ingredients seem fresh enough, but the flavour just isn't there for me.. Also, the temperature of the food seemed a little cold to me. Maybe it just cooled down really quickly due to the cold weather, but it made it a lot less enjoyable..  I'll give them points on the style and decor of the place, though. Very cute and modern with lots of colour and personality. Now if they could just add some of that to their food..."}
{"text":"Living in The Village I saw the opening of Tacorrito. I haven't eaten here nor at their other location on Richmond St. Walking in just before a dinner rush on Saturday the line was already present. I waited less than 4 minutes to order and had even let a couple move ahead of me as I waited for response for a possible addon order for takeout. The place was clean, lit well and comfortable.  The menu is like other BIY (build-it-yourself) places where your order is taken and prepared behind a glass partition so you may inspect everything going into your meal. Each ingredient clearly laid out and NOT messy from spillovers or hurried employees. I ordered a large tilapia burrito with pinto beans, salsa and veggies and a large chicken burrito with black beans, veggies, salsa, sour cream and cheese. Both burritos were sized well to fill a hungry adult for dinner. Combos are available which add restaurant style chips and a coke for $3 more or a jarritos for $4 more.  The food was flavored and blended well. For $20 two burritos with a side of chips and a coke, I felt my meal was ok. 4 stars for price and quality I recommend this new spot in The Village."}
{"text":"This is exactly what that corner needed. This spot finally has something healthful and worthwhile. Like a Subway but with Mexican ingredients, Tacorrito can whip up a taco or two in record time. No waiting around for some fancy-pants little excuse for a taco with a few shrimps or a bit of greasy chorizo, instead you get a whack of some seasoned ground beef topped with some fresh veg and you're ready to hit Queen St. with a vengeance. They have some vegetarian options that sounded good and as well check out the spicy coated Mexican fries. The plate we ordered was absolutely gigantic! It took longer than the tacos, so we ate a few and I ended up taking the rest to work the next day where it was my lunch! Crazy-good!"}
{"text":"I have definitely had better! they don't serve steak only ground beef and it is burnt and dry! not the greatest! you are better off going to other places for burrito"}
{"text":"Super disappointing. I ordered from them off of Foodora, a Quesdilla Combo. Firstly, the quesadilla was terrible. I paid an extra 1.50 for guacamole and there was zero guacamole in the quesadilla or with the order. I also asked for sour cream, salsa and other add ons which they include on their menu, got absolutely none. The quesadilla was soggy and essentially just filled with beans and cheese, cut into 4 pieces that were stuck together in a box. I had to pry these soggy pieces apart. As a side they offer nachos or cookies. I got stale nacho chips but there's nothing else with it, just plain chips. Also, there were no napkins or utensils provided.   So the main part of the order was terrible i.e. I don't recommend ordering from them. Like, at all. There are much better places to spend your money. Especially when you're paying for things and are clearly mentioned in the order and not getting them (guac).   Also, when I called to comment on the order no one picked up. Went straight to voice mail.   This part isn't on them, but there's no way to comment or review on Foodora. So unfortunately if you're using the site, you won't know the quality of the food or service. So you're better off using uber eats or skip the dishes or any other app that can give you more info before placing your order (this part was my mistake).  Edit: my bad it wasn't this location, it was the tacorrito on 106 mutual street"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because of its attempt at trying to make something good. Not like the other burrito places this place is a touch more authentic. They need to heat things up a bit, food should be served warmer. They do have a few wrinkles to work out for sure with service and flow, hopefully that will come in time. Give this place a chance. I've had the nachos and the taco's, the price and portion was reasonable. We have grown so accustomed to our processed franchise style places I don't think \"good\" works anymore. We expect everything to taste the same and when something unique opens, we resist. We are the processed society."}
{"text":"Burrito is not that bad, same ideal as Chiptole in USA. Service friendly!!! Nice to sit by the window to look out the hot guys. Hahaha"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before a show. The service was friendly and efficient, however, the veggie burrito my partner and I shared was bland, and the brown rice inside was HARD. If that wasn't bad enough, I stopped by the washroom before leaving and it was disgusting - a bad sign. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food quality and quantity leaves much to desire. Nachos were cold, uncooked and service was poor. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"There is absolutely no need to visit this place. Dry, from the box-like taco shells housed tasteless meat, uninspired toppings and ended up being probably the worst taco I've had in my life.  The nachos were thoroughly bad. Gross cheese, and the chips were round! What self respecting Mexican serves round tortilla chips?  The ordering process was painfully inefficient and the staff were not the friendliest.  Why this place thought they could compete with all the solid places on Queen St. to get a taco is beyond me. I give them 6 months and they'll be gone."}
{"text":"I liked the toasted tortilla. Tasting the burrito didn't remind me of Mexican flavor. Perhaps because there were no tomatoes in the burrito. I ordered the bean burrito. I saw spoonfuls of guacamole being smeared in the burrito but i didn't taste it."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but the service is awful. The first time I visited with my girlfriend, the girl behind the counter stared at us looking bored and annoyed while we tried to decipher the menu board without any offer to help. After I told her my order, she rushed me through the topping selection while remaining stony-faced. The music was bad (and too loud), but the food was decent, so we decided to give them another chance.  On our second visit, there were two guys behind the counter. The guy who took my order seemed like he had no idea what he was doing. I ordered the bean tacos, which come with guacamole, which he didn't add until I asked for it. Then when I went to pay, he tried to charge me extra for it. I told him the menu says that guacamole is included and he went and peered at it for a good 30 seconds, then called me over and acted really confused. I had to explain to him several times that the menu said it was included. He was apologetic once he figured it out, but it was way more difficult than necessary.  The guy who served my girlfriend snatched the POS terminal out from under her hand, and then after she'd paid and taken her copy of the receipt, he demanded that she return it, told her she'd taken the wrong one, and gave her the merchant copy instead. Also, they somehow had the music tuned to two competing stations at once and apparently none of the staff noticed. Also, the food wasn't that good. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a local and I love me some Tacorrito luncheon.  When I'm working from home I like to hit Tacorrito for the 3 tacos - two soft, one hard. Two chicken, one pork. All the fixins. Mine for a very reasonable $7.90.  I welcome our new neighbour. And chuckle at those holding up Chipotle and f*king Z Teca - Z Teca! - as the gold standard for fast casual Mexican food."}
{"text":"Went there during pride week. Maybe it was cuz their line was really long but their bowl wasn't very good. Although the bowl is the same size as chipotle, the portion they put inside was half!! Additionally, the staff just seemed really pissed off in general. Wouldn't go back - I'd rather walk 10 min more to get chipotle!"}
{"text":"Located on Church Street (close to Wellesley Street East intersection), Tacorrito offers some of the best Tex-Mex fare in Toronto's downtown core area. Their menu offers a selection of burritos, tacos, and other staples of Tex-Mex cuisine in two sizes (small & large) and made to order with your preferred ingredients. Working with Foodora, Door Dash and other popular food ordering/delivery apps, I was able to place my order for pick-up for the specific time I stopped by the restaurant. With excellent, natural ingredients and great friendly service, Tacorrito has become my new fave spot for quality Tex-Mex cuisine."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I'm not sure if it was the fact I was craving a burrito or the fact it's the one thing nearby me at the time that didn't look sketch.   I went on during the lunch hour and ordered a chicken burrito. It was hard to hear what the guy was saying due to the music just blasting away. With the way everything was set up it reminded me of a chipotle influenced burrito place.   I found the burrito to be very bland and lack any sort of juiciness. The chicken was tough and under seasoned and the sauces were very minimal in flavour. The only thing I tasted was dry chicken, lime (where did that even come from? Lol) and air..   In the end 2 stars. As a Mexican place there has to be some flavour in the food. There was little to none. They get 2 stars for the decor inside and having Mandarin Jarritos."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I found the male staff friendly, food was great and it was quick. What more do you need?  Their pico de gallo is amazing. I tried charming the guy for the recipe. Kidding. Well half kidding.  Tonight we got the chicken quesadillas. They were great! They came with salsa, sour cream & guacamole. All delicious.  I did overhear a customer ask about the wraps; are they made with dairy or eggs. The female employee didn't know. Seems like an easy solution for management. Educate employees on the ingredients in the wraps.  I'm debating taking my boyfriend here after a wedding next month for a late night snack. Depends how tired we are! Anyways, I would return."}
{"text":"When you wish you had gone to Chipotle instead of this place, then you know the food is bad.  I had a pulled pork burrito.  The pork was dry, the wrap tasted stale and the toppings were boring and bland.  The place seemed a bit dirty.  I was already not going to go back because of the food alone, but then I read the review of the woman who was denied service because of her service animal.  Ugh, just don't go."}
{"text":"A friend and I got burritos the other day - she got the steak and I got pulled pork.  The pulled pork was white, which was disconcerting as I'm used to seeing it sauced.  It wasn't particularly tasty and both of us felt ill for days afterward.   So, not recommended.  Yeah."}
{"text":"At 7:50 pm on May 6, 2017. I came to purchase a burrito to go.  The second I came in I was told I could not have my dog.  She has always worn her vest and was when we came in that shows she is a service dog. Tan Jay -- would not tell me how to write his name, even told me that while my dog is a service dog neither of us are welcome. When I told him it is a 5000 dollar fine he said that is ok because he is just following orders.  I asked him to look up the laws about service dogs on line and he said he did not need to because he is following orders. When I said it is the law in Toronto and against the law to not permit service dogs he said that is ok we are not welcome. Please if you have a disability do not attend this restaurant.  And yes I will be contacting the city about this matter."}
{"text":"We actually tried this for the first time and ordered 4 burritos and a quesadilla.  We ordered on Foodora.ca.  The delivery was on time.  The food arrive as ordered.  Warm and savoury.  The support team was also very good with online help.  The partnership worked well.  Recommend people give it a go."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Came here on an evening and there were no other customers. Had their spicy fish taco and was not impressed. Food was a little stale and rather tasteless. Not cheap for what it is either."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing!  Very stingy with the toppings, of which there were few to choose from.   Our server was selectively spreading the beans on my quesadilla to make it look fuller than it really was.   While the end product looked healthy, it was extremely greasy and a huge let down   Definitely walk to Burrito Boys if you can!"}
{"text":"I had a burrito here, wasn't good.  There was no flavour, the veggies weren't that fresh, the spices weren't strong.. just didn't taste like a Spanish burrito.. more tasted like something someone TRIED to whip up in the kitchen at home with no experience...   If you want true burritos, better off going to the burrito place more south on sherbourne behind the Rabba at Front & Sherbourne.. now they have an AWESOME burrito!   Fyi, interior only looks cool but the food sucks."}
{"text":"Tried the fish tacos and they were pretty good.  Loaded with toppings and tasty.   Worth a try if in the area.  Will try the Mexican poutine next."}
{"text":"After months of waiting, this addition to the Bloor Islington Place food court is now open and operational. Unfortunately, in a small sea of other mediocre food court restaurants, this one doesn't stand out either.  The general process is pick between a taco ($2.99 for 1, $5.49 for 2, $7.99 for 3), burrito ($6.99 for small, $7.99 for medium, and $8.99 for large), or a quesadilla or burrito bowl for around the same price as a burrito.  After you pick your item of choice, you pick your filling (including steak, grilled chicken, ground beef, spicy fish, a bunch of vegetarian options), and your toppings (rice, black beans, pinto beans, assorted grilled vegetables, lettuce, cheese, various salsa options, etc) and sauces (Tacorrito sauce or sour cream, or guac at an additional fee).  I had a steak taco and a chicken burrito to compare options and quality. I will say I liked the steak more than the chicken, but regardless of meat choice I'm not exactly excited about a place that has the meat sitting in trays that is simply scooped into the shell of choice and covered in toppings. It certainly didn't taste fresh and really wasn't that warm. The chicken burrito was at least a warmer temperature since they actually put the burrito on a hot press to enclose the tortilla wrap vs just sticking the taco in a box once filled with toppings, but unfortunately the chicken was pretty bland and the more room temperature taco was actually better tasting than the warmed burrito.  So really, a bland burrito vs cold taco. This is not really the value proposition I'm looking for in a meal."}
{"text":"These Mexican burrito spots are blowing up and this is just another one located at Church and Wellesley. Having tried the likes of Chipotle, Z-Teca, Burrito Boyz, and Burrito Bandidos, this has to be the least favourable one.  I will say that I didn't have the burrito, but the burrito bowl. Choice of rice, beans, peppers, some toppings, along with 2 meats. One big bonus - no upcharge for choosing two meats (I decided on the pulled pork and steak). Threw on some salsa, beans and off I went with $9 less in my pocket.   Overall. the taste was meh - the spice level was great with the spicy salsa, but the rest was just plain and not really enjoyable. I was excited for a new burrito spot in my neighbourhood and maybe that contributed to my high expectations. Or it could be the numerous of other similar restaurants that will get you a more satisfying meal for the same price. Regrettably, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I get it, Toronto. I get it now.  Wasn't sure why everyone was crazy about tacos. I didn't get the hype. The only food I felt so passionately about was mac and cheese.  I tried Tacorrito with a friend. We got take out, so I can't comment on the dine-in experience.  The chicken tacos were so delicious! I never wanted them to end. I was already planning my next trip to tacorrito before I had even finished my tacos.  Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Food is tasteless. It's Almost like a crap chipotle  knock off meets Taco Bell. Lunch cafeteria line up that is not appealing to the eye or taste buds. Employee's behind counter are actually quite rude. Taco-crapo. Skip this place."}
{"text":"They were good at first but things just went downhill. I've been there enough to make me not wanna go back anymore. I first went during their opening and it was a 4/5 experience for me. And then the other times either their service sucked and/or their food was average-ish. I might forgive the service but if their food was not good enough to keep me coming back. Sorry Tacorrito, not."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place as I was walking back from the Beer Store (scored myself some change to spend).  I ordered a mixed meat burrito. It wasn't spicy enough for me. There was no flavour in the meat and no burrito sauce. It was about $9 (including tax) for this. Everything was cooked fine and the burrito was pressed, I just would not order a burrito here again.  Mexican food is my usual go-to choice anyhow, I might give this place another try if I were in the area. They have different daily specials for better value."}
{"text":"Meh... I didn't like my burrito, actually, I didn't even felt so good after eating here. My wife didn't have a problem with her bowl but wasn't great either. The chips don't even come with salsa and if you get a Groupon you can't upgrade the can soda to a Jarritos."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant. First off, I don't think the air conditioning was working properly in the location. Second, there was only one person working so the wait was pretty substantial. I decided to order the chicken burrito. I was really disappointed the meat wasn't hot and the rice was hard. Also we received chips with the order BUT it didn't include salsa. I thought that was really strange. The best part was the churros which have a filling. I wouldn't return to this location even with a Groupon available."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a dream in which you are doing something simple but you are  moving as if you are underwater? At tacorrito you can witness what that looks like in real life.  When I came in there were two female patrons waiting in front of the counter while a couple of guys were talking to the cashier.  As I took my place in line a quickly realized that the guys at the front were complaining about the service before walking out with nothing in their hands. The guy they were scolding walked into the kitchen and out of sight while his colleague milled about,  ignoring the three people in line. I then notices that there were four empty slots where ingredient buckets would obviously go,  and there isn't a lot of option to begin with. Now this is a situation  where I would expect the taco artists to be in full apologetic mode and rushing around to correct the situation,  yet the most animated they got was when the spoke to each other casually in Hindi.  Finally the guy fills the buckets one by agonizing one and they work on the two girls quesadillas lackadaisically. I'm up,  oh wait,  no  so fast,  more puttering to do.  When they get down to making my large burrito she asks me if I want to add guacamole for an extra charge.  I remind her that vegetarian burritos get free guacamole as the sign she stands under every day would suggest. She dips a tablespoon into pureed avocado slop and drops it unceremoniously into the exact centre of a large burrito.  When I get to the cash,  he says it's 10.16$.I hand the guy a twenty.  He asks me if I have change.  Weird but whatever,  I pass him a quarter.  He says \"actually,  all we have is twenties in the drawer,  do you mind paying with debit\"?  I dont see that I have much of a choice,  do I? I pay with my card and stifle a laugh when it asks me how much I want to tip. I the  do the most uncanadian thing we know how to do: when he passes me the bag,  I don't say thank you..   Total time of what I thought would be a 5 minute transaction: 25 minutes.   I would give this place one star had the burrito not been satisfactory.    If the employees' uncle or whoever got them the job is reading this, crack the whip."}
{"text":"@TacorritoCanada #TACORRITORICHMOND #BURRITO #TACORRITO  Let's just say Burrito Boys does it better. Much better.  Firstly, the Tacorrito website is unappetizing to say the least. It's nice that they are utilizing social media though; they do this weekly photo contest on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. And they are using Ritual (Sign Up for free food!! Promo Code: ANKITA5138). Good on them for getting the promo \"awn.\"   And.. they have the daily specials now, thank god. Take away promos and these specials, and Tacorrito becomes too expensive for what it offers. The small burrito is really small for $6.99. For that price, I can pick up a filling sub from he neighbourhood Subway, or a burger from the neighbourhood South St Burger. You'd be spending over $10 for a combo at this place easy. For what it's worth, the burrito is tasty yet unimpressive. And guacamole is an additional $1. What Mexican place charges an additional fee for Guac?   I'll probably be back since there's no Burrito Boys around the area. I'll even take Chipotle over this."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I were deciding on a place to try for lunch and came across Tacorrito. It gets fairly busy during the lunch rush, but the staff were quick to get the line moving.  I ordered 2 tacos (spicy fish & chicken), both were very filling and the guac definitely gave it that authentic feel. My colleague ordered a large burrito and it was gigantic! They packed it in quite good.  I recommend coming here as they have a decent variety of menu options, staff are friendly and very accommodating. I would visit again."}
{"text":"Another day, another burrito to try.  I'd walked by this joint many, many times before, but on this particular day I was messing around with the Ritual app and noticed a listing for Tacorrito. Done.  I decided to go with a medium pulled pork burrito, which I had stuffed with lime cilantro rice, black beans, saut√©ed vegetables, hot salsa, and guacamole. (The latter of which I had to pay extra for. Sigh.)  I'll admit the first couple of bites were quite impressive. The hot-all-the-way-through burrito seemed to have a good amount of each component, and the pulled pork was quite tender and tasty. But as I got further and further into the wrapped concoction, I began to notice a preponderance of the aforementioned lime cilantro rice and my enthusiasm began to wane considerably. There were a few bites there that seemed to be only rice, and the burrito itself began to fall apart in the middle due to an overuse of this particular ingredient.  It's a shame, really, because this did have the potential to become an above-average example of food item that's long-since saturated the Toronto market. (I especially enjoyed the saut√©ed veggies, which should totally be a more prominent element within these types of burritos.)"}
{"text":"When I worked at Bloor-Islington Place and was really hungry, I would go down and get the small beef burrito ($6.99). I have absolutely no complaints as everything was fresh and they really loaded it up with meat and all the fixings. In addition, the service was always good. My colleague, however, once got some tacos and she said they were quite pricey for what she received. For me though, no complaints!"}
{"text":"So i had a burrito bowl, definitely overpriced, very little in a \"large\" burrito bowl and the pulled pork was horrifying, it looked almost like canned tuna and leaked water like it was canned too. There was no iconic pulled pork bbq sauce either so I don't understand why they don't market it as \"cat food\" because what they have there isn't really \"pulled pork\".  Typical customizable stuff, had some black beans, pinto beans brown rice, nothing really shined, I suppose their chopped jalapenos and coriander were reasonably fresh. Aside from that not really the best. I wouldn't come again though the staff are reasonably friendly."}
{"text":"my beef taco was niagara falls, but of oil you'll need cutlery  decent spicy fish but the strips' consistency was like canned tuna's  overall? not bad large portions at small prices points off for flour shells"}
{"text":"Not good and overpriced.  Ordered 2 tacos and was surprised that it wasn't truly \"made to order\".  Meat was pre-cooked so who knows when it was actually cooked! Tortillas were heated up but not the meat???  You gotta pay more for guac which isn't cool. Also the music was so loud and the guy who worked there had a thick accent so just ordering was a challenge.  This place has potential which is why I didn't give it 1-star but I don't see it lasting very long under the current business model.   There are a billion other taco places in Toronto you should check out before this place."}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so low. This place was much better than expected. Generous portions and fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"We ordered nachos and it ended up being that yellow squirt cheese. Thinking that management would understand we ask them to redo the order and put real cheese due to an allergy. They had said that they don't do this. Followed by them slamming the plate of nachos on the table and storming into the back. Probably some of the worst service I have ever seen."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon, mainly in desperation because I had to pick something in Groupon before my credits expired.  There is no convenient place to park around this area and I thought I could just pull over and pick up something quick.  I turned out to be a half hour ordeal to order burritos and tacos.  The worker there did not have the app to scan the Groupon, so 10 minutes later and after re-parking my car, she had the app but it still didn't work.  She asked if my Groupon was still good, whether it is for this particular location, and then she had the audacity to suggest that the Groupon had already been redeemed.  Finally, the owner approved the transaction and I realized the food remaining at 6pm at Tacorrito looks awful.  Seriously, a health inspector should check this place out.  This experience caused me a lot of anxiety.  My chest physically hurts after taking out the food.  After consumption, I felt sick, and my friend did not have a good night.  Just don't do it.  Let your Groupon expire."}
{"text":"Food is tasty but the way the prep line works the food is cold by the time you get it.  Great idea, needs better execution."}
{"text":"Ugh. It takes a lot for me to give a place one star, but this was not good. Not good at all.  Initially I was lured in by their churros and ice cream sign. I walked in and thought I might as well eat too. I looked over the menu and decided. I had to wait because the guy was on the phone and then he began to take my order.  This is a small taco shop which lets you make burrito bowls, burritos and customized tacos. Since I got ice cream, or wanted it, I thought \"let's be healthy and go with the bowl\".  When scooping the rice I noticed it sticking to the pan- not good. I ordered the bowl with veggies, chicken and the rest of their toppings.  The bowl was terrible. I hate saying that word when it's about food or a business but it was. As suspected, the rice was crunchy. The chicken was old and dry. The one tasty part was the salsa but after maybe three bites I was done.  The ice cream with churros really couldn't even save this. I had to wait because the machine wasn't working. When I got my ice cream it was already sort of melted. The flavor was great, but poorly executed.  Not a good first impression and sadly this will be the only impression."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new, and after spending some time walking around the village, we ended up at Tacorrito. With a nice variety of meat and vegetarian options...it seemed like a good idea at the time.   Overall, the food wasn't bad. However, the price really didn't stand up to the quality of the food. When you spend upwards of $30 for two people (2 burritos, 2 drinks), you expect more than a mediocre taste.   I don't like spice whatsoever, but my partner loves it...and she was disappointed on  the lack of levels of actual spice (that they were proud enough to paint on the wall) didn't show up when talking with the staff.   The chicken wasn't as fresh as I'd like it, and the rice lacked flavour.   With the overall number of options in the downtown core for burritos, I wouldn't recommend this location, but I also wouldn't speak against it as it wasn't the worst."}
{"text":"For a fast food joint, pretty darn good. They were quick and we had a huge group. It was chipotle style. You pick what you want, burrito, tacos, quesadillas, etc. then your meats and toppings. I got the quesadilla and they even put beans, lettuce, onions, etc in them which was not what I was use to coming from America. These extras only enhanced the flavors!   I asked for their spiciest sauce which was their salsa and it did not disappoint! It was actually spicy and again surprised me! I tolerate spicy very well so usually when restaurants say spicy, it barely makes a dent. Overall, pretty impressed by the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"Not too bad and there aren't too many burrito places around to compete (but there will be soon so things should get interesting...)  Bowl is a bit small but from what I can tell, it's about the same size as Chipotle. Price was OK but I got a Ritual discount. If not for that, I might have complained about the portion size.  Taste was fine, nothing exciting but also nothing bad to say about it.   They forgot to give me a fork in my take out bag and I was blocks away when I found out, which was kind of annoying.  Not likely to go back, I'd rather get the Oaxaco bowl at Freshii, it's pretty comparable in taste and a bit bigger."}
{"text":"Went there for their opening weekend and absolutely loved it. Since then, I've been three other times around the dinner rush and have been moderately disappointed. After all, I live 10 stories above them. Meats that should be tender (pork \"carnitas\" for example) aren't - although the chicken was pretty on point. Salsas have inconsistent quality (translucent, tasteless tomato in the pico-style mild salsa) and heat levels (tomatillo green salsa has ranged from habanero hot to poblano level hot). Recently, many of the ingredients have been woefully under-seasoned, though as a chef myself, perhaps my salt preference is a bit high.   Oh, and the tortilla chips are typically stale.  All in all, not worth 13$ for a coke, large burrito and some stale chips. You can get a much better burrito two blocks down the street. Sorry Tacoritto, I'll probably cave again - but it won't be for awhile... I'll grab a 5$ footlong at the Subway next to you before almost tripling my food cost."}
{"text":"The meat was well marinated, I had the chicken. The toppings and hard toco shell tasted as if they came out of an Old El Paso jar. The hard taco shell was dried out as well. Friendly service , but with all the taco places available in Toronto, this one falls short."}
{"text":"Absolute joke. This food makes supermarket El Paso stuff taste like fine dining. How can you even call the crap you serve a taco? Disgusting, cold, sloppy, flavourless mess. Even tortilla didnt taste like tortilla. Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"The soft tacos were underwhelming. As expected, the meat carried the dish but it should not be the case as the condiments and sides should compliment the meat and taco shell.   The shell was bland and cold with an insanely small trickle of salsa to go with the taco.   The pulled pork and beef were ok at best and the chicken was dry and flavourless.  You could've made these tacos yourselves for much cheaper.   tl;dr: skip this place, much better taco options elsewhere"}
{"text":"Tacoalrighthough? 3.5.   I ordered 3 tacos - all different meats, chips & salsa, and the churros.   The tacos came in the box in a pool of liquid (water likely) at the bottom so they were a little soggy when I was eating them. The taste? Not bad. I'm sure that they would have tasted better without the excess fluids, but I still enjoyed them.   Churros were great actually; I'm a big fan of cinnamon and these certainly hit the spot after my meal. They come in a pair and it's probably what I'd come back for from here funny enough.   The salsa was HOT. I was eating them after the tacos and I was thinking to myself, \"Oh wow, those tacos were spicy I'm still feeling it!\" I had some water to settle the heat, but only later realized that the heat was coming from the salsa I was eating. So keep that in mind folks!"}
{"text":"I almost walked by this place on my way to TIm Horton's for my lunch break. I'm glad it caught my eye. I had the small quesadilla  (which wasn't all that small) and the churros. It may not be exactly authentic but it beats the monotony of the Starbucks-Tims visits. The prices aren't great, so it won't be a regular thing, but I can't say I was disappointed in the food! I'd go back."}
{"text":"Decent burrito!  Not a great deal of toppings but overall the meat is good and a nice burrito."}
{"text":"My experience could of have been better. Ordered on just eat and it was cold & soggy when it arrived so didn't get to enjoy it."}
{"text":"New to the hood so we hit it up for lunch Monday.  I arrived before my friend which gave me time to try and decipher the backward menu board.  I presume the figured  their line-up started at the back of the restaurant so the three step menu board is install with step one on the right - totally counter-intuitive!  (My buddy needed it explained!  lol)    I told the very young, (and very blonde...) girls I was waiting for a friend and would like some nachos with guac while I waited.  This created a confusion as they thought they were out of guac (at the beginning of lunch  hour) then had to wrap their pretty heads around it going on a plate, not in a bag...  After my friend arrived and after I explained the confusing menu boards...I turned to the girl and said: \"I  would like the medium Chicken Quesadilla please.\"  The young girl started to prepare it - a very awkward process apparently, then the million dollar question:  The 'girl': \"What type of meat would you like on that?\"   Me (again):  \"I  would like the medium Chicken Quesadilla please.\"  The 'girl': \"Yes, I know, but what type of meat do you want, we have chicken, beef, pulled pork or vegetarian.\"  [I guess vegetarian in her world is a meat?]  Me: \"I prefer chicken on my Chicken Quesadilla please.\"  (I'm struggling not to roll my eyes or use my Valley Girl accent here.)  The 'girl':  (Looking a bit perplexed)  uh, ok....  The came the slow awkward process of making it, three staff inquiring if I had been served, and if it was to go or to stay...  So the food was good.  No complaints, and right size for me.  And they would likely make a killing on the weekends after the bars - although I think the current staff might last about 20 minutes until some patron lost it...  OK they are NEW - I hope they get it right fast.  We need new spots in the village."}
{"text":"the \"1 stars\" are not even remotely fair at all. the price line is reasonable, the food was average. food prep area and the restaurant were very clean and maintained. would def eat here again to try something else on the menu :)"}
{"text":"CAFETERIA FOOD! STAY AWAY!   I'm an idiot for not checking Yelp first..    I saw they had a fish taco special (3 tacos) for 5.99. I was really excited to try it out considering the seemingly fair price.   First of all, the \"taco\" they used was worse than a no name brand you could buy at the grocery store, they charge for guacamole (the only other ingredient besides cheap beans, salsa, and lettuce. the sour cream was super watery, the whole taco was FREEZING, and the whole thing tasted like it was full of Tostitos salsa. I legit didn't even want to finish the other 2 tacos after the first one. I can't believe someone would open up a restaurant and charge people for extremely poor food. GO TO BURRITO BOYS... Or anywhere else. Id prefer Taco Bell over this place. Do yourself a favour and don't even bother. Really gross  The only nice thing I can say about this place is that the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Got a burrito bowl. Expecting it to be like chipotle's (though I didn't have that high of an expectation). Their ingredients were lacking in choice. Besides the chicken, everything  was very meh. The grilled chicken was good but they give you like a small spoonful. If you think chipotles is skimping on their servings, skip this place. My bowl was like half filled by the time it was done and it was $10. Would not be back."}
