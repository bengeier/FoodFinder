{"text":"Pretty generic barbecue. Nothing special. There was no atmosphere, even the servers looked bored."}
{"text":"I wish I can rate zero star for the rudest service in the world unless the old wrinkled waitress is a racist (then there is an excuse maybe?) we were waiting outside to be seated when she pointed at me and said: you! Come seat in there. I'm like, emmm it's rude but I guess it just her personality so I didn't say anything and just followed her into the restaurant (should be a red flag here). After I sat down for 3 minutes, she suddenly came back and loudly asked us to leave the table in such a rude manner because of there were people before us? Without apology even it's her part of fault? This is so humiliating cause she was being very loud, even lady sat next table spoke for us but this waitress just insisted we need to go back to waiting room then she just WALKED AWAY? Dear futur customers, if you don't want to take the risk of being humiliated in front of everyone, better watch out."}
{"text":"wow a great find  the bbq sauce with the ribs was delicious   chicken sweet and juicy located near busy downtown  eat upstairs   portions are large  ribs are so sweet    lots of fries   yes they do taste like chinese ribs   old fashion grumpy waitress was a plus   limited beer selection   need lots of napkins"}
{"text":"Seriously unpretentious and tasty AF. Wait staff is super friendly and fun. You want no bullshit tasty BBQ ribs and chicken this is the place in Montreal."}
{"text":"Je connais ce restaurant depuis près de 40 ans. A une certaine époque, il y avait bien peu de restaurants offrant des ribs.

J'y suis retourné en après midi, le jour de la fête des mères, je m'attendais à faire la queue à l'extérieur comme dans le temps.

Aucune queue, un restaurant au trois quart vide et un atmosphère triste. J'ai commandé le grand plat de ribs avec frite et un deuxième riz aux tomates.

J'ai parlé avec la serveuse qui m'a dit être là depuis bien des années et que la seule chose qui avait changé avec le temps était le prix des plats.

Malheureusement, ce n'est pas la réalité. Dans ma vie, je suis allé certainement plus de 200 fois dans ce Resto et je peux dire que bien des choses ont changées.

Les ribs sont beaucoup plus petites et avec moins de viande, la cuisson laisse à désirer, elle ne sont plus aussi tendres que par le passé.

Nous sommes loin de l'époque où mon voisin de table, un journaliste qui accompagnait les Dodgers de Los Angeles qui visitaient les Expos, me disait que les meilleurs ribs en Amérique étaient au Bar B Barn de Montréal.

On a diminué la quantité, augmenté les prix et on présente maintenant un produit moyen. La compétition est forte et il suffirait de revenir en arrière pour redonner à ce Resto sa réputation perdue.

J'ai retenté ma chance au Bar B Barn de Dollard-des-Ormeaux... la déception a continué!

Je ne sais pas si je vais y retourner et je le dit avec beaucoup de tristesse.

Je m'attend à une fermeture de ce Resto, des salles vides ne lui permettront pas de survivre.

Je me rappellerai toujours les bons moments que j'y ai passé!"}
{"text":"This was an experience to forget I had thought with the positive reviews on here it would be decent but I was wrong and these people have no taste buds or are a bit challenged to give this dive anymore than 2 stars, the chicken breast was so dry that I had to give it a drink of water lol the  ribs were ok if they would have left the gross sweet bbq sauce in the kitchen I didn't like the bbq sauce or service everything I asked of was $.50 to a $1 extra forget this place it's garbage on top of it all I had to wait after asking 15 minutes for my bill"}
{"text":"Very family friendly place. The decor is very unique and shows history. Their lunch special of either spare ribs or chicken is very tasting and reasonably priced! The waitress is very friendly and helpful! She made great food recommendations. Great place for everyone!!"}
{"text":"Cool small place. Just went in there for a bite by myself on a weekday and was helped to a seat anywhere. They have sports channels on big HD tvs. Room is small and cosy like . Feels like an inn. But the ribs r great , the other items seem like it was frozen and they just reheat it . Doesn't feel like restaurant food but instead if feels like frozen food that is reheated in the back. 

The pricing is pretty decent to and menu is not too complicated. 

The other bar b barn in Montreal is better but the food should taste the same (because I think it's frozen) .

Check it out if ur down for ribs!!"}
{"text":"Really gone down over the years. I had the ribs, it was covered in a sauce that was overly sweet. The meat was hard and very dry, and burnt. A couple of pieces I just couldn't even eat. It felt like I was gnawing on a bone of bad pork jerky. I don't know if they were trying to hide how bad the meat was with the overuse of sauce. This place used to be good, don't know what happened."}
{"text":"I had half a hawg and oh my gosh...these were the best ribs i've ever eaten. The ribs have a smoky sweet flavor, loved the fries!!! I can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend that grew up in Montreal.  Ordered the combo ribs and chicken and was a hearty portion size.  The meat has lots of flavour and didn't need any fancy hipster named BBQ sauces to cover up the precooked blandness like at the other chic BBQ joints.  After eating at all the tourist smoke meat chain restaurants, this was a nice change and good value."}
{"text":"Having lived and travelled extensively in the southern United States, I consider myself somewhat knowledgable on good BBQ.

Please STAY AWAY from Bar B.  Food was horrible!!! Service was good, but this is not a fair representation of what BBQ is. Save your time and money and DO NOT come here. You will leave disappointed. 

Dry chicken/ weird overly sweet ribs. The rice was horrible and the mashed potatoes are fake.

If you do decide to ignore my advice, then it is at the risk of your taste buds."}
{"text":"This is not barbecue. It's not even bad barbecue. 
To start with the ribs are not smoked. 
They taste like they are sauced in teriyaki and sugar. No flavour at all. 
The \"Spanish\" rice tastes like chef Boyardee. 
The fries are frozen. 
Barbecue in Canada is notoriously bad but this takes it to a whole new level. 
I felt like I was dining at the old folks home. 

The decor and ambience are laugh out loud atrocious which would be fine if the food was amazing.   Those yellow lights make everything look jaundiced. 

I was embarrassed for the server who was apparently and rightfully afraid to ask if we were happy with our meals. 

I won't be going back there. 

I'm afraid good barbecue just does not exist in Montreal. I'm spoiled though. Lived ten years in the States though where it's hard to find bad barbecue."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best ribs I have ever eaten. This place is a must every trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Having eaten at Bar B Barn at each of my 5 prior trips to Montreal, this time was very disappointing.  First of all, the restaurant was empty on a Monday night, which made us feel like we were imposing even though they were open for another hour.  The server was nice, but not overly helpful. Secondly, the ribs were not as good as they have been in the past.  They were too fatty, with little actual meat.  I think the ribs were boiled instead of smoked to tenderize the meat.  Additionally, they were not as big as I remember from past experiences.  The sauce is good, but with good ribs the sauce should compliment but not overpower the meat.
The place has character from great Canadians' memorabilia.  However, it looks like it needs a  good cleaning."}
{"text":"What a trip down memory lane for me. I am a hard core BBQ lover and believe there is only two kinds of BBQ good and better. This place has a unique sweet glaze which I remember from growing up and still enjoy. The decor is a bit divey but it always has been which is fine by me. 
Will I be back absolutely and hope this place will be here."}
{"text":"Oh my YUM. Best ribs in the city..no, in the world!! I just love this place so so much that I really have to have a lot of will power not to waltz into it whenever my heart desires..

The calories in these plates are definitely through the roof but are so worth it. Absolutely deliciously succulent ribs that can't be beat. Cool homey ambiance, and veeerry decent prices. My mouth is watering just writing about this.....

The portions are quite large, so be careful when ordering (that's not to say that I haven't devoured their largest size on more than one occasion.......)..This is not really the place to come for chicken, although a few friends of mine have ordered it and haven't had any complaints.

But, if you love ribs, and don't mind making an absolute mess, this is a must try restaurant! 

yum yum yum yum.."}
{"text":"Pretty good. VERRY sweet but I'm known for loving overly sweet things. Over cooked if you ask me and the ribs didn't fall off the bone as others. Not the best ribs I've had. Also extremly dark inside almost ridiculous. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"The owners transplanted from the States and set up this Montreal landmark that's been around since the 1970's!

Solid BBQ.. served in a barn! Well, it looks and feels like a barn -- if a barn were two stories smack dab in the middle of a major metropolis. Very homey and down to earth, absolutely nothing fancy or hip-and-happening.

If you're tired of all the fancy French food and French women and French beer (yeah, craziness I'm sure), you can come here for a slab of Americana. Their portions will blow you away. They only serve two things: roast chicken or ribs. Men: order \"The Whole Hog\" and prepare to be humbled. So good, but you'll never finish it all.

P.S. Whatever you do, don't let your friends convince you to check out Baton Rouge. It's a Lousiana-style chain and it's pretty bad, especially their bland ribs. Bar-B-Barn or bust!"}
{"text":"There are many places in the city that offer this kind of fare, such as St-Hubert BBQ, Chalet BBQ, La Cage, Swiss Chalet, etc. I tried Bar B Barn hoping to get a different take. The service was fine, the atmosphere was fun. The food was weird. My bun was stale. My fries were average. The tomato sauce and rice side is not better than coleslaw. But most importantly, the ribs are super sugary. I like dry ribs. If my ribs are covered in sauce, it would be nice if it were savory BBQ sauce. This was just liquid sugar."}
{"text":"Step into a time machine and travel back to the 70s in this nostalgic diner. This is a place to get a bunch of food for not too much money.
I had the combo platter, which came with a quarter rotisserie chicken and 3 ribs, plus fries, seasoned rice, bun and dipping sauce. The chicken was good, nice flavour, the ribs were really good, tender with a nice sauce. The fries tasted exactly like McCain superfries, the dipping sauce is pretty good, and service is friendly.
The walls are plastered with pictures of members of the great Habs team of the 70s, and really, the food hasn't moved past that period either. But when you have a good thing, why change it?"}
{"text":"You really need to be in the mood for the Bar-B rib spot. It's been around for a very long time and it's starting to show it's age. The staff is old and the place could use a serious face lift and a menu change. The prices are tourist trap prices so do go there looking for a value meal.  It's best not to get too many ribs because the taste gets lost with the sweet sauce."}
{"text":"every time I go to the belle provence, I go to the barn, get the ribs,krinkle fries and 1/4 chicken combo, comes with a roll and rice and sauce....awesome ribs...go watch the leafs beat the habs at the bell centre as desert......"}
{"text":"I was recommended by some friends to stop by Bar-B-Barn in Montreal.  Definitely the best spot in the city to grab some ribs with friends.  The atmosphere is wonderful, and it has this homey feel to it with the old decor when you first walk in. The service we received was very good. The ribs were tender and slightly sweet, and the onion rings were spot on with it's crispiness! I would definitely go back to this place the next time i'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"This is probably the 3rd time I tried it. It never change and it still good. Most people think ribs has to be very tender and falling of bones and style. There are so many different ways to make ribs tasty. It's also the atmosphere that makes the food tasty. Service is great this time. You need to try a restaurant 2-3 times to judge sometime."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I am going to Bar B Barn. Compared to the first time, this experience was VERY disappointing.

The good: As we wait for our table of six to be ready, the barman (who started working that night) was very entertaining and friendly. He did a good job keeping us occupied while we waited, and he was working hard. Ribs were still good and tasty (no fat). Waitress was friendly with us.

The bad: Chicken was dry. Mashed potatoes had no taste at all, no taste. Rice was not good, felt like it came from a can. When we arrived, manager was rude with us when we asked for a table for six people. Waitresses were rude to the barman, in our face, even though this was his first night on the job (unacceptable!) My wife ordered a drink which the waitress forgot and tried to blame it on the barman (we saw everything, and it was her fault for forgetting). I personally think it is expensive for a combo of ribs and chicken breast (that was dry).

The only reason why we go there is because of family that comes from Calgary and wishes to eat there. If not, we know better places that serves good ribs and chicken, but with better service."}
{"text":"These are the best ribs in town!  I've eaten here half a dozen times.  I hear they have chicken too...never tried it as the rib portion is humongous!!  You must go.  Casual place, jeans are fine.  Decor is dated but part of the atmosphere for a great rib joint!  Unbelievably fast with the meals too, service is great.

I've spent a fair bit of time down South.  These are not the same kind of BBQ as you get in the Southern US, not really apples to apples.

Compared to most of the US, and Canadian rib joints I've been to, these are great!"}
{"text":"Great ribs but a bit pricy. I also didn't like that you couldn't order a half rack on its own. You have to get a meal with it. All in all I was satisfied with the food though."}
{"text":"If you like ribs this is the place to eat them. I had the combo ribs and chicken. The ribs were very tasty and fall off the bone.  Sarah our waitress suggested squeezing lemon juice on them.  What a totally different delicious flavour. The chicken was tasty and moist also."}
{"text":"I had the combo plate, which includes 3 ribs, a chicken leg, a piece of bread, rice and lots of fries. While the ribs taste good, the chicken tastes exactly like the barbecued chicken from grocery deli in Ontario: very salty skin and insipid meat. Also very pricey. Not recommended."}
{"text":"delicious! I just went a few days ago for the 3rd time in the last couple of months and the quality is the same. I can live without the rice but I don't come to this place to eat rice. The fries are very crispy. I read a couple of comments with 1 star and that looks fishy. Is impossible that my ribs were amazing and others have big issues. Seems like competition writing comments. The waitresses are very nice and come to check once on you each time."}
{"text":"I  went there countless times. All props goes to friend Arielle for bringing me here 3 years ago. Amazing juicy ribs, the staff is really nice and the service is fast plus they have free wifi. The place is not super trendy but you know you get real food at a reasonable price. 
The only thing im not a fan of is their \" ketchup rice \" other than that nothing to add."}
{"text":"How can you be the king of ribs when you walk in on a Wednesday at 19:00, have to wait 20 minutes and not be guaranteed to have ribs when you order ?
Lame..."}
{"text":"I really liked the feel when walking into this place and the service was friendly too. I really really wanted to like the food here. However, the best word I can use to describe the food is FUNKY. I don't think a barbecue participated at all in the making of the food. Furthermore, it arrived cold and the ribs were covered with an odd sauce. Maybe just a bad day?"}
{"text":"This is definitely not the place to go for ribs. It's where the Americans go to eat ribs. The ribs actually taste like spire ribs that you eat at a Chinese restaurant and i'm pretty sure they sure frozen fries. They served your plate with a bread and some kind of Mexican rice that tastes like tomatoes.

I do not recommend this place to amateurs of ribs."}
{"text":"Woe what? I haven't reviewed one of my favorite pits to find delicious ribs yet? Where was I? Well let's get started. Anyone who knows the history of the Bar B Barns knows that it was opened during the year of the expo and they never renovated since then. Most of the original wait staff still works there today (kidding about the wait staff part). Now you don't go there for the ambiance and the ridiculously disgusting and horrible décor. You go there for one thing and one thing alone, THE RIBS. Everything else is passé and not very tasty and really, who the fuck cares, you're here for the ribs remember? Like the Metallica song goes... and nothing else matters. 

See you don't get those tiny baby back ribs from Scores here. Here you get the option of either the Baby Hawg (3 ribs), The Half Hawg (6 ribs) and the insane Full Hawg (9 ribs). Now yer thinking, at Scores I gets me 24 baby back ribs, hows this any good? Well it's 3 large meaty ribs straight from Hog Heaven. Trust me when I say; \"I can eat\" and the Baby Hawg combo is plenty of grub for this foodie. Comes with fries (which look like crinkle cut McCain fries), one or two crunchy onion ring, and a side of tomatoey rice, bun and a soft drink. The fries are average; the rice thing is sometimes edible but those ribs... those ribtastic delicious pieces of candied pig on a bone. It's the most wonderful thing. Have had better ribs? Hell yeah. But these ribs are cooked for, I think, 12 or more hours and slathered with an applesauce based BBQ sauce and that's the winner.  When I say candied pig, I wasn't kidding. These suckers are cooked for ever and the BBQ sauce is literally candied into the pork. You eat these babies dry, no sauce, no nothin' because they are as perfect as they get.

In the end everything else could stand some serious improvement. How about hand cut fries? Or a real crunchy slaw? How about a coat of fucking paint on those shitty walls? But the deliciously awesome ribs make up for all those flaws. IT'S RIBS, MAN!"}
{"text":"Great staff! SO FRIENDLY. Lovely ladies who really try to make it fun for you. We brought our son here (1.5 yrs) and they really made it nice for him as well. Gave us a big table with lots of space, crayons, a lollipop etc. It feels like family here and the food is REALLY GOOD. The ribs fall off the bone with ease, and the chicken drum stick for our son was perfect. Easy to get off the one so he could eat with his hands and partake in all the messiness too! Such a fun time."}
{"text":"I used to know a Canadian who would brag that this place had the best ribs.  So of course, when I made a trip up there from the States, I had to check it out.  As soon as I walked in, I noticed the pictures of all the celebrities, mostly hockey players, who visited over the years.  So I thought to myself, this place must be as good as advertised.  

I ordered the Whole Hawg, which is a full rack of ribs.  All I can say is these are the worst ribs I have ever eaten.  What the hell is that diarrhea they glazed the ribs with?  I'll tell you what it was.  It was a low quality soy or teriyaki sauce mixed with honey.  The whole thing was a dark and sticky mess that tasted like really bad Chinese or Japanese food served at a cafeteria.  And if that wasn't bad enough, the meat was greasy.

Everything is cooked on a gas-fired rotisserie, so I wouldn't really call this BBQ.  At least not the American standard for BBQ.  But if this is Canada's idea of BBQ, they can keep it.

The poulet was only a little better than the ribs, but not by much.  With such lousy food, I can't believe this place has been around for so long."}
{"text":"We went here during our visit from MA because our friend remembered it from when he was a kid (early 90s) visiting for hockey games.The atmosphere is fun before a hockey games - tons of hockey fans (Bruins and Habs fans) packed the second floor of this place. It really is a barn - very casual place.

Ribs were pretty good but very sweet, tomato-y rice was gross, crinkles fries were most likely from the freezer and the chicken was OK. I couldn't believe the prices -- their combo meal was over $20. A little steep for \"barbecue.\" If you are looking for traditional barbecue - this is not the place to go. 

I think this is the perfect divey place for a beers - but not for food."}
{"text":"This place is an institution. Forget Schwartz's or La Banquise, when you come to Bar-B-Barn, you're eating history. 

Walk in from either entrance and you're greeted with friendly service and the mouthwatering aroma of gloriously glazed ribs. Sit down, and the options are limited but simple: what sized rack do you want and what are your sides going to be? You could opt for chicken, but who are we kidding... you're here for the ribs. At the end of the day, my go-to is the half hog and fries, but any combo of ribs and fries will leave you satisfied. 

Heads up: the rice tomato sauce they serve is weird as shit but you're probably gonna finish it anyway. Smear it on a bun or just shoot it down the hatch, but don't leave the restaurant without getting some of it in your mouth. Because that would just be rude."}
{"text":"In fact this place is a time portal to the 1970's 
Great ribs. Awesome chiken, what are thoses spices they use? 
Nice staff, they treat you like family even if it's your first time visiting. 
Hey maybe it's not the first time! Who knows with the portal."}
{"text":"Before my husband and I were married, we spent a lot of time in Montreal and this was an annual stop when we would visit. Fast forward 16 years later, and this time we brought our kids! It was surreal! The place is exactly as we remembered it! Everything!  It is a no frills BBQ place with a simple menu but it is SO good! Our waitress was pleasant, attentive and efficient.  The kids loved it! The ribs, fries, onion rings, and rice were delicious. My son had a chicken burger that he really enjoyed. We were there on a late Saturday afternoon and when we arrived, it wasn't too busy, which was perfect and exactly what we were looking for. My daughter forgot her scarf there and as soon as she realized it and we turned to go back in, our waitress was running towards us with it! Thank you for a great time!"}
{"text":"Fun, casual place to eat with your friends. If you're looking for authentic Southern barbeque, move along, but if you want to chow down on some good cheap ribs and chicken, Bar-B-Barn fits the bill. 

We came here hoping to watch the hockey game (well, the guys wanted to watch the hockey game, and we girls were wanting a place that wasn't filled with drunk hockey lunatics) while eating dinner. No TV, so no dice, but the homey barn-y environment still made for a fun night. 

Good cheap ribs. The meat was pretty tender. Sweet sticky sauce. Mmmm. I got the small portion with three ribs and fries and that filled me up."}
{"text":"Could be the best Ribs in Canada but I haven't had many good ribs in Canada. I find it awkward when I travel back home to Montreal with American friends and Montrealers will start pushing Bar-B-Barn on the them. From My experience Bar-B-Barn can't compare to even a mediocre U.S. Rib. I'm shocked that there are some positve Yank Yelper reviews.

One thing that really pisses me off about this place is the small serving of fries and sauce that comes with most meals. What a rip."}
{"text":"I'm from Montreal, and I cant believe I never been here before. Heard a lot about this place through the years. Some say it's the beat ribs in the city while others say Bâton Rouge. In my book, the B's ribs are pretty amazing. The flavor was pretty unique for for. The Cheesecake is also onenof the best I had in a while.

Thus, I have to say that this place is unique within itsself - from inside out. For its area, the parking is a great add on. In addition, the proximity to the Bell Center makes it the best option over Cage Au Sport, St-Hubert.... Plus you can leave your car there to go to the game for a few extra bucks."}
{"text":"This place is hands down some of the best ribs and fresh barbucue chix i have tasted!  I got a combo and rib and chix plate and was very satisfied with what was very sweet mouth watering tender ribs...!  The waitress ws very nice and food cameout without hesitation...    I have been going back and fourth to this area for years and will always stop back from now on!"}
{"text":"Having lived in the South for seven years and having enjoyed Blue Ribbon BBQ here in Boston for over ten I can't say these are the best ribs ever.  They might be the best ribs in Canada.  In any case, they were pretty tasty.  

The ribs aren't smoked but have a nice sugar/sweet glaze on them.  The chicken was layered with BBQ sauce and very juicy (always a plus.)

This is also one of the few restaurants we've found that can handle a large crowd in Montreal, which is also a plus."}
