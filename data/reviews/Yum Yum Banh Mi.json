{"text":"Went here for the first time as I live close. I know they're new so I'll probably give them another chance. Today I got the Caramel Pork Belly sand which and the spring rolls. I don't recommend the sandwich. It was very fatty. Bread was stale. Spring rolls were okay. When I went they were out of almost everything; no Bubble Tea, no Lemonade, no lemon tea, no cold cuts and no beef. So I wasn't left with much of an option. Lady was kind of rude. I'll try it again maybe when they get their shit together."}

*************

I've been here 4 times now and the first time I went, my rating would have been a 4-5 considering this is a take-out place.

The prices are good ($4.00 for a sandwich, or 2 for $6.00) and the Pho is $6.00.)
Spring rolls are ($3.00 for 5pcs and $5.00 for 10pcs)

The good:
- the banh mi sandwiches are tasty and quick to make (little waiting)
- the flavour of the pho broth is good and there is a minimally \"decent\" amount of beef
- the fried spring rolls are fried fresh (not microwaved) and is tasty 
- they gave free iced lemon tea (the first visit) and it was very flavourful
- the iced coffee is strong and tasty
- the people are VERY friendly and welcoming


Needs work:
- all their meats seem to be ALL microwaved 
- the hot water used for the coffee was microwaved also
- it was very difficult to tell the pork from the chicken (maybe it was just me)
- the pho only had beef as the meats - so if you are looking for beef balls, tripe or any other traditional meats... no luck here
- both the iced lemon tea and iced coffee comes in a little styrofoam cup (as you would for a small coffee at an skating rink)
- it is cash only

I'll check in again in a few months. I will give Yum Yum Banh Mi one more try in the new year.

{"text":"I ordered the Caramel Pork Belly yesterday and I wasn't disappointed. Yum Yum is located in a European neighborhood. The few Asian food places in this area are not so great (the only other amazing Asian (Thai) place is Ranu on Lakeshore) and it's really nice to have a place like Yum Yum around so that I don't have to go far for my banh mi cravings. Their website says \"it's all about the bread\" and, yes, their bread is the best of all the banh mi places I've tried.

I only gave it 4 stars cuz I have yet to try their bubble tea (also something that I travel far for). If their bubble tea is not bad at all, I will update the stars to 5. If it disappoints, I will leave it at 4 stars."}
{"text":"Fairly new place. The Bahn Mi were pretty good and big..My only complaints are; they seemed to use the microwave a lot and it takes quite a while to get your food. I hope that people notice the place as it not the best location and too many restaurants & businesses have closed. Overall, good food and a nice change for New Toronto."}
{"text":"Really tasty authentic Vietnamese street food!  Banh mi with do chua. Great value for money.  Very friendly service and quirky graphics on the blackboards.  It's really nice to find a place like this so close to home."}
{"text":"Intrigued by the charmingly circa-1997 Geocities style website, I parked on the street on Islington to find a super brightly lit restaurant.  I had pre-ordered a cold cut and grilled pork banh mi, salad rolls and an order of spring rolls.  All were ready in a few minutes of my arrival.  Spring rolls were amazing and very freshly deep fried.  Wish they had some of that fermented fish dipping sauce though!  Salad rolls were very fresh, although I had been surprised to find one was wrapped in plastic wrap (I suspect so they wouldn't stick together- smart but unexpected!). And the banh mi were good although I found my bread to be a tinge stale and it was missing pate/mayo that I love!  Otherwise prices were amazing, the woman behind the counter was friendly, and overall everything had a very homemade taste to it.  I will definitely be back!!  (The lemongrass tofu looked intriguing!  Will try next time.). A solid 3.5 stars."}
