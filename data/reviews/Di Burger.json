{"text":"If you want a great burger at an extremely great price and you happen to live or be in Chateauguay, I would recommend Di Burger without blinking an eye. The service is quick, but don't mistake quickness for a lack of quality because the burgers are awesome. The poutine was great, but even for my wife and I, the small was more than big enough for the two of us."}
{"text":"Live near by and always drive by, thought it was a knock off of Diallo Burger and didn't want to expect one thing and be disappointed. Until....I read the reviews on Yelp of course!
So on my day off, I craved a \"real\" burger and decided to try it out. 
Was surprised by how big and clean the place was, the waitress was super friendly, and I think the guys in the back making our grub were actually the owners. Love that!
The menu was very similar to Diallo's, so I crossed my fingers. I ordered the burger with Capicollo & hot peppers along with a poutine to share with the hubby. He ordered the cheeseburger with extra meat. 
When our order came we dug in, and oh boy! We have a juicy, fresh, moist, burger in Chateauguay!!! My husbands burger was huge, and just as juicy, he ordered his wet and though it was juicy, it was not soggy:) 
The fries were ok, and the poutine passable, but the star is the burger! Delicious!! Please do not hesitate to try out this place. Go, go, now!!"}
{"text":"I ordered my burger dipped in \"jus\" and it arrived in under 5 minutes, prepared hot and fresh, and exactly how I ordered it. I've never tasted a burger this juicy, or this messy before. When I finished I had a pile of napkins on the table, but it was worth every bite. I intend to return again shortly."}
{"text":"I'm now giving this place  one star the owner wrote a fake Review or some  one that works for him or knows him or what ever.. you should contact the people who had bad experiences  and see what you could of done better . Instead you write a false review I hope it gets  deleted shame on you"}
{"text":"When I went with my girl friend we ordered 2 burger combos around 12:40pm, I ordered a jalapeno burger combo. Our burgers tasted rancid like they mixed fresh ground beef with some that just turned bad. The toppings were the best I ever had which made this place very disappointing when I tasted the beef. This was sold around the same time when the teenagers/adults are on their lunch break so I suggest you don't go there for your lunch. The fries were OK but nothing special, very greasy though but nothing a paper bag can't handle to take off the excess grease."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but lately they have gone down hill. last time I come back, giving customers spoiled meat is just going to far. Very disappointing."}
