{"text":"This place definitely earned its review from me. I've been going here for quite some time now and I am always happy when I walk out. The food is great, and it's clean too! The staff is really nice and they have pretty flexible hours. Portions are great and they are very generous if you ask for more (if you're a fatty like me! Lol) There isn't a crazy amount of variety. It's pretty much like your nearby Chipotle with some South Asian spice! But if you like your rice bowls as simple as I do, then you won't mind coming here."}
{"text":"I visited for the first time thanks to a hooked deal and boy am I glad to have discovered this GEM! I have chased good Indian food in Champaign-Urbana since my undergrad years (10 years ago) and this place does not disappoint. As soon as I walked in, I saw a lot of Indian customers so I knew it had to be good.   FOOD It's fast Indian food with quality flavors and ingredients. The portions are huge for an awesome price. I got the tacos because of the hooked deal, but it seemed like most people ordered the rice bowl (I want to try when I go back). You choose a protein, sauce (creamy tomato/korma), toppings, and more sauce to go on top. It's a mound of yummy goodness.   ATMOSPHERE Honestly, there is nothing fancy about the interior. Very casual, but clean! I was confused by the logo at first. If not for the hooked deal, I would have never known it to be an Indian place. If you are looking for a date spot or a nice sit-down Indian restaurant, I would recommend Kohinoor or Himalayan Chimney in downtown Champaign. However, on a casual night or for lunch, this would be my go to spot."}
{"text":"Indian fast food in the style of chipotle or other burrito shops. Paratha dosa tortilla or bowl with Indian spiced Chana (chickpea) chicken beef rice paint (Indian cheese) and other fillings plus Mexican style toppings like cheese salsa guacamole lettuce and tomato. I had a chickpea masala dosa. It was excellent. The basil seed infused drinks were also tasty."}
{"text":"I think of this place as an Indian version of Chipotle. You select your base (rice, dosa, etc), then the protein (chicken tikka, paneer, etc) and the respective sauce, and finally the fillings (veggies, chutneys and the like). I love the quality and quantity of this place, and it's my go-to right along with Bangkok Thai on campus. IMO the best Indian food on Green Street. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Big portions when you get the rice bowl. Guacamole is complimentary. In my opinion is the best bang per buck in Green St."}
{"text":"Signature Grill is a customizable, assembly-line, made to order restaurant that uses the Chipotle/Subway/Blaze concept and applies it to Indian food. The choices for base (lettuce, rice), protein, veggies, and sauces are simple but effective. The staff was very courteous and gave me some samples to test spiciness before ordering. The prices are also pretty cheap for the food you get. I think it's pretty great for a quick bite that isn't your usual cuisine."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place! It was a great fast-casual way to have Indian food and portions are hefty for the price. I had the rice bowl ($6.99) with tikka chicken and then added tikka sauce and a variety of toppings. It definitely hit the spot. My bf had the samosa dosa and that was just as tasty as well. We will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"Signature Grill is like Chipotle but for Indian-Mexican fusion. The portions are huge and well worth the price, especially if you load up on the vegetables. You have a choice of proteins, sauce (tikka or korma), and a whole bunch of toppings. I definitely recommend this place for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Indian fast food restaurants I tried. Definitely recommend the samosa wrap and paneer dosa. They really helped in explaining the menu too!"}
{"text":"This is a Chipotle style, build as you go place for Indian food. The flavor's pretty good here albeit lacking in spice, but it makes sense considering that its target demographic are college students of all types. I got a rice bowl with the malal chicken and tikka sauce. It's a little confusing to order since the menu's at the first station where you pick your type (bowl, dosa wrap, etc) and you don't see it as you go down. But you are led by the server asking you what you want and they're nice enough to explain what each of the items are. I was surprised about how many condiments they had. It looked like there was cilantro, cucumber, tomato, chickpeas, red onion, the three sauces, guac, sour cream, and cheese. The raw veggie with the cooked chicken and sauce is a little weird but not too bad. If you're looking for something cheap and more flavorful, go here."}
{"text":"Restaurant review Just as others mentioned, this is a Indian version of chipotle where you can chose between a rice bowel, burrito, salad, or tacos with different protein including tikka chicken, malai chicken, mint paneer, grilled beef, crunchy fish, and masala shrimp. For a first timer, the other options such as the tikka vs korma flavor are a bit confusing. You can choose from three sauces which are mild mint, medium tomato, and spicy red chili. Afterwards you finish off with different toppings such as cheese, quac, etc. I tried the chicken tikka burrito and I would say that the flavors were spot on (basically a chipotle burrito with indian spices). My wife chose the masala shrimp. This was a big let down as the food felt luke warm to cold and there was nothing special about this dish (basically curry shrimp over rice). We did not end up trying the partha or the samosas during our most recent visit. Food was served quick. Overall it was a good experience, but I think I would go to an Indian restaurant instead of this in the future  Pros: highly customizable, fast service, clean fast food restaurant  Cons: luke warm shrimp masala curry, slightly confusing sauces  Hidden deals: Hooked app for promotional offers. Thursday over summer you can get a free samosa with your meal.
