{"text":"Just went to this place because of the reviews. Ordered the soup noodle for takeout. Little did I know the tiny portion this soup noodle brings. There is  so  little noodles. The soup tastes extremely bland like water. There is no flavour and this is absolutely a waste of money. Never come back again!"}
{"text":"chicken entree is $12+. A bit much for just rice, salad, and chicken. Average food. Peanut sauce is not that great, tastes better when you add the chili sauce. wasn't bad, but not a place I would make my 1st, 2nd, or 3rd choice to eat. Pro: great customer service, clean environment."}
{"text":"Best indonesian foods you can get in the city. Cant wait til they add more items in their menu"}
{"text":"Went with a group of Indonesians, and we all loved this place. Authentic Indonesian food, and probably the best I have had outside of Southeast Asia. The peanut sauce for the satay was sweeter as is the case in Indonesia (vs. the Singaporean version), and the meat was tender. The sambal was a highlight; perfect blend of acidity, spice, and sweetness, and was very reminiscent of home. The keropok also brought back memories from childhood. All in all, superb and authentic Indonesian fare."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it was the best food decision we made all week! Definitely a must try if you're in the area. Everything we got was great, especially the shrimp crackers. They actually taste like shrimp and not the salty MSG laced ones from other places. I got another order just to share with my family. 

\"Share\""}
{"text":"Great place to try Indonesian food, great place to eat in general. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Coconut rice, chicken satay and fried chicken are highly recommended. Tempeh and tofu are great vegetarian options. Will go back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here two times and will continue to do so. I had the chicken satay and ayam goreng. Everything is so delicious and pretty filling (so you get what you paid for) 

P.S. Try substitute the rice with coconut rice! It's so yummy!"}
{"text":"Went here with a few people and we ordered fried chicken, rendang, chicken satay and beef satay. Other than the beef satay being a little bit hard, everything else was really tasty.

It's a bit pricier (spent around $12-13 per person), but the portion is pretty big and they gave us a lot of meat. The food came with rice, salad, and shrimp crackers too."}
{"text":"I read the reviews before ordering take-out here on a weeknight for dinner. I was expecting delicious food, however, maybe it was over-hyped, but I felt the food tastes only ok, but I have had better satay before. And for the price, we got the bigger portion of the satay, but it only came with two swekers of meat. I mean, they were not small skewers, but I guess we expected more. Maybe we are just comparing this to other Malaysian / Indonesian restaurants up in Markham. The beef rendang was ok, but again, but something we rave about, or somewhere we have to go again. But it is a nice addition to have in this location, as there aren't many Indonesian joints around."}
{"text":"I had a beef Rendang for lunch
Actually I think I expected too much
Becausr that food was mentioned the most delicious food in the world... but it didn't fit to me.. it's soso"}
{"text":"I had the Beef Rendang and was really impressed with my first try at Indonesian food! I really liked the spicy salad dressing they had."}
{"text":"So so good! Small menu and everything on it is awesome. Great staff. Best peanut sauce ever and definitely upgrade to coconut rice."}
{"text":"Very delicious! Nasi Goreng and the beef skewers are our fave.  We get takeout there frequently.  The hot sauce is really delicious. Be sure to ask for extra.  Everything is well priced and fairly quick.  Worth checking out if you are in the area.  Lots of paid parking nearby."}
{"text":"Drove by this Satay Sate many many times and finally decided to check it out. The place is pretty small, which I think could only sit around 15 people. 

Between my BF and I, we ordered nasi goreng and beef satay entree. Both meals came with salad and side of shrimp chips. The shrimp chips are made in house were delicious! They have a really strong shrimp paste after taste, which I'm a big fan of.  I wanted to upgrade my rice from the satay entree to coconut rice but they just ran out and the next batch wouldn't have been ready until 30 mins later.  

The food was pretty good, but I think the sauces were what made everything so tasty. They make their hot sauce in house and I asked if I was able to purchase it but they haven't decided to sell and bottle them yet  The peanut sauce with the Satay gave it delicious flavour. The meat was a little bit dry but the sauce definitely helped. 

Overall pretty decent food. I'd give it 3.5 stars. Would like to try the coconut rice next time!"}
{"text":"This place is very trendy and clean looking. Food is excellent and great price. If you are in the area, you have to try it out."}
{"text":"We love the food here! 

We tried the beef entree and chicken wrap and both were amazing. The salad and meat were very tasty and the servings were decent. Reasonably priced for the quality and size. 

Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick snack or a wonderful dinner! Peanut sauce that's really rich and flavourful! The beef rendang is superb!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Had their Ayam Goreng and Satay (all from the beef to chicken to tofu ones) and they were allll amazing. Ayam Goreng was perfectly seasoned, crispy yet soft in the inside and I loved the peanut sauce on the satay. Eating there made me feel like I was back in Indo for a second and I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"A group of us shared 4 different dishes for lunch... Beef rendang (a bit dry), Chicken Satay (underwhelming), Tempeh Satay (tasted horrible, and I usually like stinky bean curd), Ayam Goreng (Fried chicken with crispy coating was ok) with some shrimp chips (oil wasn't fresh).  Overall a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable price considering great quality. Beef rendang is so flavourful and very authentic"}
{"text":"A great place to grab Indonesian eats!
The owner is from Indonesia and is proud of the dishes here.

I had the beef satay entree with coconut rice, salad, and shrimp chips.

The skewers were delicious with rich peanut sauce.

I'll have to come back for the Rendang curry, fried rice, and fried chicken!

The menu is small but the items were super tasty!  Especially the peanut sauce! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I was craving some authentic asian flavours and this hits the spot.

Will come again very soon!"}
{"text":"Recommend that you skip anything with beef - it's tough, dry, and slightly gamey.  Would suggest going for chicken instead, which we had through an order of Ayam Goreng. It's too bad, really, because the Beef Rendang was pretty tasty curry minus the actual beef.  Also really enjoyed the side of hot chilli sauce which comes speckled with tiny dried shrimps.
Have ordered the satay in the past, but found them again to be on the dry side and small amounts of meat on our skewers.  Not quite SATAYsfied. *ba dum tssssssss*"}
{"text":"Colleagues and I got lunch from this place and totally loved it. We tried majority of the stuff from the menu and everyone was really happy.  For the price and deliciousness... we would order everything again.Top Recommendations: Rendang, Ayam Goreng, Beef Sate & Chicken Sate."}
{"text":"This is a great find in midtown Toronto. Really delicious Indonesian food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch with a couple of other foodies. We shared several orders to taste a bit of everything. Overall, the food was really good and the service is fast. We had the following:

Beef Rendang is slow braised curried beef in coconut milk and spices. This was my favourite dishes with large, tender pieces of beef and braised in curry. The curry itself is no hot so its perfect for those who can take a bit but not too much. 

Ayam Goreng is deep fried marinated chicken. This was a really good dish where the chicken is fried crispy with a hint of spices or curry. Overall a great alternative to those other fast food places. 

We also had the spring rolls which was a bit bland but is okay. 

Summary, come here for a visit, it is worth it. It is close to the subway station along Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Yummy and cozy. This restaurant limits itself to producing a few dishes well, and at reasonable prices. I will pop by for more rendang next time I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Wow! Best indonian/Malaysian food ever! You know you've hit a gem when the restaurant is witty enough to open on yonge and North York center area only serving a handful of items.

Their coconut rice and shrimp crackers are out of this world! Do yourself a favour and give them a try. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place as there aren't too many Indonesian joints near where I live. 

We ordered the Nasi Goreng and Beef Rendang.

I'm sorry to say that I'm pretty disappointed; moreso for the latter entree. 

1. Nasi Goreng

Texture: The rice tasted very dry during the first couple of bites - kind of like the dried out scorched rice at the bottom of a baked chinese casserole. I initially wondered if the rest of the dish would taste that way..but thankfully, the rice underneath the egg and chicken was a lot more moist

Flavor: Nothing special. Just seemed like rice and soy sauce. I dumped about 5 cups of their hot sauce (which was more of a sweet sauce vs hot), and that upped the flavor profile a bit... The salad on the side of the fried rice was refreshing though, and the portions were generous; I thought it gave the dish a nice balance. Flavorwise, this wasn't an earth-shattering fried rice, but it was satisfying. 

2. Beef Rendang

Texture: I switched it up with the coconut rice on this one, which like the rice in the nasi goreng, was unremarkable. 

The meat texture was too firm..the chunks were pretty big, which would have worked if the meat was tender.. but instead, i ended up looking like a masticating cow trying to break down well, that cow. 

Flavor: Mild curry flavor with a sour note. Having never had much of Indonesian style curry, it just didn't seem as captivating as Thai, Japanese or HK style curries that I've had. Maybe because it was lukewarm when I dug in."}
{"text":"I remember this spot used to be the old Dairy Queen location. Now it is a great Satay place to eat in or takeout. I did not wait that long for my food.

I came here by a recommendation by my sister who tried this place beforehand. I ordered the chicken satay meal. It came with satay chicken, rice, salad and cracker chips too. For $13 after tax, it is such a great deal as I was so full afterwards. The chicken satay was amazing and the sauce really was the real MVP here. Very good sauce and chicken was moist. The sauce also goes so well with the rice. The salad had red onions, tomatoes and cucumbers and it was fresh in general. 

Great meal if you are looking for something healthy around the North York Centre area."}
{"text":"If you are craving for some good satay and you are around Yonge and Sheppard area, make sure you stop by and check this place out.

This restaurant is like a grab and go take out place.

The food here is very flavourful and authentic.
We ordered the beef rendang & the chicken satay.
The beef and chicken were moist and the satay sauce tasted so good with rice !!! I would recommend to get the coconut rice instead of the regular rice- totally worth it!

The service of this restaurant was excellent, staff were very friendly. We came here on a Sunday night just about 20 mins before closing- the staff here didn't rush us and told us to take our time to eat. 

This is a restaurant that i will revisit for sure when I crave for some satays."}
{"text":"Indonesian food is tough to find in North York. Excellent food. You need to try the wraps for a lunch on the go, But the fried chicken is the best."}
{"text":"My family and I ordered the beef, chicken satay, ayam gand the beef rendang with coconut rice. It was very filling and delicious. The atmosphere and design of the restaurant is very nice and modern. We also had excellent service. A great place to eat with friends and family!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I ordered the Ayam Goreng and my boyfriend got the Beef Rendang. Good sized portions! One of my three chicken pieces (the biggest of 3) was borderline raw and the owner (?) Immediately offered to remake the entire entree. I declined as I was already so full! Great customer service. I will definitely return and tell my friends to eat here. My bf went through three of their hot sauces... couldn't get enough!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday. At first I thought their menu was quite limited. But they are really good at what they do! The location used to be a Dairy Queen. It is a take out setting with around 10 seats. There's a patio which will be open in summer. The interior is a casual and clean. The pop of green makes it a little chic. 

We ordered the beef sate entree, chicken sate warp and a tempeh skewer. The beef sate entree was flavourful but it can be a little more tender. The tempeh is a traditional Indonesian fermented soybean cake with satay sauce. For people who are not familiar with Asian fermented food, the first bite might be a little funny due to the unique smell and a little sourness. As I take a few more bites and dip it into the nutty satay sauce comes with it. I actually like it very much! I would recommend this to anyone who likes soy bean dishes. The chicken warp is very good too as the chicken is very tender and the satay sauce compliment it's flavour very well.

Overall we are happy with the food. The seatings might is a little limited so it's more suitable for take out. The menu is small but quality is great. It's like a street food vendor with outstanding food kinda experience. I will come back when their patio is open or get takeouts."}
{"text":"I got the Amaya gorgen, fried chicken didn't feel too heavy .. chicken size is a bit on the small side.  Not what we North Americans are used to.. will come back... service was good ... spice level was not too bad it could have used a little more kick... lady behind the counter was nice, she offered me a glass of water .. I would have to rate this place as bit pricey... I would have preferred the meal would have costed $10 instead of $13... I like the decor"}
{"text":"Saw review on yelp so went to buy take out to give it a try. Bought 2 dinner meal to try out. The Ayam Goreng meal and Beef Rendang meal.

First of all the most basic thing rice they can't even make it the right way cause is really hard and hard to chew maybe been left there for a while that's why is hard. 

Salad was simple lettuce carrots not enough dressing for the salad so not much taste. 

Ayam Goreng was ok can put in more flavor and less dry would be better. For $13 a meal tax included  is pricy for the 3 small pieces of fried chicken. 

Rendang Beef a little too much on the coconut milk that covers all the Rendang flavor. Is a little dry too cause they put in a heat box. So the gravy will get less and less. 

For this price there is more choices to choose in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on a work day when I was having cravings for south east asian food. The restaurant was only steps away from North York Centre and although a small joint, tables were wide apart to provide you enough space to walk through and not feel crammed.

There were a few good items on the menu, but mind you it was -18 degrees outside and I was down for some spicy food. I ordered the Beef Rendang (a braised beef curry dish) and my friend had Ayam Goreng Meal (fried chicken drumsticks). Both came with rice and salad, as well as hot sauce, which was a pretty complete meal set.

The braised beef was tender and easy to break with just a fork. The breading of the chicken was crispy and crunchy, the flavouring was just right without being too greesy or salty. We pretty much inhaled the food. Water was readily available at the counter for self-serve, so you don't need to wait to refill during you meal.

This joint did not disappoint and I would highly recommend either dish depending on your cravings. Also, I would suggest substituting regular rice with coconut rice as it is only $1, and the aroma from coconut rice adds a kick to your dining experience."}
{"text":"Fried chicken was delicious, it was well marinated and the spices really went through. It was very juicy, tender and the crispy crumbs was the b.o.m.b! The chilli was perfect compliment to this dish, very fragrant and added a definite kick. The chicken satay was well done, topped with peanut sauce and drizzled with sweet soy sauce. The rendang was a different kind from what we grew up with but this kind is probably friendlier to Canadian taste buds; the meat was very tender and fragrant, the sauce rounded it up well. The complimentary shrimp crackers were amazing and the acar/pickled veggies and salad was very refreshing. 

Although the menu is limited, each was prepared well and they took the time to prepare it (some were cooked/marinated for days). 
Portion was huge, we were both very satisfied. The service was very friendly. The lady owner cared to interact with all the customers. We will definitely come back. It's honestly the best Indonesian restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"This is the spot if you want to grab a bite of delicious Indonesian food. The food is tasty and the service is good. I had both of the dinner plates and I would suggest the fried chicken with coconut rice. Although the seating is a bit cramped and the serving size on the smaller side, you should definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is very simple, low quality fast food.
Actually it's not a restaurant just small kiosk."}
{"text":"Had the sate beef entree and rendang for the first time, it was very delicious! good quality of beef. You can tell that the rendang beef was marinated for a long time as it is very soft and savoury.  Love the coconut rice and the acar sides. 
Second time, had the sate beef wrap. It is a very good size and a quick easy bite you can get when you are in a rush! 
Love this place and will come back again to try their ayam goreng! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This little spot is wonderful. The food was nicely presented, good quality, great price and very delicious! Those pickled cucumbers with anything....yum! Definitely going back :)"}
{"text":"Never really had much Indonesian food in my life before. But coming here has now really made me wish there were more Indonesian restaurants. My personal favourite was the beef Satay as it was more flavourful to it. The restaurant itself isn't too big so don't expect yourself to find a table there during busy hours. The service was great and the price was average."}
{"text":"We tried out this place last night as a quick option for dinner. Took over the location where Dairy Queen used to be at Yonge and Elmwood

The renos and decor is modern and clean. Set up is mainly for takeout and quick eats at tall bar tables. About seating for 15 - 20 total capacity. Staff is very friendly and from Indonesia. 

We ordered Nasi Goreng, spring rolls, beef and chicken says and an extra side of shrimp chips. I must say the owner is very friendly and let us know not to order too much as we may be over-ordering. Really appreciate when they are more concerned with your meal instead of upselling!

Now onto the food. Nasi Goreng is authentic, similar to our travels in Jakarta and Bali. Only this is the rice was slightly overcooked (mushier than normal) but still tasted good. The satays were both excellent and drenched in peanut sauce, just they way they should be! Spring rolls are very different than Chinese, Vietnamese, or Thai spring rolls. They have tofu inside and the consistency is soft on inside, crispy on the outside. I enjoyed them. Finally, they serve REAL authentic shrimp chips, not the multi colored variety. Yum, those are the best and didn't disappoint. Order an extra side of peanut sauce for the shrimp chips!

All in all, excellent service, great food, will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the ayam goreng and sate, which were good. Service is friendly. Deducted some points because the portions were small for that price point. Will likely visit again."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with husband last Saturday. Ayam goreng is very crispy and sate is also great. Overall it's a nice place with authentic food and good service."}
{"text":"Pretty good and owner was very nice. Got the chicken sate with coconut rice. Personally I felt the price was a bit steep, but the taste and quality were quite good. I really enjoyed the shrimp chips it came with, the shrimp taste is strong and I think they make it in house. It's not really a dine in place as there aren't many seats, but it's good for takeout!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place but was deterred by the fact that it's a total pain to eat in (small place, 100% barstools). But the opportunity came up, and I got to try the beef rendang, ayam goreng, and coconut rice.

The beef was beef stew with a different flavour profile, an Indonesian spin on one of my favourite foods - slightly spicy, very hearty, and luscious with coconut milk(?). Rice is required to sop up all the sauce.

The chicken was honestly flawless. Perfectly crispy and moist with a nice texture, and reasonably filling. I mean, fried chicken is usually going to be good, and this did not disappoint.

The coconut rice was quickly stolen by my dining companion, but my two forkfuls were fluffy and slightly sweet. The pickles were a great accent with a nice amount of kick. Even the salad was pretty good! A very solid option in the area."}
{"text":"I came here on a recommendation from a friend. I ordered the chicken satay entree and it came with two large chicken satay skewers, steamed rice, and a salad. The chicken was very tender and juicy and it went very well with the rich and tasty peanut sauce. The salad was also tasted very refreshing between the rich flavors. 

I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Reminds me of my mother's cooking.
Not a 100% represent Indonesian food, since they have to adapt with Canadian market too. It more resemble when Indonesian tried to cook those food at home, so it's delicious and tasty. If you ever went to Indonesia or you're an Indonesian, I think this is one place that you have to visit. I'd love the combination of their beed rendang + nasi uduk + kremes (ask them to add it for you) + kerupuk (or cracker)."}
{"text":"Good;  Clean, Delicious, Service, Friendliness  
However, there are not enough selections on the menu, perhaps because the place is fairly new. Hope to see more on the menu shortly such as NASI GORENG, MI GORENG, etc.

Bad;  nothing really"}
{"text":"Ordered beef and chicken, and tempe side. Chicken was good, beef was hard as a rock. Everything was cut very thickly, feels more like a souvlaki than a Satay. The tempe was well done on the outside but still raw in the inside. The hot sauce and the satay sauce was delicious. 

Feedback: cut the meat and the tempe thinly and give more skewers just like how we do it back in Indonesia right?; it's called Satay Sate after all. Also should totally include lamb Satay since it's the most popular type of meat to be skewered as a satay."}
{"text":"My friend who is from Malaysia heard about this new place and suggested we go try. I said  sure let's go.  

I expected this to be a restaurant but turns out this is a more of a takeout place with high chairs and a few tables with one major table for 6 people smacked in the middle of the restaurant. There are also two tables for two on the right hand side which is facing the washroom and a few wall seats on the left side.. so about 18 to 20 seats..  

The Beef Rendang was very authentic according to my Malaysian friend. It was indeed delicious. I love the chunk of meat for the beef   The portion size is decent for lunch.   I wish the food and rice could have been hotter though. The beef randang entree comes with a side of salad, and a tiny container of hot sauce.  It all comes in a takeout box.

We also had the chicken satay skewers which was saucy with peanut sauce. Again the entree came with salad, rice and a tiny container of spicy sauce. I like the skewers but my friend felt it lacked some spunk. 

There is street parking and paid parking behind the restaurant.  $5 for all day parking Sunday. 

Service wised, it was kk. There isn't always someone at the counter so u may need to walk to the kitchen side to get their attention. Or they may need to set some kind of bell whistle to alert them that a customer is waiting to order. 

Expect about 8-10 mins for your food after you ordered. 

For a takeout place, the main entree dishes seemed kind of pricey at $11.49 + taxes. Two main entrees ended up being $26 for two people. With a drink, it was $30.   Yikes.

This place also sells wraps if u don't like rice.

Closed at 9pm so no possibility of a late nite snack or food."}
{"text":"The tofu satay is the best. Love it for a quick place to grab dinner. The staff is really friendly and the place is clean and tidy."}
{"text":"3.7/5

Good home style meal.
I been to this place 7+ times and tried basically every items in the menu. Few items taste little bland but their fried chicken meal is absolutely delicious. 

My only complain is their price tag is little steep for the what you actually get. You get small cheap homemade style meal with the price tag of nice takeout. I don't normally complain about the price tag if it's quality food is on point, but brutally tiny pieces of meat and small portion of main dish that will notgoing to satisfy your hunger, doesn't seems right to me. If they lower the price to below $10 or change the portion size, they got themselves a loyal customer."}
{"text":"A great little place with yummy food. We had tried Ayam Goreng (deep fried chicken with rice and house salad), and chicken Sate (traditional Indonesian skewers) which came with steamed rice and house salad. I asked my rice to be replaced with coconut rice by paying a little extra. All food tasted great, specially the coconut rice was delicious. Chicken skewers were tender and juicy. The servers were very friendly. The lady in charge of the kitchen came out to check how everything was going on and chatted for a while with the customers which was great. Food quantity was plenty enough to fill you up. I will definitely return for a quick bite."}
{"text":"A good combination of carbs, veggies and meat. Flavour and textures are on point and not to mention, I'm obsessed with their peanut sauce! It's a simple menu but they do it well. I'm surprised that they're never busy when I'm there."}
{"text":"The food is good but they are spicy.  I had their beef wrap and it was very big but very tasty.  It had white rice, beef satay pieces, and vegetables inside.  Great location with parking in the back.  Very limited menu but they just opened so the nice lady said she will be adding more on the menu in the future.  
My husband had the curried beef. He said it was good but some of the beef pieces were hard and it needed more sauce.
Their shrimp crackers are the best.  So good!"}
{"text":"This was the third of seven stops on our food crawl so this review is limited to just the beef and chicken satay skewers.

Both meats were tender but, while the flavour wasn't bad, it seemed to be lacking something. Maybe a little more seasoning, even just salt? A little more smoky flavour from the grill would have been really good. The peanut sauce, abundantly smothered over the skewers, was also a bit bland. Adding some hot sauce helped.

Maybe I just like lots of seasoning on my food but at almost $4.00 per skewer, it's not a great deal. I really wanted to like this place but there's room for improvement."}
{"text":"As someone who was born in Indonesia, this place reminds me of home. It could be a little spicier but it understandably needs to be milder for Canadian consumption. I've going back few times and will do for more in the future."}
{"text":"I would give this a 3.5 but I'll round it to 4 stars. The satay sauce is great but I found the meat to be a bit on the dry side. There was a lot of sauce, which feels very heavy for the meal. The meal costs $12 so it does feel a bit pricy for just two skewers and sides. However this is a great location to walk to and it's a great place for take out!"}
{"text":"Great decor, but disappointing food for a $10+ lunch box.

DECOR
Really cute, modern minimal decor with bar stools for seating, and also an outdoors dining area for the summer. The graphics and furnishings are impeccable for a small hole-in-the way shop. Can't argue with that.

FOOD
I ordered the beef sate. Chewy beef (really chewy) on 2 skewers, covered in a yummy state sauce, with a small hemisphere of rice, a salad, and some really crispy/dense prawn chips. The food wasn't bad, per say, but definitely not worth the price tag. And I was a bit disappointed after the hype. The prawn chips were my favorite part.

Not sure if I'm coming back. This place was definitely more hype/novelty than groundbreaking flavours. And I'm still a bit miffed by the chewy beef. Nothing outstanding, all in all. They either need to lower the price, or up the ante on the food."}
{"text":"Happened to be passing through the area and had always wanted to try this place. Upon entering its a clean and simple no frills space. The menu is short and sweet, which is fine as I rather an establishment do a few things great then everything ok.

My other half got the nasi gorang with a chicken skewer on the side and I got the fried chicken with coconut rice and a beef skewer.

It came out relatively quickly, decently priced with a decent portion size. The entire thing came out to about $30 and change. 

The skewers were nice and juicy though for some reason were really tough to pull off. The chicken also came with a large sprinkling of deep fried batter on top that didn't add much to the dish except take up space. It was tasty, but I wasn't blown away.

This place is definitely worth a try, and I would come back again. Though if your expecting to be wowed, there wasn't anything that really jumped out at me. It's pretty good, but lacked a dash of wow factor."}
{"text":"Ok, folks.  Let's get one thing straight.  Just because someone is from a certain country, that does not always mean they cook their cuisine well.  I read from countless reviews that the owners are from Indonesia so the food is authentic and good.  Come again?  I'm Korean and I've been to countless disappointing Korean restaurants in and around Toronto that are run by Koreans but still serve terrible Korean food.  It's like saying everyone from Montreal must cook awesome smoked meat sandwiches and make delicious poutine.  But I digress.

I was sadly disappointed with SS when I picked up some take out to share with my husband's family (part Indonesian, born and raised in Indonesia).  Nasi Goreng was dry and sub-par to what my mother-in-law has cooked for us at home, the beef & chicken satay were dry and the accompanying peanut sauce was too sweet.  Soto ayam was filled with shredded chicken breast (also dry) and barely had any broth.  What~~!? 
The noodle dish (I forget the name) was also dry and the pieces of meat in it were also dry.  DRY, DRY, DRY, DRY, DRY!  That was the name of the game here.  It's almost as if all the food were pre-cooked and re-heated/re-cooked.  

I doubt that I'd be back to try their limited menu again."}
{"text":"Ordered:
Beef Rendang, $11.50
Plus $1 for coconut upgrade.
Ayam Goreng, $11.50.

Both came with shrimp chips that tasted like \"stinky tofu\", garbagey-taste.  
Not recommended.

Both came with salad & acar sauce; they were ok.

Quite expensive, for sure, it reflects the rent.
Value wise, the $11.50 price would have been ok if it came with a drink.

Both combo were ok-tasting.

Parking was $1."}
{"text":"It's always a treat when I can get Indonesian food and see that the resturant stays true to its authentic flavors. I came during lunch hour and the place was slightly packed with buisness folks, so I waited a little but was given complementary shrimp crackers due to the long wait. I got the chicken satay wrap and was happy with the burst of flavors that were packed into it! The tenderness of the marinated satay, the yummy coconut rice, the spicy and tangy achar, and the delicious peanut sauce made for a delicious lunch where I enjoyed each bite! It was a bit spicy for my tongue, but thankfully I cooled down with a teh botol (Indonesia's version of Nestea!)"}
{"text":"I got take out here a few times. Mostly the chicken sate plate. It comes with rice topped with garlic chips, two chicken sate skewers, and salad for $11. It's very filling and the skewers are yummy and not dry. I like the peanut sauce they are coated in. The salad had a nice dressing too."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. Had the curried beef rendang. As well as the beef skewer. 
Definitely recommend both.
Next time I'll probably try the other skewers and the wraps.  Highly recommend. 
Seating area is small so if you are coming with a big group not ideal."}
{"text":"Pros:
Food is very well done
Service is excellent

Cons:
Might not be filling enough for big eaters

Satay Sate is located literally steps from my place.  Before Satay Sate, there were about 3 different restaurants in the same location that flamed out pretty quickly.  Based on my experience here, I'm hopeful Satay Sate is here to stay!!

The location is pretty small, but there's enough space if you want to stay in and eat.  For the most part though, you will be taking out.  Looking at their menu, it's fairly simplistic.  They do 6 entrees and have some sides to pick from as well.  When you have only 6 items, you better do them well.  Satay Sate definitely do what they do well indeed. 

We ordered the Beef Satay entree and the Ayam Goreng (Fried Chicken) entree.  The entrees come with a salad and rice.  I would of preferred some grilled veggies but that's no biggie.  The beef satay was pretty well done.  It wasn't melt in your mouth tender, but tender enough you really wouldn't need a knife. The sauce was it comes with excellent, with just enough spice to it.  The fried chicken was also good.  It comes with a drumstick and a thigh.  I would of preferred one more piece, but that's the big eater in me talking.  The chicken was very crispy and not too greasy. 

The service here was excellent.  Everyone was super friendly.  The lady at the counter was super nice.  She explained everything they had really well and was very patient.  I had my little one with me and while we were waiting for our food, she interacted with out little one very well.  She even made a paper boat out of the menu for her.  My little one then asked for a place and she proceeded to try and make that as well.  It wasn't needed, but was very nice and pleasant.  The Chefs in the back even come out to chat with customers once in a while too.

I'm a fan of this place.  I've seen many business in this location come and go just as quickly, I'm hoping Satay Sate is a permanent fixture here.  The meals may leave big eaters wanting more, but it's still a very good place to check out."}
{"text":"Excellent food excellent service. We got the tofu sate meal and beef rendang. Absolutely loved the tofu sate! A little over priced, but the deliciousness makes up for it :) 

I can't wait to come back to try different dishes!"}
{"text":"I love the beef rendang here especially with the coconut rice ($1 add on) because it's so creamy and flavourful. Also the side salad is refreshing and the side dish chips are delicious, although to some the flavour might be a little strong (my mother doesn't like them a ton), they're super crispy and remind me of a tortilla chip

Price wise, I find their food reasonable for the portion amount that they give

Seating wise the area isn't very large so if you have more than a group of 3 it might be better to get takeout instead."}
{"text":"Who would of Thunk it! In the middle of willowdale, little North on yonge from Sheppard Station you would arrive at Indonesia...their name says it all..extremely authentic cuisine from that part of the world I ordered the Indonesian fried chicken at $12.25 worth every penny comes with rice but I substituted mine for coconut rice and salad. I also added extra hot sauce on the side. It was Devine, delicious, and damn diggidy good!

Gonna be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Despite having a very diverse and thriving food scene, Indonesian restaurants are a very rare breed in Toronto. So I was extremely excited when I found out about Satay Sate, which brands itself as an Indonesian street food restaurant. Best of all, it is in my neighborhood of North York, just a very short walk away from North York TTC Station.

The restaurant itself is very small and geared towards fast food style / take-out format, so the food you get will only come in take-out boxes. There are tables available if you want to dine there, and the seating capacity is enough to accomodate 13-15 diners.

For our visit, we ordered:

Beef Rendang (Slow Braised curried beef in coconut milk and spices Indonesian Style): We found the beef and the sauce very tasty, although the beef could be a bit more tender. Unlike other restaurants which douse heavy doses of coconut milk into their sauce, the sauce here at Satay Sate only has a subtle coconut flavor and it's a welcomed change. Great dish overall for $11.49.

Ayam Goreng Meal (Deep fried marinated chicken along with crispy tasty crumbs): The chicken had a nice crispy crust there was not overly thick, and it was tender and moist. We upgraded to the coconut rice which was great upgrade as it is very delicious, and should have done the same for the Rendang dish. The coconut rice is not what you expect, as it is actually coconut-lime rice, and the lime flavour comes thru much more so than the subtle coconut. There are also crispy bits with this dish that was made from rice flour and the sauce leftover from after the chicken is marinated, and this was great with the coconut rice. Yum! Great value at $11.49, and the $1 coconut rice upgrade was well worth it.

Both dishes came with shrimp crackers (even though there is no indication of this on the menu), which are very dense compared to the ones you normally get at supermarket / Chinese restaurants. We both loved the crackers, but probably would not have gotten then normally for $2.50 standalone price.

We also ordered a chicken skewer, and it came with a blend of peanut and a sweet molasses-like sauce. Even though the skewer was tender and delicious, we can't help but think it is somewhat pricey at $3.79. I think it would be much more palatable if it was $9 for 3 skewers or something.

Overall, I think Satay Sate is a very welcomed addition to the very under-served Indonesian food scene here in Toronto, and I would come back again."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when I walked in to grab a bite. It's a casual unassuming diner with high bar stool style seating. Clean quaint and modern. I had their nasigoran and their fried chicken dish. Best fried chicken I've had. I wish I can order just the chicken alone with no rice or naan"}
{"text":"Had a great first experience here! 

This place has a small menu but what they do, they do quite well! The restaurant is cute and modern but mostly a takeout place and the service was charming and kind!

The food was really delicious. Having traveled extensively through south east Asia and having eaten a lot of satay, I can say that these are pretty good. The sticks themselves are decent, the peanut sauce and acar are delicious, similar to what I've  had in restaurants Indonesia and Malaysia. 

In Asia the skewers come a lot smaller and their flavour is much more concentrated, you can eat just the skewer on its own and it would be delicious. I feel like these skewers were a bit bland on their own and really needed that delicious peanut sauce and hot sauce to complete them. Also they're more like a shish kebab than your traditional satay skewer in portion size, giving two per entree and sold individually for around $3 and some change. The coconut rice is really delicious, this is a $1 add-on and I really recommend this! We also tried the newly added menu item lumpia which are basically spring rolls with a tofu filling, they were good but wouldn't repeat them. Lastly we had the ayam goreng which is their Indonesian style fried chicken, this was delicious, the chicken was well marinated and crispy, we would get this one again for sure. Another tip is to get yourself an extra container of peanut sauce, we were dipping everything in that stuff, putting it on our rice, on the fried chicken, lumpia, etc... the drizzle they give with the skewers isn't enough in my opinion! Get the extra peanut sauce, again this is a $1 add-on but it's a nicely sized container and it's well worth it. 

The gentleman that served us was enthusiastic and very nice. We ordered takeout so it was a quick interaction but a positive one. 

The restaurant is lovely, it is a takeout joint with limited seating and no wait service. It's modern and clean and I love that the menu is small and focused. 

This is a unique place and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to try something new, the flavours are pretty authentic and the prices are very decent, all meals being around $11 and they come with rice, salad and shrimp chips. 

I would definitely come back to try the beef curry and have more satay!"}
{"text":"I have a high expectation of this place since I love Satay. 

I ordered side dish size Satay skewers - chicken and beef. 

Good -
The skewers are freshly cooked and it was served in hot. 

Meat is very tender and juice 

Bad -
The meat is pretty burnt. 

The Satay has lot of peanut but lack of Satay flavours. The consistency is bit too watery. I am not sure if it is the Indonesian style. 

It is on pricy side $3.79 per skewer."}
{"text":"The service was great - the staff was super friendly and welcoming.... but the food not so much. I ordered the chicken wrap and 3 skewers (1 chicken, 1 beef, 1 tempeh).

I shouldn't have ordered the wrap because the type of rice they used didn't match well with the wrap itself. I'm guessing/hoping it would've tasted better if I ordered it in the entree form (it's the same thing but the rice, meat, and salad are eaten separately rather than filled into a wrap - not sure why there's a $2 difference). 

The skewers were also mediocre. Not worth $4/skewer. Maybe my expectations were set too high :( I'm glad I got to try what tempeh tastes like though!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy I got satay in my tummy. Great sauces not dry. Rendang beef is soft and the portion are good."}
{"text":"What the cluck. Maybe I had too high expectations, but the ayam goreng (fried chicken) meal was just plain boring. The chicken itself was decent - not dry and crunchy like fried chicken should be. I also liked how they included all the crunchy fried batter bits that made its way into the crevices of the salad. The rice was rice although the fried garlic on top made it a bit more interesting. I guess I was looking for this to be more \"Indonesian\", perhaps spicier or saucier, but eating this was almost borderline eating at a Popeyes. Nothing really different here. May come back one day to try other dishes, but for now, this dude is chickening out. Aha. Pro tip: take your food to go and eat it outside in Mel Lastman Square.  By the way, this place is just steps from North York Centre subway station.

{"text":"Ate here on recommendation of a co-worker. I have to say I am impressed, when i told the lady I can't handle spicy foods, she gave me a sample to ensure I was okay with it, that's good service!! I had the nasi gorang $8.49 the indo fried rice with chicken, rice cracker and salad, all tasted amazing! I will definitely come back and try the other items!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and the simplicity of their menu. I ordered the Beef Entreé and my friend ordered the Beef Rendeng.

The Beef Entreé comes with 2 beef skewers, rice, salad and shrimp chips and costs around $12 bucks. The salad tastes a bit pickled which I love since I have my palette favours sweet and sour flavours. The beef skewers are pretty much flavourless without the sauce; the sauce definitely makes the beef tasty. The sauce is on the sweet-savoury side. They also give you a spicy sauce in a small container which yu can dip the beef with or spread it all over your rice. The sauce is really spicy! A tad bit leaves an explosion of heat in your mouth so you are warned! The beef's grilled well; comparable to a well-done piece of steak. As for the shrimp chips, they are tasty and taste fresh.

The Beef Rendeng that my friend ordered comes with rice and salad as well however, with braised beef in curry. The beef is very tender and just falls apart in your mouth. The curry lacked that \"curry\" favour and very heavy in coconut flavour. It tasted as if you were eating a creamy coconut sauce. 

Service is pretty quick and prompt. Price is decent for portion (unless you're a big eater..). Food is okay."}
{"text":"Not that I'm an expert on Indonesian food, but my family is chinese-indonesian and these foods were familiar to me, and it was great to see some Indonesian food here. 
SOTO AYAM soup- My favourite thing I tried. but would love it if they could give more lime pieces on the side, and perhaps some bean spouts. 
Coconut rice- was delicious
shrimp chips- were real - but would be even better if fried fresher. 
sauce condiments were delicious. 
The meat satays (I had beef, chicken, and tofu and tempeh)- The meet is alot bigger, chunkier, and juicier with less of a marinade, than what I was used to at family functions and easier to pull off than the ones im used to-- where the meat is much smaller and I remember it having more of a marinade. So i'm not sure if the satays, with their big chunky, juicy, steak-like shish-kabob-like look are catered to the expectations of the demographic here? Nonetheless, the peanut sauce was yummy and I was impressed that the meat was of good quality and tenderness. 
Tofu satay- was good but deep fried and a bit oily - For a healthier option, i wonder if a firm grilled tofu would be equally good? 
TEMPEH satay- This was my favourite satay. Tempeh isn't for everyone, but for those who know it, this tempeh satay was delicious!!! It was not dry and was moist -- though if you're vegan/vegetarian you may want to double-check if the peanut sauce contains fish products. 
Deep fried plantain with chocolate sprinkles and condensed milk and cheese- Chocolate sprinkles were of excellent quality -- using the dutch kind (made of real cocoa), I would have liked to see this done with a banana just for my taste, or a sweeter plantain.  
Next thing Id love to see on the menu is GADO GADO salad, and some more non-fried veggie options! and what about CENDOL for dessert in the hot summer heat? Can you add it to the menu??? =) 
Finally- one thing I appreciated from this place was that although they are take-out restaurant -- they at least made the effort to choose a 90 day compostable packaging for their take out gear --- To take an extra step towards more environmental consciousness -- what about allowing customers to bring their own tupperware ? or providing some eat-in silverware and washable plates/bowls for the few tables that you do have in your establishment??"}
{"text":"Food was alright. Beef Randung lacked the curry aspect.

The skewers were good.

The fried chicken was a 7/10. Good but lacked flavour"}
{"text":"We ordered the nasi goreng, and the beef satay.  Unfortunately this took a long time too because the cashier was new.  She didn't know how to put in the order.....ughh......

Back to the more important topic, the actual food.  Our food arrived relatively quickly.   And it smelled so good!  My nasi goreng was like a garlic fried rice, topped with a fried egg, pieces of chicken and a cucumber salad.  It was delicious.  The rice was fried well, with lots of garlic flavour.  I just wish the chicken was mixed into the fried rice.  My other complaint would be the the rice got increasingly spicy as I ate it.  It would have been nice if there was a warning about the level of spiciness, or if there was the possibility of customizing how spicy the dish would be. 

The beef satay, there were 2 skewers drizzled with a peanut sauce, served with a side salad and some coconut rice.  We've never had coconut rice before, but the hubby loved it.  He asked if we could try and make coconut rice at home.  Now I just need to find a recipe.  The beef satay was just ok.  The beef was tender, but almost like it was tenderized with something.  The downside of the beef was that it was pretty stuck onto the bamboo skewer.  We tried taking it off with a fork but it was so stuck we couldn't, so we had to pull off pieces with our teeth.  It was almost dangerous to eat!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, very clean place, food was very tasty. Vegan/vegetarian friendly items. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I could hear Danica C's voice saying \"I told you so! Why you did not read my review?!\"

Chicken and Beef Satay for $4 each is a little on the pricey side for what I was getting. The meat was tender but lack the flavour (needs more seasoning) and that fresh of the grill aroma. The peanut sauce which is usually the star of satay was weak too. 

I ended up asking for some hot sauce. The hot made hot sauce is tasty and have a good kick. Maybe hot sauce really made everything better?"}
{"text":"Satay Sate is the place for Indonesian Street Food. It brings the island culture to Toronto! 

I ordered the tofu sate entree for $10.49 with +$1 for coconut rice. I adore their creamy flavourful coconut rice.  Fried tofu Satay with lusious house made peanut sauce and spicy hot sauce is a match made in heaven. Our meal was served with house salads and shrimp chips. 

Be sure to get hot sauce at the side! It really makes a difference!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my friend and I really enjoyed the food.  I had the tofu satay skewer and their peanut sauce is the bomb and the hot sauce they had too was really good.  I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"We ordered the beef rangdang meal and upgraded to coconut rice.  It was delicious and the beef was very easy to eat and full of flavor from the generous amount of sauce.  The salad was refreshing since it had a light dressing to balance the satay sauce on the beef.  Order doesn't take long, maybe 5 mins or shorter depending on queue etc."}
{"text":"Great food! We got the beef satay plate and the ayam goreng. 

The beef was perfect, cooked medium and had the stickiest and thickest satay sauce I've had. It was so tender and juicy! Definitely upgrade to the coconut rice, you get bits of kafir lime which is super tasty. 

The ayam roreng (fried chicken) was good also. Nothing spectacular, the city already has amazing fried chicken but this was was just good. Juicy, great batter and both dishes came with a nice sambal chilli sauce that added some nice heat. The salads that came with the meals was a nice cool and crunchy break from the main course. 

Would go back!"}
{"text":"Came by one night to try this new Indonesian sate place located near North York Centre. Ordered a chicken satay entree for dinner and it was great. Chicken was not dry but tasty and delicious. The sate peanut sauce was good and the spicy sauce gave the chicken a nice kick. The rice and salad it came with filled you up (along with some shrimp crackers). We also ate in instead of taking it out and there was plenty of seating available. Overall, good portions and food! Will come back to try more."}
{"text":"We happened to drive by on Yonge St. in North York and spotted the restaurant Satay Sate.  So of course we had to try it!  The place is more like a takeout, with high stools and food is served in take out containers.  Taste and flavour is not bad.  We ordered Nasi Goreng with chicken. (Comes in little cubes) Beef Rendang with coconut rice and Mee Soto. (As a side)

Price is a little high considering no waiters or dish washer.  Just throw out containers and picking up your food from the counter.  Very few selections though.  Parking is awful too.  

If we're in the area, we might go back again but won't be top on the list for us."}
{"text":"My non foodie friends think i am too fussy and only want fancy food but my Food blogger friends understand why i am picky.    Its not about the rice of the food or how fancy the plate u s.  Its about the QUALITY of the food.  In my area there are a lot of restaurants.  Take out and eat in but most are average or below average until now.  I got hungry and noticed the former average Middle Eastern place on Yonge street us now a Satay place.  Well i love chicken Satay so i decided to give it a try.  My mind was blwn on the simplicity and compexity of this place.  The place s clean modern and has a small menu.  They chose their best things.  The owner owns 2 Coras breakfast places so they have experiences in franchises but i guess wanted to do something different.  This place really stands out in an area of Sushi and generic food.  I have never been to Malaysa but i can imagine eating this food there.  I ordered the chicken satay entre which comes with rice and house salad.  I can honestly say the peanut sauce was the best i have ever had in Toronto.  They use their own recipe and roasted peanuts.  It was perfectly done.  Chicken wasn't dry and perfectly seasoned.  I also picked up some shrimp chips.  This corner restaurant just hasn't had the best food so it failed in a few different concepts.  I think people ill go there for their satays from all over once  they try it"}
{"text":"Seen this place when it first opened
So yesterday i was hungry and decided to give it a try
Beef Satay entrée  $11.49
Comes with rice, salad, shrimp crackers and two meat skewers
My initial thought, this wasn't as much as i hoped for the cost

After tasting
Well then, that was definitely worth it!
Sooooo good
On par to flavours of any good southeast asian skewer which is definitely limited in our city
Doused with plenty of sauce and used that sauce on the rice, yum!
They also give you some chili oil too if you wish to spice things up (tho wasnt too spicy for my taste buds, good flavour!)
So i am happy to see this joint in the north york area

Decor of the place is nice and small
Order and pickup, no table service

Looking forward to try more from this place :D"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great hospitality! My husband and I had a great time there. We are looking forward to their new location opening in Scarborough. 

I'm a vegetarian but my husband eats meat and we enjoyed both types of food :)"}
