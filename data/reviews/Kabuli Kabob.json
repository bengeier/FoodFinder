{"text":"Ordered the Sultani and the 1/2 chicken kabob combo.   Quiet disappointed. Here's why: - 1/2 chicken was no 1/2 chicken. Got 2 leg pieces instead. (Owner didn't inform us about this) - Chicken was very very bland - Beef pieces were very tiny - Whole wheat naan was hard and dry - (Free) potato side lack flavor  Note: All the kabob combo prices have gone up by $1. Rice quantity is a little more than bamiyan.  I'd happily pay .50c, $1 to $1.5 extra for each item at Bamiyan across the plaza but this is a small time mom n pop shop."}
{"text":"Great kabobs and service!  My favourite is the tandoori chicken.  Highly recommended and would definitely return."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this pace gets any business. The food is horrible. If you get a glance at the kitchen they are not clean what so ever. I asked the owner for extra hot sauce and he actually gave me attitude. He was very rude. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Owner was really friendly but he seemed to be compensating for the lack of quality his food provided. Ordered the chaplee kabob combo. Afghan food is supposed to be good. This was terrible. Very sub par. The rice was okay. The naan was not fresh. The salad dressing sucked. The kabob was terrible. I want my $12 back. Why isn't this place shut down yet? Should not hav dismissed some of the reviews on here but I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Too bad I was wrong."}
{"text":"Another great little kabob place near Markham and 14th.   It's not as spacious as Bamiyan Kabob as it's one of those takeout restaurants with a few tables, but that also means you don't have to wait nearly as long for your food.  The kabobs were delicious, and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"What can I say- their daily specials at $8 is a very good bang for your buck.  I went on a Tuesday and got the tandoori chicken. I felt the quality is as good as Baamiyan.  No complaints for the price. Was very good tasting food."}
{"text":"Great little kabob house.  Arguably the best tandoori chicken in town!  Came here after hours of aimless wandering at the costco next door.    Service is great here too!  Very friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Delicious. We had The tikka kebobs and the Koobida Kabob plates. Came with tasty rice. The Tikka was tasty well marinated. Rice has nice accompanying flavour. The Koobida kebobs remind me of Arabic Kafta. Came with a side of eggplant with was perfect!    Kudos guys!"}
{"text":"Bland, greasy, inedible, disgusting, made me sick. Words to describe Kabuli Kabob. Horrendous food, please do steer clear of this restaurant.  Half chicken dinner take out, and bunch of complaints for the food. Meal in general extremely oily, bottom of my container swimming in grease. Very poor portion of salad, why do these guys pack one potato in a seperate little foam container? Again the potato is swimming in oil. What's going on?   Biggest complaint of them all is the raw chicken in the centre. I certinaly don't need food poisoning and I'm sure no one else does either, completely unacceptable. Cooking a chicken is not rocket science, burnt on the bottom, raw in the middle... Buyers remorse, refund please?"}
{"text":"I have been to this place many times. Its under new management for past few months!! The food was good before but now its gone better almost to perfection.. their chapali kabab are amazing all their wraps are amazing.. those the the only dishes i have tried and i never got disappointed!! Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"Just dropped in here for the first time, it's a little shop with some seating. Yet it didn't seem cramped. I tried the chicken breast wrap and tandoori kabob plate. The wrap was nice, great to pickup for a quick lunch. I wouldn't get the tandoori chicken again though. Lightly seasoned rice was well cooked. The hot sauce was my favourite thing! Favourful and not too spicy where you can't feel your mouth. Everything seemed to be seasoned with a lot of turmeric, though. So if you don't like turmeric, maybe skip this joint.  Service was great and pretty fast. The gentleman brought us extra sides too!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't have came across this plaza if Bamiyan across the street wasn't super busy. Like a clever consumer, of course I would Yelp it before deciding if we wanted to try Kabuli instead. From the raving reviews, we gave it a shot.  It was 10$ prior to closing, the owner of the restaurant was more than happy to seat us even though we were the only ones there and will delay his time to go home and rest. He even asked us to grab whatever we like from the fridge to drink when we didn't order any. Daily specials are reasonably priced, portion is... the same as everywhere else.   My friend &I ordered the lamb and beef, thinking we can split and try a bit of both. None of us could guess which was which.. The one I thought was beef my friend thought was lamb, the one I thought was lamb, my friend thought it was beef....  The meal not only comes with salad and bread like standard but also potatoes too!"}
