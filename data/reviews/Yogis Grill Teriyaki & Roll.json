{"text":"Been here once before for take out, place has a chemical smell back then and am glad it's gone.  Ate in this time before our movie. Enjoyed the freshly cooked food. Like the healthy options. We came famished, left really full. Place is clean with gtiendly, efficient staff.  I did find the katsu sliced too thin it was no longer tender when fried. Sushi was ok, so was the calamari."}
{"text":"Took forever and a day, they also forgot some things. Definitely a step below the Ray and 101 location but the food was still really good so 4 stars."}
{"text":"I was most impressed with how friendly the staff was. Genuinely nice. I called in an order to go. I think value for money his place is worth it. The portion of the large order was *huge* I have at least enough for lunch tomorrow. And maybe even an additional snack. I would recommend."}
{"text":"One of my sons' favorite places to eat.  Very fresh and fast on those days we need to be in and out quickly."}
{"text":"I usually love this place and eat here all the time. The last time I came in it was terrible. Not only was my food order incorrect, but I called it in about 30 minutes before. No they were not busy and when I got there 30 minutes later I still had to wait ten minutes to get my to go order. Not to mention I was watching whoever was preparing my food and he was talking on his cell phone while he was doing it. Whoever was behind the front desk was rude and very unprofessional. I'm disappointed this time."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place!!!  We are from Hawaii and I had caught a bad cold while on our trip.  I wanted to eat some sort of ramen or soup and we found this place on Yelp.  We were only in Scottsdale for a day and a half and stopped in for dinner.  I had the shrimp tempura udon and my husband had the beef and chicken teriyaki.  The food was outstanding and authentic.  We came back the next day for lunch and dinner.  We brought our daughter who now lives in Scottsdale for lunch and it was a big hit with her too!  The udon noodles are not overlooked and chewy and the sushi rolls were so good.  My daughter has a new local style place to eat!  We miss this restaurant now that we're are back in Hawaii.  We will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good (hence any stars at all)... if you don't mind waiting for it.  BTW.. did you know that a veggie/chicken teriyaki bowl is $8.29, but you can get a veggy bowl for $5 and add chicken for $2?  Apparently the people working the restaurant don't know about this terrible pricing loophole because when I ordered a veggie bowl with added chicken, she charged me over $11.  Then justified by showing me the price for the veggy bowl WITH cicken and then ADDED more chicken on top of that. When I showed her where the menu says  veggie bowl for $5 and add chicken for $2 she seemed like she had no idea that was there.  Then, after I paid, the lady from the back of the kitchen came out and started getting upset with me saying I have to pay a different price.  When I showed her the menu as well, she got in to it with the lady at the register.  Not a good way to run a business.   Like I said, the food really is good, but I don't think I will be coming back here until they figure out what they are doing."}
{"text":"Nice people, good food, low carb options and Wi-Fi, a great lunch spot, always lots of Sriacha and Teriyaki sauce for you, without having to pay extra.  Good place to eat!"}
{"text":"Love their teriyaki everything. Used to be samurai sams and that was horrible. Yogis gives you a good amount of food with every order too. I always get a chicken bowl and gyoza. Love their rolls too. Best teriyaki sauce ever."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch special listed at $7.79 and was given choice of white or dark meat.   I chose white and was not told there would be an additional charge of $1 until I was paying.  Lunch was very small portion maybe 2 oz of meat only.   Cant recommend."}
{"text":"I've come to Yogi's for lunch several times over the past 6 months, mostly because it's the only terriyaki place near where I work.  It used to be Samarai Sam's.  BUT Every time I come in it's something.  Bad service, slow service, wrong order, cold food, stringy, chewy chicken and now this time I order the beef terriyaki bowl only to get it back to work and find that there are little red wiry  hairs (about 1/4 to half inch in length) strewn throughout the meal.  Disgusting!!!       I have no idea what they are....human, animal?? They have the texture of whiskers.  I don't even want to know where they came from, all I know is...I'M DONE!  No more.  I threw away my $7 lunch and ate chips out of the machine for lunch. I hate to say this but this time I WON'T BE BACK!   Good look to the rest of you!"}
{"text":"I am a Teriyaki chicken lover, so this is the spot to go to if your just simply craving some traditional teriyaki with rice bowl or plate. I almost always get the Teriyaki with the steamed Veggies and white rice!! We also truly enjoy their avocado rolls and California rolls, they are both much fuller and cleaner cut, then other places. **** Also the service was nice, overall it is good."}
{"text":"I love Yogis for their teriyaki bowls! I always get the regular sized bowl with chicken and beef. The regular can be a little small for some so if your starving, opt for the bigger size. Prices are reasonable but drinks you do have to purchase separately.   On this day, it was obvious the employee didn't want to be there as customer service wasn't his priority. The condiments table barely had any paper cups to pour your sauces in (soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, siracha) and there is a sign that says you can't take the bottles to your table.  My teriyaki bowl was great and on this day, I also ordered their miso soup. The soup was GOOOOOD. It was piping hot, just how I like it. My sister had the katsu bowl and that was delicious as well.    They do offer a lunch special which I believe runs until 2pm. There are plenty of tables and they have a soda machine."}
{"text":"This is the best fast food Japanese around. Everything is grilled fresh to order. They even do a pretty darn good job with the sushi. Big fan of the teriyaki chicken all white meat. Also love the crunch roll and tempura."}
{"text":"Visited aprox 5:30 PM Friday 05/20/2011. An employee was mopping the whole floor with something similar to Pine-sol. Glad we weren't trying to eat inside, gave my wife a headache. My wife's salmon was overcooked as were the Gyoza (potstickers). The salmon was supposed to come with tempura, the receipt was correct, but no tempura. We were already home when she discovered that. The Arizona Bowl was mostly white rice with a little fake(?) crab on top. If you order \"to go\" check the order before you leave. We will not return."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to eat here. I tried going here for lunch. I ordered a regular sized chicken katsu but was told they could only do large sizes right now because \"the chicken pieces are too big.\" 1. Unless I seriously misunderstand what chicken katsu is, I don't understand why the cook couldn't cut the chicken to accommodate the size I requested. 2. I don't want to eat that much or pay for the large. It felt they were trying to force me to spend more money. The cashier (sweet girl, not her fault), went to the back to ask the cook if he could make a large but he kept arguing with her saying he couldn't. Overall a puzzling and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Great food at a very reasonable price. I got 8 piece sushi plate for 5.80. Service was great, very clean restaurant, food quality good."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. But the customer service was horrible. Was given the wrong food and the man behind the counter said that's what I ordered and refused to remake my food."}
{"text":"We came here for chicken teriyaki. It was very tasty. Had more of a Hawaiian grill flavor teriyaki than we like (compared to a Korean style teriyaki.) My husband was a little disappointed about his spicy chicken teriyaki...he says it wasn't really spicy at all unfortunately. The establishment itself is absolutely beautiful though. Very clean and well kept. Overall we enjoyed our lunch here!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Yogi Grill! Shianne is located at the scottsdale and Shea location and I have to admit I LOVE that she knows my name!! Not because I am there all the time but because she is just really good like that.  Food is priced perfectly!  I have tried several things on the menu - Egg rolls, Pot stickers, teriyaki chicken and beef as well as the tempera. I am not a sushi person and I don't like seaweed! They have a cucumber roll that I add Avocado too and instead of seaweed I get soy paper. It is a buck more I think. But SO WORTH IT!! Oh let's not forget the Avocado salad! YUMMMM  OK so I now go here at least once a week for lunch or dinner and I never tire of it!  Fresh made tasty food that is healthy!"}
{"text":"I ordered a lunch special teriyaki bowl 20 minutes ago and I am still sitting here waiting for it. F this place."}
{"text":"THE worst location.  The wait is terrible. I was told 10 minutes on a phone order, headed up there with our toddlers expecting a quick turn around, sent the hubs in to get the food...WAITED FOR 30 MORE MINUTES.  Thought was a one time fluke and called in an order. Same thing (only this time I stayed home with the babies. He was gone an hour and the order was wrong. The chicken was under cooked and had to be thrown away."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken and beef is our staple here. Call ahead for pickup takes about 15 minutes.   Cucumber Salad had delish dressing. Heads up, it's a lettuce salad with cucumbers on it.   Ask for extra sesame seeds, they add flavor to whatever you order. ouble check your to-go order, often are incorrect or missing sides/items."}
{"text":"The more and more I come here the more and more I LOVE it  I updated this review. Originally 3 starts but bumped it up to 5. The service here is really exceptional for a walk-up-and-order place. Cheyenne (one of the counter girls) is phenomenal and will always be polite, remember your name, and have a genuine smile on her face. The little Asian couple that owns the place is always working and try very hard to make their business succeed. I see the woman here almost every time I'm here and she's polite and always smiles.. Great service!!!   --original review--  Always a fan of Yogis!   I work right across the street from here, and Yogis is always a good option for some good Asian/Teriyaki. (Their sushi is alright, but in my opinion, really isn't worth it for the quality you get)   I generally always get the chicken teriyaki with veggies bowl. The food is always made to order and always tastes good. Chicken is usually always tender, and although sometimes I do get dark meat (yay for my tastebuds but nay for nutritional value) it is always of decent quality. Their spring rolls aren't half bad either, although they are considerably average tasting (but hey, it's a fast-food Asian place, what can you expect). They have unlimited Sriracha and soy sauce, which is always nice if you dine in, but if you order to go, they will charge for extra sauces.   I recommend picking up a punch-card if you live/work close by, because after you buy 9 regular teriyaki bowls you get the 10th free (or something very close to that)"}
{"text":"It was better than I expected as far as \"To Go\" sushi is concerned. It i was kinda pricey though."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today, ordered chicken teriyaki bowl. Chicken was very bland and aged. Pretty sure the chicken was just old and reheated. Ordered pot stickers, very mushy and no sauce to go with it. Probably won't be back as there are many better establishments nearby"}
{"text":"What a delicious, affordable place to get fast food...that's not \"fast food\"! First time coming here, and it definitely won't be the last!"}
{"text":"I would say this is closer to a 3.5 star review.  I ordered the chicken and beef teriyaki bowl.  It was good.  Portions were a little on the small side.  I decided to try this place because it was close to work and I was in a hurry.  You will have to wait for your food."}
{"text":"Great food and Great Prices!!  My favorite is the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl with Brown Rice and they have amazing Sushi Rolls........the Philadelphia Roll and Avocado Roll are my favorites so far.  I love this place!!!!  Definately recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"First and last time in this place. Had chicken and steak bowl tough dry hard.  Ordered calamari deep fried tempura batter not good.  I have had calamari before but not like this."}
{"text":"They're open on Sunday now.  Huge plus in my book.  Yay!"}
{"text":"Food is always good but they are sooooo slow.  It can take 15 minutes after the order is placed."}
{"text":"I had only ever heard of great things about this restaurant, but I am so not impressed. I got the beef teriyaki bowl and it wasn't good. The teriyaki had way too much soy sauce in it and I kept coming across bites of beef that I couldn't eat. I am not impressed at all"}
{"text":"I love Teriyaki bowls and this place has never let me down. They are very consistent, fast and delicious. I order lunch from here occasionally. I like to get the spicy Teriyaki chicken with white meat, low carb style. With the low carb, they substitute rice with fresh steamed veggies. It is great mixture of broccoli, carrots and cabbage. It's a great choice for something healthy, quick and cheap."}
{"text":"My boss and I ordered from here for lunch today and were pleased with our order. I got the teriyaki and tempura combo, which comes with chicken teriyaki, 1 piece of shrimp tempura, 2 pieces of vegetable tempura, 2 pieces of a california roll and a small side salad. My boss got the avocado roll and the spicy tuna roll.  I thought the chicken teriyaki was good, nothing too special and pretty general. The california roll was nice and fresh. The tempura unfortunately was soggy by the time I brought it back to the office, and I felt that the shrimp could have been cooked better. The salad was very, very small and was mainly just iceberg lettuce- it was very underwhelming.   My boss enjoyed his sushi, but he was peeved that their \"avocado roll\" had krab in it. He doesn't eat shellfish, so we had to call to see if it was real crab or not. It was basically a cali roll with avocado on top and eel sauce.  Overall for a quick lunch if you're craving teriyaki it is pretty good, but then again there are a lot of other options in the area too."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken & beef teriyaki bowl with a side of tempura (1 pieces/slice of each of the following: shrimp, zucchini and sweet potato) for delivery.  I really enjoyed the food. Definitely a 3-4 star for quality.   However, the issue has to do with portion size versus cost. For delivery, the price came out to about $22 (including a 15% tip and a $2.99 delivery charge).  That is too much. I was able to easily finish my lunch-sized portion, which is saying a lot because I don't eat very much. I can only imagine if someone with a healthy appetite got the same order, but I'm imagining that they wouldn't be very happy with the quantity.   In short, I'll probably stick with Yoshi's, Croque, or Samurai Sam's for my teriyaki bowl fix. The food is good, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Horrible delays for semi fast food. You should not have to wait 30 minutes for teriyaki chicken.  There are other options for Asian food very close by.  I would not go there again and would not recommend."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch sometimes during my workday and order sushi. My sushi never takes long to come out but my friend's food (usually beef teriyaki) takes a bit longer. Good prices and a healthy alternative from most of the other places open around that area during lunch."}
{"text":"Lost a customer forever...  don't say that you open at 10:30 if you are not ready to serve customers.  Waited 30 minutes for my order. Finally had to leave."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken teriyaki plate with veggies and tempura shrimp to go. When I got home to eat it, it did not taste fresh at all. I was only able to eat half of my order before tossing it in the garbage, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"It is a great Japanese Teriyaki restaurant at fast food price.  I have been addicted to their teriyaki beef bowl and can't stop going there.   Awesome food at reasonable price.  Healthier than any fast food restaurants.  Highly recommended and will go there today for another beef teriyaki bowl.."}
{"text":"Forget about trying to place a pick up order during lunch. Horrible service over the phone and when you go in you still have to wait. What's the point of a pick up order?!"}
{"text":"We love coming here as the Chicken Udon and steak Udon soup come with noodles, meat and lots of great vegetables.  You have many ways to enjoy the soup such as the unique spicy teriyaki sauce or roster Sriracha hot sauce.  They let us split the noodles and save a buck which was cool.  For a real treat we love ordering the sushi crunch roll. The flavor is unexpected and very filling.   The owners are always on site and part of the food preparation.     You do have to be a little patient as everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"The guy at the counter laughed at me when I asked if my combo meals came with drinks. I have been coming here for years and have never had a good or quick experience; this will be my last."}
{"text":"My 9-yr old son loves this place! He's a pretty picky eater, but this place is a favorite. People are pretty friendly, but they oddly seem to run out of things sometimes, like chopsticks or standard takeout containers. For takeout, they're skimpy on sauce. Ask for extra!"}
{"text":"Yogi's does a decent job at providing fast-food Japanese.  Prices are good, and portions are pretty large.  The katsu chicken I tried was nicely crispy and juicy.  I've also had the eel dish, and the eel is a good portion size, with steamed vegetables.  The vegetables weren't anything too exciting, and were a bit bland.  Compared to other fast-food Japanese, there are other places I would frequent more, but if I'm in the area, it's a good choice for quick Asian food."}
{"text":"Whom ever was working today was terrible. The cashier had a terrible attitude. Stood there for over a minute while he stood behind the counter, stabbing tickets and bagging orders, not 2 feet from me, without showing me any sign of acknowledgment. No smile, mumbled the order and didn't even make eye contact. He radiated negative energy and was too unpleasant to be working the cash register. Clearly did not want to be there. I ordered a basic chicken teriyaki bowl. What did I get? Chicken over a bed of rice. No teriyaki. How hard is that? What a joke. I've gotten better service at other Yogi's locations. I will not be back to this one."}
{"text":"I been coming to this location for the last 3 years, they are my favorite teriyaki place in the valley and I tried quit few of them , all dishes are fresh & yummy  The stuff is friendly and place is clean  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. Great place quick and healthy lunch. The people are friendly and the food is made fresh the way I like it."}
{"text":"Classic Teriyaki Bowl with Ginger Salad. I come here on my work days here and there. Can't go wrong if you go simple. Healthy, Tasty, Yum. Always feel energetic after a meal here instead of tired other places.  Will continue to come back time and time again.   Tip - ask for white meat and brown rice."}
{"text":"This is a thoroughly competent \"rice bowl\" establishment, with a somewhat expanded menu.  It differs from fast food places you might find in shopping malls in several ways: 1.  A greater portion of the food is prepared to order and is thus fresher. 2.  There is an expanded menu, including not only teriyaki rice bowls, but also tempura, popular sushi rolls, etc. 3.  The food quality is a bit better.  Prices are reasonable, but not cheap.  And you need to realize that this is an \"order at the counter\" place, although they do bring your food to your table.  It ain't fancy, folks.  But for what it is, Yogis Grill is about as good as you are likely to find.  Hint:  Look for coupons on the Internet, in mailers, etc."}
{"text":"Decided to try this fast food Japanese place cause we were in a hurry but my son had a craving for sushi. I ordered the rainbow roll only but the menu looked really good. The roll was presented really well and it tasted pretty good. The only problem with this place is the service is really slow. I waited for a long time to get my roll. Overall the place with very clean and modern looking. Would I come back? Maybe but not if I'm in a hurry"}
{"text":"Food is great. Fast and good. The only reason for 4 stars is it really depends on who takes your order, if you can make changes. Today I wanted to add just carrots to my teriyaki chicken bowl. Omg... After 3 mins of explaining I just wanted carrots.. Not the whole veggie bowl... I still didn't get carrots!! Grrrrr"}
{"text":"The food was decent that's why I have it at least two stars. The service was ridiculous. My fiancé and I walk in and we're the only two at the register. I order my food and when I'm done, the girl taking my order tells me the total. Hello? My fiancé is going to eat too lol! I'm like uh... my fiancé is standing right next to me he's also going to order. So we order then sit. 5 min later my fiancé's teriyaki bowl comes out. 15 minutes later still no food for me. I walk up to the counter and ask them WWWHHHYYYYYYYY they would bring my fiancé's food FIFTEEN MINUTES BEFORE MY FOOD comes out (and my food hasn't even came out yet). So she goes to the back and my food is sitting there, ready. Come on people. Get it together. Not coming back here again. The food was okay though."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. I've had food at other Yogis locations and the food here tastes nothing like what I've ordered in the past. It took me 20 minutes to get my food and it tasted gross. I ordered the butter  Garlic noodles and they tasted neither garlic nor buttery. In fact, It tasted like someone poured cinnamon all over it. Bleh! The place is also really dirty. The condiments had crust around the edges like they haven't been wiped down EVER! Don't come to this location."}
{"text":"Good place for a cheap casual lunch. Has a simple cafe feel to it. I enjoyed my chicken teriyaki bowl, but the egg rolls were kind of mushy. I will be back to try their sushi rolls (other patrons seem to like 'em)."}
{"text":"My roll fell apart repeatedly, was difficult to eat due to poor production. The generous serving of miso had no tofu, just a few shreds of nori and a sprinkle of green onion. It was served in a styrofoam container with just poor takeout spoons.   Worst, the TV is tuned to CNN, and is blaring horrible and biased talking-head political pundits. Needless to say, the atmosphere really sucks.   Free wifi thanks to Dunkin Donuts next door."}
{"text":"One of my friends said they liked this place so I decided to stop in and get some food to go for lunch. Sadly, I was just not impressed.   I came in and there were a couple of people in the restaurant. I was able to immediately place my order, and the girl working the counter was super nice and efficient. As I was waiting for my food, I saw this girl single handedly take orders, deliver food to tables and handle any questions or concerns that were thrown her way like a pro. As I waited and waited, more people came streaming in to order and as a result, began to wait too. You could see some people were starting to get agitated because it was taking awhile. Again, not this poor girls fault. I know lunch hours can be busy, but she was the only person working the front and she had to go into the back to check on items several times while I was there waiting. Just doesn't seem efficient for your busiest time.   Once I finally got my food, it was okay. I got the large chicken bowl with white meat (Extra $ of course) but I just didn't think it was worth it, especially for just chicken and rice. Maybe teriyaki isn't my thing, but sadly it was pretty unmemorable."}
{"text":"I've only gotten chicken teriyaki with green onion the past several times and it has always been good. The service has always been quick and friendly. Great for quick lunch or for to go orders"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Yogis Grill in Tempe marketplace and get the spicy tuna bowl. Love it at that location! Tried it at this location and was VERY disappointed. The Tempe location gives a scoop of tuna, this location gave a half scoop IF THAT. For $1 more you can drive over to ahi poke bowl and get 2 scoops plus way better rice and toppings. Wait time was long too and the man working the register clearly doesn't care about customer service. Won't be going back"}
{"text":"teriyaki chicken is the best and the price is right. If you are a regular like me get the punch card. Can't go wrong with a free bowl."}
{"text":"I love the chicken bowls with brown rice.  Relatively healthy, and tastey especially with the siracha sauce on it.  This location also has some really good unsweetened iced tea.  It did take a little longer to get my food though."}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick Teriyaki Bowl and side of sushi.  It appears to be family run-a bonus.  They have a lunch special daily.  Another bonus!"}
