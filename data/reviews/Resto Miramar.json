{"text":"Ordered delivery once. The delivery was reasonable, under 45 minutes. Ordered a smoke meat sandwich, a shish taouk plate, a poutine and a burger.  Big mistake ordering from a restaurant that has over 100 items on their menu, nothing was authentic at at.  The Shish taouk chicken was sandwich chicken you would find on a club sandwich, not authentic shish taouk chicken. The hummus/garlic sauce or whatever they call a sauce tasted like tzatziki sauce. The pita was more of a greek pita and the rice was not the typical rice found in more authentic middle eastern restaurant.  The poutine was alright and so was the burger. The smoke meat sandwich was more bread than meat. Clearly microwaved smoke meat. The portions where also ungenerous.  The food and experience was decent, but wouldn't reorder even if I was starving to death.  L. John Dory Twitter: @LJohnDory"}
{"text":"Très ordinaire !!  Nous avons pas reçu ce que nous avons commandé....  On s'est ramasser avec une poutine froide, des ailes qui goûte le pfk, et des gâteaux dégueulasses....  Assez décourageant pour 40$...  Nous avons pas rappellé vu que la livraison a pris 65 minutes....on a tout jeté et mangé des toats. On rappellera jamais !"}
{"text":"The meal: Spaghetti and meatballs.   The Pros: huge portion for the price  The meatballs were pretty flavorful   The Cons: The scent put me off. It smelled like Indian food. I love Indian food but I don't want my Italian meal to smell or taste like it.   The sauce was bad. It didn't taste like tomato sauce at all. It tasted like a watered-down can on Chef Boyardee. And there might have been some Indian spices in there I really don't know.  And then there was almost a full brick of cheese on top.   Nothing was offered with the meal, no bread or salad. I ordered both. Not worth it. Soggy garlic bread and lettuce with bacon bits, cheap croutons and dressing.   This is what regret tastes like, all three bites that I could stomach.  I would not recommend this place."}
