{"text":"Fun atmosphere for sports-minded people. Bar is well stocked and happy hour prices are good !"}
{"text":"Whatever you do here... DO NOT USE A CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD! I have been going to Big Al's since Frank opened it. I usually stop by when I am in town. The food is good and reasonable. But in the last 18 months, I have had my card number stolen twice here. Just stopped by and had some lunch on Saturday. Sure enough I got a call from B Of A with some fraudulent charges on it Monday morning. I called my friend that used his card there last week. Yep, fraud charges on it. I knew something was up when the bartender told me, \"the system is down, we have to do this the old fashion way\". There you go, my card number just sitting around waiting to be stolen. I have been going to Franks Places since he was at Loafers, but I'm going to drop this place. Now I have to get a new card. You need to reign these people in Frank!"}
{"text":"The service was pretty spectacularly poor. There was one server for the entire pub and while it was relatively slow we rarely saw our server.  After waiting 40 minutes for a pizza we inquired as to the status of our food, for which she gave us attitude, and later emerged to tell us the pizza just went in the oven. When it finally arrived it was decent, definitely not bad, but also not worth an hour+ wait. This place is good for a big group of people who are there to drink and content with appetizers arriving....eventually. But for a couple out to dinner, avoid it."}
{"text":"I really like this bar, great service and the average bar food you'd pretty much expect. Lots of TVs and darts, etc. It's a fun place to go."}
{"text":"Love this place I have been going here for years. The food is always good and I never have a problem with the staff. Waiters are very attentive never had to wait on refills or anything. Nice location, great staff, great food and reasonably priced. 
My personal favorites are the calzones and the chicken fajita wrap."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check it out, well I went for lunch today. I thought it was a cool little place. They have a great beer selection,  a well rounded menu and food was pretty decent. I will be going back."}
{"text":"My first time going to this place. It wasn't to crowed when we got there, but once it reached a certain time (past 10pm) the atmosphere changed. Which I didn't mind, because I'm from NY which means I'm a city girl.

The service was good also. Even though it was getting busy the waiter kept coming and asking if we needed anything. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was good. Went for Thursday night football. 49 cent wings! Yeah!"}
{"text":"Decent Food and decent price.  Overall the service needs improvement and I think they should remodel the place.  It is not very family friendly."}
{"text":"Got there at 6:30 on Friday night and were immediately seated. Got appetizer at 7:45 and finally got our meal at 8:35. They were not that busy in the eating area. Will never return because of the wait and we were not the only people waiting either. If you want your order lost and a long wait then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Aweful service. You don't feel welcome at this place. I live close by and thought i d have a place to go if i don't want to drive but they won't see me or my friends, never again!"}
{"text":"Chose this place on a whim cause their menu on their website looked good.Apparently according to the bartender they arent associated with their website which resulted in our bill being almost $10 more. The bartender seemed to have cared less about their website displaying much lower prices. We aeemed to have waited over 25 min for our order that w√†s take out. Never again. If you aren't buying beer or liquor the staff could care less about you."}
{"text":"Bathrooms while dated were spotlessly clean. I had the spaghetti and salad special and added Italian sausage.  It was enough for 3 people and under $8.  The salad fresh and Italian sausage fantastic and not greasy.  My husband are the bread stick and it met his satisfaction.  He had the Reuben hotdog with fries and it was very good if you love sauerkraut which is what a good Reuben is all about.  We shall return."}
{"text":"Please note there are 2 Big Al locations in the Charlotte area.  This Albemarle road location is not affiliated with the other location near Lake Norman.    I must say northerner's that move to Charlotte are used to having easy access to great wings all over the northern states.  Here in Charlotte the wing joints just don't get it.. either too greasy or too rubbery where the meat/fat snaps back and pops you in the lips!!  Not Big Al's Albemarle.. It is here you will find hands down the best wings in Charlotte.  The key to excellent wings is CRISPY.  Big Al's Albemarle Road offers what they call \"OVEN RUN\" where they place the wings back in the oven and broil them to a nice even crisp that is absolutely fantastic.  It is true buffallo wings that have an excellent taste.  They do not skimp on celery and blue cheese like many other places do either.  The pizza is great too as well as the basket of loaded chilly cheese fries.  Add in the fact they serve good old fashion pitchers of beer and what else can you say?  Give them a try and ask for \"oven run\" on your wings.  The staff is always nice and appreciate their customers!  Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place. But they are always rude and they never fail to get my order terribly wrong."}
{"text":"Bartender was awesome. 
We sat in the bar at a tall top and had service better than when sitting at the bar in most places from the bartender. 
Good drink specials. Ordered nachos, they were smaller than expected (had tons of toppings though) so ended up turning into a taco salad near the end. 

Great bar atmosphere, millions of TVs, not a bad seat in the house. Pretty small building though, I can imagine it being packed during games or weekend nights. 

They serve the full menu until close, which I'm a huge fan of. They have a pretty giant menu of \"ok\". The burgers- they're ok, pasta- ok, fried bar food, hey, its ok. The prices- also fine. Drink some more, the food probably gets tastier (guessing lots of frozen happens here- its fine if you aren't expecting the next Iron Chef to pop out of the kitchen). 

Overall its a nice version of a clean dive, so to speak. Your hometown beer closet. Fun bar- I can't ever imagine feeling out of place here."}
{"text":"Had the \"Fraunch dip\" soggy not much meat or flavor. Tots were not crisp and had what seemed like Rosemary added. Will not return. The barstools were all torn. Not a nice atmosphere at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch wide array of menu items and beer specials
Had a Reuben hotdog and mac & cheese both a very good
FriendlyService"}
{"text":"fast service with a smile, the girls there are really cool and a little rough but I like that. best wings in town by far... great place for kids but bring quarters for the video games and sit in the back ... good place to watch a game and drink beer with friends."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch sometimes since it's close to my work. Really impressed with their turkey Reuben, absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"They have moved across the street to the old Seafarers place. I haven't been yet, but business seems to be jumping!"}
{"text":"went back to big al's last week after not being there for a while and while the food was good as always, I have to echo what the last poster her from April stated. The place is a sh-thole.....dirty inside and out, bathrooms seriously look like the urinals could come out of the walls and the toilets are terrible, everything on the walls looks like it was last cleaned in 1999, ceiling tiles look even older and saggy in spots...I first started going there in 1992-3 and seriously i don't think ANYTHING there has been changed or updated since then, or even cleaned much, inside or out. Theres a big difference in trying to be a \"dive\" type bar and just a place where its obvious no one cares about the place.....also they've had that big muddy lot beside them for 20 yrs; take some patio pavers or lay some gravel down and get the ton of people who are littering your sidewalk smoking off to the side where you don't have to wade thru them.....you guys make a ton of dough there..invest some of it"}
{"text":"Went there just today with a friend to have some pizza and wings. For bar food it was pretty damn good and priced just about right. Beer was inexpensive as well. Staff was friendly and even the patrons (had to have been all regulars) we nice. All you could want in a dive-y strip mall type place.

The only major downside was the inside was about as dirty as I have ever seen a bar/restaurant in charlotte. The ceiling was stained from years of cigarette smoke (how long has it been since you could smoke inside?) and it seemed like every square inch of the miles of sports paraphernalia on the walls was covered in dust or grim. The bathroom looked like it was in a serious state of disrepair and wall tiles were practically coming off the walls.

This is a place I would recommend probably getting takeout from if you live in the area. Other than the food the atmosphere isn't one that beckons you to stay unless you are up to date on your immunizations."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Big Al's at the lake. As soon as you walk into the bar it feels like your local hometown bar from back home. The staff treats everyone like they are a regular. You always have a full drink in front of you and there are plenty of tv's to watch the game. The biggest reason why Al's is so good is the wings. They have the best wings in the Charlotte area period. I recommend getting the traditional buffalo style and also try the honey habanero. Their wings are huge and  have unreal flavor!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! Slow service. Terrible food. I will not return 

Well I lied... 2nd visit was way better . Lunch special chicken tenders tossed in hot sauce for the win!! 

And then again for a 3rd time...re-ordered the tenders! Quick cheap meal"}
{"text":"This bar has some of the best dive bar style in Charlotte. The staff is really friendly and so are the patrons. So if you like a really bar check this place out."}
{"text":"Service was great, staff was great, food was great. What more could you want? Susanne, our waitress was simply the best. I will be back a lot more."}
{"text":"3rd time at new location will be back with friends the service is always on point but this waitress was the best attentive attitude was exceptional and a nice person her name is Mattie look for her  food was good as usual and the kitchen stays open super late bathrooms were clean"}
{"text":"The food was terrible. There were 7 of us and no one had anything good. The burgers were dry and tough. To make matters worse, our server was rushed and appeared stressed out and overworked. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My best friend and I have been coming here for years and years... like 14! We used to go every week purely for the Buff-which sandwich and their amazingly good sweet tea. Now we go maybe once or twice a year when we suddenly remember we haven't been in forever since neither of us lives anywhere near there anymore. The food never fails and the prices are good. I've never had issues with service here like some other reviewers. True they tend to leave you alone to eat in peace and if you need something I can see how that would be annoying. Otherwise it's perfectly adequate service. 

As for the cleanliness of the place, first of all it's a bar and it looks like a bar. It's always rather dark in there and hard to see and it hasn't really been updated much but honestly it's a local bar lol.  Not sure what people are expecting.  

Honestly I come here when I'm feeling nostalgic and want a great chicken sandwich/fries and sweet tea :-)"}
{"text":"Love Big Al's  I always say support your neighborhood restaurants over the big chains if/wehn they are deserviing of support.  Big Al's earns our support.

I am a big fan of the nachos where they are very accomodating.  For me no lettuce; no onions; no jalapenos; no sala extra sour cream.  There chili is great where I am a big eater yet always take home leftover when I order as my meal.

Great wings too...pay extra to have them run them thru the pizza oven."}
{"text":"Not much for looks but the hospitality was great. The food was reasonable and very tasty."}
{"text":"The food I have had here is always great!  The fried pickles come with an awesome spicy ranch sauce and the pickles are not overly breaded and the pickle flavor shines through.  The wings are good, and I had the Philadelphia steak and cheese today which was exceptional! The bread was crisp on the outside and soft inside and the texture enhanced the filling instead of disguising it like at other places.  The waitress we usually have has a long long blond  pony tail and is very efficient and pleasant.  The liquid marijuana shooter is my favorite thing on the menu and my favorite drink in town..who would have thought it on albemarle rd???? It is greenish blue aqua colored and is like a tropical explosion in your mouth.  A good place to find men with testosterone who are having after work drinks too!"}
{"text":"I've been going there for more than 10 year's. I have always enjoyed the food and atmospher. The server's are always pleasant. The wings and pizza are awesome."}
{"text":"I've only had the wings and they are great. The were crispy, fried to perfection and saucy.?The best wings in East Charlotte. The decor is very dated but the patrons don't seem to mind. Friday is a meeting spot to relax and unwind for people from all walks of life."}
{"text":"Walking into Big Al's in Cornelius is like walking into a sports bar in Buffalo, or what I imagine walking into a sports bar in Buffalo to be like.

Bills jerseys and pictures adorn the walls, and if there was even the slightest of doubts this is a football haven, a board beside the bar ticks down the minutes until opening kickoff...even if it's months away!

This is one of the reasons I like Big Al's...it doesn't pretend to be something its not. It's a straight-up sports bar.

Yeah, its not incredibly spacious. Yeah, its smoky. 
The wings are good though, as is the chicken parmesan sub and the pizza.
There are plenty of TVs, and live music off-and-on throughout the week.
And should the need to escape the inside atmosphere arise, there is a small patio out front to retire to.

If you're looking for a low-key evening, have a hankering for tossing a few beers back at something resembling a neighborhood pub, or need a good place to yell at the TV on NFL Sunday, Big Al's has a spot waiting for you."}
{"text":"This was going to be my new go to spot.  Hooked up with 4 friends here, a few times.  Each time we ordered a meat lovers pizza. Which was great every time. Then!!!! I went back by myself,  just the pizza.  It was not cooked! Raw! Rubber,  all wrong. Sent it back. Waiter bought another pizza back on the house. It was worst.  Anyway..  found out they have a new cook ..old cook not there anymore. I will be back we they hire the right cook again"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger!  I always have the same thing, so I can't speak about other dishes!"}
{"text":"After awaiting weeks to find parking , I finally got to try the new location for Big Al's. Seems like the wait staff needs help and the kitchen as well. Not impressed with the experience :("}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place. Love all there food especially the chicken and fries. I also go there on mondays to play Bingo where you can get money or coupons for food. 

Ordering to go is also great. Always ready in 15-20 min."}
{"text":"I flew into Charlotte on Tuesday and met a couple of business associates there for lunch. We weren't looking for anything fancy, just wanted a quick lunch so we can go about our day. As you enter into the place, It did have the bar/pub look. Which is not a bad thing. 

One of my associates ordered the wings, another ordered a sandwich. I ordered the rueben sandwich. Now, when I see Rueben on a menu, I normally think of pastrami or corned beef for the meat. Nope. This place gave you a choice of turkey, ham, or roast beef. I was going to order something else but, for some reason, I just had a craving for a rueben. I ordered the roast beef. 
The service was friendly. Nothing special, just friendly. The food came and everything seemed ok. My friend said his wings were average. Not great, not horrible. My other friend said his sandwich was ok. As was my rueben. We paid the check and left. 

Here is where it starts to get interesting. For the next couple of hours, my rueben kept repeating on me. I'm sure it's happened to all of you at some point or another. Where you keep tasting the food over and over again and it tastes worse each time. I don't want to get into the gory details but by 5:00 o'clock I was in my hotel room feeling like I was about to die. I spent the next 18 hours getting very intimate with the toilet. Yep, food poisoning! I can't say for certain which ingredient caused it, but if I were the cook in that establishment, I would throw out everything used in making that sandwich and start fresh. I wouldn't be surprised if the Thousand Island dressing has sat on the counter in the kitchen just a little bit longer than it should have. So needless to say, I will never, ever, ever, visit this sh*t hole again."}
{"text":"Inexpensive good eats with friendly people.
We moved to the area not too long ago and we've already been several times. There's plenty on the menu to choose from. The burgers and hot dogs are great. And we've had the pleasure of having CiCi as our waitress already couple of times. She's always friendly and always busting her rear."}
{"text":"A friendly neighborhood type bar where yankees and southerners live in perfect harmony. A pretty friendly place with its share of regulars. I can't really comment on the food as I only drink there. The bartenders are friendly and fix a strong drink if they know you."}
{"text":"Loved coming here!!!  Always great food, good service & fun atmosphere!  Very very sad & disappointed to see they are closed!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here on multiple occasions and had good food. I feel like the food and experience has declined since they have moved locations. Last night my mother and I shared a sandwich and we both got sick. We do not live together and that is the only thing similar that we had eaten. I brought the illness up with them privately (not asking for anything, just a heads up) and my concerns were not taken seriously."}

{"text":"This bar was a lot of fun! I loved the cheap/reasonably priced drinks, I loved the diverse crowd. I can't speak for the food since I ate elsewhere before the bar but overall atmosphere gets 5 stars. One thing I would like to say, this place needs to check who they allow to play live music in there. The guys who played Saturday 3/1, Kevin Marshall and Scott Sutton, were incredibly racist and made no qualms about it in their songs. I'm a white guy and I was extremely offended by their ignorance. If you read this, Big Al's, don't let these a-holes play in your bar anymore. Also, they were way too loud. Good bar for a night out with friends, just check the schedule for live music and make sure the aforementioned \"musicians\" aren't there."}
{"text":"In the past I Have ordered pizza and liked it but I ordered a pizza late last night and quite frankly it was horrible and way overpriced . I don't know if it was because it was so late or they changed the way they make their pizzas . But probably will not order from here again."}
{"text":"Great food, fun place to hang out. Low key vibe...only complaint is the slow service about three out of every four visits. Sometimes you'll get lucky though and it's on point but usually you'll be borderline ignored if they don't recognize you.  Sucks to say that but it's true unfortunately."}
{"text":"Big Al's used to be wedged into a tiny strip mall (it's not really a mall, even - it's just a couple of storefronts) along Albemarle, and it was there for many years. So long in fact that it was perhaps a good idea to move, as they had been there even before the indoor smoking ban was lifted, if memory serves, and so when the time came to clean out, there was still a certain aroma to the place.

The problem is that when you try and move from a tried and true location, it never quite works. While they are not far from that spot, and they have a gigantic space both inside and out, and they are located beneath a monstrous billboard (which still maintains the inner workings of the old whale even, should they decide to put that back to work), something of the magic has been lost. It's just not the same as it was.

While the menu is likely the same - I don't think it has changed at all in better than 15 years, with plenty of \"Als\" sprinkled throughout to make cute names of different offerings - the service really suffers at times, and the food itself even seems to be lost in the cavernous facility.

The one spot that seems happening is around the bar, which reminds a bit of the old space, slightly cramped and friendly, if perhaps a bit too much. But wade out into the gigantic seating area and you're a bit on your own."}
{"text":"How can you not like a place with a name like that?  Well, it's actually easy for two reasons.  One is because the menu is so littered with the word \"Al\"  that it's almost impossible to read in some places.  A few places might be cute, but as many as this has is a bit over the top.

Two is that this place is best regarded as a sports bar, not a place to eat.  If you do that, it's probably okay.  But if you want service where you sit down and actually receive service, you're likely to be disappointed.

If you don't mind either of those things, it's not bad.  The food is actually decent and the portions are pretty good.  You can almost always take something home, even if you just get a sandwich.  The prices aren't bad either."}
{"text":"Went through to Big Al's for the first time last night and was pleasantly surprised by the nice mix of diverse people and everyone seemed well fed and happy.  TVs everywhere.  Had kind of a regular feel about it.  My waitress Krissy was terrific, friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Wings and Chicken  Fingers, both mild.  Good sized portions and side dips.  When I left with my left overs, Krissy brought me another Sprite to go on the house.
Nice!"}
{"text":"This place looks like a dive and maybe it is but the food is great. Of course they have a bar which remains busy. Plus they have outdoor seating on the patio. I usually sit inside on what appears to be a old short church pew or bus station bench. They have plenty of TVs to watch. 

The servers are ALWAYS nice as can be. Normally we go on Sunday for the special. All i can say about the wing special is that the price is right and the wings are tight.  I tried the hotdog it was very good. The have tator tots, crinkle cuts and curly fries. The house salad is simple yet simply delicious. 

Ask about there daily food, drink and entertainment specials while you are there"}
{"text":"Great service and good food at awesome prices (especially lunch). My waitress is always attentive and pretty much knows my order before i order lol. They have some of the best chicken tenders and curly fries you'll ever eat."}
{"text":"Yummy!! Lots of seating on the inside. Food is pretty good. Tons of options of salads and burgers and sandwiches. Wait staff was nice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So I've always had Pizza here and tell everyone how amazing their pizza is here. My favorite is the Blue Cheese pizza with chicken. It had so much Blue Cheese and toppings, it was amazing. So we go back here on Monday Dec.19th 2016 on Bingo night. And I swear to you, either they have a new chef and he had no idea what he was doing or they completely changed the recipe and cut down on the pizza. They changed the thick pizza to a freaking thin crust. I was highly disappointed and I'm going to try it one more time in the future and if it's the same thing, I'm never coming back. It's like asking for a Filet Mignon and actually getting a beef shank. You can't change a masterpiece and expect people to like it.. What a shame!"}
