{"text":"C'est du Valentine quoi. Même si t'essaies de faire des rôteux chez toi ce sera toujours différent, soit mieux soit pire. Mais Valentine reste inégalé dans la saucisse vapeur servie sur slaw sur-vinaigrée en moins de 60 secondes. Une valeur sûre. Dans tous les sens du terme."}
{"text":"Whenever I return to Montreal, a plate or four of poutine is always in order. And Valentine is one of the fast food places dedicated to serving up this dish, and doing it just right. My favorite is the Poutine Saucisse, with steamed hot dog rounds, whereas my sister prefers the Poutine Extrême, with hot dog and ground beef chunks. Afterwards, of course, she is known for falling asleep from a poutine coma.

On a recent visit, we were shopping downtown and made a detour to the food court for this quintessentially Quebec meal. I ordered the smallest portion available given that dinner was just a few hours away, yet the bowl of crunchy fries, gravy and cheese curds was huge; an even larger portion is available, if you can believe that.

First things first, bury all the cheese curds to achieve melty goodness. Then, dig in.

I love the French fries here, both crunchy and tender, as well as the decent portion of cheese curds. Yum."}
{"text":"Valentines is a fast food chain in Montreal. I expected nothing but your typical fast food quality, however, I needed a quick snack and Valentine's stuck out like a shrine calling to me.

I ordered the combo meal which contained a cheeseburger, which they pan fry and customizes specific to your order (nice touch), a large helping of poutine and a large coke. The poutine is on par with many of the touristy poutine joints that plague Montreal. The reason I mention this is the poutine here is half the price and the same (if not better) quality.

If you're looking for a quick snack and poutine, check out Valentine."}
{"text":"Decently cheap, quality is ok and they serve fast!

We weren't expecting much from a fast food poutine joint but Valentines is fast and the food is ok. I wouldn't recommend this as a place to get some world class poutine but it was a good snack."}
{"text":"Checked this place out while playing tourist in Montreal. I ordered a poutine regular size and it was $6 but came out a lot more because of tax. It was a takeout place and they speak English so you don't have to worry if you don't speak french. 

I wasn't impressed with this Canadian dish. It's suppose to originate from Quebec. It's made of French fries, cheese curd and gravy. Very salty...I wasn't impressed...it's basically the disc fries you get at your local diner back in the states but with actual cheese and not cheese curd."}
{"text":"They say the crappier the place is, the better the poutine is and they're absolutely right! 

Not trying to say that Valentine is the worst place in the world but it's general fast food. You're gonna have average hot dogs, average food, but the poutine is pretty damn good!!!

We got two types of poutine. Of course you have to go with the classic poutine with cheese, gravy, and fries! But then we also got the poutine italienne which was surprisingly really good! 

The poutine italienne has red marinara sauce instead of the classic gravy and it was actually super good. It was a sweeter red sauce which was super flavorful with the cheese. It must be the little bits of carrots that they put in the sauce 

The fries for both were also very good! Piping hot and cut nice and thick, complements that cheesiness and sauce really well!

Overall, it's some of the best poutine in Montreal to get, even though it's just an average fast food joint."}
{"text":"Valentines has the squeakiest cheese. This is one of the reasons why their poutine is one of my most favorite in Montreal. 

You see, I am a poutine connoisseur. I've been eating poutine for almost 20 years. Almost two decades, to be exact.

For me I don't care about ambience. I care about three things: gravy, cheese and fries.

Grady cannot be too watery or two abundant. Cheese must be plentiful but very stringy. No grating. Only curds. Fries must be thick, taste like potatoes (be delicious on their own.) overall, the poutine has to be very hot. Hot enough to melt the cheese so that it can be stretched a full arms length. We are talking the length of pho noodles.

And Valentines is right up there. The cheese is great, the gravy is awesome and the fries are really good. Their steamies are good too."}
