{"text":"i'm being generous with 3 stars.  it was the sweet chinese waitress that made it for us.  she was very patient, attentive, and absolutely lovable.  the food is another story.  the papadam came out stale.  we asked for a new one and it came out crispy but still about a day or two old.  the bhindi masala was made in a baingan bartha style sauce which is unusual but edible.  the aloo gobi was flavorful but a little too saucy.  the vegetable biryani was too sticky and not crazy about the frozen pea/corn/carrot chunks in it.  the food is edible but i wouldn't come back.  call me a food snob."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars because of the 1 star that some disgruntled desi connoisseur gave them. They're more of a 4, but I really liked my meal so I think that they deserve a good rating.  Alright, the breakdown: A modest buffet of all the classics for $10.95 at lunch time. personally I like to eat later than at noon, and having the lunch buffet open till 4pm is a nice treat for me. I get to have a buffet \"dunch (dinner-lunch)\" at my own pace.  Now, I like a buffet. Mmmmmmm, buffet... With freshly made naan brought to your table by friendly staff and with many different full-flavoured curries to dip them in, this was a very nice meal. My friend and I left stuffed to the brim on their awesome and tender rogan josh. The butter chicken was great as well and my personal favourite, the saag bhaji, didn't disappoint.   All in all, it was a buffet of well-spiced curries that made me smile. I recommend going here if you're in the area and like to pig out."}
{"text":"This place was close to our hotel and we were craving Indian food, so we stopped in.  Upon arrival, it was super disorganized and nobody greeted us for a while.  Eventually, an older woman led us to our table without even a greeting and the disappeared.  We assumed it was okay to go to the buffet and got up to eat, but she waved her arms as if to indicate not to eat.  After a few minutes of just sitting there, I got up and went to the buffet anyway.  She brought us water, but didn't ask if we wanted anything else.  The food was lukewarm and mediocre at best.  Some of the curries had tiny bone bits that were barely visible and I can't count how many times I bit down on something gross.  The naan was soggy and, although it tasted good, was not the crispy yumminess I was craving.   I left feeling unsatisfied and sad that I wasted a dinner in Toronto on this place."}
