{"text":"Blown away!  These people are so nice and accommodating (we came in with 3 small kids).  They kept bringing out more chips while we waited.  The woman at the register overheard my kids wanting more rice and brought out 2 dishes of rice on the house.  

Food was top notch at this price level.  High ratings are well deserved."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last week with high hopes as Mexican food is my absolute favorite cuisine! 

I walked in and was taken back by the lack of customer service that came from the staff. I ordered a taco salad and a hard shell taco on the side. The one plus is the food didn't take more than 15 mins to get to our table.

Once it arrived I looked at my \"taco salad\" and thought this isn't a taco salad, there was no hard shell, beans or nothing! It was a plate of shredded lettuce, ground beef, cheese and a small dollop of sour cream. I asked the young man who brought it if I could have ranch he said they didn't have it. I said ok can I have thousand island he says sorry we don't have any dressing. I'm thinking to myself how do you have salads on your menu with no dressing available?! 

My taco looked appetizing until I realized it wasn't even hard shell but a flour tortilla that had been fried. I was hoping for a corn hard shell. Plus it was overt greasy and the salsa on it was terrible! 

I left unimpressed and felt it was way overpriced. I don't plan on going back, save your money and go to Las Fuentes or Rio Mirage."}
{"text":"We tried this place after a recommendation and a pic was post up. 

Let me just say. This place is the best by far for burritos! We tried the red chili, beef and green all enchilada style. It was delicious and we will definitely be back! Very clean, affordable and Family owned and operated. They take pride in preparing fresh food daily. I would highly recommend any thing on the menu. Real plates silverware and now serving beers and margaritas!!!"}
{"text":"This is a really great family owned joint that serves up some delicious Mexican food...I ordered the 3 rolled tacos.  I was concerned that it would not be enough and I asked how big each one of those bad boys were...they said you will be full with just the three and there was no need to order more for one person.  

I was not disappointed.  The rolled tacos came out and where double the circumference in size than what you usually see for a rolled taco.  It was very tasty and one of the wonderful things they do as well is serve real Mexican Coke...yes, this makes a big difference because Mexican coke has real sugar cane and not high fructose corn syrup.  It is always worth it to spend a bit extra on your coke if it is a Mexican Coke!

Another plus is that the staff goes around and asks you if you want more chips or another drink.  They are attentive to if you need any condiments and walk around to make sure you are happy with what you ordered and if they can add anything to make your meal more enjoyable.

I also like the old diner plates that they use, it makes the place seem more homey and just more authentic and it really shows that they are a family run business.  Not sure but I think there are a whole family running that kitchen because they seem so interconnected and they get your food out with loving care.

Please go here to eat!  Don't go to a franchise, we don't want any more of those popping up all over!  Keep it real and go to Daniel's."}
{"text":"The food is always Great tasting and Always Fresh, the people and owners are down to earth and Very friendly!! The Greatest Mexican food in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"Daniel's is a well-run, well-kept \"Mom & Pop shop.\" The dishes are traditional, so you know just what to expect, and they are authentic, so you know the food will be muy delicioso! The staff is very inviting and accommodating as well. Definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, enormous portions, and friendly staff.  The salsa is so good that I'm going to forego my usual burrito enchilada style and just dump a cup of salsa over it. The cheese quesadilla comes with a generous garnish of Pico and olives. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here to try something different, must say that I'm surprised that it taste just like Taco Bell! I got the super rafter log burrito and it was huge, but for $12 it should be! Only reason it gets a 3 is because of size, if I wanted Taco Bell I would've went there! If this place wants to survive off of ground beef being the main staple in most dishes (substitutions are $2), the taste should not taste like Taco Bell that I can get for much cheaper! I wanted chicken, but they only had shredded chicken and in a burrito I think chunks of chicken would be better. I intentionally had my wife try the burrito, but didn't tell her my thoughts so she could form her own opinion. 

She tasted it and immediately said it tastes like Taco Bell! She had the super burrito with Carne Asada ($2 substitution, but super burrito had more ingredients than the regular Carne Asada burrito). The Carne Asada was in strips and not chunks, seems more like it was for fajitas than a burrito. With that said, for having spent $20+ on two burritos I could've went to Del Taco in the very next parking lot and got more food and it wouldn't have tasted like Taco Bell! Oh, almost forgot. The chips and salsa was OK, but they only gave us one small container for two burritos and some chips! Actually, the more I think about it I'll give them a 2 star because it shouldn't taste like TACO BELL!!!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I stop here 15 min before closing, best food we have had, met the owners never been to a place that treated us so wonderful, thank you for being so lovely, we are coming back and spreading the word of greatness"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. The serving size is extremely generous. The staff is beyond attentive, kind, and courteous. The prices are great. Location and parking are very convenient. We will be back."}
{"text":"I make better Mexican food than this place does. No flavor at all. Bland hamburger, tomato sauce out of a can. I wasn't sure if I was eating Italian or Mexican food. Get some cumin and chili powder. At least try to have some flavor. They did use cheddar cheese. They could have really went for it with some American cheese food slices. Don't waste your money or time here."}
{"text":"This is a great Mexican joint.  Family owned and operated and from Southern California. I went with 5 stars because I enjoyed all aspects of the dining experience. My family of four made it a dinner night for less than $10 per person (including one beer).  I highly recommend this place and pit the food quality, and cleanliness, above some of the other more well known places.  The service was quick and the food was wonderful.  Will be a staple when the kids can't agree!"}
{"text":"Delicious and family owned! The place is the perfect balance between fast food and sit down. Delicious food, great prices, they even have liquor selections on their menu. I had the Carne Asada soft tacos they were juicy, and perfectly cooked. I got mine with a side of Guacamole which was fresh. They also have Horchata, and Jaimacia to drink like any sit down Mexican place would. The owners and staff are very nice too. It's an amazing place for authentic and fast Mexican food for lunch."}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite place for great chicken enchiladas. That's what I get and they are the best I have ever eaten. The salsa is also very good and made daily. Just doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Daniels Mexican food is exactly what we needed in surprise! Fresh, tasty, and very friendly staff! I recommend their carne asada it's my fav!"}
{"text":"Great hospitality, big portions at little prices, and their flavor is off the charts. This the go to Mexican restaurant from now on, they are going to need a bigger place soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time tonight and really enjoyed the food. I got the chili Verde burrito which had just the right amount of spice. Husband had the ground beef taco which he loved and a beef burrito which he also enjoyed. We also ordered a carne asada quesadilla for our son, the steak was tender but could have used a little more flavor. Overall a great experience. Everyone was very accommodating and friendly and allowed us to taste some of the food prior to ordering. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Welcome to Surprise Daniel!  Wow, we have needed a great, reasonable Mexican food restaurant and now we have it! 

I ordered the simple, beef taco and cheese enchiladas combo. It came with rice and beans. All of it was fresh, hot and extremely flavorful. (I was surprised the beef taco was ground beef, but it was still delicious.). Even the free chips and salsa were awesome.  Everything is made fresh, nothing from a can or pre-packaged.  Portions are large and the staff was very attentive and friendly. 

I can't wait to come back with the family and try their happy hour!  (2-6). My first visit left me loving this family owned and operated Mexican restaurant in Surprise."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Fresh, homemade goodness with a big helping of love!  Chile Relleno was amazing!"}
{"text":"Definently not \"authentic\" or original Mexican food. Was not impressed at all! Their carne asada is basically flank steak. It was not marinated or cut up . I was drawn by the good reviews so save yourself the time and go someone else unless you want American Mexican food."}
{"text":"My family recently moved to the area and I have been waiting to find \"my favorite Mexican restaurant.\"  I always use Yelp and the positive reviews on here for this restaurant are high so I figured I would give it a try.  My first disappointment was that there were no kids plates. My second disappointment was the pricing. It was very expensive for my two young daughters and I to eat there and we barely got any food.  Lastly, I thought the food was terrible. I strongly disliked everything I got. The salsa and the enchilada sauce did not taste good to me at all.  Ive never tasted Mexican food like that before. I will not go back there."}
{"text":"Great service good food. Did I mention great service? It was our first time there and even though we are here visiting, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good customer service and food. The enchilada was a little salty, but other than that taco and carne asada fries were all great!"}
{"text":"We've gone once. We liked it the one time we got to go. My husband and I work odd hours. There have been 2 times we've gone up to Daniels and it was closed. They are closed Mondays and close by 8pm other days. We normally eat dinner between 7 or 8pm so often Daniels is not an option, unless we want to eat quick. I understand they are a small biz and need to have time with their families. We hope sometime we get off work early enough to go again to Daniels. We really want to support small biz in Surprise because this town needs more small biz restaurants."}
{"text":"Staff very friendly and prompt to wait on us.  Our portions were generous and very filling ( had LARGE taco salads) we will return looking forward to trying their other menu items."}
{"text":"I tried this place today. Very disappointed. The food was very salty and way over-priced. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I purchased an on-line coupon for Daniel's Original Mexican Food.  I always check reviews before I buy and felt confident in the reviews.

The only restriction on the coupon was you must eat in and no to-go orders.  I placed my order(two Mexican platters), a beer and a margarita.  They immediately told me I couldn't use my coupon for alcoholic beverages, I asked them to point this out, this is when they explained it's a mistake and they've resolved this with the coupon company.  I asked for them to honor the coupon because when I purchased it the stipulation wasn't in effect, they refused and were very confrontational.   I don't know if the food is good or not (we left), the complimentary chips and salsa resembled tostitios chips and salsa (yuck).  I'll never return and I encourage others to stay away.

Upon departure we drove past Rio Mirage Café and decided to stop.  Take my advice, drive past Daniel's and stop there instead.

I called the coupon company his morning and got a refund"}
{"text":"This place has the best hard tacos in the northwest valley. Their happy hour is pretty good but the best deal is their daily beer specials 12 oz variety of domestic and imported beer just 1.25 each. The food is amazing I highly recommend Daniel's, a must if you're craving hard tacos made to order."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the price was horrible,  so for 4 tacos 2 burritos, and 2 drinks it was 43 dollars, they also stiff the burritos was allot of beans so you get less meat,  my wife ordered a burrito with only meat and cheese and it can or super tiny,  just want worth the price at all!"}
{"text":"So after coming here this is like restaurant style food in a fast food joint. It takes a little bit to get your food. They come out and bring you chips and salsa and silverware. I ordered a letter k burrito but had way more beams than green chili. The enchilada was ok. I was going to leave this place am4 stars until I tried my sons ground beef taco. Was very greasy I think the ground beef has been sitting in a vat of grease all day long. Might be back to try the chilireeno. Hate to give a new place a 3 in my home town. It's hard to get good new places. I think they are new and will figure out some new things to improve. I would try it has tons of stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"We tried Daniel's for the first time today. I have to say I think we've discovered a new favorite Mexican food restaurant! Everything was very fresh. The chips are freshly made and delicious, love the salsa and the guacamole was awesome. I'm somewhat picky when it comes to guacamole. My daughter got the chicken burrito. She loved it. I tasted the chicken and it was well seasoned and very flavorful on its own. My son had two beef tacos which he said were the best tacos he's had. The shells are freshly made, not sure if they're grilled or fried but they were amazing. My husband and I had the carnitas burrito. The meat was very good and it was topped with more yummy guacamole. We had a little sticker shock when we paid, it was $60 for all 4 meals, chips and guac and 4 drinks. This seems a little pricy for the atmosphere since it isn't a sit down restaurant. However my daughter says they support her media club at school and of course the food was delicious so we will be back. One note: because the food is freshly prepared everyone's food comes out at slightly different times. We didn't find it an issue but some people might. All the people who worked there were very nice and helpful too!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!
Our third try, we were able to experience Daniel's food. When we got there, they looked pretty stressed. The female was complaining how bad of a day it was and how busy it has been. I replied \"Well, that's a good thing then. You never want to be slow.\" I ordered the carne asada burrito. Wife had the two ground beef tacos. They were worried we might get upset because we would have to wait for about thirty minutes. Some people might get upset, we don't. We understand if you want fresh cooked food, it will take some time. Even when it might take a few minutes more. They offered us a free soda. 
1st) Very nice people, There was the cook, and young man, and the female cashier. Beside the females slightly being negative. They were all very nice. 
2nd) My burrito was worth trying! Glad we kept on coming back so we can try their food. Wife loved her taco's. 
3rd) The facility was very clean, I like how the kitchen is in the open and you can see them cook your food. They have nothing to hide from us!! We did not stay to eat there, however there are plenty of room. 
We will diffidently come back often, and try other items on the menu. 
Two reasons why I did not give a five star!
1) Chips were not the best, A little soggy, and greasy. 
2) The female cashier, I truly understand there are bad days. I honestly know when you are running out of things, you had a long day, you tend to be negative. Nothing against her! She was very nice. Hopefully you will realize the most important thing about running a place like this is be happy to see your customers."}
{"text":"Wish I would have found this little gem sooner! We arrived about 30 minutes before closing but they were very kind and said to have a seat and take our time. I got 2 chicken enchiladas and a beef taco, hubby got a \"junior log\" burrito and it was huge!! And DELICIOUS!! 
The tres leches cake is home made and brought in fresh. This place is soooo good especially if you don't want to spend $50+ on dinner for 2 adults and a teenager at Rio Mirage!!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure what everyone sees and tastes. We went in and all five of us said \"what's so special\". Pretty sure this won't be around for very long. Don't waste your time. 
I ordered the tostada and it looked like someone vomited on my plate. There was no corn tostada in sight. It was chips on a plate with a ton of stuff on top. Took about ten bites. That was enough for me. It was falling off the plate. Terrible. My friends had the enchilada plate and they all said they were mediocre. Tasted like a frozen meal. Very disappointing. Won't be getting our business again. 

I do have to say the workers were friendly though."}
{"text":"Took my wife and 4 kids to this place tonight. Food was very good..and the service was even better. My kids like buttered hot tortillas. When I ordered 2 buttered tortillas, the cashier said that they did not have butter. I told him that a hot tortilla without butter would be fine. When they brought us our food, the owner brought us a cube of butter and said he just went and picked it up at Sprouts. How impressive is that? I have been waiting for a food Mexican food place to come to Surprise for a while now. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a strip mall in Surprise, Daniel's Original Mexican Food Restaurant has a non-descript exterior and generic interior. They opened in 2015, so perhaps more permanent signage will be placed to beckon customers inside. Right now, there is a vinyl banner hanging on one side of the building, which means you might drive by and not notice it if you are coming from Litchfield Road. The front door stencil is bright and colorful, so you will likely see it if you walk.

Once inside, you order your food from the counter. They take all credit cards and even use the EMV chip reader. You can help yourself to the soda station and sit wherever you like. The afternoon sun is intense, so the tables next to the window will likely be empty.

I ordered food for take out. They gave me an approximate time of 20-30 minutes which was spot on. Two large paper bags were presented to me. I was told to keep one standing verticle and the other horizontal to prevent spills.

FYI, the a la carte menu items are LARGE servings. My mom ordered carnitas tacos, which consisted of moist and meaty chunks of slighty salty pork topped with a dollup of guacamole and wrapped in two, 8 inch flour tortillas. The server on the phone suggested she order 2, but my mom who eats like a bird, could only eat half of one. These are not small, dollar tacos you get at most food trucks in the area. She also ordered a side of refried beans from the a la carte menu which ended up being a 9-inch pie tin swimming in beans. Who is this a side order for...a party of 10?

In addition to the carnitas tacos, we both had chile rellanos. Neither had the stem. They had been prepared into a neat, flat,  square shape that was packed with melted cheese. My rellano was part of the #4 combo which also included a cheese enchilada with a side of refried beans.

The salsa and the red sauce poured ontop of the chili rellanos and enchilades all had a distinctive smokey, chili powder flavor. It wasn't spicy at all. Neither my mom nor I were very fond of it. It was okay, but somewhat over played since it was a common flavor in all of the dishes.

With so many Mexican restaurants in the area, I probably wouldn't return. However, if you do go, you definitely won't leave hungry considering their portion sizes."}
{"text":"lets be honest not a whole lot of options in surprise az. for good mexican food.Well daniels has nailed it....i work in the same plaza and i enjoy lunch from daniels at least twice a week. Great owners family owned and operrated tasty fresh food great price imo."}
{"text":"This place is great! Customer service is excellent, food is delicious and fresh! Staff was very friendly, checked on how the food was and cleared our plates when we were finished. New favorite mexican food restaurant! And they have only been open for 5 months! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! A little pricy but the food was really great! Definitely will be back. I like how it's family owned definitely original. I had a carne Asada taco and you can tell the difference in meat from when you go to a filibertos."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food that I tried today. Carne asade taco, and chicken taco. The steak was not greasy or fatty. The marinade flavor was very good. The soft chicken taco (recommended to make the soft crispy) was great as well. The owner/cook explained to me that everything is made from scratch and cooked that day. He did not disappoint.

I've lived in surprise for 8 years. This is the first new place out here that has opened that I am impressed with for both quality and price!"}
{"text":"The place is very clean and staff is friendly. However, I was hoping to finally have found authentic Mexican food in Surprise, but was disappointed. The food is good but nothing too great especially for the price."}
{"text":"I was impressed by the customer service here as well as the food. I've been there twice now and everything I and my family have had has been really good.The tacos are freshly fried and not too greasy, the green chile is awesome and so is the salsa. The chips aren't that great, but the burritos are almost the size of your plate so it makes up for it! Overall good for what I believe is a family owned strip mall joint. You can see into the kitchen and everything was spotless. It is a bit pricey but you get a lot of food and the chips and salsa are free."}
{"text":"This place is really good!  Their chips and salsa are delicious.  Love the shredded beef tacos.  I highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner and we loved our food.  We got take out instead of staying there to eat.  Friendly and welcoming, our food was ready in no time, and the price was well worth the portions we got.  We will be going there again!"}
{"text":"Excellent enchiladas...green chile on point!  This place is legit! Best carnitas tacos in AZ! & I'm Mexican...I know."}
{"text":"My husband purchased a coupon on line for this place.  It was really great deal  and we were excited to get there and try it out,  before we purchased coupon we checked their reviews as well . When we arrived I was really disappointed when I saw the place but we kept to be optimistic . We went inside,there is no waiter - you have to order your food at the counter - like fast food restaurant - we ordered 2 main dishes , margarita and beer.  When it came to paying suddenly the young guy who took our order stated he cannot accept the coupon for our drinks, my husband told him there is no restrictions about drinks in the offer.  The only restriction there is - you can not use it for take out.  Young gentleman did not stop to argue with us.  We asked to see manager . She came and she stated that coupon was adjusted and she can't accept it for drinks.  My husband told her we bought it 3 weeks ago and if they adjusted in between its not our fault.  She stated we can order food only and take it out!!!  We mentioned to her that take out is the only restriction ! She was not listening and blaming the person who put the offer on local flavor for the mistake and she was not willing to accept responsibility. She left our table stating again we can buy food and take it out . There was no apology statement from her , she never tried to deescalate and win us as her customers.  I felt like she don't care at all about us . She was rude and confrontational.  My husband checked the website again. He confirmed we are right but then he stated: even if she now admit her mistake and decide to accept our coupon I don't want to be in this place anymore.  We left . This place is absolutely horrible. If you are looking for nice lunch or dinner ambience you will not find it here.  Looks like McDonald,  if you don't know that this place is serving food , you would never guess - so bad it looks from outside.  Very rude service incl a person who claim to be owner ( ! )  
I will never again go there and I do not recommend to anybody this place nor their service!!   Nearby there is awesome Mexican place. Don't waste your money at Daniels.
We are buying coupons and offers on line all the time - it allow us to discover some great places  - we had never before experience such service."}
{"text":"Nice, little one-off kind of place. Delicious, fresh made carne asada burrito with complimentary chips and salsa. Make sure to try the \"extra hot\" salsa, if you think you have what it takes. YEE HAW !"}
{"text":"Always looking for great mexican food! One of my favorites. Went to Daniel's Mexican Food and had the nacho supreme by itself, no drink combo meal. $11.00 with tax. I almost changed my mind right then and there. It wasn't that great or large for $11.00  Next time I'll probably go to another sit down restaurant for those prices."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Soooo good!!! Been there several times and food is good every time....excellent customer service....very polite employees....good salsa....two taquitos and guac were more than enough to fill me up...I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in and I had their \"taco salad\" today. Kind of disappointing. There was no kind of taco shell or tortilla chips that you would assume with it being a taco salad. Would've been so much better if it had been served over a bed of tortilla chips. Judging from the photos uploaded on Yelp, the salad was literally the same garnish they put with their burritos and enchiladas but with a very small scoop of guacamole and sour cream. Their red salsa was pretty good, green salsa lacked serious flavor. Three stars because they seem like real genuinely nice people. I will probably be back again, probably won't ever order the taco salad again until they change that recipe."}
{"text":"Best we have had in the west valley!!! Easy 5 stars! Service was great, not a long wait and food was incredible!!! Only thing is they close way to early. I cant count the number of times I have wanted to stop in between 8p-10p."}
{"text":"You have to know where you are going to find this place. Located in a terrible location on the end of a strip mall, and behind a gas station. It used to be Mike's, but he couldn't survive the poor real estate. Fortunately the food is worth the hunt. 
I visited on a Friday night, and the place was busy. It's a little Mom and Pop restaurant, so more than a few people is busy for them. I tried the chicken burrito which was large and very tasty.  This is restaurant quality food, on real plates, at fast food prices. I have read some reviews claiming high prices, but I think I paid about $6.95 for a chicken burrito enchilada style, which is about what I would pay at Filibertos. Daniels also includes fresh chips and salsa with your order.
The staff was all very friendly, and the service is good. The only thing I would caution people about is that if you go during a busy time, you may be waiting awhile, because it's a little place, with a small staff, making each dish when ordered.
I do wish they had some more chicken and/ or fish dishes, most of the entries are beef."}
{"text":"Ima be real with you all. I've been in a love/hate relationship with Filbertos on and off for the past ten years or so. They've given me good times but the older I get the more I realize that their giraffe/dog meat tacos are a guaranteed emergency bathroom trip.
Daniels is a breath of fresh air. It's like going out with a nice guy after ten years with no job and no car. I'm a solid 93% sure it's real meat and it tastes all sorts of delicious. I'm sorry Filbertos but Daniels has given me the emotional strength to leave you and never look back. You can keep the dog and the silverware, I'll keep my dignity and start eating here instead.

(All jokes aside this place is delicious and my food actually looks like food, not to mention that it's for a good price too)"}
{"text":"We stopped in and got nachos and a chicken burrito to split. The sauce on the burrito was a salty, tasted like canned, enchilada sauce. The chicken was dry and not at all flavorful. The nachos were okay. There are better places in the immediate area for Mexican. Maybe some of their other food is better but we were less than impressed."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, great value, great service.  I told the guy I was vegetarian and he suggested the cheese quesadilla with the chilis in it.  Very good!  Makes me wish I lived in AZ."}
{"text":"We were here today for the first time.  We arrived for lunch at the 11 a.m. opening time.  Coming from San Diego,  I know good Mexican food.   This is really, really good.   Freshly made, quality Mexican food is what they serve here.  Our waitress,  Nomi, was wonderful.   I have found my \"go to\" spot whenever I'm craving a good taco or burrito.   Also, I'm picky about beans, but these are obviously freshly made and delicious.   The chips and salsa are also made freshly, and top notch.  Bottom line is, I love this place."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, I really do but a ground beef burrito with no flavor at all, just plain ground beef wrapped in a flour tortilla is NOT what I call Mexican food. Shredded beef isn't even an option. I won't be back. I also felt it was over priced. Just my opinion.  I wish I could give them high marks, but I just can't."}
