{"text":"Lovely friendly staff. Super spacious and full of light. Outlets everywhere. Got a free drink with purchase of beans. The mocha came in a bowl and was really good to the last drop. Around closing I was offered a free scone, I gladly took a savory one and wow! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I recently used this venue for a book reading event held by a non-profit organization I'm part of.  The venue was beautiful and perfect for the event.  The staff was very friendly and accomodating and Jenny Creed was very helpful and easy to interact with to setup our booking.  I would definitely go back there again! Thanks Creeds!"}
{"text":"The food here is much too expensive for what it is, and there are no prices on anything. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Great coffee spot! Great coffee and other options. The eggy scones are a must-try, a personal favourite. Lots of space to work or read and enjoy your coffee. Bright and open space. A good spot for a meet-up because of the open space (e.g. client, vendor, etc.)"}
{"text":"I'm slightly particular when it comes to coffee, I feel a lot of places the beans taste burnt or the baristas are there to look good for one another. I tried the salted caramel scone and it was a dream. There was a super cute video of winking chihuahuas playing while I was there which was a good visual break from my comp. It's a nice space."}
{"text":"The place packed during the noon hour. I like the sandwiches and salads that they have there. The only thing that needs to change is the espresso. The stronger the espresso beans are, the more burnt the taste gets. I don't wanna have this burnt taste every week. There's flowers on every table. It's a bit pricey over here. I go there every Wednesday after my guitar class on Manning Avenue. This is my go to place for coffee."}
{"text":"Creeds serves great coffee in a great space (really interest digital art!) However the one thing that it's lacking is a menu with prices.  I'd like to know how much things cost before I decide to buy - case in point: I purchased a delicious tuna wrap, but with tax it came to $11.  It was delicious, but I wouldn't say it's worth the $11 price tag.  Other than the lack of menu, the staff are nice, the coffee is amazing and there's tons of tables and outlets to work at!"}
{"text":"Coffee Beyond.... Atmosphere Tres Cool.....and Warm Kale Salad,Tai Rolls,Scones....Tuna Wrap and more ... Unreal ......Relax and Work Rent the Venue Just Go..........."}
{"text":"I came to get some school work done and loved the environment. I ordered the chai latte and it's pretty much the standard cup. I recommend coming to study when you need it"}
{"text":"The coffee here is fantastic. I find the food quality to be average but super over priced so I can't recommend the food/snacks there.  The drinks (specially the espresso based ones) are one of the best in town. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's been a caffeine-fueled fall and having Creeds nearby has been a godsend.  Good coffee; tasty prepared food (pricey, but quality); and a modern and comfortable space with a calm energy.   A relaxing office away from the office or place to grab something good on the go. Plus they'll dry-clean your clothing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! A dry cleaner. Yoga studio. Work place and cafe in one!  The almond milk latte was delicious. Also highly recommend the scones. Especially the goat cheese and tomato version.   Staff are super friendly and polite. There are newspapers if you dine in to read at your leisure and plenty of space to work."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place a million times without realizing it was a cafe/bar. It doesn't have the outside appearance of one, but it's great. Full service bar, cafe, and seating area. You can rent the space out for parties/events. The staff is nice, young and good looking. It's especially great because Dupont and Spadina is becoming a hipper area but still is lacking a good cafe/non-bar-feeling bar."}
{"text":"I walked to Creeds cafe. I was welcomed by the barista (very nice guy). I asked for a single espresso, Barista replied back they only serve double shot espresso!!! Which was Disappointing! Not my place!"}
{"text":"actually was there the day it opened.....LOVED this place. Beautifully decorated and the coffee was excellent - I'm a bit of a coffee snob so.....best part is? Drop your dry cleaning off, grab a coffee - great spot."}
{"text":"A perfect latte every time!! Nice inviting space.  Wish the flat screens had more interesting viewing."}
{"text":"This place is very unique, very large loft-like space where you can come and work or study in peace. Interesting interior with modern wooden tables and chairs. Coffee is great, I tried a latte with almond milk and it was creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"Cutest little coffee shop I stumbled on.  All the products they offer are quality and you taste it.   The decor is very modern.  I ordered the chicken wrap, smoked salmon sandwich and goat cheese scone. Lemon ginger tea and peppermint tea  Everything tasted good but what stood out the most was the goat cheese scone  the cheese was sooo rich flavor overload"}
{"text":"Not worth the price. $14 for a coffee and muffin. Wasn't worth it. Felt like a complete gouge riding on the former lux glory of the Creeds name."}
{"text":"First time here. Got London Fog, I liked it! Busy here but quiet. Hope can have price on the menu."}
{"text":"Loved the abundance of space and tables to work in this cafe. Not to mention the rarity in a cafe that offered free parking!   The barista was super friendly. Ordered the:  Cappuccino $4.25 - Excellent! It wasn't overly milky and it tasted smooth going down. Most importantly no disgusting after taste.   Flat White $4.75 (Around that price) - Again, it was pretty good. Lovely crema, good milk to coffee consistency, and not to mention a cute latte art to top it off.  Note not to get too captivated by the weird art videos played in the cafe...caught myself wasting a good 4 minutes watching it.  The only drawback is that there is no price listed on the menu, but everything else was excellent."}
{"text":"First off, let me just marvel out how beautiful the interior of this cafe is. It's seriously so nice. It is a very welcoming environment with lots of natural light and the perfect place to study or catch up on work. The staff have always been very friendly and you don't feel rushed to vacate the table after 30 mins. I really enjoy their cappuccino, they get the foam just right (not too watery, not too foamy). I also find it charming that they serve their iced drinks in mason jars, a very cute and homely touch go this otherwise upscale cafe. I wish the pastries were fresher, but the spotlight is on their espresso and it's great. Nice ambience, good staff, amazing coffee."}
{"text":"I knew Creeds has great coffee. Discovered their salted caramel scone today... OMG heaven in a baked good!!! Totally worth the $30 parking ticket I got while running into the cafe."}
{"text":"Definitely a pricey coffee spot.  However, lovely vibe, very spacious, comfortable seatings, and absolutely killer scones. Every flavor is amazingly delicious!!"}
{"text":"A spacious and a cozy place to beat the winter and summer blues. Sit and relax for hours over a cup of coffee or a ready to go wrap. The ambience is supercool and ideal for students looking to work on their group projects and assignments. Prices are affordable and my London Fog was great !"}
{"text":"Tastiest coffee in the 6..this is a one of a kind establishment that has coffee, laundry and dry cleaning. If you want a great place to do work, hangout, sip on some coffee then go here. I highly recommend the matcha tea...tasty tasty tasty!"}
{"text":"I would never have discovered this random cafe if it weren't for the Indie Coffee Passport! What a pleasant surprise. This cafe looks like a fancy dry cleaners from the outside (which it is, the cleaner service is at the back) with it's black and white sign. But inside, it's airy and spacious, with lots of character from art work on the walls and funky home-y furniture. I am partial to the big brown leather chairs. There are large tables to spread out and do work, and more cozy nooks as well.   The barista when I went was super friendly and chatty with my friend and I. I got a chai latte and he explained the different kinds they have. I went for the fresh chai, which has a fragrant spiciness to it, like legit Indian chai. They also serve kombucha on tap, which my friend tried and liked. The barista really knew his tea and coffee drinks, explaining how kombucha is made and the ins and outs of matcha among other things.   They have a good selection of food. In addition to cookies and scones, they offer things like kale salads and wraps (pre-wrapped, so not made fresh to order, but good if you're in a hurry!).   A great neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"New coffee place in Bayview Ave just South of Eglinton Ave. Pretty spacious and some cool decor. Had a Cortado which was great. There are lots of snacks to choose from, some merch to purchase and just overall good place to hangout.   For now it's good, I'll probably revisit this review with a few more visits, especially during summer."}
{"text":"Really like the decor here! Spacious with lots of seats to chill, and their wifi is super fast!   Their latte is great as well :)."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible and overpriced coffee. They use pilot beans but they don't do it justice. Got iced latte. They also pour the espresso shot into the milk rather than espresso shot first into the ice and then add milk. So it makes the whole thing lukewarm. Not ideal.   They provide pc brand honey and granular sugar. No simple syrup. In the ice drinks granular sugar and honey doesn't dissolve well.   Iced latte and Americano was almost 10. Which is a bit pricey too. Hard pass."}
{"text":"Well decorated place. Lots of natural light. It is spacious with a good amount of seating. There also seems to be dry cleaning at this place. The staff are friendly. The menu is fairly simple. It's a nice place to sip on your coffee and do some work (not as commercial as starbucks). The cold brew is decent and quite strong. The scones at this place are apparently very popular (when I arrived they were sold out). Overall it was a pleasant experience (not too busy at all with a mellow vibe)."}
{"text":"A really cute and cozy café that's great for just chilling or getting some work done! The food and drinks there are also amazing! The café gives off really chill vibes and with free wifi it's a really great place to do some work in. The chairs are also really comfy!!!"}
{"text":"I really love the space here. It's warm, spacious and has cool seating options. Though they sell amazing coffee, if you are not feeling like having a kick of caffeine, they also offer liquor and an array of other drink options. The staff is also friendly, passionate and will leave you alone to sip away in peace. Always a plus! The outside though is deceiving...it almost looks like a furniture shop from the outside - with parking! How often do you fins that in downtown Toronto?!"}
{"text":"For anyone who is looking an amazing place to set up your laptop to work, I would highly recommend this spot.  I think my mouth dropped on seeing how large and nice this space is.  I wasn't ever expecting this from Toronto ever.  Another huge plus... they have a parking lot!!  The place has a lot of bright sun and tons of great seating where you can enjoy the a table to yourself without having people give you the evil eye cause everything is so cramped.  The tables are enough for partners to share and seats are very comfy. I love the natural wood details everywhere.  I was also loving the music as a background... it's happy and fun.  Think Carly Rae Jepsen (but her newest album ... underrated Queen IMO), Halsey, or Dua Lipa.   The bar here has a lot of choice between your typical espresso drinks to beer, cider to kombucha.  Another nice touch is they have 3 types of milk so you dont have to worry about your lactose intolerance.  Flat White with almond milk - The barista here puts care into each one and you can see the really nice clean design as you pick up your drink.  The espresso here is a bit more bitter than other places and I think skews a bit more towards the espresso.  Its a bit unbalanced but if you find it too strong, you could add a touch of sugar to temper it.  3.5/5  Iced Chai Latte - unfortunately the chai was very weak in flavour. We tasted more water and milk instead of any spice.  We had to add cinnamon to give it some flavour.  2/5  Mochacinno - They use their own chocolate blend (or mixture) and you can definitely taste the chocolate.  It was interesting as it was a dark chocolate note ... bordering on chalkiness.  A touch too bitter perhaps.  The balance of milk to espresso was much better in this one.  3/5  Overall, I think this is an excellent place to work and seeing how they're just reinvigorating the area with new condos, I can see this being a popular place in the future."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, layout and ambiance.  Lots of seating, parking and lighting.  The service is impeccable, friendly, attentive, quick to clean up and help.  The espresso and cortado were decent."}
{"text":"Creed is an instagram/Pinterest worthy coffee shop with dry cleaners at the back! Definitely an odd hybrid. But hey, whatever works!   Great offerings from producers in Toronto. I had mocha and Baker and Scone cheddar dill scone ($4). Although my scone was cold in the middle, the staff at Creed heated it up for me. Mocha was complimentary as I filled out the survey after connecting to the WiFi.  Overall, super cute location. Friendly staff. Great service. I just wish they would switch out the black plastic coffee cap!   Can't wait to come back when the weather is warmer to try their pop stand!  Pro Tip: log onto WiFi, fill out survey via text, and get a cup of complimentary coffee of your choice!"}
{"text":"Very Overpriced! If you thought Starbucks was expensive, you haven't seen anything yet! NOT WORTH IT! STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"If you are someone that doesn't care about your surroundings and the food quality/price ratio is more important, you should avoid this place. Overpriced offerings of mediocre quality. $15 for cold sandwiches/snacks that are provided by Foodbenders (ie, not made on site). Very disappointing and pales compared to other places in the neighbourhood. Rapido is better food on Bathurst at a similar price point and Chadwick's actually costs less for smaller bites."}
{"text":"Creeds is a fairly new addition to the Leaside area. I dropped in to grab a drink and got tempted by the Roasted Tomato and Goat Cheese Scone ($7.50) which actually is sourced from Baker & Scone. The scone was heated before it was brought out to me and was quite good. Although the scone itself was a little denser and more bready than I prefer, there was a very nice herby flavour; and biting into it, you can see all the beautiful layers built in. But what made the scone stand out was the layer of goat cheese and toasted tomatoes on top. The tart, earthy flavour of the goat cheese mixed incredibly well with the herbs in the scone and the roasted tomato added an amazing pop of concentrated savoury sweetness which was both light and refreshing when contrasted with the goat cheese. The warmed goat cheese also added a wonderful velvety and creamy texture to the scone.  For a drink I got a chai latte ($5.25) and although it was beautifully presented, the latte was watery, weak in flavour and lacking in texture. There was a good amount of cinnamon on top to help decorate the drink but it was not enough to redeem the latte.  Unlike the Dupont location, I did see a small price list for the drinks sitting on the counter and the scones were all priced with little signs so you know how much you'll be paying before you order. The space is very nice and quite instagrammable. Large and airy, there's lots of character with signs bearing interesting facts hung on the walls and tvs airing funky artsy clips. Prices are a little higher here but there's free wifi, great service and lots of places to work. Definitely worth a peek in if in the area."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I've worked with the fine folks at Creeds on an evening event before, when they transform into, well, whatever you want them to be. But, I've been back recently to work in their beautiful coffee shop, and I wanted to share my experience.  Incredibly friendly staff, great lattes, kombucha on tap (what!) and beautiful communal and personal tables. If you're a remote employee or wear dem freelance pants, this is definitely a spot you should become acquainted with."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Yes it's overpriced, but it's a fabulous place to get some work done. They even have board games for when you want to take a break! The place is incredibly spacious and has couches, chairs, stools - the options are endless. There are outlets everywhere and the Internet is reliable.  It's always tough to find a great place to study, where you don't have to lurk around awkwardly waiting for someone to leave. On top of that, their staff are very friendly.   The only reason Creeds isn't getting 5 stars is because of the pricing. Other than that, this place is definitely a life-saver !"}
