{"text":"the woman who took my to-go order was pleasant,  but the sandwhich was terrible. i ordered whatever their trademark sandwich was, basically an imitation big mac... and the meat was tiny and over cooked. they make better sandwiches at fast food joints. and so that's exactly what i did... went down the street Sonic for a real burger."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Eat N Park's salad and soup bar, but not the Streetsboro one. This is one hot mess of a restaurant. The broccoli soup seldom has broccoli, and the potato soup seldom has potatoes. Both are usually brown instead of cream colored. The servers are just useless. They usually go back behind that divider where you can't see them or try to catch their eye if you need something. I quit going here, very disappointing."}
{"text":"A good sized restaurant that has a very good breakfast and salad bar.  This place has always been clean and neat, especially the bathrooms.  The service by the waitstaff has been perfect and the manager listens to all issues.  The hostess/host has a lot to be desired, but please don't hold that against the rest of the staff.  I recommend breakfast over lunch or dinner here, but otherwise, I have no complaints."}
