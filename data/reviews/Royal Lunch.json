{"text":"Great food at a more than reasonable price. With the exception of one waitress, the service is always friendly and fast.  The waitresses are very attentive and keep your coffee cup filled. Love the corned beef hash omelet.  The home fries are excellent."}
{"text":"A diner next to a car wash you say?! With affordable delicious food?! We definitely have to go!

This place is so unexpected and that is why there must be only a few reviews for it because this place is has great food for the best price around! I came here on a Saturday around 11am and had a good experience. The server was nice and fast and my bill with tax was $5.38! I ordered the eggs benedict and the eggs were cooked the way a poached egg should be cooked! My sister ordered the Polish Polka omelette and that was magnificent. I mean who doesn't love an omelette stuffed with mashed potatoes and topped with a heaping amount of melted cheese?!

For all you diner lovers, you need to add this to your list!"}
{"text":"Was a regular, once a week. Today we went and again, as stated before, the service was awful. However, today we found not one, but TWO pieces of hair in our food. When I told the waitress she grabbed our checks and said she gave us 50% off (after I stated several times I wasn't looking for money off, just wearing her of the issue). When I got home I realized they did not give us a discount at all. My meal was $4.50 (maybe $4.99, either way) and I was told kids eat free with purchase of drink. Well after we got our \"discount\" my check was still $4.44. Sadly, I will not be returning. Not because of the lack of a discount, like I said, I wasn't interested in one, but because the service is so awful, waitresses are beyond rude, and there were 2 pieces of hair in my food and it was treated as though it was my fault."}
{"text":"I would have never stopped here without my friend recommending the Polish omelet.  This cozy diner blends right in next to a car wash it shares its building with.  While the Polish omelet (stuffed with mashed potatoes and topped with a ton of cheese) was awesome the buttered toast was ridiculously buttered to the point I was trying to wipe it off with my napkin and the side of hash browns that came with the meal were so greasy I couldn't eat more than that first bite.  The service was nice and friendly and the prices are nice and low."}
{"text":"The food is good. However, the waitresses (as another reviewer mentioned) are always short-tempered and grumpy. If you like small diners, it is worth a try...but do not expect to be greeted with a smile. They are only open till 3pm and are usually pretty busy during the weekend. Worth a try if you can be patient and don't have high service expectations!"}
{"text":"Great diner experience. Big portions great tasting food and very friendly people we each had the pastrami and swiss omelette. I order mine with extra pastrami (which I was not charged for) the cheese just oozed put when you cut into it.   Mmm cheesy goodness we highly recommend"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience down the street at \"Mom's\" my family and I decided to come here and were served very quickly! The staff was pleasant and food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Really good, inexpensive food. Small, quaint mom and pop type of place. Wish I had something like this near me"}
{"text":"Always Breakfast time ! Open early in the morning but close to early for dinner. Food is cooked well and  coffee is always fresh! Waitresses  are always friendly! I've heard some people say waitress grumpy, I go there alot and have never had that issue. Not alot of room and usually crowed for breakfast. But turn over is fast."}
{"text":"Excellent local place for a hearty breakfast. Service is quick. A variety of daily specials starting at $4.99. You won't go away hungry.  Causal, seat yourself. The only drawback is the noise level."}
{"text":"I love coming to Royal Lunch for breakfast, it's one North Royalton's gems. I love getting the skillet with the bacon and sausage, they do charge $1 for every vegetable added. It can get a little pricey but the portions are large. It's a great place for anybody who wants good breakfast, but the space is small so they do have a hard time accommodating large groups."}
{"text":"Good diner breakfast.I had the country fried steak and eggs which was great.The hash brown were crispy golden brown and couldn't beat price of just under 8$."}
{"text":"Not closed... however I bet the staff wish it was. My waitress was grumpy and before I even sat down she said she would not be there for long. The sitting was tight and i believe they only have a total of 12 tables.  the food was pretty good.  the corned beef omelet was tasty and the hash browns were some of the best i have had in this area.

now only if they can get their head out of their ass and know that the online reputation is shot .  the last entry was that it was closed.  when i brought it to their attention it was almost as though they had never seen a smartphone.  

so A on the food and a D on the service."}
{"text":"take a good look when you search for \"breakfast\" in \"north royalton\"...you will discover there is no place like home....the south suburbs are a waste land when it comes to decent diners, breakfast foods, cafes, coffee shops and fine dining....there simply aren't any and the few places you have are weird and quirky........so, eat at home until this regions wakes from its slumber or get in that Mickey D's line and gobble down that Mcmuffin"}
{"text":"For the decor I would have to say that the prices should be lower. But the food was really good (I got the breakfast croissant, my sister got the 3 egg special, my mom got the slam, and my other sister got the 2 egg special) but for such a small place where quick turnover is ideal it seemed a bit pricy and the server was a little disgruntled."}
{"text":"If you've never had a really good breakfast in your grandma's basement, then come here.

Food was really good; wife has the french toast and she said it was the best she's had in awhile. I got a veggie omelette; first, the omelette is huge, I've got a dad bod and I couldn't handle it. The potatoes are perfectly crusted. My omelette had all fresh veggies too, none of that older hogwash junk.

Good service, very quick, well priced - do recommend."}
