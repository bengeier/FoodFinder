{"text":"In all of Phoenix, this is my favorite over all Indian place. We try to go there once a month since we live in the East Valley so its about a 45 minute drive. But when we get there, we have amazing food.
Our favorite are the Tandoori Chops and the Lamb Boti Masala w/ Garlic Nan. The Tandoori Chops are to die for and I haven't had better ones yet. 
Simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food!  Beef biriyani, naan, goat curry, eggplant bhurta, butter chicken, paneer pakora. I will go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to this area from the east valley where we were near the best indian restaurant in the valley in Guru Palace at Baseline and gilbert rd.  This was some of the worst indian food I've ever had, and this is in no way to demean the amazing meal I had there but I have had better indian food at Taste of India in Fargo North Dakota. We got take out so I can't speak to the atmosphere but when I walked in there was one other person there and the owners. The Garlic Naan was more like pita bread it didn't feel or taste like it was cooked in a tandoor and was thick. I would say they bought it somewhere and just reheated. My wife got the staple-Chicken Tikka Masala...I make better chicken tikka masala. The jew from ny makes better chicken tikka masala then Tandoori Village. There were 8 count them 8 chunks of chicken and a sauce that was filled with whole spices and the wrong kind of chunky. No Onions, no peppers just bits of bay leaf and whole cardamom pods. It was pretty gross. I ordered the Tandoori Lamb chops as I'm a lamb lover and thought this would be a good thing to try since I don't see it on too many menus. My $14 dish was 3 skinny chops and one massive...I don't what kind of portion that is but it's not a $14 dish portion. This was our first and only time being a patron of tandoori village. I can't wait to try tandoori times as it's closer and has to be a vast improvement on this awful meal."}
{"text":"I really liked this place ...sadly the other day I stopped by they are closed."}
{"text":"The palak paneer alone is worth trying this place out.  Although there are other good items on the menu, I usually go with my favorite.  It is totally addictive!

Quite frankly, I don't understand why there are such bad reviews here on Yelp.  I've usually had good experiences here, as opposed to Tandoori Times 2, which I found disappointing.  Most of the staff is nice to me.   Julia, the young waitress from Ukraine, was especially nice and always did a good job.  Service is usually good, although a few times there have been two annoying yappy teenage servers with attitudes.  (They don't work there anymore!) 

I would definitely recommend Tandoori Village to any friend who wants to try Indian food.  The food is not exactly like the great Indian food I enjoyed in New Jersey and in Ottawa, but it is close enough!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Indian places I've been to.

When it comes to restaurants, I'm more of a food-over-service kind of girl. The service, decor and ambiance don't really matter to me so much as a good meal does.

This place is nothing to look at. I think it was a fried chicken shack before Tandoori Village took over it- and it still looks like it. The waiters are teenagers du jour and are acceptable, but you might have to flag one down to get your chai or water refilled. But like I said, that hardly matters when my 5-star review is all about the food.

To start, order hot chai. It will come unsweetened and very hot- but stir and stir with sugar while you wait for your meal. You'll find yourself strangely addicted to a second cup, even if you don't like whole milk (I detest it and this is the only time I drink it.)

The naan basket is fantastic- a variety of flavored naans, onion, garlic, potato. Also fantastic is the papadum- it's like a flat crispy cracker flavored with Indian spices. Try it with the two chutneys- the green one is mint and hot, the other is sweeter and earthier. Also try mixing them!

I love the palak paneer- a spinach dish made with Indian cheese- and the basmati rice. The vindaloo is also amazing. Their curries and \"sauce dishes\" will share a little easier than their tandoori or grilled dishes- get a variety of sauces and meats and trade around the table for a little sample of everything. I always leave a little high on spice and very satisfied. 

It's nothing special to look at, but it really depends on what you go in wanting. If you want a \"slice of India\" complete with belly-dancers and ornate carpets, you might want to try somewhere else. But for fantastic food at reasonable prices...this is your place!"}
{"text":"THE GOOD:

Good interior design. 

Located in a really prominent place. 

Quick service. 

THE BAD:

Some of the curries are really diluted and the quantities are served are less.
 
The Indian breads are not only overpriced but also taste worse off when compared to Tandoori Times 2 which is a nearby competitor. Times 2 also has my favorite bread, Chilli Naan, which I is not available here.

Amongst the appetizers, the Samosa is good but the aloo tikka is really bland and poorly cooked. 

Overall, I would suggest other local alternatives such as Tiffin India for takeaway and Tandoori Times 2 for dine in."}
{"text":"I find myself having a business lunch in a lame part of Phoenix AGAIN!

This time though, it's Indian food! Or make that....Pakistani food! Which is basically like....Indian food! Just with more meat!

Whatever the case, someone in my workgroup recommended this joint after our 1/2 day meeting and I was all amped to check it out since I spotted an ad for it in some paper last week but was bummed that it was so far from where I lived because I was never going to go there unless work took me there. 

And lo, the situation brought itself.

So six of us went in two cars and found ourselves at a former IHOP on Bell Rd & 43rd Avenue. Inside definitely still has the IHOP or a CoCo's vibe, except formica tables have been replaced by fake wood. 

The friendly waitress told me that they had just been open 12 days, and so she knew that six people meant six words of mouth spreading around town, with 3 out of the six knowing the food *very* well. We got aloo tikki (potato fritters with a side of garbanzos) and vegetable pakoras (our version of tempura, you could say) to start off with. I ordered the chicken biryani (a zesty rice dish with, uh, chicken), my boss got the same but with lamb, and my colleagues got the paneer tikka masala (cheese instead of chicken), chicken korma, tandoori chicken, and the chicken tikka masala lunch special (which came with rice, naan, and lentils for only $5.99). The naans were definitely better than the limp dishtowel-like ones at some other Valley establishments. Everyone, including myself, really enjoyed the meals, and our server was very attentive to anything we needed (again, they're still in \"first impressions\" phase). Two colleagues then wolfed down kheer (rice pudding) for dessert.

Random current Bollywood hits played throughout lunch and I looked around the place to see what could be better. I guess they have their work cut out for them to make the place more ethnic-looking since all those pastel floral lampshades yearn for Grandma Jolene. But my colleagues agreed the food was way better than Maharaja's down the street.

So, I continue to be the west Phoenix lunchtime warrior, since most of you will never set foot on that side of I-17. Which is fine.

More food for me...

----------------

Edited to dock 2 stars: Twice at lunch in the past month these guys have failed in a spectacular manner in getting my lunch order right, and each time the clueless non-Pakistani waitstaff would argue that *I* got my order wrong instead. Excuse me? WTF? I think I know what I ordered. If you can't handle the ethnic menu, work at Hometown Buffet instead. 

One time they gave my lunch to some other table that came in 10 minutes after I did but ordered the same thing, and so I ended up waiting for half an hour -- for my lunch. Another time I ordered the lunch special on their separate daily menu, which comes with naan, rice, and salad, and then they gave me the dish, without the side offerings, and then told me that my dish was never on the lunch special. Huh? I didn't just make up an order out of thin air, you had it on the daily menu that you gave me! Their answer? \"We can't find that daily menu you ordered from, so we can't give you the special.\" Apparently they give out different lunch special menus on the same day, then accuse the customer of lying when he asks for all the accompaniments. The manager lady was pretty rude and not remotely sympathetic, and I was getting pissed and started raising hell. I eventually got the rice, and the naan (after they asked, \"Are you sure you want the naan? We'd have to make it from scratch.\" Of course I want the naan, Sherlock, what the hell is the lunch special for then? I sitll got no salad, of course.) On top of it all, no apologies. No offers to discount my meal. No nothing. 

Anyway, Tandoori Times is opening up their second restaurant closeby and I'll take my business there. As much as I want to support my peeps, when service becomes this atrocious, I don't care how good the food is anymore. Not going back again."}
{"text":"After living abroad for a few years, a favorite treat for my husband and I became Indian food. Once we moved back to Phoenix, I was determined to find a decent Indian restaurant.

After trying several disappointing restaurants throughout the city, I am pleased to say I found an excellent choice a few minutes from my house.

The restaurant is usually near empty when I've gone in for dinner. That worried me at first, but now I consider it an undiscovered gem. 

I was glad to see that a buffet was not offered because in my opinion, quality matters more than quantity.

My husband and I order the same dishes every time we dine here. My husband is Iraqi and a lot of Indian cuisine mirrors some of his favorites. Although he has tried a couple of different items in the past, we always orders Lamb Biryani and Naan. There is definitely no shortage of food here. We are stuffed silly by the time we leave.

My favotie dish to Chicken Tikka Masala with a (massive) side of rice. It doesn't get any better in my opinion.

The decor is plain and the staff isn't overly friendly. The service isn't impeccable but the food compensates for it."}
{"text":"I see folks dissing this place because it's 
in the shell of some old diner type place. No
shit, Sherlock. This wasn't formerly the Taj
Mahal but who gives a rat's derriere anyway?
I come here for the food. Once after eating
here I tried all the other Indian restaurants
in the neighborhood. They were just ok in 
comparison. A few have even gone out of business
since then. One of them that shares the first part
of the name had food so bland the only flavor
seemed to be salt. Even the rice it came with
was just plain - like it was minute rice or
something. And on top of that, they had a really
obnoxious belly dancer. What the heck is up with
that? A belly dancer? Isn't that like walking
into Lolo's and seeing freaking Riverdance being
performed? But back to the Village... Parking here 
is always easy - lots of space. Often times my 
group is the only group of people not of South 
Asian origin. That usually speaks to authenticity 
if you go for that sort of thing. Love their mint 
chutney dip for the papadams. The other dip that 
comes with them is too sweet - I usually leave it 
alone. They have a guy that's got a Tandoori oven 
and knows how to use it. Any of the Naans are always 
a sure thing. I'm a sucker for Vindaloo though. I've 
tried this same dish in multiple places in the general
vicinity - several square miles or so - and haven't 
found one that has just the right flavor like the 
way this place makes it. If you get bored while eating,
you can catch up with the latest Bollywood hits playing
on the TVs in the place. Don't forget to take a spoonful
of after dinner mint/fennel seeds combo to freshen your
breath before you leave."}
{"text":"Since I can't study right now, I might as well write the review of the restaurant that is to blame for my current state.  I took a dinner break and met a friend of mine at Tandoori Village.  I was thrilled, since I haven't had Indian food since moving to Arizona.  I still can't smell quite right, but even so, I could tell that this place smelled good.

Now, the other reviewers are right with one thing.  The place isn't much to look at.  But it's not a theme restaurant or some fancy-pants hipster fusion restaurant, so I'm not gonna knock it for that.  They were playing Bollywood movies on the tv, and that was enough for me.

If you like nan, it's good enough here to make it worth the trip.  We had some potato, some onion, and some garlic nan.  I've never had garlic nan before.  It was one of the most garlic-y things I'd ever eaten.  Aside from the fact I'm gonna kill any vampires within a mile, it was fantastic.

The main dishes were all also good.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Curry dishes were delicious and had enough kick that it helped clear my head.  And the paneer was a wonderfully mild contrast between the two spicy dishes.  All the food was presented well (as well as Indian fod can, to be fair) and everything was clean.

For what we paid, we got a lot of food.  Even so, the late-evening food coma that's keeping me from studying may cause some grief later.  Ah well, at least it was for a good meal."}
{"text":"Great place for mainstream Indian curries! We love ordering take outs of butter chicken, lentils and veggie dishes. Food is fresh and place is run by a family so can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Only been here once, and once was enough. The place is absolutely crap. Not that I typically care about decor, but it was dingy as hell inside - in fact, your bog standard Denny's is like a Taj Mahal by comparison.

As others have commented, there was some ethnic fair-skinned girl on duty when we went. I know she was Ukrainian because the couple behind us picked up on the accent (which was almost too thick to understand) and asked her. Not exactly authentic, but then again that's something else I'm not typically concerned with.

What I am concerned with, however, is food quality - in particular places that skimp on stuff. I got a saag dish - can't remember what it was, probably beef or aloo - and it was completely drowned in the saag (pureed spinach). Wife got the butter chicken, same thing - 80% sauce, 20% meat. And the taste was just a-ight, nothing special at all which made it even more annoying. I could have cooked the same thing at home for a tenth the price.

During the course of the meal, I noticed something which looked like a black beetle with its innards spilling out. I've seen plenty of cardamom seeds in my time, but the ones I'm used to are khaki-ish-greenish in colour and a lot smaller than this was. I called Ms Ukraine over and asked her what it was. She - get this - gave me a scared expression and said in her halting English \"I.. not know! don't eat it!!\" then scurried off. Don't eat it?! I had a sniff of the seed and it was definitely a cardamom - evidently a Giant Black North American Cardamom. Frankly, looking at the place I wouldn't have been surprised if it -was- a beetle.

Never going back. I wouldn't have even if the server HADN'T have advised me not to eat the food. Best Indian on the west side remains Tandoori Times II on NE cnr 57th and W Bell, and even that's a far cry from what I've had in Sydney and San Fran. I second Mr K.'s observation - avoid this place."}
{"text":"This was hands down the best Indian food I have had to date. I had sort of given up on Indian food with most of the restaurants in the Seattle area going to a lunch buffet which is just luke warm gross food like every other buffet I have tried. 

I didn't want to spend a lot of money and most of their food is $10 and above so I got the $7 Tandoori Chicken wrap. Sweet mother of Ganesha this was amazing! Tandoori Chicken, vegetables and spices in a very hot very fresh Naan wrap. 

The service was polite and prompt. The place seems to be mostly frequented by the local Indian populations (we were the only non-Indian people in there). 

Being a family restaurant, expect to have kids all around you, being kids.   

On a side note and I am not sure if this adds or subtracts from the over all authenticity of the experience but the smell coming out of my ass today is like a Mumbai slum! (so I hear) Woooooo Weeeeee........"}
{"text":"Worst place you can visit in your life. 
Went with my co-workers. They served rotten ghulab-jaban.
Everything tastes bad."}
{"text":"Yeah. terrible service. atrocious decor. but dang. the food is pretty good. a cool thing is that the last time i dined here, they gave us extra naan on the house. sweet. 

if you decide to visit this location, expect slow service. and yeah, the teenage waitress has a little bit of attitude. but the food is still good!"}
{"text":"Okay, the place does not have the best atmosphere or decor .... but the food is pretty tasty and the prizes are reasonable. Good place to go for a casual, quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had. What the atmosphere lacks gets more than made up for in their quality of food. No complaints with this place. I'd come back in a heartbeat even if it's on the other side of town."}
{"text":"When I enter a south Asian - Indian or Pakistani restaurant for lunch I a really want a buffet. I got the coconut chicken curry which was really good. I did however upgrade the plain naan to a kheema naan , the naan itself was great but I found the kheema a bit salty and the next time I would recommend just to get the naan as it is . Other than that it was a good experience."}
{"text":"I still miss that chicken tikka masala because it contains very rich aroma flavor a that other Indian restraint don't have.  I don't know if the existing owner opened another Indian restaurant. If so please let me know! :)"}
{"text":"I loved food. My first time here. Great service. Fresh veggies. Fresh meat. Loved it. I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"One of the dirtiest places serving Indian Cuisine I've ever visited.  There were food crumbs everywhere on the floor.  The decor is from the 1970's, very worn down, and just not the sort of place that you want to visit... to eat.

Bread was alright, but food was bland.  Server pointed out the owner to me and this person was certainly not Indian.  Servers were caucasion kids (teens maybe?) and knew little about the food.

Insane prices considering everything else.  Not a great part of town either."}
