{"text":"Excellent Burgers! Flame broiled! The new place looks great. Friendly staff. They have a patio too!"}
{"text":"After a renovation, this place is trying to find its footing in what has been a sketchy area.  Tasty burger, handcut fries. But, when not busy, they got my toppings totally wrong.  Not taking credit cards? Big mistake for a restaurant.  Beer selection is dated. I was looking for something more interesting than Stella Artois.   Great patio out back."}
{"text":"Ordered their burger and fries and it was delicious. Great char on the burger and love that the fries were hand cut."}
{"text":"great lil jem at the corner of coxwell and Gerrard. the service and food was great, loved their fries, all handcut straight from the potato! the calamari and burgers were yummm! definitely will visit again!"}
{"text":"Really nice owners have recently remade this place into a welcome, casual environment and are clearly trying to offer quality, homemade products (including vegan burgers) at great prices to establish themselves.  Great specials on smoothies and juices.  Definitely worth a try, and the secluded back yard patio is nice.    They do have a credit card machine now."}
{"text":"Do not order the nachos! Its a bag of tostitos poured onto a plate with shreds of unmelted cheese and frozen (literally) sour cream. The service was good as were the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"This is a very cute and friendly spot to grab brunch! We wandered into here spontaneously on a day off from work. It was a nice lazy Tuesday afternoon and the place was practically empty. No wait at all.   The atmosphere was very pleasant - we sat on the back patio, soaked in the sunshine and enjoyed eggs Benedict and good conversation for a good hour or two. The service was warm and welcoming, and we didn't feel rushed at all.  While the brunch itself wasn't particularly unique or mind blowing (we live in a culinary hub, so the standards are admittedly very high!)...it was a nice, solid breakfast with good service, ample space and the price was right. I'd go back!  Note: this review is based off of my experience year last Summer...I totally forgot to write it back then but still remember it fondly!"}
