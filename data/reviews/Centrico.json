{"text":"Walking by on Monday and stopped in for lunch.  Nice bright and airy space.  Had the chips and salsa and shrimp tacos .  The house margarita with grilled lime was very tasty.  Everything was very fresh. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great service!  Food was great!  I had the shrimp tacos my friend had the steak tacos we split our orders so that we could try them both.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great experience!  We made a reservation for 8 PM, showed up they our the table ready for us and the servers were just pouring our waters as we walked up.  The owner greeted us and explained some of the dishes, and recommended the appetizers of cheese fondue and chili verde which were absolutely fabulous and came with homemade flour tortillas. We shared dinners and had the Beef Asada tacos and the chicken enchiladas, and both were great!  The margaritas were fabulous. as the tequila was some of the best I've ever had.  We visit Phoenix about once a month, and this will be on our list every trip.  I think it was the best Mexican restaurant I've eaten at."}
{"text":"Great place! The shrimp empanadas were delicious. The chicken enchiladas were very authentic. The selection of tequila and mezcal is imppressive. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican I've had in town. The fish tacos were great, and the steak on the steak tacos is some of the best I've ever had. Awesome chips and salsa too, for what that's worth. Looking forward to seeing what their dinner menu will include."}
{"text":"This was a great place to try on my trip to Phoenix for a convention. They were open to take our group when they were about to close their lunch window. Not just all the staff was accommodating but the food and the Margaritas were delicious! A downtown gem!"}
{"text":"The food was great! The service was faster than anywhere I've ever eaten out! The server and manager were so attentive and kind! The veggie tacos were such a unique twist on tacos with the dehydrated corn and dressing. There was no wait for lunch on a Tuesday! And it's centrally located in downtown Phoenix! The salsa was fresh and the pricing was appropriate!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend who was vegetarian on day for lunch.  We started with chips and salsa, which were good.  They didn't have veggie tacos specially on the menu, but they were able to accomodate us. My friend really enjoyed them!  There was grilled onion, peppers, corn, and more.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were also tasty.  Their sides of rice and beans are really big for one serving.  I recommend sharing them if you both are planning to order them.  They come out separately in different bowls. I'm glad they are in the downtown area and will be going back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Best fish tacos I have had by far, super crunchy batter, delicious white fish, organic yellow corn tortillas, yummy chipotle mayo, and spicy, yet tasty chile de arbol salsa.  Chips and salsa were great. Made fresh!! Nothing basic about this place!! I just wish they were open later than 2pm!!"}
{"text":"Had a lazy lunch here with friends. The cocktails were decent, food ranged from mediocre to good, but not great - the guac and chips were good, the queso fundido was tasty but too thin (had to wait for it to thicken - was soupy), my steak tacos were dry and a little tough, one of my party did not finish her veg tacos. Service was good except for the manager who dug a little too personally and lingered too long while stopping by to see how we were doing. Not sure I would give it a shot for redemption."}
{"text":"Lovely queso fundido (despite the nice but absent-minded server forgetting the chorizo) with wonderful flour tortillas! The asada tacos were good but not mind blowing and the iced tea was as described in another review, very much bottom of the bucket. But overall a nice change from Montana's version of Mexican fare."}
{"text":"The best Mexican I've ever had. Period. I don't even like Margaritas and after tasting it I had to order the sweet & sour Margarita. We had the chips and guacamole. They made the guacamole at the table. I ordered the chicken tacos and the Tuna ceviche. Both were delicious. Both ended with a little spice but not too much. The ceviche was different than a traditional ceviche. I loved the mole suave, the mango and the slight spice at the end. I'd highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great brunch this last Sunday with a fantastic Chilaquiles and Omelette for us. Really good Michelada and not to bad Bloody Mary. We will order Micheladas for both of us next time and keep enjoying our new favorite place."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast!! Order El Mexicano you won't be sorry. Ripe avocado, huevos Mexicano, handmade tortillas, excellent beans!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to downtown! Great service. Our table tried several items- all perfectly prepared! A little spicy for me- but I am a huge whimp with spice... even with the heat I could taste the flavors. There was a braised beef dish my non-spicy self devoured. Hope these guys stay here we loved bringing out of town guests- try them you will love it!"}
{"text":"Go.  Order the chips and salsa.  Enjoy people watching in downtown Phoenix.  Get the Pork Chili Verde.  Have your mind blown.  Rinse. Repeat."}
{"text":"Overall, this place was great! You aren't going to get better service and the food was pretty spot on. The two areas of improvement from my perspective were the iced tea, it tasted old like it was the bottom of the barrel and it was cold. It was a chilly day outside and because it was so crowded, I think, the doors were open which left for a little bit of an uncomfortable environment.   For the positives, from the second I walked in the service was sensational. I arrived early for my reservation and was escorted to the bar for a beverage. My table was ready on time and everyone who worked there truly seemed to care about their patrons. The chips and warm salsa were delightful. I will caution you that if you are sensitive to spice, this salsa may be too hot. I ordered the Centrico Chopped Salad and my colleague ordered the Tortilla Soup. We both loved our food and would happily get it again.   I definitely recommend this place, but suggest a reservation. It's a small joint, but worth it!"}
{"text":"After spending most of the day out in the town this was a really nice night cap. Came in for the margaritas stayed because of the friendly owner. He came over and had a really cool conversation about his incredible family and upbringing. I love that about our city! Loved the fact that the margaritas had a spicy twist (the rim had the chili powder we all go crazy for) it was a little crowded because of the St. Patrick's day crowd. I wish they would have kept the kitchen open longer because I did want some chips and salsa. If you're in the area stop by and have a drink or two! Say hi to Edson-- the super friendly owner! More people need to know about this place."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in the downtown scene! I've had their breakfast - which was amazing. I ordered a deconstructed breakfast burrito with a side of bacon. The bacon is flavored flavored and it was cooked perfectly--just tell them how you like it. I returned a second time for lunch and it was not by chance that I would give them a rave review. They are that good. Order anything and it will be great. The staff and ambiance"}
{"text":"I was downtown with a friend and we decided to grab lunch in the area last minute.  We were just walking along when we chose Centrico on a whim. Right when we walked in the door, we were greeted with such warm service. We wanted to sit on one of the high tops outside, since it was such a lovely day. I ordered the tacos pescado, which is your typical fish taco, but it was a delightful lunch and plated beautifully.  Darien was a great server, and the entire staff we interacted with was amazing. What a great local spot to enjoy the day and people watch."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! Walked in just to have a cocktail before meeting friends at another spot downtown. Great selection of tequilas, mezcal and even a couple sotols. Looking forward to making my way through them all."}
{"text":"This Mexican restaurant in Downtown Phoenix is precious! If you like spicy Mexican food, then this is the place to go.   Service:  Food:  *Queso Fundido* the cheese was alright, nothing too special, but the tortillas make this appetizer SO appetizing! The tortillas are homemade, grilled, thin, and super soft. Super yummy  *Guacamole* warning, this guacamole is spicy because of the serrano pepper they add to it! The waiter mixes it up table-side. This has great flavor, the perfect appetizer to share.  *Shrimp Tacos- 4 small shrimp tacos. These were the perfect size. My friend and I shared the Queso Fundido, chips and salsa, and had 2 each of the tacos.    Drinks*  Margaritas- I ordered a regular margarita on the rocks which was on the menu, and it was perfect. The drinks are served in small glasses, but are strong and tasty.    I recommend coming to this restaurant, especially with a group of friends  if you're planning to go out in the Downtown Phoenix area. You can eat dinner here, pregame a little, and head out to the nearby bars/clubs after!   Check out my food pics on my Instagram: @deeps.eats =)"}
{"text":"The chilaquiles are the best ever! The environment is awesome and the view is excellent as well. Some of the best service ive ever received."}
{"text":"Wow - such a great addition to the downtown Phoenix dining scene!  We stopped in for dinner last Friday night and had a great experience - engaging staff, nice decor (and they really maximized the small indoor/outdoor space without it feeling crowded) and super tasty food!   I started with a glass of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and we had the chips and salsa, carne asada tacos (my favorite), shrimp tacos, a side of rice and a side of chorizo to share.     I think Centrico is just what this space needed...excited to see their expanded menu in the coming weeks/months."}
{"text":"Had the Asada street tacos and they were excellent!! Cool new spot owner was awesome and gracious to open up the kitchen for us after they closed. Will deffinately come back."}
{"text":"This eatery is located on the bottom floor of historic Hotel San Carlos in Downtown Phoenix. It has indoor and outdoor patio seating.  The food was pretty good and tasty but the portions were on the small side.   I had Tacos Gobernador. Those are the shrimp tacos and they are delicious and fresh! A little spicy.  I also tried Tacos de Asada with nopalitos. Nope. No nopalitos. I took those off and I can't say I was a fan of the red chipotle sauce. Meat was savory. Next time I order them, it will be without those two items.   They have chilaquiles. Definitely trying them next visit.   Service gets two thumbs up. Music is de bomba.  The reason why I'm giving this four stars (there is no 4.5) is that you will get up-charged for everything. Pricey for the small portions and limited menu. I understand, that the rents must have gone up. As the last two restaurants who tried to make it a go in this same spot, left.  You cannot mix and match your street tacos. You get one type only. They are talking about adding dinner menu soon.    Two sets of street tacos and an ice tea plus tip was close to $30."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch food, excellent drinks, wonderful atmosphere and staff! Definitely one of my new favorite downtown spots to grab a bite or hang out and have a drink!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and I loved both of the dishes I tried. All options on the menu sound good, but the chili verde and tortilla soup were a great choice. The ambience was great, friendly staff, and I got to chat with the owner for a little bit. I will definitely stop by again. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican food and the best salsa you'll find around town. Super tastey drinks - a great selection of tequila and mescal. Great vibe and great location. Last but not least, excellent service!  Perfect spot for brunch on the patio, too!"}
{"text":"In Phoenix for the holidays and found this awesome spot. Walked by and stopped in for breakfast. Delicious pancakes, chilaquiles, and coffee from Mexico.   Has a very cool vibe, great music, and awesome food. It was so good that we went back for drinks that night. Amazing Tequila based drinks and great music.   Definitely a great new spot. Coming back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I went for their breakfast and I have to say that the food and service were amazing! I will definitely go back. I also want to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Super dope bar located @Hotel San Carlos downtown! Very nice vibe and a lot of tequila selection! The setup is very nice and cozy and the staff is very friendly and quick ! We didn't get to try the food but can't wait to come back for it!"}
{"text":"I had the most delicious breakfast here with my girlfriend. We tried to eat there on a Monday (they're closed on Mondays) so I was glad that we were able to try again the next day.   Our meal started with two coffees brewed from some exotic Mexican mountaintop coffee bean that the good folks at Centrico import themselves to serve in the restaurant. I recently stopped taking sugar so I can taste the coffee even more now and this brew was delcious! They even had almond creamer to go with it. I ordered the chilaquiles and my friend ordered the migas with a side of papas. Both dishes were very tasty and filling! They used two different types of salsa on our dishes and they were both incredibly flavorful, one spicy and one not.   The ambience also contributed to our meal. The owner, Edson, came and spoke with us about the development of the restaurant and asked if we were enjoying our meal. A lot of thought was put into the decor of the place. There were old Mexican films playing in the background, a stellar Fortoul brothers painting centrally displayed, a beautiful and well-stocked tequila bar, and a solid mix of Mexican traditional and popular music playing. I definitely want to come back, both at night to experience the cozy bar, and while their kitchen is open to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Just in town for a few days. Loved the food and the tequila drinks. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here. The chipotle margarita was sensational. Sweet and a bit spicy . Chilaquiles Rojo were amazing and vegan without the cheese. There are also vegetables tacos that I will be trying next time I eat here. The ambience is very Quaint yet modern. I would recommend grabbing a seat at the bar so you get to know the staff."}
{"text":"Yooooo. Place was great. Friendly owner and staff and even better food! I'm just sad I didn't wear my stretchy pants because I filled up too quick on the delicious food. I ordered the green chilaquiles and they were perf. Not soggy, not hard af... just perf. The green sauce is so flavorful, it has a lime zest to it. My friend ordered the fish tacos and they were on point. We also got to try watermelon margaritas. Mind you all of this was around 9 am but like they say it's 5'o clock somewhere so I had another one. I can't wait to go back. As far as the location goes, it's downtown so Parkin is not ideal but this place is cute and modern. Love the decor and rock en español playing. I only have good things to say about this spot."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch and happy hour places downtown. The food is great, service is pleasant and quick, drinks are always on point.. Can't go wrong! And it's in the center of downtown close to EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"This is a brand new restaurant no more than six months old but this is going to make it to one of the top places in downtown for sure.  They have the street tacos kind of flavors good chicken and steak tacos are out of the world the steak once have a little bit of spice send them the chicken ones are very unique add a little bit of lime on it and it taste out of the world.  My daughter ordered the vegetarian tacos and they were fantastic very flavorful. Most vegetarian tacos have fajita kind of stuff but these ones were so flavorful so if you have a vegetarian in your party come over and enjoy it. The rice unfortunately is made in chicken broth but is extremely delicious.  I got the Arnold Palmer and it was made perfect thank you David for giving us an amazing experience and taking such good care of us he told us how nicely the southside is freshly made every day in the morning with roasted tomatoes onions. Don't forget to order the guac which is made while you are enjoying your drinks right in front of you on your table  David"}
{"text":"A delectable delight!  The staff was engaging and informative for our post-lunch meal as three of us visit the valley for a few days.    We shared two appetizers: the avocado dip and the verde chili.  Very fresh flavors.    We really enjoyed sharing our orders of chicken, shrimp, & veggie tacos.  The combinations of flavors make my mouth water again just writing this here.    I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and customer service right next to the historic San Carlos hotel. I have had the bacon cheeseburger and the chopped salad. Both were excellent and the freshness of the ingredients was apparent. The vibe of the restaurant is great, the tequila bar looks excellent although I haven't been here outside of work hours so I haven't ordered any drinks here. All in all this place is a pretty good downtown addition."}
{"text":"Steak tacos were great! Shrimp tacos could have been better but that was my fault for not reading that they came served on corn tacos instead of flour. I hate corn tacos. Chips & salsa were good!"}
{"text":"This is not your big platter of main course, retried beans with melted cheese, and rice kind of Mexican restaurant. No free chips and salsa either but they do have homemade tortillas, delicious tortilla soup and savory chili verde. It was all delicious.."}
{"text":"A gem!  We started with the table side guacamole which was simple but delish!  The avocados were perfectly ripe and our server added just a dash of onion and tomato for flavor. Yum!  3 of us ordered the steak tacos for lunch and I think all 3 of us were left wanting to order more.  The meat was seasoned and tender, not over cooked and bland as is often the case.  Our fourth had an allergy to garlic (what?) and the server and kitchen went out of their way to accommodate his needs.  The tortilla soup was tried by all and had a kick and lovely flavors from the obviously fresh ingredients.  The experience was so good, we went back the following day and enjoyed it just as much.  The owner is engaged and takes a genuine interest and  pride in his diners experience.  For those living or working in the area, I'm so jealous!  And to all who can, run, don't walk to get yourself some yum!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. If you love tacos I highly recommend this place, my favorite are the beer battered fish tacos. Another favorite of mine is the Chili Verde Bowl."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is sooooo authentic and amazing. I felt so great being here. The owner Pete was so inviting and kind to me. I ordered chips and salsa and that was just the beginning to my carne asada taco journey that made me feel magical. The music and staff make you feel soooo at ease. Thank you so much for the great food, great time, and fantastic hospitality. You truly are a blessing."}
{"text":"Centrico was a great place to stop and get some delicious Mexican food on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Big Jose brought us top notch margaritas and made our guacamole fresh at the table. Ordered fish tacos, shrimp tacos, the burger and Queso Fundido - nothing disappoints!   Service was fast and excellent."}
{"text":"Found this place just walking by while visiting PHX last week.    Wow, it was like going back to my childhood.  Authentic Mexican food, amazing staff, so friendly and welcoming.  I ordered the chorizo breakfast and then next day ordered the burrito, deconstructed, I like to tear my tortillas and scoop up the food and added beans.  The flavor was perfect, portion was ample.  If you want some real food get there, then go again, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could! We were in town for a conference and eating here multiple times became our favorite part of Phoenix. Guacamole and margaritas were phenomenal, the owner and staff were amazing and kind. Locally and independently owned, give them your support!"}
{"text":"Food was good, outside patio seating wasn't the best choice with the light rail and bus fumes."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot located right across the street from Cornish Pasty in Downtown Phoenix. Not busy on a Sunday afternoon which was nice, order took a little longer than was expecting but my meal was really good. Tried the Chilaquiles (rojo sauce) with over easy eggs. Tasted very authentic and the tortillas was cooked just right where some were crunchy and some were soft that blended really well with the egg yolk. Nice portion that had me full throughout the afternoon. If your craving Mexican food DT PHX, this is a legit spot."}
{"text":"I came here last week after searching yelp reviews. It was a late lunch and I was still on Michigan time so I was very hungry by the time I got there. I got lucky with a parking meter that still had over an hour left on it :) I sat at the bar and ordered the shrimp tacos with flour tortillas with chips and salsa. The chips and salsa were really tasty but they warmed up the salsa which I'm not really a fan of. I don't mind it but don't love it. I prefer it cold or room temp. The waitress brought me fish tacos by mistake which I gladly ate. She also brought me the shrimp tacos to go which I later ate in my hotel room and really loved. The owner was at the bar while I was there and we chatted a bit. He told me about the history of the location and his restaurant and their business processes. Everything is homemade and fresh and I loved that. He was really great and I hope he stays in business for a long time. His drink preparation sounded good but I wasn't in the mood to drink so I didn't order one. I will def go back when in the area again."}
{"text":"Phenomenal flavors !!! Equally phenomenal server - David.  Knew we should go local flavor and this surpassed any expectations.  The Rojas sauce and the Verde sauce on the chicken enchilada was just the right smoke and spice flavor combination.  Chicken was perfectly pull tenderness.  Ahi ceviche nice light meal with lots of sweet mango.  And then the table made guacamole had all the right mix of white onion and pepper heat.  You can't go wrong giving this place a go."}
{"text":"Look, I know this is an amazing Mexican spot here in DT PHX.... But try the burgers... When I tell you it's seriously the best homestyle burgers I've had since leaving the midwest ....I MEAN IT!!  Also, this place is super cute.   Small space, big flavor!  Major recommend? if you're? ever looking for a nice breakfast/ lunch/ or dinner while visiting PHX!"}
{"text":"This by far has been my best experience with a small restaurant in years. The staff is so friend and helpful and willing to make your experience amazing. Will be back again."}
{"text":"My first meal here was top notch. When you're downtown you've got to stop by and pay a visit. You won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Live music and great food! Can't wait to go back. Try the queso it was so good! Came with homemade tortillas which were so good !"}
{"text":"We stayed downtown at the Hilton Garden Inn and this place is across the street. We came here twice and both times the food and service was excellent. The server and manager came over several times to check in on us but let us sit and enjoy the meal. If you're in downtown this will be a great place to have some excellent Mexican food in a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Been here twice in two weeks now. SUPER GOOD. For drinks... I began with the watermelon margarita (a recommendation made by the waiter)... this was really good! Strong, but good. A woman from the table next to us strongly suggested trying the Aye yai yai.. I was a little hesitant ordering a drink consisting of egg whites and lavender. However, it was DELICIOUS.  I ordered both of these drinks the next time I came here as well. My boyfriend was a fan of the chipotle margarita and swears that this is the best margarita he has ever had. Moving onto the food...you will not be disappointed by the carne asada tacos. Yum! Also, the guacamole is fresh and delicious too. I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great spot in downtown Phoenix. Centrico came in with strong Yelp reviews AND a tortilla soup on their menu so I decided to make the trek. The staff is very friendly and welcoming, and the site is clean. I ordered the tortilla soup with a side of guacamole and chips. Sorry to say the soup wasn't great - that's the ONLY reason for the 3 stars. The soup didn't seem fresh and there was barely any chicken in it. Major dissapointment. That said, I would return to try other menu items and for happy hour!"}
{"text":"They are a little expensive but that's because it's attached to a hotel. To me the food is mediocre. The chips and salsa are a little bland and the tacos are just okay. The 5 star reviews had my hopes up but the food is just alright. Not worth the money in my opinion, but the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Love!! Love!! Love!! What a great place to talk and sip tequila...   don't know much about sipping tequila? The owner will tell you all about it..."}
{"text":"Wow, I highly recommend Centrico! Delicious!! And what a great location.  A fun place to watch people. The guacamole was made fresh at our table and paired with fresh-made tortilla chips mmmm. The margaritas are amazing - not too sweet with that fresh lime citrus taste, and the tacos are made with homemade tortillas and are so good! We each ordered a plate and then split them. The owner, Pete, is a great guy and wonderful host and made sure we were well taken . This success couldn't happen to a more deserving guy. I'm definitely going back, and next time I'm bringing friends and family."}
{"text":"Did not have time to take many pictures. But let me say there is one item I am addicted to.....the queso fondido. It is worth the time to just have this. The fish tacos are amazing......but did I say the fondido  is addicting!"}
{"text":"They opened up at 730 and I had the chile verde omelet with a lemonade.  Let me tell you the Flavors  going on in that omelet are immense. From the green chile to the chorizo to the egg itself.  Just amazing I recommend it. The lemonade was absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"While visiting the downtown scene due to a event at the Phoenix Convention Center I wanted to walk rather than drive to get a bite to eat.  This restaurant was in the radius I was looking for so we took a chance.    The location is in the San Carlos Hotel; an older hotel that shows it flare of being reborn again.  Very nice corner location on the bottom floor.  There was plenty of employees for the size of the place and Service was quick.  It felt like a locally owned spot rather than a chain, which I love.  The staff was full of suggestions and I even had a wonderful Tequila.   The tacos were just the right portions for one and the guacamole dip was to die for.    Definitely will be back on my next expedition downtown."}
{"text":"As a Downtown Phoenix enthusiast I'm always excited to try new spots, especially if they're serving Mexican cuisine. Unfortunately Céntrico leaves much to be desired.  We arrived around 7:30pm and the place was relatively empty. Still it took about 10 minutes to order. We're not these bougie, entitled people, but being ignored for that long at a restaurant is unacceptable. Our waitress finally took our order, doing so from memory. (This worried me as we ordered quite a few items)  While waiting for our food, another server bumped  into our table hard enough to cause my girlfriend to spill her drink on the table and herself. He didn't even bother say \"oops, sorry\" just continued walking as if he didn't feel it.  Finally, our food arrived and of course my girlfriend's order was wrong, confirming my concern when our waitress took our order. In fairness, the owner or manager did acknowledge the error and offered to correct it, but we stuck with the food.  As for the food: The Asada Tacos were a little rough, the Fish Tacos were small bits of battered fish, hardly any to fill the tortilla. The Guacamole lacked salt and the rice, while flavorful, was undercooked.  We walked away from this experience paying $54 not a fortune, but more than we'd like to pay for the level of service. I'm sorry to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing \"home feel\" with the most unique margaritas in town. Great DJ and atmosphere of downtown Phx life. A must visit!!"}
