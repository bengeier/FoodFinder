{"text":"Every visit to my parents we go here and this particular time, we ordered takeout. You know a business actually cares, when they call you about a mistake on the bill after you left. That gives them a lot of credibility and I do appreciate that they adjusted it on their end after a very nice voicemail.

And their pizzas are pretty amazing too... Definitely get the wings and the greens & beans.... So good!!! I like flavor and food that makes you want that last bite!!"}
{"text":"The Pizza was just ok. We were actually disappointed. The crust I thought was paper thin, the banana peppers tasted weird. We didn't even bring left overs home. We will not go back. We did however like they had nice indoor and outdoor seating with free wifi."}
{"text":"Leaving another review because if you haven't tried this place you really should. It is fantastic.  We order from here once a month or more and we have never had anything even remotely bad, ever.  We have tried the pizza, wings, sandwiches, breadsticks... Every single thing is fantastic and quality food.  

The staff are efficient and pleasant always.  We typically do take out orders and they always have the order right, no matter how complicated.  

Try this place! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"I had the Caprese Panini twice now at The Oven and the sandwich was excellent. The balsamic vinaigrette that is added to the panini creates this tasteful, moist layer that complements the mozzarella, basil and tomato perfectly. The panini comes with a side dish; I had the hummus and the baked apples and they were both very good. I'm not a big fan of pizza in general, so I can't comment on theirs but the Caprese Panini is definitely a winner... it will make me return for more."}
{"text":"Totally sucks. Ordered a meatball pizza. It came with no meat and some globs if disgusting goo all over the top. My first and last visit to this place. Do yourself a favor and stay away!!"}
{"text":"Very quaint/hipsterish. Nice seating area with a couple of televisions mounted. Staff was very friendly and helpful, and service was quick. 

I ordered red pizza. It was brick oven pizza, which was great. There were a variety of toppings to chose from. Soups looked good, but didn't try them. Gelato was terrific.

I wish I ordered the wings. They looked tremendous. They come plain, but with dipping sauce. Many other things on the menu."}
{"text":"As a loyal customer I enjoyed this restaurant multiple times a week despite their mistakes on almost every order. Over time those mistakes became less subtle and more annoying until The Oven messed up my entire taken out order. When I called and spoke to the \"manager\" who also happened to be in the owners family (he didn't say his name) his response was just a simple I'm sorry. After the call ended I found more mistakes in my order after checking it over thoroughly. I decided to call back and was given another pathetic apology and a refund. At no point did the manager take ownership of the issue and address it, he simply gave a half hearted apology which he thought was good enough. I don't know about you but poor customer service like that ruins a restaurant for me. I choose where I eat based on the quality of the food, and how good the service is. While he food may have been good when prepared correctly the service was not. There are too many high school aged children working there who don't understand how to be polite and take an order which only adds to the issues here. I'm rather disappointed mainly because this was one of my favorite casual places to get a bite and now it is black listed for the above reasons among others I have experienced. I would stay away from here if you value getting what you ordered and not dealing with rude owners."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza.  My favorite pizza place.  Awesome fresh ingredients. Wood ovens no comparison to any take out pizza for flavor or crust.  La Prima coffee served my favorite coffee place in Strip District. Love love love the self service red pepper flakes garlic and other delicious spices and cheeses to top pizza. Sausage is amazing topping there and fire roasted veggies relish!  Did I mention the salads, paninis or gellato??  Top lunch in area hands down and hip place to chill with friends or family!"}
{"text":"So you go to a pizza place that has a brick oven up front, even had wood burning in it. What are you there to get? You guessed it, a brick oven pizza. When you watch the oven, your pizza never goes in, then comes out from the back, obviously not cooked in a brick oven, you feel duped. 
Kind of like going to an amusement park to find all the rides are closed, but they can show you videos of people riding them. Fail!
The pizza itself wasn't even that good, almost on par with a frozen pizza you can cook yourself."}
{"text":"The breadsticks are the worse bread sticks I have ever seen and tasted, they are completely  flat. The sauce is horrible as well as the cheese."}
{"text":"In the area for work and this place caught my eye. Very nice casual atmosphere with a spacious side patio area. Staff were very helpful explaining the menu and options. I had the wings which were exceptional and pita/hummus as a side - also very good. Will be back next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"The wood smoke lures you into the restaurant like flies to horse manure, which is exaclty what the pizza tastes like. The above-head menu is easy to order from and is simplified for the yuppy idiotic customers who frequent this sub par eatery. The dough is pre made and quickly reheated in a wood fired oven, which often leaves both the crust and fresh toppings undercooked. 

  Within 3 minutes of ordering, our entire selection was ready for us to pick up from the counter. Which was the first red flag as to how shitty the food would taste. Only a fool would consider instantaneous pizza and wings to be a frugal alternative to a family dinner. 

  The chicken wings, on the other hand, are definitely worth purchasing. Although, they are also reheated and seasoned. And from what I've heard, the Panini are out of this world. So, I am enthralled to give this restaurant a single star rating.

  A meal is only as good as the time and effort put in to making it. And this place falls short on every level."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch or coffee. I shared a pizza with a coworker for lunch and thought that it was really great that they could do two different sauces on one pizza. We couldn't decide between the white pizza or the traditional red sauce, so this was a perfect compromise. We opted for the whole wheat crust, and I was very pleased with the taste and texture of it. You could barely tell it was wheat rather than the traditional white crust. I loved the fire roasted tomato topping and the pizza was nice and crispy. I preferred the white pizza over the traditional red, but both were tasty. On other occasions I've had the grilled chicken salad and lattes. The salad was fresh and simple, though the dressing was slightly vinegary for my taste. The lattes were great!"}
{"text":"The walnut feta pizza with fig glaze was the best pizza I have ever had! The sweetness of the figs blended with the crunchy walnuts and then the feta brought the creaminess.
Simply fantastic."}
{"text":"Very nice place to eat and a very friendly enviroment. Food is absolutely delicious. Very clean restraunt aswell. Very easy to order and wait time for your food is very good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The pizza is awesome and definitely different than your average slice. All of the bread for the pizza and panini's are cooked in a fire oven. I recommend the vodka pizza and chicken BBQ bacon panini. The chicken ranch panini is also delicious! They have a Pick Two option with pizza, bread sticks, salad, soup, or wings... perfect for those who can't choose! 

The service is very quick and friendly. It use to be a a BYOB before they changed the name and remodeled a little on the inside. They now serve wine and beer. It has outdoor seating which is nice in the summer. They offer frozen grapes as a side or chips. They also have homemade ice cream! 

I have yet to try their breakfast but it looks great. This has become our 'go-to' for lunch and dinner close to home."}
{"text":"Pizza is mostly crust  not spectacular sauce wait is long no service overpriced won't be back"}
{"text":"Great salads. Wings. Sandwiches. Brick oven pizzas. They do a good job even when it's crowded or on weekends. Reasonably priced. Our usual hangout. Good for kids as there is outdoor sitting during summer."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to eating here for months after rave reviews from friends and I was not disappointed. Everything was delicious, the staff was right on point and I even ordered additional pizzas to take home for later! I'm looking forward to my next trip out there!"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 pizzas from this place for a colleague 's last day and  we were kind of disappointed .There was almost no cheese on the pizzas and each pizza came with a small container of fancy dressing ,that nobody opened. Next time I will try the traditional pizzas."}
{"text":"Had a few pies here on a friday night and was impressed! Great pizza. Wings were pretty good as well. Kind of a goofy setup (similar to panera) but will definitely be back. Best pizza in the area. A little better than Aviva even."}
{"text":"First visit today.  Worst pizza we ever ate.  No taste whatsoever, no hint of a wood fired crust.  We will stick with Mama Lucia's in the same area."}
{"text":"This our one of our favorite places in Wexford. The food is very fresh and very tasty. There are many options. The gluten free pita  is the best I have ever had. This restaurant  is a very healthy option in the area.  I highly recommend The Oven."}
{"text":"Great Pizza! A must stop whenever I am in the Pittsburgh area! Staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it was Azzeria, I love it now as City Oven and hope to love it when it changes over to \"The Oven\".  We stopped in for dinner last night, after several other lunch visits and had a  great experience. We ordered two pizzas, one with just pepperoni and one with fire roasted spinach and mushrooms.  I also got a salad and breadsticks.  All were amazing, as usual.  I have also tried their panini's and gelato in the past and they are amazing.  The fire roasted toppings give all entrees that extra touch.  The pizza crust is soooo good as it has a crunch yet is soft inside. 

I love the atomosphere as the \"garage\" doors are open to the outdoor seating area during nice weather creating an open and inviting atmoshpere.  Last night, we even had a visit to our table from the owner/manager making sure we were happy with everything.  

The only thing that can be improved is the staff asking if you have visited before and, if not, giving the customer a little direction on how they will get their food, that it is self-service, where the drinks are and maybe explain the oil/seasonings stand."}
{"text":"Being a first-timer, I stood at the entrance waiting to be seated.  Didn't realize that you order your food, seat yourself, get called when the food is ready, and then pick it up at the window.  

I ordered enough for lunch tomorrow.  1/2 Mediterranean 1/2 spinach pizza on a thin whole wheat crust and romaine salad with a REALLY GOOD vinagarette.  The hummus with flat bread was also tasty. 

There were 3 soup options and a wine list.

Ample parking.  Will go back to try other options."}
{"text":"We loved this place several years ago.  Now, the pizzas have less than 4 tablespoons of tomato sauce on them and less than 3 ounces of cheese. Forget about getting pepperoni unless you have some at home to add to it.  Even our toddlers would NOT eat what we brought home.   We will never go back or get take-out again."}
{"text":"The dough has nice feel and flavor all it's own. Both slices had the red sauce which was fresh tasting and not too heavy. I'm looking forward to trying the other sauces in the future. 

1. BBQ pork slice. It does have a little spice that catches up to you.  All in all it has a good flavor. I was actually happy that it didn't have a heavy BBQ taste. It certainly isn't a mass produced sugary flavor that looks like tar.

2. Meatza slice. The bacon taste is the best and steals the show. The sausage and pepperoni helped make this have more of a \"traditional\" feeling pizza. I could really taste the wood fire more in this one. Better than the BBQ Pork. 

The Meatball was okay but wasn't anything super special. It could have been a little warmer. The Ricotta was a nice touch and made the sauce really nice for dipping after the meatball was gone. 

The Hummus was really good. We even bought some to take home. It was a nice change from the run of the mill chain pizza factories. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner and had an overall good experience. We tried their white pizza, which featured provolone, mozzarella, romano, ricotta cheeses & garlic. They have a very nice atmosphere set up with large doors that open up the side of the building to the outdoor patio. 

We had a few concerns during our visit. Nobody greeted us or showed up to a table, though it was not difficult to find one available. The restaurant has the look of a place that would have waiter service, but it's very much a serve-yourself experience. Orders are taken at the front and they call your name when your food is available. When we got our pizza we had to track down our own plates to eat with, which were tucked away near the fountain drinks. We were also disappointed with the small size of the cups we got for the drinks that we ordered. Overall there is very little direction or input from the staff - so if you're new here be aware of that. 

Still, we enjoyed it and will likely add this to our repertoire of restaurants that we visit."}
{"text":"The oven has always made the best pizza. They offer many options, from crust to toppings. They also offer gluten free crust for a healthier option. Their \"pick up\" option is very quick. They cook the pizza when you show up & it only takes about 2 minutes. They offer delicious soups as well. They are a bit pricy which is why I gave them a 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"The Oven is a great place to find inexpensive, well-prepared food. We live nearby, so we stopped by while walking the dog, as there is a patio, which allows dogs. We both tried the garden vegetable brick oven pizza, and we were impressed. We will be coming here often."}
{"text":"Pizza here was better than average, and the soup was pretty good too. It is one of those, go up to the counter and order then they bring the food to you. We got a veggie pizza and curry soup. Both were better than average, but the restaurant was freezing inside :("}
{"text":"As you can see, Azzeria has turned into the City Oven. Now it's a fast dining type establishment that serves brick oven pizzas, paninis, brick oven wings and gelato. I had the wings and a panini and thought it was pretty good, especially for the type of place it's emulating (sort of a Panera bread of pizza?). The brick oven charred the wings slightly and made them really, really tasty. I'm usually not a fan of \"oven-cooked wings\" but the high heat of their oven made them delicious.

The panini was a little thin and crispy but the sausage and peppers were tasty. I've had heartier paninis but this was pretty good for a lunch.

The gelato was smooth and creamy but their flavors were better suited for Baskin Robbins. I wanted Pistachio which they were out of. I settled on chocolate and peanut butter. It was really good."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn awesome.  I love the combo -- pizza/salad, pizza/wings, pizza/soup.  food is good -- staff friendly and laid back"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Pizza is terrific, service is terrific and James, the manager is why we come. Not only does he make a great pie, extremely personable and makes you really feel welcomed. Will defiantly come back!!!"}
{"text":"The line to order took forever, they screwed up the salad order, the pizza was so-so and I paid for a glass of wine and got less than an inch of my glass filled. It's 90 degrees out today and they opened all of the doors when it's incredibly humid. They also allowed families with misbehaved children to run throughout the restaurant screaming and bumping into our table. I will never go here again and no one else should."}
{"text":"Husband and I tried this for the first time tonight. Well, we came home hungry after spending $45 on what I'm not sure. Two paninis, one with a salad and one with wedding soup, and a margherita pizza.  My panini was good (portobello with sweet onions and balsamic).  His panini was described as \"not good and there was a specific few bites that were 'bad' because all the spice was placed into that spot and I wanted to gag\".  Being Italian I should have known better than to expect much from a pizza place's wedding soup. The broth was pretty dark in color and had a basil taste to it.  It was so so, but I wouldn't call it wedding soup.  The little meatballs were the only part I truly enjoyed. We both tried the pizza. It's pretty bad when I was convinced there was goat cheese on it because goat cheese has a very specific taste, only to find out it was mozzarella.  I've never tasted mozzarella like that. Husband said it was very bland. We boxed it up anyway.  I can bet we will be throwing it out on garbage day. 
We both felt that if we were going to spend that much money (which we are totally comfortable spending on dinner) that we would have rather gone to a steakhouse. Ugh.  Maybe we should have stuck to pizza, and a different kind. I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for pizza! I like their pick two menu option, which allows me to get a healthy salad and delicious pizza. I'm hooked on Meatza pizza with its crunchy toppings. Excellent!  I also love the sweet roasted red pepper panini. Yum! I highly recommend The Oven Pizza Company to everyone!"}
{"text":"If a place has buffalo chicken pizza on the menu I have tried it, so needless to say I have eaten  a ton at a lot of different places. The buffalo chicken pizza at The Oven is hands down my favorite. The crust, buffalo sauce and ranch dizzle is divine. I pair it with a small spinach salad, which has the best candied walnuts.
And as an added bonus The Oven now has pepsi products."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! I love that they offer gluten and dairy free pizzas and paninis. Their staff is always friendly and courteous. Nice place for a middle of the road price-point."}
{"text":"We have ordered many, many times from The Oven Pizza Co. over the past 18 months since we moved to the area. The pizza is delicious, and as a gluten-free eater, their gluten-free pizza is very good. (I also appreciate how fresh their ingredients taste!) 

But we have never, ever received our order 100% correctly. Always one detail is left out. We've probably ordered 12 times at this point. Most of the time we make the 15 minute drive home and realize that the dipping sauces are missing. Or my gluten-free pizza is missing a topping, which has happened the last two times. 

(I should mention, too: an average order for a whole wheat pizza and a gluten free pizza, with dipping sauces, is always about $40-45, which is a LOT for a \"quick bite of pizza\" in our budget. This place is not the cheapest option, but we're willing to do it because it tastes very good and they have gluten-free options.) 

Anyways, they are always apologetic and have refunded us for the missing dipping sauces, but it is the one significant strike against an otherwise good pizza place."}
{"text":"The Oven is within walking distance to our home. My kids would be content to eat dinner here every night. The salads, wings and pizza are all delicious. I look forward to trying all the different types of specialty pizzas... I have a feeling we will be dining here often!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  I'm from Chicago so used to the boring average pizza places around here and this is not one of them!  LOVE their pizzas! Salads could have more to them, but you can't go wrong with their pizzas!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great atmosphere. Legit pizza oven. Also fantastic place to host a private party with kids: they get to make their own pizzas."}
{"text":"The pizza place where you can order a slice and get 2!  Two slices is literally half a pizza!  The owners are wonderful people!  I will say I do miss the live music nights but overall a nice place in a trendy area!  Prices are reasonable!  They are located in Wexford by a market district in a nice little shopping plaza and plenty of parking!  The staff is always very friendly and food is prepared promptly!  You can choose from sweet or traditional sauce and plenty of toppings!  Wheat crust is also an option!  Stop in and see Gary and his crew for the best pizza in Wexford!"}
{"text":"Had a great gluten free pizza. Tried the pesto chicken, anything with pesto is a great idea in my book. This pizza didn't disappoint. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great food. People talk about burnt crust, you will have some dark spots with fire!  Our first time here we were a bit confused but caught on that you order and seat yourself. They call you when your order is done. There is also a place on the side where you can get all different types of toppings and get oil and spices to dunk your Crust!"}
{"text":"The Oven is a hometown favorite.   Great pizza with a variety of sauces, sweet, red, vodka, and white. Sweet is my go to, but they're all awesome. So next time your looking for pizza check this place out! Hint: Get balsamic house dressing to dip pizza crust in."}
{"text":"We had a great time.  The pizza we ordered was very fast and good. We sat outside and had a good meal. price wasn't too bad, and when we were there we got to try some different pizzas because of a special that was running.  we're looking forward to trying the winter pizza this winter.  It was a different pizza, not so oily, so that was nice."}
{"text":"I stopped into the The Oven Pizza Co. For a business lunch. Located in Wexford, I had heard about this place but had never had a chance to stop in.  It's unique in that you order your food right as you walk in.  There is a huge menu that hangs on the wall behind the cashier.  The other unique aspect of this place is that you can build your own pizza, all the way from the type of dough for the crust (wheat or white), to the type of sauce, and then of course to the types of toppings.  They have a decent lunch special, which is what I ordered. You can order a slice, which you can build, and you can choose from a bunch of different sides.  What I liked most about my pizza was the crust.  Really good! Just the right amount of crispness and a great flavor. The sauce (red) was better than most pizza places I visit.  Zesty and very flavorful.  I would definitely head back here for lunch again!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the basil, red sauce, tomatoes, and 4 cheese pizza that was the special for the month. I also really enjoy the thick consistency of their gelato. The service is good and the environment is interesting. The garage doors are open on nice days bringing the outdoor and indoor seating together. They have some garlic infused oil that was quite good. If you like brick oven flavored food, this is worth a try.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Solid place to grab a nice wood fired Pizza, my wife and I typically get the white chicken pizza with Spinach, however last evening they had a pulled pork pizza which was amazing as well.   

This is a great place to stop if you're planning on hitting up the Market District for some grocery shopping as they use fresh ingredients and we have through all iterations and name changes received fantastic service."}
{"text":"The pizza was terrible, the wings are OK. More importantly...

1. Upon entering I was informed that women like one kind of panini and men like another. Yes, GENDERED PANINIS. If this doesn't bother you, you'd probably also love their garbage pizza. 

2. They were playing Fox News - which I didn't realize until I was walking out, or I would have left before ordering anything. 

3. Possibly the most offensive - Pepsi products. 

I don't know how this place has such great ratings, but I would guess it's suburban phenomenon. If you are swinging through town from likely anywhere else, don't fall for it."}
{"text":"Most of the things I have had here are pretty tasty. I especially like the hummus pocket & mediterranean pocket. I see myself becoming a regular."}
{"text":"The Oven is a fantastic spot for lunch! I have been here several times and always enjoyed the experience. The ordering process is quick, and my food has always been ready promptly. You can build your own or order a specialty pizza. I have enjoyed both the Chicken Pesto and White Florentine. I also recommend getting the choose 2 option. Two slices of pizza with a side are plenty for me for lunch! Plus, I'd highly recommend going with either the side of hummus or the meatball as part of the choose 2."}
{"text":"a decent little pizza place.

+1 for fresh ingredients.  i had a slice of the basil, red sauce, and tomatoes pizza.  pizza for others in my party looked great.

+0 for decent salad.  $4 is a bit expensive for the small side salad that i had.  there wasn't much to it other than mixed greens and balsamic vinaigrette on the side.

-1 for prices that are a bit high.

+0 for no wait staff.

-1 for cleanliness.  we had to ask for our table to be wiped down.  an employee came over to clean it for us, and she left most of the crusty food on the table.

recommended to try once.  maybe it'll tickle your fancy more than it did mine."}
{"text":"Great woodfire pizza with creative and delicious topping combinations. Wings are fantastic - wood fired not  buffalo type. Very casual atmosphere, counter service only no wait staff. Wait for food can be long but the food tastes fresh so it's worth it. Serve beer & wine also and patio open in good weather - great local spot"}
{"text":"13\" perfect size for 2 people.. and you can have it made two-ways.. we had half the sweet-meat-heat and the other half wood-fired-meatball. Great! Wifi: theovenpizzaco"}
{"text":"The pizza was gooooood! Made fast enough, the crust was good, the actual pizza was good, I have no complaints at all. The guy who took the order was really friendly and when he saw us lingering over the gelato he came over and asked if we wanted samples. I like being offered without having to ask heh. Anyways, back to the pizza, it's not so big you can eat a good amount of a pie and take the rest home.

I liked the inside too cause of the big windows; it brings in a lot of sunlight which I really like. There's also outdoor seating if you wish. Also, I like places that are seat yourself! so I liked that.. just a personal preference note though hah.

I'm only giving it a four because they also have gelato which I wasn't too impressed with when I had the sample. Also, as I was walking in, it kind of looked cluttered and as if it was under construction in the front window. It was off-putting so.. yeah. But I like the pizza!"}
{"text":"Wow what amazing pizza and salads!!  Customers/friends claim thumbs up on other food as well.Came here on a 50th birthday party and had a blast...for being in a pizza shop. Clean everywhere, professional super attentive staff and Gary the owner is a pro....feeling like family royalty. Wonderful environment here @ the oven! ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"I have visited this business in this location and the others through all of it's name changes. I am unsure what the hate is all about. Both locations remain to serve solid, great food!

I first went to the \"new\" Oven Pizza Co when they hosted PghTweetup for us.

I was beyond impressed with the changes and improvements made. They actually know where their ingredients come from. They take pride in their food.

The changes they made are impressive for a partnership that didn't work out. In my opinion their food is a huge improvement from the previous names.

Of the 4 times I have been since the name change I have has several different pizzas, wings, a salad and i always get a smoothie or a root beer float."}
{"text":"Great brick oven pizza. 

On a whim I tried the wings and they turned out to be fantastic!  They oven roast them and use a dry rub that's super tasty."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times. The people who work there are nice. 
Value is an issue. 
You order at a counter seat yourself and have to walk back up to pick up your pizza. That's fine however the prices do not reflect the extremely casual atmosphere and self service approach. 
I had a whole buffalo chicken pizza in the past. Little chicken if at all. Not acceptable. 
Returned with some people again. 
This time ordered half or two pieces that was supposed to be $3 each or $6. Pepperoni was an extra .60 cents. Also ordered a \"glass\" of wine. It was two sips of wine. How did this all cost $15.00??? It's not worth the price. 
I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cute little wood-fired pizza place with a nice shaded outdoor patio that's dog friendly. They won us over with that last part because it's so tough to find a spot to take the doggies with you around here. We sat down & the dogs received a big water bowl. 

You order the pizza inside at the counter and they call your name over a speaker when it's ready. They also have beer and wine and varying specials throughout the week. The evening we were there, a jazz quartet was playing on the patio. 

Pizza was really good with a nice crispy crust and good quality ingredients. Nice little spot to spend an evening!"}
{"text":"Still very good pizza.  Don't get out this way much be we had a good lunch at TOPC. Have always been a fan of the pizza and today I had the Margarita.  Cooked perfectly with a nice crust.  You can get a whole 14 inch pizza or just slices.  Nice outdoor area but a little to cool to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Decent pizza -- freshly made. We had the vodka type with fresh roasted red peppers -- the peppers were fantastic , so sweet!-- the best I've ever had on a pizza! But, there wasn't enough flavor overall. It would have been fantastic with some fresh oregano! I also would have loved more cheese, or fresh mozzarella on the vodka type of pizza.

The place is huge, cool, and very clean. They have a wide variety of Gelato flavors: Chocolate, which was incredibly rich and delicious. And, my favorite: Honey Sunflower: wow! what a surprise! It was so fresh, so creamy, and so filled with the delight of honey! It reminds me so much of a Greens' Cookbook recipe for Honey Mousse (served with raspberries and figs). The Honey Sunflower Seed gelato made me dream of Summer! 

Though we had take-out, the customer service (which normally, you don't have a lot of during take-out), was fabulous. The young woman who waited on us was so friendly and helpful. When we got gelato to go, she put it in a cup holder. Awesome. 

I can see that Azzeria will become really popular in the future, particularly if they use more fresh basil or oregano and a bit more cheese, because of the freshness of their flavors, the friendliness of their staff, and the bright colorfulness (just what you need in winter!) of their restaurant.

Incidentally, besides the pizza and gelato, they serve salads, sandwiches, AND breakfast. Parking is easy since it's in a lot with lots of stores and the new Giant Eagle, and prices are moderate. Again, you can't go wrong with their gelato!"}
{"text":"I have visited this business for over 3 years now.  My favorite pizza is the Buffalo Chicken Pizza.  We stopped by recently and was surprised to see a name change.  They are now \"The Oven Pizza Co\".  A flyer on the door stated \"same great food, same great people\" along with a \"now hiring\" poster.

We ordered our usual.  At first glance, the pizza looked the same.  Well, except for the burnt crust.  But the taste was not the same.  The cheese tasted like soft plastic.  The chicken was dry and tasteless.  And there was no \"buffalo\" flavor.  And the whole wheat crust was tough and hard.  So sad about this pizza.  

Needless to say, we will not be giving them another chance."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a quick lunch. You order & pay when you come in and then you pick it up when your name is announced. The pizza is okay, but the best option in my opinion are the panini's. The Chicken Ranch is my favorite. It's very filling, reasonably priced, and you also get a side choice with it. The dining area is open, and if it's nice out it opens to outdoor seating."}
{"text":"My husband and I actually ate here two weekends in a row - it was that good! Pizzas are delicious and the crust is perfect (not too thick, not too thin). I'm only giving it 4 stars because we felt crammed at our table (it was very crowded as it was Friday night, there was only one table left!) our small salad was $4.50 - seems a bit over priced for what you get, and our pizza took a little while, but it was worth the wait. We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This pizza is SO good! They have delicious gluten-free options, especially their gluten-free pizza crust. I've had a number of their specialty pizzas, but I think the Honey Pie is the best. The bread sticks are really good too!"}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars. Love the wood fired pizza dough all the way to the crust.  That part is a 4 or 5 star.  My faves are the pulled pork and the meatball.  The sweet meat heat is also good.  

My husband said he liked the wings, but they were just ok to me.  They're a little intimidating because they look charred, but it's not actually overcooked.  It's dry rubbed and oven fired, and you choose your dipping sauce/s.  I think the ranch dressing they gave me last time was spoiled, so maybe that's what spoiled the wings to me :/

My hubby got the double meatball to try and we thought it was ok.  They forgot to give us the flatbread that comes with it, so I can't comment on that.

I can see how customers might be unsatisfied with the toppings.  Some pizzas, like the meatball, seem to have evenly spread toppings.  Others, like the sweet meat heat and pulled pork seem to lack meat/toppings.  You can end up with a slice that only has cheese and sriracha.

The place seems small but they have their outdoor seating open during the warmer seasons.  Workers are nice, but it's tough to decipher the names they're calling out on the intercom sometimes."}
{"text":"Azzeria is more than just pizza. They also have a good selection of pannini, salads, smoothies, and gelato.

The pizza and pannini are wood-fired and they have many toppings that are wood-fired as well. I had the white pizza with fire roasted red peppers and ricotta cheese. It was very good! The crust was chewy and crisp, yet light. 

The gelato is made locally and comes in tons of different flavors. I had the traditional pistachio and it was fantastic. 

They also have homemade soups.
