{"text":"Average sushi, with weak service. It isn't an inviting atmosphere and you can get so much more for the same or even less $ in terms of the sushi spots in AZ. If you do go here, pick Sunday as that is their deal day."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years. The quality of the food has certainly gone down hill as has the service.  The restaurant is located in the back of a dumpy mall.  The restaurant has no ambience. The food used to be okay, but I'm not sure that the food is even that fresh.  Receiving a plate of room temperature sushi is never very appetizing.  The waitresses run around like chickens with their heads cut off by day.  By night, they bring in some low motivation waitresses that must be cutting their teeth at waitressing - horrible service, inattentive, etc.   The sushi chefs are without personality.   There are such good sushi places in Scottsdale, why waste your time on this one that tries so little."}
{"text":"Sushi ko is wonderful. It is my favorite sushi restaurant in town. It's tucked back in the corner of the complex and a hidden gem. We love the noodle udon, Philadelphia tempura rolls, miso soup and edamame. Staff are helpful and friendly and it is fun to join them up at the sushi bar as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Usually I don't put much weight into other's reviews that knock the service at any establishment. Usually my own experience differs vastly from those who knock the service so nonetheless I decided to give this place a chance since it's down the street from my house. Went there 2 weeks ago with 3 other people and we had to seat ourselves. After seating ourselves in a very visible booth directly in front of the sushi bar, we had to wait over 30 minutes for the staff to \"greet\" us and take our drink orders. Not exactly good service. The food was good and I chalked it up to a bad night for the wait staff.   With the food being pretty good, my favorite place to get authentic cold noodles, so I figured I'd try it again the following week... BIG mistake! We were seated this time upon arrival, but that was the only positive. Again we waited 40 minutes for anyone to even make eye contact let alone take our drink orders. Keep in mind both times I've went there it was only half full at best, so in no way was the staff too busy to notice. Throughout the entire evening.. And I mean 2.5 hours!!! We had to tell the waitress what we wanted and if we wanted more water, sake, sushi, dessert, etc. Not once did she ask us for anything! By the way, don't even try to exchange your Yelp voucher.. She looked like she'd never seen it before and only took $10 off.. Which is what I paid.. And me trying to explain to her that it should be $20 off added about 20 minutes to already the longest trip to a sushi bar that I've ever had. Food-wise I'd give this joint a 4, the food isn't the issue. But the service is an absolute joke and I'll never go back. This is the only place that I've experienced service so bad that I'd never go back! Besides, Hiro Sushi is right down the street and the service is 1000x better!  Sorry for the long review, but I guarantee I just saved you some time and the longest, most ridiculous sushi experience you've ever had if you were thinking of trying this place out!"}
{"text":"2nd visit here and 2nd time receiving horrible service. Our cups of green tea were empty our entire meal, service is slow, and mediocre quality. Much better places in the valley. I will not be coming back for a third try.I love to support local businesses but this one needs some improvement."}
{"text":"The restaurant was tucked in a back corner of a very quiet strip mall ... can be hard to find if you are not actually looking for it. Ordered some nigiri and rolls ... was A-OK ... fish is not exactly fresh and the sushi rice doesn't has enough favor to it. I would give the food a passing grade of 3 stars   But the service and atmosphere took away a star to make it two ... as soon as you walked in, I am not sure if it's the decor or the feng shui in this restaurant ... the energy is just so low that you can see that on the tired sushi chefs' face and spotty memory staffs' action ... not only one of the order was forgotten, we have to remind them to go get the change for our bill .... ~_~"}
{"text":"I'm really disappointed on my visit to this great tasting sushi establishment. The service here on a Wednesday evening was absolutely horrendous. We only got drinks because the waitress forgot us. Really in the mood for sushi, but it was a no go."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sushi Ko for the last 10 years, once or twice a month, always at lunch time. Sushi is always fresh and tasty. Their lunch specials prices are very reasonable. The servers are very polite and strive to get your order to you on a timely basis although it seems they are under-staffed at busy times. I usually get the sashimi combination lunch special. Included is cucumber salad, miso soup and a bowl of rice.  There is a minimum of 16 pieces of 4 different kinds of fish. All for $14. Great deal!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is hidden away in the corner of a busy strip mall near Chompie's.  Happy hour is Sun-Thu 5pm-6pm, when all sushi (non-market priced nigiris not makis) on the menu are 50% off.  Most items are $4-$5.  The highest price item is amaebi (raw sweet shrimp) $7, which was huge and very fresh.  The head is served deepfried which is better than any french fry.  I also like the oysters with ponzu sauce."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I would put it up against a lot of other sushi in town for a pepsi challenge face off.  The Nigiri is amazing and the portions of fish are generous.  Prices are fair but don't expect this to be on the cheaper end of the spectrum.  The fish comes from all over the world and tastes fresh every time.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the worst customer service experience at this restaurant. We waited for our food for 45 minutes while other tables got their food even though they ordered after us. The bill was calculated incorrectly and the waitress couldn't figure out how to remove an over charge. The food is OK nothing special considering how many other sushi restaurants we have in Scottsdale. I'm sure the food would have tasted better if the staff had been at least courteous. I will not return again."}
{"text":"Meh. It was OK. Wayyyy too much mayo on top of one of the special rolls. Fortunately they let us have happy hour pricing 10minutes before it ended. Otherwise I would have given it two stars. Recommended by a friend, she must have had something else. At least the sushi tasted somewhat fresh."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat Sushi about once a week.  This is our absolute favorite place for Sushi.  Everything we order is wonderful.  I'm perplexed by the bad reviews given here on Yelp.  Not so good for the owner, but good for those of us who love Sushi Ko.  Depending on what time you go, it can get very crowded.  Some of our favorite dishes are the Salmon Skin Salad, the Yellow Tail Sashimi, the Soft Shell Crab Appetizer, and the Sushi Ko Roll.  I can not say enough good things about Sushi Ko!"}
{"text":"What a great little hidden gem!  Fresh & delicious & authentic.  The waitstaff is very attentive & Eric at the Sushi bar is fantastic!  Love this place..."}
{"text":"Ugh. There are far better sushi places in Phoenix for the same price that you need to pay here.  First off, if you are looking for Shabu Shabu, I would not recommend it here. Our server was completely unhelpful, and seemed so impatient trying to explain how the Shabu Shabu works. The more questions we asked, the more annoyed she became. Definitely big red flag already!  Basically in the menu, Shabu Shabu only offers you 1 option. Thinly sliced beef with assorted veggies (some greens, noodles, mushrooms). All this for $30!!!!  When we got the dish, I was shocked at how lean the meat was. The cut was no good at all, I felt like I was at some cheap chinese buffet getting ready to eat at the Mongolian BBQ grilling station.  The veggies were alright, but I felt the broth was a bit too salty.  We ordered some sushi too, but didn't feel that unique to me.  I was quite disappointed in this restaurant, given the fact that it's in such a nice area of town."}
{"text":"good shabu shabu. their crab legs tempura is really good. overall sushi quality is good. service is just ok."}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood go to place for delicious, fresh sushi. I feels homey, not pretentious. The sushi chefs are Japanese as they should be for top notch sushi. We have been dining here for 6 or 7 years now and the food is always good. It is more traditional, not a lot of fancy rolls, just fresh and delicious sushi!"}
{"text":"shabu shabu! much fun and delicious!  They cook the dish at your table with generous portions and fresh ingredients.  Serves 3 to 4... Service was fun and very friendly!"}
{"text":"While mindful of the wisdom: \"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\", I admit to trying this place three times.    Attended first visit two years ago as an invited guest of others.  I remember food being acceptable but service glacially slow, ineffective and impersonal.  It's all perfectly described in other reviews.  Second visit could be better described as an attempt.  Showed up without reservations on a busy night, was told by person presumed to be hostess that was ok and to wait a minute for table to be cleared.  After standing by with other unacknowledged patrons for 15 long minutes we were then addressed by a different person who, obviously under stress, communicated like the White House Chief of Staff announcing the shooting of the President at a press conference (seen that) and told us we were not going to get a table in the foreseeable future without a reservation.  Bye-bye.   Went back last night with dear-old Mom, who wished to redeem a gift card.  Read other reviews, if you still are reading, for gift card experiences of others we experienced.  I made reservations.  Was shown to our table immediately upon arrival by the hostess.  White House Chief of Staff imitator from last visit was our server. A real master of defensive behavior wrapped into a disguise of hospitality, the first things she demanded to know upon approaching the table was why we had no menus, and why were we sitting at a table labeled \"reserved\" (\"Hello\" must be out of vogue). She didn't believe our story about having reservations and double checked with the hostess.  I'll quit with that and spare you the rest.   Sushi not very fresh (yes, I am conscious of the fact we are in the desert) and batter on tempura was like the coating found on cheap, supermarket deli food.  Yuk.   I crack up reading the four star reviews.  Even they had problems.   You guys get out much?    Strike three, you're out, Sushi Ko."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on a Monday night and the place had a few other people eating, but otherwise empty. We ordered spicy tuna, California and Philly rolls. We felt like it was very average sushi. Also ordered the chicken wings, which did not match the menu description of asian flavored wings, instead came out as normal buffalo wings. Only 5 in the order for $6. Would not come again or recommend."}
{"text":"Sushi - 4 stars Service - 2 stars  Ordered some rolls to go from Sushi Ko.  Told that it would be an hour or so.  Asked the person who took order to double check if it would really be an hour.  She checked and said it would be \"like half an hour or so\".    Go to pick up the rolls half an hour later.  Check and see that all the avocado in my rolls is brown.    Me:  Can they redo the rolls with green avocado.   Sushi chef: Avocado in those rolls is supposed to be brown.   Me: I've never had brown avocado rolls before; can you remake them? Sushi chef: These rolls have been ready for 20 minutes, if you had gotten here earlier they would not be brown.   Me: Well it's a good thing I showed up now b/c originally I was told an hour. (in my head I'm thinking \"What is the story?  Is it that avocado in rolls is supposed to be brown or that I didn't show up soon enough?  Either way - I'm not eating these!!!) Sushi chef: Fine we will remake them.  Take rolls home.  Sushi is okay, not good, but okay.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"We thought the food was fabulous & the service was great!  My sashimi was fresh, the tempura was light & not at all greasy.  My husband had pork katsu which he devoured.  We'll definitely be going back to this quaint neighborhood restaurant!"}
{"text":"We had dinner tonight at Sushi Ko and the sushi was fantastic. We will go back again and again to fully explore the menu!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Mark P. and Kristen S. I decided to check out this restaurant based on their reports. This is my first time in Scottsdale AZ and I wanted to go to a Japanese restaurant without the glitz or glam.   To find Sushi Ko (from 101):  I suggest turning right on N 92nd St and then turn left into the shopping center (look for Starbucks and Quiznos). You'll see Chompie's sign...you can't miss that one. To the right of that establishment, you need to take a very short walk down an alley and there's Sushi Ko. You will not see this restaurant from the parking lot route.   I went to Sushi Ko on Sunday on or about 7:15 PM and I was immediately seated. There were 2 sushi chefs (one Japanese and one Mexican). The sushi bar was filled so I took a small table. Upon sitting, I noticed two bottles of soy sauce (one at full strength...and the other with low sodium).   Since this was my first time here, I ordered enough food to sample their cuisine. Here's my dinner order:  1. Yakko Tofu (cold tofu): The tofu was fresh and served perfectly cold. The seasoning was also good. It could have used some bits/strips of nori (seaweed). The cube of tofu is small (3 x 3). For the price and size, I felt it was a little bit much...should be $2.75, not $3.50. I know...that's petty, but it's important to note if you order this.   2. Beef Teriyaki (dinner): The miso soup has bits of tofu and soft seaweed. The flavour was very good...not too salty. The dinner salad was good, but a little too much salad dressing for me. Ask for it on the side. The beef teriyaki was served with short 1-inch spears of asparagus, a slice of potato, slices of carrot, and 1 broccoli crown. The beef is served on a hot plate, but it's important to request for your specific cooking preference (rare, medium rare, medium). Otherwise, the steak will come out medium. If the hot plate is sizzling, your steak may be slightly well-done. There is enough teriyaki sauce to enjoy your meal. And, if all else fails, ask for more.  :)  Of course, eating at a Japanese restaurant is not complete without some sushi.   3. 4 pcs of Salmon (Sake) Nigiri: The salmon was fresh and not fishy tasting. The natural oil of the fish was perfect. The slices of salmon were very generous and thick. The sushi rice was fair. It needs a little more rice vinegar to sharpen the taste.   4. 4 pcs of Yellowtail (Hamachi) Nigiri: The yellowtail was also fresh and not fishy tasting. It was not as smooth or \"buttery\" in texture which is essential to yellowtail. The slices were also very generous and thick. The sushi rice was fair. It needs a little more rice vinegar to sharpen the taste.   5. 2 pcs of Eel (Unagi) Nigiri: I absolutely loved the way this was prepared...the Unagi was grilled leaving a crispy edge. The flavour was very good and in spite of the sushi rice...it did not diminish the overall taste.   6. 6 pcs Salmon Roll (Sake Maki): The salmon was excellent (as stated above in Nigiri format), but the sushi rice is what didn't pull this through. The surrounding nori was a little too soft, and should be a little crisper.   My overall dinner cost was $54.00 including a soft drink.     The meal above is really for two people, but whenever I try a new restaurant...it's important to order a lot so that you can get a better spectrum of the cuisine.   By in large, I really enjoyed this restaurant. The staff was very friendly, attentive, and cordial. I even had an opportunity to talk to the chef who grilled my steak.  :)  This \"whole-in-the-wall\" restaurant is great. It is indeed much more preferable than the other Japanese restaurants that have loud music, loud tvs, fusion, and drinking atmospheres. If you want to go and have a nice quiet Japanese dinner, this is an excellent choice.   Thank you for your time!  Bon Appetit!  :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good the couple of times I've been there! They have a couple of decent combinations that they offer for $10 that gives you a number of choices."}
{"text":"The service at Sushi Ko was terrible.  Our waitress was rude.  I think we were inconveniencing her by needing things like tea or plates or sushi...  We tried to get her attention, then we tried to get anyone's attention to bring us plates and little bowls for our soy sauce.  We eventually retrieved our own plates.  When we asked about the bowls for soy sauce, we were told they \"were out\", even though we could see a little stack of them in the restaurant.  The sushi itself was acceptable, if forgettable.  We had a rainbow roll, spicy something or other, and tuna sashimi. The rolls were a little loose and hard to eat.    I won't be eating there again unless they make some staffing changes."}
{"text":"Great hidden sushi spot. The fish is always fresh and they have the best green tea. They just redid their bar so nice spot to grab a drink too."}
{"text":"Sushi Ko has recently changed both its lunch and dinner menus for the worse.  I imagine it's an attempt to save money, but I'd have much prefered its old menu and higher prices.  A warning to those who remember their excellent Happy Hour with sushi at half price.  That Hour no longer exists, replaced by a very unhappy choice of dishes."}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick go-to sushi restaurants when I am meeting friends in that area.    The restaurant aesthetically and general ambiance is nothing to right home about by any stretch of the imagination, but it is comfortable, quick, and most importantly, reliable for good sushi.   Two things I love on the menu -   Sushi Ko roll - baked rock shrimp, scallops, and crab over a spice tuna roll.  It is not fried, but served warm.  It is a satisfying meld of flavors and textures. I dare anyone not to love it!  Sashimi Salad - Tuna over mostly lettuce. I ask for it with the Sushi Ko House dressing instead of the special soy dressing. Makes a huge difference.  The sushi chefs are very accommodating if you want to make changes.  Yesterday I asked if I could have the Red Snapper (my new favorite fish)instead of the tuna in the sashimi salad. It was heavenly! It was served with heaps of the red snapper on the plate, a rarity in a sushi restaurant.  Are there more innovative sushi restaurants in the area? Absolutely.  But there is a reason Sushi Ko has been around for fifteen years -- no frills, reliably fresh and moderately priced -- it will always be on my dining repertoire!"}
{"text":"We are addicted to this place!  Best sushi in Scottsdale.  Very hidden but a great find. In back near Chompies.   Try the salmon sashimi the yellowtail belly it's like butter melts in your mouth. Sea bass is amazing too. Even the ginger dressing on the side salad is amazing."}
{"text":"Awful. Went last night and ordered vodka/soda and rum/coke, both with lemons. Indifferent server needed tutorial on soda water and conferred with sushi chef.She also added that she \"wasn't a bartender and that she didn't drink\" She then inquired as to type of vodka and I stated bar was fine, and a double as well. She returned w/ a glass of soda; no vodka or lemon. She left to bring rum/ coke, but returned 5 min later w coke no rum, and no lemon. We saw this was going downhill quickly so we cut our losses, and left for another local sushi place. No need to bother coming here."}
{"text":"Best time to come here is during lunch. I always get the lunch special or the chirashi. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner with a couple of friends.  The sushi is ok and the service is awful.  I ordered Miso soup and my friends ordered the octopus salad to start.  My soup came out and I finished it well before their octopus salad came out.  When it finally did, we had no plates.  Waited 5 minutes and not only did our waitress never come by our table, neither did any others.  Finally had to walk up to the sushi bar and grab 3 plates.   We ordered sashimi and 3 rolls.  Took FOREVER.  This place sucks for ambiance so you don't just want hang out and have a leisurely meal here.  Alas, that's what we ended up doing.  I felt depressed when we finally did leave due to the terrible light, decor and well...everything.    After our sashimi and rolls came out we had to flag down our waitress again and ask for soy sauce dishes.  She said they were out.  Out?  How is that possible?  Walk your lazy ass to the back and wash 3 for us!  Seriously.  So I pointed to the 3 empty place settings at the sushi bar that had sauce dishes and asked, \"So those 3 aren't available either?\"  She did go and grab them for us.  The sashimi was pretty good, but the rolls sucked.  They were lacking in any real flavor and weren't rolled correctly so they kept falling apart.  I actually just gave up and left hungry.  No point in consuming calories I'm not enjoying.  In a nutshell, this place really kinda blows.  I have no idea how they are still open.  I wouldn't recommend it nor will I be returning."}
{"text":"I came here with a Groupon.  I'd guess it's the only way they can get customers to come to this place.  Unfortunately the salad and miso soup were the highlight of the meal (see pic).  The chicken katsu was horrible...super greasy and over a bed of plain, gummy white rice.  Took two bites and had them take the rest away.  My Philadelphia roll was HOT.  Yes. I've never had hot sushi before, but there is a reason, and it is because it is absolutely disgusting.  And it was cooked salmon.  Ate one piece and had them take the rest away.  I ordered a mixed drink which has 3 ingredients.  My server promised they knew how to make it, and when I received it, it was clearly made with a mixture of alcohols, even though only one type is used in the drink.  When I tried to pay with the groupon, I was told I didn't spend enough (total $28 of $30 spent).  The server demanded I buy something else or else I couldn't use the groupon, despite my explaining that I absolutely did NOT expect to receive any money back.  Bought another shitty roll and left that there.  Never again."}
{"text":"Sushi Ko is your typical overpriced Japanese restaurant.  A bunch of my friends had shabu shabu, and it looked okay, except that it was $30 an order (enough for two people), and consisted of about 3/4 vegetables and 1/4 meat.  No thanks - I'll take a hotpot at home any day.  I opted for the ebi fry.  A bowl of lukewarm, salty miso soup, a bowl of salad with miso dressing, a small bowl of rice, 4 shrimp and 2 small onion rings for $18.  If you think that's a good deal, you're insane in the membrane.  Our waitress was okay, but she had a seemingly tough time explaining how many people each order of shabu shabu would feed (honestly, I think she was just trying to get us to get more orders of shabu shabu).  She was pretty friendly though throughout our meal, and did a decent job of checking on us every once in a while.  The restaurant is pretty small and is tucked away in the corner (literally).  I only found it because I stopped inside the shopping center to text a friend for the location, and happened to spot a few getting out of their cars.  After parking, getting out of my car, and walking towards my friends, I still couldn't see where the restaurant was.  What a horrible location.  Mediocre and expensive food + horrible location = no thanks.  At least we got some entertainment afterwards out in the parking lot (thanks G!)."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet sushi place. The fish is always fresh and the servers are all professional and friendly. Also, it's nice having a go-to for sushi on Mondays when most independent sushi joints are closed. Naomi Garnice gives it four stars!"}
{"text":"Whod'a thunk, a fantastic shabu shabu place in AZ?!!!  I love shabu shabu and am always on the hunt for a good one when I travel.  I found this place through the reviews here and oh my, it was way yum.  It wasn't as good as some of the other places I've tried in San Francisco but definitely up there.  This restaurant has a combination of sushi, other standard fare and shabu shabu.  I was there strictly for the shabu.  They sat me at a HUGE booth and I wondered about that until I got all my food.  Oh my, it did take up the entire table and it was just me!  It's a ton of food between the sliced beef and the vegetables and the hot pot, there was no way I would finish everything.  I dug in.  The sauces that came with the meal was mouthwatering good.  The only improvement I would suggest to them would be to slice the beef a tad thinner but other than that, the food and the service was pretty spectacular.  Warning, the shabu shabu platter is a TON of food and well worth the $30.  I would definitely recommend splitting the meal with someone, I left most of the veggies uneaten because I wanted to make sure I ate all the good stuff first."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and have always meant to write a review but never got around to it.  Well, since I've moved out to the boonies in Gilbert I haven't been for a while.  I stopped in recently for lunch and decided and I'd finally commit and write the review.  This is one of my favorite sushi spots in the valley.  They always have a great selection on the specials menu and the fish is always very fresh and perfectly prepared.  I usually sit at the sushi bar so I can only speak to the service there.  They are prompt and very, very friendly.  There's often some other people at the bar who seem to be regulars and on a first name basis.  The have an awesome happy hour, but it is only from 5-6.  No drink specials but it's half off all nigiri.  Sometimes they will even extend that to items on the specials board.  It's a steal.  I've had several cooked items, mostly off the specials board.  They all rocked.   Between starting this review and finishing it I drove here all the way from Gilbert for dinner with family that was in from out of town.  It was worth the drive.  I tried a new dish- chunks of cucumber with salted plum.  Totally amazing and under three dollars.  I highly recommend it.  Umeboshi (Japanese plum) is sour and wonderful.  If you've never had it this dish is a great intro to it.  I sat at a table this time and the service was good, even though it was totally packed.  It was Friday around 7:30 and I had to wait approx 15 min for a seat.  After reading my fellow yelpers I can't wait to go back and try the shabu shabu."}
{"text":"My husband and I visit Sushi Ko pretty regularly.  It's small, family owned and everyone that works there is friendly.  The food is consistently great. Our favorites are the shumai, the toro sashimi and the sushi Ko roll."}
{"text":"My go to place for excellent sushi.  No frills, but clean and comfortable.  The food outshines any sushi in AZ. I've had sushi all over the country and this is truly top tier. The sushi chefs and wait staff are amazing. If you want authentic Japanese food where Japanese people eat, this is the place to go.  My mom is Japanese and this is her favorite place too- and she has very particular taste.  Enjoy!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to sushi restaurant for lunch.   Their sushi is always fresh and wait service is always great.   I always order the sashimi lunch special which is very reasonable and incredibly filling.    They serve a ginger dressing there that is my favorite ginger dressing  (I love it so much that i always order a bottle of it to bring home with me).   If you like ginger dressing, try my ginger and rice concoction when you visit Sushi Ko.   Combine one small bowl of rice with one small bowl of ginger dressing, mix it thoroughly and enjoy! My friends are all hooked on it!   I eat it with sashimi - yummy flavor explosion!   I highly recommend this place for sushi :)"}
{"text":"If I'm going to pay for a nice sushi dinner, I'd go somewhere else. The sushi and sashimi were decent, but came to the table warm. That was wierd."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant. Laud back feel. Not super fancy. Great Japanese sushi chefs, fresh fish and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love this tiny place. Great saki selection and terrific sushi! Try the eel cucumber rolls, they are to die for! This place is definately good for people wanting a quiet restaurant not for those wanting a RA or Kona Grill type of scene."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for a few years now and have never had a bad experience. Their rolls are bigger than any other place I've been, and the quality is top of the line, for the same price as RA. Sushi Ko is the most authentic and best tasting Sushi in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It's a bit old fashioned and not a big variety of rolls.  The place was dead when we visited which didn't help the ambiance. Overall the rolls had little flavor and were bland. It wasn't bad but i don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"Good sushi gets busy fast though so get there early if you want a table. If you get thee a little later in the evening it is still worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have been thinking that today is Saturday all day long. But inherently I know today is Sunday because yesterday was Saturday, and yesterday's events looked much different than today's, but still, all day long, it felt like Saturday. Imagine my surprise when I went to dinner and found out at a tiny, Sushi-dive that it was indeed Sunday.   I walked in and, I am shocked because, again, I am thinking that it is Saturday night and I am one of only five or six Guests in this place at 5:45 p.m!   I ask for the Sushi bar and they hand me my sushi menu and a pencil and stamped across the menu says something to the effect \"Sushi Happy Hour - Sunday thru Thursday - 5 - 6 p.m. - Nigiri\" It's Sunday night and its before 6 p.m., SCORE!  I order hot tea, spicy scallop, uni, roe and quail egg; and for dessert I ordered freshwater eel - my tab - less than $14.   Outside of the sushi chef, my service was non-existent (which is why I love, love, love Sakana), all the same, Sushi Ko was a nice little find on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"The hard part is finding it.  I just happened to be looking the right direction and caught a glimpse of it hiding back in the corner of the shopping center. Very good quality food and service.  I would go back in a heart-beat. My goal in life is to get there early enough for the lower prices so I can really pig out!"}
{"text":"This place is OK I guess. The fish is fresh but not a big variety.  There are many other OK sushi bars in Scottsdale if you want ok sushi and no personality from the sushi chefs and servers go here. If you want ok sushi and at least the fun interaction that is part of the sushi experience go to one of the other ok sushi places. BUT if you want great sushi and fun go to Sakana's not to far from here and have the total package"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about Sushi Ko. A regular group from work and I go at least once a week and sometimes as much as 3 times a week for lunch. The specials are great and the quality of the food is always excellent.   If you are looking for a glam-type of sushi bar that serves dozens of western rolls then go to Ra.... but if you want tasty, reasonably priced AUTHENTIC sushi then Sushi Ko is the place!"}
{"text":"Descent Japanese food with a good menu. We have been going there for years and even our Japanese friends liked it. Try the sushi bar with your partner or a booth with a bigger group. Service can be a little slow depending on the server, but you will like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim after an appointment for a roll. Found parking and walked in only to be told that they are closed.  PLEASE UPDATE YOUR YELP HOURS which show that you are OPEN right now not CLOSED."}
{"text":"I echo the service problems of other reviewers! Went for dinner and there were maybe three other tables that were full, but by the lack of service, you'd think the place was packed! I couldn't tell who was supposed to be helping me. Random people kept walking by who seemed to work there, but then would sit down at the tables and eat and talk? Guy who seated us asked us our drink order, then seemed baffled by my request for a wine list. When he couldn't find one, I asked for Sapporo beer, and again, he was totally baffled by this. Food came out randomly, but the weirdest part was when I tried to order dessert. I asked for chocolate mochi, but was told chocolate was \"seasonal.\" What?? Really? Not returning."}
{"text":"First time tonight, and it was awesome! Super good rolls and the yellowtail sashimi was fresh. Also the staff are super nice and the food comes out in a timely manner. Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great for a date night or when out with friends. The sushi is the best I've had in AZ. The atmosphere is very casual and quaint. The staff is always very friendly and attentive. I will definitely keep coming here and would highly recommend to other sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, I regret not rating it long ago. It's been a favorite of ours for years. Good food at a good price. We usually start with the mushroom appetizer, it's very good. Salads are fresh and tasty and then the typical selection of rolls plus a few specials. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Nice little sushi joint tucked away into a recessed corner of this strip mall. I went on a weeknight and it was almost full (a good sign). I was very hungry so I ordered one of those sushi combo's we often see on menu's these days.I was still a little uncertain if it would all fill me up. I was full before I even got to my tuna roll.  The roll was fantastic by the way. It had a generous portion of tuna as opposed to some tuna rolls I have had at  Sushi restaurants where the tuna is no thicker than a pencil (90% rice - 10% tuna). Sushi Ko's roll was more like 60% rice and 40% tuna. The service was very fast and friendly but not overbearing. I will be back."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place - fantastic sushi at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is a little funky - but in a wierd way it works. We love their volcano roll - which a special but is quite frequently on the board.  A lot of people don't know about it because it's tucked away into a corner (next to Chompie's) - but for that reason it makes it seem more like a hidden gem. It's never over crowded (I don't think I've ever had to wait for a table) and the service is always great."}
{"text":"I had the sushi lunch special which was a salad, miso soup, and a 4 piece nigiri plate with a spicy roll. I added to that an order of nigiri salmon, and an order of salmon roe with quail egg. All was very good except for the salmon roe. They seemed old...a bit shriveled and on the dry side. I have had several meals there before that we're top notch...but this time I was put off by the salmon roe. That aside, I was pleased overall. The rest tasted and smelled fresh and well cared for. I will go back. They have been the best sushi bar in the area that I have found."}
{"text":"Went here twice and both times the service was pretty bad. It took forever to get our orders in and forever to get our food out. I think the place is understaffed or something. However, the servers themselves are really nice though when they stop by and make small chat. I just think there is not enough servers on the floor so everyone ends up waiting for a long time.   It also amazes me how both times I went, the restaurant was incredibly packed. My roommate guessed that most of the patrons there were people who didn't want to wait for Hiro Sushi down the street.   As for the food, it was disappointing for what you pay. The quality of my chicken katsu dinner was so bad. The chicken made my mouth sad. I'm pretty sure I'm never going here again.  If you have any other choices for sushi when you are in the N. Scottsdale area, which you do, I would suggest you try there before here."}
{"text":"Came here because we had a gift certificate from an online deal- very hard to find tucked back between two buildings in the corner of the shopping center. The staff members are rude to eachother and loud so you can hear them even when they're back in the kitchen- really kills atmosphere. Sat at our table for 5-10 minutes before we were greeted (waitress did apologize for leaving us sitting there so long).  I liked the edamame, miso soup & tempura were pretty good, but the main course (beef teriyaki & sushi) were average at best which is not saying much for a sushi place. Restaraunt was dirty inside, thick layers of dust on almost anything you looked at- all light fixtures, booths, walls, wood trim... makes you wonder how clean the kitchen is if they don't clean the places you _do_ actually see. Highlight was our waitress, very knowledgeable about the menu, and very sweet & genuine, if not for her, this probably would've been a 1 star."}
{"text":"Okay sushi place. I went there around 8pm and all the fried foods I ordered tasted like burnt oil. I had a baked salmon that was pretty good though. It wasn't busy but the wait staff were extremely slow and seemed discontented. I don't normally eat here because Hiro Sushi a couple minutes away is way better in terms of food quality and staff but the happy hour here is pretty good for cheap sushi."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch. Their lunch menu is not expensive and it tastes great. They seem to be dedicated to great service. I usually come here once a week."}
{"text":"Not the worst service I've ever had, but could use improvements. As far the food, holy crap!! Super yummy. I got the yakisoba lunch special-- comes with 2 gyoza and some banging fried rice. Lots of food and I was very pleased. My boyfriend got the sushi and thought it was average--it's arizona, what do you expect! Lunch special-- yes! Sushi-- take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Fresh, amazing sushi. One of my favorite spots in the valley! Their lobster tempura is amazing. The atmosphere is great and the service is outstanding. I'm glad it's so close by!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent selection of Japanese classics.. Udon, sushi, tempura etc.. all are done decent enough and is priced well.. but for me this place is missing something. Seriously I cant put my finger on it.. maybe because the service is a little on the rude side at the tables rather then at the sushi bar?   They have half priced sushi happy hour which is very cool! Thanks Helen, you've opened many doors for me!!"}
{"text":"The $10 for $20 deal is what prompted us to eat here for lunch one day, and it was well worth it! Seeing all the reviews that talked about the poor service, I was a little apprehensive but figured, what the hell!  The hostess was very polite as she sat us, and our server was great! She had our drinks and our soups and edamame out to us in no time.   We ordered the sashimi platter, the Ichi Roll and the Eel Cucumber roll, and there were no complaints! $13.95 for a good sized platter of sashimi is a hell of a deal. I rarely order sashimi because most places want $15 for 5 or 6 pieces of mediocre fish. For $14 I got 6-8 pieces of 4 different types of fish: yellowtail, salmon, tuna and a marinated fish that tasted almost like Hawaiian poke, but I couldn't tell you what it was. It was damn good though. The fish was fresh and flavourful.   The Ichi Roll has spicy tuna, crab and seabass, topped with tempura flakes. It was cool, light and refreshing. Perfect for a warm day!   For the eel and cucumber roll, I actually subbed out the cucumber for avocado, and I'd absolutely recommend the swap! Get it with eel sauce and tempura flakes, for crunch, and it's amazing.   So I'm not sure what the circumstances were behind those who had poor service, but that was definitely NOT our experience. We'll definitely be back, especially if they have more deals to take advantage of! But even without the coupon, we've absolutely found a new lunch spot."}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and decided to stop in and have some sushi one evening and was very amazed by the service I received and the food was outstanding. Just want to say my waiter was a very friendly young man that never made me wait on anything and always made sure my drink was topped off. I will definitely be back whenever I return to this area again!!! I can say that Sushi Ko is at the top of my list on best places to get great Sushi"}
{"text":"I genuinely feel bad writing a negative review about this restaurant because I totally get it... being a server in a badly run, poorly designed restaurant sucks. It's not the server's fault but.. still.. this place sucks.  Ambience: in a word? Awkward. It was nearly empty on a Saturday night. Probably because it's stuck way in the back corner next to a chiropractor's office. The lighting is much like a doctor's office, overly bright in an artificial way. The music is canned muzac... again like a doctor's office. And the layout of the place is terrible. The sushi station is in the center with a small bar and the booths line the way facing the bar. So basically the booth people are staring at the back of your head if you're at the bar. There are a few random tables on either side of this strangeness.   Service: Clueless. Was the guy who seated us our server? Or is the sushi guy our server? Who do we order drinks with? Who do we order hot food/sushi from? So confusing. They seemed just as confused as us because when we ordered from the sushi guy, he clearly was annoyed and said he'd \"Take care of it\"... uh ok.. thanks? Then we ordered some hot food which... never came. Until I asked for it, which of course was too late.   Food: Good enough, but not good enough for me to come back.   I don't know how Sushi Ko stays in business considering how they're hiding in the corner of the Chompie's shopping center, especially with such poor service and atmosphere. Pretty much what I'm saying is, go to Hiro Sushi down the street and just endure the wait. They have a wait because they're good at what they do."}
{"text":"We really were hoping to find a great sushi place in our area.  We have favorites in other cities but yet to find anything here......definitely no place that is open past 9, which is odd for a \"big\" city.  Gave one star for good food.  Wish we would have been given the time to enjoy it..........if not for the bad service experiences, would have given 3 or 4 against others in the area.  We tried this place and really liked the food.  The service was ok the first eve. we were there......which was Sunday.  We have been back twice more, once on a Wednesday eve where they are supposed to close at 9:30.  We arrived at 8:20 and were informed at 8:50 it was last call.  We were hurried through our meal and left by 9:30......  We just returned last eve. which was Saturday eve., their hours state open til 10:00, Friday and Saturday so we decided to give it another try.  We arrived at 8:40........after waiting an extra 20 minutes for a wrong appetizer order, we were told at 9:10 that it was nearing last call.......we hadn't even ordered our first rolls yet.  The sushi chef was wrapping up items and cleaning........We asked if they were open til 10:00 as posted and showed their hours on website, reluctantly, they said they guessed so.......they don't know when they are \"supposed\" to close???????    We were hurried through another $80+ meal as they shut down sushi bar and cleaned around us, shut down perimeter lights and then paced back and forth in front of our booth.  As soon as we got up to leave, the music was shut off and more lights went off.  We left by 9:40.  I understand people want to go home, but shutting down 50 minutes, 30 minutes or 15 minutes prior to listed times while patrons are trying to enjoy a meal is rude.  I doubt they would appreciate it when they spend $80 + for a \"nice\" meal.  I'm sure they would expect the same good service when it's their money!  If you want to close at 9:00 or more like 8:00 for them, then post it and do so.  I thought restaurants are supposed to take patrons even if they come in minutes before listed/posted close and provide service........good service.....and be happy to do it, or go do something else.....  For people who eat a bit \"later,\" if you go, make sure you will be done with your dinner and walking out the door BEFORE 9:00, no matter the day!!!!!!  Their listed hours mean nothing!  3 strikes........."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in about 11 years (moved away).  Food was great, fresh fish, awesome quality.  Service was a little lacking, but still good stuff."}
{"text":"The food is really good, but the service is very slow. Our waitress was kind but struggled to check in with us."}
{"text":"Having eaten at many sushi restaurants around the valley, Sushi Ko is the best we've found.  Daisan, Raul, Fili and Hikuru are all very talented and friendly sushi chefs.  The fish is always fresh and there are many items that I have not seen offered elsewhere.  Sushi Ko also has many unique kitchen menu items.  My husband and I are very happy to have found Sushi Ko and will remain loyal customers for years to come!  Thank you Daisan!  We love you!"}
{"text":"Still the best and most authentic sushi restaurant in the Valley. Small, intimate, and authentic. Weekend  nights are busy, so call ahead of time!!!  Ask what's fresh and/or \"just in\".   Dai-san is a master."}
{"text":"So a client of mine picked this for dinner. I was shocked #1 that it was SUPER CASUAL (clients usually pick ultra high end spots for dinner when they know I'm paying...hehehe)!  #2 the sushi SUCKED.  I was really disappointed in the food.  Service was fine but it should be considering the food is sub-par and its a small mom & pop operation."}
{"text":"Finally! We found a real Japanese restaurant that serves something other than just sushi in the valley.  We were ecstatic to find that they had soba and udon dishes on the menu and it was quite good.  Also had the tempura and that was also quite good...not heavy and mushy like we've encountered at other places here.  Sushi was good ... not better or worse than other places.  One thing that was a little troublesome though, was that the restaurant was not crowded (maybe 4 other tables) and the sushi took an extremely long time to come out.  On top of that there were 2 sushi chefs working.  Lucky for them the food was good enough to make us forget the wait."}
{"text":"Been eating here for the past year and I have to say the sushi is AMAZING... the chefs are excellent.  Amazing hidden gem in Scottsdale, I eat here at least once a month!"}
{"text":"I agree with Elizabeth L. (see 11/27/2014) Sushi Ko used to be great...but everything from the service to the quality - especially the quality of carryout orders - has gone downhill.  I eat more carryout food here than dining in the restaurant since it is close to my office and convenient for lunch.    The carryout sushi and cooked foods seem fresh enough, but carryout salads and garnish are often long past fresh with black edges around shiso leaves or brown edges around wilted lettuce.  Throw it out if it is bad - don't sell it to your customers!  Nothing worse than getting back to work, opening that carryout box, and finding rotting shiso leaves under my fresh sushi or sashimi or having to throw out my lunch salad because of brown, wilted edges on the lettuce.    I hope this place gets their act together and returns to the consistantly high standards they were known for several years ago.  That said, I would still recommend Sushi Ko for good sushi in the Shea/94th Street area.  Any meal I have eaten in the restaurant has always been fresh and tasty; however, consistanly fresh garnish and salads in the carryout orders seem to be the problem."}
{"text":"This is our go to lunch spot when we want sushi. its next to work, the food is really good, the price is right and the people are super nice. its also hidden! so there is not a wait for lunch!  oh and their green tea is pretty dang good too!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I go here and sit at the sushi bar and plow through some giant clams, tako salads, saparo's and yellowtail.  My friend is an ex seafood exec and is pretty happy talking fish to the chefs and tasting what's new.  I go along for the ride.  I like the atmosphere and the service is always good and the sushi is decent with a good selection.  Then we head to Chompies next door for desert!"}
{"text":"Had sushi for lunch and it was excellent! I like the layout of the restaurant itself, its small, laid back and very cozy.  The waitress was super sweet, she was checking on us couple times during our lunch to make sure that everything was fine.  We had the sushi lunch special for $10.99 and came with cucumber salad and miso soup. (Wasn't crazy about the cucumber salad, but loved the miso soup).  There was generous amount of sushi, very fresh, excellent and the best in Scottsdale! I will definitely recommend this place to our friends and we will comeback very soon!  Thank you Sushi Ko,  ??????????? Arigat?gozaimashita"}
{"text":"Great first impression with the decor, although its tucked-away location made it sort of difficult to find. Not very busy and was seated right away. The service was very attentive and friendly, including the chefs, but when it came to the food it was only so-so. I've had many sushi rolls in my day and this wasn't ranked up there with some of the better ones I've tried."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here because we had to stop off at Home Depot. Started off with the Edamame; ordering for our main course, Sashimi and Tempura, Dragon roll and Tempura Roll. Had hot tea and my wife had Kirin light.  The server was polite and attentive.  The food was awesome. Sashimi was fresh, Tempura was cooked to perfection and sushi rolls were amazing.   Our only issue was when we got the bill, they had overcharged us. They had me down for two dinners. And when using my coupon from Restaurant.com, they automatically added the 18% gratuity. I caught it after they had charged my credit card, but they politely made everything right.  Love their food and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Steady fish, hit or miss. Traditional favorites, but where is the passion?  -- excellent maguro and tako # steady yellowtail (not fresh) and I ordered sashimi! # cold gyoza # ramen too salty, noodle too eggy, broth too dark  Methinks one might get better fish cuts with more regular patronage. Let's see."}
{"text":"This is a regular for our family. Not fancy, but good food. My husband always orders the Chirashi Sushi, and my daughters and I usually order off the sushi menu. My girls are not really into rolls, so we order Nigiri Sushi, and the happy hour is awesome! Service is so-so, lots of turnover in waitstaff, but we keep coming back for the great sushi."}
{"text":"There's nothing wrong with Sushi Ko. Unfortunately, when compared to the huge variety of Sushi places in the immediate area, there's nothing special about this place, either.   When a place has \"Sushi\" in its name, you'd expect the Sushi to be it's highlight, but Sushi Ko actually has bigger selection of cooked food that sticks out on its dinner menu. Very little on the Sushi menu looked like something I had to try, and even less looked unique. Also, if you are a Sushi novice, be prepared to ask the server a lot of questions, because there is very little explanation of what's in the rolls.   We had the Tuna Roll. Tasted like any other Sushi restaurant's.  The Jalapeno Roll. This was pretty good. Yellow Tale, Jalapeno, and some little green things on top. I was a little disappointed that something with Jalapeno in it didn't have more heat, but I would still recommend this roll.  Sea Bass. Served with mushrooms and a really good sauce. It was cooked perfectly.   Sushi Ko is an okay restaurant to check out. I'm glad I experimented and tried a new Sushi place, but I don't know if I'd go out of my to head back. If you do decide to go, it's also a little hard to find. Sushi Ko is tucked a way in a hidden corner of its shopper center. To find it, just look in between Chompie's and the massage parlor."}
{"text":"I was sampling at Helen and Jan's Sweet Republic when I asked Helen for recommendations on where to have a late lunch before I'd return to take a pint of ice cream home, and she directed me to Sushi Ko.  I arrived at SK at 4:30p only to be told that happy hour was from 5-6p, so I debated on heading over to Chompie's to try this Scottsdale location (I am always ready to eat sweet potato fries!) or wait for 5p to arrive.  Thank goodness Sprout's was just around the corner, and I could walk around and explore.  At 5p sharp, I returned to SK and headed straight to the sushi counter and took a seat- I like watching the chefs prepare the dishes.  As I was looking over the nigiri selections (50% off only applies to nigiri, 2 pcs. each), a server took my drink order.  I just wanted water, although I did contemplate on trying Kirin- a TALL bottle costs only $3!  This great value really didn't awe me since I'm not one to drink beers, but in the end I thought \"When in Rome...\"  (I only drank a quarter of the bottle, maybe less.)  I decided to try the   Salmon:  Always a solid choice.  I sometimes forget to ask if the salmon is wild or farmed.  I try to eat only wild, and I doubt that SK can offer wild salmon during HH.  At any rate,  these pieces tasted fresh and mild.  A contrast from the salty and fishy-tasting mackerel.  Mackerel:  I liked this at first, as it had a bolder flavor than the salmon, but by the second piece, the fishy taste combined with the saltiness overwhelmed my tastebuds, and subsequently, my duodenum.  (I'll spare you the visuals.)  Spicy scallops:  Ok, but I wouldn't order it again.  The scallops were sliced into smaller pieces, and I would have preferred them whole.  I've enjoyed them in a couple of places where the spicy kick was delivered to the receiver via a cream sauce- not authentic, perhaps, but that's how I prefer scallops.  (Speaking of awesome scallops, do check out Nouveau Bistro's!  I really have to go back there soon!!)  I did enjoy the crunchy seaweed wrapping the rice.       and Freshwater eel:  Hands-down, the best of the lot!  These were served very warm, with eel sauce drizzled on top.  (I swear, I do like sushi, which is traditionally served cold.)  I've never enjoyed eel before, for I either found its texture too rubbery in most places, or the accompanying sauce too sweet.  I savored these two pieces and fought the urge to order a second serving!  I will definitely be back for happy hour to try other selections, and more of the eel!  (There's also a sea eel version- opinions, anyone?)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The salad dressing is homemade and delish! You can take it home, just ask them for a bottle. Prices are great, service is friendly and absolutely the best sushi is Arizona."}
{"text":"A true hidden treasure, from the moment you walk in with the dim lighting, the laid back music, and rounded booth seats. The food is worth every penny, I had 1 crunchy sushi roll with eel sauce packed with sushi, 1 teriyaki steak which was moist, flavorful and presented very neatly and creatively with lots of color. The fried rice was amazing! This place is top notch and highly recommend"}
{"text":"Such a great sushi place! My favorite. My daughter wants to come here every time we get sushi and she knows her sushi very well. Very friendly staff and great environment. Very relaxing setting and quick service."}
{"text":"This little sushi restaurant is definitely a hidden gem. I wouldn't have found out about this place, if it weren't for my boyfriend and his friends. We especially love the waitresses there, who always make sure we have a great experience with them! Authentic Japanese food and quality sushi."}
{"text":"I am into sushi now and have been trying different places.  This place is in the same shopping center as Sprouts, tucked away in the corner near Chompie's.  I wish Sushi place would have more of a description of their sushi rolls, it would help those who do not know what is what.  I ordered take out and watched the sushi chefs make my sushi rolls with their bare hands no gloves.I was a bit upset when they said they used inexpensive farm raised salmon rather than the wild caught.  They will be having half price sushi starting next week for there new happy hour from 5-6:30pm.  I ordered the California roll (8 pieces), the Asparagus roll (8pieces) and the Veggie Roll (6 pieces) total with tax was $18.00 and this was for lunch.  They gave me lots of ginger which I love.  I love seaweed and notice they did have a seaweed soup which I might try next time when I go back for happy hour.  It is a very small place with a bar and a sushi bar and you can watch they make the rolls and such.  Good sushi, nice people, will be back."}
{"text":"Sushi Ko used to be great... But recently everything from service to quality had gone down hill.   They are seriously understaffed and the usual friendly waitress that has been there for so long doesn't seem to work there anymore.   Usually, I try to go for the lunch special combination (California roll, teriyaki Chicken, salad, rice, and miso soup) because it's a great deal and super delicious, however they changed their menu and don't have that option anymore. The staff is always very confused and lacks organization. On the upside, their salad dressing is still super delicious and the new spicy tuna bowl option has a lot of fish. I do feel that their chicken portion size has gone down and their miso soup is a lot more watery than it used to be.   All in all, I probably will be back for their house dressing and the nostalgia factor (used to go all the time in high school) but I know that I'll have to deal with less than stellar experience."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place. Even though it was not at all busy at lunchtime, no one approached our table for at least 15 minutes. The young man who seated us was standing around doing nothing for this whole time. After about 20 minutes, the same young man came to our table and took our drink order. We thought maybe he was just helping out the server since we couldn't figure out why he would just be standing there for so long and not even come over. This is, after all, a tiny restaurant with about 6 tables, so it was obvious to us how much he was not interested in taking care of the table. We  then sat around for another 20 minutes until we got any food. My kids' food came, and mine never showed up, which the server never even said anything about. When I called him over and asked him if mine was coming, we asked again what I ordered, and I watched him ring it up right in front of me. I asked him if he forgot to order it, and he denied that, but said they were \"looking for a quail's egg\" to put on top of it. My meal wasn't supposed to come with that. I asked for a few forks for the kids, and they never came, even while our server stood around again doing absolutely nothing. I had to go back to the sushi bar to track down forks, and that process was even difficult.   Really, we are not picky and all our server had to do was honestly just say he forgot. I was a server for many years, and a little honesty and a small apology for the terrible service would have made everything ok in my eyes. Instead, after we had all eaten, and were waiting for the check, he brought the edamame he also apparently forgot to order. By this time, the restaurant was dead. The bill was WAY too high for what we got ($100 for a pretty small amount of food). The quality of the food was ok, not great, or particularly fresh, but not terrible. It was definitely not worth the price, and it makes me cringe to think how much I spent on such an overall poor experience.  The service was TERRIBLE, and it would have been obvious to any other employee/owner of the restaurant who cared enough to notice what kind of service his/her customers were getting."}
{"text":"First I do not do reviews that much, because of may not be a good thing for a restaurant, but all I have to say is. This place is not a place for a good meal but a full meal. If you know what I meant!  If you want a quality fresh fish this is not the place, if you just want to be full and tell your friends that you are cultured enough to have some Japanese food then is ok to give a try.  \"If Rolls with Rice are your Ideal of sushi and sashimi  \" Over all not a place for a quality sashimi.   You do not get what you paid for. ( expensive but less than average)"}
{"text":"We've moved away from Scottsdale and miss our Sushi Ko.  The sushi is always delicious and well done.  Yes, the atmosphere is not your \"typical\" Scottsdale scene to be seen.  But for a young family, it works!  Kid friendly and Raul is the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality of fish and very little crowd. The place down the street is an old favorite but I'm going to come here more often. It was also more affordable."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here, the first time the food and service were outstanding! The pork fried rice and pork belly from the grill were superb! The sushi rolls we ordered were fresh and the quality was superb!"}
{"text":"The default 3-star review is described by Yelp as \"A-OK.\" And that is exactly what this place is: an A-OK place to grab sushi for lunch on a weekday.  We mostly ordered the nigiri lunch combos. Because you know, real sushi eaters don't go for rolls, at least that's what I'm told by my nigiri-eating friends. It was okay. The tuna was definitely the best morsel on the plate and no one liked the salmon. We ate it of course, but no one really went nuts for it.  Distinguishing factor: quick service+price+convenience combo"}
{"text":"Sushi Ko is my other favorite neighborhood sushi spot. The happy hour from 5-6pm on Sun-Thurs is the best deal in town. I usually stuff my face with 1/2 priced unagi, ama ebi, escolar and spicy scallop nigiri.   Service is pretty good and there are usually seats up at the bar when I'm pressed for time. I'm hoping to try their shabu shabu one day."}
{"text":"It was really empty the night I went in for dinner.   Just wasn't really impressed with anything. Had a Chirashi sushi and just didn't really show any real visual appeal to it. Main complaint is the rice was not evenly seasoned with vinegar. Had some really bland sections then a burst of vinegar every other bite. Disappointing for a sushi restaurant.   Wait I did think the tempura shrimp in one of the rolls I ordered was pretty well done fresh out of the fryer and really crisp. I got a salmon salad for free which was nice too.  I did have a yelp deal for $20 for $10 but probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent everything! This is the 20th, minimum, time we've been here and you just have to know what to order.  First off, the fish is fresh, so any sushi good to go. One of our favorite, Salmon Nagiri with thin sliced lemon, ponzu sauce and scallions. Next, a favorite our Phamily introduced is to, Hot Pot! Thinly sliced steak, tons of veggies and noddles! Yum! Plus you can spice it up with all kinds of sauces. Lastly, and my personal favorite, chicken fried rice! Delish! Can't wait to take some home with me! Great service, always, why try places you scratch your head at and say why doshite?!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi lover and am always in search of a good Japanese restaurant no matter where I travel to. I've actually eaten Japanese food in Japan so I know a little about authentic Japanese food :) Anyway, I took my family to this restaurant after hearing rave reviews from friends. Sad to say that I was sorely disappointed and a bit confused about all the great reviews. The ambiance is nice enough but our server didn't seem like she knew what she was doing. The food was so-so...nothing memorable. I can honestly say that I've actually had better Japanese food at the Kabuki restaurant in Tempe or any of the RA Sushi joints around town."}
{"text":"Love this little hole a wall sushi restaurant. We are always welcomed with a great hello. The fish is fresh n yummy. And the ambiance is a low-key vibe. Prices are right too."}
{"text":"Great little sushi/restaurant in Scottsdale. Our Sushi was great, along with the appetizers we ordered. Our server was very nice. And the ambiance of the restaurant was well done. A little hard to find because it is tucked away in the shopping center. FYI they do close at 2pm and reopen at 5pm for Dinner."}
{"text":"I came to Sushi Ko using a Groupon with one of my buddies.  My buddy has been to Sushi Ko several times with his father growing up, so I was eager to try it out.  Sushi Ko has the feel of an authentic hole in the wall sushi restaurant.  I haven't found a non-commercial sushi joint in AZ yet.  I was quite surprised because Sushi Ko is in mid/North Scottsdale territory.  We ordered mostly sashimis and non-cooked rolls.  The fish tasted relatively crisp and fresh (considering there is no ocean in AZ).  Overall, I would definitely recommend Sushi Ko to authentic sushi fanatics."}
{"text":"I came here with a company of a dozen for a belated birthday dinner.  The highlight of our feast was the Shabu Shabu.  Service - 2: The communication was unclear which caused some confusion and a rough start to our dining experience.  It was one of those trying to be helpful but not really because the answer led to more confusion.  A better explanation of the Shabu Shabu arrangement would have resulted in a more positive experience.   Food - 3: The spicy poki was a tad bit salty and not as fresh tasting as I imagined.  Sushi was just OK, nothing to rave about.  The raw meat for our Shabu Shabu was finely sliced, but was dry on the serving plate.  Plus, there was not much of it either.  Supposedly, their serving size is for 2 people.  The soup itself had light flavoring.  PLENTY of veggies and non-meat though!  Price - 2: For a Shabu Shabu of this quality and quantity, not worth it.  If all I had was that, I would still be hungry.  Ambiance - 2: Very low key, nothing flashy humble little place.  I remembered only 5 booths, 2 or 3 tables.  Sushi bar had like 5 chairs? Tiny place as you can tell. :)  Location - 2: Its kind of hard to find due to the way the the shopping complex is.  Not very noticeable from the parking lot.  You need to drive by or walk inside the shopping area to find it.  The positives were refilling drinks and replenishing the soup stock for the Shabu Shabu.  A complimentary dessert was brought out towards the end for the guest of honor.  Price and Service were the main factors that made this a 2-star experience."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a corridor next to Chompies, Sushi Ko is a solid Asian restaurant.  They are small, and their menu more extensive than you would think for a small place, but every time has been a pleasure.  I haven't been during busy hours, so I cannot comment on long waits, as I have had none.  They do close a bit early for an establishment that I would think would be open later given the crowd they would attract.  Everyone has always been friendly though, and the food delicious."}
