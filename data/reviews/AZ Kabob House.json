{"text":"The food is great, the place is convenient and clean, and the service is friendly. We love coming here for a quick casual dinner. I recommend the chicken."}
{"text":"Excellent kabobs.  Highly recommend. Try chicken or lamb kabobs. Best falafels in the area--moist, tender, and well-seasoned.  A favorite. Have eaten at kabob restaurants around the world and AZ Kabob is among the best."}
{"text":"Walked in yesterday not expecting too much and was absolutely delighted! I decided on a simple Greek salad and added the chicken kabob and it was superb.
I love Mediterranean food and this place has ample selection. My wife got the sampler -- The falafel was excellent. They make everything to order fresh. She has severe allergies and \"K\" (our host) was patient and helpful. I love that they do not use soybean oil at all. Their entrees looked delish from the other tables... we will definitely be back. Thank you for such a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"My husband & I just treated ourselves to AZ Kabob after a long day at work. We decided we weren't hungry enough for any entree, and went with some sandwiches. My husband ordered the Beef Shawrma and I grabbed the beef kabob sandwich.

Each sandwich was served with a small side salad, a yogurt sauce, and a salad dressing. The yogurt sauce almost tzatziki like, but not. It was still good. 

The beef on each was cooked perfectly and thoroughly. Flavoring was wonderful, yet not over powering. The sauce was the perfect compliment to each of the sandwiches (we decided to split the sandwiches in half).

My husband enjoyed the salad dressing sauce, while I decide to stick with the yogurt sauce for the salad. It was fresh & crisp.

Finally, we splurged ourselves for some dessert. The saffron ice cream had a shockingly pleasant taste. Something that catches the palette off guard. Almost a mixture between something cleansing and refreshing, yet flowery. I don't know how else to explain it, other than GO TRY IT.

We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I get the greek salad with chicken kabob every time i come in and it never fails. One of my favorite meals. The meat is always tender and delicious and the greek salad is perfect with it. The beef soltani is another favorite with saffron rice. It's all so flavorful and amazing. I love coming here"}
{"text":"Ate here on a whim before a movie (had a chicken gyro) - was blown away by the chicken (moist, cooked perfectly) and tzatziki - was also surprised how much I liked the pickle on the gyro.

Anyway, ended up hiring them to cater a 20 person party we were having a few weeks later, cost per-person was *very* reasonable and working with them to more or less order their entire menu was a breeze... along the lines of \"I want A, B, C, D... you know what, I just want a sampling of everything.\" -- they figured out amounts.

I was VERY skeptical that they would be able to make that volume of food and still have it taste as good as it did for the two of us... what a fantastic surprise when I was wrong.

The owner delivered 2 mobile warmers full of trays of food an hour before the party and for no extra charge let me keep the warmers because it would \"make the food taste much better if you aren't going to eat for a while\" (I dropped them off the next morning).

We had at least 6 people come up to us and comment how amazing the food way - we saw many guests go back for 2nds and some even go back for 3rds.

All of the meat was spot on; chicken was moist and tasteful, the filet was tender and truly filet - not some lower quality meat with a lot of connective tissue in it - it was honest to god, tender filet meat (I've cooked enough steak in my life to watch for these kinds of things).

The kebabs were juicy and bursting with flavor and the salmon kebabs ended up being one of the party favorites - they are spiced and booked perfectly, the salmon almost flakes apart if you push on it a little bit.

The tzatziki was the star of the show - fantastic taste. Rice was spot on as well (not soggy, not under cooked... just perfect amount of chew).

The baklava was fine, but I'm biased... I make the world's best baklava (hint: it requires enough butter to kill a small family) but given how biased I am, I thought it was good enough to order a tray from them and not make it myself so that counts for something.

Besides eating here again, we fully expect to use them again to cater other events in the future. You guys knocked it out of the park, thank you!"}
{"text":"My very picky Midwestern husband and three children enjoyed AZ Kabobs very much. We all split the family platter and appetizer sampler. Each plate was licked clean. We did substitute the gyro meat for the lamb. My one-year-old ate his weight in falafel. We will be going back soon - maybe tomorrow! Look for the Groupon too!"}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. 
Tried the chicken shawarma entree, it comes with basamati rice,tzatiki sauce,pita bread and butter.
Only problem is with the quantity. You get very less for the price you pay."}
{"text":"Loved the very modern nd chic ambience. Very friendly host, who helped me pick a vegetarian dish. It was pomogranate and walnut based stew wth rice and falafel. The stew was toooo tangy for my pallete but very nice falafel and fresh pita bread and hummus. Will go again and try smthng spicy"}
{"text":"Awesome trendy clean and above all friendly caring owners that are behind the counter cooking fresh food. I've been at least a dozen times and I've never been disappointed. Chicken salad tziki sauce...all to die for. My fav go to place. I even have my BFF driving all the way from PV to eat there. She's addicted also. Love it!!  Lori"}
{"text":"We love AZ kabob house. Food is amazing, nothing on the menu we haven't loved!  The beautiful decor is not something you would expect from a \"fast food\" restaurant. Service is super friendly and place is always clean."}
{"text":"Had the Greek salad with chicken kabob.  Super healthy, delicious seasoning on the chicken.  A tad pricey but not out of the ordinary for North Scottsdale.  Big portions.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We went here first thanks to Groupon. The grilled salmon kabob was perfection. It came a a pita, salad and rice. They were sold out of gyro meat that day; it was barely even dinner time. The ground beef gyro was a good stand in. We went back again because of how enjoyable the grilled salmon kabob was. This time, I was served a quarter of a pita and the gyro sandwich came with the most pitiful serving of a few fries. I'm aware of appropriate portion sizes for a meal, but when I go to a restaurant, I am expecting beyond that. Great first experience, really disappointed the second time around."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great quality, nice ambience, sweet employees who go up and beyond to make your experience pleasant. I will totally order from them for my next party!!!! Local Gem finally in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Not only do they have outstanding customer service, but their food is delicious. My wife is pregnant and was craving Persian food. We got to the restaurant 10 min past closing. Their kitchen was basically closed, but they opened it back up and my wife ordered her favorite dish and doogh drink. It made her night. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience. Picked up chicken and steak kabobs for a dinner party and it was amazing. Everyone loved the flavor and tenderness of the meats. It came with delicious saffron rice that was plentiful. Highly recommend this little hidden treasure. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and had the pomegranate sauce and walnuts chicken stew. It was good. I also liked the restaurant's soothing garden ambience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was excellent. The eating area is very clean and there are a few tables outside if you wish."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and very tasty.  There is a wide range of choices and substitutions weren't an issue.   The restaurant is nicely decorated.  We spent 2 hours eating and chatting with friends and had a good time.  The prices are reasonable, and the staff were very polite."}
{"text":"I have been to Persian restaurants all over the world and they have the best salad Shirazi of anywhere! Truly authentic. Their barg was also great!  A real find!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem and simply the best Persian food in Arizona.  I have been to AZ kabob 4 times and every time, I was amazed by the great taste of their food and the quality of their service. The food, environment, and staff are simply amazing. I have tried the Soltani - Koobideh- Jojeh kabob meals and I can say this is exactly how kabob tastes in Iran. I usually don't write reviews for restaurants but after being to AZ kabob I had to let others know how amazing this place is with very reasonable price and generous portions of their menu. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking to experience the true taste of Persian food. I will definitely be going back to AZ kabob many more times."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to try this place and boy do I regret it. Bad service and the food was not good at all. The food was burnt and they provided horrible service. I will never go back here again"}
{"text":"Really nice staff. Unfortunately the food wasn't that great. The hummus was very bland and kind of tasted like it was store bought. The chicken kabob also lacked some flavor. My boyfriend had the gyro and the lamb was sooooo dry and over-cooked with lots of crunch. Overpriced (I guess because of location). Won't be back, sorry :("}
{"text":"Great food from my hometown if this is your first time trying Persian food you should definitely come here the food is the best and cozy atmosphere and the staff is very very friendly and great proportions toooo"}
{"text":"I decided to try this spot and became a fan.  The food is excellent.  The Chicken Shwarma, out of this world good, but the other items are great too.   My only complaint is that the Hummus appetizer should come with more than 1 pita.  Need it to scoop up all that good Hummus!  

Great place, I keep going back.  If the Groupon is still available, snag it, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Gyro Wrap was fabulous and the atmosphere was great. Loved it. I didn't meet the review space requirement so excuse the random letters.. ShanakanababbananababsvbaNnbavavhanavsbznsjshbabanansnznbzbzbzvzbznNzbvzvsvzvVzbzbbzbzbbzbzbzbzbzbbznzn"}
{"text":"This is the best Chicken Shawarma I've ever had. This place makes good food. The environment is clean and nice. Small but great food and service. I am a repeat customer and it's consistently great."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here after finding the Tea Light Café closed.  My husband had koobideh platter which came with either Persian rice or half rice, half salad.  I had a greek salad and we shared a hummus and pita appetizer.  Everything was delicious and the koobideh was one of the best we've ever had.  Generous portions and reasonable prices.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Its quite opposite to my residence, I tried chicken kabob for 3-4 times, amazing food. They serve you the best quality and pretty great ambiance."}
{"text":"The food is really amazing.  We had the roasted eggplant and it was the best I have ever eaten.  We loved the chicken, the salad, the bread, the baklava- can't say anything negative AT ALL.  
After a movie at Harkins, just walk around the corner.  You won't be disappointed. It is incredible!!"}
{"text":"Appetizer platter keeps me coming back.  Best Greek food around."}
{"text":"We stopped for quick bite, something different. Young lady behind the counter greeted us, very pleasant. The place is nice and very clean. I ordered the Chicken Kabob and my husband order the lamb, food came out with salad and white rice. it was hot and delicious.  It was the right amount of portions for the money. We decided to visit them one more time before leaving to go home to NY."}
{"text":"For my job I travel all over country and usually want to try different food. Although this was not my first time having Persian food but I have to tell you that it was one of the best Persian foods I have had and I recommend AZ Kabob to everyone."}
{"text":"We stopped in while driving around thanks to the Yelp reviews. We had a nice lunch here.

Overall, the food was good and we enjoyed the lamb kabobs and some different appetizers. Quick service and excellent food quality."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! The gyro was delicious and we love the vegetarian options for all of the vegetarians in our family as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place.  Food is delicious and large portions.  Very fresh and not expensive.  Friendly staff and beautiful & clean inside."}
{"text":"Fantastic tasty food. Love the baklava and their saffron ice cream is so good! Staff were very cordial and helpful."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner and had the lamb kabobs.
Nice plate of food that included the lamb, rice and salad for $13. A bit pricey, but the food and service was good. This was an order at the counter and then sit type place. 
I thought the lamb was good and the salad with their dressing very good."}
{"text":"The food is great here and it's right across the street from my office. I always get the lamb but my friends have said that the filet is great too! The ingredients are fresh and my meat is grilled to perfection every time."}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem of a place. Nothing was subpar, everything was delicious. Service was fantastic, genuine and steady. Food came fast. Grilled vegetables, schwarma, kabobs, humus, and salad were all amazing. 

Great atmosphere, kid friendly. Quiet, calm. Very clean and fresh food. Very clean and honest. True to the ingredients."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Located near theatre so you can eat before or after. We had the grilled chicken kabob with rice and the gyro plate with a hummus appetizer.  Food was good and priced well."}
{"text":"Really good!!! My order was the gyro entree with salad and rice. Great value, I can't wait to try other items."}
{"text":"Being Iranian and coming from Los Angeles, I know something about Persian foods. Last night I tried the combination kebab and it was excellent. 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place truly deserves five stars.  It is small super clean and modern café that serves middle eastern kebabs and such.  The people there are nice and friendly.

So happy to say that the food was amazing.  The chicken kebab was perfectly cooked and flavored totally yummy!  The lamb kebab was very good as well!  The plates can be served with all rice or all salad or half of each.  The bread that's served with the dishes was also fresh soft and so good!!

There is a self-serve drink fountain.

I really can't wait to go back thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and I order their gyro wrap. The gyro was tasty and had lots of meat and came with a small salad. Friend had the steak kabob which came with rice and a little salad. He inhaled his meal so I know he thoroughly enjoyed it. I will be going back again."}
{"text":"AZKH is a super trendy Persian restaurant! Food is good and people are friendly.

We got the chicken soultani plate and the chicken wrap. Both were excellent in quality and perfect in quantity. For dessert, we got the saffron ice cream sandwich. Surprisingly, the ice cream's taste consist more of rose water than saffron. It was still delicious though.

Very good, highly recommended."}
{"text":"I came for the first time last week. I had the chicken shawarma and it hit the spot. The rice was good and the chicken was very flavorful which I appreciate."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. There was a laidback and yet refined ambience to the restaurant. You walk in, place your order at the back counter, then they bring your food. The portion sizes were great for what you pay, like my gyro platter had an even amount of meat to salad to rice. I think I heard that you could get double rice or double salad too. I wasn't told that, but I think I heard it said to the customer behind me. We would definitely come back and recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We stumbled in here  on a whim and have been back several times since. I am a vegetarian and there are plenty of options for me. Every dish we have ordered has been delicious! Brought my mom here two weeks ago and she wanted to go back again this week. The baba ganoush tastes homemade & is my absolute favorite!! In fact, my fiancé normally dislikes baba ganoush but can't help but keep digging into this one, he loves it.To top it all off the service is wonderful. The staff is extremely friendly and have no problem explaining certain dishes to you. We are huge fans and will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. The location is very convenient. People are so friendly. Prices are reasonable. Please give it a try and enjoy some Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"The food is excellent at a very affordable price.  The decor is modern with a hint of \"old world\" to it.  A cute place inside!  The chicken shwarma wrap is fab!"}
{"text":"So-so quality, diminutive soul-less portions and VERY overpriced. Haji Baba and the Flaming Kabob in Tempe both put this \"trendy\" Snotsdale poseur place to shame. (What's so \"trendy\" about a place where you get your own plastic utensils, anyway?!). The atmosphere is more like a Baskin Robbins than anything MIddle Eastern! Functionally, these guys are more Scottish than Middle Eastern!"}
{"text":"Not horribly impressed with this place.  The filet kabob was pretty good but the chicken was a little dry and could use more flavor.
The cucumber refresher was just a disappointment......so much sugary syrup and shredded cucumber."}
{"text":"Hello Followers:  Today I am writing about AZ Kabob House.  We have been to this restaurant twice, so my review summarizes both visits.  This is a small restaurant located in a strip mall, so don't look for it from the street or you will drive by.  Staff are friendly and are willing to answer questions you have.  But, be specific in your questions or you will receive a \"general\" answer.

First, this is not a sit down and be served restaurant.  This is a walk in, order at the counter, and your food it brought to you type of restaurant.  Which is fine - - - but if you are bringing a date it may not be what you expect.

Regarding the food:  We have ordered several dishes here.  Our favorite is the boneless chicken breast kabob.  

The chicken breast kabob ($10):  Both times the chicken came out very tender and not overcooked.  We usually order 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad.  The salad is a perfect compliment to the chicken spices.  The portion served is perfect for one hungry adult, or for an adult with a medium appetite and one child.  Since the dishes are made to order the \"hot\" things are served hot and items which should be \"cold\" such as the salad are cold - - but, they are all served on the same plate together.  This dish is served with a grilled tomato which was a nice touch.  I give the chicken dish a four-star stand alone rating.

The grilled salmon ($15):  The salmon had a nice flavor to it (not strong) and was not overcooked.  I ordered it well done and it came out well done, seared nicely from the grill and spices, but not overcooked.  Again, we ordered 1/2 rice and 1/2 salad on the side.  This dish was NOT served with a grilled tomato and we missed that!  In fairness to the restaurant, the menu did not say it was served with a grilled tomato, but we did not notice that until we were served.  I don't understand why it would not be.  It is served the same way as the chicken breast kabob and it is the only Fish Entree on the menu.  Because of this, I would give the salmon dish a three-star rating stand alone because it is not consistently served as the other kabob dishes are.
To order the salmon and pay $5.00 more than the chicken entree, the chicken is a better deal.

Note:  For those of you who only eat wild-caught salmon as opposed to farm-raised salmon, you would have to ask about the salmon before ordering. 

The pita bread served with your meal is nothing special.  Plain, nondescript.  it would have been wonderful with melted butter brushed on it and grilled.  Now, served like this - - - that would create a tasty platter!     

The Fesenjon:  is a stew made with ground walnuts with pomegranate sauce served with chicken or small meat balls.  We ordered it with the chicken, although, we could not find the chicken in the dish!  It was barely there or they forgot to add it to the dish is what I think happened here.  Unfortunately, we got this as a take out so we did not realize it was missing until the next day and we lived too far away to drive back.  
Issues:  The sauce was very, very sweet, thick and gritty.  I understand the pomegranates make the sauce sweet but this was so sweet it could have passed for a dessert.  There were not the correct mix of spices incorporated into the dish to offset the walnuts and the pomegranates.  Therefore, I would only give this dish by itself a two-star rating.     

There are what they call \"freshly made\" desserts at the check out counter.  But, I wonder if they really make a fresh pan of baklava every day??  I am Greek and know the work that goes into an authentic baklava.  

The movie theater is in the same complex, so if you want a casual afternoon or evening to see a movie, then grab a bite to eat here would make for a nice set of events to enjoy."}
{"text":"What a great find. My husband and I have been here several times and think the food is better each time we come. The roasted eggplant appetizer is devine.
We keep ordering the same entree of Chicken Soltani because we enjoy it so much. The chicken and beef is extremely tender. None of the food is overly salty.
It's a family owned business and they are all very pleasant. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem in North Scottsdale. Chicken soltani is amazing and the service was friendly and quick. I definitely will be stopping by again soon."}
{"text":"Well traveled girl... best chicken swarm sandwich I have ever had. The kind of thing you crave every week (and now i do). Great service, very clean. If there was a complaint to be had is the napkins are awful ... literally fall right apart and I feel like they should have some fancy drinks/teas to go with menu but really great place"}
{"text":"It was really good. The servings are huge that I could have eaten half and saved the rest for dinner. I had the chicken kebabs plate. Chicken was very tender. Rice was delicious."}
{"text":"I give this place a three. The food is mediocre for the price you pay which is why I knocked off a star. They give the prices of just ONE skewer of food on the menu. And they charge you 5 bucks for an additional skewer... Most standard places have two skewers in their order. Not impressed. For the price of this food, I'd rather go to Persian Room and get better quality for a deserving price. I was also charged a for an extra tomato....they only give you half of one to begin with... Makes no sense. Bread is cold when you get it. Salad is okay. Nothing special. Dressing for it isn't the best. If you have the options for rice substation I would go with that. The rice wasn't too warm either when I got my food. I would only come here again if I was in need of semi-decent Iranian food on the go. The staff is nice though, which is why I give this place a three."}
{"text":"Beautiful family owned restaurant. You will get the full Persian experience  at AZ Kabob House. AUTHENTIC food, modern but most importantly clean environment. Ask them about their wall art. The staff is always so happy to talk and converse. Get the full Mediterranean experience at AZ Kabob."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, friendly local restaurant  atmosphere.   Right around the corner from the Harkins 101 movie theater.   The salmon kabob was outrageous."}
{"text":"Great food, lovely service. The restaurant is very clean. The portions are generous and the atmosphere affords you the opportunity to have a great chat with friends. Parking is also supper easy."}
{"text":"This place is great. Fresh. Flavorful. Great service. Not the cheapest lunch but worth every penny. I have had the lamb kabobs and the chicken & beef soltani. Excellent choices. 

Sandwiches and wraps as well plus catering. Would be great for a catered lunch for the businesses in the area."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the finest Persian restaurants in the valley. Nothing fancy and located in a shopping center, this place serves the best Koobideh I have had since visiting Tehran in the late 70s. Flavorful, moist and tender with plenty of long grain saffron rice. It comes with all the right garnishes of roasted tomato and raw onion. The only thing missing is the raw egg yolk for the rice - but that is almost impossible to get a restaurant to serve these days. Also their hummus is also one of the best I have had - very, very creamy and delicious. AZ Kabob House is worth the visit - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Used a Groupon. Chicken Kabob  and Falafel appetizer were delicious.  The sliced pickle and spicy yellow pepper were out of place on the falafel app. Would have preferred Cucumber and fresh tomatoes. Overall, loved the decor, service and food.  Baklava was delicious.  Would love it freshly made day of.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Solid meals for 3 chefs today. Came in wearing chef whites and the staff freaked out, sorry about that we need some nourishment during the American Culinary Foundation meeting down the road. Awesome chicken kabobs and kabob koobideh and light fluffy falafel."}
{"text":"Another excellent find on yelp. The food is delicious the staff is friendly. Excellent place to eat. Here on vacation but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is more of a 4 1/2 than a 4.  Straight up delicious.  Its a small hidden gem that really deserves as much business as possible to keep it here... please!  I got the chicken shawarma entree which came with rice and a small Greek salad on the side as well as the hummus appetizer.  The hummus was fantastic albeit could use some more pita to scoop the deliciousness up with.  The star of the show however was the entree of course.  Rarely would I ever mention rice as something to applaud but the rice was super soft, delicate and delicious.  The shawarma was delectable.  I had it for leftovers and quite frankly already miss it.  Marinated in a magical concoction of ...whatever it is... its great.  Already recommended to others and will 100% be returning."}
{"text":"After living back east and having many choices of authentic Kabob houses, it's nice to find one in the Scottsdale area. The food is fresh, meat is tender. The atmosphere is nice, and staff are friendly. Prices are reasonable. 
I will definitely recommend this kabob house to my friends!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch. All of our food was very tasty. Only issue was not knowing exactly what was included in each dish, I.e. We ordered gyro platter thinking it would be a classic gyro and side, but was a salad with gyro meat. All was super tasty! We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"So delicious! The facility is clean and stylish but simple. The food was fresh! Staff is friendly and helpful with ordering. I am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place...  the food is fantastic, and the people that own and run it are wonderful.  If you haven't been here before, you need to che k it out!"}
{"text":"This place was a treasure in a corner. I had the beef entree from the recommendation of Arman. I got half rice and half salad and there was plenty of food and came with a half of a pita. I would definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Good Persian food with reasonable price. Quick service angst friendly crew. Food is tasty.  Portions are good."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here... Great 'hole in the wall' that turned out to be much nicer than expected.  Very nice decor, friendly staff, quick service & great food.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We have been looking for an authentic Greek restaurant that could become our takeout choice. The gyros was tender and tasty and the side salad was fresh and plenty for lunch."}
{"text":"First time to this place. I came based on Yelp reviews! I loved my gyro plate. Very flavorful and a generous portion. I requested the half salad, half rice side. I personally did not care for the rice..I would rather have a double Greek salad for my side. The dressing is unbelievable. Overall, all of the food is so fresh. 
We got a hummus app. The pita is so fresh. My only complaint would be the hummus. It thought it lacked flavor. I would not get it again. 
Great job with the atmosphere and customer service!"}
{"text":"They literally have the best kabob koobide in town. Fantastic service! I will be a regular customer from now on."}
{"text":"Conveniently close to the movie theater and other stores, Very nice place and clean, Very Friendly helpful staff. Food Is AWESOME, Great prices, Family friendly. We are looking forward to eating there again. Love from Mary & Carl."}
{"text":"Really good food and its a lot for the price. I had the chicken kabob with half salad and half rice. Great seasoning on everything 
I also had hummus which was very delish and the pita bread was soft really good 
Will be coming back"}
{"text":"First time here and I loved it!! It is so good. The place looks creative and modern inside- love it! And most importantly their food is awesome! You must try before you judge. In addition, the service was excellent. Highly recommended and I will be back personally!"}
{"text":"First time here and the food was really good although a bit on the pricey side if you compare to other restaurants in the same category.  That being said, I got the Persian Salad with Chicken and that was $11, it was a bowl of chopped cucumber, onion, mint, like a Persian salsa, the chicken was from the kabob and it was well seasoned and moist."}
{"text":"Lamb kebab was delicious! The rice was decent, but could have used a little more seasoning or something. The \"salad\" is basically cut up lettuce. Chicken schwarma was meh. Good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. People are humble and fantastic and food is always delivered to you in a restaurant like way even though it's considered fast food. Thank you so much for your hard work and dedication to authentic Persian food."}
{"text":"Food was good, customer service was ok. Nothing spectacular here, we are used to the Persian Room but figured we would try something else for a change. We probably won't be back unless we happen to be in the area for something else."}
{"text":"Great casual place. Great outdoor dining. Healthy options. Great service. Great food. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is one of the better persian restaurants around the Phoenix valley.  Loved their baba ganoush.  The rice was well done and the chicken schwarma was good, a bit spicier than I'm used to/ prefer and the pieces of meat were small but they do give you a healthy amount.  We left happy and full."}
{"text":"Awesome place.. Had a boneless chicken and shawarma wrap with my wife and kid. We love both the items and place is also clean, good and quick service."}
{"text":"I have had a lot of Middle Eastern food and this place is one of the best. Excellent, fresh, flavorful food. Very nice, comfortable ambiance. Independent business, run by the owner. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great customer service on phone orders. The food was just like described by other Yelp members.  
The chicken kabobs were juicy and tasty. I had them substitute the rice for more salad and they had no issues making changes.  

Such a great little place, I would def come here again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lamb kabob plate.  Everything was delicious.  The lamb was tender and flavorful.  The rice was good. The salad was also fresh and crisp. The young man who helped was welcoming, friendly and helpful. 
I cant wait to go back to try other things on their large menu."}
{"text":"This is my third visit and I must say that the food is always fresh and delicious and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I love the chicken kabob, where the meat is always tender and juicy. The basmati rice is plentiful and aromatic.  I ordered a new dish (for me) to go, it was supposed to be eggplant and peas.  When I got home and dished it out, there were peas and pieces of lamb in a thick, mild tasting sauce.  I'm guessing it was not what I ordered, but it didn't matter, it was tasty.  I will order the eggplant next time.  

As for my other two visits, I dined at the restaurant.  Service was quick and the salad that came with the platter was fresh and crisp. And their gyros with tzaziki sauce is excellent and makes for an inexpensive and delicious lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Best Kobob/Persian/Mediterranean food in town! We have been here over 10 times and we are never let down! Chicken Shawarma Entree is our favorite! We tried other places in town and the whole time I was eating their gross food I was wishing we would have drove to AZ Kabob! Amazing customer service, family owned, clean & crisp! The food is always quality and they have an A rating! You will love the food you get for the price too. You can tell they care about their business."}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of the double ground beef kobideh, it is so delicious. Kasra, the young cashier, was amazing as always. I Highly recommend this Persian restaurant."}
{"text":"Good price good food
For those who Wana try new food, try Dizi
It is traditional persian food only found there"}
{"text":"Truly a fantastic dining experience! A genuine fusion between the newly popular genre of \"fast casual\" and \"fine dining\". Generous portions, quality food, and impressive ambiance without compromising your wallet. I have yet to find a restaurant in the Phoenix Metro area that ticks all the boxes a restaurant should (good portions, quality food, service, ambiance) while being extremely affordable the way AZ Kabob House does. I love all the entrees, and make sure to save room for dessert, as both the baklava and saffron ice cream are to die for!"}
{"text":"Great food, had the soltani and meat was really tender and delicious. Well seasoned, amazing rice and good tzatziki. Easy to park and good service."}
{"text":"What a treasure in the middle of shopping center in Phoenix . This place was recommended to us by a friend and we were not disappointed.
The service was fast and the food was not only great but very reasonable. We had the chicken and beef kabab and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great new place for before or after a movie. Loved the chicken kabobs and the falafel."}
{"text":"For such an unassuming little place they serve up some of the best Mediterranean food in the valley. I trusted the other Yelpers and the waiter in choosing the salmon kabob. So dang good! The rice was perfect (looked like it was going to be dry, but was great even w/out the pad of butter provided), the flat bread was hot, soft but chewy (i.e.perfect), the Tzatziki dip was cool and refreshing, and the grilled tomato was delish. Hubby had the Gyro Platter and loved it too. Entrees were so big we both had leftovers which were tasty the next day. We also ordered a Greek Salad and just like everything else it was huge, extremely fresh with just the right herbs and spices. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best in the business when it comes to this type of cuisine. Anything off the menu is a blessing to eat"}
{"text":"As an Iranian new to the Scottsdale area, AZ Kabob was a delightful treat and made me feel at home. I typically order a beef koobideh at Persian restaurants and theirs was great! 

In addition, the staff is very friendly and the place is maintained very well. I will certainly come back soon."}
{"text":"Great spot! Great flavors, great setting, great takeout! We needed a spot like this up here!!! We haven't had a bad thing here! Persian salad is awesome! Shawarma's are fantastic!! Satisfy your craving!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly service and great value. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love coming here.  Always, clean, friendly and very tasty food.  I typically get the greek salad w/ gyro meat and enjoy every bit of it!
The prices are decent too!"}
{"text":"Fresh delicious Persian food, excellent service, fast and friendly, I ordered beef filler Kabab and it was delicious highly recommend this place, I will be back"}
{"text":"We were in the mood to try something different and we thought we'd stop in this tiny little restaurant. Wasn't expecting much but we were WOWED at the food. Almost as good as the Persian room for much less money. We will return. The chicken and the barberry Rice was excellent for fast food restaurant. 
When you check-in you also get a dollar off on your first meal. Don't miss out on this gem for lunch.

Best saffron ice in the World. A must have for any food connoisseur.  Home made ice cream."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to AZ Kabob house in a while - and my lunch buddy was in the mood for gyros.

AZ Kabob house is our current favorite gyros and etc. place in north Phoenix.

I got the gyro wrap - very good.  Gyro meat was not dry - tzaziki sauce was spot on - plenty of lettuce, tomato, and pickle slices instead of cucumber (different, but I have to pick the cucumber out - makes me burp - so I kind of liked this idea!).  Came with a small side salad.

My friend ordered the chicken kabob - just looking at it, I could see it was cooked perfectly - I could see that it was juicy (confirmed by asking, though, just to be safe ;-)).

Everybody working there was friendly - big smiles.  Really not sure why we hadn't been in a while (a little outside our normal lunch radius, I guess).

If you've got a hankering for middle eastern food, give AZ Kabob House a try - you'll be happy - and if you order a piece of baklava, you'll be ecstatic!"}
{"text":"First thought walking in was I'll be coming back here just based off the clean and modern atmosphere, everything looks prestige. Service was also just as impressive. I was craving some fesenjuan and to my surprise it was on the menu. Pricing is also very reasonable and Fresh Baklava to boot."}
{"text":"Awesome food. My wife and I just stumbled in before a movie and were surprised at the quality of the food and service."}
{"text":"For a small family joint they sure are attentive with their service and add to that the fact that their food is outstanding ! A must visit. We were a table of 5 and while the take out crowd just kept coming , our food was served promptly and was delicious"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after driving by several times and was looking for something different - so glad we did. On our second time here this week, the food and atmosphere was just as good as the first time.  The schwarma wrap was flavorful and not dry. Love the baklava and salads as well. Nice music, very friendly staff  and relaxing atmosphere. Worth a stop!"}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean place in Scottsdale!  Excellent food and customer service!   I can't wait to go back... Everything tastes so fresh and authentic.  The best!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! My wife and I love this place so much. Being vegetarian, we always order the Falafel Wrap - it has been the same taste every time!!! And we couldn't leave without tasting the saffron ice cream and baklava---must try! The staff is friendly and will go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great food. The atmosphere is pleasing and the environment is quiet and clean. 

The food is clean and very tasty. We had the Salmon Kabob - highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The food was amazingly good!  Very reasonably priced!  Will definitely be our go to when we hit the movies.  5 Stars!  Great service too!  See you again!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Everything is very fresh and wonderful flavors.  We had the tzatziki as an appetizer, I had chicken kabob entree with rice & salad.  Very large portion for $11- less than fast food.  Husband had a gyro platter with rice & salad.  It was a deconstructed gyro, tons of delicious meat-&9.  Nice decor, clean.  Can't beat it! A bit hard to find in large center, but near Dick's Sporting Goods."}
{"text":"We have quickly become fans. We ordered in the restaurant and have ordered takeout twice so far. I love the quality of the Persian rice and the kabobs. I also like how conveniently the meals are packaged. We are planning to order individual meals and appetizers for a function. I am also looking to break from the habit of only ordering kabobs to try traditional dizin."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Roasted Eggplant is absolutely phenomenal!!!! This place is above rating. Everything is off the charts."}
{"text":"We wandered in here after the Phoenix film Festival. What a great find! We both had salmon which was grilled perfectly. All the vegetables that came with the dishes were very fresh and flavorful. The staff was very nice and the service was good. I am definitely looking forward to going back and would highly recommend this restaurant for a casual and unpretentious dining experience."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while running errands one afternoon.  Food was delicious, prices fair and the owners were lovely and accommodating.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I like this place far better than the Persian Room and the owners did a great job with the remodel...very nice!!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is nice. It's nicely located, nicely decorated, very nice portions. They only thing not nice, is the flavors, and that's only cause they're amazing. This place somehow never dissapoints me. I don't know why I don't get there more often though. Today i ordered the gyro meal, and it was right on point. It's gyro meat, with rice, salad, and even the gyro bread on the side. They give you butter, tzatziki sauce and Italian dressing. All fresh and delicious. I'm not a fan of tzatziki, because to me it's always just so blah... But not here though. This sauce is exploding with dill and lemon flavors. Really good. At $9 this dish is good value, so high score today. Service is done just right and I didn't have to wait long for my meal. I asked for an extra dressing  no fuzz about it, so just an easy going way to do Mediterranean"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. The atmosphere and food were both good. It was on the pricey side, especially for a self-serve, almost fast-food type place."}
{"text":"delicious shish kabob today we had the chicken and then an appetizer of hummus. Great place for lunch the folks here are very friendly"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Impeccable service. The colors of the place are just perfect and everything on this place looks always new and clean.

In addition the food presentation is perfect"}
{"text":"Bomb ass food! I would have posted pictures of my food, but it didn't make it that long. Also, the staff was very friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fresh and Delicious! Comfortable and relaxing atmosphere! Clean and modern! Chicken Kabob sandwich excellent! Chicken tender and salad with Champagne dressing yummy ! Family owned and operated!"}
{"text":"I've picked up dinner from this little place twice, and it was fantastic both times. The food is delicious (huge portions!) and the people who work there are so friendly, generous and accommodating. The last time I placed my order, I called it in (not knowing it was 10 min before closing time- oops!) and the man who answered (I think he was the manager/owner) insisted on staying late to accommodate my order. Great food from great people at a great price :)"}
{"text":"\"This place is awesome. Food is top rate, reasonable prices, clean, and very nice people running and working there.\""}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic Persian food. Friendly staff. Very simple and straightforward menu to choose from for non- Iranian customers."}
{"text":"Place was clean and the staff was friendly. Ordered the chicken and steak kabob plate..it was awesome. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Go there all the time.  Everything is awesome. Kobideh  is amazing and so is the chicken."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly disappointed by this place on many levels. I went here after seeing the good ratings on yelp but the food was average with small portions of meat and they did not have some basic things that should've come with the meal. After finishing the main course I had some soggy baklava.
I do not plan to return and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb shank special on Saturday with a side of grilled veggies and everything was delicious! The owners are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! It seems to never have enough tables available, which says a lot. I've also noticed a lot of people of Mediterranean descent eating here.  I've seen a few Mediterranean places not survive the valley, but I really hope this one does. It's far more than gyros. I've tried a couple of things and they've been done really well. Not dry, but perfectly seasoned and cooked so that it doesn't dry out."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Consistently great service. Kay is always upbeat and very helpful. My family has eaten here about once a month for the past 6 months, and we like it more every time!"}
{"text":"Dined here for late lunch w/friends after movie @ Harkins 101, brought hub here as we both like this type of food. Love the Gyro Platter and chicken kabob plate. Persian version of Baklava with rose water....tender & delicious.
Food is delicious, ample servings, excellent service, look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Clean, quick service and great food. I'll definitely go back. I liked the quality of the food as well. Kabob pieces were tender and juicy. People there are helpful and greet you with a great smile."}
{"text":"My beautiful wife and I were hungry after a recent movie and I am currently eating ketogenic so we went to try the kabob house again. It had been about a year since we had been here and we were surprised by the complete makeover. Now it is an upscale middle eastern restaurant. 

Service was excellent and the person helping us recognized we looked a little lost and explained that they had converted to the new place a year ago. It is very nice inside. Anyway on to the food. 

We tried the chicken kabob and steak
Kabob plates. We both had all salad although you could have rice instead. They seemed to have many different dishes but we wanted something quick to take home.  We waited about 5 minutes and headed home. Food was amazing. Chicken was flavorful and not dry. The steak was tender and also not dry. The salad was simple but fresh and nice variety. The only downside was the price. The 2 entries were about 27 dollars for the two. This is about 10 dollars more then the last time we ate there. True the food was better, but not by that much. Overall they delivered on the food and service which is what I rate on. I don't score down for price. 

Service 5/5. Food 4/5 for my wife and 5/5 for
Me. We will be back but not as often as if the price was lower."}
{"text":"I really wanted to write a 5-star review, but the food was just OK.  Hummus was a little bland and chicken slightly overcooked.  You can tell these folks know what they're doing, so I may try one more time in the event it was an off night."}
{"text":"Super yummy, fresh tasting and great portion size.  Really loved it."}
{"text":"The food was high quality at this restaurant but a little pricey.  The kid's meal was $7 and did not include a drink.  I had a greek salad, which was very fresh and my husband had a chicken pita, which he said was delicious.  Although we enjoyed the food, I would go here more often if the price was a little lower."}
{"text":"This place was very good. The interior is nice and clean with a shabby modern feel. I ordered the filet sandwich and it was so good. I stole a piece of chicken off my son's plate and omg! The chicken is amazing! I wish they had another location more west."}
{"text":"This is a small fast/casual middle east style eatery with very stylish decor. You order at the counter and seat yourself.

 I had the barberry rice and chicken. The white meat chicken was juicy and I liked the char taste on the chicken. The long grain rice was very fluffy and was studded with very tart barberries. The barberries were interesting I never had them before. The portion of the entrees are very large and they do give you a large portion of meat. You also get a pat of butter with the rice and sumac is on the table.

 We also shared the falafel appetizer. The falafels are very large and are not the crispy kind and are more of a meatball texture and are tasty.

The girl at the counter was friendly and helpful.

This restaurant is located across the street in that big shopping center from the Whole Foods on Mayo Blvd."}
{"text":"Went there today for the Gyro platter, Chicken Shwarma and Baklava. Everything was delicious, the decor was wonderful, everything was clean and the atmosphere felt right. Definitely worth a return trip or a first time visit if you haven't been there before."}
{"text":"I've never dined in, had take out twice and the food is delicious. You can the see the family back there cooking and so thats always a plus in my book ! The food is cooked to order and the portions are generous which may or may not be a good thing esp if you have no control around carbs ! The staff is always very friendly and courteous and from the limited time I was there the place has always been spotless."}
{"text":"I had looked at Yelp before coming here and the food looked amazing, so we decided to check it out for a late lunch. I ordered the Greek salad w/ chicken kabob Very very tasty, light and fresh. I also ordered the falafel, one of the best I have had. The establishment is very clean and the decor is cute."}
{"text":"Had the Gyro Platter and the Tzatziki appetizer, my wife had the Chicken Kabob. The gyro meat and the chicken were fantastic! They both came with a side salad and rice which were good too. The Tzatziki was pretty good but only came with one pita. My only suggestion is to provide more pitas with the appetizer.

All in all a delicious lunch for a good deal!"}
{"text":"Well prepared food, kind service, and a simple, clean ambience. Love the chicken kabob w Greek salad and the hummus is terrific. Had the best baklava I've ever had -- tasted like rose petals and honey! This is a great place to have dinner before catching a movie at Harkins."}
{"text":"We went to AZ Kabob House using a Groupon.  We had never been before and I cannot say enough good things about the food and service!  Absolutely delicious chicken (tender and flavorful) and lamb kabobs and generous portion of rice with a small side salad!  We also got a yogurt/cucumber/mint dip served with Pita bread which was wonderful!  Very attentive and friendly service, and very clean.  Highly recommended---we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and upscale restaurant with speed and cost of a bistro. Wish they had the yummy land shank every night"}
{"text":"I was just telling my mom about this, and I realized this was the best culinary surprise I've had, in a long time - the food I had was outstanding!

I had gone to the Scottsdale 101 anticipating eating at the Persian Grill that I used to really like. That place no longer exists, so I thought I would try the new place, even though I saw the dishes cost more than, it seems to me, \"fast food\" prices.

It was the right decision!

First I asked the person, I presume the owner, about vegetarian dishes. 

He suggested the Fesenjan, without meat. I had never heard of it, and I think the menu said it had walnuts and pomegranate, which sounded interesting. It was quite a tantalizing treat!

The service was good. (I do not know his name.) He was very friendly. And attentive. He initially asked whether I wanted half salad and half rice with the meal. I said I wanted all salad - it was great, as well. 

The meal also came with a pita, which I finished quickly. It was good. I asked him for more bread, and he brought me another (no extra charge).

The ambiance is pleasant, and feels appropriate to the cuisine.

This was mid-afternoon. Initially it was just me dining and a group of maybe eight to 12 people speaking another language. Then more people came in as I was almost finished. This place deserves \"Best of The Valley\" honors, and among all cuisines, not just Mediterranean.

Absolutely loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I used to live in Los Angeles, which had some of the best/authentic Persian restaurants.   I will be coming here for barberry rice from now on. Haven't found anything like this in Arizona so far. The chicken was also cooked to perfection. Their tzatziki was also really good.

The decor is pretty, very trendy, it kind of felt like I was eating over at a friends home. Super clean dining room and you order at the counter and they bring it out for you.

The baklava was really good too!"}
{"text":"We went there to order lunch carry out. This place is very clean and smelled nice unlike standard restaurants. The girl at the register was very polite and caring. with all that in our experience, the food was amazingly delicious. Loved it!we will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Customer service was outstanding.  The young man at the counter was very pleasant and courteous!  In a day an age when you think customer service is dead, this was quite refreshing.  The place is immaculate, and the chicken shawarma was outstanding.  I have found my new middle easter cuisine place!  Also I am a Disabled Veteran and they gave me a military discount and thanked me for my service!!  Can't say enough good stuff about this place."}
{"text":"Excellent Persian food. Family run and their pride in the business shows. Kabobs are cooked to order, prices are reasonable and the food is well plated.  The rice is fluffy and delicious.  This review is based on four visits. We usually order the Chicken Soltani (1 chicken kabob and 1 ground beef kabob) with half rice and half salad. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall just off of E Mayo and N Scottsdale, this clean and airy middle-eastern restaurant appeared full of promise.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, the menu on chalkboards on the wall was varied with chicken and lamb dishes - we were looking forward to a good meal.

In fact, my lamb skewers were quite good.  I was less impressed with the rice (dry and bland) and the salad (strips of lettuce similar to what you'd get at the sports bar next door), but it seemed perfectly adequate.  We were the only patrons at lunch, and the food came out quickly.

Too quickly as it turned out.  My colleague had ordered chicken skewers, and they were way underdone (nearly raw) which is both gross and not particularly food-safe  (not good). I won't be going back.  Undercooking the chicken was a really bad move."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the environment is welcoming. You should try the homemade saffron ice cream and Baghlava. It is soooo good. Also a good place to cater your parties."}
{"text":"Well this was not what I expected from AZ Kabob house! Very pleasantly surprised! I was thinking it was going to be like skewers, the other Mediterranean place that used to be there, but it was definitely better!
I loved the setup, the tables and lamps are adorable. Has a cool rustic feel which I am totally into. I did notice it smelled a tad funky when I went in there though. Not terrible but a bit off. Same with the bathrooms, except that smelled strongly of bleach. My only real complaint.
Lady working at the counter was awesome. She picked up on the fact that I'm a vegetarian and gave me suggestions. She recommended the pomegranate walnut stew which sounded great but I had just had a bunch of pomegranate at lunch so I decided maybe next time I would try it. I wanted to try a little bit of everything so I got the appetizer platter. It came with hummus, pita, vegetables, dolmas, and falafel. The hummus and falafel were the big winners here, but I totally could have used some tzatziki to dip the falafel in. I will for sure order some next time. The falafel had a good crisp texture and yummy flavor. The hummus was smooth and tasted excellent with everything on the platter. Pita bread was tasty too! I wasn't a huge fan of the dolmas and I totally burned my tongue on one which was annoying haha. My mom got a chicken skewer and loved it. I tried the rice it came with and it was very yummy! Also the prices here are not bad at all for a good quantity of food that is good quality. Can't wait to come back! Neither can my mom!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food that we ordered for take away.  The rice was so fresh and so flavorful and the kebobs were delicious.  Don't forget to order mast mousir with your meal, it's the perfect side."}
{"text":"Very healthy. I had the filet entree and it was great. The flavors were not too strong in anything. At the end, I had salad, grains, meat, etc. It was a full meal. It didn't take long for the food to come out and we were able to finish by the end of our lunch hour. I like the place too. Well lit and clean. Will come back again to try other items. I hope their gyro or schwarma is just as delicious."}
{"text":"Went in on a groupon and not disappointed.  Great kabobs and wraps - I did lamb wrap and the wife chicken sultani.  Both were delicious and served up as expected for a place like this.  Saffron ice cream was excellent too, though a bit of an acquired taste.  We're planning to go back on a Saturday to try their lamb shank special."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a regular \"go-to\" for my wife and I. The Boneless Chicken Kabob platter is a superb, well-rounded meal. Staff is friendly and polite. Restaurant is clean and never overly busy. We order here at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"Good food!  Quick, reasonably priced, very clean atmosphere and actively involved owners, we will be back.  We orders the Gyros plate and the lamb plate, both were very tasty.  
Owners are also actively involved.  
Great place to grab a quick dinner or lunch, especially before or after a movie."}
{"text":"I did not know it was there even though I could walk there from my work. Thank goodness for Groupon. We have been back here several times after using the Groupon for take-out. Very fresh food. Very good quality meat. Friendly staff & decent prices. We will go back again soon."}
{"text":"This has to be the best kept secret in Scottsdale! Living a very healthy lifestyle, think meal prep life lol it's hard to find places that serve quality and taste at a somewhat affordable price. With that being said this had to be the best salmon I've had in Arizona which says a lot with me being from New Jersey where the seafood is always fresh! Definitely a MUST try will recommend and be back most definitely. Another pleasant aspect was the front counter gentleman, made sure I was greeted and knew about the menu and was very helpful all around great experience."}
{"text":"Ordered this place from ubereats with my boyfriend, first time ever eating it. Excellent food ordered the Greek salad one with chicken and one with salmon, chicken kabobs and domas! Everything from the chicken to the rice tasted so fresh! Love this place and would recommend going there!!"}
{"text":"Great experience - clean restaurant with very good chicken and basmati saffron rice.  Healthy but tasty!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place and it was very good! I can't think of one negative thing to say about our food, service or atmosphere. My wife and I both had the fillet platter. Perfectly cooked steak, the rice was very light & fluffy, and the whole roasted tomato was perfect. We will for sure be going back."}
{"text":"Great food and I'm visiting from Chicago and the food is better here. Wish  they would open In Chicago. highly recommend the ice cream sandwich. Home made. Amazing."}
{"text":"Fast and flavorful. Portioned for two seniors to share. Walked in to last table at noon and a line formed with seemingly many regulars amid the visitors attending Phoenix Film Festival."}
{"text":"One of the best Shawarmas and Kabobs I have ever had in the country. On top of that the family staff that runs this place are extremely courteous and nice to all the customers. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The owners/ workers are the nicest people ever! They are so hospitable, the Resteraunt is always clean and very refreshing and bright to walk in. The chicken kabob, kobideh and the stews are to die for. I come here weekly and sometimes twice a week. I am so happy to have found this gem near my home and recommend anyone I know this is the best quality and freshest middle eastern food. Fatima :)"}
{"text":"On the outside it's just a strip mall kabob shop. On the inside it's a clean, bright and calming sage green and off white shabby chic counter service place with tasty food and quick friendly service. The prices are a bit steep for the size of the plates, but the food is well prepared, seasoned, and presented. They could stand to give you a few more pitas when you order one of the tasty dips (the yogurt cucumber dip is not to be missed)."}
{"text":"Love the Greek salad with gyro meet! The service is outstanding and super friendly plus it's always so clean in the dining area."}
{"text":"The Salmon kabob is perfectly prepared, perfect amount of spices and saltiness, clean food, not greasy and flavorful. 
Highly recommend for good, healthy and tasteful meal."}
{"text":"What the heck is wrong with people? The food is pretty good at AZ Kabob House, but the management/staff, not so much. 

My partner and I stopped by for lunch today (Sunday). We were ready to order, but the staff was too busy looking at something on a mobile phone in the back to take our order. When they finally noticed us they were cordial enough, but ignoring customers to surf the net on your phone is unacceptable.

Next, we're enjoying our Gyro platters (yes, the food is good) and another customer sits at the table next to us. He proceeds to put a football game on his mobile phone without using earbuds. So, the whole restaurant gets to listen to the game he's watching. What an inconsiderate boor. Of course the restaurant staff said nothing. 

Even though we enjoyed the food, the experience left a lot to be desired. And people, get some earbuds! I don't want to listen to your Facetime, Music, Game, TV Show, Netflix, etc. Just because you enjoy it doesn't mean I will. Even if you repeatedly lose them, Amazon has a four-star rated pair for $5.99 each with Prime delivery. Buy them, put them in your ears and save us all from your boorish behavior."}
{"text":"Had an awesome breakfast cum brunch. 
Staff is very warm and courteous and delicious food"}
{"text":"The food here is just phenomenal! The simplicity in it, authenticity; the ambiance of this establishment is just top notch. One of my top 5 favorite places!"}
{"text":"I am not shy about pointing out restaurants with inflated ratings! The four and a half star rating for AZ Kabobs I am happy to say is not inflated. This little jewel is worth every star and more. With fresh kebabs, great  rice and  reasonable prices!
The ambience is terrific, and the service is quite pleasant! Check this place out!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after watching a movie at the nearby movie theatre. The restaurant is clean and surprisingly very cute. You walk up to the counter to place your order, sit down and the food is dropped off. The cashier was very friendly and welcoming. 

We ended up ordering the chicken and ground beef kabob platter with rice and salad. It was enough for me and my hubby to share and the taste was good. We practically ate everything on the plate. The reasons why I give four instead of five is that they were out of a few items that I wanted to order and the price is a little on the high side. For one combo platter and one drink, we paid almost $20."}
{"text":"My new favorite \"fast food\" restaurant. Order your Middle Eastern yumminess at the counter and then find a table in the sunny, serene restaurant complete with relaxing music to listen to. The gyro plate was soon good, with delicious gyro meat, Greek salad, and saffron rice. The creamy textured babaganoush is probably the best I've ever tasted. My friend got a gorgeous big chicken Kabob salad and loved it. The service was excellent as well. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! We came from out-of-town to a tournament and found this place by casualty, so recommended! Service, ambience and even music were great."}
{"text":"This place taste exactly like the Persian Room but for cheaper! My meal was cooked perfectly and it was large enough for left overs. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff...enjoyed fresh delicious food...I ordered beef soltani and it was very good..I highly recommend it...I will be back again :)"}
{"text":"Service is great here, it was my first visit and the cashier was so helpful with guiding me through the menu. I got the chicken filet entree with half rice half salad and added filet mignon, all togo. He offered water while I waited which was nice. The chicken was delicious with good flavor, just a tiny bit dry, tho I wasn't disappointed. The filet mignon was ok but they made it well done.. I wish that they would have asked how I wanted it prepared. Maybe they don't prepare it any other way but well done? It was also really drenched in butter or some kind of grease. Inside the box there was also a little packet of butter that they stuck between the rice and the pita bread which melted all over the place and was dripping into the rice cause the food was hot. Please leave that out/on the side! 

I think that for what I paid here, the quality I got and the portion I received compared to the Persian Room, it would be 3.5 stars but I will round up for that chicken!"}
{"text":"AZ Kabob is a consistently great restaurant!  The food and service are wonderful!  It is a family favorite.  We catch lunch there almost every other week and we also go before going to the Cine Capri.  It is a great value for the amount of food not to mention it is delicious!  You are missing out if you don't give it a try.  I promise you will want to go back."}
{"text":"Great spot! Delicious falafel pita wrap. Loved that it came with a side salad with finely chopped peppers, tomatoes, and cucumbers. The food came out quick and was priced well. The interior is pretty chic, cool vibe! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and really good food!  Hummus with pita was good.  Sounds weird but really good rice."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Persian food lately. How is it, that it's only recently that I've come to enjoy it? I've only had one visit at AZ Kabob so far and was hesitant to write a review based on that one visit, but that visit was enough to lead me to believe that I've found myself a new favorite place. 

I first heard of AZ Kabob by skimming through Yelp for nearby restaurants. Thank you Yelpers! AZ Kabob had 92 reviews at the time with an average of 4-1/2 stars. A convincing rating! It was easy to locate it using the Google Maps app on my phone. Thank you modern technology! I walked in and was greeted with a very clean, modern layout. I already had a good idea of what I wanted to order prior to visiting and that was the Combination Platter, which included 1 skewer each of chicken, lamb, Koobideh (ground beef), and fillet. I was given the option of a side of rice or salad or half of each. I chose half of each. The dish also comes with warm, soft pita bread and rice. I ordered it as take-out and only had to wait somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes. I was also the only patron there at the time so that helps with the speed of preparation. I had the privilege of keeping this aromatic pleasure in my car with windows shut as I drove home. Needless to say I was very excited to experience the dish when I got home.

AZ Kabob House is only the second Persian restaurant I've been to ever and the rice in both restaurants have had the best rice I've every had. This comes from someone whose been eating rice since probably since I was a baby. The rice is very fluffy. It looks like they add saffron and butter. All four skewers were so tender, warm, and full of flavor. I loved soaking up the juices at the bottom of the container and enjoyed 4 different flavors and textures of meat. The Combination Platter is supposed to feed 3 to 4 people. I would say that's accurate, but it was so good that I probably ate for two people. The only part of the dish that survived before the day was over was the salad. 

I'm definitely going to come back and am excited to try all the other dishes!"}

Love the quality ,
Highly recommended ,

{"text":"The food here is excellent. Fresh, delicious Mediterranean/Persian right here in Scottsdale. Everything is made to order and the portions are generous. Service is attentive and helpful for a walk-in and order at the counter restaurant. We are so glad we came here for dinner. Thank you AZ Kabob House!!"}
{"text":"Food and service are always great! Even my little kids love it here. So nice to have something authentic in the area."}
{"text":"Try the Chicken Shawarma Wrap!! The best!!!! They have good service and amazing atmosphere! Would def come back again!"}
{"text":"I got to try this gem on a Saturday for lunch. I heard that this location recently went through a manager change and the new owners renovated the place. The  restaurant has a very clean and inviting vibe. The staff is very friendly and ready to answer any questions. 

Food was also great. I ordered a Greek salad with chicken and hubby had the gyro platter with rice and salad. The portions were big and food was fresh and flavorful. My chicken was very tender and I would definitely order that again. 

The business model is order your food at the counter, no service, clean up after yourself, but I feel like the prices don't reflect that fast food type model and that's the only critique that I have. The menu items are rather on the pricey side. 

Tip: make sure to try their home made baklava. They are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here today. We started with a hummus appetizer that came with freshly made (warm!) flat bread. Yum! Then I had a falafel wrap, which came with a delicious small Greek side salad. Everything was so fresh! My husband had the giros plate with rice, which he said was also delicious. And, of course, we ended the meal with baklava, which was perfect! I highly recommend this restaurant. Oh, yes, everything was clean as a whistle, including the bathroom!"}
{"text":"I just came here from iran the food is authentic. Tonight was my first time i came here,,,, soooooo delicious food I've ever had in Phoenix for kabab ,,,  kheyli kheyli kababesh aliii bood"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the experience eating here. The dining room is wet clean and well kept. The service was good without being overbearing. The woman at the front counter was very nice.

And the food is really good! I only tried the ground beef kabob and gyro and both were yummy. The ground beef kabob was juicy with the right amount of spices. The only thing I wish they had was a gyro salad, but I imagine you could ask for it specially made. I also wish some of the items were a little more affordable for lunch."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh, and authentic Mediterranean food!  Great service!  Will be back often."}
{"text":"Very quick service and delicious gyro wraps in pita bread."}
{"text":"Ok, just making my way to all the Persian restaurants in Arizona and I have found my guilty pleasure kabobs- AZ Kabob is the creme de la crop of Persian kabob eateries!  To start, let's talk about teasers- I mean, appetizers ;) We had the shallot yogurt or \"maste moosir\" in Farsi....yummmmm!  It was perfect- creamy and delicious.  I had the \"chenje\" or beef cubes. To die for!  I mean, I asked it to be well done & it was nothing short of phenomenal! Moist & tender & decadent!!  Can we talk dessert??  I can't believe I had enough room for dessert. We had the Persian ice cream- pistachios, saffron, rosewater, cardamon- angels were singing all around me!!  Loved it from start to finish. My compliments to the chef Mr. Aref!  He is awesome! And my compliments to the owner, Mr. Armen- so warm, welcoming, & exceptional!  If I could, I would give this eatery 10 stars!!  I will be back weekly ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Just came across it recently and tried their Deezee!! Real good Persian food. The best part is, they are 10 mins walking distance from us ;)
Great and friendly service. Very clean.

Highly recommending this place."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent visitor here. I would often visit after working out from the gym across the street. I'm Persian heritage and decided to give this place my business as a alternative to Persian Room (PR). 

The quality of the food is substantially lesser than Persian Room. I enjoyed this place because it was decently good and at a much less price than PR. However the price for a beef koobideh is $9. The catch is it is only one skewer of beef and half a tomato! When you add an extra skewer and the other half of your original tomato you get up to $15!

Just spend the extra few back to go to PR and get your huge 2 skewer tomato and rice at base price without all the add on charges.

Didn't offer yelp coupon either."}
{"text":"I can't tell you how many times i've driven past AZ Kabob House... Recently after a long Saturday morning workout, I was looking for something that was healthy but different from my usual salad joints. 

The restaurant itself is cute and airy, our cashier was super sweet and attentive. We started with an order of their hummus which was creamy and delicious... I got a greek salad with a ground beef kabob. The Salad was flavorful and the kabob was delicious as well. It was quick, delicious, and price was on point.

Def a great spot for delicious and quick persian food!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! First time here. Had the boneless chicken kabob with half rice and salad. The dressing is on the side and is really good. The chicken had a pleasant mild flavor, pita warm and soft and rice was great and not overly seasoned. Basically a very non threatening meal and be sure to use your Yelp check in discount on the Yelp phone app.
**Update**
Well, as you can see from my check-ins I am hooked on this place.  I come every week &  always get a quality meal.  They have online ordering as well.  Love putting their hot sauce on everything, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great food and clean restaurant but expect to wait for the food when they are busy!
Good location near movie theater.
Staff friendly.
I have been here about 8 times and always good"}
{"text":"Wanted something different for dinner. Found this restaurant on Yelp and gave it a go. I haven't had Kabobs since leaving California 20 years ago and this place hit my heart strings. 
We started off with Baba Ganosh which was OK and served with 1 pita. 
I had the Chicken Soltani and my wife had the Chicken Kabob. Everything was fresh. The rice was nice and fluffy and the chicken and beef Kabob was wonderful, tasty and served at a nice temperature."}
{"text":"After working at a Persian restaurant back in California I must say that I was a little worried going here, my standards were pretty high... I ordered the Joojeh with rice and a shirazi salad, my boyfriend ordered the koobideh 1/2 1/2. Everything was AMAZING. The chicken was juicy, the rice was so fluffy. They even let me make iced Persian tea (which was also delicious) 

We will definitely go back!! 
I'm hoping tomorrow ..."}
{"text":"Took home some persian food from this restaurant last Sunday. Food was really good! definately a great place when you don't feel like going to a very formal restaurant as Persian room. The restaurant is a great alternative to Pita Jungle, it is not fast food, it's a relaxed atmosphere type of restaurant."}
{"text":"Delish! Generous portions and really tasty. We dined with a two year old. Toddlers are a rough crowd. He loved the boneless chicken kabobs, filet kabobs and rice. The filet was tender and flavorful. The chicken kabobs were equally tender and when paired with a fresh Mediterranean salad the meal left us satisfied but not feeling blah.

The restaurant is hospital clean with ambiance to boot! Well done, AZ Kabob!"}
{"text":"Great food, clean, beautifully decorated, friendly staff and reasonable prices!!! Love their Kabobs!!!
Next time will try the stews!!! My husband and I love the place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Very friendly and welcome staff. The food is scrumptious and definitely my weekly treat from now on. The rice is flavorful and perfect. The grilled lamb melts in your mouth and the Persian tea is smooth as silk. Thank you for opening this restaurant. My palate appreciates the delicious foods. Fresh baklava to go for me. My daughter ate all her salad and that's a first!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place.   I had a gyro wrap, it was so good.   A little messy but yummy.  The only thing I would change would be the sauce for gyro was on the side and kind of thick.  Still really fresh and delicious however.  Cute little restaurant.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! We had the deezee and gyro platter and the food was fresh and tasted great. Will definitely come back for more in the near future."}
{"text":"Take it from an Iranian, BEST authentic Persian food north of South Mountain! Closest thing to mom's cooking. I get the maast o moosir every time I go, too good to pass up. 
My boyfriend and I were going to another Persian place just south of here until they told us there was a 2 hour wait! We looked up other Persian restaurants and found this place just down the street. Ever since, we can't settle for anywhere else. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"Hands down THE BEST Persian restaurant in Arizona! Everything is so fresh and tasty, lamb kabob is tasty and you can't miss their Saffron ice cream."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a few times, and each time, we have been very impressed with the food, service, atmosphere, and prices. There is so much to choose from, with the food always being healthy and hearty. My personal favorites are the various kabobs, while my wife and daughters love the shawarmas and soltanis. Make sure to try the Persian ice cream sandwich, which is filled with delicious saffron ice cream. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok. We came here after reading the great reviews. Still, my expectations were low and we ordered pretty much most items on the menu. I must say, the falafel was as crunchy and you'd expect, but the chicken was outstanding along with the Persian style rice. Grape leaves were superb and the beef succulent. Still, my most favorite dish was the chicken kabob. 
Run don't walk."}
{"text":"AZ Kabob House is one of the new genre of small specialty restaurants where you order at a counter and your food is brought to your table.  It looks a lot like Coconuts, clean, bright, new, with upscale tables and comfortable chairs.  Service is fast (at least when it isn't too crowded) and polite.

AZ Kabob House differs from other such establishments primarily in menu and price.  The menu here is fairly large, with several stews, four types of kabobs in various combinations, six appetizers, plus specialties, sides and drinks.  The prices are almost what you would pay at a table service restaurant ($13 for an average size kabob).

It comes down to the quality of the food - so from what we tried, here it is:
Hummous - Too much tahini, and little or no garlic, salt, or lemon.  Boring.  The pita was uninspired.
Chicken Kabob - Well prepared but very little flavor (needs seasoning).
Filet Kebob - If this was filet, it was the toughest filet I have ever eaten.  Also no flavor.
Rice - Not exceptional but the best thing on the plate.
Salad - About as exciting as a McDonald's side salad.

This sounds awful, but actually the food wasn't bad -- it just wasn't particularly good.  I think AZ Kabob House should adopt a food truck mentality and strive to make what they cook memorable."}
{"text":"First and last time trying this place: came in at noon, place was dead with one couple ahead of me. Placed an order for kobiedeh, half rice half salad. Lunch crowd came in as I sat down. They said they'd bring my food to me, so I'm head down in my phone. 20 minutes pass. I look up, there are six tables that all came in after me with food, with nothing but an overpriced 2 dollar bottle of water (Nestlé) in front of me. I go up to the counter, as I was unable to flag someone down as they brought yet another table their food... inquire as to where my lunch is; \"what did you order again?\"  Then, Voilà, out comes my lukewarm ground beef kabob, with an undressed salad and no sauce for the kabob (granted none was promised, but whenever I've gotten Persian or Turkish food I've always received at least one sauce...).  Best thing that can be said for the food was I don't think it will make me sick (kitchen was very clean and well organized), and the rice was alright. So do yourself a massive favor, and keep walking on over to cafe Pino..."}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered from this restaurant via uber eats. I ordered my husband the gyro sandwich with a side of fries. The driver obviously did not check the order upon pick up because this is definitely not a sandwich. What we got is a pile of gyro meat and a soggy side of uncooked fries. Yuck! Going straight in the garbage! My Greek salad with chick has literally 3 pieces of chick, 4 olives, and 2 peppers. How was this place gotten so many good reviews? Serious disgusting.

Adjusted to reflect management review: 
I appreciate your comment but it was not Uber's issue. In fact, I called your restaurant  before I posted this review and had the most horrible customer service. I was told that the food was just fine and that there was absolutely nothing they would do for me. The reason I posted the review is because of the horrible customer service and the bad food. I understand that when you're ordering from a delivery service your feet might need to be reheated upon receiving it. That is not the issue if the fries where cooked, you would be able to tell they were cooked and they would just be cold that was not the issue they were a soggy mess and my euro was just me did not come with any bread vegetables etc. that would make it a sandwich. So you have two issues number one that the food was not as ordered and number two horrible customer service. And let me just be clear the person who answered the phonedad asked to speak to the manager and that manager is a person that supposedly told him there was nothing they could do for me."}
{"text":"I tell you what. I love Mediterranean food. My wife is okay. She hasn't had that great of experiences cause every time she orders chicken it's really dry. Over cooked. So I finally talked her into trying AZ Kabob. 

Came here on a rainy Friday night. Walk in and I'm very surprised. Very modern decor. Very clean. My wife loved the lighting fixtures. The menu is on the wall. Very big so you can't miss. 

Anyways, the guy at the counter greeted us and was very friendly. He knew we were new and helped us out and gave recommendations to us. 

We both ordered the boneless chicken Kabob entree which comes with either rice or salad or half n half. We both got all Salad. 

Anyways, waited at our table which had all the metal silverware at the table with napkins. Very convenient. Our food came out surprisingly fast. I was surprised cause they had so much to go orders but hey who's complaining. Not me

So we get eight medium sized chicken kabobs on top of a bed of salad with the salad dressing on the side. Salad had greens with diced tomatoes and cucumbers. Poured the salad dressing all over and wow. Really good. Fresh greens. Fresh tomatoes. Fresh cucumbers and juicy chicken. Cooked perfectly. Finally found a places that know how to cook the chicken right so it's not dry. Very moist. Very tasty. I would say the salad dressing really makes the dish. It's a combination of Italian and Champagne dressing. Really good. Not to strong. Not bitter. Really love the dressing. Really loved the total entree. Excellent 

The place is very open. Very modern. Very welcoming. Loved the ceiling fans. Only issue I could find it that's it's so quiet. People come eat and it's like a library. Only noise is from the kitchen but they are not that loud. Would suggest some type of music to break up the quietness. 

So I really enjoyed this place. Finally found a Mediterranean place that my wife enjoyed. She even talked about trying other menu items too. This is a first. She likes one thing and sticks to it. Not to adventurous. So this says a lot about this place if my wife wants to return. 

Tell you what. We will be back and can't wait to try other menu items. Really good. Enjoy. We did"}
{"text":"I did stopped after had my hair done, i did ordered the the shirazi salad and asked to add some chicken, I got big piece of chicken it came to $12 its a little pricey but it was delicious. the place is neat and nice, service was good too. Will be back thats for sure."}
{"text":"Had the gyro platter.. Said saffron rice.. But was just white with a couple of sprinkles of saffron .. I would t be calling this saffron rice. Gyro meat was great .. Will go back just won't get rice"}
{"text":"This place really is good. Persian food fresh and flavorful. I've been for lunch a few times. Simple, order at the counter, they bring your food. Great hummus, chicken, and salads. You still feel good after you eat and that it was a healthy choice. If you want a  new mediterranean place give it a try."}
{"text":"Reviews were right! The food is amazing - well seasoned, fresh, and a complete adventure. Basmati rice was cooked to perfection. Chicken, ground beef kabob, & salmon all full of flavor snd juicy. Large food portions. Place is clean and service on point. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is just the place I was looking for! Freshly grilled meat and nicely seasoned salad at a great price. We had many places like this in Brooklyn and I was glad to find one in Phoenix. A pleasant space to eat in. The service is once and meets are fresh and flavorful. A great place for a take out or a low key meal when no one wants to cook."}
{"text":"Very nice little casual eatery.  Intimate setting but very flavorful dishes.  I tried the chicken shwarma and it was delicious.   Great prices and the service was reasonably quick as well."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, welcoming staff and stellar food. Try the Greek salad with gyro meat!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. Service was great and the food was pretty good. I had the chicken sultani which was pretty flavorful. Had the saffron ice cream afterwards. It's a bit of an acquired taste but I think it's worth a try. We'll definitely be back to try other stuff!"}
{"text":"I love everything and I tasted all the foods but you should try their chicken shawarma it's amazing it was the best chicken shawarma that I have ever had"}
{"text":"Tried it before going to the movies since it's so close and convenient. The atmosphere is pretty cool, it's clean and modern and feels homey. They have table that resemble dinning tables. 
However the food was not as good, it was bland and the portions are quite small. My bf got the filet and I got the lamb entree and you can choose either rice , salad or half and half. The dressing wasn't very good, generic Italian dressing. The roasted tomato didn't have any flavor. They gave a very small amount of meat, for 13$ at least give 2 kabobs and not just 1... 
won't be coming back any time soon. Food lacks a lot of flavor. Just was not filling either. 
2 stars for the environment and customer service."}
{"text":"What a great little treasure. It's fast Mediterranean food in a unique relaxing environment. And the food is absolutely wonderful. Their dressings and spices are a delightful blend that we thoroughly enjoyed and will bring us back to try other dishes! What a nice New Year find!"}
{"text":"Loved the Greek Salad with Chicken Kabob - super fresh, healthy and delicious. The chicken was very moist, tender and flavorful with the perfect amount of grill char."}
{"text":"I ordered their zereshk polo and chicken kabob plate, which came with a nice amount of boneless kabob pieces, about a third of a plate of salad, and two small pieces of pita bread. While it wasn't bad by any means, it wasn't the best Persian food I've had in the area. I also asked at the counter if I could have a hot tea with my meal (which is actually a common request for a Persian restaurant), and they told me they don't make it because it's too hot outside.. people are still drinking coffee and tea as far as I know, and I found it to be a strange response. I wouldn't have commented about this if it wasn't clearly depicted on the menu as an option, and I didn't find the answer so questionable. So overall, I just found the vibe of the employees to be a little off-putting, but I wouldn't call that a reason to not eat here. Personally, though, I prefer the place a few blocks down Scottsdale road (which also has much larger portions)."}
{"text":"What a fabulous find!!  The place is small but the flavor is huge!  We went as a family of four, with two children ages 15 & 10, and ordered the Family Special ($35).  It was touted to feed 3-4 and I might agree with that, IF my children were younger.  For us, it fed three adults well without over eating. The platter contained ground beef kebobs, chicken, and sirloin with the option of splitting the sides between rice and a salad. OMG!!  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  The rice was fluffy and light and the salad was perfect!!  My little guy got the Kids' grilled chicken and rice.  Same chicken and rice as our Family Platter, minus the salad.  Absolutely fantastic food!!  A must for any foodie with a craving for Mediterranean/Persian.  I would definitely return to try the falafel, dolmas, and the desserts!"}
{"text":"Got take out from here and they were very friendly and fast! I got the gyro wrap and it came with a salad. The salad was not as chopped as I had hoped it would be---the red onions came in large rings. The gyro wrap was delicious though! Flavor was amazing. Definitely hit the spot! The price isn't bad either. It was $8 plus tax without a drink. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Took a quick family vacation to the Scottsdale area and found this Gem. Great food and staff is very nice and polite. 
Extra points for having a baby changing table in restroom"}
{"text":"First of all, let me say the decor is really nice!! Totally unexpected when opening the door of a strip mall restaurant!! 
But decor is one thing, let's talk about the food. I had the falaffel wrap and it was delicious.  The pita was soft, fresh and I can only assume homemade though I didn't ask. But as good as any pita I have had in the valley. The falaffels were fantasic, great seasoning, cooked perfectly, crispy but not overdone. 
My wife had the chicken kabob pita and while I didn't taste it, she was thrilled with it. Great seasoning and flavor according to her. 
The only knock, and the only reason for the missing star was the fries.  They seemed to be just blanched, and were pretty tasteless. Guess I will go salad instead of fries next time, and yes, there will be a next time!!! Gyro will be next. 
But they also had a fantastic looking menu of other items beyond your usual gyro and falafel which I will definitely work my way into. 
The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. 
If you are looking for some quality Mediterranean food, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"About a month ago I was on a business trip to Scottsdale and I had a craving for Persian food. I had already satisfied my In N' Out craving earlier in the day and now I was on a mission to find good Persian food for dinner. I did my usual Yelp research and came across AZ Kabob House... glad I did! 

I've had Persian/Iranian food across the country and more importantly, in Iran. I have to say this was truly some of the best I've had. You can tell it's a family run restaurant and that they care about the quality of food they serve. I ordered the Kabob Soltani and when it comes to Persian food, the following is key. The quality and mix of the beef used for their koubideh and then the juiciness (fat mix) of the koubideh. After that comes how well it's cooked, can't overdo it and dry out the meat, it needs to be perfectly cooked where it's still juicy, but at the same time, not undercooked. They nailed it! Also super important is rice, this comes down to the quality of the rice they buy, how they prepare it and how long the rice has been sitting. Some places serve day old rice and it kills the meal. There needs to be a certain \"fluff\" to a good rice and again they nailed it. 

Love this place and can't wait to make it out to Arizona again to try it once again."}
{"text":"WOW! Our tastebuds are revelling in the best fesenjan we've ever had. For the uninitiated that's a pomegranate seed based  sauce that is found in great Persian and southern Russian food. Served with a good salad and fit for a shah. The owner is friendly. The staff are pleasant. The ambience is cute, simple but pleasing. We will have to return and try the deezee, a wonderful lamb dish."}
{"text":"If you're on the mood for Persian food go here! Support this cute mom and pop establishment. Plus the food is delish. Quick and super fresh with decent portions. The rice is so good. Mmmmm....My filet kebab was very tender. I tried my coworker's salmon plate and it was amazing! Wow! Totally getting that next time!! This is the perfect place when you don't have time to sit down at Persian room :) We loved it and we will be back soon! Can't believe it took us this long to find it! It's located right between the movie theatre and sports authority next to a hot dog place.  Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken shawarma in town! Every thing has authentic flavors including Taziki dip. 

This place is great for lunch. Had very reasonable prices and food was super! What else can you ask for."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and baba ganouj via Ubereats and it was delivered right to my door in about 30 minutes. I have never been to the restaurant's location in person but the food I had was absolutely full of flavor and tasted fantastic. Glad I tried them! Thank you Az Kabob House and UberEats !"}
{"text":"Not a bad little place if you are heading into a movie. It is a relatively healthy little arrangement for 1/10 the time as the more tastey finer dining of Persian room right down the street. Eat here if your in a hurry and Persian room if you have all the time to really enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"this place is yummy and the guys at the counter are very nice.

i had the beef kabobs and it was yummy! if you check in, they give you 1 dollar off so thats good. however if you wanted some sour cream, they charge you 75 cents each so basically with the dollar you save, you give it back for the sauce. lol either way this place is good."}
{"text":"Stopped by for take out. Friendly & helpful service, as this was our first time here. Food was fantastic. My daughter ordered the Gyro Wrap and said \" Ten out of ten!\" We would all agree with her! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome kabobs!!! Restaurant inside is really nice and comfortable. Try the chicken shawarma, really good. The portions are huge. Make sure you try the baklava, best ever."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, great. Delicious combos - eg. Gyro with rice, salad, pita and hummus. Yum!"}
{"text":"My families second visit here and again everything was perfect ! Best Persian food in Arizona and this is coming from a Persian girl! Portion are perfect price is amazing food is absolutely delicious ! Today we got these at 8:40 20 minutes before closing and they served us and allowed us eat with no rushing ! Will defiantly return many many more times !"}
{"text":"Fabulous chelo kabob! Barg is delicious and saffron pistachio ice cream sandwich is to die for. Clean,  reasonably priced and friendly. I love this place."}
{"text":"Really great food.  Portion sizes are right and the flavors are great.  The pita was some of the best I've had,  the falafel was perfect.  Fun decor and good ambiance.  Would love to come back when we are back in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This small modern setting was perfect for lunch and casual dinner.  Counter service with Great selection of Persian delicacies made with fresh flavorful ingredients.I would definitely return !"}
{"text":"First time here, happened by chance while looking for restaurants.  Persian cuisine...sounded new and promising.  The waiter was very kind and helpful.  We tried Fesenjan with chicken.  Unique, a gem we hadn't ever seen before.  Verrrry good.  Like a chicken stew, and I ate a bowl of it, and half of my son's bowl of it.  The salad that we got had a light citrus-like dressing on it.  The service was great, and the food was also.  We were visiting from out of town, and probably won't have the opportunity to return on this trip to Phoenix to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Thank you Uber Eats for bringing this deliciousness. Kabob platter, chicken shawarma wrap and the eggplant appetizer...all delicious!!!! Can't wait to order again"}
{"text":"A must try! We got the baba ganoush app and it was the best I ever had. Smoky eggplant and Not bitter like other places. I got the gyro platter and my hubby had the chicken soltani plate, both were excellent. Meat is really juicy, rice is fluffy and Greek salad had the the right toppings. Finished up with the saffron ice cream which ended the meal perfectly."}
{"text":"Some things I liked, some I didn't . The rice, salads and portion sizes were great. The chicken breast was tough and overcooked.  The setting was clean and peaceful with relaxing music in the background. I just didn't walk out of there thinking I had this great meal."}
{"text":"Very trendy little Mediterranean restaurant in north Scottsdale. After two visits, I'm ready to say that I love their chicken kabob. Very tender and oh-so-flavorful. The roasted tomato and side salad are great. The barberry rice adds tartness to the meal, and I don't think I could go back to the plain rice now. The tzatziki was fresh and a generous serving. However, it came with only one pita (cut into 4 pieces). I'm not sure if you're supposed to ask for more, but it definitely wasn't enough pita bread for the dip, and whether or not extra pitas were available on request was not posted on the menu. The lamb kabob was tender as well, and the gyro meat platter was another good choice. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner, and it's a convenient fast casual choice if you are headed to a movie."}
{"text":"This place closes at 8:00 but we walked in at 7:55. They still took our order! Another guy walks in after us and guess what? They took his order too. Amazing customer service. Food is always right on. I recommend their lamb and beef kabobs. They are full of flavor and it comes with big portion of rice, pita and always fresh salad. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Fairly new spot in this area. Very clean nicely decorated restaurant. All of the food looked excellent. I got the gyros platter with half rice and Greek salad. Nice sized portions and everything was made to order. fresh ingredients made with care."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Every time I come to this place, I know I will be well taken care of and the food will always be a hit! I've never had a bad experience and I highly recommend it to anyone with a craving for quality food made with the best ingredients. The owner is wonderful as well and they make the best baklava!"}
{"text":"Fresh, perfectly seasoned, and well portioned.  We highly recommend this restaurant for a lunch date on a sunny afternoon on their porch or for a quick take-out anytime.  An appetizer and two dishes would be perfect for most couples.

You must try their Falafel appetizer.  We are accustomed to Falafel cooked as rounded portions.  The Falafel here is prepared in little doughnut shapes that we now prefer.  Add fresh diced veggies and a perfect tzatziki sauce for a refreshing start to your meal.  Both the lamb and gyro plates came with half portions of rice and Greek salad.  We loved both dishes.  Combine all of this with friendly employees and you get five stars."}
{"text":"Chicken kebab and rice are excellent! Skip the hummus, it was very bland. I also got the baklava here once. I do not know what traditional baklava is supposed to be like but this one was not sweet at all, and it seemed dry with not enough syrup. I will return again and again for the chicken and rice. Best chicken Ive had in a very long time! So juicy and perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's been on my mind like everyday. Can't wait to visit for my birthday!"}
{"text":"Very clean inside. I had a koobideh on the Greek salad and it was excellent. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant but the owner was nice enough to accommodate 19 people. There are no reservations. I felt that the koobideh did not have as much flavor as I had hoped. Their rice was perfect. I expected more from the yogurt drink because it was quite watery. They offer generous portion sizes and give extra tzatiziki sauce for free. Note that you can't substitute rice with fries. Also the restaurant smelled like cigarette smoke so be wary of that."}
{"text":"I really love their food!  There aren't very many great Mediterranean restaurants in the southwest and everytime I eat there, which tends to be often since it's across the street from work, the foods is always great! Big portions! Awesome Taziki! Yum!! Plus their staff is always very friendly."}
{"text":"Drove by here after shopping in the area and thought we'd give it a try.  The service is great - the young man at the counter was very informative, friendly and patient with us.  I ordered the steak & chicken kabob platter and it was really good.  The saffron rice was so light and fluffy.  I will definitely be coming back."}
