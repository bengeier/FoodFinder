{"text":"Hopefully you can trust me on this one - I work in the area, and unfortunately and stupidly have returned because it's super close and on a hot day, the beer is cold.  Cold only. 

More than once, the beer tastes flat, or like vinegar.
More than once, the service (usually during the day and just after work) is atrocious and beyond aloof.  I like to believe a server is casual and relaxed when serving, but this place truly sucks.

Take yesterday for example: two people sat down near me (from Germany, perhaps Holland - couldn't make out the accent) at about 4pm.  They ordered wheat beer, and before they could sit to enjoy themselves, the female server began by loudly speaking about what a wheat beer is - AS THOUGH SPEAKING LOUD WOULD MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND BETTER - you asshole.  Then, the server asked for ID - fair enough.  HOWEVER, their ID was not good enough - even though it had a valid date on it.

The girl asked, what's wrong?  The server continued in a loud voice telling her that Ontario has strict liquor laws (yes, that's true), but are you seriously giving these two quiet people a hard time when all they've asked for is a beer to drink on the hottest fucking day of the year? They were amazed and flushed that a server could be that rude and curt, and in such a condescending manner.

SCRUFFY MURPHY's - your servers' attitudes are unacceptable and embarrassing.  

I stopped on my way out to speak to the couple to assure them that having a cold beer anywhere else on Eglinton would be much more welcoming."}
{"text":"Food was great ! Service was amazing! 
I met a few friends here for food and drinks one rainy night . It was really a pleasant surprise. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"It's a bar. Nothing special, but good place to grab a beer and some pub grub. Comfortable and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place has such a high rating. I have been here numerous times, and the service has been terrible every single time. I shouldnt have to wait 15 minutes to get a menu and then another 15 minutes to get a drink. 

I have come with a group, with a friend and on a date - and the staff gives off such a smug vibe - like if you are not a regular, what are you doing here type of feel.
The bar itself is run-down, dirty washrooms and carpets, its best to go at night so you cant see the grime! The food is pretty good though, will give them that and drink specials are great. 

For being one of the only bars now on that stretch of Eglinton - step up your game! The bar is obviously understaffed and the staff that are there clearly are not trained in proper customer service. I go to the Pickle Barrel for drinks now."}
{"text":"Felt like a comfy traditional pub.  Dark wood everywhere.  Surprisingly well lit for a pub, which I quite liked.

Went on a Monday when they have trivia night.  I'm usually pretty critical of comedians, but the host of trivia night was pretty amusing.  He does occasionally curse on the mic, which I didn't mind, but just FYI if you're bringingthe clergy.  First round trivia winners get a pitcher of beer.

Their beers on tap are pretty standard for the GTA; no super intriguing imports on tap.

The server was nice and cheery. HOWEVER, she was uneducated about some food I ordered.  I ordered the Haddock Finger appetizer.  I specifically asked if it is made like traditional fish and chips that are dipped batter; I was told yes that the only difference is that there is chipotle tartar sauce instead.  I did enjoy them (very moist), but was irked since it was my birthday and I was treating myself to fried food that I rarely eat and come to find out it is just a flour dredged spiced breaded and not what I had been craving.  Comes with a side a fries, which is not stated on the menu, so I was pleasantly surprised to have a side salad substitute included in the cost of the meal.  Greek salad was pretty fresh by pub standards.

Sticky toffee pudding -- why, why, why?!!!  Why did you ruin it?  Again, this was a long-awaited birthday craving.  Sticky toffee is known for being caramel smothered sticky goodness.  So, why did the server smother the top with chocolate and strawberry sauce?!  GROSS.  I didn't want it to taste like a banana split.  Guess the server didn't really understand the point of sticky toffee is to be a caramel delivery system.  The cake was too dense for my liking and more dense than any other I'd had in the city; didn't mind it, but wasn't my fave.  What little caramel sauce I could taste by itself was yummy & had a house made taste.

My other half liked their style of chips (fries).  Skinny fries (not steak fries), though, not quite as skinny or crispy as McDonalds.  Some skin was still on the tips, which he prefers.

Several TVs with different types of sports going at once.

Some cigarette smoke does waft in since there are several sidewalk tables scrunched by the front doors.  So move to the back or the right of the restaurant if you're sensitive

I think it's a good place to unwind, I don't think it's the kind of place you'd take someone to impress them.  Good mix of people of various adult ages, but probably not the type of pub place where people tend to bring kids.  The Abbott & Duke of York might be more kid and family oriented, but I wouldn't be too worried if the kiddos tagged along."}
{"text":"I have been hear several times now and it is pretty good. Their take on Spring Rolls are interesting. Several beers on tap to choose from.

Not sure how condusive the layout is to a pub though. Multi smaller levels. We will see. If it were me I would take the next layer up and switch the seating to a better pub style and put in a really big screen.

Good place to go on a Sunday afternoon to watch the football game."}
{"text":"This place is so comfortable. the staff are great!!!!!!!!!!!! 

The food is good. not too too pricey. but worth it. the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.  Sunday nights they have live music. a lot of regulars and if your not one you might be soon enough. their trivia night gets pretty packed as well.
In the summer the patio is great, you can enjoy with friends or sit alone and people watch.

I think sundays are great, if your into Live, loud rock bands. it nice to have these places that are comfordable enough to just check things out,  be it alone or with friends."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends tonight to celebrate st Patrick's day ! We waited for an hour which was fine cuz it was super busy , after an hour we got a table ! The service was amazing ! Our waitress was super friendly and oh gosh the food was great too! We ordered the shepherd's pie , chicken pot pie and the Caesar salad ! They were all delicious ! We ordered the sticky toffee pudding it was ok but not the best one I've had ! Over all I'll give them 4.8 out of 5 ! I highly recommend  !!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and find everyone friendly and welcoming. Really nice servers. Food is about par, but I never expect much from bars. I have read a few of the reviews here, so maybe I am treated better because I go with my bf who is a regular."}
{"text":"I've been to this place on more than one occasion. Once was for New Year's Eve and every time it was a great place to be.  The live shows are usually good old rock and roll cover bands.  The food is alright, I wouldn't go there for dinner.  The cajun fries and the nachos are good to down with the beers.  They got the Kilkenny and the Guinness so it's all good.  Oddly enough one evening we went there instead of Philthy's also because they were asking for a cover... pathetic.  If I want to just sit and eat some food I'm not giving you 5 dollars to sit."}
{"text":"Wings are not that good and if you're having a special on wings, 1lb + pitcher..10 wings as opposed to 7 would be more of a deal considering they charge $20! No deal here folks... atmosphere was a very UK bright lit pub, no music, very hum drum.. although it was a Sunday"}
{"text":"They have curry fries on the menu, which I am a big fan of. I like sitting on their front patio in the summer. The service was fast and friendly the few times I've been there. So it's generally a good place."}
{"text":"In terms of set up, they got this place right. They have a nice patio outside for evenings in the summer (not great for the day though because it is shady) and a mix of high top tables and bench seating inside.

They must do live music regularly because every time I've been there it's been playing. The bands have been good too. 

I'm going to sound like an old foggy for saying this but the music is way too LOUD. I can barely carry on a conversation with the person sitting right next to me in this pub. 

I also happen to know it's a good crowd on St. Patrick's Day.

This is a pub I tend to avoid in the winter, and stop by occasionally in the summer to have a beer on their patio."}
{"text":"Nice to still have throwback places like this in Toronto.  Live, loud rock music (on a Sunday anyway) that everyone was pretty into (lots of regulars around) and tv's in the background with sports playing."}
{"text":"our friend's band performed here on St Patty's- they were great. 
The bar is your typical Irish pub, esp on St Patty's Day- loud, drunk, sloppy...and i can't believe they charged us $10 cover. eeeeks. 
other than that- typical"}
{"text":"Other than Anthony, who is a gentleman, the place is a shit hole. The Staff the last three times I have encountered are one word \"Contankerous! \"
The young, s mutt Blond Bartender was rude and condemnable.  Plus there was nothing Gluten free on their late night over menu. Too bad. The crowd seems odd too...but 3 strikes....your out in my Books!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy place for a bite to eat and some live music!

We came here with a large group on a Friday night. The servers were really friendly, proactive and very good about separate bills and what not. 

Around 9pm there was a live band that played from great tunes from the 70s 80s and 90s. Very much enjoyed singing along to 'The Way' - Fastball. There were a lot of one hit wonders in the 90s, hmm..

But although the music was great, it was LOUD. We spent the time shouting at each other. The place is smallish, so no need for such volume. 

I didn't have any food, but seemed like the usual pub fare. From my cohorts, seemed like the food was a solid 2. The pad thai (why would you order pad thai in a pub) looked terrible, even though they gave so many noodles, the flavours were only on top. They did enough the garlic, butter mushroom with bread - but very oily. 

There was a decent selection of drinks including half pints, great for me!"}
{"text":"One Saturday evening, I attended a friend's housewarming party, she lived on the 7th floor of an apartment building near Mount Pleasant and Eglinton, the tub was full, the place was packed, the party was lit. At 11:01pm, her landlord called her to tell her that she is disturbing her neighbours and we had to shut it down.

In an attempt to find the next closest watering hole, we moved the entire party here. When we came in around 11:45pm, it was still fairly empty, and there was live music going on, pretty cool place. The server came by to ask for drink orders in which I asked for a water that I never got. Thanks! As the night went on, I got chatting with some regulars and found that they'll be relocating hopefully soon as the current location will be used to build new condos or whatever. 

I hope they find a new home and carry their traditions of live music and fun times."}
{"text":"Came here for Monday trivia night and I can't wait to go back. Can't comment on the food as we just did drinks (which were reasonably priced), but other people's looked good for pub fare. It was such a fun night though! The trivia runs from 9 - 11 and the MC was hilarious and kept it running smoothly. It seemed like there was a lot of regulars, and who knows maybe I'll become one."}
{"text":"It seems Scruffy Murphy's isn't actually closed - it just moved a block down the street to 180 Eglinton Ave E in a building that once housed a Golden Griddle.

I stopped in for a lunch with adequate pub style results.

The menu is standard pub fare, and I went with the Scruffy Burger which is a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg on top for $13.99. It was a decent burger and the fries were okay too, no complaints.

The beer menu is standard macro brands with the Buds and Labatts of the world. Not impressive but they did have 2 craft beers on tap - Cameron's Ambear Ale and Captains Lager ringing in at a cool $5.50 (plus tax) per pint.

Service was kind of meh since the bartender was also serving tables, but I don't really have much to complain about so 3 stars seems right.
Here's hoping they put patio furniture outside as I walked by a few times in the summer and it always seemed weird to have a nice side street patio but not actually give people the chance to use it. I guess we'll find out next year?"}
{"text":"Chicken parm lunch special looks good.
Mill street Organic $6.. ok, I guess.. Maybe they have other $6 specials on other days? dunno.

older blonde seems cranky about the new girl.
she came out all crochety earlier and was talking to mgr-looking guy who seemed cool but I didn't talk to him..
Dude behind the bar was cool too.

--
Anyway, food was just ok, and I actually ended up there again in between writing this as a draft and posting as a review and the service really is terrible.  Plus, the server had absolutely no knowledge of the beers there.. For instance, we tried to order a Blue Moon, which they apparently don't have anymore but a Rickards Red was suggested in its place.. um.. no thanks."}
{"text":"Food poor, waitstaff preys on the drunk and takes advantage of their wallets, unless you're  a aggressive patron don't bother with this place.I bought a pint which was $6.25 gave her $8 and she goes \"thanks hon\" and walked off assuming that's the whole tip! No option. i usually give a buck on a pint.  Sad to say as its so local to me.   Firkin is way better! And just up the street from it."}
{"text":"So it's become something of a tradition for a friend and I to hit Scruffy Murphy's every few months and catch up over a plate of their glorious Mexican Fries. Our most recent trip, however, was so bad and so disappointing that I can't imagine we'll be returning any time soon.

We arrived on a Saturday night and the place was beginning to fill up. I ordered a pint and the aforementioned Mexican Fries. The pint arrived relatively quickly, and the fries soon followed.

The Mexican Fries, described in the menu as being topped with ground beef, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and cheese, used to come on a fairly big plate, which ingeniously ensured that every single fry was smothered in those toppings and the only \"naked\" fries were those around the edges. Honestly, it was perfect.

Sometime between my last visit and now, however, Scruffy's made the mind-bogglingly terrible decision to serve the fries in a shallow bowl. This ensures that there's a thin layer of toppings across the top but then a whole mess of \"naked\" fries near the bottom. I would guess that fries without toppings, in this new bowl, added up to more than half! This is completely unacceptable and what was once an absolutely scrumptious dish is now completely mediocre. The word \"meh\" was invented to describe this new iteration.

Adding insult to injury, I requested a second pint once the fries arrived and never got it. Out waitress disappeared to such an extent that I had to track her down and ask for the bill. I tipped her 15% but in retrospect even that was way too generous.

Ugh. What a frustrating night."}
{"text":"Found this one on a bar hopping. Awesome menu, bar and service. 

I asked many different shooters from their incredible menu, all of them were great. They have shooters, margaritas, martinis, you name it. I had even a Pomegranate martini! I could give all my money to a pub like this! 

Their problem, in my opinion, is the very loud live music. When a band is playing live, indoors, they have to be really careful so their loudness won't bother who is trying to keep a conversation. The band was good, but at a bad I'd like to talk and I had a VERY HARD TIME doing this.  So please help my night become better and adjust your volume. 

Despite the OMG LOUD MUSIC, the bar is good and I'd come back."}
{"text":"Scruffys is back!!!! Just down the street on Eglinton and redpath. It's smaller yes but it has a good atmosphere. The band is playing and the pints are flowing. #mynewoldwaterhole"}
{"text":"Good food, great service, no cover charge (really Philthy's what is wrong with you?!). The music isn't too loud, the dining area isn't too dark, the menus are clean of any leftover food remnants. Really, everything I like in an Irish Pub. I would go again, but I didn't find anything outstanding."}
{"text":"I had a couple of enrolment seminars to conduct today in the Yonge/Eglinton E area.  I was hungry after the second one so had a late lunch at Scruffy Murphy's which was nearby.

I like pubs.  Alas, since it was midday and I was driving, I had a Diet Coke rather than a draft.

It's a cute pub and there were a few people scattered about.

I was torn between the Homemade Butter Chicken or Scruffy's Meatlovers Pizza (bacon, hot Italian sausage, ground beef, cheddar, mozzarella and tomato sauce).  My server suggested the pizza.  I love love love pizza so pizza it was.

It was okay.  It was really chunky with meat and there was lots of cheese ... so no complaints about the amount of condiments.  The crust wasn't so great, though.  The texture reminded me of a frozen pizza.

When I'm in that area again, I'll stop in for a beer a meal."}
{"text":"When I visited Scruffy Murphys Irish Pub, I expected their menu to be more \"Irish\". Don't get me wrong, the food is good here but with being an Irish girl, living in Toronto, I was hoping for something a little more homely than pizza and jalapeño popcorn shrimp. 

I found the staff to be a little on the rude side. There was a group of us and he seemed a little bored when he was taking our order, which annoyed me. There were no smiles, no banter. 

When we were paying, I wanted to pay by card and the barman rolled his eyes at me. 

Needless to say, I never went back."}
{"text":"Cute Irish pub with a good menu selection. Good place to relax and have a pint however and it can get quite loud at times. Wouldn't go out of my way to make a visit but if you're in the area stop in !"}
{"text":"Had the Fettuccine Alfredo with a pint of Canadian... Service was lacking - waited long periods for server to show up to take order, bring the bill. Pasta was great comfort food, although the chicken was a tad dry - my guess is microwaved. Atmosphere was somewhat dull likely because of the construction out front blocking the view of the pub - not a lot of traffic through this place...

Despite the gaps of time we had to wait for service the server was very polite and friendly.

All in all I would come back to this place if a friend wanted me to. I wouldn't say no to coming here but I'm not sure I would take a detour to visit this place myself. If I did come back I would definitely try something I haven't had yet on the menu."}
