{"text":"Every time we are in Calgary from Edmonton we make a point of dining here. The staff have always been very friendly and the food is mm mm good!! And the pitcher of lime margaritas is delicious and shaken, not the slushy type. We always get the chips, fresh salsa, fresh guacamole and pickled pepper mix and we usually order seconds. Our favorite dish is a toss between enchiladas and carne asada.  Now compared to mexican food in the US, I agree that's its not the same but it's pretty darn good for being in the Canadian prairies!!"}
{"text":"Ate here while visiting Calgary, service was great, food was great as well!"}
{"text":"Started with a ceviche which appreared in the form of two patties of minced redish fish (which I was told was made of a whitefish). It was adequately done but lacked the citrus zing I was expecting. The fish seemed fresh but we are landlocked after all in Calgary, so I can't fault them too much here. The spice tended to overshadow all the other flavours but overall it was okay. The little tortilla chips it was served with were obviously homemade but were both on the thick and hard side as well as perhaps slightly stale. It shouldn't be too hard to make fresh tortilla chips regularly through the day and I was here for a late lunch, so this was underwhelming to say the least.  the service was merely okay on the day I went -- only a few people there so I thought it could have been a bit better.  The staff seemed intent on reading the paper.  overall the restaurant was alright.  Not great but not the worst either.  I went to S&P's other restaurant in Cochrane (now closed -- for good reason) and it was really pretty bad.  there aren't too many good choices for Mexican (tex-mex) here in Calgary -- if you have to have a fix, Salt and Pepper will do. But for the real deal go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I would like to point out that I do NOT eat a lot of Mexican food (my stomach just doesn't handle it that well normally). But, this place was alright.  My friend brought me here with another one of his close friends and her toddler. The atmosphere was noisy, and busy, but its more like that of a huge family dinner, rather than that of a busy restaurant. Personally, didn't bother me that much.  The girl who seated us seemed a little nervous, frazzled and jumpy. Possibly on a caffeine high, but I'm not really one to judge. Either way, she was polite, and efficient at what she did. In the end, we had four servers help us, which threw me off a bit, but they pulled it off quite well. Not often you see teamwork in an environment like this.  I had a Pina Colada to drink. I think they may have added the alcohol after, cause that first sip was super strong. After a quick stir though, it sweetened out and tasted how it should have.  We had calamari and some sort of chip+dip for starters. The calamari was a bit lackluster, but aside from that, no complaints.  I honestly don't remember the name of what I had (some of those menu items are a touch difficult to pronounce =P). It was some sort of layered chip nacho type dish. The chips had become a wee bit soggy during the cooking process, but it tasted pretty good. It was served with beans and rice (both decent). None of us went for dessert, as we had our fill of food by then.  The pricing was a bit high for what it was (as other reviewers have mentioned). Only three full meals were ordered and two appetizers, plus one alcohol beverage, and it came to about $85.   I personally would eat here again, but it will be only once every few months I think. As I said, Mexican food rarely does well with me, but this place wasn't bad, and I didn't get any food poisoning. But the food is a bit heavy, and sits with you for a while afterwards.  As always though, try it sometime, and draw your own conclusions =)  Live well, rest well, be well."}
{"text":"Salt & Pepper Mexican Restaurante    Category: Mexican 4.0 star rating 1/23/2011 Salt & Pepper Mexican Restaurante a taste of Mexico in the village of Bowness.

The food magnifico OLE !  My Gluten Free suggestion is the Mexican Corn Tortilla Lasagna.  Escape to the border ....in Calgary Arriva Arriva"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on friend's birthday, I liked the environment and the design of the restaurant, we ordered chicken quesadilla and it was one of the best! Service was also pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice staff, but the service can be slow on a busy evening.  Comfortable decor and great drinks.  I love the fresh salsa and chips.  I personally love the mole sauce on their enchiladas."}
{"text":"I like this place. Its pretty pricey for what you get but its not too bad. I like their mole sauce and the servers are 90% of the time really nice. Not great for a cheap date but pretty good for like an anniversary or something."}
{"text":"I used to live in Texas, so I've had REALLY GOOD mexican before and since moving back to Calgary I've been disappointed in every mexican place I've tried. I've been to the Salt & Pepper on Macleod and wasn't very impressed.... however I have heard the S&P in Bowness is the good one.... and it so is!! THIS is the best Mexican I've had since I moved back. First off.... Pinapple margaritas are soooo good that they could be very dangerous lol. The waiter we had was great, he laughed with us and was very personable... I found that all the staff was actually. I had the chicken fajitas and was very happy with my choice. The chicken was cooked just right and in this nice sauce that had only a tiny kick to it so it wasn't too over whelming. I've read that some people found the food there to be bland but that wasn't the case for us at all. We'll definitely be back here!! Now I know where the good Mexican in Calgary is, I'll want to go all the time. I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD!! The ONLY weird thing was you didn't get any chips and salsa when you walked in. I've NEVER been to a Mexican restaurant and not been served chips and salsa when you sat down. But we were so stuffed by the time we left, I think it might have been good we didn't have chips first."}
{"text":"One thing comes to mind when I think about Salt & Pepper, MARGARITAS!!  Their margaritas are the best I have ever had!  A huge plus is on Monday's when they have margarita jugs on for $10.99!!  They have the traditional lime, strawberry and pineapple, all are so yummy!  The restaurant itself is well decorated in the Mexican theme, nicely dimmed in the evening.  The place is roomy enough but can get a bit noisy on a busy night, depending of course on the people there.  If you have to wait they have an area in the back with a couple seats.  When I came here with friends on a Friday night, they sent us back there to wait and seemed to forget about us, as we watched other people be seated that just came in.  So we continued to remind them and eventually we got a table, it was only about a 20 minute wait. The one down side to this place is the portions can be a bit stingy for what you pay, for instance you only get a small plate of nachos for $10.  The salsa con queso is my recommendation for an appetizer.  The entrees are quite reasonable in size, but when you are paying $13-16 for one entree you'd expect a bit more.  None the less the food is good!  The fajitas won't disappoint!  They do have all you can eat tacos on Tuesday, chicken is my choice, which are a bit unimpressive in size, but at least you can eat as many as you want!  This tends to be a good place to practice a bit of your Spanish too!  Uno mas margarita, por favor!!  I do recommend giving Salt & Pepper a try if you are looking for a nice dinner out, with friends or even just as a couple.  Above all I insist that you must go there for Margarita Monday, you will not be disappointed in their deliciousness!!"}
{"text":"Went one time with my aunt and no one was there so we had great service & on top of that the waitress was a real gentlemen. Our order came fast, the food was so good. We ordered an appetizer before our main meal and it was my favourite! It was so incredibly delicious. The appetizer we ordered is called \"Mexican chorizo\" it brings 2 soft tortillas, a bowl in the middle of the plate with different types of cheeses and chorizos with homemade tortilla chips. I would go again, no complaints."}
{"text":"I have learned to accept that Mexican food in Calgary sucks. This place used to have real, decent dishes (pork chops, fish, etc) but now the menu has no fish. Wow.  Prices are mid-line, which is stupid, because tex-mex food is CHEAP. Tortilla, produce, and meat. It really doesn't cost much, unless you're using Sysco or some crap. But no Mexicans live here, so they can just charge Calgarians inflated prices because they'll just pay anything for anything. They ding you a buck for a urine-cup-sized guacamole and sour cream. Oh, and no free chips and salsa. Nice touch.  They also don't have tostadas, hell, they didn't know what they were. uuuughhhhh.   I went here another time to get all-joo-can-eat-tacooos but all we could get was chicken or, get this, GROUND beef. WTF. The server didn't even know what \"carne asada\" was, and she wrung her nose in disgust, thinking I was some freak contestant from fear factor when I asked if they had cow tounge (try it next time, seriously).   In any American city, this place would get one star. Well, actually, we wouldn't be able to rate it because this place would not be in business. But actually, in all fairness, if this place existed in the USA, it would be much better because I know this place is capable of it, but instead they seem to choose to cater to the mediocrity of our lowest common denominator.   If cost and inspiration are of no concern, go for it. The food isn't THAT bad. If you're looking for something delicious and truly Mexican, you're in the wrong country.   Lame lame lame."}
{"text":"Tasty food. We were a little surprised at the price compared to other Mexican restaurants. Entree price averages ~$15+  but the food was good and a decent sized portion. Our complaint was the poor service. We got seated fairly quickly and got our appetizer quickly but that was it. It took almost 30 minutes to get our two entrees and the food was lukewarm by the time it was served. Yes it was Friday night and busy but we noticed other tables around us were getting their food quicker so I suspect our waitress forgot. Also, it took a while to get a second round of mojitos and water refills, which was quite unfortunate after taking a bite into hot sauce. It took even longer to get the bill. Bottom line: tasty food but poor service."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, but the pure rudeness of the waiter did it for me. Ignored our order, barely attend to us, then threw our change at us. Horrible"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has fallen far.  Poor quality, overpriced, small portions.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Wow that was some tasteless and overpriced Mexican.  I had the chorizo burrito and it was bland, soggy and all together awful.  Also - how do you take the taste and flavour out of rice and beans?   I also had a 2oz Monday special margarita that had zero booze in it.   I know the Mexican food scene is slightly challenged in Calgary but this was so bad I would recommend Taco bell instead."}
{"text":"Although Calgary is often referred to as the \"Houston of Canada\" there are many things that we don't have in common with our southern brotherly city - including an abundance of Mexicans. This naturally results in a lack of cheap, authentic, quality Mexican food. However, this is undeniably one of the better places in Calgary to grab some Mexican grub.   Be prepared to wait a while if you head down during peak dinner hours and don't expect your server to spend much quality time with your table. However, you CAN expect the following:   Delicious salsa fresca.  Yummy carne asada.  Great appetizer selection - especially the champiñon con chorizo and queso.  PINEAPPLE MARGARITAS (on Mondays, especially).  An airy and lively atmosphere.  Great weekly specials.   It's busy, it's fun and you'll leave feeling satisfied. Prices are a little high, but every time I visit I leave feeling it was worth it."}
{"text":"Found this cute little restaurant by accident. Walking in makes you feel like you're in Mexico. The seating seems limited but they were handling the supper crowd without any waiting so must be more tables than it appears to have. The food was good and the server was great. Even charged my phone for me while we ate. The only real downside to this restaurant were the drinks. The tequila sunrise tasted like kool aid at first, then the slightly over poured tequila hit. So, food is good but drinks are at your own risk."}
{"text":"The patio is so cute, very authentic....it definitely gets points for ambiance.  Tonight they had live music on the patio to top it off.  A guitar player, playing Spanish music, was very lovely.  We were given a complimentary appetizer when we arrived, a basket of chips with homemade salsa, guacamole & hot pickled vegetables...so good!  My lime margarita & beef tacos were really tasty.  We were dining with our 5 yr old daughter who is a pretty picky eater.  She really enjoyed her quesadilla & Spanish rice and virgin margarita....$5 for kids meals, great deal!   It definitely exceeded my expectations & we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service is shockingly bad. We ordered our starters and a main. They forgot the starter and brought us out the mains. We had barely finished our meal when the server came over to ask us if she could bring us the bill. We said we'd like to see a dessert menu and she told us the kitchen was closed. This was just after nine and their website says they are open until 10. There were two other tables there that were eating so it wasn't like we were the only ones. So we said give us a couple minutes as we all had full drinks and wanted to sit and talk. She came back 10 minutes later with a debit machine and the bill, and asked us if we'd like to pay cash or credit. I guess she was in a rush to get us out of there. On top of it, they charged us for the starter that we didn't get. I can't remember ever having such rude service- don't go. The food is good but you'll leave with a bad taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Over priced and awful tasting, I should have had mcdonalds. Im shocked anyone would say the food is good here. But then Calgary is So lack-luster when it comes to mexican I shouldnt be surprised. Oh and the service was beyond lousy, she deserved a penny-tip"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on a Saturday evening, around dinner time. It wasn't over-the-top busy, but we waited about 15 minutes for our table.  We ordered our drinks. The server went away for a few minutes, then returned to ask again what we had ordered.  We then ordered our food: chicken fajitas and fish tacos. We saw a table for seven come in. They were seated and served their drink orders. After about 20 minutes, we noticed that the table of seven were brought their food orders, while we were still waiting for ours. After another 5 minutes, our server returned and asked us what we had ordered. He claimed that the kitchen lost the order but wanted us to reorder, just so he could \"make sure\" it was right. We reordered: chicken fajitas and fish tacos. He apologized for the delay and mixup. He said, \"We'll make sure we take care of you guys.\"  Our food arrived about 10 minutes later and was missing guacamole. We pointed this out and he said he would bring it to us. He stopped and chatted with the table of seven. A few minutes later, he brought out the guacamole.  The food was middling, at best. The flavours were quite bland. The refried beans seemed like a day-old serving.  After our meals, our server asked if we would be interested in dessert. We were not; we just did not have room. He said, \"Well, I tried.\" We didn't know what he meant by that. When he brought us the bill, no adjustment was made for the poor service, lost order, long wait for our food, etc. We realized that his dessert offering was his only feeble attempt to make good on the experience. \"We'll make sure we take care of you guys\" was a promise that was left decidedly unfulfilled.  We paid the bill, left no tip, and will not return."}
{"text":"Service is beyond slow. Too bad, food is pretty good. But not enough to outweigh service."}
{"text":"For what it is - Mexican food in Calgary, sure, 4 stars. Not much to complain about and I rate it equally to the one we tried in Inglewood last year. Some thought went into the decor here and I love the orange wall colour. The restaurant was clean and it was not too busy on a Monday night. Free parking out front - bonus. (2 hour limit until 6pm, then unlimited) Service was.. ok. The waiter did his job, no more, no less. Our water glasses were never refilled once but that could have been an oversight. The music was alright, I have heard better Latin music but did not really impact the evening one way or the other. My 2oz marg was on sale for the \"Margarita Mondays\" special. It was tasty but I felt it a bit weak - maybe I just had a hard day! These took a while to arrive to our table. I had a coupon for a free taquito appy - it was heavenly. We were so hungry, it was just devoured. The food came out quickly, the mains as well. I had my usual, the enchiladas and I had one of each meat filling. Very good, extremely filling. Hubby got the chicken burrito and it was yummy! A little extra sour cream on each plate would have amounted to perfection but as it was, neither of us could really move afterwards which made our going to a crowded Mall after, a bit much.  I would recommend if you have an appy, even a shared one, to also share a main, like the taco platter or the fajitas. The food is very good but very heavy. Be prepared to pay $16 - $22 a plate for a main dish. TIP - go onto the website and print off your free appy coupon before heading over, valid at Inglewood or Bowness locations. TIP 2 - the salsa verde on the table is delicious. The heat will sneak up on you though so use caution! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"EPIC! We've wanted to come here forever and never think about it. So Monday we decide let's check it out, I mean it's margarita Monday!   The owner/manager was phenomenal. He was funny, he was pleasant and made the experience that much more. I said I was gluten free, so he gave me his pick of GF appies. The chef actually came out and talked to us to make sure everything was good and tell me what was in the meals. Then I had chicken quesdilla for my meal, which was delish! Went great with our two pitchers of pineapple margaritas!   After the meal, he gave us this wonderful shot and eve drew me a picture on my take out container. I can't wait to go sit on the patio when it's warmer."}
{"text":"Sangria was good.   Food was exactly what we wanted. Split the taco platter to fill two people comfortably."}
{"text":"The food quality has gone downhill, while the prices are being jacked up.   Definitely not worth the cost - comparable quality of meal from Mucho Burrito for a quarter the price tag."}
{"text":"Great food at a good price. The server was a little slow to get to us, but after we ordered, we had a great meal. The patio is a great area to sit during the warm evenings, and they even had a fellow playing music."}
{"text":"This place blew my taste-buds away!!!  We came on a Friday night, and there was about a 30 minute wait. We had been craving Mexican food all week, so we decided to wait.   Service: Service was great. Our server was friendly, and knowledgeable. It was a really busy night, and she still managed to provide awesome service despite the amount of people that were there. The only struggle we had was with the delay of food. That of course was out of her hands, but trust me.... THE WAIT IS WORTH IT.  Food: YUM YUM YUM! The food is delicious. We started off with the chimichangas, and the chips and salsa. The chimichangas were tasty! Chips were made in house, and the salsa was so fresh!  I can't remember what my meal was, but let me tell you. I ate the whole plate. The whole thing. And the plates are pretty dang big! SO SO SO GOOD. I do remember wanting to customize my plate with Shrimp, and she was able to do so with no hesitation (even if it wasn't on the menu. My friend had something delicious too! I can't remember what he had either... YUM YUM YUM!  Drinks: We only stuck with beer, but they had Dos Equis! All I needed to know!  Atmosphere: They had pretty awesome decor! You felt like you were in an authentic mexican restaurant, not like Chipotle (although, I love me some Chipotle!)  I would most definitely go again! Have a craving for Mexican? This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner late April. The service was great and so was the food. Look forward to going back"}
{"text":"It was a blizzard when we decided to go out for supper with the family. My son craved Mexican food so we braved the drive down to Salt & Pepper in Bowness, and so glad we did. This sweet little restaurant is loaded with traditional flair. Warm and inviting. It was quite empty in there, because of the weather I am assuming. The service was great and super friendly. It felt like you were over at your family's for supper. They even gave us a free appetizer. The food was amazing. Just was the doctor ordered. We ate too much but it was worth every penny. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good quality Mexican food in Calgary!  I was told by others that is was a bit overpriced and they were correct.  The atmosphere matched the price, but the food was about 20% overpriced for what it was.  The sauces are very nice and the my food was cooked perfectly.  If you're familiar with Chevy's,  it was exactly like that.  Hence my thinking it was a tad overpriced.  My friend had a large pice of beef that seemed to have been overcooked.  I also. Had a Mojito and it was perfectly made."}
{"text":"Very expensive and I left still feeling hungry. Mucho burrito is half the price and twice as much food, and also tastes better."}
{"text":"Tastey food but a little salty for our tastes. We ordered the Chef's Platter for two, which was a lot of food! It was a great way to try a bunch of different things on your first visit, but three pork chops was a bit much!"}
{"text":"Love the patio here! - Pretty lights and totally covered by clear corrugated plastic panels, yet it's open air and feels cozy.  My family and I went for dinner last night because it was All You Can Eat Tacos night (Tuesdays). Of course after we ordered our free taquitos appetizer (coupon on website) and ate our order of chips and guacamole, my husband only managed to put away the first round of tacos! I was smarter and knew I couldn't eat that much so my daughter and I split the Combo platter which features a chile relleno (decent - mild pepper, good quality cheese, pretty good batter, lots of tomato sauce), a beef taco (meat was surprisingly very flavorful), and a chicken enchilada (tender flavorful chicken, lots of sauce), plus the obligatory beans and rice.  We were very full afterwards.   I also ordered a Pineapple margarita because of the solid reviews I read on Yelp, and it did not disappoint! I don't love tequila so I tend to avoid margaritas in favor of daiquiris, but this was the right amount of sweet and a good balance with the tequila."}
{"text":"Just had one of the worst service experiences of my life. (Second only to the crappy service I received at the Salt & Pepper Inglewood location a couple years ago.)  I called this morning and reserved a table of 6 for myself and my co-workers for a Christmas treat. (First demerit, phone etiquette. Would have been nice to hear \"Salt & Pepper Bowness, how can I help you?\" rather than \"Yeah?\")   We reserved a table for after the lunch rush - at 1:15pm. When we arrived they had no record of our reservation and told us we needed to wait for a table. We waited for just under 10 minutes and were somewhat confused because there were only two deuces occupied in the entire restaurant - and two servers working.)  It took about 10 minutes to get water, and then another 10 for our server (an overly tanned, bald man) to come and take our order. With the two deuces finishing up and leaving, I'm not sure what the hold up was. The order process was painfully slow and it was obvious our waiter wasn't paying any attention at all to what was being ordered. He got confused when one of us ordered a pepsi and another ordered and iced tea - that had to be repeated several times so he could write it down. 4 out of the 6 of us ordered tacos - this wasn't a complicated order. It was bizarre. When he left the table we honestly wondered if he had been drinking or on some kind of drug, he was so vacant and inattentive.  After taking our orders he and the other server working got into a yelling match about 10 feet away from us - just over by the bar - completely inappropriate.   3 of my co-workers and I had gotten a pitcher of margaritas - instead of asking us how many glasses we needed when we ordered, he threw a little spaz when he brought the pitcher to the table because he didn't know who was having the margaritas. He never brought the iced tea or pepsi we had spent so much time ordering. And when I asked him to bring them during the meal, he looked straight at me, and walked away with saying a word. Or bringing the drinks.  We got our food - which was today's only saving grace. I love the food at Salt & Pepper, but their service has always been mediocre at best. Especially so today. Our waiter wouldn't give of one our group his meal unless he pronounced it correctly - he just stood there dangling the plate over the table. I honestly thought he was just going to drop it on the table.  He came to check on us and started complaining about the music because he doesn't know Spanish. We were trying to eat and enjoy our meal, we didn't really need a diatribe on not understanding the music that's being played.   While we had been eating, the two deuces left, and another came in. We were all finished eating and had been sitting at the table for about ten minutes trying to get his attention to clear our food and get us our bill (this was to be a quick lunch out, we didn't have a lot of time - that's why I had called ahead, and why I booked after the lunch rush) but instead he stood there with the debit machine in his hand with the two other patrons yacking about how busy it was and how he was the only one working, and how he didn't expect so many people to be coming in today. All the while not taking their payment or moving the process along in any way, shape or form. We watched this for about another 10 minutes and I was honestly ready to grab the spare debit machine from the bar and a menu and put through our payments ourselves. Instead I approached him at the two-top and mentioned that this was a work lunch and we really had to get going - could he please bring our bill and the debit machine as soon as possible? He just stared at me. Again. Didn't say a word. Totally bizarre.   He FINALLY came to our table with the bill and we pointed out that we were being charged for the Pepsi and the Iced Tea that he never served us, and his response was \"Oh yeah! That's why those two drinks were sitting on the bar!\" We hadn't asked for separate checks because again, our orders were so simple that we could do the math ourselves, and there's no way to split a pitcher of margaritas, so no problem, we just need to use the debit machine separately. (Plus it might have taken our waiter another hour to figure it out.) But after asking him several times for the debit machine because that's how we all were paying, he was totally stunned when we each gave him our total and our cards. He just stared for a minute again. (\"This will take me to the end of shift to ring in!\") And then he informed us that instead of tipping him we could shovel the walk in front of the restaurant. Yeah... sorry pal, there won't be a tip for you today.   Bottom line, great food, worst servers ever."}
{"text":"I used to love salt and pepper but haven't been in probably 6 or 7 years. From what I remembered it was awesome times, good service.. etc.  This time fell extremely short. We were greeted promptly around 6:30 last Friday night and seated at a table for 2 right beside the bar. We sat without water or a greeting for around 10 minutes. The hostess finally came over and gave us some water. The male server came by shortly after. He did not seem overwhelmed with the amount of tables in there (and rightfully so, it wasn't busy) but we ordered a pitcher of lime margarita and he went to prepare it. Being seated right by the bar, it still took extremely long before our drinks arrived - and we received pineapple instead of lime. We also ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. We waited and waited and the chips never arrived. We ordered entrees - beef enchiladas and beef tacos. The entrees arrived - Luke warm - still no appetizer. We assumed they weren't coming. The portion size was pathetic. The server never came to check on us, other staff cleared our plates and we sat with empty drinks for almost 10 minutes until he asked if we needed anything. We promptly got the bill - tipped accordingly, the service definitely left much to the imagination - and left disappointed and still hungry. Won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here with work colleagues on Monday during lunch and we had an excellent meal.  The chicken with tequila, stuffed poblano pepper, and enchilada were all excellent.  The mushrooms with chorizo and cheese were also a great appetizer.  Great service, too."}
{"text":"I'm from Arizona so I feel like I know a thing or two about Mexican food. That being said, I really like Salt & Pepper when I'm craving some tacos and beans! It's not the sloppy greasy Mexican style cuisine (which I happen to be a huge fan of) but rather a clean and simple menu that is very traditional in some parts of Mexico.   They have a coupon for some free taquitos on their website, which is a nice appetizer to start with. The service has been great the few times I've been there and I consider it one of the better Mexican food places I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for their All You Can Eat Taco Tuesday. Firstly I have to comment on our server. He was very abrupt with us during our time there. We had never been there for taco Tuesday and just wanted to know how it worked. He seemed impatient with our questions.  When serving our food, he would abruptly place our plates on the table, almost slamming them down.  At the end of our meal, he threw the bill with the standard chocolates they give after every meal on our table and walked away. When I say \"threw\" i mean he literally threw it on the table.  He was clearly very irritated and it was seething through in his service to us.  We are not a demanding bunch. We ordered politely, said our please and thank yous. We didn't have any special dietary restrictions to make any of our orders complicated...but he made us feel as if it was so troublesome to serve us.   Now onto the food itself. I tried their beef, chicken and chorizo...all of which were lack luster in flavor. Chicken was my least favorite, extremely dry. Chorizo was neither bad or good. The beef was the best of the 3 but even then, not much to it other than browned ground beef that I could taste. The meal was just ok. There are many other restaurants that serve Mexican fare at similar prices but the food is distinctive, flavorful and made with care. Had we gotten better service, I would have rated Salt and Pepper a 3 star, food is neither bad or good, and price is not cheap or expensive.   Would I return to this location or recommend to others? Probably not."}
