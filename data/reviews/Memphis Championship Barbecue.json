{"text":"Memphis BBQ is one of the good BBQ restaurants in Vegas, next to Famous Dave's and Lucille's.  The atmosphere is relaxed and casual, the staff is friendly and available, food is delish and prices are reasonable.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"You know it's bad we when the food gives you a headache. We used to go to this restaurant all the time. Something has changed. The food, whatever wasn't fat, all tasted old. Even the normally reliable warm buns had hard corners. The only redeeming quality remains the Apple Blossom iced tea. Service was fine, it's just the quality of food has gone down. And oh my god the bathrooms were disgusting! There were no towels to dry your hands and the  floor and stalls look like they hadn't been cleaned in quite some time. While it's possible this was a unique occurrence, we've never experienced anything from them like this before."}
{"text":"Good BBQ in Vegas but not as good as we're used to finding in the Midwest.  Liked the choices of sides and pork ribs were good (maybe we were too early in the day and they just hadn't been smoked enough?)."}
{"text":"I have eaten there in the past and it has been really good. I pulled through the drive thru tonight and when I arrived home with my food there was hair on the chicken fingers. I ended up throwing the whole meal away. It was actually fried on there and it was obviously hair. The fingers were supposed to be cooked in the spicy sauce and instead it was just put on the side in a container. Waste of money and food. I will never eat there again. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy. What kind of BBQ joint has a drive through window!! Has all the awards up so you can see, even the president (clinton)went there, or they took a picture with him. Everything was pretty good. Ribs, great, good flavor, pulled pork, great. Bisckets were hot and fresh. beer was good and they have a drink special each day. Service was nice. And they give you sauces so you can mix and match. i sort of like thicker sauces but this was good too, little more on the vinegar side though."}
{"text":"I've been here several times over the past few years, they even catered a party for me once.  The food has always been very good.  The brisket is always tender and I really enjoy all of their sides.  I like the vinegar based cole slaw instead of the mayo based slaw you find at some other places.  I don't think I've even been there without ordering the fried pickles, yum!  The pulled pork is sometimes a little dry, but I like their sauce so much that enough of that ends up on my food anyway.  The star deduction is for their sometimes spotty service.  Yesterday our server was great, other times it was, well, not so good."}
{"text":"I expected some great food here, why shouldn't I?? The place is called MEMPHIS CHAMPIONSHIP BBQ...  When you walk in there are  huge trophys everywhere you look with Shiny gold pigs on them.  Instead I got some very basic food here. The BBQ was the same as say Chilli's, Fridays or something..  There was no soul what so ever, Im sure they smoked this meat but hours earlier, the beef ribs and chicken were both luke warm (chicken almost cold) and lifeless. I cant help but wonder when my food was really cooked..    I ordered as my sides, Mac and Cheese and Fruit salad.  The mac and cheese was box variety, really!  The velveta box with the orange sauce pack.  Fruit salad was just a fruit cup. So im sure  NONE of this food was prepared for me, it was just put on a plate like a cafeteria.    Im sorry but this was a big chain restaurant eat and go lunch with little focus on quality, I would prefer Cracker Barrel to this any day.  At least it wasnt very expensive."}
{"text":"My first yelp review!!....so my friend and I just ate lunch here...really good! The pulled pork sandwich was very moist and they weren't stingy withvthe meat. The coleslaw on top really brought out the flavor in the pork....I mixed the sticky red sauce with the original sauce for a sweeter taste. I had the sweet potatoe and corn on the cob for sides both really good also. Did I mention that im fat...lol....I ended the meal with the apple crisp a la mode....it was ok. The service was great...had a southern type feel to the place...not too pricey for the amount of food you get.....overall really good....will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We just returned home, Indiana,from Vegas.  Four of us.  We ask \" What was the least favorite thing we did in Vegas.  We all said Memphis Barbecue.  I'm not sure who is writing some of these reviews, but, Do not waste your money here! Sauce was watered down, but I don't think I would have liked it anyway.  Cole slaw was spoiling, turning yellow, magic dust was great on the macaroni and cheese, onion rings were good. Very disappointing, especially after all of the awards they had received thirteen years.  Don't eat here!"}
{"text":"BBQ was really dry and the tea was pretty stale tasting. Only part of the meal I enjoyed was the buttered biscuits. Cheap though."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of 17th Street in Murphysboro I was hopeful for the same taste in Las Vegas.  I got the baby back ribs, which was my standard order back in Illinois, and they were close, but not as good as the original.  I would still call this the best BBQ in Las Vegas, but it could still be better.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as well, including the sides and various BBQ meats.  Overall I would recommend this place, it is just not quite as good as the original."}
{"text":"Meh.  I wasn't impressed with any of the food we ordered except for the ribs.    The beef brisket was decent, but it was served at damn near room temperature, and a tad on the dry side.  The sauce is really what made it taste good.  The vegetables were good, but they're vegetables.    The wings were definitely tasty, nothing special.  Again, it was the sauce they used that made them shine.  The ribs were AMAZING. Juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender.  You know what else made them good?  The Sauce.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy their sauces, but I don't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"If this is BBQ then give me bread and water.  Bland meats, turkey is dry as the desert outside. Red beans and rice is overly salty. The cucumber salad was decent though."}
{"text":"I just revisited this place and had a darn good lunch with very good service from Jamie.  I didn't go the bbq route for fear of being disappointed again, but the chicken fried steak here is VERY good (probably the best I've had in Vegas).  The yummy fried okra did not disappoint, and the cucumber salad was delightful--a lovely summery accompaniment to any meal.  The strawberry lemonade was delicious, too...a smidgen on the sweet side for me, but a squeezed-in lemon wedge did the trick beautifully to make it pretty close to perfect!  I was coveting a cop's luscious looking banana pudding served in a mason jar a few tables over, but, alas, the meal left no room for dessert...maybe next time!"}
{"text":"We are in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to visit Memphis Championship Barbecue. While the ratings for MCB were not stellar, they seemed OK enough to give it a try, especially since it was nearby our hotel. This was not a good choice.  Growing up in Alabama, I've eaten barbecue for most of my six decades. I know the difference in great smoked meats and southern sides. These items were not great.  Service was good. We were seated immediately and our server was at the table within a couple of minutes. I decided we'd order the Deviled Eggs appetizer. The server explained they were rather sweet because of Miracle Whip. She was right, but, they tasted OK. We did note that the plate was wet, usually indicating that the eggs were make a while earlier and stored in a cold refrigerator. Not old, but certainly not made when ordered.  Our server brought us some \"fresh rolls and honey butter\". The \"honey butter\" may have been made in-house, but the rolls were a food service bread that had been heated. We then placed our orders, one pulled pork plate and one two meat plate consisting of pulled pork & brisket. Sides ordered were collard greens, fresh corn on the cob, and red beans and rice. I'll address each item, starting with the sides.  Collard Greens- VERY overcooked (to the point of being almost black and mushy) and extremely sweet. The only flavoring was a heavy spiciness, not flavor, but heat. The only way to flavor them was with green pepper vinegar, but they were so overcooked we sent them back, choosing instead to have fried okra.   Fresh Corn on the Cob - The corn WAS fresh, but while the collards were very overcooked, the corn was nearly raw. So raw that it wasn't even warm all the way through. The husk end of the corn was still green, not white, as cooked corn is. When I explained to the server that the corn was not cooked she told me that they \"flash fried the corn\". I had to ask what she meant. Apparently they put the raw corn into a fryer basket and drop it into a deep fryer for \"1- 1 1/2 minutes because we don't want it to turn into popcorn\". The server apparently doesn't understand that popcorn is a specific strain of conn, which is dried. So, the cold/raw corn was returned. It was replaced with hush puppies. So now we've had two sides sent back.   Red Beans/Rice - Apparently canned red beans just heated up. No special spices. We kept them but they weren't good.  Fried Okra/Hush puppies - When okra arrived the breading was very uniform, so I asked if it was house made or frozen. Surprise...both the fried okra and the hushpuppies were frozen food service products. Now, as a southerner I am pretty appalled that a BBQ restaurant doesn't make hushpuppies from scratch. I mean, how hard is it to mix up a corn meal batter and drop it in a fryer?   Frankly, the best side was the frozen okra. It wasn't overcooked and was hot.   Sad...truly sad.  The meats, which should have been the star, just turned out to be a black hole of flavor.  While the pulled pork had a nice bark and smoke ring, it had absolutely no flavor. It was hot and not dry, but without a bbq sauce it was bland. The \"Original Sauce\" used on it was not much better. Only the \"Sticky Red Sauce\" had any flavor.  The brisket was tender, but aside from it's smoke ring there was no flavor there either.   They advertise their \"Magic Dust\", a seasoning that is apparently sprinkled on everything. Unfortunately, they should have rubbed it into all the meats prior to smoking.  But, the kicker was the piece of \"baked\" plastic found in my pulled pork. While I wanted to not believe everything was reheated that made me rethink it all.   So, the whole meal was extremely disappointing. Fortunately our server, who'd said she'd \"been doing this a long time\" was helpful and apologetic. She came back to our table to tell us the entire meal had been comped. While we did not eat but about 25% of the entire meal, we did not expect that to happen. As everyone should, we tipped her for the total of the whole meal.  My suggestion for the restaurant is to start flavoring the meat, make FRESH well-cooked sides, and dump the frozen & food-service prepped items."}
{"text":"Heard this place won a bunch of awards, so we had to try it the next time we were in Vegas. Went for lunch and had the ribs. They were good, but we have had better elsewhere. Several side dishes to choose from. The potato salad, beans and rice, and mac and cheese are very good. Pass on the fries. Typical BBQ joint selections: brisket, pulled pork, burnt ends, chicken, ribs."}
{"text":"Been eating at Memphis BBQ since I moved to the Valley in the early 90's. Certainly has changed a lot since then. Not always for the better. Still love it though. I miss the original beef ribs, but vendor changes can't be helped. The original location on Craig and LVB seems to be better, but this location does pretty good. The influx of other BBQ options in the Valley has definitely damaged the business as opposed to forcing them to improve. The food is the most important and it still stands the test of time. The only issues I have are it's inconsistenty as far as quality. Some days the meat is dryer then others, based on what time you come in. Some of the sides have changed as well and their quality hasn't always improved. After probably 150 times coming here, I've never had a terrible meal. Sometimes it hasn't been good, but never terrible. The revolving door of staff doesn't help the overall experience either. Maybe I'm just nostalgic and I feel a sense of loyalty to this establishment, but I seriously do like their BBQ. I've eaten at other places all over the valley and in other states, so I do have a gauge on other BBQ. Some are better, most worse. This is a local business that's been providing great food to Las Vegas for a lot of years. And as long as they're still around, I'll continue to patronize this establishment. I suggest you make the choice yourself and don't let a bunch of cry babies who don't eat red meat make the choice for you."}
{"text":"Very disappointed ! the baby back ribs were so dry they were rock hard and they did not include any dipping sauce with the onion straws when I called to complain I got the same old excuse everybody gives , \"oh the new employees must've made a mistake \" don't think I'll be going back there anymore ."}
{"text":"Consistently good food day or night for at least the decade that I've been a customer. Could not ask for more, thank you!"}
{"text":"I am visiting my mom in Las Vegas and I wanted some ribs,leaving the mall driving down warm springs we happen to see Memphis ribs and decided to eat there. The baby back ribs and burnt ends were very good ! We will Never go there again ! because while we were trying to enjoy our dinner the roaches were trying to enjoy it to. A roach ran across our table twice ! The waitress saw it also, we told the manager but he seem not concern and we still had to pay the bill ! So when you sit at a table there the roaches are trying to eat with you !"}
{"text":"Celebrated a familys birthday with 15 adults plus 4 Lil ones. We sat in the party room. Our server was great. He took care of our whole table by himself!!! The food came out hot and very tasty. We bought gift cards for stocking suffers for Christmas. So see you soon Memphis BBQ. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Three of us shared \"The Grand Champion \" combo plate, so much food and fast service! Loved it!"}
{"text":"What happened you guys?  Did you just give up? Par boiled, luke warm, scanty ribs don't cut it.  The sauce and seasoning that sits on the table is stale and old.  The kids portion is cold and over priced.  The pulled pork sandwich is tasteless and almost cold.  They still have the prices from ten years ago.  The wait staff act like they don't have the time and have given up.  Now is this anyway to treat a restaurant that is right next to our great Military base?  You guys could make this place a legend again and pack those seats if the food and service were back to the standard the long time locals remember.  There used to be the smell of slow smoked pork and beef int he air and people would flock to that location.  Now the parking lot is mostly vacant and no BBQ smell to be found.  Guys you lost it.  Either you skimped on the ingredients or you have cooks who don't give a flip.  Management could have changed.  But this place needs to go back to the good days when the food was to die for and there was a line out the door."}
{"text":"Mmmmm! Fried pickles and Burnt Ends! These guys definitely hold up to the title of being a champion!"}
{"text":"I waited a month to eat some BBQ (just needed to find a reason to go) and I finally got to go and satisfy my cravings. I was so pumped to get some ribs and brisket. Hell, I was ready to try some wings, Memphis style.  Disappointment all around with the food. The wings came in eights and I had two because they were not good at all. The ribs were pretty flavorless and I tried both. The brisket was not that bad, but a little dry. The baked beans were pretty good, but the steamed veggies were terrible.  The one thing I really enjoyed was the service throughout. The food was very Meh."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Las Vegas. Born and raised in TN, I know authentic Memphis BBQ. This is as good as it gets. Even though I've never been a huge BBQ fan, I enjoy the entire menu here. From the loaded potatoes, to the pulled pork, to the Southern fried Catfish, to the fried Okra....all prestine! Service is always great and since its a large place we rarely have to wait. Also, the complementary rolls with sweetened butter spread are to die for! I've ate at all locations in Vegas...and the quality is the same greatness at each one! Mos def a 5 star rating in my book. Good comfort food for me!"}
{"text":"Just ate dinner for Moms day.  Service was ok. Food not good at all tasted like it had been in the freezer too long. The sauce sucked too. Even the rolls are bad. Baby back ribs were tough and burnt as well. Green beans and coleslaw were edible"}
{"text":"I diet most of the week and let go once in a while.  I decided to let portion control go when I stopped here for lunch and ordered the combo BBQ.   Can't find any dry rubbed ribs like MC's in California.  The pulled porked was surprisingly delicious and the highlight of the combo plate when I least expected it.  I think I will make a visit to MC every time I visit Vegas.  This location is away form the Strip and I hope it's not a location thing."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and it was great. This time the ribs were overcooked, the chicken was small, the pulled pork was dry. The vegies were good. The tea was good. I had my kids and grandkids there and no one really like there dinner. I don't think I will be going back there anytime soon. The service was OK."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch as we were rolling through to Disneyland.  Good food, nice staff, and very fast!!  This would be a great place to go for lunch in a hurry, or to stop in at for dinner as well.  The bbq is not over sauced and the spice rub was spot on.  Of course if you like it saucey you can always put more on tableside."}
{"text":"Food was excellent...service was ok. Deep fried pickles....yummy."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying....I used to be a big fan of this place. I would bring visiting friends there, recommend it to my clients from out of town as a must visit and eat, but that was years ago. When service was top notch, the portions were plentiful, and the food was great.  Now, when I receive a plate here (pulled port sandwich), I wonder what happened?  My food was absolutely tasteless, and the sweet side potato which I paid $4 (price+tax+tip)....or should I say \"my half a sweet potato\" was clearly cut in half to add to the bottom line. It's a far cry from when they served decent portions of tasty food. It makes me wonder what other short cuts they have considered. I didn't realize there was a national shortage of sweet potato and a well dressed, cooked potato could cost me over $8 American dollars.  When I asked the Manager about the portion size, he simply stated \"that's how we do it\".  Thank you, but no thanks!"}
{"text":"Good food and an outstanding Apple Ice-T. Really good lunch specials two Meats for 999. Try their creamed corn won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Do not eat here! ! Went on a Sunday evening and ordered what was supposed to be dinner. Vegetables were microwaved and old, brisket I couldn't even eat, too vinergery tasting and old  Baked potato seemed like yesterday's food  Waitress didn't ask or refill ice tea not once.Old smelling and claustrophobic feeling.We have eaten at Memphis on Warm Springs and loved it! ! This location on Las Vegas Blvd needs to be leveled! !!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the BBQ restaurant anywhere. Period. Yes it's that good! I have been there twice in a day, I have been there 4 times in 3 days. I'm telling you this is good barbecue. After that 4 day stint, I had some great catfish... virtually every thing (save one) is really good, and the ribs are \"to die for\". This place should be on your bucket list. If you are in Las Vegas it is a sin not to have at least one meal here. If you live here, you should know. If you don't know you owe it to yourself to go find out. Memphis Championship barbecue is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for ribs so ordered a 1/3 rack of St. Louis style with sides of cucumber and potato salad to go. I got the end piece. The ribs seemed a little small, more like baby backs and were so dry that I couldn't eat the large piece at the end. If I had eaten in-house, I would have sent them back. The cucumber salad, however, was very good, vinegary and a little sweet at the same time. The potato salad was ok. Was looking for a good BBQ place like Williamson bros in Atlanta, but unfortunately, don't think I found it here. If I do go back it won't be for takeout."}
{"text":"This is the second time that I have been to Memphis Championship BBQ. I went with a friend for the lunch special.   I forgot who my server was, (we had two because we got there just before shift change). I do remember the bar tender. Her name was Carrie, we ordered the Irish Coffee with Jameson's Irish Whiskey, unfortunately they were out Jameson's, actually fortunately because we had coffee with a side of Knob Creek Bourbon. Carrie could not have been more of a delight, she wanted to make sure everything was to our liking. This is the first time I have had Knob Creek, it is a smooth sweet bourbon, with just a bit of a whiskey burn, I typically do not care for sweet whiskeys; however, this is one that is a fine exception to that rule.  We both had the Two Meat Lunch special with St. Louis Ribs and Brisket. The ribs were meaty and did not have very much fat on the pork ribs. There were three different BBQ sauces, the Original Memphis, the Spicy BBQ sauce, and the Sweet Red Sauce. I tried them all, I liked the sweet Red Sauce the best. The brisket was very good, it was not as tender as I would like it (my own brisket is more tender), and you could taste the rub that was used, this added to the flavor.   The waiter we had came back at regular intervals to make sure everything was ok. We had a few refills of coffee while we talked.   I would give the restaurant a 5 star rating except that the hostess did not let the waitress know we were seated, which caused a delay in getting our drink orders. And as I mentioned the brisket was not as tender as I would expect.   Overall I like the decor, there are a lot of trophies for their barbecue. They have some different accouterments around the restaurant that give it a comfortable feeling. Yes I will be returning, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone except the die hard barbecue aficionados."}
{"text":"The food was good but tasted a little too \"chain-y.\" I ordered the 2 item combo with St Louis ribs and burnt ends with sides of collard greens and mashed potatoes. The meat was OK, but again, tasted like food from a chain restaurant. The burnt ends were pretty tasty...loved the juicy fatty pieces. There were some pieces that were too burnt but the flavor was good.  The ribs were very trimmed for St Louis style. I like the big fatty tip of the SL rib which was missing from mine.  The meat fell off the bone and was very pink and had good smoke flavor. I liked the sweet and sticky bbq sauce that was on the table along their regular sauce, which was better on the ribs. The collard greens weren't too salty, but were too \"something.\" Maybe from a can? Mashed potatoes with gravy was a little plain. I couldn't tell if they were instant, which may be a good thing.  I actually rate it 2.5 overall. I would probably go again, but there is better bbq out there."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  This is just a continuation of my previous review.  I had a due-out from it, so please read it as well for a total picture.  Since this was a separate visit as well, let's talk about it in brief.  A burger is something I would expect any self-respecting BBQ place to do well.  Granted, to make one, it requires grilling, and not BBQing.  I guess this establishment just considers it beneath them to care about something as benign as a burger.  It's hard to excel at a burger, but it's also hard to mess one up.  Well, let me tell you of a few ways to lead down the wrong path as demonstrated here.  First, don't ask me how I want the burger done.  Typically if a burger is cooked beyond medium, it's because they're using an inferior meat.  Secondly, burger preparation is supposed to be minimalist, but not lacking entirely.  A waft of seasoning is all that's required, but I guess that doesn't work if all the burgers are the same preformed base for each menu version.  Thirdly, don't cook the heck out of a burger.  Luckily it wasn't fast food bad, but it was definitely poor workmanship.  Definitely not worth the price.  The hushpuppies didn't strike me as fresh, and they didn't have any semblance of being hand-made.  Yet, they did provide a medium in which to test their sauces, which I forgot to do on my first visit.  Their Original is far from its name-sake as it can it.  It takes just about like ever other BBQ sauce I've had (keep in mind I'm not a fan of any though).  The Red Sticky just seems like their Original mixed with some ketchup and maybe more (brown) sugar.  I honestly can't say if it made it better or worse.  Lastly, my \"favorite\" of the three would be their Spicy.  I wouldn't call it Spicy as in picante, but Spicy as in at least they put some spices in to give it flavor.  I guess I should have ordered some of their slaw to remind me why I risked another visit in the first place.."}
{"text":"Let me say first that this USED to be my favorite restaurant in town.  I referred everyone I know to eat here.  That was a couple years ago. I don't know what's happened lately but it's gotten bad. About six months ago I was served ribs that were microwaved, yes microwaved with that familiar super tough dry consistency and discoloration in the bones that only a microwave does.  I sent the food back and didn't eat.  A couple months ago I am craving Mike Mill's BBQ because of the memory of how it used to be so I gave it another chance.  Again ordered ribs and brisket. Brisket was cold and tasted like a 2 day old left over roast from the fridge, tough and dry.  My ribs tasted off.  The meat had the smoke ring as it should but under that was disgusting. The meat was a weird grey color. These ribs were cooked from rotten meat and if that wasn't bad enough they were microwaved gain.  I sent this meal back as well.  My wife sent hers back as well. Even the sides were bad.  The hush puppies were super dark almost looked burnt but were raw dough in the center. The server refunded our meal and said don't give up on them yet. I could hear someone getting yelled at in the kitchen when we sent our food back that they cost him a customer.  I really didn't want to give up on them. I gave them one last shot last weekend. Mike Mill's was in town for the Best Damm BBQ cook off in Boulder City so I thought it would be better with him around.  We went in Friday afternoon and me and my wife ordered baby back ribs. This time they send us cold meat that was weird again. Yes the meat was ROTTEN AGAIN! Disgusting again. I know what bad meat looks like, and this was bad.  That was strike three. From someone who came  here every birthday, several Thanksgivings and other special occasions, I give up.  Its apparent that there is no longer quality control and the management is grossly incompetent. PLEASE MIKE MILLS FIX IT!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, and always order the Pulled Pork Sandwich, sauce on the side.  I like mine dry so I can put what little sauce I want on it, as the pork by itself is some of the best I've ever had, and I don't like to drown out the flavor with BBQ sauce.    Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place! Great for groups! Service is always amazing. Thank you Pat for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"I remember this place being a lot better.  We live so close, and hadn't been in a few years so we decided to eat here.  Bad idea.  The service needs some improvement and the food was dry and tasted old.  Our food was lacking in flavor.  The one part I liked was the mason jars for drinking out of, that part was fun.  I don't recommend."}
{"text":"I love BBQ's, so if it seems harsh too bad, I am demanding.  Service is fine. Food is sub-par, typical BBQ fair nothing great or exciting.  Def not one of my fave fives."}
{"text":"First time eating there. Service was excellent, food was good but nothing to rave about. Ordered Baby Back Ribs, but they seemed to be regular ribs when brought out, even with extra sauce they were a little dry. To many other places to try so it'll be awhile before I return."}
{"text":"Below average BBQ. These people really need to step up their BBQ game. Our Women and Men of the Armed Forces deserve better! Meat quality was fatty. I ordered the Beef Brisket sandwich. Meat was not good. For sides, I got the red beans and rice, along with fried okra. Red beans and rice tasted like Copenhagen Long Cut. Gross!  Fried okra was OK, but had no flavor. Also ordered fried pickles before my meal, and I was somewhat confused if it was fried pickles or fried zuccini. Do they make their own pickles here?  Also, the pickles had no flavor, were soggy, and must have been fried in old oil. The \"Magic Dust\" was not so good, and I was reluctant to try the BBQ Sauce and Texas Hot Sauce on my table, because the bottle had been refilled so many times, the wrapper was peeling off. Not sure I would return, except for the Southern Sweet Tea, which was on point!  Be prepared for sticker shock!  I ate on a Sunday afternoon, and my total was $18.89."}
{"text":"I wouldn't feed this to a homeless person!  The only thing half way decent was the pork shoulder/ pulled port and the roll!  The brisket, fried okra, cole slaw, fried pickles, deviled eggs, and even the sweet tea were the worst I've ever had.  If you want BBQ go to Dickies, at least their food tastes good.  No, I don't work for or endorse Dickies, the food tonight litterally made me sick and angry that I had to pay for it!  I have been all over the US and this was BY FAR THE WORST BBQ I'VE EVER HAD!!!  The word \"Championship\" needs removed from their name!!!!"}
{"text":"I had been looking for some good bbq brisket. I had the brisket, collard greens and red beans and rice, with unsweetened apple blossom tea. The meal was good but the brisket was leaner than I am used to. I like the fat that is on one side, gives the meat a extra flavor. I could taste a slight smoke flavor but seasoning was kind of boring. They had some bottled seasoning called magic dust that added some flavor but I liked it better on the potatoe salad my fiance had than on the meat. Side portions were alittle small but the meat portion was ample. It came with a dinner roll and extra cornbread muffins were .49 cents. I would have liked if the muffins came with all the meals standard. or give an option for roll or muffin. All in all it was good but not great. Maybe next time I will try baby back ribs...It was just ok...not finger licking outstanding. We shareda  slice of pecan pie. It was good, sweet, we wanted warm and got a microwaved warm piece of pie. the center was cold, I will have to say the potato salad, tea (which comes in huge mason jars), and pie were my favorites. My fiance got the catfish, which was one big fillet, he said is good but I did not try. He loves the corn muffins and tea. On second thought, I may not go back for another visit and continue my quest to another joint."}
{"text":"Their ribs are tough and not very flavorful.  The pulled pork is so tough and greasy.  The brisket is so dry, like it's been sitting around for too long.  Their sides are ok, but is that really the point?  I do give them props for being a real barbecue place, that doesn't boil their meat.    The service is friendly and nice, though."}
{"text":"The only redeeming feature this \"barbecue\" joint had to offer, was exceptional customer service.   I spent nearly $60 on food that's all ended up in  the garbage. I got the 'GrandChamp' plate or whatever that cubed lunch box was called. The sauce was down right nasty. The overwhelming undertones between the meats,collard greens, & mashed potatoes became so relative & assertive. I tried adding a different sauce to it at home,but the damage had been done. Perhaps it may be impossible to escape the critique from a descendent of many,many butchers; but this location should really consider throwing out their supply of liquid smoke.

{"text":"Came for dinner waited 8 mon for anyone to come to the table.  Workers standing around talking. Looks like 1 server actually working. Food arrived mixed up order. Both the pork and beef ribs very dry. Sides of red rice was way salty. Mac and cheese tasted like craft boxed. I see why it's empty now.  Won't try again."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write because my server at Memphis Championship Barbecue (MCB) was just one of the nicest, sweetest people you'll ever have the privilege of meeting.  But she was in no way responsible for the quality (or rather, complete lack thereof) of the food.  For an appetizer, I tried the onion strings with \"magic dust.\"  The onion strings tasted like they were frozen food thrown into a deep fryer, and the magic dust tasted like, well, just dust.  Guilty confession here, I have been known, at times, to secretly enjoy frozen food fresh out of the deep fryer.  But only if the quality of the frozen food was decent, which was clearly not the case with these onion strings.  But you don't go to a BBQ joint for the appetizers and sides, you're looking to dig into the ribs, right?  The MCB menu boasts that Mike Mills' ribs have won several prestigious BBQ competitions.  If that's true, then there's no way Mike Mills still owns or operates MCB because any self-respecting BBQ judge would have spat out the ribs I was served.  First of all, as one who grew up in Barbecue Country (Kansas City), I can spot barbecue fraud from a mile away.  What's barbecue fraud, you ask?  BBQ fraud is baked, as opposed to wood-smoked.  You will never see a wisp of smoke coming out of Famous Dave's, Lucille's, or MCB.  And if it ain't smoked, it ain't barbecue.  By just baking the meat, you avoid all the grime, heat, and eye-burning smoke of wood-smoking.  The problem is that the baked fraud stuff is mediocre at best (Lucille's, for example) and horrible at worst (MCB).  The MCB ribs were fatty (the smoking, or baking, process should be long enough to render most of the fat out of the ribs), the dry rub had no discernible flavor, and the sauce tasted like the generic bottled variety.  OMG, Worst. Ribs. Ever.  Because I have such a vicious sweet tooth, a half-decent dessert does much to wipe away the memory of a bad meal.  If only the dessert at MCB were even half-decent.  I would have settled for quarter-decent.  I got the banana pudding, which tasted like an instant pudding mix.  And not even a decent, name-brand instant pudding mix but some cheap, generic substitute.  Blech! it was an awful way to end truly awful meal.  There are only three BBQ joints in Las Vegas that wood-smoke their meat:  Top Notch, Rollin' Smoke, and Annie's Kitchen.  I love both Top Notch and Rollin' Smoke, eat at both places often.  Never tried Annie's, but I'll have to go sometime because I hear from a fellow BBQ-loving Kansas Citian that it's terrific.  I wouldn't eat at MCB again if you paid me."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite BBQ place. Too bad it is barely eatable now. I had the St. Louis rib and hot link combo. 4 stars for the hot links! The Red Beans and Rice was good but lacking? The St. Louis Ribs UCK! Did they boil these right before we got there? They were fatty and barely done.NOT slow cooked all day or even an hour. I ordered a beer to try and wash it down and had to go looking for the server after waiting 15 minutes. No bartender in the bar (and no customers surprise!) there were only 5 or 6 tables with people and 4 or 5 servers. No excuse for service to be this bad!  BTW. Sam Schmidt's photo is gone. (local Indy Racer) Did he remove it because the food is not up to standards?"}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of this place!  It has been one of your usual stops when in town on vacation.  The BBQ is authentic and the quality of the meats is great!  We like all styles of barbecue and MCB seems to deliver a satisfying and hearty meal.  One could never complain about portion sizes here, I'm a big eater and I have never been able to finish my meal :) Try one of the meat combos for a sampling of different items like burnt ends, ribs, pulled pork etc...  the fried pickles are EXCELLENT!  Keep up the good work and I'm looking forward to living in town so we can come more often."}
{"text":"I left a glowing review for your closed location... I still stand by that review but the last two times I have been into this location the Ribs have been completely DRY and OVERCOOKED!   If it were once I would say that it was an off night but here we are now two times in a row, I think you need to examine who is overcooking your meat.  BBQ is all about TENDER and JUICY, not DRY and HARD.   I hate to leave such a bad review but if I were the management I would wanna know when the food is going DOWN HILL and brother something is off in that kitchen!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill, I used to like it. The food isn't fresh like it used to be and the flavors are just not there anymore. Their staff is sub par and will mess up your order very often. The staff can be rude and the managers refuse to take proper responsibility for their staff mess ups. I will never visit this place again unless I want to get ripped off, get poor service, not get half of what I paid for, and end up with a bad stomach ache."}
{"text":"Short: Might want to go somewhere else. Good service, but half-way decent food. Not worth price.  Long: Let's say I got comped for free lunch/dinner, all paid for. So, I arrived at 4 (when is was pretty dead), got seated quickly and waited on nicely. Nothing to complain about in the service. Ordered coke (got a large mug) and their \"sampler\" appetizer. This had onion shreds, fried pickles, burnt ends, and some potato skin things. Onion shreds were like all others I've had, pickles were too--so I have to question if they were frozen. Burnt ends weren't \"real\" burnt ends, just boneless--sometimes pure fat--that have been smoked and slathered in sauce. Good, but not true burnt ends. The potato skin things were decent, but the pork, cheese, and whatnot tasted all the same, so it's kind bland. My entree was baby-back ribs, brisket, and white meat smoked chicken. I LOVED the wing off the chicken--tender, juicy, flavorful. BUT, the breast meat of the chicken was dry as all hell. Brisket wasn't sliced, and tasted like it had been sitting around. Why not slice brisket? Seriously? Half of it tasted like I was eating tree bark. With the half-rack of ribs, the \"towards the center\" was tender, but low on flavor. The other side \"towards the end\" was pretty tough. There was an overall lack of smoke flavor, and flavor at all, from the ribs. (I sampled ribs at Sprouts--a grocer--and found their ribs to be much better). So a chain focused on their awards on ribs fell pretty short here for me. My sides were macaroni and cheese--which had some cheddar velveta--and rice and beans, which was fine but not great. They do have sauces on the side, but they're too runny to actually stay on the meat, and while the flavor is good, you can't taste it on the meat as the sauces are too watered down. In the end, It would have cost me close to $50 for all of this, not including tip, and I just don't see the worth in that. Nothing blew me away.  If you're hard set on this place, go for their chicken wings, burnt ends, and maybe ribs. But, if you're looking, go somewhere else since you'll get better for your money."}
{"text":"We decided on Memphis BBQ  for a change of pace from our usual BBQ restaurants ( famous daves n buzz's BBQ )  I had the full slab of St Louis  style the wife had the brisket plate we both had the collard greens and cole slaw , we also had the doz wings ,  Vegas style , smoked and served crispy.             The ribs were very tender and moist as was the chicken wings, the wifes brisket was a little chewy. The brisket portion was really small about 6 slices. It's a good thing I had the full rack to share. The cole slaw was very good reminded me of buzz's bbq , very good.  Service was good.  They also serve breakfast on the weekends, we'll have to try it"}
{"text":"Craving a slab of juicy flavourful ribs I opted for 3 time world champion Memphis Champ BBQ. Unfortunately the meats were suprisingly dry, tough and often unexceptional. I sampled the wings(ok) the brisket (dry), ribs (reasonable) fried pickles(strange but good) , onion chips(very good)  Nice to get away from the maddening crowds, service was friendly and helpful, sadly food quality needs to be watched more closely."}
{"text":"Ive never evr been so pissed before because of bad food and bad service!!! This place is the most horrible, nasty and disgusting place ive ever been to in vegas!! Lets start with The bbq sauce- water down ketchup, brisket- doesnt even taste like bbq and it taste old and dry!, burnt ends- terrible!! Just taste like beef chuck  thats been boiled the they just threw bbq sauce in it(its disgusting and chewy), smoked turkey- dont taste the smokiness at all!, fried okra- it was cold and soggy, baked beens- tatsed like canned beans, mac and cheese- tasted like boxed mac and cheese with water down sauce!, coleslaw- bland with just vinegar in it! Pulled pork-bland and greasy. Im doing this because i want you guys to save your money and pls go somewhere else! Its not worth it! The quality of the food and the service is bad!!!' I work at a prestigous restaurant and i think i can tell when a place does not care about quality. This place is terrible!"}
{"text":"So I have been here many times, and normally I would probably rank it a four star as I love \"the King\"; there pulled pork is great, but this last week when I went here it was not that enjoyable due to poor service.   Went there this past Wednesday night for dinner. Not many people. Service was prompt but too prompt, we ordered an appetizer, side salad with dinner. The appetizer came out and maybe sixty seconds later the salad and dinners came out. Very poor timing in either the waitress or the kitchens part. No courses and as we ate the appetizer our main course got cold. We told the waitress politely, who laughed, maybe she thought we were kidding or maybe it was a nervous laugh don't know. then she walked away, nothing, no I can take that back, or \"sorry\", or \"I can reheat that\". So the next go around we requested to speak with a manager. The manager was nice enough and agreed with us, he offered to take the food back and had them remake it. I must admit I hate sending food back because I am always worried, what if they do something to the food... but it came back and it was remade, not just sitting under a heat lamp. The server came around quite often after that but it was then almost like two often, I timed it and it was about once every five minutes which is great for drink refills but every time she asked if we were okay and that was a bit much as well. I kept reminding myself better too much service than not enough but it would have served her well just to observe that if we are talking and eating it is okay not to make a comment every few minutes. I read once that the best service is the type that everything is taken care of and you don't realize the waiter is there - and I have had this and it is awesome, but not here.   So other than the poor service; the food was decent. I tried something different this time and got the two meat platter with pork shoulder and burnt ends. I have never had burnt ends before but have seen it on Food Network. I don't think that this was what is typically called burnt ends it was more like chunks of meat with a lot of fat, but they were good rib pieces. I am always a fan of the pork shoulder. Our appetizer was good, smoked wings, good smoke flavor and not dry; and we shared BBQ nachos those were good as well. Lots of meat on the nachos, which is appreciated.   All in all, I always have liked Memphis but it may be awhile before I decide to go back there."}
{"text":"As I am from Memphis, I had very high hopes for this place. They need to change the name, cuz I don't want people to think that Memphis BBQ tastes like this! The sides were ok well the mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes,  but collard greens should never be sweet and baked beans shouldn't have pickle relish in it! Don't bother!"}
{"text":"hmmmmm, not very good I guess since the road block there not cooking good food or the food just isnt good, beans are super sweet. brisket is not smoked if it is not for long, Turkey was ok, service not good  the guy that was working was very nice. I know he was a good server, but he was not ours."}
{"text":"We did not feel like driving all the way to the Strip or hit up another chain restaurant. This place was close to where we live (the base) so we had dinner there. The menu was extensive, but they had a great price for a full rack of baby backs. They were incredible. The meat came off the bone with ease. The dry rub, Magic Dust, added a ton of flavor. The drizzle of sauce was enough to add a tang to it without drowning it. It was perfect. The red beans and rice and homemade cole slaw were great. The large homemade roll with honey butter was great. Had the banana pudding for dessert. Tasted my wife's dessert, apple crisp. Both were yum. The decor and service were comfortable and low key. Not ostentatious like other barbeque places tend to be. This place has been around for a long time and subtly refers to its longevity with all the thank you memorabilia on the walls. A great meal, will go back again..."}
{"text":"Sometimes a bbq joint knocks it out of the park, other times.....nots so much. Pulled pork was fantastic however the \"award\" winning sauce was a little weak. The rubs were too salty and dry. Wasn't horrible but not worth the hype. Service was slow and when my server did show up, was pushy"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times.  The most recent visit was last week.  I had the sausage with hush puppies, collard greens, and deviled eggs. It was delicious.   Everything was well seasoned with a good kick to it.  The portions were good sized and even though I got take-out, it was hot and fresh.  I love this bbq place!"}
{"text":"Worst BBQ by far that I've had in las vegas.  Got the 5 meat combo with two sides. And the combo fried dill pickles and onion straws. For pick up .For 35 dollars.   Smallest portions I have ever seen.  Brisket dry and chewy,  pulled pork was dry and flavorless , no seasoning,  chicken was juicy but no smoke flavor or seasoning tasted like oven roasted chicken.   Ribs were flavorful but a lil dry,  and like 2 bones with no meat on them.  Loved the burnt ends.  Very flavorful, and smokey. The two sides I tried the mac n cheese which was really good, but smallest portion ever.  Like 3 fork fulls literally.  And tried the hush puppies which were good, but you get 5 of them the Size of a quarter max. The fried dill pickles and onion straws were very oily pretty much inedible.  Maybe It was late when I was there so I caught the HEAT LAMP LEFTOVERS!  Flavorless bland BBQ.  When I contacted customer service. No reply even.  Wont be going back, unless they make this right."}
{"text":"Upon entering the hostess was texting...not the best of first impressions but I can understand since it was virtually dead inside.   I read about the King Sandwich and the Apple Blossom Iced Tea. The tea was good, the sandwich was somewhere between moist and...not moist.   Also, at a BBQ joint, I dont want to sit down amongst Denny's inspired decor and order from a server next to an abundance of fake plants. The best bbq restaurant I have been to is in El Paso, called Rudy's. Best ever...you see the meat, you choose it, you eat it, fresh. Only real positives were the delightful server and the tea."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The creamed corn and banana pudding are my fav. Drive through is convenient!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome breakfast on the weekends. You just have to check it out. The wait staff is friendly, there is often a manager roaming the tables just checking on everyone, and the bacon is to die for. All the breakfast meat is actually. Not to mention the praline french toast bites they have as an appetizer. Surgery sweet and kind of heavy, but lick your fingers good. We have now been on at least four occasions."}
{"text":"Solid three stars, not bad but not amazing.  The King is always a go to favorite, did not disappoint.   Give it a try."}
{"text":"The service is good, but \"championship\" didn't really come to mind, more like \"Decent\". I'd go back, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"The pulled pork and hamburgers are wonderful!!  Highly recommend this place to all and be careful of the generous portions!!"}
{"text":"The family went to memphis bbq the other day and had the ribs, stuffed potato, pulled pork and fried pickles all of which were amazing - I got the stuffed potato with beans and it was really good. I would get it with extra chili next time since it was so tasty. My son got the pulled pork which he seemed to really enjoy. My cousin got the ribs and couldn't stop licking his fingers. There was a lot of construction so it was a little difficult to get to."}
{"text":"We showed up for lunch and the place was busy. We waited for nearly 15 minutes. The restaurant sported a Comprehensive barbecue menu. I ordered a half rack of the baby back ribs with beans and slaw. The ribs were almost dry - not moist and juicy as expected. The beans and slaw were very good. Service was good and prompt. Prices were ok."}
{"text":"Although it may not be authentic Memphis city BBQ, it's still pretty dang good!  They give you these rolls when you order your drinks and they are extrememly tasty. They have some kind of honey butter to go with them.  The price is excellent for the quality of food they serve. Their salads are delicious.  And the environment is very laid back and fun. The service was great.  Definitely recommend eating here if you're in the mood for BBQ!"}
{"text":"I enjoy barbecue and have had my fair share of barbecue that's advertised to be \"the best\" or \"world famous.\" Memphis has delivered tastey barbecue every time I have visited. My favorite two things to order are the burnt ends and club sandwich (which is only on the lunch menu).  Mac and cheese (sprinkle some magic dust on top!) And hush puppies are my favorite sides.  Despite other reviews I have always received excellent service from the staff."}
{"text":"The drive thru food is not the same as dining.  It was hard, cold and did not have sauce on it.  I called to complain and the manager spoke as though we did something  wrong.  He was not solution oriented.  We spent about $40. For inedible food.  I will not be eating there again because of the poor customer service and food."}
{"text":"Why we came? For the convenience near Nellis....never doing that again.  One word horrible. I ordered the sliders lunch special and my husband ordered ribs. Wow!  Tasteless!  Our sides were mac and cheese, collard greens and creamed corn.  The sides were tasteless and salty. Nasty. Service was awful too."}
{"text":"BBQ is good; great flavor in the rub for the meats.  I would not choose a non meat item.  My wife had the catfish and it was so so.  Service was really friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I love good Barbecue. When i moved to Vegas i quickly noticed there really is not a whole lot of Barbecue places in Vegas. Driving around, i noticed signs saying \"Memphis Championship Barbecue\". With a name like that, which is quite self-serving, they have to be of some quality, They won awards. But no. this place was far from championship.  For starters the place was empty when we went there. When the place is empty you would think food service would be quicker but  it was very slow. the menu looks good but when the food comes out brace yourself. The food is tough and flavorless. they offer a sauce, which is generic like you could buy off the shelf at any store, and then they also give you the option of thier FAMOUS RUB. The Rub was even worse. So a bad rub on dry meat with generic sauce and sub-par sides. slow service to top it all off? I will pass. FYI to anyone who has a BBQ restaurant. Vegas needs you, and this is your town to own if THIS is the best we have."}
{"text":"Awesome place, EXCELLENT food.  Amber is so nice, always seem to get her or Steven who is great also. I eat here every time I am in Las Vegas.  Good BBQ is hard to find in so cal.  Please read the picky reviews carefully, this isnt Chili's crap BBQ.  Its Memphis style which is the Memphis southern style food."}
{"text":"The people up front are nice but my pickup order was cold and the food was HIGHLY mediocre.  I wish I could say it was better but its really just  not good."}
{"text":"Pretty sad to be called a BBQ place. Brisket looked like baby food. Do not recommend and the wait staff both times I have been there were horrible"}
{"text":"Alright!!  About to try some BBQ!!  The baby-back ribs, collared greens, green beans and Mac & cheese was awesome.... They give a lot of food..."}
{"text":"I used to love this resteraunt, but the last few times we have gone, it was lacking. This time we got a waitress that was new and apparently she was not trained very well because she couldnt answer any of my questions about what was in certain foods. I think if your staff doesnt know the menu, then they shouldnt be on the floor! period. Once I placed my order and waited for about 40 minutes, my dinner finally arrived and what a suprise, it was COLD! So I am not sure if it was sitting back there for a while and she just didnt deliver, or the cooks served cold food. I can say that I will NOT be going back here any time soon :/ It is dissapointing because like I said, this was one of my favs."}
{"text":"Found this gem a few years ago while visiting my mom and have since made it a regular annual stop, had Mama Faye's Supper last Thursday for 4, meats & sides were delish, waitress Angela was super friendly & helpful, we gorged ourselves & still had a ton of leftovers. Glad we stuck with a proven winner, we love this place!"}
{"text":"stepped on in while visiting Nellis AFB. I had the bbq brisket w/ collards & mac/cheese. worked off my hunger w/ no probs. thumbs up for all the air force memorabilia, and the patch collection from visiting air crews was a cool treat. service was brisk/polite.  a simple joint."}
{"text":"It is really hard for me to give a rib joint a bad rating due to the fact that I am a rib lover. So I maybe just a bit biased when reviewing rib joints. Having said that, the sauce here at Memphis Championship is what sets them apart. It is so good and the magic dust seasoning is just awesome. All the the sides are good and have a home made flavor to it. I do not really care about the service because for me...it is all about the tender juicy ribs!"}
{"text":"As a local for close to 10 years, I have eaten at alot of places. I had eaten here about 4 years ago and it was OK and filled my Texan craving for BBQ. It has dropped to I won't return and should have stayed with Famous Daves BBQ.(easliy 4 stars), but I had a coupon. The only reason it got 2 stars was the waitress and my coupon. My wife and I both had baby back ribs. Hers were cold,not kinda warm,cold!! Mine were above cold, just bearly. We returned them and they came back burnt on the outside. We scraped them and dined,because I had a coupon and not enough time to go elsewhere. Not alot of flavor when the BBQ sauce is removed and they were kinda tough. It seemed they were boiled not long enough. I had mac and cheese, more like elbows and Velveeta. Too bad, this was an OK place, not anymore!!"}
{"text":"Casual place to go get BBQ in Vegas. We have been there multiple times and it's consistent. Only issues have been 1 the addiction to their biscuits 2 the drive through order can be wrong so check your order"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in and waited up front for 8 minutes while staff looked directly at us and walked the other way. I know they are busy as we come here often, but this time it's super slow. A young girl (one of the ones who looked me in the eye and didn't seat us) finally approached and just said how many. I said 2. She said, last name? We told her. She then asked the party behind us the same questions. She wrote us on her clipboard and walked off. Umm... 5 minutes?? An hour??... she just left without saying anything! Another young girl approached and helped us. We waited 6 minutes for a server on a dead night once we were seated. Service here blows. I guess come when they're crazy busy to get the service you deserve."}
{"text":"You like casual BBQ, served up fast and friendly?  Yeah, who does not right?  This place is great.  Located off strip has a great full bar and casual atmosphere.  Staff is over the top friendly and out to please.  When you tire of all the strip bs and prices, get yourself over here and enjoy!  A special extra note for if you have having to do an event in Vegas.  We recently booked the place for about 50 guests.  Did all the arrangements from out of town working with their fantastic groups person Markini.  Everything came off exactly how it was supposed to have, actually even better.  Guests were pampered, some corkage fees got waived for toasts and the food for the group was just as good as if we had ordered for four."}
{"text":"I  disagree   that  this  is  a  good  eaterey.  You  would  be  far  smarter  to  go  to  Famous  Dave's.  The  food  is  excellent.  We  are  locals  and  we've  tried  them  all."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and the pork shoulder has always been great and the apple sweet tea is a must. The fried onion straws are really good too. Service is usually good but the chicken tends to be dry and the hush puppies are on the small and crunchy side."}
{"text":"Great baby back ribs, collard greens and huge sweet potatoe w/ brown sugar & butter- yummmm- best sweet tea outside of the south! Chili great as well. Service fast and friendly- pretty busy but did not have to wait for a table on a Friday @ noon!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I got the St Louis rib and brisket combo.  The ribs were ok.  The brisket had been steamed or pressure cooked.  It didn't have a full smoky flavor and had an odd texture.  The sauce was just ok. Had vegetable mix and slaw as my sides.  The veggies had too much butter and it was thin vinegar sauce for the slaw which was ok.  Portions were huge.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Oh my God, this place is like heaven to me.  The ribs, the BBQ sauce, the pulled pork.  It melts in your mouth.  I have never been to the other locations, only the Warm Springs one, and I like it because it's away from the strip and the tourists.  They sent me a coupon for my birthday for a free rack of ribs.  I think it was one of the best days of my life when they brought those ribs out to me.  If you could have seen my face...  I was happy.  I cannot go to Vegas without visiting this place.  It's the best BBQ I've ever had."}
{"text":"Yes its good, and the service is ok, but they are not consistant.  As far as the ribs go, I have had them excellent there, and have had them nasty its a 50/50 split I guess and I hate that. They arn't expensive so that's a plus!   So yes they are good and I would \"lightly\" recomend it, however I believe Buzz Bbq to be of better consitancy."}
{"text":"As I went to write this, I read cold meat in another review, andl they were not kidding.  My entire meal was cold to the point where I will be calling the health department as it is not safe to keep meat at this temperature.  The brisket had more fat than meat and the hot link was so old there was no moisture in it at all. The yeast rolls may have seen an oven a day or to ago and looked like they were par baked.  Only someone forgot to finish baking them, also stone cold.  $40 down the drain and NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Always a goto stop when in Vegas. Babyback ribs r amazing.  All meat no fat. Boston transplant servers. Prices are fair and  always leave filled and in need of a nap. Worth a drive from the strip. Hv been 10+ times and never disappointed. Awesome!!  !"}
{"text":"I showed up about 1 1/2hr before closing ordered 2 combo plate servers we nice place was clean and they got my order to me in a decent time. When I arrived in my room which was five min away excited I opened my food to find that it was very old like it's been sitting there all day. My chicken was cold and my ribs had that crystal look and if you know anything about meat that's not good it's from being pre cut and air getting to the meat drying it out. The bun was the best part of the meal I'm sure if I went when they opened I would of had a better experience but still the quality control was not there this evening."}
{"text":"Actually if I could this would be 0 stars. After 45 mins of waiting on appetizers, having to ask for a drink refill and then our food coming out before the app and being completely wrong, I walked out. I have never walked out on a table in my life. I served tables for 5 yrs myself. Very very very disappointed."}
{"text":"I thought about giving this place 3 stars until we ate at Tony Romas and realized that their BBQ just wasn't that good.  Not that I wouldn't return but I'd much rather go someplace else. My pork ribs were meaty but dry and not very tender.  The fried okra was very old and soggy, with the coating all destroyed. The honey butter was good and so was the service."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with fair prices! Would absolutely come back again and bring friends. This place is conveniently located at two major streets. I like the cups here too."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am not the biggest fan of bbq but this place makes me like alot more. Good homestyle cooking with sweet tender meats. I like going here at lunchtkme as its really never busy that time of day. Service has always been very good. Interior needs some updating but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre BBQ at best. Absolutely nothing stands out and overall very disappointing. Only reason it gets so many people is due to its proximity to a military base."}
{"text":"I thought the service was good, with the waitress being very attentive, and I loved the burnt ends of brisket. The other things were just OK. I didn't care how the pork roast was chopped up into little bits like dog food. I've seen this done at other places and don't get why they do that. The ribs were OK and a bit on the dry side. The mac & cheese was good, and the greens were just OK. I'm still on the search for a real barbecue place that pulls the food hot off the grill and serve it to you. I could tell their meat was sitting in some hot plates (perhaps not the burnt ends)."}
{"text":"During our visit to Las Vegas, we ventured out to have dinner at Memphis Championship Barbecue - Warm Springs location.  It was a bit of a late dinner arriving there around 8:00pm.  The waiter we had was EXTREMELY friendly and accommodating.  We were seated very quickly at this time of night.  Trying to decide what to order was a real challenge.  Based on the descriptions of each of the dishes, we wanted to order one of everything.  After some discussion, we decided on the Grand Champion Plate and the dish where you choose your favourite style: baby back, St. Louis or beef plus two other meats.  We selected coleslaw and baked beans as our two side dishes.  It's the absolutely best BBQ I've ever had!  Everything we had was very tender and moist.  The pulled meats were something to die for!!  I was very surprised with the coleslaw.  It is not the coleslaw I was use to having with the creamy sauce but soaked in vinegar.  Very very appetizing!!  Both my kids were a little apprehensive eating the food simply because they've never been here before.  Once they started, they continued to eat until they were full.  This is always a GREAT sign since they're both picky eaters.  My daughter actually wanted me to order more pulled brisket.  Throughout our meal , the waiter kept coming by regularly to ensure our visit to the restaurant was pleasant.  The atmosphere was very country and fitting for this restaurant.  At this location, there were many families having dinner at Memphis Championship Barbecue which is a GREAT sign.  Not many tourists here simply because it is about a 10-15 minute drive away from the strip.  I highly recommend people reading my review to try the food at Memphis Championship Barbecue if they're in the Las Vegas.  I will definitely be having dinner there the next time I'm in town."}

{"text":"I've been here twice.  The first time I think I just got a salad and a Fat Tire beer.  I thought it was okay, and after going to Famous Dave's BBQ a few times since -- and really enjoying the BBQ flavors  there -- I decided to return to Memphis BBQ for a change.  This time I got the pulled chicken sandwich with sides of cole slaw and a vegetable medley.  My friend got a four-meat platter.  We were both quite disappointed.  I expected the chicken to be more flavorful than it was.  I took half the sandwich home and finished it later.  It was edible, but nothing to celebrate.  The cole slaw was just awful.  It tasted sour.  I just took a couple of bites of that and didn't even take the rest of it home with me.   The vegetable medley was okay.  My friend's opinion of the four-meat platter was that it was a one-note dish.  All the meats she chose (chicken, beef brisket, pork burnt tips, and Louisiana ribs) tasted pretty much the same.  Like the chicken on my sandwich, they were not well-sauced, and you couldn't escape the overly-pungent smokiness of the dish.  I tasted one of her pork burnt tips and was put off by the smoked flavor myself.  Lesson learned.  I won't be going back to Memphis BBQ.  If you want great BBQ, I would recommend Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"This was recommended by a local friend as one of the good BBQ places in the area.  I had the baby back ribs, was wanting beef but they had dropped those awhile back, and also had burnt ends.  The burnt ends were good, the baby back ribs really didn't seem like anything special to me.  I did try both of their BBQ sauces, which I'm pretty particular about and didn't love either.  In the end I ate both with just a little of their original sauce preferring the rack dry with seasoning.  Service was good and friendly.  I just wasn't blown away, I think the back of the house needs to step it up with consistency and do more with improving items on the menu or bring back beef ribs."}
{"text":"We used to eat at Famous Dave's BBQ but the last few times the food just wasn't all that great. Decided to give this place a try and OMG bye bye Famous Daves. Food was really good, hot and fresh. I have the baby back ribs and they were just delish!! The baked beans were a bit different than any other baked beans I've had in the past but very good. Hush puppies were great as well! Pat was our server and he was excellent. This is our new go to BBQ place!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Friday.  Had the burnt ends, and beans.  The plate comes with a muffin and honey butter.  The honey butter is delish.  There were 12 1/2\" cubes of meat on the plate smothered in sauce....very meh....good taste, not enough meat.  The beans remain good, although there was a LOT of sauce in the bowl this time.  They remain 3 star, and severely disconnected food wise from Memphis's best."}
{"text":"I have a new favorite restaurant in Las Vegs. The portions are huge and the food is excellent. I had the Grand Champion Plate with baked beans and fries. I can not decide what was the best."}
{"text":"I had my son's wedding catered from here. They were prompt, set up for us and the food was great. We had the smoked prime rib which was tender and juicy. The mac and cheese was the best I have had, really creamy. My favorite side was the cucumber salad, crisp sweet and sour. The creamed corn was really sweet and delicious. The chicken and brisket were perfect.  I can't say enough. Everything was delicious they supplied all the plates forks and napkins.  Would definitely use them again."}
{"text":"This place was just \"OK\". One of the reasons I choose a restaurant is to get food I can't get at home. In this restaurant's defense, I was referred there to try the ribs--and I ordered something else--The combo platter with hot links, pulled pork, and briskett; all were good, however I wouldn't order the pulled pork again, just didn't impress me. Baked beans & Macaroni & cheese were absolutely wonderful.   The service, well it was just slow and unnattentive. We're talking about serving food that is 100% pre-cooked, so after the order is placed it should simply be the time it takes to plate the food and bring it to the table. 40-mins? I counted six customers in the place.  I was hoping for a good hole-in-the wall BBQ joint, but what I got was a chain restaurant, and if I wanted that, I would've gone to Lucille's."}
{"text":"Just ate there less than an hour ago.. our waitress was so sweet and nice and was very attentive to our needs.. but the food was horrible.. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and my husband ordered the black and Bleu burger and we ordered an order of corn bread muffins.. first of all the corn bread muffins were dry and too well done.. second my sandwich was just dry chicken with a glob of bbq sauce on it and the magic dust.. my husband's burger was supposed to be medium rare and came out well done.. the macaroni and cheese must have been like a stouffers  mac and cheese.. I was really disappointed cause I thought this place was supposed to be a championship bbq place.."}
{"text":"Arguably the best ribs I've ever had!  Had some training dept. managers at my old job take us out for dinner a few years ago.  Damn that was an awesome feast!"}
{"text":"The food here was decent, but it lacked real barbecue flavor.  I just felt that it was a bit plain tasting.  I had a two meat plate at lunch with burnt ends and brisket.  The burnt ends weren't cooked long enough, and I like them served a bit crispy.  The brisket was just really plain.  Both sauces on the table were also very sweet, nothing spicy.  I tried my girlfriend's pork shoulder, which they are known for, and wasn't impressed either.  Being from Kansas City maybe I'm a tough critic on barbecue but this place didn't seem to be anything special."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place to eat. Not to mention a great place to have a small wedding reception. My new wife and I booked here to have our wedding reception. John, one of the managers, was great!! He was able to meet with us and go over exactly what we wanted to do. They set up the room perfectly! We had a great time and great food! We will definitely come back as well as recommend them to anyone who is looking for great food! The staff are very nice, especially the ones helping with the reception! Thank u all for sharing our moment and making the experience one we will never forget!!"}
{"text":"We eat here often and realized I have never written a review.  The food is good.  It's pretty consistent, so comfortable knowing what you are going to get.  I often drive through and get the bulk meat, like a pound of pulled pork, take it home and make something using it as the main ingredient.  They are willing to accommodate most whims.  Do have two complaints.  1.  On the potato skins, description says they give you four.  They give the skin of one potato, cut in half lengthwise then in half vertically.  To me that is not four.  That is two cut in half.  2.  And others will not find it a negative... they only sell Pepsi products.  I am a Coke products fan.  Maybe that;s why I take it home.  So I can have my own beverage.  Will continue to be a fan."}
{"text":"Not good at all.  Cooking meat then putting BBQ sauce on it is not real BBQ!  The guy who seated us was a dick, and the waitress got my order wrong...completely wrong...like I ordered BBQ chicken and got a pulled chicken sandwich wrong.  They may actually cook their meat right for some items, but the chicken on my pulled chicken sandwich (which I didn't even order) was basically like boiled chicken with BBQ sauce on it! Stay away."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.  Good decor and I got excited when the brought our drinks in mason jars.......But, Brisket sandwich I had was the toughest brisket meat I ever had.  Taste was good but this is not how brisket should be.   Hopefully this was a fluke.  I may try eating here again but the cold fries  capped off a bad plate."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Street vendor provides better quality food and service. But before I lay down my review, I'll give props and say that both the potato/cucumber salad were bomb -- but even with these sides there was nothing regional about its presentation.   ... I began with the (so called award-winning) Combo Basket Appetizer; fried pickles with Onion rings, where I ended up choking down a grease-smothered (and limp) so-called pickle no thicker than a dime. Gross!   I tried staying positive as I awaited my order of the pulled chicken sandwich, but even that was just okay. Good white meat, but nothing great. Even their \"signature\" sauce was nothing special, but I'm sure they have a few to-do items. Unfortunately they didn't earn a return customer so I won't find out. :-("}
{"text":"I'm from Texas so I have a strong opinion when it comes to BBQ, especially brisket.  Service was quick, which is a plus since we went during lunch and had to get back to work.  Lots of food choices and a separate lunch menu.  I had the Blue Ribbon Lunch one meat + one side with brisket and subbed the side for the soup of the day, parmesan potato.  The rest of the family had burgers: A.B.C., Kansas City Black & Blue, and Barbecue. We enjoyed the meal and will visit again."}
{"text":"Went to pick up lunch today, walked in and waited more than a few minutes before I even saw an employee. Finally placed an order, and the employee disappeared with my credit card to the back. Employee returned with the receipt to sign and it took several more minutes for my food.  I got to my friend's house not far away, and despite the fact it had been less than 5 minutes, the fries were already cold and not that great. Baked beans had a weird flavor and were also kind of cold. Finally, the pulled pork sandwich was also underwhelming and cold. Sauce had way too much vinegar. Cole slaw looked disgusting, like it had been made several days before.  They probably still could have salvaged a second star, except that the customer service managed to drop even after I had left. I realized after I got home that when the employee disappeared with my credit card, she failed to bring it back. So I called, to verify that that's where I left it. I explained the situation to more than one employee and was repeatedly put on hold. They confirmed that she kept my card when she swiped it, but they refused to mail it back to me. Apparently they have a policy that they can only give it back to me if I come in, in person, and show ID. This place is across town, and there's no way I'm driving an hour round-trip to go pick up my card. I just don't see how this policy is anything but nonsense. Do they really think that someone else would figure out that my card was missing, and then be able to figure out where I left it before I do, and then intercept it, and then manage to make fraudulent charges? The whole thing is ridiculous. Not to mention that if they just had a credit card machine up in the front, where they take all of the takeout orders, this never would have happened.  All-in-all, I wish I would have passed, what started as a mediocre, over-priced lunch managed to turn into a real headache."}
{"text":"Family came here a couple weeks ago to try it out. WAY BETTER than famous Dave's. Our server was super friendly, food was delicious, and price for all of us wasn't too bad, even though my 13yr old ordered rib eye . We're here again today bc I was craving burnt ends . This place is legit! Our server today was equally friendly. Our new after church lunch spot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to Vegas and were looking forward to tying out this \"championship\" bbq place right around the corner from us. What a disappointment! The fried pickles were pretty good (nothing to write home about), and the bread with honey butter was tasty. My brisket was awful and my husbands pulled pork was pretty much tasteless. We will not be returning and the search for an amazing bbq place is still on!"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to Memphis BBQ and the first time I LOVED it.  On this visit...not so much.  On this trip the mac & cheese was totally watery.  The Fried okra was cooked strange...like I got the left overs at the bottom of the pot.  The brisket was ok, but not what i remembered.  I get discouraged when places are up and down like this.  Hopefully your trip is better than my 2nd trip."}
{"text":"Friendly service, BBQ sauce wasn't sweet like I remembered it being & the apple flavor in the sauce just wasn't there. Brisket, pulled pork & loin back ribs were very tasty."}
{"text":"I had to come here one last time before leaving, it was that good!   The BBQ is amazing!  The burnt tips dinner was my favorite.  The sauce was a beautiful blend.  The sweet teas was authentic tasting and I just had to try their Apple blossom tea, which was unique and delicious!  I expected an almost Apple juice taste to the tea, but that was not the case and my pallet was delighted by the delicate flavors in my giant mason jar!   The cucumber salad was great, as was the potato salad.  The guys at the table couldn't get enough of the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ , Had a large group and Everyone enjoyed their meal, even \"The Vegitarian \" we had to drag here , Raved about the fried pickles"}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch here the other day! Ordered brisket with a side of fried okra and a roll. I thought it tasted great, one of the better bbq places I have had here in Vegas. I also tried their apple tea, which to my surprise was very tasty! Staff was polite and the restaurant itself seemed clean and well kept."}
{"text":"I love this place, never disappoints. I always get the burnt end which are so good. Ive tried their smoked wings, baked beans, mashed potatoes, the yummy bread rolls, ribs and everything is good. The sweet apple blossom ice tea is so good too"}
{"text":"MCB is one of the best BBQ places in town.  I say \"one of the best\" because I sometimes find that the meat can be dry.  The beans, cole slaw and fried pickles are to die for, though."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Very attentive. Unfortunately the meats were a little over cooked. We ate around 6 pm so I thought the meats would be a little less cooked, after all it was dinner time. I would still go back again, the flavors were great just over cooked."}
{"text":"Drinks come in a large jar. Baked beans are sweet and delicious. We split a full rack of baby back ribs. My side was tough but my husbands was soft. The ribs have a dry rub with some sauce on top. The coleslaw is vinegar based not mayonnaise based it tasted okay. The potato salad is okay too."}
{"text":"doesn' get any better than this. If you want some real barbeque, this is the only place to get it. I come here every time I go to Vegas, and something about this place gives me that warm and comfy feeling. The ribs are amazing, mainly because fo the way they smoke them ( i believe its a few weeks?, not to sure). The sauce is unbeatable and the fried okra, is perfect. The portions are also pretty good, not too much. If you dont eat pork, I dont necessarily suggest this place. If you try this place, you wont be sorry!"}
{"text":"This is a MUST GO TO if you enjoy BBQ and are anywhere close to Las Vegas.   I was over-the-top surprised by the quality of food and the friendliness of the staff. Very touristy looking from the outside (big red barn) but don't be fooled. The best baby back ribs I have ever eaten! Get the baby back ribs and brisket if you must choose two.   I also tried their fried dill pickles, sweet apple tea, cole slaw, & mac and cheese. Everything was good but the ribs steal the show!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times however it's primarily been out of convenience and not because the food is that outstanding.  Now I will admit that I probably don't know or understand what \"real\" BBQ is.  However, I do know that BBQ is a process and not to be rushed.  Everything about this place to me seems rushed and not in a good way.  I've been to many BBQ places and there is a usually a sense of pride when presenting the dish.  Here....well it seems the focus is put more on the get in and get out mentality.  Now I understand the economics of the situation.  The more customers you get through the door, the more mighty dollars will go in the pocket. Yeah, that is my Econ 101 class for the day.  With that being said, you don't have to serve something mediocre to enhance that dollar.  Now this is just me talking but if it were me (and it's not), I would strive for that repeat customer and make a BBQ that everyone is going to talk about and want to return to.  I just don't feel like that is the case here.    IMO, the best thing on the menu is their chili.  It's not the first thing I think of when it comes to BBQ but it does taste homemade and is hearty enough to fill ones appetite.  If you must go with something that you can sink your teeth into, I would suggest either the hot links, the catfish or the KC Burger.  All are pretty sold choices and I haven't been let down by any of them.  With regards to their brisket or pulled pork?  Well they are covered in so much slaw, it's hard to tell if there is any meat within the sandwich itself.  Service can be hit or miss. There's been times where we've been treated like kings and others where it has felt as though we didn't exist.  I guess that all depends on the particular server and the time of day that you are there."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight.. since its 4th of July my mom and I decided to feast on some BBQ.  It's been awhile since I last came here, and I had lunch back then, so this time we ordered off the dinner menu.  We split the 3 combo plate & had the St. Louis ribs, brisket, and burnt ends. We also had a choice of 2 sides;  we got the mashed potatoes with gravy and veggies.  The entire order was disappointing. I remember now why I don't really like red meat anymore. The BBQ sauce wasn't that good. The side of mashed potatoes was very sorry tasting and the veggies were very sorry looking (probably came out of a can and just warmed up).  The only thing we enjoyed was the apple sweet tea and bread that came before the main course.  They weren't that busy when we came around 6pm, so the servers were attentive. I also liked how our server gave us a sample of sweet tea as well before placing an order.   However the food was disappointing. I doubt I will be making a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Memphis championship barbecue was not all it was cracked up to be.  The food was okay, but the tablecloths were dingy and frayed.  The restaurant was clean and the servers were very nice , but we 're  from Memphis and it was not Memphis barbecue!   It's an okay restaurant , but not really something I ever want to  go to again.  Their sweet iced tea was the best of all.  I would go back just for their sweet tea!"}
{"text":"This is one of our go to BBQ restaurants. Service is always consistent. The food is awesome. We always get the fried pickles and the sweet apple blossom iced tea. The burnt ends and \"The King\" sandwich are so good. Don't forget the strawberry shortcake!!"}
{"text":"What kind of barbecue joint doesn't include barbecue sauce with your meal?!?  My family ordered the \"Mama Faye's Down-Home Supper\" to pick up today and once we were home, we discovered that there was no sauce to go with all of the food. We assumed it was an oversight, but upon calling the restaurant, we were informed that as of a couple of months ago, sauce no longer comes with this large meal full of barbecued meat. When we asked why no one bothered to mention this when we called to order or when we picked it up, we were given a dismissive non-answer. It's pretty shady to not include sauce in the first place, but it's even worse to not inform your customers and let them get all the way home before discovering how cheap the restaurant has become.   I can no longer recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food's decent enough (with sauce) but who wants to feel like they're being nickel-and-dimed to death by the restaurant they're patronizing?"}
{"text":"Great ribs!  Baby backs were juicy & moist & the St Louis were tasty, tasty, tasty!  Love their butter with the rolls, and the potato salad was fresh & flavorful. A definite do-over!"}
{"text":"I was able to make two meals out of my dinner.Both the hubby and I weren't REAL impressed. He got a 3 meat combo, I got a pulled pork sandwich...which I had to keep dousing in BBq to moisten my palette. Plus everything's good with tons of BBq, although theirs...eh, I've had better. The baked beans were great, and probably the best coleslaw I've ever had.Sweet apple tea was pretty good. It would take a huge coupon or gift card for me to return, but glad I tried it."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and plenty of it! Barbecue snobs need not eat here. Yea, some will be put off by the smokiness of the 'cue but after being barbecue-deprived from nearly a year in the middle of nowhere it was some serious chow action! They also sell their BBQ sauce (regular and spicy), and some BBQ tools as well as their Magic Dust dry rub, which I promptly shipped some to Kwajalein!  Barbecue snobs need not eat here. I'm not one of 'em. If you've got a craving for 'cue, look no further!"}
{"text":"Lunch times are very busy at this location.  We sat down in a small group to eat and were greeted by Bella our waitress.  I ordered up a Kansas City burger and had string onions added to it.  For an appetizer the group settled on some fried pickles.  I have never eaten fried pickles and though tasty my mouth as of this time can not escape the briny, greasy coating it received.  When my burger arrived it was a tad dry.  I did not mind because I would just wash it down with my sweet tea.  Bella was a head of the game when she returned to the table and had the check split  which made for a quick payment and exit.  Lunch time are very busy at this location."}
{"text":"This place is so good they have good baby back ribs that u need to try and they have awesome BBQ nachos it is SO SO SO GOOOOOOOOOODDDDD. Come here please."}
{"text":"This place is authentic and consistent. We have been here (near nellis AFB) 4 times and the food is always amazing. Service is top notch and the waitresses are just sweet as pie. ;-). My fav is the catfish plate. Wow!"}
{"text":"I don't when anyone previously ate at that place but I went there 3 times assuming that place may have had a bad day.  After the third time I have had it.  I would not recommend that place to anyone.  I went there on a slow day even the service was slow.  I ordered some pulled chicken and it tasted very old on the verge of being rotten. My co-worker ordered the fish there she even didn't like her food.  My other co-worker's ribs were dry.  If you would to check it do it at your own risk.  I myself will never go there again."}
{"text":"First of all, anyone who bashes in this place is obviously an over zealous \"high and mighty\" Yelper. Being in the military, and being stationed at Nellis for 3 months, this place is practically off base and is great for some comfort food.  This place isn't gourmet, ritzy, or trying to impress you in any way. All it is, is down home really sweet servers and good food to come with it. The place is covered with squadron patches which is really cool.  I've been here 3 times and had \"The King\" pulled pork sandwich every time! It's so yummy when you're craving a sammich. I keep the coleslaw on it and slather the sticky red sauce in it for maximum sauciness. Wait staff is always so nice and helpful. I'm leaving Nellis today cuz i'm done with my TDY, but i surely will be back!"}
{"text":"Had the King sandwich (pulled pork) which came with cole slaw, the fried okra and the collard greens.  And iced tea.  Total was $12.  Serving size of the pulled pork was a bit too small.  The fried okra was not homemade, nor was the cole slaw.  The texture and taste of both was that they came out of a bag.  Too bad.  Would not go back."}
{"text":"Not bad.    Every BBQ place is different and what sets them apart is the sauce.  This place is a more sour sauce rather than sweet, which is my preference.    Apart from sauce though, which shouldn't really judge the difference between BBQ places, the food came out really quick.  We then noticed that it got lukewarm within about 6-7 minutes.  The meat was bordering 'smushy.' (pulled pork/brisket)  The sides were really good though.  Get the corn muffins."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place only two stars.  I worked here for awhile some 14 years ago and every time I come to visit Vegas (usually once a year) I come by for lunch before leaving town. It has always been great, up until today's visit. To begin with the good: the server was great. Forgot her name. She was also bartending. The chicken was great as well. The rest was disappointing. Both my wife's and my pulled pork was room temperature at best. Wife's brisket was cold as well and so were her fries. Most disappointing of all was that my favorite thing there, red beans and rice, was bland and yet another item to be room temperature at best. My wife and I left in a funk, wondering what has happened to our favorite Vegas BBQ restaurant. Shortcuts? Apathy? Cost cutting measures?"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here, but the food was mediocre. The service was horrible. It wasn't busy but had to wait too long in between being seated,  to ordering drinks, food, even getting the check. Was very disrespected by our server. Worst experience ever. Never had a waiter so disrespectful and threw items at you. Spilled drinks but never offered to clean up the mess, told us to use paper towels. Brandon is the worse server ever. Very prejudice , and disrespectful. If this is a reflection of the company... then I will no longer support this crap establishment. There's no way an establishment can be successful with servers like Brandon."}
{"text":"We come here every time we're at a track event. And it is worth the trip. Real hometown BBQ. You get great proportions for the cost. We've never been disappointed. Well continue to return for great BBQ."}
{"text":"My favorite bbq joint in Nevada!  Stumbled upon it years ago by accident and what a happy accident that was!  Best Burnt Tips I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Can't get to Memphis so came here! BBQ burnt ends are tender pieces of brisket smothered in sweet sticky sauce. The beans and rice have a delectable flavor you can't quite place but it is amazing . The ribs... Oh the ribs are tender and you can taste the seasoning that is deeply embedded in the meat. They also serve some amazing yeast rolls with a sweet cinnamon creamed butter...yum! Unable to finish but got dessert to go bread pudding and apple pie ALA MODE!!! Can't wait to chomp on that later"}
{"text":"I'm a big barbecue connoisseur, so I couldn't NOT check this place out.  Apparently it's a franchise, but it's the first one I've ever been to.  First off, I found it a bit pricey, but I guess that's the cost for \"authentic\" BBQ.  Second, I learned the difference between \"Memphis\" and other style BBQ houses...it's in the sauce.  The Memphis sauce is pale and mustard-y, which is something I was ignorant of until this point.  Needless to say, I'm not a big fan...  I got the combo plate with baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork.  The ribs were nice and tender, but slathered with the yellowish sauce.  The brisket was good.  The pulled pork was a bit dry, so I generously seasoned it with \"Magic Dust,\" which is their brand of dry rub seasoning.  It's delicious.  Now my mouth waters whenever I think about it.  I think they put cocaine in it or something.  I should have swiped a bottle when I had the chance.  Also, their strawberry lemonade was very dull and flavorless.  A far cry from the sweet and refreshing kind at Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ, which was my next stop...  UPDATE: I was compelled back by the \"crack\" seasoning (I nabbed a bottle this time), and I tried the burnt ends and the pulled chicken.  Both were underwhelming -- the burnt ends were tough, the pulled chicken was dry.  I tried it with the Sweet & Sticky sauce this time (redder in color), but it still wasn't to my liking.  Now that I've got it all out of my system, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm a snob when it comes to restaurant service.  I expect good service and tip accordingly.  The service did not disappoint.  The food, however, needs some major revamping.  I had a half a rack of their supposedly award winning baby back ribs.  The meat was dry and had absolutely no flavor.  The two sides I ordered were the fried okra and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it came out of a Kraft Mac and Cheese box.  Also had the three item sampler:  onion straws, fried pickles, and burnt ends.  I kid you not, there was literally a puddle of oil under the wax paper in the basket that held the appetizers.  TGIF's baby back ribs are much more flavorful and their meat is much more savory.  Will definitely not be returning to this place.  Plus one star for the service experienced."}
{"text":"After a long flight to Vegas from New York I wanted something really good and tasty. The food is mediocre. The BBQ sauce taste like hot sauce.  It's sauce is very soupy and spicy. I ordered the ABC burger. The lettuce on my burger was very wilted. It came with one tiny piece of pickle and a dried up tomato. My mom ordered the baby back ribs. Super dry and with little flavor.. I really was expecting some good BBQ. I am disappointed.. The only good experience of this place is the customer service.. I can't recommend this place. I've had way better.."}
{"text":"I love their King Sandwich, which is juicy pulled pork with cole slaw on top.  It has the sweet, yummy flavor of pork and sauce with the sour crunch of the slaw.  Pure heaven."}
{"text":"No way. Had a meal at another location that was pretty good so asked friends to meet us for dinner at this location closer to their house. Waiter was obnoxious and informed me when I was ordering hush puppies not to because they were awful. Wish I'd have listened. Food was lukewarm. Brisket fatty and tough. Ribs not any better. Drinks weren't refilled. Horrible meal for the ridiculous price we paid. When I complained to management, I didn't even get an apology or any other kind of response. Just ignored me. When I posted my experience on their FB page, other than employees bad mouthing me, nothing. Stay away from this location - try Lucille's. MUCH better."}
{"text":"best bbq I've had in forever.  AMAZING ribs, definitely were slow cooked all day and full of flavor. Classic.   All of the sides were really home made tasting and super good.   Service was prompt and super accommodating.   Go here!"}
{"text":"How is it possible to have bad BBQ?  I love food, & cannot believe how disappointing this was. Used to go here when at Nellis. Started with the pork skins..they were ok, like the type you buy in a bag, so nothing special. I ordered the beef sandwich with chili. Hubby who eats EVERYTHING ordered catfish sandwich with okra. Here goes...the little serving of okra's breading was half off, & soaked in oil. This was inedible. We mentioned to the waitress& she said it's a new recipe. Really??? Well, its bad. He attempted to eat his fish sandwich & it was virtually the same. Thin fish doused in oily no seasoned breading. Don't expect the cornmeal southern kind of fish. Hubby was quiet & the waitress didn't ask how it was, so he only ate the bread from the sandwich & mac n cheese. My beef sandwich was a bit dry, but i discovered the sticky red sauce. Yay!  I could've drank this. I want gooey & flavor when I'm at BBQ. The chili was good. I can't believe hubby left hungry & sad. Like i said..this guy doesn't complain. :( The bill was high, & waitress never took off the okra (charged extra side). She had to go out of her way to get the manager which was friendly. He removed it but this place by far is a no go ever again when back in Vegas. The 1 star is for the sticky red sauce. Sigh..."}
{"text":"The only thing that was good were the fried pickled. The BBQ was tough and the meat did not have a lot of flavor. We came in for lunch and the service was slooooow."}
{"text":"Ate there in July. Was one of the worst dining experiences in Vegas. Not true bbq didn't smell any smoke. Rude service. We'll never come back."}
{"text":"Had 3 bites of dinner because the nachos upset my stomach so much. I guess I should have expected that considering the nachos were ready literally 3 minutes after we ordered them. They are NOT MADE TO ORDER OR FRESH!!!! My dessert was Pepto and gingerale once I got home. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"This place was not very good. I went here with my girlfriend who is from Florida. She constantly reminded me that \"this place isn't real barbecue\".  We ordered the 4 meat 2 side combo. It sounds like a lot, but it wasn't. Everything was just OK. It wasnt horrible. But its just generic barbecue. The brisket was good. Ribs we're ok. Chicken was just ok and the pulled pork was sub-par. It basically was like famous daves. Nothing stood out. The service was good, the food just didn't do much for me."}
{"text":"In town for a week and had a class near Nellis AFB for about a week.  One of my classmates brought me here and recommended \"the King\"...BBQ pulled pork...got the 6 oz sandwich and man is that awesomeness...hot juicy meat in my mouth...errr...yeah...but still good.  Came back later that week and got the King again!"}
{"text":"The sauce has a smoked taste but somewhat bland. I'm from NC and thought the Memphis taste would be similar and it hasn't been so far. I've used the online order feature which has made it convienant for me to bring the food home and sample. The cole slaw was very disappointing as I prefer creamy. The mac and cheese has no taste the baked beans had 3 different beans in it- kidney, baked and butter. The wings again, bland. The best so far is the catfish."}
{"text":"First time going it was amazing bbq!! Great tasting food. Big tables and booths and big bar area. If never been check it out and end with the bread pudding it was the best!!"}
{"text":"Lunch menu has lower prices but you do get a smaller size. Happy hour half off appetizers Monday thu Friday 4pm- 6pm dine in only.  Magic dust is worth a try and sticky red sauce!! Free rolls and honey butter are the bomb. Mason jars full of your favorite drinks (hint pink lemonade)"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed.  Walking in looked like I was at a bbq place in S.C., soda served in jars, roll of paper towel on the table, so I couldn't wait to try all the sides and a pulled pork sandwich.  The pulled pork sandwich was really the only item that was half way decent tasting.  My friend had the burnt ends brisket, blech!  Tough meat.  The sides, well the hush puppies were sooo overfried you couldn't chew them.  Green beans, meh, definitely not what Cracker Barrel puts out.  Rest of sides were edible but not seasoned.  I gave it a 3 star as opposed to 2 because our waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Perhaps it was partially due to the fact that I was here for a wedding reception, so the food was plentiful... and free! But regardless, everything we had was great. The pulled pork was by far my favorite, and the chicken my least favorite. The BBQ sauce and magic dust both were divine on everything (especially the french fries!)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best BBQ in Vegas. What's even better is that the food and service are consistently great. Our favorites: ribs, brisket, the king, burnt ends, cream corn, sticky Vegas style chicken wings and the best BBQ nachos you've ever imagined. If you haven't tried Memphis yet, run don't walk."}
{"text":"This location is wonderful, I prefer it so much over the other location. The atmosphere and service & quality are so much better. Are server was by often and constantly refreshing our drinks and bringing bread and dipping sauces. The booth we sat in was clean and comfy and we were seated off to the side which I was happy about, I love a little more privacy and it helps since we brought kids. The food was great and I had no issues with it. When it came to go we still had food left over, I was so grateful they had not only food containers but containers for all our sides so they wouldn't mix together. I think here was the first meal in a long time where everyone ate almost everything they ordered which was ALOT of food. Will be going to only this location from now on."}
{"text":"Overall, decent BBQ place with fun decor and friendly service.  My favorite thing about this place is actually the Apple Blossom Sweet Iced Tea.  Come to think of it, the best sweet tea I've had was when I was actually in Tennessee.  The pulled pork had good flavor, the chicken was a little dry, and the ribs were good.  Meat-wise, this place is only slightly above average, but I try to eat here every time I get to vegas...mostly because of the tea."}
{"text":"Very good. I went here with my boyfriend and we loved it. He's black, so I figure he knows good southern barbecue - and he does. He cooks it all the time, and he cooks gooood!!! I had an excellent brisket meat dish and I loved the sides (there's a meat combo plate that I didn't have - the man next to our table had it and I felt like I ordered the wrong thing... I love meat!!!). Drinks were great ( I had 2 Margueritas) and the ambience and price were fine. Fun night and good hearty food."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my parents there for my Mom's 83 birthday dinner on October 12th.  We had asked for a booth in the back (as it is quieter, my dad is hard of hearing) and they accommodated us with no problem.  Our waiter Patrick, was excellent very attentive, helpful with the menu and making recommendations as this was my husband's and my first time. We were very pleased with our meals (of which we had to take some home) and my husband is very particular with his BBQ meat dishes."}
{"text":"i Unquestionably cherish this spot! It has not only great food but the service is wonderful. My favored would have to be the mac and cheese and the ribs. This place is simply just brilliant! Great caterers too! The quite thin sliced up fried potato placed on the meat was fantastic."}
{"text":"The hunt for great Q in Las Vegas is on, and unfortunately I am still looking.  Things I liked about Memphis Championship Barbecue; The concept, design and décor of this establishment is totally top drawer, I loved it and was comfortable just walking in. The service was polite and efficient and that is a big thing in my book. The booths were roomy and easy to deal with; in fact they were so big we had to slide way in to just get to the table condiments. There was plenty of room to stash my cane and hat without dropping them on the floor.  Before we get to talking Q, let's talk a bit about the sides. With my order I chose Cole Slaw and Baked Beans for the sides. As we all know there are two types of slaw out there, the creamy kind and the vinegar based slaw. The reason for the creamy slaw with Q is that it cuts the spicy heat from foods that are too spicy hot. With Q you really want that or you can get spice overload. A vinegar slaw does just the opposite; it opens your palette and intensifies the spicy flavors. This can make an uncomfortable eating experience in my opinions as the flavor lingers and becomes too bold. I know there are people who will say that it can never be too bold, but I ask you, is it worth it if you can't taste the meat and smoke? Isn't Q about the meat and smoke?  Our server saw my predicament over the slaw and asked if I would like to change it out and I took her up on the offer and selected the potato salad (remember I a looking for something creamy to help refresh the palette.) The potato salad was excellent and just what I needed from a side. I would even order that potato salad for take out it was that good, and that is saying a lot.  My other side was wonderful baked beans. There were 3 or 4 different beans, red beans, white beans and a couple others that I could not identify but were good and earthy. I seem to have detected maybe white onion and green bell pepper with some brown sugar that brought it all together. They were not runny and not too thick, excellent.  My wife ordered corn on the cob and collard greens. The corn was boiled (but it would have been nice grilled) so is a no brainer as corn is just coming into season. As for the collard greens she liked them well enough although she thought they were too rich for her palette.   OK, let's talk meat and smoke...  I have to say this, since I took my wife to a true 5 star Q place she has been a brisket fanatic ever since. Naturally she ordered the brisket from here and discovered that not all brisket is made the same. First off I am not certain the brisket was smoked, because if it was there would have been more of a smoke ring and that seemed to be absent. Also, I am pretty sure it was not cook correctly as there were large streaks of fat still in and on the brisket. (To be honest it reminded my of my Yiddisha Momma's brisket.) It was definitely over cooked though as it was gray through and through. There was some moist meat, but it had that rubbery feel I expect from moms brisket. Here's the thing, brisket is truly the easiest Q there is and this was not up to the standard for what I consider great Q.  I have said this before, I am a beef fanatic and if beef ribs are not on the menu I don't even bother to order. Not that I will turn up my nose to the pig, but beef is where it is at for me. I also consider beef ribs harder to Q because they are thicker requiring watchful temperature control. When I saw beef ribs on the menu I thought, \"Excellent, it is going to be a good evening\"; oh how wrong I was.   There are several cuts of beef ribs, but when I think of beef ribs I think of the prime ribs that are what is left after you butcher the prime rib primal or short loin (back ribs (best) or even short end ribs (ok)). These are BIG AND JUICY ribs because they come from the very best of the steer; all your best cuts come around them. Then there is the middle cut of ribs that is mostly chuck meat and is typically call \"Beef Flanken\". This is a cheap cut and the meat requires a moist cooking (generally braised) application and is rarely used in Q. The last cut is the \"rib tips\" and is not worth talking about in a real Q application (although it is making inroads in wet BBQ circles).  The ribs were beef flanken ribs without the rest of the chuck cut. This is a cheap piece of meat and does not take well to BBQ. Yes, the dry rub was tasty, yes there was a smoke ring (bright pink, caused by the nitrogen dioxide when smoking) but here is the fail, the center was gray, a sure sign of over cooking. Honestly this cut of meat was doomed to leather before it got into the smoker and for a Q place to serve this is an INSULT. I was shocked, then amazed, then really insulted. This was a $17.50 plate of ribs that I honestly should not have been charged more that $7.50, what a rip off.  I was truly disappointed with the Q there; I really wanted to like it. As a dining experience it is fine; as a Q place, consider alternatives."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Next door to our home I'm excited that I can walk here. Great experiance,  looking forward to brining visitors here. Sweet apple tea, brisket, pulled pork, mashed potatoes, ribs , green beans hush puppies!"}
{"text":"WOOOHOOO!!!  I finally got a bbq fix while I was in Las Vegas. I have seen this place online and it was mentioned in a foodtv or travelchannel program about the owner from Murphysboro, Illinois. I looooove bbq so I made it a point to come here. When we got to the parking lot, you could smell the wonderful wood aroma which flavors the meat. We then went inside and were seated right away.   The waitress we had was great. She explained a couple of questions we had and we ended up ordering 4 appetizers. (WAAAAAYYYYY too much food for 2 people.) We had the burnt ends, rib teaser (4 bones), stuffed potato skins (stuffed with shredded pork) and the 3 mini sandwich sampler with chicken, brisket and shredded pork. The sweet tea was also delicious. We got to try a bunch of meats and I think this will be a destination every time I come to Vegas in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious food as usual!  Staff is very friendly!  The BBQ nachos are great!  Their sweet tea is amazing and thirst quenching.  We always go when appetizers are half price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend I wanted to get off the strip for a while and we were craving some good barbecue so we went to this establishment at 9:30pm. Hardly anyone was in the restaurant which made me worry but it was late and a Tuesday night. We ordered a full slab of ribs and the beef brisket. The ribs almost tasted like beef jerky because they had been sitting around for so long. I joked with the server and said I bet these have been in the smoker most of the day? He nodded. Once we bit into the ribs it was ok, but the tops and sides of the slab were all pretty much hard and stiff. I'd be curious to see if someone arrived around 6 PM if the ribs would be any better? Maybe they would be because they would be fresh? I agree with the other comments on this site. The rolls did taste like reheated store-bought ones. The honey butter was very good though. The mashed potatoes reminded me of Kentucky Fried Chicken's mash potato and gravy--disappointing that it reminds me of a fast food restaurant. The beef brisket was actually pretty decent. I really didn't like their BBQ sauces though-- they taste very much like vinegar. The only one I thought was somewhat decent was the spicy one. My boyfriend said that his mixed vegetables reminded him of the frozen kind he buys at the store and heats up in the microwave.  Overall, if you're looking for some barbecue off the strip I would recommend Lucille's or famous Dave's barbecue. I know they are chain restaurants but I've been to Lucille's  at 10 PM at night and their food is still hot, fresh, and delicious.  I don't think we'll go back here & we visit Vegas about once a month..."}
{"text":"Normally I would rave about this place. But then again I've never done take out. I asked over the phone if the sauce for the St. Lois ribs was the same as the regular ribs they sold and was told yes. Well, after driving all the way home I open up the box and I swear I smelled ketchup and Lawry's seasoning salt. The sauce was horrid tasting vs the normal sauce they use for the ribs I've ordered in the past. So a bit of misinformation there.  The sides were TINY compared to what I would have gotten had I ordered in.   That's all I have to say. $25 wasted tonight and I have not the energy nor gas to drive back and replace the order."}
{"text":"I used to love this place in rainbow road when I lived in Las Vegas, that location is closed so we came here.  Complete disappointment, the server seems miserable, and the food is completely different than I remember.    Bread was stale and not fresh and warm like it use to be.    I ordered the grand champion plate.  Granted they open at 11 and I'm dining at 3.  The baby back ribs are dry.  The brisket taste like liquid smoke and dry.  My pull pork is bland like normal but sauce seems runny.  My cream corn has absolutely no corn in it.  It is all cream the Mac and cheese looks like it's been left out for hours.  Smh...  Not a happy camper.   My water and lemonade is the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars!!  This really isn't the best BBQ in town - I am not sure how it got the name \"Championship BBQ\" but it is far from being championship and I honestly tell you, if this guy won Memphis in May, the owner must have thought he won it or is just delusional - there are must better places than this at Memphis in May!!  I honestly think Lucille's is much better than this place, it damm close to real Memphis BBQ. I have had real Memphis BBQ many times and there are places back there that blow this place away out of the water by a 100 miles!! It really should be just called Backyard BBQ. If you really want good BBQ and want to splurge a bit and pay a few more dollars for better BBQ, then go to Lucille's or even Famous Dave's - I even think there are some hole in the wall places on the west like CJs that have better BBQ. Overall - not impressed.."}
{"text":"Fun place. Coleslaw more vinegar-y than sweet. Fine if you like it that way. Don't forget the train whistle when you leave. And get your dessert first!  It's great!"}
{"text":"Mike Mills  In the early 90's, Mike Mills basically owned BBQ competitions.  Currently, he has about 3 locations in Illinois & 2 in Las Vegas.  This particular location was very large, complete with a bar in the middle.  However, it also appears that it has had no upkeep since it was built.  Chairs and walls were missing paint.  Arrived at 11 am and left at noon on Friday.  I was 1 of 5 tables seated and 3 of those tables only had 1 person.  On to the food.  As a competition BBQ judge, I would have judged it as:           Ribs       4 (Appearance)   6 (Taste)  5 (Tenderness)           Brisket   3 (Appearance)   3 (Taste)  2 (Tenderness) We judge from 2-9.  2 being inedible, 6 being average & 9 being excellent.  These numbers would not get you in the top 10 of a competition.  I got 2 meats and two sides for $13.  The baby back ribs were the smallest I have ever seen and way over cooked.  The flavor wasn't bad though.  The brisket was under cooked, and then appeared to be warmed on a flat top prior to giving it to me.  It was dry, you know the kind of dry that you see in Las Vegas, dry.  The greens were ok - actually the best thing I was given.  The slaw was a vinegar based slaw.  It felt to me, that the cabbage had been soaking in vinegar and then pulled out and given to me.   Two BBQ sauces on the table, both good.  A sign on the table helping you to vote them as the best BBQ in Vegas.  I sincerely hope that this is not the best in Vegas...  It would appear that Mike's recipe has been lost and if he doesn't pay attention, his business will be lost too.  Now, since we are in Vegas, care to wager whether or not I hear from any management?  I bet not."}
{"text":"My first and last visit!, Order blacken catfish, greens and bake beans. Never had greens that taste sweet. The bake beans were too sweet and the catfish taste undercook."}
{"text":"So many great choices for lunch... Everyone from the Nellis community loves this place. The food is good and the price is right... Give them a try."}
{"text":"Sweet apple blossom is by far my favorite!   I appreciate the drive thru on the way home from work.  Wish they still had the loyalty program available!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. Had the smoked brisket and baked beans. Nice suave and decent, vinegary slaw on the side. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Our go-to barbeque spot. The burnt ends are amazing, and the honey-infused butter makes the cornbread muffins. The ribs and pork shoulder are pretty tasty as well, especially when you slather it with the sticky red sauce that comes on the table.. Mmm."}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to stop by for quick bite. I didn't want to spend much but wanted to sample the BBQ since I have driven past a few times and been intrigued by the really decorative and eye catching building.   They were very forthright with their lunch special which I appreciate. A lot of places try to hide their specials so that you spend more money. They had a couple of menus on the counter clearly displaying their $6.99 Brown Bag lunch special. You get a choice of pulled pork, pulled chicken, or brisket sandwich with a side and a medium drink. I went with the pulled chicken with baked beans.   The pulled chicken sandwich was very tasty. The bun was soft and felt fresh. The chicken was tender, not dry and had plenty of white meat which I appreciate. The sauce was already on the meat. It was kinda a vinegar based sauce. Possibly some mustard in it based on the light color. I eat a lot of BBQ so I am pretty dead set on the type of sauce I prefer. This one really wasn't for me. Didn't have a really rich flavor like the type of sauce I prefer. Some may love it but I just thought it was OK.   The beans were very good. Had some kidney beans mixed in the thick tomato based sauce the beans were in. Not sweet, more savory. And very tasty.   I've had BBQ in Memphis and I remember it a little differently. But in fairness, to give this place the most accurate rating I would probably need to try their ribs which I assume is their signature.   I say give it a shot- I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I like Memphis!  Not the greatest BBQ but great for a franchise and better than a lot of independent places that people rave about.   I've been to Memphis several times and the meat is always consistent, they uses a dry rub so at least you can taste some flavor.  Sometimes the meat is a bit tough but never nothing that was a huge issue.  Sides are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I came here on co-worker recommendation.  I don't know many legit BBQ places which have drive thru windows which is great for sake of convenience.  I ordered the King AKA  the Pulled Pork Sando Combo.  The Regular size is about 8 oz. of pulled pork smokey deliciousness but when I devoured it  felt like a 12 ouncer.  It came with 2 sides.  I chose the creamed corn and the green beans.  It was the first time I'd eaten creamed corn.  I was good but I prefer creamed spinach but that's not available.  The green beans were bleh and will try some other side next time.   Next trip it will all about the Pork Ribs and Brisket!  This place has to be right up there for Best BBQ in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I got a to go order and the service was good. Two meat option with burnt ends and sausage. Sausage was pretty good. Burnt ends were...not burnt ends. Sides were great. Would of given 4 but they smothered their meat in sauce which to me is them attempting to cover up low quality. I hate that."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that if we could give halves, Memphis would be a solid 4.5 in my book.  But as is, a 4 is a bit more accurate than a 5 for me.  Memphis is one of my all-time favs.  I've been coming here for about 16 years, and I have almost never been disappointed with the food.  The building is rustic and has a comforting apple & hickory smoke scent that gets my mouth watering.  The staff is friendly (if not a bit smaller than when we first started frequenting the place), and service is generally on pace for a BBQ joint.  I've never felt rushed or unattended, and my sweet tea is always full (so I'm always happy).    As for what to try, let me start by saying that I LOVE the baby back rack.  It's a solid portion that comes with two sides, has an even and potent (but not overpowering) smoke flavor layered underneath a dusting of magic (Magic Dust, ha!) and a tangy Memphis-style sauce.  If you're a Texas BBQ fan, this may not be your style.  But give it a chance, and I'm sure you'll be able to dig it, too. :)  Other treats on the menu include BBQ nachos (try them!), fried dill pickles (yum!), the spinach salad & baked potato combo (trust me), hot links, sliders, barbecue burger, king pork sandwich, turkey club, country fried steak, mac and cheese, potato salad, cucumber salad, and--oddly enough--caesar salad.  I haven't had everything on the menu, but these are the items I come back to again and again.  As to what to avoid, I'll just say that that's up to you.  I don't like St. Louis style ribs, so I avoid them.  Same with smoked chicken, the turkey dishes (mostly), etc.  As far as things that I've tried & been disappointed in, the brisket and burnt ends are the only things I've had that, in my opinion, were just \"meh.\"  BBQ is a really personal taste, but if you're even curious about this one, you should check it out.  My money's on you finding at least one thing you really like."}
{"text":"Been waiting a while to try this place. Found 80% off coupon from Restaurant.com to check this place out so we finally did. They have Happy Hour! 2 of my favorite words. *sigh* Good deals - 1/2 off most appetizers and $2 off drinks and some other stuff. Don't remember.  Came her during happy hour both times. Got the ribs, both styles. I guess I am just not a fan of the smokey flavor. But the ribs were pretty dry and not very saucy. The bed of onion strings that the ribs (appetizer) came on were delicious though! At my first visit, we sat at the bar and only ordered the rib appetizers and then a dessert. Nothing special about it. Only good thing was the onion strings.  Second time around, there was a party of 7. Server was pretty good. Got the apple unsweetened tea. Yum. Got lots of onion strings (not as good this time around) and wings! The wings (original) were decent, the other flavors weren't that good. Also had potato skins, decent. And as the main course we had fried catfish with side of mac and cheese and beans. Catfish was not very flavorful but texture was alright. Loved the mac and cheese, but the beans were far too sweet.  Overall experience, meh. Food is not worth the money, but I guess the appetizers at half off are okay for the price, but there's so many other options out there I probably won't go back.. ever."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner w/ the fam.  Service- was great. I forgot our waiter's name but he was awesome. We didn't have to ask for refills, he just came by with another mason jar of our drink. There was 6 of us & he impressed me by memorizing everyone's order. He didn't make any mistakes.   Food-was awesome! Their fresh bread & butter is so good.  I ordered the 2 meat combo. I had the sausage & beef brisket w/ slaw & green beans.  Portions were home cooked country size. Meaning you can make 2 meals out of it.  Their sweet tea is great too.  I always have to order it when I visit.  Bathroom- Dirty!  I walked out and waited til I got to my sister's place.  Made me wonder about the rest of the building.   I love Memphis & went to another location (which was cleaner)  Always one of our visits when we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy the food here but this time was a different story.   We had a craving for a sit down food.  We opted for Memphis and I whole heartedly regretted that decision.  I ordered their Memphis Pasta with Vegetables.  I never had anything as bland as that!  I tried to enjoy it but it just lacked flavor.  I should've just had their Veggie Potato like I was going to order at first.   The service was pretty good but the pasta was really just meh."}
{"text":"Very good food and great prices. The burnt ends are the worst name but the best meat. The sweet potatoes is what I come here to eat. The sweet tea is great and served southern style in a mason jar. The rolls are good but it's the butter that is what people rave about. The service is quick. If you like your drink, you can ask for a to go cup and they'll make you a fresh one for the road. Be sure to tip well for that little extra. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing i come here a lot and everything here is amazing the service is phenomenal... They actually remember faces just like back in the day lol"}
{"text":"This place has really gone down. I remember when the parking lots and the restaurant use to be packed, those days are long gone. Please pay attention to the Yelp reviews (I wish I had ). I had the baby back ribs and smoked turkey with the most awful collards that looked and tasted burnt (the waiter even said most people don't like them - so why do you serve them?). My husband had the chewiest pieces of burnt ends. The best thing was the sweet apple blossom tea and when that's the case just go somewhere else, which is exactly what I'll do next time. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Happy hour specials from 3-6pm. I ordered the chicken and baby back ribs. I found both meats to be quite dry. Sides were over drowned in butter.  Not my preference in BBQ. Service was fast an friendly. Woman's bathroom needs renovating, it's beat to hell and kind of smelled."}
{"text":"We frequent his BBQ joint when we gets the craving for some decent BBQ and have always been satisfied. The service is wonderful as the waiters and waitresses frequent our table and are very nice.  I'll start with the desert first because it is oh so good! We always end our meal with the strawberry shortcake.  Two warm biscuits topped with strawberries and strawberry syrup and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream...oh yea once you have that you'll never have another!  Onto our meal. Hubby had the smoked BBQ chicken with 2 sides (Loaded baked potato and BBQ beans). My son and I shared a full rack of baby back ribs with a side of creamed corn and French fries. The chicken was nicely smoked, juicy and tender. Our ribs were tender and perfectly smoked with the meet falling right off the bones. The creamed corn left me wanting more and the rest of the sides were nothing to complain about.   I'd say we hit the jackpot with this place and can only hope they decide to open another closer to home. We never leave without ringing the bell for great food and service!"}
{"text":"Meh. Im just too used to good bbq in the east and south. Im really not trying to be a snob but the quality lacked, the rolls were nothing special, their sauces were yuck. I had brisket, pork shoulder and st louis ribs. Service was fine and prices were about standard. Its just the food..not good enough for me to return. Nothing smokey about the flavor.   2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I grew up in the south, so I've had my fair share of bbq.  Memphis does a great job at making you feel like you're back in the south.  The food was above average, some things better than others.  My son got a kids meal which was definitely a good value and he seemed to like it.  Wife and I split a plate of chicken and a baby back rib and pulled pork combo.  The chicken was just okay, but the ribs were very good.  This isn't a dripping wet, fall off the bone rib.  It is a super smoked lean rib that has a firm texture and a great taste.  It is not your run of the mill rib, it is very unique and tasty and I can understand why it is their signature award winning menu item.  The pulled pork was very good, flavorful and juicy and definitely on the lean side for pulled pork.  Now for the sides:  mac and cheese is a joke.  do yourself a favor and don't eat it.  tastes like kraft shells and cheese with a stick of butter.  As for the others that we tried, i'd definitely recommend.  The hush puppies were great (so hard to find hush puppies these days, especially good ones).  the fried okra was excellent! (hard to find that too).  The beans were good (famous dave's are much better, but its a different style of beans.  MCB is meatless with more of a ketchup flavor and it grew on me with each bite).   Now for the grand finale:  had the banana pudding for dessert.  If you've got any type of affinity for banana pudding, this may be the best you've had.  I only wish my tongue was long enough to lick the entire jar that it was served in.  Will go back and get this every time.  Try it and you'll love it, I promise!"}
{"text":"I just had to seek out Mike Mills' place on a recent trip to Vegas after reading his book \"Peace, Love & Barbecue\". Mike is royalty among barbecue enthusiasts and you always take a chance when turning your art into a mass-production at several locations. This happy camper can report that his brisket, rib and pulled pork combo tasted as if Mike was personally in the back pulling it out of the pit himself. The bartender who waited on me was one of the friendliest and attentive people I've encountered and that made the experience all the better. Well done, Mike. Now I just need to make it to your original 17th Street Bar & Grill in Murphysboro, Illinois to complete my Magic Dust-induced mission!"}
{"text":"10th year in a row that I've had my Thanksgiving feast catered by MCB, and the food was as tremendous as always.  From the turkeys to all the sides, everything was simply delicious. Leftovers for a week! Thanks to Markini and her staff for always making the process so easy."}
{"text":"Went again because it was my friend's birthday and everyone wanted to go here.... Service still sucked, they brought my food out without my coleslaw  and I didn't notice until the runner left the table and never came back to the table to check on us until they brought the check."}
{"text":"just about average or a bit below average for flavor...was surprised actually...nice staff though...they really need to use a better dry rub to boost the flavor..the sauce was weak...considering there's nothing in the area it beats McDonalds down the street"}
{"text":"My husband brought this home for dinner last night and I have to say that after reading a few of the reviews , my expectation were not that high. We shared some kind of sampler plate, sorry I did not order so I don't know the name, anyhow it had chicken which was pretty good, pulled pork (soft and juicy), brisket(very tender), ribs(yummy), and burnt ends(to die for). All the meats were supper soft and fell apart. The sauce was perfect. We were full but couldn't stop eating. we just moved here from California and live across the street from here. We are definitely becoming regulars."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I got the 2 meat lunch with side okra and cucumber salad. Pork shoulder was dry and burnt ends wasn't anything special. Maybe I just got the wrong things but they had a star next to it so its supposed to be a customer favorite?   I did like the cucumber salad and fried okra. The bread was warm and soft and the butter had a special flavor (honey, I believe). The apple blossom sweet tea is good too. They put the drinks in large mason jars which is cute. If you still have room for something sweet, finish off your meal with the banana pudding. Our server was really attentive and sweet.   I only gave it 3 stars because the entrees didnt impress me. If I do return, Ill try the ribs... but it will be hard to top Phils BBQ in San Diego."}
{"text":"we got a combo plate that came with ribs, pork shoulder, briskets and chicken.  the deal was good...it also came with 2 sides...all this for 22.99.    The problem: everything was dry...the only thing i enjoyed was the beer and the free bread that came with the meal.  they only got 2 stars because the waitress was nice.  my husband is crazy about bbq and he couldnt even eat 30% of this plate...."}
{"text":"CLOSED  Wow, I can't believe this location closed. :( I just recently checked-in here and had a really good breakfast, only offered on Saturday and Sunday. On Monday, Sept. 26th, I received an e-mail saying that this location had closed effective Sept. 25th. The e-mail included a coupon for $5 off my next order at one of their other locations. I doubt I will be using it though. I tend to stay in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good meal except they added the brown sugar mixture to my sweet potato and it had way too much cinnamon in it. A good tip is ask for plain brown sugar and mix it yourself. I liked the Rainbow & Oakey location better when they were open. but overall pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast - which is only served only on weekends at this location on Warm Springs from 8am until 2pm.  Remember the Bob Evan's restaurants from the Midwest?  Well, the breakfast here kinda reminds me of those \"country\" breakfasts.  Lots of good homecooked food.  My new favorite is the Vegas Scramble - eggs, tomato, bacon, cream cheese and avocado.  Sounds strange but amazing combination of flavors!  Served with potatoes and toast (or grits or biscuit) for $8.50. The BF gets the Biscuits & Gravy with Grits (of course) each time we are there....which usually results in a nap shortly thereafter.   He's obviously not originally from this neck o'the woods as his Southern roots show through with his breakfast choice.  But he does tell me that its better than any Waffle House he ever had in the South (which says a lot, apparently).  The bacon and sausage (links or patties) have that great freshly bbq'd taste.  Also, the Bloody Mary's are served in huge mason jar mugs - and are soooo tasty.  Great way to start the day!"}
{"text":"The bbq here is pretty good.  It isn't anything to write home about, but it certainly is worth a stop.  Down sides, it has a very chain feel to it, and there isn't much for a spicy selection."}
{"text":"Amazing pulled pork sammiches and Arnie Palmers. Service is always fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"Good family lunch for my dads birthday. We all enjoyed the fresh warm rolls and honey butter that arrived shortly after ordering drinks. We tried the sweet apple blossom tea 4/5, strawberry lemonade 5/5 - delicious, some sodas and waters. For lunch we decided on the burnt ends appetizer 4/5, the smoked barbecue chicken with sides of baked beans and Mac & cheese 4/5, the two meat combo with baked beans and mashed potato 4/5, the Memphis burger lunch with creamed corn 5/5 and the beef brisket sandwich lunch with green beans 4/5.   The waitress had forgot it was my fathers birthday, after reminding her the brought out a dessert and sang to him.  Overall the meal was good and service was mediocre. Nice place for a BBQ meal with the family."}
{"text":"Boo, this place sucks.  My boss who loved Taco Ole also loved it here.  She ws a nice lady, but I think her taste buds were built from poop sandwiches.  There's not much to elaborate on other than to say that nothing I've ever had from here has been good.  Some of it was close to not edible.  And it's sad because REAL Memphic style BBQ is amazing.  This is a really poor approximation thereof."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today since I live right across from it and honestly don't think I will go back. I tried the sliders, the ribs and chicken fingers. All of them were not very good the sliders tasted old like they had been leftover from a few nights back. The ribs were not very flavorful and were really dry. The chicken fingers tasted like ones that come in TV dinners. They were really soggy. Definitely would not recommend going there."}
{"text":"I want to clarify the last time we were here was in December.  This was one of our all time favorites.  Food and service were always top notch.  We would go here on average 2 times every three months for years.  Well, last time we were there, they had no bbq sauce on the table.  We like a variety of sauces and we mix them together to get the flavor we like.   Well the waiter informed us that they didn't leave them on the table anymore due to people stealing the sauces.  He was very reluctant to leave the sauces at our table for any extended period of time.   It got to the point where we felt like we were begging for BBQ sauce at a BBQ place.  That was just unacceptable to me and we haven't been back since.  I hope this has changed, and we may come back one day if it has.  The ribs weren't very good that trip either."}
{"text":"Definitely the best BBQ I found in Las Vegas. I wouldn't say it is the best BBQ ever though. Growing up in the heartland I know what I love in good BBQ and while the food is delicious, it's not exactly consistent. I have been a handful of times for lunch and ordered similar items, first experience was great but some of the others were just so-so. I recommend Memphis Championship Barbecue if you get a craving while in the area, but if you're not in the mood for BBQ this isn't for you."}
{"text":"Great bbq, best place outside the Vegas strip"}
{"text":"MY favorite BBQ spot in Vegas. Tried this place on a whim , cause I was over at sunset park and in the mood for BBQ. The rolls and butter are amazing but that's just the bread lets get to the good stuff. The portions at this place are massive. My favorite has to be the ribs, Full rack of the baby backs. They don't cheat you on the full rack either, usually have to bring the rest home. The ribs are very soft and almost fall off the bone, the bbQ sauce that's already on them is a little bland. The Real tasty stuff is the STICKY SAUCE, i always smother my ribs in it before i chow down. The magic dust, which is a type of seasoning is pretty tasty as well. The mac and cheese is nice and creamy, the greens and okra are quite good as well. I gladly recommend this place over Dave's , they are similar in price but Memphis has better ribs and bigger portions."}
{"text":"I expected so much more from here.  Everyone was telling me how good this place was so my taste buds were primed for some good BBQ.  I had the \"King\" also known in some circles as \"Memphis Style\"...pulled pork sandwich topped with slaw.      -- The Pork had good flavor, but the sauce (Origional) was just kind of 'meh'     -- They were a little skimpy on the slaw...I think at most there was 1-2 tablespoons of the stuff on my meat  The collard greans were quite tasty so that was a nice bonus, but not enough to give the place another star.   The drinks come out in HUGE mason jars and they give you a to-go cup to take the rest with you."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!!    HORRIBLE!!!!!  HORRIBLE!!!!!   HORRIBLE!!!!!   HORRIBLE!!!!!  The absolute worst \"BBQ\" I have ever tried to eat!!!  If you like tough, chewy jerky be sure to order the baby back ribs!!!  Their BBQ sauce taste like 1 part hot sauce and 5 parts water.  If you like boiled chicken, then order the BBQ chicken because that is what you will get.   You will have a better eating experience if you go to McDonalds and order a kids meal....."}
{"text":"While driving past, I started craving some good tasting BBQ. Turned around and pulled in and looked it up on Yelp.  The reviews were hit or miss but I decided to go for it.  Firstly, there was no smoke smell outside from an on site pit nor the tell tale delicious smell inside.  The atmosphere was very nice and Southern and the staff was welcoming and polite. My friend and I looked over the menu and placed our orders.  While waiting for our deviled eggs appetizers, we reviewed all of the great BBQ places we have been throughout the country.  I know my \"Q\" and even smoke at home.  The eggs arrived and they were good and it was obvious that they had been pre-made and in the fridge for a bit.    The entre's came and I got the two meat and two sides dinner with brisket and pork shoulder with collards and red beans and rice. My friend got the pork shoulder with corn on the cob and collards as well. The corn on the cob was still raw and the collards were way over cooked, too sweet and nearly burned. We replaced both greens with fried okra and they seemed frozen and quick fried with no flavor.  The corn was replaced with hush puppies which were also bland and seemed frozen as well.  Both of our meat choices were near flavorless and watered down. The meat lacked any smoke flavor or smell as well. I must add that our waitress was very helpful and did not bat an eye lash at all of our returns.    The final straw in the Mason jar was when my friend pulled a piece of plastic out of his pork. It was obviously cooked with the pork and it was cooked and shriveled.    The waitress came over to our table and said the whole meal was no charge for all of the items that were not up to snuff.  We left her a hefty tip for being so nice and on the way out we did not wonder why there was'nt any line coming in at 6:00 on a Friday evening.   The one star is for the food and the other star is for the waitress."}
{"text":"$25 for a rack of ribs?  OK! I'll pay that if they are tasty, tender and juicy.  Our bill for 3, came to almost $100 and ribs were dry and tasteless.  Ordered an appetizer of fried pickles and onion straws.  Actually the pickles were good, but not sure what they meant by onion straws.  We had very greasy, limp, onion rings.    What happened Memphis????  You always had some of the best ribs in town! I was soooooo  disappointed!  Won't be back."}
{"text":"I stopped at the Memphis BBQ before flight out of LV airport.  Near the auto-mall.  I sat in the bar area to catch some sports. Very friendly waitress.  Ordered ice tea and Memphis Mini Sliders - pork brisket, chicken, hot link.  The brisket and pulled chicken were dry.  They provide their own BBQ at table but did not help the fact that the pork and chicken were so dry.  I arrived at 12:30 pm so I cannot imagine it was cooking all day to get so dry.  Friendly service!"}
{"text":"I am a notoriously poor Yelp Patron.  I use Yelp almost every day, multiple times per day and I NEVER EVER write reviews.  I've written like maybe 10..?  Well, I am writing a review today for this wonderful BBQ place which I have lived less than half a mile away from for the past year and a half but have avoided trying because of poor Yelp reviews.  I felt compelled to login and post a review because the bad reviews are absolutely undeserved and unfounded as far as I can see.  At least with the food.  I didn't actually eat inside the restaurant - I drove through their window.  The service was fantastic.  The guy who helped me was patient as I perused the menu board and brought my delicious dinner to me very quickly.  I tipped him on the bill even though I drove through.   The food - oh my word.  The food is delicious.  I bought sliders.  One chicken, one pork and one brisket.  DELICIOUS.  Meat is cooked perfectly.  BBQ sauce is fantastically tangy.  The sides were creamed corn and mashed/gravy.  Absolutely perfect.  I've had creamed corn in 5 star restaurants that wasn't as good as this.  I do make my own and it's good but this place gives me a run for my money.  Don't hesitate due to poor reviews.  I really like them a lot and feel bad I've avoided them this long."}
{"text":"Worst Burger I've had in a long time. I ordered med, got well done, cold and cheese was not melted. Never saw a manager and server could not keep up. Never checked to see how our food was. Food took 30 minutes for two sandwiches. My co-workers sandwich was cold as well. This was the latest in a string of disappointments for this place. Only thing keeping the doors open is the army base across the street."}
{"text":"I would only go here if I had a coupon. The prices for their food are somewhat overpriced for what you will be getting on your plate. I could have the same thing at CJ's Texas BBQ for cheaper and it would taste just as yummy. Service was good and the place was empty on a Friday night."}
{"text":"Have eaten here quite a few times.  Food is very inconsistent.  Some days it is great like it used to be four or five years ago when we first starting coming here.  Some days, I can't finish what I ordered because it tastes so poor.  I get The King now pretty much on a regular basis.  That is a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top.  I have the slaw on the side because it is sweet with apple vinegar.  Hush puppies are still good and the beans as well.  The smoked turkey and BBQ chicken can be dried out and tough.  I don't order those any longer.  The onion straws are good but greasy.  We had a great waiter this last time there (last week) but have had the opposite as well.  Used to be one of our regular places but now its a once every six months or so."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best BBQ I have had. I ordered the burnt ends with coleslaw and mac-n-cheese. The bunrt ends almost melt in your mouth and the sauce was amazing! Didnt overpower anything. The coleslaw had an italian dressing flavor to it and, although different than what I have ever had, was extremely tasty! The mac-n-cheese- If you mess up that then it sets the tome for the rest of the meal and it was outstanding! This IS my new BBQ joint to eat at. Thank you folks for an outstanding meal. Our waiter, Stephen, checked on us regularly making certain everything was either topped off or we had everything that we needed and wanted. Be sure to ask for him when you go."}
{"text":"I wasn't all that impressed.  My friend had raved and raved about it and I just wasn't into it.  The best thing that I ordered was the apple blossom tea.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich called \"the King\". It lacked flavor. The pork was very tender.  I was disappointed in their selection of BBQ sauce.  There was one BBQ sauce, a sticky red sauce, and hot sauce.  I was expecting something more like famous daves.  They have a variety of sauces to choose from.  My first side Item was macaroni and cheese.  I normally love macaroni and cheese, but again, this dish lacked flavor.  I really would have like to see a baked mac n cheese coming from a BBQ joint but this stuff was just gross.  My second side item was a cucumber salad.  I enjoyed the flavor on this one, however the cucumbers were SO SOGGY! I don't know about everyone else but I like mine with a crunch.  Not impressed and will not return."}
{"text":"I have lived in Memphis and had true BBQ there ... when i moved to vegas and seen the restaurant figured give it a try.  Not what i expected, food was bland, no taste, undercooked and overall a bad experience. Will wait for next chance to go a real bbq place in memphis."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for a sub-par grilled chicken sandwich, frozen vegetables, and Velveeta mac n' cheese."}
{"text":"After having seen this restaurant on the Food Network and looking at the reviews our family decided to go there when we were visiting Las Vegas earlier this week.  We arrived at 5pm on  Monday August 20th and were greeted and seated right away.  Our server was very attentive and came back several times during the meal to check on us and make sure our drinks were full etc.  So the service was great...the food eh not so great.  We ordered the pick 3 sampler platter with fried pickles (good but a little too salty, smoked wings (fair...definitely had better elsewhere), burnt ends (flavor was good but on the dry side.  We decided to order the family style dinner so that we could try a little of everything.....Pulled pork (dry, flavorless), Brisket (dry, flavorless) Chicken (tender & good), Baby Back Ribs (Great flavor but still on the dry side), Smoke Sausage (super spicy, good flavor but again meat was dry).  Overall the plate of meat was lukewarm at best which would indicate that they did not slice & plate everything at the same time leading items to get cold before they reached the table. The sides, coleslaw (good), creamed corn(excellent), baked beans (super spicy).  We tried 3 of the BBQ sauces and none of them were anything to write home about.  I wished we had ordered individual meals and perhaps the food would have arrived hot & been more moist.  However we probably will never go back as there are too many other restaurants in Vegas so giving second shot to a restaurant is not worth another $100+ bill."}
{"text":"Memphis Barbecue is consistently good.  While there are better places to get barbecue around the valley, if you live or work in the northeast (near Nellis Air Force Base) or southeast part of town (near Warm Springs and Eastern in the Green Valley area), Memphis is a good option when you need to scratch the barbecue itch.  This review focuses on the location on N. Las Vegas Blvd near the intersection of Craig Rd., just outside of the Nellis Air Force Base main gate.  Memphis has all the usual favorites you look for in a barbecue joint:  pork, ribs, sausage, chicken, and a variety of sauces.  Your choice of sauces is limited when compared to other places, but there's something for everyone.  They also have a tasty dry seasoning at the table called \"Magic Dust\", great for sprinkling on just about anything you order.  If you like greens and aren't a purist, sprinkle a little on yours when they come to the table.   Be sure to try the daily soups.  My favorites are the Mississippi Tomato and the Parmesan Potato.  And if you're visiting for the first time, a great lunchtime order is The King (sandwich).  Try it with the cole slaw on the sandwich.  Delicious!  If you're in more of a salad mood but still want some barbecue, the Barbecue Salad won't disappoint.  The salad is basic, but you'll get a respectable pile of pulled pork on top, with your choice of dressings.  The balsamic vinaigrette works well because it doesn't mask the taste of the pork.  Or you can give pass on the dressing and use your choice of barbecue sauce.  All the usual soft drinks are available.  They come in large cups and your waiter or waitress will give you a fresh and full to-go cup if you ask before you leave.  For a pleasant change of pace, be sure to try the Sweet Apple Tea.  If you're on the go, you can call in an order and pick it up at the drive thru window.  It's worth taking a lap around the parking lot first though.  There can be a rather long wait at the drive thru, even when the line appears short.  It may be faster to park and pick your order up inside.  Need consistently good barbecue?  If you're near one of the Memphis locations, grab your friends and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Nice smoke ring on the meat. Yup. Great stuff. Located next to Nellis AFB. Went in at lunch time. Got seated quickly, but took 30 minutes for the food to come. Portions are smaller than I expected. Had the two item lunch menu. Brisket and Burnt Ends. It came with a vinegar based slaw and pop-over. Memphis style. VERY TASTY!"}
{"text":"Normally I'd never eat at a 3 star joint (Yelp is usually on point) but it's close to work and has never been a let down. I'm not sure where all these 1 star reviews are coming from but whatevs. The Burnt ends are really unique and the class of their meat selections imo. I will keep coming back weekly to Memphis."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my birthday dinner at Memphis BBQ tonight and everything tasted great.  My husband and I both had St. Louis ribs.  Took some home for tomorrow.  Sides of salad, veggies, and beans were all very tasty. Great  service as the wait staff works as a team.  We've been going here for 14 years and never anywhere else for bbq.  So much better than Dickey's or Famous Dave's where we only visited once each.  Only Memphis for us.  I love the chicken and the turkey as well."}
{"text":"I love their butter.  So dang good.  The brisket was wonderful! so delicious, moist, and have so much flavor.  I love it how they serve your drinks in a jar.  good service.  would love to come back again. :)"}
{"text":"Yay! I am a fan! I think what I liked most about this place is that since it's not as well known as Famous Dave's or Lucille's there was no wait and it wasn't as crowded. Usually, I would take that as an omen that the food wouldn't be very good, but it definitely satisfied my BBQ cravings.  Fried pickles: ooo you have to order this! It is a must! Little dill pickle chips fried to crispy perfection. The perfect little salty snack to go with your beer before your platter of meat arrives haha.  Meat: Chicken was very tender and falls off the bone. The baby back ribs were flavorful and juicy. My fiance raved about the burnt ends! I guess they take little burnt ends off of the brisket and they cook them again in some sauces and create this new magnificent dish! Gotta try! Hot links: very spicy!   The one con that we had was the pork shoulder was a little dry, but we drenched it in BBQ sauce and it jumped back to life!  Overall, this place is A-OK in my little Black BBQ Book. Oh and P.S. i licked my bowl of baked beans clean... so you can't go wrong with those by your side!"}
{"text":"Memphis Championship Barbecue has perfected the fried okra. Their sauce is nicely balanced and complements the meat well.  The baby back ribs and pork shoulder were great with extra sauce, but alone were slightly dry. Loved the sweet apple tea. Service was great as well.  Overall, a very enjoyable experience. I'll surely return for more Championship Barbecue!"}
{"text":"Food has always been good. But very dirty! Come on! Can we clean up?! Please please clean up. I love this place but damn!"}
{"text":"This place was on my restaurant list! According to Bon Appetit Magazine the best ribs in America are at 17th Street Bar & Grill in BFE small towns in Illinois. However, the owner Mike Mills opened several restaurants in the west coast, Las Vegas to be specific...He names these Memphis Championship Barbeque (though he could not name them 17th Street Bar & Grill because they were not on 17th Street, LOL). NOTE: This is memphis style barbeque so don't expect thick sauces or bones falling out expect some delicious barbeque! Expect pork that been rubbed down with \"magic dust\" and has been slowly smoked forever! The meat is tender and has absorbed all the natural juices of the meat....As I type this my mouth waters! The sides are very good as well! We have amazing service, and babyback ribs to die for!!! If you find yourself in Vegas make sure you stop at Memphis Championship Barbeque!"}
{"text":"My friend and I are serious when it comes to being great food connoisseurs. We both have different backgrounds but when it comes to good food that's where we can agree.  We will drive all over town, even hours out of our way on a trip just for the great slice of pizza or the excellent Fried Chicken. She took me to this place one day excited because she wanted me to experience Memphis Championship Barbecue. I could not believe how great everything was, nor could I believe the size of the sweet tea that came to me.  I have a hankering for some fabu BBQ and WILL throw my food up a wall if it is unsatisfactory because I am THAT temperamental when it comes to food.   The ambiance was very comfortable, the lighting wasn't loud, and the service was exceptional. I got to razz the waiter who took my acerbic humor very well!  Everything from the corn to the biscuits were Nirvana for me and my four cow stomachs.  All of my senses were completely satisfied, and my soul was fattened up for a nap.   This is a must visit stop in Las Vegas if you are a tourist, and if you are not a tourist you should already know this location. I can't tell you what I like the best however the size of the iced tea was worthy of a picture!  REASONS TO VISIT MEMPHIS CHAMPIONSHIP BARBECUE:  1. Comfortable ambience 2. Down home friendly staff 3. Amazing food 4. The size of your drinks!  5. Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"When I saw this listed in the Vegas Yellow Pages, I knew I had to check it out. Nice settings. Very southern right down to your beverages being served in a mason jar ala the Po Folks chain. Rolls were warm but overcooked on the bottom. Sauce wasn't very thick. Almost watery-like. That surprised me for Memphis style BBQ. Then again, what I had wasn't exactly Memphis. I wondered why on the menu they called Pulled Pork 'Pork Shoulder'. Turns out the only thing pulled was the credit card out of my wallet. It's actually chopped pork and not bad chopped pork but that's more Carolina style. So was the slaw since it was in some kind of Vinaigrette. The 'Red Beans and Rice' were really more like Red Bean Soup than anything else. Again, not bad. Just not what I was expecting. Ribs are clearly their specialty and I had to try them. Ribs came wet. I guess if you want it dry you have to ask for it and that is the true Memphis way. First order ribs were chewy and tough and I explained that to the waitress, who was superb. She returned my order of 3 ribs with a totally new order of 4. Which were much better and had a very distinctive smoky taste in it. Easily the best thing on the menu. But it's still frustrating they didn't get it right the first time.  Ribs do come with seasoning insteading giving you a container of 'Magic Dust' instead to coat it with on your table and also to probably see if you'll buy some. Seasoning is good but I've had better.  Overall, a decent place but far from true Memphis BBQ. More like MemCarBQ instead."}
{"text":"Best ribs I've ever had. I don't really like ribs, but the St Louis ribs were great. I also tried the pork rinds, corn muffins, and brisket. The sauce that came with the pork grinds was also very good. The corn muffins were good. The honey butter came with it could have been better (the one at sweet tomatoes is better). Overall, good bbq and decent prices."}
{"text":"Lunch time is extremely busy after 11:30 since this is right by base and military people go on lunch breaks around 11ish, but i came here at 11 and we were seated and our orders were taken right away. I had the buffalo chicken salad... its a little on the spicy side, but it was pretty good! Prices were decent. My salad was 7 bucks, so that was good enough for me, cant complain! friendly waitress, good food, fast services=satisfied customer :)"}
{"text":"Hell YEAH!! What Else do u need to know??? Buy the Magic Dust to use at home. Order whatever you want it all rocks. Cream Corned is the best ever , this is the best of the best for BBQ. in vegas Of course u can technical about the place the service. But for BBQ this good there is no reason to mention anything else. Go there order your food and stuff your pie hole its good. Lates"}
{"text":"Memphis BBQ is a good BBQ restaurant and good for families (as most BBQ restaurants tend to be).  I enjoy their pulled pork, red beans and rice (not an authentic version, more brothy, but good nonetheless) and mac and cheese.  Good lunch option as well with some specials available.  At times, food quality and service are inconsistent, but all-in-all, a good experience.  If you have children, make sure they pull the train whistle at the entry - mine loves this."}
{"text":"Sometimes good sometimes bad. When it's bad, the food tastes old, such as brown lettuce. Inconsistent."}
{"text":"As soon as we arrived, I asked the waitress if the air conditioner was on.  She said this is the best it is going to get.  I asked my wife if she wanted to stay, she said yes.  Big mistake.  When the hot meal arrived and we started to eat, it became very uncomfortable.  I will not return to this restaurant during the summer time since at 5:00 pm there were only two other customers in the restaurant, I cannot imagine what the heat would be like when it started to get busy and more people arrived."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good... After flying in and getting our car, we headed down the road to give this BBQ a shot.  It did not disappoint.  They served us water in jars and the decor was filled with trophies.  We had the 3 item combo comprised of the baby back ribs, beef brisket and pork shoulder with sides of green beans and fries.  This was more than enough for the two of us.  This is the first time I guess I had Memphis style BBQ so the meat was leaner and drier than the BBQ i am used to.  However the meat was very flavorful and had the smoke ring on everything.  What made the meal was their BBQ sauce.  Sweet and smoky with a vinegar tang that complimented the meat rather than smother the meats flavor.  The service was great  and was willing to replace the green beans with boiled veggies when the fiance didn't like that it was cook in bacon.  The price was reasonable as our meal was $20.  I'll be sure to go back again if I am in Vegas craving some BBQ."}
{"text":"Sometimes I say 3 stars, sometimes 4.  MCBBQ is a 4th of July tradition for us (we always get take out and I say that's always a 4).  Dining in though, I feel is more of a 3.  What's a girl to do?  A lot of the time they are out of the dessert I love (hot fudge brownie sundae...they used to make it with peanut butter ice cream, OMG!  But were out of it a lot so I stopped asking).  It seems like the server we had couldn't really handle a large private party.  I'm sure it was slightly annoying that we had separate checks.  I used to be a server, I totally get that, so I tip more when splitting.  But, the \"computer went down\" so I left an hour after I wanted to.  :/    I probably won't be back until the next 4th of July, but I do love those sweet rolls with honey butter!"}
{"text":"Omg! Yumm!! A wonderful, aromatic pairing of  their Apple blossom iced tea with MBQ's amazing food will make anyone's day! This specialized  tea is offered both sweetened and unsweetened for those who are health  conscious like myself.  Now, getting down to the food. I'm shocked to witness the very poorly rated reviews for this restaurant. I've been a long time customer since I moved to the valley from California nearly 13 years ago. Not once  have I been disappointed with the food or service.The ribs are mouth watering and with every bite you have a palate experience of MBQ's savory, tangy-sweet sauce as the meat gently pulls off  the bone and melts in your mouth!  The pulled pork and chicken sandwiches fantastic,the salads gracefully and creatively prepared. They have two items on their dessert menu that I order together and I create my own heavenly dessert. I keep telling them they must  add it to the menu as a specialized item. They need to call it- LEAVE IT TO RHO/A MASTERPIECE!! Lol!  I've introduced it to many a hungry-brood when offering to buy dessert! It's the vanilla wafer pudding and banana dessert and strawberry shortcake. I have them mix both desserts in the kitchen and then it's served in this trough-like bowl with loads of whipped cream! Feeds a whole table of 8!! Omg, so amazing! Only on my special splurge day of the month will I indulge in this most decadent creation! There is a vast array of food to select from that will satisfy anyone whether dieting or splurging!! Warm Springs location ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"This place is a rock solid 3 stars for me. The food was good, nothing amazing but definitely not terrible.  We arrived, and were seated quickly. Our server was fantastic. She was funny, and fun, and happy to help with any questions.  We ordered a bunch of apps, since we were a small gaggle of hungry boys. Honestly, I think I like them apps better than my meal. We ordered the fried pickles, pork rinds, and deviled eggs. All great. The pickles were the hit of the table.  For dinner, I had Beef Brisket and it was tender, good flavor.  Would I rush back, probably not. There are definitely better BBQ places around town! But.....Would I go if invited, sure."}
{"text":"The convenience of the drive thru is almost nonexistent at this MCB location. I came here with my husband and pulled up to the order window. We were greeted and asked how we were doing.  It was a 2 way conversation that seemed to be perfectly normal. However, we were all of the sudden told that the speaker was broken and we needed to pull up to the window to place our order.  We drove up and there was another car at the window so we had to wait. And wait. And wait. And wait some more. After waiting about 15 minutes the car in front of us got their food and drove away. We came to the window and placed our order, paid (even gave a 10% tip although in hindsight, that was a ridiculous thing to have done) and waited. We'd ordered 2 sodas and thought for sure that they would be given to us immediately (and even had a hunch, albeit an incorrect one, that we may get the drinks for free on account of the incredibly long wait due to the \"broken\" speaker). After waiting another 20 minutes (we're now up to a 35 minute wait), we were given our food. I asked if there were rolls in any of the bags and she said, \"No.\" I asked her if we could have some (they come with a meal inside, why do I have to ask for them in the drive thru?). She came back with them, said thank you and started to close the window. I stopped her and reminded her that she had forgotten our drinks. She politely apologized and got us our drinks.  After getting home and unpacking our dinner, I was nothing short of pissed to discover that the sour cream, tomatoes, green onions and jalapeños for my nachos were nowhere to be found. What's the point of nachos without these?  I angrily called the restaurant and the manager was apologetic and offered to put my name on a comp list for a free nachos on my next visit. I appreciate them rectifying the situation but am disappointed that the entire experience was such a bust in the first place. The broken speaker made the amount of time we had to wait virtually the same amount had we gone inside to eat. I realize it's not fast food but 35 minutes plus forgotten items is unacceptable.  I love Memphis Bar-b-que for the food but to me, good food only goes so far. The food is what brings me there, the service is what keeps me coming back. On this night, it was a failure all around."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ tasty stuff , family friendly and good prices for a good sized meal. The beans are excellent and so is the drink in a mason jar - a nice homespun touch that compliments the decor.  Weekend breakfast is super."}
{"text":"Been a fan of this place for years. The sweet tea, one of the best in town. The King sandwich, a classic delicious pulled pork that I personally prefer with their spicy BBQ and vinegar based coleslaw ON the sandwich. Another good item is the blackened catfish. Favorite sides, creamed corn, potato salad, and the red beans and rice. The lost a star because they have more than once been out of certain items. (Hot links/ sides)  Convenient for sure, they have a drive thru with the option of calling in your order ahead of time. Or sit down and they'll serve you as well.  Don't forget to grab a bottle of their magic dust seasoning on your way out!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. The ribs are the highlight. We Got a sampler platter with beef tips chicken wings ribs and fried pickles. The service was pleasant and prompt. We even bought some of their magic dust seasoning to go."}
{"text":"Fried pickles? Seriously??   \"Yep...we're sharing an order...you're going to love them.\"  This from my co-workers in our Las Vegas office. Commuting to Las Vegas three times a week for eight years was a grind. Memphis made it tolerable.  I reluctantly ate the fried pickles, dipping them into some kind of weird pink sauce. Fuck it, when in Rome, right?  I ate everything on the menu in those eight years. I even ate things not on the menu.  Like my own tongue, biting into the sneaky little fucker as it pretended it was the pulled pork. A regular occurrence here.  I hate using clches, so I'll simply say the brisket isn't to die for, but is worth sustaining a serious life-threatening injury...like maybe a gunshot wound or something.   It's just that good."}
{"text":"Great food prices for lunch. I had the 6.99 lunch special with ice tea and added an additional side for $1. The okra was freshly made and the BBQ was amazing. The potato salad was average but still tasted good."}
{"text":"Food was great!!! I got the baby back ribs  and it was wonderful! The fried pickles were on the salty side but not greasy. Our server was on his game!!! I will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always awesome..however, the last three times we have been here including today the service was absolutely awful! We got our food before our drinks...the meal was an hour and a half and most of it was waiting on the waitress to bring drinks food etc...a shame really"}
{"text":"I have had their Brisket on several occasions, pretty good stuff, I am a BBQ fanatic, if I like it, you may love it, I have tried BBQ from some of the best cooks in the world... that being said, this stuff is pretty damn good... try it for yourself"}
{"text":"Our office went here for lunch & had appetizers, entrees, ice teas & desserts.  1/2 of the contingent loved everything & the others thought it had gone down in quality since they had last been there.  All agreed the Magic Dust improved all."}
{"text":"Not as good as used to be.  We took out of town visitors there.  I had brisket.  Kind of tough and dry.  Sauce seemed boring.  Service not very good considering the place was really empty on a Wednesday night.  Prices much higher than say Tony Roma's or Lucille's.  Would only go back if I had a 50% off coupon."}
{"text":"I personally love this place. Big portions and large tables with lots of room for big groups.  Great service and refills came often. Food comes out fast and warm.  Note: the sides are refillable on the large meals so never order 2 of something.   I'll be back.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you are from anywhere in the US that prides itself on BBQ, then you know when you eat here, it's just plain awful  Dry, tough to eat.  I was in town for business and this was catered in.  Had eaten this stuff before and already knew it was not going to be good. BUT the sides were good (though lima beans in bbq beans mixture, i think not, just strange).  The banana pudding was good though."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was amazing for the price. Close to base which is great for a quick lunch. I had the king which was delicious and topped it off with an apple sweet tea! Nice selection of meals!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for more than 20 years. The ribs and sauce tasted the same as they did back in my high school days. They used to have a snazzy rice pilaf about 15 years ago that was excellent, don't know what they never brought that side back. The pickle chips are also really good. I like this place because it isn't like a 'neighborhood grill/bar',The place has a definite theme and flair about it, but make no mistake: you are here for the barbecue. No matter where I am in Vegas visiting, I ALWAYS make it a point to stop and have a rack of ribs here. Consistency and quality over a 20 year period equals the best ribs and sauce."}
{"text":"Went to the Warm Springs location for my birthday (5 yr in a row) was surprised with new menu.... got our dinners and was sadly disappointed sides were over cooked and over seasoned . The \"brisket\" was cut into small strips like french fries . They got the wrong ribs for my plate and the burnt ends were fatty and not good at all. We have been fiercely loyal for 6 yrs but sad to say today was our last visit and we will not be recommending Memphis to anyone. Everytime we had guests come into town this is the place we always took them too but no longer it has become a place not to go. So sad I feel like we lost a friend today.   PS. I heard they got a new manager and she isnt up to snuff .. really poor dining experience. Wait staff tried but you can feel how disgruntled they are and have had to deal with irate customers. I feel sorry for them."}
{"text":"First off, our server Shawn was top notch.  Very knowledgeable and patient  and made some excellent recommendations. Now on to the food. Since we aren't actually in the south any more it is very difficult to find good and true BBQ. Memphis comes the closest out here. The pulled pork was very good but to be honest it is most certainly boiled. It still has a decent flavor though so don't pet the scare you away in the least. The coleslaw is very vinegary.  All in all it was a pleasant dining experience. Request to be seated in Shawn's area if possible. Have fun y'all."}
{"text":"Things I liked. Air conditioning, tea, bread and butter, chicken.   Things I didn't like, all other meat.   Reason: guess I'm not used to this style of BBQ, being raised in Iowa and all."}
{"text":"after living down the street for 2 years from this joint we finally got up the nerve to try it out! lol It was on a sunday evening and my husband wanted to make sure that he could watch football and sure enough they had 3 tvs in the bar area so he was happy. We wanted to try a varitey of things so we opted for: a pick 3 appetizer with 2 order of smoked wings and skins and grand champion platter dessert of apple pie and pecan pie our waitress was amazing we had lots of questions and asked for recommendations and she was happy to help out.  appetizer was amazing the wings were perfect nice and smokey with a tangy bbq sauce. skins were crispy and filled with pulled pork topped with cheese and scallions. the dipping sauces were also good.  The grand champion platter was definatly big enough to share it came with burnt ends, smoked chicken leg quarter, beef brisket, shredded pork shoulder and st. louis ribs. also accompanied by 2 sides. we asked for mac and cheese and red beans and rice. i love coleslaw so added an additional side for 2.49$ everything was smokey tangy bbq goodness no complaints on any of the meats except we wanted more!!   we took dessert home but our waitress was so nice and gave us our al a mode there so it wouldnt be melted!   we will def be back a lot of more times lololol  ps i also had sweet tea and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"Amazing......potato skins: cheddar cheese green onions and pulled pork!!! Omg!!! Their sauce is the best get the spicy!!! We will definately be making return trips. The service was great, the waiters are attentive and knowlegdable about the menu. Definately a place to share huge portions are servced"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because my most recent visit has been very unpleasant. I drove by the drive through right before 9pm last night. I sat in my car and waited for the cashier to take my order and I got no response. When I drove up to the window the girl working the drive through told me they closed at 9 although the sign and yelp said 9:30. Then tonight I gave them another try. I ordered the specialty combo the bbq salad, chili, corn muffins and a large sweet apple blossom tea. I repeated my order twice and she still got it wrong. I told the girl no sauce and beef not pork. When I got my food she forgot to give me my drink and when I drove off something told me to double check my bag. They gave me pork not beef it was smothered in sauce after I told her no sauce and the tea was not sweet at all. I went back to the window so they can fix my order and the girl was helpful although when she walked away to get me beef with no sauce I could her her complaining and the tea she bought back was not sweet at all. I low key did not want to drink it cause I was afraid maybe someone spit in it. I don't think I'll ever come back. Sucks cause I use to love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious food, huge portions, awesome service. Does it get any better than that? I definitely recommend this place for some good old fashioned bbq..the pulled pork sliders are really good. They make their own special sauces that are very tasty and flavorful, too."}
{"text":"I was really craving some BBQ today, and this place popped up on my search. Walking in the front door I realized I had made a good decision. I was on the early side of the dinner hour and got a table right away. Service was excellent and my dinner came quickly- but not before three of their delicious rolls with honey butter  somehow disappeared...  I ordered the 2 meat combo plate with Memphis ribs and burnt ends they were both excellent and so were the side dishes. I only regret eating a wonderful meal and not having enough room in my stomach for dessert. I'll have to come back and try some of their desserts on my next visit."}
{"text":"Well the food was OK at best.  Middle of the road BBQ is giving it to much credit.  I'm not a famous Dave fan but its better. Man I miss Missouri."}
{"text":"Decided to get takeout for lunch today and it was great.  I eat an early lunch and they don't open until 11:00am, but I called them the day before and they said if I called at 10:30 the would be happy to make my lunch a little early and I could pick it up at 11:00.   It was very convenient because they have a drive-thru and my food was ready when I got there.  Pulled pork sandwich:  This was the real deal.  I've been to Memphis in May and had some really good pulled pork and they live up to their name.  The bun it was served on was just average, but the pork was tops.  It is served naked on the bun but they give you a small side of slaw and barbeque sauce.  The barbeques sauce was decent.  Cole Slaw - In addition to the small slaw I had ordered slaw as one of my two sides.  And I'm glad I did - the slaw was great.  It's not a mayo based slaw but a red wine vinegar base and it was delish.  Baked beans - I got the beans and it they were pretty good.  A little sweet for my taste, but I like that they used a couple different types of beans.  Ice Tea - On their website they advertise a \"Memphis House Blend Ice Tea\" sweetened or unsweetened.  I ordered sweetened on their recommendation and immediately wished I hadn't.  Not that it was too sweet - it wasn't - but I just prefer the bitterness of unsweetened in general.  The sweetened version I found to be so-so nothing mind blowing.  Sandwich, two sides, and iced tea for under $10.  Not a great deal but not bad.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I'm from the deep South, so I was really excited when my boyfriend suggested this place as I was hoping to find a real hidden gem for great BBQ in Vegas. When we walked in, I was convinced all my BBQ prayers were soon to be answered. The place looks legit, and they serve sweet tea (awesome) in mason jars (bonus). I excitedly ordered pulled chicken with macaroni and cheese and collard greens. The food came out quickly, and the first thing that caught my eye was the nearly black collard greens... Apparently they are seasoned with molasses, which is bizarre to me but wasn't totally unpleasant. The mac and cheese was nothing to write home about, and the pulled chicken was mediocre at best, super salty and a bit soggy at worst. My boyfriend ordered a slider trio and said the brisket was the best, followed by the pulled pork, with the chicken taking a distant third. The Sticky Red Sauce is great, the honey butter is yummy, and the Magic Dust is also really tasty though it packs a salty kick. Overall, an underwhelming food experience though our server was attentive, accommodating, and friendly (and the sweet tea was awesome). Will we be back? Maybe, but probably not. Still searching for decent comfort food in Sin City that doesn't come out of my own kitchen..."}
{"text":"Every time I make a Vegas trip I hit up this place on the way out. This is so far the closest thing in BBQ away from Memphis. I have only ordered the baby backs, but I am confident that the rest is just as good. Slow cooked, smokey, and fall off the bone goodness.  Don't forget to take some Apple Ice Tea to go!"}
{"text":"I could write a scathing rant about the lack of good BBQ in Sin City. I could also write about how shitty some of the meats at MCBBQ were. But instead I'll point out the good things I tried and worth coming back for. (avoid the pulled pork and brisket btw)  The Deviled Eggs tasted just like my mothers, this is a very good thing. St. Louis ribs were awesome! Great smokey flavor and pull off the bone tender. Last thing I really liked about this place was the friendly outgoing service.  They do have a drive thru which is pretty awesome and convenient."}
{"text":"Memphis Championship BBQ, what can I say!!! It is a hidden gem!!! I found this place on the first night I moved to vegas last year. It is a fun, funky joint. It is a sit down restaurant as well as a drive thru (bonus if you are craving it and have no one to go with). When you walk it, it usually isn't crowded, but don't let that scare you.   Food - You definitely have to order the BURNT ENDS! They are delicious and some of the best BBQ I have had! The mac n Cheese is creamy and to die for, and I consider myself a mac n cheese expert. I have tried the brisket too, but it can be hit or miss. Sometimes it can be a little fatty, but if you get it on a good day, you will be impressed.   Drinks - Definitely order the sweet tea. It tastes like it is straight from the South.   There is also a train whistle at the entrance - DONT FORGET TO RING IT!"}
{"text":"Ordered to-go from bitesquad app. Food was good but, if you are picky about your bbq sauce. This may not be the place for you. Their customer service is great. I had a minor mishap with mine pull chicken sandwich. So i called and they didn't take long to tell me they'll put my name and number down for reimbursement."}
{"text":"I was craving ribs and fortunately, my gf was nearby Memphis \"championship\" BBQ. Note that we been here before and loved the food. so tonight we ordered whole BBQ chicken and full slab of babyback ribs. Ordered 2 Mac n cheeses, fries n hush puppies. Instead they replaced 1 Mac w BBQ beans normally I wouldn't mind but it had an off put taste. I didn't eat it. Mac was like albertsons bought n hush puppies were burnt outside n not cooked thoroughly.   Now the ribs n chicken. Chicken was dry n bland. Ribs were tough, bland, weird color and no BBQ or smoke flavor at all. I doubt that it ever was smoked. Seem like it was either boiled or baked then heat up on the grill when ordered. I'll even put up a $1 it's probably microwaved. We are very disappointed. Leftovers gone straight to trash! Waste of money."}
{"text":"Perhaps if I hadn't grown up in the south, I would be able to rate this place better. The food was fine, the service was fine, but I'm spoiled. I've had some awesome barbecue in my day, and this just doesn't compare.. The fried pickles are a little off, and the pulled pork and brisket, while nice and moist, just didn't really taste like REAL smoked barbecue. And what kind of southern barbecue place doesn't have brunswick stew and cornbread?  Honestly, this place is ok, and I'll probably return at some point. But it could be SO much better."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. Barbecue is my absolute favorite food in the world. I was raised on it. This place has minimal flavor."}
{"text":"Our church media team was in town for the NAB Show 2018 and after the first day, we met up here to enjoy a meal together.  They had a special going on where all their appetizers were 50% off until about 6pm which meant we had about 15 minutes to put in our orders if we wanted to make the deadline. Most of us decided it made sense to order appetizers instead of an entree so that's what I did.  I ordered a plate called Burnt Ends which were twice smoked beef brisket nuggets which were then basted in a combination of barbecue sauces. This was definitely a winner in my book in taste. The menu price was $8.99 so 50% off was a great deal! I also ordered the Buffalo Chicken Fingers which are breaded chicken breast fillets tossed in a Buffalo wing sauce and served with ranch dressing. This was good too, not as great as the brisket as I thought it needed more barbecue sauce on it. The menu price for this was $7.99. I also ordered a basket of the Corn Muffins for $2.99. So you can see, I was able to get a great savings on what would have normally cost me $20 and more.  The waitress was a sweetheart and although she had a huge task of trying to keep all our orders straight as well as give us separate checks at the end of our meal, I felt she accomplished her job well albeit with a few check errors but otherwise we were all well-taken care of during the meal.  I would venture to say given the fact that most of us are meat lovers in our group we would probably be back again if in town."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place - although you should know my only comparisons are located in other states.    Ribs are the BEST.  Chicken is ok, but not my fave. Sides are ok - nothing spectacular, nothing awful.   The ribs are so good that it doesn't matter if the chicken and sides are just ok, this place still rocks.  And they serve sweet tea.  Yum.  And a drive-through!!!  Amazing."}
{"text":"This place has either gone through  new management or they lost LA really good cook or both . Anyways I've been here a few times and those times I've been here have been great . This time though the ribs where dried out . The mashed potatoes  graveyard tasted like it came out of a package . The only thing that was good was of course  the Memphis wings and the burnt ends . I'm very disappointed  and will not be coming back . On a plus side your server Pat was awesome he did a great job . But the food was horrible  and I'll be taking  my business  elsewhere."}
{"text":"After an absence from what was a favorite restaurant of mine, I decided to go back and give it a try tonight. First, the restaurant was pretty much empty, but with that said, we still waited for a long time to have our order taken. We ordered baby back ribs, but I don't think that is what we got. Everyone mosied around the restaurant with no energy or enthusiasm whatsoever. What would have happened if they had been full? I have been going to Memphis Barbecue for many years and it is no longer the same place. Since they remodeled, it seems like the place is failing. Please, someone take notice of this great restaurant before it is too late."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The fried pickles were SO SALTY. Not even \"salty\" BUT I WAS LITERALLY CHEWING ON rocks of salt. It would have been good without all of that salt. Pork rinds tasted like store bought rinds. Nothing special. Ribs are super dry and stringy. It felt like I was eating sticks. The ribs at Claim Jumper is better than this, which is so embarrassing for this restaurant since it has BARBECUE In its name. You know what the highlight of my meal was? The bread and butter my meal came with. That's how sad it is. NEXT!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Always stop by before leaving for San Bernardino.. Great food. Great service.."}
{"text":"Just ate the southern fried cat fish sandwich and it was very delicious, for being a lunch sandwich it was pretty big and filled me up good. I also had a side of mac and cheese that was very good. I ordered a pick up order and as soon as I pulled up to the window it was already ready. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here since I was first stationed here in 1995. Service has declined; a lot. The drive thru is horribly slow ALL THE TIME. They seem understaffed. The food is good. Seemed to have slipped in quality from back then a tad."}
{"text":"Warning - this food caused vomiting and back end explosions after eating.  Ordered some BBQ for take out last night. This morning, all three of us in the house are sick as hell.  The food was well below average, I've microwaved pulled pork from the Costco freezer section that tasted better and had more flavor. Sweet Potatoes were good but only because of the massive amount of cinnamon and butter - the potatoes itself was way overcooked and mushy like baby food.  Daughter ordered the brisket plate. It was \"ok\". Very dry and tasteless. Pretty sure it was actual beef, just not quality beef. Lucky for her getting sick from it means she got to taste it twice. Both times were horrible to her. She ordered a chili which of course never made it in to the bag so I'll have to guess and say its equally horrible.  Wife ordered the burnt ends dinner - was mostly big chunks of solid fat any chunks of actual meat found tasted like it had been sitting on the counter for 2 days before being served to us. The coleslaw? WTF? This tasted like no coleslaw I've ever eaten in my life. It was basically old cabbage chopped up and tossed in vinegar. Not very appetizing so it was thrown out after one bite.  I ordered the potato skins and the sliders. Meh, skins were ok, kind of greasy but thats to be expected when you pile pork and cheese on a potato . Sliders were dry, nothing but bun, meat, and some poor excuse for a BBQ sauce. Literally tasteless and dry. Sadly not equally tasteless while leaving my system.  I'd write more but I am off to my fourth trip to the restroom to let the garbage we were served last night continue to evacuate my system.  In Vegas at 4AM you are not supposed to be hugging your toilet, you are supposed to be out having fun. Ugh NEVER AGAIN.  There are enough good BBQ places in Vegas near me that I'll never try this place again."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch yesterday and Tracy my server was amazing! She was funny and so attentive. I had the pulled chicken with coleslaw and fries. The spicy BBQ sauce and red sticky sauce were freaking phenomenal. The chicken was so juicy and so good! I live right up the street so this will be my new go to for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"i love the beans at this place.  they also have to-go food, which is great.  although, i always end up eating more than i should!"}
{"text":"I love to be able to be giving so many 5 start ratings. This place takes the cake! You will not be disappointed if you take the short hike over to warm springs. If you are renting a car is Las Vegas you are already just down the street from it! The King sandwich is the best!"}
{"text":"Years ago I was a fan of this restaurant. Last night we took visiting friends there. So disappointing! Waiter took forever to come to the table. He took our drink order and 20 min later arrived with a warm pitcher of beer. He spilled some of our martini on the table. Pointed to the paper towels for us to clean up the mess. We asked if we could give him our food order then, he refused. When he did return again, he seemed annoyed.  He returned once, asked if we wanted water. He returned with 2 waters, not 5. When we asked for to go boxes, he threw them in the middle of the table. Tried to give him the benefit of the doubt - maybe short of help?? Regardless, you don't take it out on the people you expect a tip from! Did I leave a tip, no way! So if you go to this location and \"Brandon\" is your waiter...LEAVE."}
{"text":"Ok let's start out by saying that this is a BBQ JOINT...there are not a lot, if any healthy options here...thank the Lord. If you want healthy...go somewhere else.   We came here for father's day and were in the mood to grub on some meat (the west wasn't won on salad...just sayin). Steven was our server and was very sweet, attentive and my little girl thought he was the bees knees.   We ordered quickly because we were starving and the attention span of a 3 and 2 year old is a bit much to be desired.   -The burnt end appetizer was so yummy. Bits of brisket that were crispy and soft at the same time over a piece of white bread with their original BBQ sauce. Definitely recommend you start out with this.   - Kids Mac and Cheese...the kids liked it...and that's all that matters :)  - We each got a two meat combo...both with beef brisket, he got hot links and I got pork shoulder. I am not much of a sausage fan (hehehe...my dirty mind is kicking in) but it was pretty good. The pork was soft and shredded. Very flavorful but not healthy in the least (please refer to the top of this review). The beef brisket was yummy but it could have stood to have a bit more marbling (I am used to Texas brisket). Still very good.   - The creamed corn is amazing...sweet, salty and creamy. A must have for the sides.   - The mint chocolate chip brownie was very good...not earth shattering (this isn't Max Brenner when it comes to desserts) but definitely worth it if you have the room (the kids faces were covered in hot fudge).   Overall a great time with my family. The prices aren't super cheap but the portions are good and the service is wonderful. Thank you Steven for a great time and we will be back to visit you for the country breakfast that you had mentioned."}
{"text":"It was my first time dining here. I read that the hamburgers are very good so I thought I'd try one. I ordered the Memphis burger and it was delicious. My choice of two sides were fries and steamed vegetables, and they were both excellent."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Delicious food and lots of choices.  Friendly staff.  This is the second time I have been there.  The first time we paid $40 for a taxi to drive us from the Luxor to pick up take out.  Needless to say, this time we drove ourselves on our way back to LA.  I ordered a catfish sandwich.  The flavor was great especially paired with tartar sauce and it was on a really soft bun.  For sides, I ordered mac and cheese which was light and creamy and hush puppies.  To drink, sweet iced tea which comes in a huge glass.  My boyfriend ordered a pulled pork sandwich, hush puppies, fried okra.  He loved it.  I highly recommend the fried pickles!  We bought a refillable 1 gallon jug full of their delicous sweet tea and a bottle of Championship BBQ Sauce.  I can't wait to use it!  I'm taking the jug in for a refill next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth 1 star. I was so disappointed then never before. I can't believe what food was served to my whole family. Everything was old and already made ahead. My meat was so dry, no way to eat that. Don't go there, you get sick. After I had a couple bites, we left this place and my husband and me got sick."}
{"text":"I'm really not big on big chain restaurants but it has been years since I have eaten at this Memphis BBQ. I can't say much about the last tie I ate there but there must have been a reason.  When ordering, I told the waitress that the last time I came was disappointing and I was excited to try again, years later. As you can tell from the five stars, this a trip was much better. I ordered a three meat combo with hot links, brisket, and burnt ends. The sides were baked beans and framed corn. My wife had the chicken fried chicken smothered in country gravy with a baked sweet potato and baked beans.  As we waited for our food, the waitress brought us some rolls with honey butter and let us know that the chicken was made from scratch and it took a few extra minutes to make sure it was cooked thoroughly.  When our food came, it looked and smelled great. I am always a little concerned about ordering burnt ends as man times it comes tough and dry. These burnt ends were perfect. Full of flavor and tender with just a touch of fat. The hot links were tender and not over cooked with just the right amount of spice and the brisket was tender and juicy. The baked beans at Memphis are always great. Just the right amount of sweet and the beans are tender without being mushy. Many places try to make creamed corn and many places are unsuccessful. My creamed corn was perfect. Again, just the right amount of sweet and the texture of the corn was great. My wife's chicken was juicy and perfectly fried with a flavorful country gravy. Her sweet potato was covered in all the fattening toppings and very tender. We both took boxes of food home and look forward to the leftovers. I have learned over the years, that leftovers should be taken home for two reasons only. One, if you have a dog and two if you plan on eating them. I rarely take leftovers home but there was no way I was leaving this food. Wether Memphis BBQ got a new cook, a new staff, or just made a few changes, it works so keep it up. I have become very hard t please when it come the food and I was truly pleased with this dining experience. Great dinner Memphis BBQ. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"****AVOID**** RIPOFF ALERT****   ****AVOID***** RIPOFF ALERT****  Went there for lunch with a co-worker.  Waited over 1/2 hr to be served.  The service was the slowest ever.  The place was not busy.  The waiter, Shawn, did not really care.  We got the food and it was moderate at best.   Here is the RIPOFF part.  When we got the bill we were charged $15.99 dinner price for the 2 meat meal.  It should have been $9.99 + $1 for the extra side, making it $10.99.  I explained to the waiter that were charged the wrong price, but he explained that the price would be the same so he charged us the dinner price?!?!?!?    I didn't understand, so he said he would get the menu and come to explain.  He NEVER came back.  It was 1 hr. 1/2 into our lunch time at that time and we had to go.  I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN.  The food being mediocre at best, but the service and the fact that the Shawn, the waiter, lied and charged us more for our meal is unacceptable.  There are a lot better BBQ places here in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I must have hit this place on an off night because the ribs I had were some of the worst I've ever eaten. They were dry as a bone and the meat was tough as leather. That rack must have been cooked and sitting out for quite some time. The sides were decent and the service was solid but I don't know if I'd ever go back. Next time I'm craving some good BBQ I'll have to head out to Lucille's in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! The mason jars as drink cups is a nice touch. The food is good, and the staff are friendly enough"}
{"text":"So so food. We had the pork sandwiches.  Aparently there is only one size even though the drive through menu clearly lists small and large. .... The pepsi tasted like ass.  The service was good and bad.  We recieved out food quickley, but the gal working had a hum drum attitude.  Im fairly sure I was over charged by 5 or 6 bucks, but as I was given no receipt that is just a guess. I guess I would probably return if staying on this side of town again."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably four or five times in the last few years. I decided to finally write a review.  Tonight's dinner was excellent! Our server approached us right away, bringing us starving (hey, we'd skipped lunch!) guests bread and asking what we wanted for drinks. We ordered our drinks and appetizer right away - you know, because we were hungry! Wine was brought promptly to the table, as were our appetizer and entrees. Our server told us our entrees would be done quickly and asked if we preferred to wait or if we wanted them quickly. We really appreciated that he would ask how we preferred our food to come out. Of course, we were starving. We wanted it all. We wanted it now :-) Everything was absolutely delicious, except for one exception. And, this is just a taste preference. I don't care for the coleslaw. Other than that, everything was great.  We both got the Burnt Ends. Yum, yum, yum!!! Service was absolutely excellent."}
{"text":"Super-friendly, super-friendly nice staff, but bbq was just so-so. Dry for the most part. The best part of our meal were the fried pickles and the sweet tea. Went here on the recommendation of someone we had met but did not know their taste in restaurants, thought we'd give it a try, but it was just disappointing. Perhaps, back in the day, their championship awards meant something, but I would just skip this one if you are a true bbq lover."}
{"text":"One of the lousiest meals I've had in a while. Choices are extremely limited near base, so I can see how this place gets away with being so bad. Poor service and overcooked bland food. You can cover up sub-par pulled pork with some good sauce, but even their sauce is terrible!"}
{"text":"Tasty grub as usual. The deviled eggs are a great app and the hot link was nice and spicy."}
{"text":"Okay, so my sister-in-law and her husband were in town and were craving a little bbq...  I made the mistake of thinking this place was \"Memphis BBQ\", like from \"Down Home with the Neeleys\".  OOPS.  Definitely not.  By the time we realized it, it was sort of too late to leave, and everyone was starving so we gave it a shot.  We started with the sampler app platter.  Biggest pile of fried stuff I'd ever seen.  I'm pretty sure they just threw the onion strings and pickles in the fryer at the same time, then poured them on the potato skins, so everything had a interesting fried, bacon, sour cream flavor.  Highlight was the wings, which were NOT fried...  tender, not oversauced, generally above-average.  The ribs (both baby back and St. Louis) were mediocre at best.  WAY over-smoked, sort of overcooked.  My husband said they tasted like kielbasa.  I don't think anyone at the table disagreed.  The funny thing is, you get your choice of sides...  My husband and I got steamed veggies (you have to save calories somewhere), and, it turns out, the portions of the \"good-for-you\" stuff are like half of the other stuff (creamed corn, mac and cheese, baked beans, fries).  This place is a definite \"not recommend\"."}
{"text":"Go to another BBQ place. Food isn't that good, they forget items through the drive thru and customer service sucks. Plus the drive thru is a 15 min wait so please don't be in a rush !"}
{"text":"It is rare when I send food back, but the food here was so unacceptable that I couldn't sit by idly.  I ordered the tri tip plate, which came with my choice of 2 sides.  The tri tip was extremely dry, like they'd either sliced it before they grilled it or had reheated it.  The macaroni and cheese was straight out of a box, and we're talking the Kraft kind with that fake sickly orange powder.  Unbelievable, this was a mid-range BBQ place and they were serving starving college student mac 'n cheese?!  I thought to myself, how could you screw up steamed vegetables?  Try covering it with melted butter.    The waitress was very nice and offered an alternate item or removing the plate from the bill.  I took the later as I had no confidence in the quality of their food."}
{"text":"Great catfish entree and huge! We went on a saturday late afternoon for lunch and i was really shocked that we were of maybe 8 other tables in there dining however as we were finishing up the restaurant began to fill up a bit. I pass it everyday on my way home and the parking lot does look full during the 6pm hour.   Staff is really lovely and they check in with you the right amount of times. They always checked on our water and drinks or if we need condiments with our meal.   Food wise I recommend the breaded catfish entree which comes with two sides and a corn bread muffin. It's a really large portion so go hungry! The fried pickles are also very sinful as is the dipping sauce that comes with them."}
{"text":"If i could give this place zero stars I so would!  Memphis CHAMPIONSHIP Barbecue? more like...Memphis Yuckyionship Barbecue!  So we walk in and are \"greeted\" by these teenagers that just stare at us then after a minute of standing there they finally say something she asked how many i looked at the both of us counted and said uh two...duh  So we get seated the waitress takes our order we both order the \"blue ribbon lunch special\" for the main dish you can choose two meats and one side I chose the brisket and hot links with a side of baked beans. The brisket was EXTREMELY EXTREMELY  EXTREMELY DRY I cant stretch that enough! I thought I was chewing on a tire that had been left in the sahara desert for 20 years then taken to the sun for another 20 years thats how dry and rough the brisket was. The hot links were ok at best and the beans were just gross.   The food came out cold and the service was awful the only time I saw our waitress was to get our order, drop off the food and drop the check, not once did she come back to check and see if the food was ok or even offer refills on our drinks.   Horrible food (check) Bad service (check) Waste of 45 mins outta my life that I can never get back (check)   Please avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Truth be told, I've never had great BBQ at Memphis Championship and I've eaten at three different locations here in the city. Generally speaking I find most of their meats to be on the dry side and sometimes even cold-ish. Not sure if they have trouble timing thier butts and brisket or just do one batch of meat a day then keep it barely warm? The smoky flavor is always there and the sauces are good enough, just seems to be lacking freshness and expertise, cooking time wise.     I went for a quick lunch today with a co-worker and had the burnt ends(Smoky brisket chunks)and the fries and salad. I think I actually go here more because I like the thick-ish friesand crisp side salad and high quality blue cheese dressing more than the meat itself which is kinda sad for a BBQ place. Again the flavorful burnt ends were kinda cold and certainly been sitting a while. This is not a dish that is gonna be fresh and juicy but Ive had these at many superior BBQ places where they retain a bit more moisture.   The service at Memphis is always quick and rock solid on my visits. Just wish they'd pay a bit more attention to the important thing...the meat."}
{"text":"A little pricey for what they gave me. The BBQ meat is just OK the sides were really good especially the greens. and the Apple Ice tea is really good and served in a big Jar. Would Come back for some more of that ice tea....."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place for years and it is great and consistent. Lunch is my normal meal and The King is always great and served in authentic Memphis style with cole slaw on the sandwich. The ribs, chicken and anything that comes off the smoker is also good. You can also get REAL sweet tea here and for a treat try the Sweet Apple tea. I'm not sure it's authentic never having had it in Memphis, but it's still good.   Being from the South and loving real Memphis style BBQ eating here is the next best thing to being on The River!   They have a few of these around town and I've eaten at a couple of others. They seem to all be equal quality."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite BBQ spots. Great atmosphere. Nice big portion sizes. Friendly staff. Went here for lunch last Sunday. Delicious"}
{"text":"We've never had bad service from this place until last night. The server kept disappearing when we needed something, forgot things with an order, and when asked for a takeout box we had to ask someone else because she was blatantly talking to her co workers, when to pay she was across the place TALKING, and she forgot to bring out bread for 35 mins and again we asked someone else. I've never been so angry with such bad service. I love their food but the service wasn't great."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! Try the creamed corn. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the service was slow for non peak hours."}
{"text":"I don't know how close Memphis is to being considered \"Real BBQ\" and I have seen some of the reviews here bashing on this place claiming It Is an Imposter of Real Authentic Wholesome American BBQ... but all I can say Is this place has DAMN good BBQ... I love this place, love the food, love the staff, love the old juke box, love it love it love it! I would come here everyday If I didn't care for cardiac arrest or obesity."}
{"text":"3-14-2016  I ate at the Warm Springs location for the first time last night.  My friends and I were greeted and seated immediately.  The location was very clean and had a nice comfortable feeling.  There were several TV's tuned to different channels and it was nice to watch some games  I thought I'd probably miss.  Our drink order was taken quickly and we ordered a sampler platter that was excellent.  The food I especially liked were the chicken wings, burnt ends, potato skins, onion strings, okra, ribs, mac & cheese, red beans and rice.  Everyone liked their choices and I tasted the banana pudding for desert, and it was good but I really loved the strawberry shortcake.  The prices were reasonable and we enjoyed our experience.  My only complaint which is a small/minor one is,  I like to eat crushed/chipped ice in my drinks and they only had large cubed ice.   I know that seems petty but that's what I like.  Other than that, I recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"OMG!! So flippin good! The apple ice tea, and the ribs are to die for! The wait staff is friendly, and helpful.  If you like BBQ this is the place to go in Vegas! No really, the only place to go in Vegas for BBQ!!  Burnt ends are so good here, the ribs are amazing.. Lot's of food, bring rubber pockets, or get a to go bag you will most likely need it."}
{"text":"Eh! Being that we're from Memphis we were a little let down, the Fried Pickles were really good, the Sweet Tea wasn't sweet, the sauces on the table were go so we had to soak the pulled pork with it, the slaw isn't creamy like we were use to either but it was tasty, Stop toasting your bread, nice soft bread with pulled pork is better, the Okra wasn't too great, the Mac and Cheese was pretty good...we won't try it again."}
{"text":"Food is ok, but not great. I got the king which is at the top of the menu and a specialty or something. It's a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. The coleslaw had good flavor but the pork was VERY bland. Didn't taste barbecued all. Since the flavor was lacking I used some of their bottled sauce that was at the table. I don't know how this place has become a Las Vegas legend with sauce like this...it doesn't even taste like bbq sauce and it's way too sweet. The sides (Mac and cheese and fried okra) were decent...but nothing too exciting. I'll probably come back to see if their ribs can make up for the sandwich...but I'd rather eat Lucile's Barbecue if I'm wanting bbq."}
{"text":"Dropped in the first week of January 2009 for some lunch after getting off the plane.   I had a craving for pull pork and this place was the closest to the airport.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was excellent.  Make sure you drown the sandwich is BBQ sauce.  If you eat this sandwich making a mess, then you have done it right.  I have to go back and try their ribs.  Very decent BBQ....I would recommend you yelpers give it a try."}
{"text":"Stopped by Memphis Championship Barbecue with my brother, his girlfriend, and my Dad - my brother and his girlfriend have been here many times and enjoy it. We were greeted and seated right away.   There were so many appetizers that we wanted to try ... So we did. We started with an order of corn muffins, a combo basket of fried pickles and onion straws, deviled eggs, and burnt ends. The corn muffins were delicious and my favorite appetizer. Warm muffins with fresh corn baked inside - with the sweet, cinnamon sugar butter, it was tasty. The deviled eggs were OK - oddly a little sweet which I'm not used to and wasn't a huge fan of. The burnt ends were very tasty and my second favorite appetizer. The fried pickles and onion straws were just OK - a little too greasy and the fried pickles were cut too thin.   For dinner, I ordered the combo plate of BBQ chicken and sausage links. For my two sides, I ordered steamed vegetables and sweet potato. The BBQ chicken was moist and seasoned well. Loved the sausage links - they gave a generous portion and it had a wonderful spicy kick. I wasn't impressed with the steamed vegetables and the sweet potato was too sweet (with too much butter and too much cinnamon sugar).   Overall, a decent meal but not the best BBQ I've ever had. For Vegas, I'm sure it's probably some of the best BBQ you can find."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed this place. Let me start by saying that the service was exceptional. My servers name was Laura and she is amazing!!  I gave it 5 stars!! I had the Burnt Ends  (brisket), Cream Corn, Baked Beans, and Baked Sweet Potato w/Brown Sugar Butter Sauce.   If you like smoked BBQ then you'll love this place. The food was FABULOUS. The meat was Very tender  and the sides were rich in flavor. They also have really good warm dinner rolls served with applewood butter.   The drinks were also delicious not to sweet Strawberry Lemonade and Apple sweet tea.   I recommend this place to all local as well as visitors.   Thanks again Laura for the best service. See you again real soon!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband go here at least once a week! If you want amazing BBQ and fantastic service this is the place to go! Also, they serve the fountain drinks and water in Kerr jars (like mason jars) adds a nice touch to the whole atmosphere! Definitely give this place a try, you will get hooked!  I have no idea how so many people have so many negative comments. I've never had cold food. The service is fantastic and very quick and contrary to one of the other reviewers you do NOT just get one basket of bread, you want more you can ask for it and many times the waiter will ask you if you'd like more. And for crying out loud who wants to fill up on bread and lose room in your stomach for that fantastic BBQ. Seriously some of these reviewers must have been high or had a bad day when they went ate here.  Edit: Still absolutely love this place over a year later, as I was reading some of the comments I noticed someone (Simon C.) gave a terrible review for the waiter Shawn. I have to say something as Shawn is my FAVORITE waiter. He is SO attentive, I never need to ask for a refill, and he checks up on us often. We have gotten to know Shawn over past year and a half and he is so sweet. When he heard that I had my little boy and we were in the restaurant he came over real quick to see him and say congrats. He was there oh, 2 min maybe and then went right back to work."}
{"text":"Ordered from GRUBHUB! The food was in good quality still very hot. Driver was nice and delivered the food very promptly. Will definitely order from here again! Their baked potatoes are always so BIG and AMAZING! :)"}
{"text":"First, let me say the food is good. Now to the reason I am posting, I witnessed a SCAM here that you can only see in a dump like Vegas. This business probably does half or more of its business with Air Force folks, and Friday, 8-7-15, some BUM came in with a woman and proceeded to fleece some poor AF Sergeant for lunch.   Yes, this guy, claiming to be an Army vet, asked this generous guy to buy their lunch. This gentleman, bless his soul, bought lunch for them. The amazing part was when the waiter was told, the restaurant did not write off the moochers lunch and accepted payment from the kind Airman. So beware, if you are in uniform and a fairly obvious BUM approaches you with his Army vet story, please tell the waiter or somebody, as I am fairly sure Memphis BBQ doesn't want this mooch to start frequenting the place."}
{"text":"After an event at the LV Motor Speedway, hunger pangs struck.   I'd eaten a meal catered by Memphis Barbecue awhile back and it was fabulous so we were delighted by the small neon sign of Memphis Barbecue.  Drive through was a big plus.     A young woman's voice came through the speaker box.  Sadly, she spoke veryveryveryvery fast and we couldn't understand our options.  Friend had a fish sandwich.  I asked for pulled pork sandwich.  Veryveryveryvery fast talking woman said \"OK, you have two sides with that,\" so we asked for two potato sides.    We pulled forward, paid the bill (including a tip for fast talking woman and were asked to pull to the side for a short wait while the fish sandwich was prepared.    The food was delivered about 15 minutes later, which is fine.  We understand that certain dishes are time consuming to prepare.    It all fell apart when we found not one, not two but three potato sides in the bag and no pulled pork sandwich.   It seemed my hunger grew huge as we inspected every single tin-foiled wrapped item.   Then we looked at the bill.  Charged for three potato based sides and no pulled pork sandwich.    I went into the restaurant with the bill.  The manager was indifferent to the error but prepared the sandwich I'd requested.   I asked the young fast talking girl how this could have happened since she read the order back to us correctly.   She didn't know.  Well I don't know how it happened either.   But I know what I said and I know she read it back to me.  Summing it up, great barbecue, but failure to listen is a major reason for problems in the world.  A simple, \"We apologize\", would have made things so much better."}
{"text":"Of the more well-known barbecue joints in town, this is my favorite so far. In my opinion the barbecue here is generally more flavorful than at Famous Dave's another big player in town.  Memphis Championship Barbecue used to have a restaurant on Rainbow that I would regularly visit, but this closed down several years ago. Thus, the original restaurant near Nellis AFB on North Las Vegas Boulevard is now the most conveniently located  place for me to go to get my barbecue fix.  The reliability of receiving their promised birthday promotion (buy one meal and get one free) for people on the email list is sporadic at best. In some years - such as in 2017- I received it while this year (2018) it was once again a no-show. In years gone by, it used to arrive regularly like clockwork. Perhaps, Memphis plans to eliminate this promo in the near future or already has done so?  One of my personal favorites here is the brisket as part of either a two or three-meat combo plate with pulled pork or ribs as the remaining options.  However, my top choice by far is the Grand Champion Plate (currently about $24.00 and well worth it!) which essentially let's you try a little bit of everything barbecued that Memphis has to offer. This also was the entree that I would usually purchase with the aforementioned birthday promotion.  The servers are invariably friendly and attentive and the portions are generous, so wait until you have a big appetite before coming here to make the trip worthwhile.   Takeout orders are also available for those adventurous souksy who prefer consuming their delectable barbecue on the run just like Bonnie and Clyde."}
{"text":"Fantastic barbeque.  The sauce is great, but you don't even need it!  They've got that low-and-slow thing down!  The pulled pork and brisket are the best items on the menu.  Only meat offering that we pass on is the Hot Links - they're not *bad* just not as stellar as everything else on the menu.  The sauce is a thin vinegar/tomato based sauce - not like a sweet, sticky Kansas City sauce.  Portions are large - this is a great restaurant for sharing.  If you've got 4 or 5 people, the Mama Faye's platter is a great deal and WAY more food than you'd need.  Oh, and try the Memphis Skins for an appetizer: potato skins piled high with pulled pork and cheddar.  Dunno what the creamy sauce is that they bring with them... I always just reach for more barbeque sauce!  A wide variety of side dishes, the best of which are the green beans, macaroni and cheese, french fries and the baked sweet potatoes (served still wrapped in foil with brown sugar & cinnamon.)  We've been going to Memphis for years now and have never had a bad experience.  The wait staff is always great, friendly and cool."}
{"text":"A couple of my co-workers were talking about how good the buffalo chicken salad was.... I'm me to the area, so I'm always in the mood to try new things. This wasn't a great first impression of the place.   I ordered to go, and called my order in and picked it up through the drive-thru.  Which is nice and convenient.  I also got a side of fried okra.  I'll start with the okra... tasted ok, was very light and flaky.  Honestly I prefer a little bit more crisp and breading to the okra.   Overall the buffalo chicken salad was pretty bland. You get your choice of blue cheese or ranch dressing. I chose ranch. The salad was you're typical iceberg salad mix, topped with two onion circles, croutons, 4 cherry tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and the buffalo chicken.  I'll start by saying the buffalo sauce and chicken was decent, but the croutons were \"mushy\" and there wasn't much allure to it besides the chicken and sauce.   I'll choose something different next time."}
{"text":"Not like it was, at one time a great place to eat, now if you say anything about your incorrect meal your servicer gets pissed off, use to come here weekly but stopped & now I know why, they just don't care & it shows, will not be back that's for sure!"}
{"text":"so ordered food for carryout with a bunch of people at work. they got my sandwich wrong, drove back on lunch to get it corrected. they corrected me but gave me a cold ass sandwich with warmed a warmed up bun. seriously? unless the turkey club is supposed to be cold. cause the first one I got seemed pretty warm."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service sucked. I took it to go so fortunately I didn't have to hear too much of that. Other than that the St Louis Ribs are bomb, mac & cheese bomb, but the front counter girls need some work."}
{"text":"Went to Memphis and placed an order at the drive thru.  The total came to a lot more than the prices on the menu, so I asked what was up.  Turns out they charge dinner prices if you order at the drive thru, even during lunch hours.  That's insane!  Had Hawaiian BBQ across the street instead."}
{"text":"Okay, so this review has been looooong overdue! Let me start out by saying that I have been to BOTH locations, so this is pretty much a two for one review. STAFF: After hearing my friends speak so highly about the quality of BBQ coming from this place, we decided it was time to see for ourselves in April. There was TWO car loads of us coming in last minute, the restaurant was getting ready to close for the night. Instead of giving us the good ol' \"sorry, we're closed!\" attitude. We were asked if we wouldn't mind dining at their second location because the kitchen was closed, a phone call was made to their second location. The staff was incredibly sweet enough to agree to stay late to serve our party. The hostess then apologised for any inconvenience this may have caused. Are you kidding me?! It was our fault for not checking the business hours before going, so thank you! When we finally arrived to their second location, EVERYONE was incredibly hospitable, not once were we mistreated for keeping them late.  FOOD: It's a shame that I never photographed how amazing my food looked, and trust me, the food tasted just as amazing as it looked!  OVER ALL: We came back again to this specific location in May, and we were not surprised to have been treated just as graciously as the first! I can't wait to come back next time I'm in Las Vegas. It's no surprise this place has been awarded so many times."}
{"text":"Baby back ribs where great sides Mac and cheese very good backed beans fantastic. Got the choose 3 appetizer burnt ends fried pickles and onion strips well worth it. Great over all"}
{"text":"I love myself some BBQ but I can honestly say that Memphis BBQ has truly falling off the map for quality of food. The briskets was very tough and the rolls was hard as well. I even have to ask the waitress if she could warm my biscuits up inside of a microwave because they were just so hard. This will be the only place I will go to only for last resorts if McDonald's was closed. I would choose fast food over this place, just being honest."}
{"text":"This is our sixth year at MBBQ for Thanksgiving, third year at this location, to have our family turkey dinner. The food is amazing and $17 per adult is amazing for all-you-can-eat without going to a casino buffet. Bonus-they send leftovers home with you and there's no spending your morning cooking and evening cleaning. Couldn't be happier! Servers Shawn and Shelly were fantastic!! See you next year!"}
{"text":"I don't understand people's excitement over this place.  I have tried this restaurant 4 times over the last three years and each time its worse.  I keep going back because people rave about it and I try to understand hoping I have missed something, but the food here is awful.  I mean bad.  I left 3/4 of my brisket and ribs on the plate.  It's disgusting.  Maybe it is just me, but I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I don't know WHO thinks this is real BBQ. They must have either 1) never eaten real BBQ or 2) never had food with flavor before.  This CRAP is disgusting, bad location, no flavor. Brisket sandwich had NO flavor or bbq sauce and all fatty meat. The TriTip was just a few slices of fatty meat with no flavor.The hus puppies were OK, kinda burnt. For $25 bucks I'd rather eat anywhere else. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This place is expensive and definitely not as good as you find in Tennessee lol. Their smoked turkey is not good and everything else is good enough but not for the price"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with co-workers. We sat in the bar area, and our waitress quickly said hello and got us menus. So far no problems. We started out with an order of onion strings, which our party of 4 quickly finished. When the waitress brought out our drinks, we asked for another order.   I had the slider lunch special which was 3 sliders and 2 sides for $8.50. The pulled pork was the best of the sliders, the chicken was way too dry. I did like the creamed corn and cucumber salad I got as sides.   Our waitress was very chatty, to the point of annoyance. And we never got the second order of onion strings. Overall I wasn't impressed, I prefer Lucille's and Famous Daves by far."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is Carrie - one of the waitresses. The staff is super friendly and attentive, especially Carrie.   The food could have been better. The St. Louis ribs were pretty yummy, and they made me a yummy, strong margarita, but the sides were only so-so.  Mac & cheese was ok. Coleslaw had good flavor but was swimming in dressing..."}
{"text":"I have been to this BBQ restaurant three times because I love BBQ and it is close to my house.  I won't go back.  The brisket is dry, the baked potatoes are cooked the day before (I always go in for lunch) and they taste like it.  Yesterday, I ordered the St Louis Ribs, the waitress brought babyback.  I sent them back and she brought back more babyback...swore they were St Louis...okaaaay.  The good things:  the sweet tea is delicious and the rolls and honey butter are delicious, and the service is good, but the food is really not very good, time to search for another place for BBQ."}
{"text":"For people who don't recognize \"REAL\" Southern Style BBQ from Texas, Memphis or even Kansas City (Gates BBQ), or even Los Angeles, then this may be good enough for them.  I went to this place yesterday after seeing their like page online a few times.  Boy was I extremely disappointed.  I ordered a three meat combo that goes for $19.99 (plus tax), which gives you \"three small baby back ribs, one small link cut up  and about four or five tiny slices of beef cut up with two side orders.\"  Looked like a \"kids meal.\"  This was by far the stingiest BBQ establishment I have even gone to in my entire life.  You can go to Road Kill Grill and get a three meat combo for $16.45 and get \"PLENTY\" of meat and the BBQ is good.  The two meat combo at Road Kill Grill for $14.45 gives you more meat than these folks three meat combo.  In Los Angeles, there is a place called Ribs Nest of El Segundo and Western ave that has \"REALLY GOOD\" BBQ and their three meat combo last time I checked was around $15.50.  They too give you PLENTY of meat and sauce.  I will \"NEVER\" patronize this establishment again.  Overpriced and you get NOTHING for the money.  Shame on them!"}
{"text":"Before  I rant... the Manager did take one of the plates off our bill...so that was a plus.    We looked up the best BBQ places in Vegas (Google) and this place was at the top. Looking over the reviews on Yelp we figured it was going to be good.   I ordered the pork sandwich with potato salad. My wife ordered the brisket plate with mash potatoes and collard greens.   My meal... it's hard to describe... the pork at no flavor at all...it's topped with coleslaw and BBQ sauce. I added salt...magic dust...and two kinds of BBQ sauce to get some sort of flavor going. The potato salad tasted store bought.   My wife's plate.  Brisket.... brisket should be fork tender... no knife should ever be needed. It lacked flavor as well... and was tough/chewy.  She thought it had the consistency of boiled meat. The greens tasted like they were from a can... no flavor/seasoning. The mashed potatoes...straight from a box.  (her meal was taken off the bill as she didn't eat 95% of it.)   When you walk in to the place... you see the grand champion signs from 12 years ago over the doors... maybe this was a killer BBQ place back then... but... I can't say the same for it now. I would not recommend this place off the experience we had. I'm sure there are many more BBQ joints in Vegas worth trying...  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I tired this place today for the first time, the food seemed a little hit and miss.  Things I liked; sweet tea, honey butter, soft bread, brisket, and the s'mores dessert.  Things that were a little miss; corn on the cob, mac and cheese, green beans, and the turkey.  I supposed I would eat here again if I was in the area but it's not really in an area I would go out of my way to get to.  If that makes any sense at all.  Thumbs down to the odd bathroom layouts and stalls that are missing hooks for your purse."}
{"text":"This wont be a long review but let me say that of all the places that Mike Mills the man who in BBQ circles is referred to as The Legend could have picked for another place to set up shop LAs Vegas should consider themselves lucky he picked them.  THe menu is the same as at 17th Bar and Grill in Murphysboro IL and everything is good. It has something for everyone and even though I I frequent 17th when I am in Illinois I still make a point to hit MCB because it reminds me of home when I am traveling.  the meats are all fantastic, the hot links are some of the best I have had. The sides are all good and quality. The portion size is a bit small on ale carte sides but the meat and platter portions are very ample.   They have fresh pork rinds hot from the frier and deviled eggs that remind you of the one's your aunt used to make for family reunions.  I could go on and on about this place but just go and order what you think looks good, if you cant decide get the Grand Champion's Plate and prepare to not eat for the next 3 days since you will still be full.  enjoy"}
{"text":"This place seems like a hidden little gem. I enjoy this place much more than Famous Dave's and Lucille's. Prices are great and the servers seem to remember  you and what you like. The deviled eggs are awesome and can't  go wrong with the 2 meat combo. The chicken is moist with a pink tint from the smoke. Overall a great BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food! \"The King\" is a mountain size pulled pork sandwich served w coleslaw and a delicious tangy sauce. Great service! Sit down, drive up, call in, or catering service available. Mouth watering delicious!"}
{"text":"First time I had eaten here in a long time and we wont be back! 3 of us ordered the brown bag special through drive thru. Waited at least 15 minutes with no one else in line. Food was HORRIBLE! Moldy bread, dry meat, cold fries. What happened to this place? My coworker called after and spoke with a manager names Markini? She didn't seem that concerned and acted like we were lying. Offered a free meal to her but why would she go back? Why would any of us? Well, unless you like green bread....."}
{"text":"This place must spend a ton of money on advertising to be considered championship barbecue. My trip there was a total bust. The ribs were dry and not tasty at all. The mac and cheese was like store bought stuff. I went there several years back and enjoyed myself. It seems like they are just buying cheap products and trying to dress it up and failing at that miserably. Don't waste your time, go to Famous Daves or similiar to get real bbq."}
{"text":"I have been coming here my whole life. No matter what any one says mike mills knows how to make bbq. He has one championship after championship for his ribs. Don't come to this place if you're looking for crappy famous daves style bbq. Come here for the best ribs you will ever find.    They have the best ribs and smoked bbq you will find in Las Vegas. We have catered from Memphis for almost every occasion. Their rolls are baked fresh and served warm with their awesome honey butter. The nachos are a family favorite served with crisp chips, pulled pork, cheese, red beans, green onions, sour creme, jalapeños and most importantly their sauce. The original sauce is my favorite, though the spicy is pretty good too. We always get a rack of ribs along with other items. Pulled pork shoulder sandwich or just the meat is my favorite.  My father loves their potato salad and coleslaw, along with the red beans and rice.   If you're looking for great service and great ribs this is where you go."}
{"text":"I prefer Lucilles (The one in the district, not the one in Red Rock) But it was my dads birthday and this is what he wanted.   Our waitress was extremely friendly and attentive.  I ordered the bbq pork stuffed baked potato and it was actually really good. It lacked sauce, but I guess that what they keep bottles of it on the table. I tried little bites of everyone else's food and all their meats were good. And I absolutely love their rolls and the butter that comes with.  The sides were eh, my sister had the mac n cheese and it was bland. My dad had creamed corn and there was way more cream than corn.  Overall I like Memphis, but if I had a choice, it wouldn't be my first pick."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. I'd been craving some BBQ since arriving in Vegas and happen to drive by Memphis Championship BBQ. This seemed like a chain restaurant and the interior was large and clean and nicely decorated .   My order the lunch combo of two meats, my choices the baby back & St Louis ribs with the 2  side choices - mac and cheese and Cole slaw.  My waiter was friendly and on the spot. The food arrived within minutes of ordering. I preferred the St Louis style ribs due to the seasoned rub and lightly smoked flavor. The baby backs were tender and meaty but were just average. The slaw was a vinegar based flavor which was tangy and unique. The mac and cheese reminded me Kraft Mac and cheese flavor that I ate when younger - nothing to write home about.  Overall, a decent dinning experience and less then $15.00 for lunch and a beverage excluding tip."}
{"text":"I needed to kill some time before catching a flight back home and Memphis BBQ is conveniently near the McCcarran airport car rental facility.   My order the combo lunch with baby back ribs, hot links, Mac and cheese, baked beans and a diet Pepsi.  Overall the food was just OK. The stand out was the baked beans - delish flavor with several types of beans made this a stand out. The ribs were just average - dry and flavor less. I had to add BBQ sauce to make em edible. Links were just eh and the Mac and cheese was flat!  What was solid here was the service from my waitress Carrie. Very accommodating and whe made sure everything was good throughout my entire lunch. For her efforts I raised the overall rating of this review.  Will I return here? Possibly but I'll try different items next time."}
{"text":"I attended Memphis BBQ with a party of 15 and was seated in a semi private room which was quite nice. The staff was helpful but I felt they were overwhelmed with our party that a few requests were forgoten besides that everything was good except for the main course. Appetizers were pretty good: sampler (includes Onion rings, chicken wings, fried okra, potato skins and deep fried dill pickles which i recommend tasting for your first time) and their nachos were ok and sweet.   For my main course I ordered the 15th anniversary ribs trio and found all three ribs to be very dry and disgusting. It wasn't tender and it lacked flavor! Sadly for a restaurant named after their ribs they failed to satisfy. Sorry Memphis BBQ!"}
{"text":"I'm not enough of a BBQ connessoir to know how authentic their bbq is but I find Memphis Championship BBQ to be great tasting and a great value.    Their Grand Champion Plate is huge and a great value; one order can easily feed two and includes beef and pork ribs, chicken, links, pulled pork and brisket.   The chicken fried steak is also very good."}
{"text":"Gotta Try \"The King\" one of the best pulled pork sandwiches ever.  This place is one of the first restaurants I frequented when I first moved to Vegas.  I pretty much stick with \"the King\" when I go but I know a lot of people like the buffalo chicken salad too.  The \"Magic Dust\" and Vinegar based BBQ are great.  The atmosphere is southern and kid friendly.  The booths are pretty comfortable can seat about 8 if you need to."}
{"text":"Drinks are served in mason jars which is really cool, but thats really the only thing that caught my attention. Ribs were decent, BBQ sauce was really watery and did not taste like BBQ, the Mac & Cheese was also decent, the BBQ beans had a unique taste and were pretty good and while bread was pretty good it did not taste fresh and was pretty dry on the inside, definitely needed to be eaten with some butter. Their butter was mixed with honey so it was delicious. Overall, I probably would not go back to this place with so many, much better, BBQ places here in town for the same price."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic,  for those of you who complain about slow service; Have you ever been down south? The servers here are so much quicker.  You can also order ahead and pickup in the drive thru."}
{"text":"Service was good waitresses friendly I ordered the burnt ends and they were fairly awful. I went because it was close to my motel. I will drive farther for food next time. Beware."}
{"text":"Since I was next door getting tires put on, I thought I'd give this place a try. This place during lunch time was very slow. The staff seemed lifeless like the  slow dining business. I ordered the combo lunch deal with 2 meats and a side. I added St. Louis ribs to it so I  could have a taste of the burnt tips, brisket, and cream of corn. I felt like I was stuck in time or a morgue. There just isn't any spirit here, not even Christmas. What a way to kill time for my tires to be installed. I will say the value seemed like a great deal when I ordered, but neh. It was not what the reviews say. It was tasteless and even with the sauces, it didn't help. The best satisfying part was the cream of corn. Not even the waitress said Thank you. Duh, no wonder it's dead and lifeless in here."}
{"text":"Sad this place has gone down hill, as other have mentioned lately. Just ate here with same disappointment. The brisket was dry, pulled pork had NO flavor, the hot links were cheap tasting. The service by Carrie was good. Don't waste your monies....."}
{"text":"I ordered at the drive thru, so I wasn't near by when I discovered not only did they forget to include a fork, the collard greens were too sweet, and they forgot the slaw on the sandwich. That's what makes the sandwich! Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Bread pudding is delicious. I stopped by with a group for the first time in a long time and I was wondering why it was so empty at lunch time. Nice place for big parties and they are ok with separate checks. I am not sure what changed, but it is not as popular as is used to be. Today I had the baby back rib lunch special and it was good, not outstanding. The menus were falling apart and the table was pretty dirty which is a bit gross. I would not go out of my way to go back. The service was good, but the wait was long for a lunch period and when it was not that busy."}
{"text":"We decided to stop for lunch and order food to go. We had The King and the Smoked Brisket sandwiches. I liked my brisket sandwich (the burnt ends were especially good). For sides, we had steamed veggies, fries, hush puppies and red beans and rice. All were tasty. The prices were reasonable, service was quick and the food was good."}
{"text":"First time guest,  pretty solid BBQ. Had the stuffed deviled eggs as an app and 3 meat combo.  Burnt Ends were 5-Stars, Brisket was good, beef sausage was not my favorite, too salty and not my favorite type.  Had sides of potato salad and green beans (typical and good). My friend had a BBQ pulled pork salad and he gives it a 5 Stars.  Overall pretty solid but not quite 5-Stars.  Waitress Desiree was excellent.  Loved the giant Mason Jars of iced tea. Prices were very fair and portions pretty huge."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would.  I ordered just about $80 worth if food to go and the ONLY thing my husband and I liked was our creamed corn, and Strawberry lemonade.  Cold chicken Rubbery brisket Cold baked potatoes  Dry mashed potatoes  Vinegary red liquid (I guess it was their barbecue sauce) Day old cornbread muffins  Extremely dry Strawberry Shortcake   Everything was bad, not ONE menu item was good we threw it away and went back out for something else."}
{"text":"The pulled pork shoulder is where it's at! You get 2 sides but the meat is really what's it's all about. Some of the most tender and juicy pork that you'll ever taste. Everytime I do, I thank the universe for not allowing me to be a vegan or vegetarian. The service here can be spotty - hence the lower rating but the food is solid and the restaurant deserves more than a 3 star rating. So many bbq haters out there."}
{"text":"good - most times the meat needed extra sauce.  don't be in a rush for lunch."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst I have ever had or reviewed. No, it was THE WORST now that I think about it. I'm easy to please, just read my other reviews. I understand the \"casual dining\" concept and as long as the food is average, the beer cold, the service decent, and the room clean, it gets an A in my book. This place gets an F.  Specifically, I ordered the half rack of ribs and a side of mac and cheese and mash potatoes. The food arrived 3 minutes after I ordered it! Now, I understand that in a place like this the food has to be cooked in advance.But 3 minutes!? It looked and tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours. The ribs were pure fat and the mashed taters were lumps of paste. It wasn't edible.  I reserve my special distaste for the service. Yes, it was fast, but when I asked what beers they had the waitress said that she didn't know because she didn't drink beer! She went back to the kitchen to find out and upon her return had trouble pronouncing such foreign beers such as \"budweiser\" and \"coors\"  The best part was the check.We had an AMEX prepaid gift card, good wherever AMEX is accepted, including Memphis BBQ. Our waitress returned the card to our table with the excuse that the cash register had never been set up for this. At this point we just wanted to get out of there so I paid with my regular green AMEX card which, surprise, surprise, was accepted with no problem!  Now, to be clear, the restaurant was clean and the food came quickly. But the management really needs to get a handle on food quality and provide some basic training for their employees. This slice of the casual dining market is very competitive and their are much better places to go than this place."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a cool theme and even features cool Memphis memorabilia. The BBQ has its ups and down when it comes to tender vs dry. I usually go for the stuffed baked potatoes with pork because it helps BBQ cravings and the meat is usually still tender. I love the creamed corn side and the warm rolls with honey butter. If you don't mind salty and fried the fried pickles basket is a good appetizer."}
{"text":"Oh yuck! Green beans were not edible. No idea where they got the recipe for cream corn, but shred it. Potato salad was just edible. Ribs and brisket tasted weird, probably because of the wood they used. The sauce tasted like 57 heavily diluted with vinegar.   Just horrible, next time I want Bbq and I'm near there I'll drive the extra few miles to dickies!"}
{"text":"When it comes to BBQ I'm all about sweet sauce. When my friend told me about this place he told me they use a vinegar based sauce. I've never had vinegar BBQ sauce so I had to try it.  I went during the lunch hour and the had a reasonably good prices.  I had the two meat platter (ribs and spicy sausage).  The food was good, the sauce and magic dust were on point."}
{"text":"Not so much... The spot is right next to my house and I was really hoping I'd love it but... No. We got wings, Mac n cheese, ribs, frenchfries and bread pudding and everything tasted as if it was just defrosted and thrown in a microwave. Yeah, don't see myself ever eating here again..."}
{"text":"Still my favorite BBQ place in Vegas! Didn't call ahead & got a perfect order from the drive up service, on top of the guy helping me was spot on giving me extra sauce for orders! Thanks for the awesome food & the only place I can see getting BBQ from!!"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. I ordered a combo ribs and chicken. Ribs were bland and not very tender. I didnt like their rub and sauce. ( Frankly, Baby Rays bbq sauce is much better!) Chicken was tender but again bland. I declined dessert. Sides of Cole slaw and Mac n cheese were not good either. Waitress was friendly and attentive. She gets the 2 stars."}
{"text":"First time eating here with the family we ordered the mama Faye platter and let me say it definitely feeds more than 4 people so we have plenty of left overs. Service is very good and the food came out really quick. I'll be back here for sure. 2 thumbs up. The prices are very fair, and my favorite part of the meal were the hot links, favorite side was the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Always love their food. Despite being fairly slow the night I went, our service was on the slow side. Would still recommend this place to anyone, the brisket is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Super disappointed... Memphis Championship???  Are you kidding me? -.-  PROS: -Very spacious, doesn't get crowded; good for big parties/gathering -Food comes out within minutes! -Large portions -Cheap -Excellent service -Sell their sauces  CONS: No matter how many pros there are, the most important thing about a restaurant is the TASTE! We ordered the Family Style Dinner for Four ($69.99) with full rack baby back ribs, 1/2lb pork, 1/2lb beef brisket, 1/2lb beef sausage, one whole chicken, baked beans, cole slaw, french fries, ane sweet cream corn, and rolls. -YES, it is HUGE. 4 adults could not finish. -Food came out so fast... obviously premade -Food was lukewarm -Every type of meat in this dish had the SAME EXACT BBQ SAUCE... boring -Ribs barely had meat and were not tender -Creamed corn was toooooo sweet   I guess you will like this place if you love their sauce so much. But in my taste, I think a frozen Tony Romas baby back ribs from the market taste much better.  So how do they have so many trophies?... o_o"}
{"text":"Great Ribs. Great I tell ya. Their magic dust is great on just about all their food. I can't seem to get enough of their ribs. I have not tried their pulled pork but I might try that next time. But yeah, definitely the best ribs in Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered the two item combo with 2 sides.  I selected the brisket and pork shoulder with mac and okra.  I also need more veggies so I got a dinner salad.  The impressive start was the rolls.  Amazing soft rolls with a crispy top.  These rolls are dangerous.  You can't stop eating them.  I don't know if they will give you free refills, but I didn't ask because I would eat those.  The brisket was very tender, flavorful and just fell apart.  Big smoke ring on it.  The pork shoulder is smoked without the skin.  This is a drawback.  The skin provides fat and also has that crunchy chicarone texture.  This pork lacked the fat from the skin and the crunch.  Pass on the port next time.  The fried okra was the hot tip.  The mac and cheese was disappointing.  It tasted good, but the texture is just like the old mac and cheese out of the Kraft box.  I think Mac N Cheese should be baked with a crusty topping.  I didn't finish my meal so I could try the Bread Pudding.  This was the BOMB.  You gotta save room for this pudding.  So, just 4 stars because I think the pork shoulder and Mac can use some fine tuning."}
{"text":"This spot didn't quite live up to the hype for me. The food is okay, but not the best BBQ I've had. I would definitely still eat here if someone else had interest or I was in the area, but I wouldn't seek it out on my own.  My office ordered from here last week and we were able to order a variety of items to try. I was able to try four different meats, five sides, and cornbread muffins.  Let's start with meat since that is the main reason one would visit a BBQ restaurant. The sausage was my favorite meat. It was slightly spicy and smoky with a nice amount of moistness. The chicken was moist and had a nice flavor. The burnt ends had a nice flavor and plenty of tasty sauce, but the pieces were inconsistent on moistness. Some of the pieces were most, but others were dry. The brisket had okay flavor, but was some of the driest brisket I've had from any BBQ restaurant. I liked the flavor of the BBQ sauce that came on the side.   My favorite sides was the baked beans because they had a nice sweet taste. The beans were also a variety of kinds which made it a little different. The fried okra was awesome and I liked that the breading was light. The macaroni and cheese was sufficient, but not amazing. Mashed potatoes seemed instant. The steamed vegetables were good for a healthy side. I liked the cornbread muffins. They were moist when warm and the honey butter was a nice touch.   The takeout order was well packaged. The BBQ sauce came in individual cups and anything that could leak was inside of a plastic bag. They also included plates and utensils."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.  It has been about 2years since I last came to this Memphis. Food old, it felt like you ate left overs, dry and not fresh. To top it off there are cockroaches around the tables."}
{"text":"What happened???   This used to be my favorite BBQ restaurant but haven't been here for years.  Went back in last nite and what a difference.  Our waitress was wonderful, but the food was so bland.  My friend had the BBQ pork sandwich w/coleslaw on top.  The meat was tender, but no flavor and very little coleslaw.  I had the chopped pork salad, and again, no flavor.  Had to drown the salad in BBQ sauce to taste anything.  I ordered a side of fries to share, and at $2.75 I would have expected a basket.  Instead it was about 20 fries on saucer.  The salad greens were cold and crisp though."}
{"text":"We ate here after donating blood for United Blood Services Blood MObile, part of our scheduled donation and as part of the drive they comped every donor with a FREE Meal. We both Order the 2 Meat 2 side combo $10.99 each,We both got Beef Brisket and Ribs, I got St Louis Style no sauce, she got BAbyback ribs, we both got beans which had several kinds of beans and chopped links,brisket and chicken in it, very good. The brisket was very tender & moist , very smoky tasting. The magic Dust is a huge bonus here I love the stuff. The ribs were very meaty, smoked through and very good. The sauce was a liitle sweet. I had mac & cheese which was standard NOT baked, and the potato salad was Standard too nothing special. Service was very fast & firendly as it was slow and most all customers were enjoying the FREE meal from the blood drive. We also enjoyed the fresh rolls they served before the meal. Great meats I will try it more often."}
{"text":"Read many reviews before trying. I decided to, because I'm staying so close. First off, the atmosphere is on par for a BBQ joint. Secondly,  the staff is extremely nice and service was fine. I had Robin wait on me, and she was great. I wasn't  sure about a side and she said to just get it,  and if I didn't like it she would give me something else. Now to the food. I started with the soup of the day,  Rocky Mountain beef soup. It was delicious. Seasoned wonderfully,  full of meat and veggies. My main course consisted of greens, baked beans,  pork shoulder and burnt ends. The burnt ends were nothing too exciting,  and had a lot of pieces of fat. Furthermore,  they weren't burnt ends. Very little bark was visible and lacked seasoning. The pork shoulder was really tender and juicy. I did find that all of the meat was a little weak on the smoked flavor.  The greens were good,  but they do make them sweeter. The baked beans were also good. I only gave it 3 stars due to the amount of fat chunks in my burnt ends, and lack of smoke flavor with no actual burnt ends . They have a few bbq sauces to choose from,  and the spicy is about as spicy as a regular at most places. Overall, not bad. Surprised that the soup was my favorite part. Robin did tell me to make sure and get the ribs next time,  that they are really good."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place?   I stopped in at Memphis BBQ because I was on a lunch break and I've been exploring this new part of town where I'm training for work. I figured I would pop in and just see how long a to-go order would take. Apparently not long... dependent upon what you happened to order. But they have a take-out menu located by the cashier area, so they must get a lot of take-outs anyway. The restaurant seemed quiet to me, but it could have been because it was just a  weird time of the day.  I ended up ordering the \"King\" pulled-pork sandwich, which comes with two sides. I opted for french fries because I have been taking a medication that makes me sick unless I have a really big, hefty meal, and I decided to go lighter with my second side and got the cucumber salad (which the menu says is seasonal). Okay, so I sit back and wait.  My meal comes out fairly quickly in a big styrofoam container and I make my way back to work. When I open my container I am greeted by fries and my sandwich wrapped in tinfoil. When I open the tinfoil... I couldn't have been more disappointed. This sandwich looked like it came slopped out of a school cafeteria - NOT a championship BBQ joint. Oh and the taste was the same. The bun was some horrible white-bread concoction I could get at a cheap company picnic. The meat had no flavor... no BBQ flavor at all! They did give me a container of sauce which I immediately dumped all over the meat, but it didn't have a kick to it... it was just kind of blah. The cucumber salad was not refreshing. It was soaked in a very, very sweet slime-sauce. I felt like I was eating straight-up high fructose corn syrup (and I probably was). The fries were uneventful, just fries, nothing more.  I highly doubt I would give Memphis BBQ another try. I'd probably just go to Famous Dave's if I wanted mediocre BBQ."}
{"text":"Heard this place was good, so we went in and were not disappointed.  The waitress was very friendly and attentive, even though we slid in like 20 minutes before closing.  Ordered the meal for two, that happened to be a special and came with three kinds of meat and four sides.  Took it to go.  Delicious.  The ribs were very tasty, chicken yummy.  The rolls that came with and the honey butter were totally tasty.  The décor of the restaurant was traditional old school bbq.  Red and white check table cloths, chicken wire and tin roofs.  Very cute.  Good food, good service.  Cannot beat that.  I am a fan."}
{"text":"I order burnt end this time and the temperature of the food was still lukewarm.  I love the strawberry shortcake."}
{"text":"We always try to get our Thanksgiving turkey dinner from Memphis BBQ.   It makes things so much easier and hassle free.  Their turkey always comes out moist and smokey and their sides (cream corn, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, gravy, and stuffing) are delicious.  The only negative thing I can say about this year is that they changed up their pumpkin pie to a pre-made frozen type.  I am hoping they bring back their delicious home-made pie next year.   We also add on some extra meats like their brisket, baby back ribs, and sausage links.  All were nicely done!  Thanks Memphis Championship BBQ for always coming thru for us on Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. There's no denying that. But the service... terrible. I had the ribs and the husband had the BBQ platter. Amazing sides of corn and mashed potatoes. I don't know if our bartender was just in a bad mood or just a horrible person but we will not return because of him."}
{"text":"Literally the ribs were dried out , felt like I was eating dried prunes. No  meat in them , you could see theve been cooked over 2x already.  The corn muffins were cold and dull. 1 almost felt like dried out play doll. The service completely sucked. No refills , no sauce. I had to yell for the waitress to come to the table. 2 stars for inside decoration and the brisket,which  was ok."}
{"text":"I ate here once when it was open. The banana pudding was good.  The building has been renovated and is now a Davis Funeral Home."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. Solid BBQ.  Try the Hot Links."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of BBQ until I went here.  The baby backs are so tender and juicy, the fried pickles are tangy and delicious, okra, red beans and rice, collard greens, garlic bread, sweet apple tea....oh my!  The service is fantastic and everyone is really great.  The food is so good that I took a picture to mms friends and family :-)"}
{"text":"Took some friends here from out of town and they liked it a lot. I had the 2 item combo with the ribs and hot links. Everything was tasty and juicy. They now serve breakfast I believe 8am to 2pm on Saturdays and Sundays."}
{"text":"I paid $2.50 for 5 pieces of hush puppies that was too hard.   The sweet tea was delish, perfect for a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Very clean, amazing staff and fun decore. The guys had sandwiches and they disappeared fast. Wasn't much lunch talking. Brisket melts in your mouth. Chili and collard greens were very big hits. Go with an appetite and gotta try the Nachos next. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I met some people here for lunch.  It is a very casual place with a country feel that even has a train-like horn you can pull by the register.  I ordered the sliders so it would give me a sample of items. I got the chicken, beef, and sausage and a side of potato salad. I also got an additional side of greens. Since I am from the south, I couldn't pass up an opportunity to get some greens...I should have passed it up, because I did not like them. It was the first time I had BBQ sauce flavor in greens.  The sliders were decent and the potato salad was good. They also had a tiny side of coleslaw which was vinegar, not mayo, based. I liked it, but many people were disappointed by this.    Not sure I will be back anytime soon, but I do have to give kudos to the waiter.  We had a table of about 10 people and he took the whole order without writing a single thing down, and did not make a single mistake!!! He was awesome!!"}
{"text":"This place is an off-strip place, about 15 min. drive from the strip. Has Southern deco outside as well as inside. The server was super friendly offering deals left & right. We've order 2 combos & 2 kids meals, since there was 5 adults & 2 kids. Server warned us there might be too much food, which was right but we finished most of it. We are a carnivorous people~~ Anyhow place was super cheap with delicious food and customer friendly staff. Will definitely come back & definitely recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Wow!  This place has the laziest people working for them. The food took forever to be delivered. The staff puts very little effort into service. It wasn't as if they were busy. Getting a beer wasn't easy.  My husband ordered a beer with his food.  The waiter didn't bring it until the food was delivered.  I decided to order one with the food and it took over 10 minutes to get it.  After 10 minutes, I walked over to the bar to remind the bar tender that it was ordered.  He was not tending the bar. Maybe the bar tender was pulling double duty with another position, or perhaps he was away doing his side work.  I'm not sure, but after waiting a few minutes for a bar tender to show up, I asked the bus boy if they had a bar tender and if he could find him.  I then asked the hostess if we could have some wipes for our hands to eat our ribs. She handed us a couple of 2\"x2\" packets of wipes. Wow!  What has happened to this place? This was a bad experience."}
{"text":"A group of coworkers and I recently ate here for a team lunch and were able to easily secure a reservation for 10 on a Friday afternoon. The location is right off Craig and Las Vegas Blvd, super close to Nelis AFB. The location itself is decorated as if you're in Memphis itself, very southern and quaint.  Food wise they have a variety of great lunch options at pretty reasonable prices. I decided to go with the grilled chicken sandwich and a side of mac n cheese. I loved the sandwich, the chicken was cooked perfectly and very tasty. The mac n cheese however I felt was pretty bland. I think next time I'd go with a different side.  Overall I'm very happy to find another nice sit down restaurant option for lunch. They also have a drive thru which is a unique option for quick, quality food."}
{"text":"I should disclose that when I ate the food from this establishment, someone had picked it up. So I cannot comment on the service, the restaurant, or anything like that. My commentary is exclusively about the food.  I loved it.   I don't even know what else to say. The cole slaw, which I think is difficult to get just right, was delicious. The ribs were meaty, dripped delicious sauce, and were the most flavorful ribs I've had in the longest time. The chicken, which I only sampled from my friend's plate, was absolutely perfect. It was one of those instances where you eat something so good, and so filling, that you're truly just happy. I mean, it was a lot of food! And it was all so good! Cannot beat that combo!  My only suggestion, other than to make sure you try to ribs, is that you have a ton of napkins available. Or maybe don't scarf it down like I did."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Not the best but good bbq.  Don't waste your $$ on the brisket.  The ribs and pulled pork were good and the sweet potato was delicious."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location in about 5 YEARS. The only reason why I really haven't been back was because this location is a tad far away for me... So, I convinced my friend to give this place a try and omg how much I missed this place!  When we arrived (Friday night) there was not too many people there, although people did keep showing up. Which upset me because this place is awesome.  We ordered for an app the Memphis Sampler Plate which included onion straws, burnt ends and Memphis skins with extra dipping sauce, The King sandwich (pulled pork and cole slaw with hush puppies and macaroni and cheese on the side), and the Southern Catfish entree (with macaroni and cheese and fried okra on the side).  The app was great, the Memphis skins are to die for so I recommend those to anyone, the burnt ends were good too but I got a few fatty bits, and the onions stings were actually onion rings but they were yummy and greasy.  My dinner was The King pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich itself was delicious, and the hush puppies were crispy and fluffy on the inside. My macaroni and cheese was good too, nice and creamy.  My friend ordered the catfish meal, she said her fish was very good and nice and crispy although her macaroni and cheese was definitely not as creamy as mine. It was almost like her serving was the last of an old batch and I got a serving from a new one (compare the pictures). Also, her fried okra was not very good, but our waiter had no problem replacing it with another order of (the new and creamier) macaroni and cheese, so it was all good.   Overall, we had a great experience, the food was delicious and our waiter was outstanding. We even ordered two bottles of their sticky red sauce and a brisket sandwich to go for my boyfriend and he had zero complaints!   My only complaints would be that they have to maintain their restrooms more and I wish this place was getting more business because they are awesome!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Get the sweet apple ice tea, you won't regret it. Decent prices, also recommend the king sandwich but I have never got anything I haven't liked. I just wish they would open up another location in the northwest as they had one at Santa Fe but it closed."}
{"text":"Good Place - deceiving name - I have had memphis style barbeque this is pretty good.  I did not see their smoke pits and I did not smell burning wood so I don't know if they really cook slow and low, but they claim they do.  The best i tried were their burnt ends - stick with the beef here.  Oh yeah tell them not to slather sauce all over your plate.  You do not want all your meats to taste the same."}
{"text":"Table of two. Arrived at 12:00.  Didn't get our food until 12:45. I ended up getting the food to go so I could make it back to work in time. I still tipped waitress too! I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt. I ordered the shredded chicken sandwich, fried okra, and sweet tea. Opened my lunch at my desk only to find plain white shredded chicken on a bun with no tomatoes, lettuce, BBQ SAUCE, or a side of cole slaw (as advertised) I figured my okra would be good because it's kind of hard to mess up okra but was I wrong. It was grease in a bag. There was no breading around the okra it was literally greasy, soggy okra. I took one bite and I was done. I got a refund and the manager handled the situation fine which I appreciated and that's why I didn't give them one star. Maybe a bad day? I don't know but don't care to chance it again."}
{"text":"I've ordered bbq sauce from MCB many times in the past. They used to have great service.  NOT anymore.  Now, they have young management that puts themselves before the great business it once was.   When a boy calls you \"ma'am\" (i.e., \"John\") over the phone and hangs up on you, after you've given him every opportunity to act like a business man and send your dang bbq sauce you ordered over a month ago, women like me crawl through the phone.    Even their web certificate is expired, so it's not safe to input your credit card info through their site.     Don't bother."}
{"text":"This place is just OK. I came here to avoid going to a chain like Lucille or Famous Daves. I regret that decision. My food came out almost immediately after I ordered it and it was lukewarm. A few of my beans were undercooked. The service was fine and fast, but the place overall is mediocre. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"So very disappointed. Nice ambiance. Impressive pedigree but it has been awhile since they were Memphis in May champions.   I had the pork shoulder. Description claimed it was shredded but it was mostly chopped in to small pieces. The meat was moist but it was missing that smokey flavor. Others had the BBQ chicken and burnt ends. Nobody raved about it.   The biggest disappointment was the sides. Mashed potatoes did not seem to be house made and were covered in what seemed to be canned beef gravy. One person ordered chicken. Beef gravy doesn't fit. Hush puppies were overcooked. I had the Mac and cheese and it was clearly from a box. In a BBQ joint, that's completely unacceptable.   The proprietors had a good legacy and they let it go."}
{"text":"The food here is OUT OF THIS WORLD! Tonight I had \"the king\" pulled pork sandwich with Mac n cheese, beans and apple blossom tea! Very delicious!!! The service was very friendly as well"}
{"text":"This place needs better management! We waited over 10 min for someone to greet us and seat us. We ordered our drinks with the appetizers and then our meals. Assuming like all places you would think the appetizers would come out first? Nope it came out all one time with our meals!! I ordered half slab baby back ribs with coleslaw and cream corn, my ribs was super super dry and I didn't like it at all! My son ordered chicken and it was also very dry and not tasty, my husbands food he said was decent. Seeing a sign \"Championship\" you would think it's awesome I think tony Roma's is way better than this place and the ribs are juicy! Not dry! I won't be coming back here again for sure. The waitress was nice. But management if you are reading this?? Don't leave guests waiting over 10 minutes to be seated, and your food needs work! Seems like old food about to go bad!"}
{"text":"Food isn't bad. (I've had Better BBQ) The price is very high. Being from the south I do enjoy their sweet tea."}
{"text":"Sadly I have to write my first bad review.  This place should be ashamed to have the word barbecue in there name. First off i'll start by telling you I am from Kansas City, I know about BBQ, I took my husband and kids here for dinner, we have been dying for some Burnt Ends, the decor is nice the server was friendly and very nice as well but the food is horrid.  Hubby ordered the Burnt Ends \"naked\" no sauce they should be DRY as he has food allergies and has to be careful with spices and sauces.  I ordered the crawfish app and the 4 meat combo to split with the kids.  our order came out and hubby's was covered in sauce, so we let the server know, they went back to remake it.  The meat combo was missing the chicken and we had to ask for it, once it we got the chicken is was very dry and over cooked, as was the shredded pork.  the crawfish was was over salted and dry  Husbands burnt ends finely came out again with sauce so we complained then we were told by the manager \"oh we baste them 3 times in the cooking so there is no way to get them dry, sorry your server didn't know\" WTF BBQ is about the meat and the cooking it is NOT about drowning it in sauce what are you trying to hide about your food? The spices in the sauce are so over powering you can't even taste the meat or anything else after that!  My husband ended up at home with a frozen pizza after what should have been a nice family dinner out!  The mac and cheese? ya its Kraft I can make a whole box at home for less than there $2.25 side dish!   All in all it was a bad expensive experience, the best part of the whole dinner was the sweet apple blossom iced tea, now thats really sad  don't waste your money on this place drive over to North Las Vegas and find H&H BBQ"}
{"text":"We went later in the evning after watching a Food Network show about how this place was supposed to have the best ribs in American. Uhm, I think not! The side dishes were not that great either!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here after trick or treating at the AF base. At first, I was hesitant to try it because it seems dead and ghetto. But we're glad we tried! Sausage is on point! pulled pork and ribs tasted good. Bread and butter so good!! Mashed potatoes, heavenly. Service was friendly and fast. No complaints. Will come back!"}
{"text":"My wife & I visited this place while staying in Vegas.  We LOVED it!  The BBQ is super tender and just dripping with flavour.  The spices and BBQ sauce combination they use is something your taste buds just love.  The bread at the table is \"ok\" nothing special but the BBQ meats are so tender & juicy.  The sides are also very good, I had the BBQ beans that were just the right balance of sweet & spice.   The service we received from \"Carrie\" was nothing short or epic.  She answered all our questions & was always checking on us.  Yea, well be back here as soon as our next visit to Vegas permits."}
{"text":"Cold brisket. Lukewarm chicken. I was starving and decided to pay Memphis a visit for lunch. This used to be a good place to go for lunch and I've ordered a lot of their sliders...2 brisket, 1 chicken from them. My last review in 2013 was a 1 Star review, unfortunately I can't give them a second star this time. I ended up getting sick after eating here and ended up at Walgreens buying Pepto Bismol and missing 2 days of work thanks to their food. It was so bad that this is the first place in a long time that I was tempted to call the SNHD and file a complaint against them.   If you want good BBQ in Las Vegas, this is NOT IT. Do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here. Their quality has went off the cliff, and they don't seem to realize anything's wrong. Which is a shame as they used to be so good. Not anymore. Steer clear of this place...unless you want to end up at Walgreens or CVS and have to choose between liquid or chewable Pepto a couple of hours later."}
{"text":"Let me start this review by saying I don't know what Memphis BBQ is.  I know that it's in the sauce...blah blah blah.    Anyway...the place is cute.  The food is delicious and the staff is fun!  I got the pulled pork and the burnt ends.  Both were good.  No, wait.  Both were very good.  I really enjoyed both and would...wait...will...come back again for more.  The only thing that wasn't exceptionally good was the mac & cheese.  That left me a little disappointed but the rest was totally nom nom!!!  I read the reviews here about the cole slaw and I'll tell you this...when I ordered it, the server warned me right up front that it was vinegar based slaw...not creamy.  I ordered it...it was good....I want more.  So all that being said, I can't compare it to other memphis bbq but as a stand alone place, this is really, really good and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My wife had a buy one, get one coupon in recognition of her birthday so she ordered a full rack of baby back ribs while I ordered pork shoulder.   The ribs were overdone and the pork shoulder lacked flavor.  The sides were hit and miss:  potato salad (too much mayo), baked beans (excellent) and mac and cheese (fair). We are going to take a pass on this offer in the future"}
{"text":"For a championship BBQ place, I was disappointed.  Service wasn't great, servers have to be reminded to refill your drinks.   Food was average at best.  Baby back ribs were dried out, with not so great flavor.  Mash potatoes tasted like I was at Kentucky Fried Chicken fast food joint.  My wife said the same thing, \"big disappointment\"!"}
{"text":"After passing this place up for other bbq places in town, we decided to finally give it a try, reviews aren't great, but we thought maybe we would get lucky. We had a week night dinner, my husband, myself and our two children.  There was no wait for seating, but I wouldn't have minded a few minute wait if it meant we would get a clean table. Instead we got a wobbly table with crumbs on it, empty jar of their \"magic dust\", a black money bag under the leg in a sad attempt to balance it, and scraps of bread and fries underneath it from whomever had eaten there before us. The ac want really putting off cold air, but they have fans circulating the air, making it tolerable, but not completely comfortable. It was not a good first impression. Our waitress was great, very attentive, interacted with our kids, drinks stayed full, and all the staff that happened to pass near our table were kind and friendly. For the food, sweet tea was good, nothing to rave about, but it was good quality tea. My son had the kids chicken and fries, not real chicken breast, more like the frozen processed chicken strips. Fries were ok, not too crispy, but edible. The bread they serve is a basic dinner roll you can buy at a grocery store, probably pulled right out of the package and put on our plate because it wasn't hot. Their Honey butter was delicious though.  My husband ordered the three meat combo, buffalo wings, hot links, and baby back ribs with corn and mac n cheese. He said the ribs were fatty, but ok, wished they had put a bit of a char on the links, the buffalo wing sauce was really hot, he likes spicy food, but these, for him, were the almost couldn't eat them kind of hot, which probably would be enjoyable for some people. His corn was fresh, crisp and delicious, i wish i had stolen a bite, and the mac n cheese was good.  I ordered the two meat combo. I had the burnt ends and the brisket, with veggies and their sweet potato to share with my daughter. Burnt ends were delicious, if you end up eating here, give them a try. The brisket... i could hardly eat it, there was no flavor to the meat, i covered it in bbq sauce, but still couldn't get through more than a bite or two. The potato with brown sugar and butter sauce was good, and the veggies were seasoned well, but definitely were the chopped mixed veggies you buy frozen in a bag, mostly carrots, broccoli was more chopped stalks than the head, and one piece of cauliflower. The seasoning was good enough though, we ate it.  We won't be back to this restaurant, the people were nice enough, but the food just wasn't real quality bbq."}
{"text":"Sides are re fill able ! We shared the mama Faye's down-home supper.  It gives you a choice of one full rack of baby back or st. Louis ribs. With 1/2 lb. pork, beef brisket, 1/2 lb. beef brisket, 1:2 lb. hot links, one whole chicken, black beans, coleslaw, French fries, creamed corn, and rolls for 69.99.  The bread was good because of the butter, the ribs were very dry though, the chicken was very moist and tasty, and the sides were absolutely delicious!  Must try, but I must say that I still like Lucille's better!"}
{"text":"I have never been so amazed by both service and food at a BBQ restaurant as I have been here.   Last week was our first time, and since I hadn't had anything on the menu, I was a bit unsure of what to order. The head waitress (Patricia) who was handling our table made a suggestion of either the Catfish or the Brisket. I ended up choosing the Brisket, and damn was I impressed.  The quality of the meat is very good. It was not greasy at all. I was informed that it's cooked for 18-20 hours before serving, which makes it very tender. Their sauce is also amazing, as well as their \"magic dust\" seasoning.  Drinks were served in mason jars, since we didn't order anything alcoholic. Their apple tea, sweet tea, and lemonade are all very tasty as well.   Top that off with the stellar service we received, and I can honestly say I'll be returning here on a regular basis for dinner. Was VERY affordable, being only $25 for two people to eat."}
{"text":"When I arrived at home from work, hubby had a craving for BBQ and since I am not really a fan of BBQ,  (I would rather grill BBQ myself than eat out), he chose Memphis Championship Barbecue on Rainbow.   We sat in the bar area which was clean, nice and had a couple of flat screens.   Our waiter, (I really should remember our servers' names) pointed out the summer specials on the menu which looked very delicious and affordable. Hubby picked out the 3 rib platter of pork, beef and some other type of rib with coleslaw and beans.  I chose the 2 meats of burnt ends, (ends of some meat and pulled pork with corn on the cob and 3 cheese macaroni. My pulled pork was dry and there were a lot of fatty pieces in the burnt ends.  The corn was great and the 3 cheese macaroni was not bad. Hubby's favorite was the pork ribs, he didn't touch the beef ribs because it looked dry and over done.  Beans were soso, coleslaw wasn't bad. I think they wanted you to drench their branded BBQ sauce over all the meats which I didn't particularly find tasteful.   Now the last time I was here was about 2 or 3 years ago they served great rolls with honey butter.  This time we had to ask for them because the waiter said most people don't eat it if it's served then they have to throw it all out.  In other words they were wasting more rolls.  I gave a star for that.  I don't like wasting food.  The rolls weren't the same ones though... The other star I gave to the waiter and the corn.... I really don't like saying anything bad about a restaurant but we probably won't be there again for a long time."}
{"text":"Pulled pork sandwich - 4 Stars Vinegar BBQ Sauce - 2 Stars lacks in flavor Sticky BBQ Sauce - 4 Stars Good flavor"}
{"text":"This place is out of the way but never really crowed. My bro and I rolled into this place and the service was OK and the food was good. It was a Saturday night and we didn't have to wait. I had a pork special and my bro had a brisket sandwich, both came dry and we added are own sauce. Each had two sides which were really good. I pick up some magic rub on my way out. This stuff is the bomb, i use it all the time on all the meat I cook. I will return when I'm back in Vegas. It doesn't have the Vegas feel at all."}
{"text":"I would to write a review about how awesome the food is here if the staff isn't willing to serve you. My wife and I stood at the please wait to be seated sign for over fifteen minutes with no greeting. The gentleman with the pony tail, both of the servers just stared us down and rolled their eyes. I am sorry but if your job is to be a server you should do it instead of treat people like trash because you're to lazy to do your job. I work at the speedway and I was bring my staff to lunch but not now or ever. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the course of years and enjoy my meal each time. The BBQ is consistently good, and the staff is friendly. Sometimes, the staff can be seemingly super slow, but that seems to be only during the lunch rush. Recently, I was introduced to their soups...Memphis Tomato Soup is so good. And for only $5 for a good sized togo order, it makes a great meal for those times when your stuck at the desk over lunch. Their cornbread is also consistently good. Really, I've had nothing from the menu that wasn't tasty. Definitely a lunch staple."}
{"text":"First waitress gave us away to another server. Her loss as I'm a server and good tipper. The food is not great and the bread doesn't come unless you request it now. The server we had was great but the kids meals came out with rotten apple slices hidden under good slices and the amount of corn dogs were inconsistent. It was my birthday on the last visit so I was there for the pitcher of beer and to hang with my fam. Had a great time and our server wasn't constantly asking how we were doing. He took the kids meals off the check but it was still pretty gross. 5 stars for the waiter but the store has really slipped in the last 10 years. I don't think I'll be going there as often."}
{"text":"First off, this place is GREAT.  Never dissapoints and I have been going there for over 10 years.  Second,  I dont know why you would give a place 3 separate 1 star reviews, just stop going there if its truly (sic) that bad.  Plus when I have had an issue here the management resolved ASAP,and that is rare. I love the ribs and bbq nachos, as well as the sides that are so so good.  Plus the apple tea and you can take it home too!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing championship about this place... Got the brisket... It was dry as F***, the bbq sauce is basically sweet ketchup. Only highlight of my meal was the honey butter they give you for the rolls. You have a better chance goin to famous daves."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and wow what an experience. We came in on a Wednesday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all. Our server Desire was so sweet. She was full of personality and extremely friendly. It's very rare to go to a establishment and see everyone working cohesively but you will see it here. All, and I do mean all of the staff were talking to one another helping one another laughing and enjoying their work environment and you don't see that often. So kudos to management for putting together such a strong team... additionally food is absolutely indisputably AMAZING.  I mean, when you go to a restaurant a bbq restaurant  at that ya kinda don't expect much. Well I know I don't.. believe you me this place will change your mind. Everything was amazing.  Ribs,brisket, sausage, Mac n cheese, red  beans and rice all great. There are very free places in Vegas that I would say are a must and this is probably number two on my list. I will be back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas.  Brisket, Hot Link, Corn on the Cob and Sweet Potato is my favorite meal here."}
{"text":"This place is Outstanding one of the best bbq in vegas, burnt ends are to die for. And you have a drive through for bbq awesome"}
{"text":"pulled pork at it's best, the sweet potato is just tremendous and do not forget to start with some deep fried pickles...service is very good, food come's out pretty fast so be ready"}
{"text":"It was a sunny sunday afternoon and I was craving some baby back ribs! Really bad too. So I decided to try out this one place I've always wanted to go to: Memphis Championship Barbecue.  We walked in and delicious food smell welcomed us. We were seated right away in a booth. They lose one star because our server took more than awhile to finally greet us. By the time she came around to greet us, we were ready to order. I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs and my friend got a sandwich combo (lunch menu). She came back with our drinks and honestly, I was like 'what is this'. They serve drinks in a huge glass jar (empty jam jars, I suppose). I didn't complain. More drinks, less refills. Food came out fairly quickly. My friend's sandwich combo came with a bowl of chili. It was filled with pulled-brisket topped with coleslaw. My friend said it was good. Baby back ribs were also pretty good. Tender, juicy but one thing I didn't like about it was that it wasn't covered with sauce like other places do with their ribs. You have to put sauce yourself and you have four choices: Original, spicy, sweet and sour (I think?), and can't remember the last one at all. But the sauce were delicious and I was happy to finally satisfy my baby back ribs craving.   One interesting thing about this place is once in awhile, you will hear a loud train sound, like you are eating in a train station or something. I flinched pretty bad the first time it happened, but after second and third time, I just thought it was kinda annoying. But anyways, overall, the food was pretty good, i think the service could use a little improvement, but definitely a good place to get some baby back ribs.  Oh yeah, and I've noticed, their beer is pretty cheap and they have happy hour (can't remember what time) so that's also something to remember."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some good BBQ and this place did not disappoint.  The walls and trophy cases were well earned deservedly so.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered the breaded catfish with mash potatoes and macaroni & cheese. There was absolutely no taste to any of the items. Usually I can save a blah catfish by adding lemon and tartar sauce but that was not the case here.  Macaroni & cheese was watered down and seemed like it was the stuff you're forced to eat as a kid when your parents aren't home from work and the only thing you know how to do in the kitchen is boil water. The cornbread muffin was stale and hard. The seating is awkward and noisy.   I'm often disappointed with restaurants that are close to military bases. They get the foot traffic because of the proximity and lack of options but the food is usually mediocre.   I give one star for the yummy sweet tea however I wish I could have my $20 back."}
{"text":"Great Meal overall and great service. We had the sampler for appetizer which was great. Have to try to the burnt ends. My wife and I split the championship platter, which was satisifing. The ribs were awesome, bbq chicken was okay/nothing special, hot links were great and the sides were delicious. Overall, very satisfied."}
{"text":"The service is great and they makes the bombest most awesome nachos I've ever tried, the hamburger I got was simple didn't have all these things in it, but when I took a bite and brought back memories of the 4th of July celebrations I had as a kid. Definitely go there again"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ in the west!    I recommend ordering more than you can eat because it is just as good or maybe better reheated later.  This place is a MUST for BBQ lovers in Vegas."}
{"text":"In one word...horrible...we ordered the BBQ chicken entree which came with two sides. (Cornbread is offered as a side, NOT as part of your meal as you get at Famous Dave's).  We ordered side salads which were fine, but then came the entree...I ordered a buttered sweet potato and green beans as my sides, and my daughter ordered coleslaw and baked beans.  She told the server that she didn't like the taste of the coleslaw ,which was drastically lacking in any kind of dressing, and the server offered a different side to satisfy. That is where the two stars are earned...service was ok. My sweet potato came out lukewarm with a glob of a brown sugar/melted butter mixture plopped on top! I tasted it and ended up scraping it to the side...I've never been served a sweet potato like THAT in my life! Aside from all this so far, the chicken had a dry rub on it which tasted fair, but the chicken itself was totally DRY and hard to swallow. Either it was overcooked OR the chicken was just OLD.  After eating that meal, I can understand why the restaurant was next to empty!  Also, when the server didn't check back to ask how our meals tasted, it gave us food for thought that maybe complaints are more the norm there.  Gave the place another chance after not dining in for years....now I know why we stayed away. Famous Dave's is always great BBQ...I will definitely stick with them, at least they take pride in they're cooking..."}
{"text":"Always nice and give me a huge portion size! Have never left unsatisfied. Brisket, sausage, and st louis ribs are incredible."}
{"text":"Always a great place for my BBQ cravings.  The best sauce anywhere especially the spicy variety"}
{"text":"I was exicited to come here because I had heard good things and I am very enthusiastic about BBQ.  The quality of the meat was not to my standards.  Everything I tried here was substandard.  I felt like everything in the restuarant was in need of a good dusting.  Little too heavy on the kitsch.  I didn't want a box."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. Call for pick up food was ready when I arrived. Well packed and no problems. Thanks"}
{"text":"Okay, not sure if this is the location we went to, but oh well.  Easy to find. Next to a BofA.  The basket of bread you get is pretty good. Bread itself is light and airy, but you have to spread some of that honey butter on it. YUUUUM. Makes all the difference.  I got the full rack of St. Louis. HUGE. This might have been the biggest full rack I've ever had in my life. Meat was tasty, but not the best I've had. Sauce wasn't overly tart or overly sweet, and also not so bold. Maybe people in Vegas like their sauces more mild. I got the mac and cheese - tasty. Green beans - just alright. Too much butter and it was sitting in all this liquid. Not too much flavor either. Wouldn't recommend this.  I tried parts of hubbys variety dish with brisket, hot link, pulled pork and chicken. All were average. I enjoyed the brisket the most. Hot link was a little too hot for my taste. Bulled pork was more like butchered pork because it was just too too shreded. Chicken was regular chicken.  Coleslaw was probably the best side that I tasted. It's not the creamy kind, but the vinegar kind. Light and very tasty.  Server Dan was super duper friendly.  I don't think this place is the best I've tried, but I'm glad I had a chance to have a taste Memphis bbq Vegas style."}
{"text":"I'm going to excuse the rude hostess when I called for directions and just focus on the food...  Our server was extremely nice...to the point she was thanking us for thanking her.  The food was pretty good. I was most impressed with the fried okra and red beans and rice with bits of hot links in it.   My wife liked the smoked chicken a lot. Her hot links weren't bad either.  The waitress raved about their club sandwich, but I didn't think it was all that. I wanted the pulled pork sand or the prime rib sand, but she insisted on the club so I got it. Bad move on my part. She was skinny so I shouldn't have trusted her.  I'd go back again and order something else. They can't get a 5 in my book though because their portions aren't that big...they should visit Lucielle's."}
{"text":"Seems like there isn't a strict food consistency going on with this joint. When it's good, it's good. When it's bad, it really sucks. That's unacceptable. It's apparent seeing the reviews being half food and half bad.  Unfortunately, mine will be a bad one. I didn't go to the restaurant but my BF, his mom and grandma did and brought back food. Okra good highlight for them and that really was it. The meats were of good quality but it's wasted by not cooking it right. It was dry and so smoky, it definitely tipped me off that someone heavy handed liquid smoke. I thought this was supposed to be naturally smoky with wood chips? I'm a cook and this was not natural tasting and overly abundant. I smelled my liquid smoke bottle and the takeout box- same smell.   I would like to see their BBQ at it's finest, the reason why they won awards but without a consistency- I don't think I can stomach going back until it's a good night. I'd rather go to Famous Dave's to get a decent meal. Not the best I've had, but at least there I can see where it might've deserved an award. It probably is nothing like the champion owners cooking but it at least is a chain that is holding a standard.   I guess the \"Best of Vegas BBQ restaurant\" will stay as an empty category for me... Hopefully only for now. I wanted to like this place, but skipping out."}
{"text":"I Went here for Memorial Day. I thought it would be full but there was only four tables full.  I think that they have changed their standards. The food wasn't as good as I remembered it.  The sweet potatoes are small and the pulled pork wasn't as juicy.  I hope they can change so It doesn't close down like the one in Charleston."}
{"text":"Was invited here from one of our software vendor during a visit to Vegas and this was the place we decided to go.    Food was ok, I picked the pull pork and baby back ribs combo with fries and collard greens.  Pull pork was ok, not as tender as expected and a little tough, flavor was ok, added more sauce to enchance the flavor.  The baby back ribs was ok too, was not as tender as expected also.  Was surprised the order came out so quickly and the food was lukewarm.  Service was quick and friendly, restaurant had a \"classic\" BBQ look.  Portions were ok.  I think there are other choices to consider in Vegas."}
{"text":"one of my favorite places to eat.  I love the nachos here, it is the only place I've ever been too where they put more toppings then chips.  I always have to ask for a second plate of chips.  For $9 it is a great meal. The creamed corn is the best I've ever tasted, the two sides are both creamed corn.  Some of the best ribs in Vegas.  When ever we have friends from out of town and they ask to eat out this is always in the top three suggestions."}
{"text":"Not sure about  \"championship\" but maybe I'll go top five.....ribs had good smoky sauce and had a lot of meat but were a bit over done.  Beans were good, and I liked the coleslaw.  But the hot links were mild at best, maybe not 5 alarm hot, but something with a little more zip to it.  I'm not a big sweet tea fan but theirs is always cold, served in those cool mason jars and is just right, my server said try the apple next time.  Oddly it was the only thing she recommended out of the whole menu, maybe she knew something?"}
{"text":"Good, solid barbecue joint.  Their ribs and their pulled pork were delicious - definitely the stars of my plate.  I really love that they offer choices of sauce so that you can enjoy your bbq more on the sweet or more on the sour side or even with no sauce, if you like.    I went last month, and though I remember enjoying my sides, I don't remember what they were.  So I guess that means they were good but not better than the meat.  I wasn't a huge fan of their deviled eggs - a little too vinegary for my taste.  I enjoyed their sweet tea, and my coworker was ready to write love notes to his strawberry lemonade.  The wait staff was friendly - not the fastest service in the West, but not painfully slow either.  All in all, a positive barbecue experience.  I'd return."}
{"text":"I don't have the desire or energy to write a very long review for this place.  Long story short.. Super slow service & nasty food. The sides tasted store-bought & like they had been sitting around for a few hours before being served to us. Hubby held his mac n cheese upside down & the stuff never moved!! The baby back ribs were bland & fatty & the pulled pork was so dry. No amount of BBQ sauce could have saved it.  Ugh, SO far off the mark. I hate wasting our hard earned money on crap food. Should have known better when I noticed their so called awards above the front entrance were from the 90's.. Maybe it's time to drop the \"championship\" from the name?!"}
{"text":"Poor service, and mediocre quality food. On my way out I also noticed a \"C\" rating from the Health Dept. Unfortunately, this place was a huge let down!"}
{"text":"Being from eastern NC, I have pretty high standards for pork barbecue.  We had been to LA and then Vegas and were seriously missing sweet tea, so they hooked us right away with the 32-oz mason jars.  We had the fried pickles and onion straws combo basket for an app, it was delicious and plentiful for 2 people, we couldn't even finish it.    I had the pork shoulder with mashed potatoes and collards.  The portion of pork was large and tasty, not the best BBQ I've ever had, but it was satisfying none-the-less.  The meat is not overly-seasoned, so they add their own sauce on top.  I would have preferred that they let me choose the sauce, but BBQ cooks are picky about what they put their name on, and this was their brand, so I played along and ultimately was not disappointed.  BBQ lovers know that everyone has their own recipe and I am glad to try them all.    Being a picky southerner, I was hesitant to order the collards, just didn't think anyone in Las Vegas could cook them, if they'd even heard of them.  While I think they may have started with canned collards, they dressed them up in bacon and I was quite surprised how good they were.  The mashed potatoes were standard.    Service was fast and friendly, although there was one waitress constantly bitching at the kitchen staff and other servers, but she wasn't ours.  I'm guessing she is either the boss or related to the owners, as the staff seemed to be putting up with her."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. We ordered the catfish, baked potato, macaroni and muffins. Normally the muffins are the only thing I eat and they are delish, but the last few times they have been stale & rock hard. The catfish was super soggy and the two hush puppies were burnt to a crisp. The potato was, well, just a potato. The sweet tea was great. The people are always nice but the food, especially on this day, was beyond despicable."}
{"text":"It is a great barbecue place due to location!  It is nice to have such a close spot to eat barbecue. I recommend buying their Apple sweet tea!  It's probably the BEST thing they have."}
{"text":"at one point I remember how Memphis used to be busy with lots of bbq lovers. the problem is now their product doesn't even hold up with the rest of them. you can tell because when you come in here the energy is dead and the people that wait on you have probably been working here so long that when a big party comes in they get all happy and surprised. I'm not going to really post a review on the food because we all know about ribs and brisket and pulled pork. do yourself a favor guys when it comes to bbq there's so many better options than this place whoever says that this is the place for bbq really doesn't know their stuff or must be on something.. I will say that do not and I repeat do not order salads here or their red beans and rice because it was garbage. the vegetables weren't fresh at all. if you walk in here as well they don't leave their A/C on so it's kinda hot in here. tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt because a couple of my family members but will never come back"}
{"text":"I took the time to drive to what I was told was a great BBQ place, after one experience here I won't be back . I had to gnaw through a rack of baby back ribs the consistency of jerky , with hardly any sauce to speak of, and when I asked for extra sauce what they game did not taste as good as the BBQ sauce I dip my nuggets in at \"insert fast food chain here\". Even the rolls were stale,the highlight of my meal was the sweet potato which a 3 year old could master the cooking off..."}
{"text":"I am a barbecue snob - from the heart of barbecue (North Carolina) where I get both styles (Eastern barbecue - vinegar based and Western barbecue - tomato based)  So, had to at least try Memphis Championship Barbecue during my recent visit to Vegas.  Truth in advertising - I stopped by for a late dinner about 30 minutes before closing which may account for the review that follows.  I had the 2 meat combination platter consisting of pork and \"burnt ends\" which is brisket that is generally double smoked with the sides of vinegar based coleslaw and baked beans with hushpuppies and rolls.  The pork was acceptable, nothing exceptional.  The burnt ends left quite a bit to be desired.  They were dry and tough - not what I expect from my barbecue.  Coleslaw and beans were tasty and hushpuppies were fair.  So my meal wasn't quite as good as I would have liked, but getting the meal right before closing might have had something to do with that.  I would give them a try again, but would ensure it was during the main dinner hour so there could not be any excuses for the meat."}
{"text":"We've lived basically across the street from this spot for almost a year, but we always seem to forget that its there.   The other day, after work, neither my husband nor I felt like cooking, and we REALLY didn't want to order pizza again.    My husband remembered Memphis BBQ, and said \"Why don't we order from there?\"  So, we looked at the menu, and decided to order for pickup.  We had:  The brisket sandwich with collard greens and mac n cheese,  The catfish sandwich with potato salad and mac n cheese.  Everything was delicious!  The fish was cooked to perfection, served with a really good tartar sauce, lemons, and a little container of their vinegar slaw.  (I put that on top of the sammich.)   The brisket was sooooooooo tender, but a tiny bit dry...but after putting some of their incredible BBQ sauce on...my husband couldn't eat it fast enough.  I had to fight him for a bite.    The sides were really good too.  The only thing we weren't super pleased with were the greens.  They were ok, but super super spicy.  The mac n cheese was magical, and the potato salad tasted like my aunt's.    Prices are really good too.  $21 for 2 good sized, delicious sandwiches, and 4 sides?  I'll take it.    We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Another BBQ review from a girl who hates BBQ. What can I say, I keep getting dragged to these establishments! This place was better than others I've had for sure. We tried the platter with just about everything on it. The ribs were good, but not amazing. My personal favorite was the pork shoulder (pulled pork). WOW, I can't wait to try this on a sandwich ! Also, I do enjoy the vinergary sauce they use here. It's yummy.   Happy hour specials (3-6 and 9-close) were awesome.. 3 sliders (with that yummy pork on it) + fries + a pint for 6.99! Wow, I'll wait till 9 PM next time. Drink prices were good in general.. $4 stella anyone?"}
{"text":"Amazing Memphis style food!! Laid back atmosphere. And the fact that they cater and have banquet space is a plus. Must Check out and form your own opinion. Ask for Brandon. Best service I've had in a while!!!"}
{"text":"We used to come to this place frequently when they'd opened. The food was great, the atmosphere was nice, and the service was always generally good.  Fast forward 18 years though and it is a different story.  The food is just ok.  The service has always been good, especially by Sean, who genuinely seems to like his customers.  The problem with Memphis Championship Barbecue is that they have not repaired, updated, or given this restaurant the TLC needed. The booths are ruined with springs coming out of the seats. The bathroom isn't necessarily dirty, but it is very rundown.  Ownership needs to renovate desperately, or just give up and close the doors.  My kids love this place and every time we are on this side of town, they want to go there, but I have gotten to the point that I don't want to come here anymore.  I give this 3 stars because the service is generally so good, but the food and restaurant need an update."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas with some friends I knew liked BBQ. I've eaten here before and it was pretty good.  We started with some fried pickles, they were tasty, the full order is pretty big.   2 friends ordered the mini sliders, they have a variety of choices, and you pick 2 sides. They both liked them and liked the meats they chose. The sausage was a little too hot for my friend, it was OK for me.  Another friend ordered the St. Louis ribs which she liked.  I ordered the 2 item, St. Louis ribs and burnt ends. I loved the burnt ends which are tips of the brisket. The pieces were all fresh and moist, some brisket can be dry, which I really don't like. The sauce is different on the tips. The ribs were OK, not tender as I hoped, not tough, but I think they weren't freshly cooked. I think they were maybe from the day before, the meat wasn't smoked looking and juicy like my friend's. The BBQ sauce on the tips is the sticky sauce, which we all preferred over the sauce they have on the tables, which is watery and not that flavorful.   Our server, Dana, was very nice and spent lots of time taking a picture of our group. She checked with us regularly, but not too often, and was cheerful, like she enjoyed her work. She was helpful and could answer the questions about the menu, not very common now days.    I like there food, good BBQ is hard to find. The prices are reasonable too."}
{"text":"I had the brisket which had very little flavor and was not tender at all. I fact the meat was chewy. Very disappointed!!! The table behind me had ribs and complained that they were not even warm and were tough. The sides were okay....i will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"If southern, vinegar based \"Q\" is your desire this place is awesome (for the most part). Their brisket is hands down AMAZING with perfect red bark and it's oh so tender and their ribs are world champions apparently. The hostess had a bad attitude but the waitress made up for it with hers, and the mac n' cheese was sad (from a box and fake as it gets). Otherwise the food was wonderful and the atmosphere is a fun tribute to the south with old pictures, barbecue awards and road signs on the wooden walls. All their meat was cooked perfectly and although I like my \"Q\" a little on the sweet side the flavors on everything were wonderful. I'd highly recommend this place for a gathering off the Vegas strip to anyone in town... and if you're too tired to dine in apparently you can also use the drive through!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch. Carrie is the BEST!!! She always keeps our glasses full & makes sure we have everything we could ever need!   My friend had a beef brisket sandwich that was a little dry, Carrie sent it back & recommended something even better. We never feel uncomfortable asking her for anything, shes very accommodating.   Lunch was good per usual, nothing like some yummy brisket & sweet potatoes to kick start my day!  Memphis isn't my favorite BBQ place in town, but we keep coming back because of the prices & the awesome service!"}
{"text":"The burnt ends, brisket and ribs were very delicious and the hot rolls were amazing. Apple Tea was fantastic. Server was very quick and polite. One of our favorite BBQ places to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered a big dinner meal for pick up, when got home right after pick up - food was cold and the whole ordrr was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  I use to enjoy going to Memphis Championship once a upon a time.   Now it's once a year. C'mon Memphis get the Championship back. 1. Corn Bread was dry and brittle (seem old) 2. Skins one piece was eaten 3. Meats all had to go into oven to heat up 4. Not enough BBQ sauce on side 5. Rolls were ok,  were better than Corn Breads that I had ordered as side order 6. Cream corn flavor wad good,  but corn was horrible 7. No one cared for the BBQ Beans 8. Alot of what we had went to waste; BBQ in our house never gets wasted"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of fried chicken, so when I found out Memphis does a special Fried Chicken dinner on Sundays and Mondays, I put it on the list and whined to my husband about how we had to go. He finally broke down. The price was great, $10.99 for all you can eat with 5 different sides. I was kind of bummed I didn't get choice of sides...most of them I wasn't crazy about. The Fried chicken question is answered...it was okay, nothing special, not juicy enough, I like my chicken crispier, but it had lots of flavor. So I wouldn't go back for the fried chicken. Still love their rolls, mac and cheese and hushpuppies, which my husband agreed to share with me since I didn't like my coleslaw (Not a fan of vinegar based slaw) or green beans (mushy)."}
{"text":"I've eaten at ALOT of BBQ places in my day & I have to say this one is by far my favorite. Each and every time I've dined there the food is always amazing and hot and they give you so much food there is always a to go box needed. I recommend this place to anyone in search of a great meal. Staff is friendly you can tell this restaurant is Managed very well. Kudos to this place it will always have me running back for more !"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for at least 8 years. I am never dissapointed with my meal. We almost always order fried pickles and two meat combos. This was my sons first place where he tried ribs and he's been a rib lover since!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ even better price.  Had lunch here last week and wonder why it took me so long to find this place.  Been to Vegas many times, so glad Memphis BBQ was recommended.  I was with a group of about 12.  I had the burnt ends and pulled pork.  I loved them both.  Our waitress was fantastic and took care of our every need.    After paying ridiculous prices for meals in Vegas it was refreshing to find a place with large portions, great flavor, and a low price.   I highly recommend Memphis BBQ."}
{"text":"Usually have great things to say about this place but tonight ruined it for us. Monday night walked right in, no wait so that was nice. Got seated in a booth like we asked. All down hill from there. We were one of 4 tables. It took 15 minutes to get drinks, then the server got them wrong. We ordered right away, very simple meals. 2 burgers and an app. She totally forgot about our appetizer until we said something when our burgers arrived. Never got checked on once. When we were done with our food we had to grab the hostess to get our check. Worst service I've ever had. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"It's been YEARS since I have been to MCB.  After yesterdays lunch, it might be a few more!  The good was the presentation.  The cook knows what they are doing.  The bad:  First a 2 meat combo, and you have choose 2 different meats?  I guess they need to save money wherever they can.  God knows they won't get more of mine.  The place wasn't busy, and I know why.  The server seemed to have a bit of an attitude, and God knows who would have to sleep with to get a refill in that place!    I love GOOD barbecue, and service.  I might as well go to Lucille's. MCB is living proof that you get what you pay for,  There's no bargain, and not much that is redeeming about this place.  They were so good 20 years ago, but that was then, and it sucks now!"}
{"text":"Not really a fan although I keep giving it the ole college try!  I mean...  I really really want to like it. I mean... Hello? They are super close to my house and they even have a super convenient drive thru. Not to mention all of the awards they have won. It's just not great. Don't get me wrong... It's ok. Just not wanting me to come back for more.  About every six months or so I end up back. That's about when the memory of the disappointment of the last experience is but a mere memory. That's what happened again tonight...  In an emergency last minute situation, I found myself house/dog sitting for a friend in my neighborhood. So I found myself wanting a substantial meal yet after a long day at work I didn't particularly wanna try to navigate a foreign kitchen.  So for the pure sake of convenience I found myself running through their drive thru.  It's obvious it had been awhile and the regret from last time had faded.   I was overly zealous and ordered  three meat combo so that I would have enough to bring to work for lunch the next couple of days. I got the baby back ribs, pulled pork and brisket. For sides I ordered collard greens and the mac n cheese.    So let's start with the highlights shall we???  Mac n cheese was solid. Nothing particularly memorable but still delish. Baby back ribs were also pretty tasty and tender.. What really stood out was the collards. They weren't the watery/funky/musky that are found at most places. They had a great balance of vinegar without going overboard. Pleasant surprise!  Pulled pork... Decent. Also not memorable.  Brisket... Blah. Dry dry dry. Even when doused with sauce. Let's just say that part of tomorrow's planned lunch went to the dogs I'm sitting.  Will I go again? Probably at some point when the memory fades to black again. Just because of the pure convenience of the proximity and the drive thru. If I have time to sit down, not so much."}
{"text":"This is a good BBQ place that serves a good brisket.   I usually go for sausage and brisket while my husband is the rib eater.  I grew up in Texas and ribs must fall off the bone, so I do not find too many places here in town that meet that criteria, so I usually will try his.  This place also has a unique item for appetizers, fried pickles, if you haven't tried them before, they're not bad.  Overall, the meats had a good smokey flavor, the ribs were tender, but just not Texas perfect, but close. The sides of cole slaw and collard greens were also very good.  I recommend this place, overall, not a bad BBQ."}
{"text":"Sadly, the most recent reviews seem to indicate MCB is on the decline.  I used to LOVE this place.  It was my \"go to\" BBQ restaurant in Vegas.  When I worked down the street, I ate lunch there 3-5 times a month, sometimes more.  When they closed the one near my house, I looked forward to trips across town as a chance to sneak in lunch at MCB.  No more. Likely, never again.  The burnt ends were dry and sugary. The brisket was tough. The pork shoulder was a wet mess. The mac and cheese was gummy and dry. The sweet rolls were stale and cold. And, the fried pickles, a personal favorite, were burned and greasy.    The only things that were as I remembered were the apple sweet tea and cinnamon sugar butter for the rolls.  Making matters worse, everything cost more and the portions were smaller.  I might have been OK with this if the quality was there, but it was not.  It is a sad day for BBQ fans in Vegas."}
{"text":"Meh....went on a Saturday afternoon.  Slow service first of all.  Food was ok nothing special and I ordered to go (for work) 2 orders corn muffins.  They brought them - COLD!  I doubt I'll be back any time soon....step up your service!!"}
{"text":"A family favorite. We visit here quite frequently when we want to get the whole group together, because we love the atmosphere and my grandparents are friendly with many of the waiters. I usually get the fried catfish meal, and I often have enough left for an entire plate the next day! The prices are not too bad, especially considering how much food you get."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night and we both ordered the combo with 2 choices of meat and 2 choices of sides, $16.99 per order. I picked the st Louis ribs, beef links, coleslaw, red beans w/ rice and strawberry lemonade. Wife picked chicken bbq, pork shoulder bbq, fries, steamed veggies and water.   Theyre all mouthwatering juicy delicious and with their memphis sauce added to it makes it even better and surprisingly the orders came in quick. Only thing is my wife's chicken bbq was a little dry, she didnt like it so a finished them. Per order for the combo meals is pretty big, and you have to be a huge person to finish the whole plate. We ended up boxing the rest of them. You have to try the strawberry lemonade!  Bottom line: My favorite was the st Louis ribs out of all of the items that me and wife ordered."}
{"text":"Place has really good BBQ, probably the best BBQ I've found in Vegas, which is in itself surprising.  Service is always spot on, place is clean, they have a fireplace going when it's cold outside, and the food comes out really fast! So it's a great spot for a quick lunch.  I typically get the roasted chicken, baked potato, and/or collard greens. Depends on how hungry I am, but I never finish it. I typically only finish half and take the other half home.  Their smoked turkey and brisket are both really good as well.  They don't have as many bbq sauces as Famous Dave's, which I would prefer they did, but the 2 they have are pretty good.  Lastly, try the apple flavored unsweetened tea, mmmm mm good!"}
{"text":"good competition que, probably the best in the competition realm I have ever had but not like authur bryants or Gates or any of the other bbq joints  I had the beef brisket(what I judge all BBQ on) and burnt ends both I had to cover in sauce by the end but still a good taste"}
{"text":"Having been born and raised in Texas, I know barbecue.  With an intro like that, you know that I am ready to throw down on this review, but it's true.  It's been a while since I've had decent barbecue.  I lived in California for a while, and they don't \"get\" barbecue.  I found one place in San Diego that was alright, but now I'm going off on a tangent, so back to my point.  I'm a little wary of West Coast barbecue offerings.  I've been burned too many times, so I was hesitant on going here, but they are bonafide.  It's solid fare with big portions, and a good amount of taste and flavor.  From three visits, I tried their BBQ sliders of various meats, their Gulf Coast shrimp, and their turkey.  Each is full of flavor, and tasty, and their \"Magic Dust\" added a good amount of \"kick\"  to my meal, though I question the validity of the \"magic\" aspect, as no tricks accompanied my meal, nor did I get an invitation to Hogwarts to sample said magic.   I noticed some other reviewers seemed to have some \"off\" nights, but my experiences were all positive.  Good waitstaff as well.  I am also a sucker for their fried pickles.  Again, the words \"Southern\" and \"fried\" go hand in hand, but these are a quite tasty.  I must admit that I have to cut back on them, however.  While addicting as everything, they didn't sit entirely well with my tummy, which is an epic tragedy in itself.  To be denied pickles is to be denied a great reward.  But I'm sure you'll enjoy them, dear reader.  It's good food.  I'd recommend it, and will go there again.  I just hope I don't ever encounter the bad luck that has apparently befallen other readers here."}
{"text":"Damn this is some good BBQ!  Mr. Mike Mills is a god...have his book \"Peace, Love & Barbeque\" and couldn't wait to try one of his restaurants.  I've been here twice when visiting Las Vegas.  Last time I took some friends with me and they acted like I had just shown them to the promised land.   The sauce is my favorite thing about MCB.  It's a perfect mix of ketchup based and vinegar based.  And being a North Carolina BBQ lover I can appreciate the vinegar.  Overall, everything is good here.  I can't point to one thing really.    Order one of the combos and at the very least get what I call the trifecta (ribs, chicken, BBQ (pulled pork)).  The only thing that may disappoint you is that the greatest server in the world, Victoria, may no longer be there, but if she is, she'll take good care of you.  Make sure to get some sauce and Magic Dust to go!  Num, num...get some."}
{"text":"The only good tasting food here is the pulled pork sandwich, everything else is poor. I am from the east coast where we have BBQ cook offs and such, so I know good BBQ. This place does a poor job in my opinion. Friendly waitresses/servers and good sweet tea but that's about it."}
{"text":"Love the tea and biscuits with honey butter. Nice servers. Good bbq. I suggest the ribs with sticky sauce.   I will defenitely come back for more"}
{"text":"This place just get weirder and weirder every time we come. The first time we came in was because we saw Mike Mills on the travel channel and we had to try this place. The food WAS excellent! The first place I have ever tried burnt ends and they were the best and their smoked turkey was so delicious. But over time they started changing things.. not so much on the menu but the way they prepare the food. The turkey has changed not bad but not how it was. Oh! and the burnt ends! They have completely butchered them! It used to be that they cut the ends off of the brisket and put them back in the smoker with additional sauces and magic dust for more flavor and over time you can taste the difference. They don't put them back in the smoker. They are tougher and taste like they have been sitting in a warm tub of barbeque sauce. As a matter of fact all of the smoked meats taste like they are not smoked well at all they all lack the flavor and it is highly disappointing. We have been coming here a couple times a year for the past 5 years and it is just not the same. The staff lacks professionalism as well. The last time we were in a nice lady was about to seat us when another employee came over with a baby and forced the lady that was walking us to our table to hold the baby so she can seat us (AWKWARD!) Our server was rude, he was short with us and would walk by tossing our bread and plates as he walked by as if he was busy.. the restaurant was not busy at all and even so if it was there is no excuse for throwing dishes on the table. I really hate to say this but I don't want to come back. Mike Mills should be disappointed to have this happen to a place of his."}
{"text":"I came here today for some collard greens. They changed the recipe and they SUCK. They're sweet and don't even taste like collards at all. Whatever you order do not get them. On a positive note. The beer was cold and the bartender was super nice. Her name was Shelly, she was very attentive and really took care of me."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here all the time! Tonight was no different we decided to go here for date night. We ordered the beef brisket and it was cold! Mine wasn't even cooked properly my brisket was so pink I could taste the blood. Our waitress came by to ask how the The food was and I told her how my food was not cooked properly and she slammed the basket she was holding and said that's impossible our brisket is cooked 18 hours in the slow cooker and it depends on how much fat is on the brisket. As she is telling us this she is leaning on the table and just being rude. My boyfriend and I ended up not finishing our food."}
{"text":"I give this BBQ place 3 stars because I feel they can do so much better on food quality and preparation. The staff is amazingly friendly, but the food is dry, stale at times, and just not what I'm use to as far as BBQ. Can I get some juicy flavor or what? Again staff is amazing."}
{"text":"Frustratingly inconsistent.  I know Mike Mills (not the REM bassist, sadly) is like the Alain Ducasse of BBQ. And there have maybe been like two times that I've eaten at Memphis Championship and kind of got a glimpse of what the fuss is all about - but the thing is, I've been there about seven or eight times.  When the pulled pork actually tastes like smoke, it's a revelation - but half the time it's bland and stringy. Their baby back ribs were probably the driest, least tender ribs I've ever had at a 'que joint. Thankfully, the Magic Dust is legit - frankly the best part of eating Memphis Championship BBQ. It's not the sauce, it's not the meat, it's not the smoke - it's the dust.  As for the all-important BBQ sides, the onion straws are addictive, and the fried dill pickles are awesome so long as you get to them before the inside of the pickle soaks through the breading. None of the other sides that I've tried really stand out.  Their sweet tea is pretty off the hook though - I think they use apple blossom honey in it or something. It's like crack.  I dunno. Maybe Mike Mills needs to come into Vegas and whip his kitchen into shape - because a place with this much hype around it and such a big name behind it - should be better."}
{"text":"The plan for the night was to go out with a couple of our friends and grab some dinner and then hang out. Just like every other time you start making plans for dinner we started out him hawing around and not really knowing where we planned on going until someone threw out Lucille's in the district. Yes, I completely understand that is a chain but at the same time they have awesome food and great sweet tea. As the waiting began some plans changed and we ended up deciding that we would go to Memphis Championship BBQ.   Walking into this place is like walking into an old country setting which I obviously understand since it a BBQ joint but the place was dead. This didn't make too much sense to me since from what I have heard it is \"THE\" best Barbecue in town.... Our table ordered a few different appetizers to start. The Fried Pickles, Hot link and smoked Cheese and the Onion strings. The appetizers were good, the fried pickles stand out in the bunch but then comes the meal. Now to be honest I was let down by the menu choices, particularly the sides, it was really run of the mill. Green beans, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. After deciding on the 2 meat combo Burnt ends and pulled pork shoulder I settled for Mac and cheese and steamed veggies as the sides.   Now for the meat and potatoes of this review, no pun intended. The waitress came to the table with our meals and the first thing that popped into my mind was, \" for the price this is pretty chintzy\"  when I think BBQ I think large portions, sauce all over the place, Tangy Spicy goodness and unfortunately in this case It was the complete opposite, small portions, lacking sauce and overall flavor. My Burnt end which looked like a small pile of beef jerky nuggets could not me much more dry so I attempted to see if they had any buoyancy and floated them in the BBQ sauce that is on the table. As for the pork shoulder, well it was pulled pork shoulder with a splash of sauce in the middle of the pile, it was definitely lacking.   I can deal with bad BBQ meat, it is a matter of just covering it in BBQ sauce and covering the flavors but the sides which are supposed to be like the back up singers are to lady gaga were much more like the closing of the coffin for the place. The steamed veggies looked and tasted as if they do a daily steaming and just serve them all day until they run out, wilted and dry and terrible flavor and the mac and cheese was just eh.   From everything I have read about this place it sounds like it may have been the king pit in town at one point but over time some things tend to change, and this must be one of them because i honestly think taking a seat and the table of famous Dave would be a better option at this point, this is sad because of the history this place seems to have in the BBQ industry here in Vegas and well.... It was my first and last trip here."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  The cole slaw is to die for and not the normal, KFC crappy stuff you usually get..  The sausage sandwich?  Exquisite!    My husband had the barbecued burger with beans and fries and was in awe.  He said the beans were incredible.  I had the sausage sandwich with creamed corn and fries.  The creamed corn was unique and actually wasn't the canned creamed corn that I expected.  It was fantastic!    I love the choice of BBQ sauces on the table too.    I would have given this five stars, except for one thing -- the country music being played!  I suppose that goes with the atmosphere, but since I can't stand that type of music, it was a turn off.    Maybe I'll make this a take out place, and make it a five star dinner every time."}
{"text":"Got some plate with 5 meats.  Baby backs, pulled pork, brisket, burnt ends and sausage.  Bb, pp, and brisket were all decent, not bad, not great.  The burnt ends were not that great, they were mushy, like the shredded pork, they should be burnt with a little crunch to them i think.  The sausage was the best part, very good.  I got the corn on the cob which was very good, and also got the mac and cheese, which was terrible, didnt even eat half of it, too much sauce, no breadcrumbs....very plain.  The bbq sauce is nothing to write home about.  I wouldnt come back since there are a lot of other bbq places id like to try around here"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place when I moved here but it seems like these days that everything is decent here BUT the ribs.  The smoked buffalo wings are great as is the smoked turkey and most of the sides.    But the ribs are the bread and butter of any decent bbq restaurant and these ribs just aren't worth paying for anymore.  Get anything else but the ribs!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was excellent.  The wife and I have hit up quite a few bbq places and this is probably are favorite.  Highlights for us include the spicy smoked wings, the best smoked turkey ever (just ask to get the gravy on the side), baby back and the sweet potato side (the brown sugar on it makes it soooooo good!!).  I wished they had a deeper beer selection like Pabst and Natty light but that's about it."}
{"text":"At one time my family would visit this restaurant at least once a month. It was my favorite place to eat. Over the past several years I've noticed the quality has slowly diminished. After eating a dry, old Turkey dish for lunch last week I've decided I will no longer frequent this establishment. Over the past few months I have been served food that appears to have been stored in a refrigerator for several days. When I dine out I expect the food to be freshly cooked. They are cutting corners and it shows."}
{"text":"Having eaten here about 5 times (3 drive throughs), I must say Memphis does not disappoint. Every single time, I've been happy with what I ordered - chili, ribs, pulled pork sandwich, cole slaw, etc Don't know why there are bad reviews, maybe I just got lucky? It helps that this is right across the wide street from where we work-very convenient. Sorry 'bout the other folks that must've caught it on a bad day. Anyway, now that we're Las Vegans who love meat ;-), Memphis is just fine by us....."}
{"text":"I really really hated the baby-back ribs here.  I just didn't like the flavors against the pork, but it might work better with the beef ribs.  Because of the restaurant.com certificates I may come here again for a cheap meal.  The sides, except maybe the french fries also weren't very great."}
{"text":"Good food, fairly good service. I go there once every few months for some brisket or chicken. I love that their water and drinks comes in mason jars. Their homemade sauces and rubs make the place good as well."}
{"text":"Contrary to the bad reviews, I love this place! Great food, gets service and great prices. Variety of choices. The brisket is my fave! I prefer the Sticky Red Sauce over the Original Memphis brand BBQ sauce. Great atmosphere. Anytime I visit Vegas, I stop by for their down home BBQ!"}
{"text":"Their loaded potatoes with pulled pork is pretty much awesome. I think this place should definitely be rated higher than three stars. Good food for a good price."}
{"text":"This place has been great in the past but no more. We waited 45 minutes to get our food after ordering and there were only 3 other tables in the place.       The grilled chicken sandwich texture was like rubber, much like a frozen chicken breast taste after cooking quickly. In addition it was covered in seasoning and that didn't help the taste.    The pulled chicken sandwich was fine on top but when getting further to the bun there was a layer of oil to the point the bun was saturated.    Don't know what happened but will not return. Looking at the reviews in the past year it looks like this is not an isolated issue"}
{"text":"I used to think Memphis/Warm Springs had the finest BBQ in LV. After my two most recent visits, my opinion has changed. This location is going down hill. St. Louis ribs shouldn't be tough. Didn't used to be. Their website is broken. Try downloading the to-go menu. Link is broken. The email address on the website is a black hole. Went by Memphis and asked for a to-go menu. Was given a catering menu instead -- wasn't trying to feed fifty -- only four. Sadly I've given up on Memphis. I now go to Famous Dave's and it's far superior in all aspects."}
{"text":"Of course this place isn't going to be like real Memphis BBQ cause the real deal is in TN. But it's not too bad. I got the brisket sandwich and I liked it, just needed to add more sauce. My bf got the pulled pork sandwich and he like it well enough. The mac and cheese is a let down, so was the hush puppies. But the tea, potato salad and baked beans were all great sides. Service was pleasant and the prices were okay. I'd prefer the real deal any day of the week but going all the way to TN isn't always an option. In the meantime, this'll do!"}
{"text":"Highly over priced. Extremely poor food quality. This place has really bottomed out. I ordered brisket, guest ordered baby back ribs. Both were dried out and bad. Was there on Memorial Day Monday. Food tated like it had all been cooked on Friday in anticipation of big weekend and left to sit and dryout. Awful. The rolls were flavorless. The only thing good was the fried okra. That is because it is frozen in a bag, drop in fryer and serve. Hard to ruin. Been here many years and this used to be one of our favorites. Now it is horrible. $50 for two people for dinner. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I know that everyone has a different favorite barbecue style.  Typically I like most of them.  I read the reviews for this restaurant and was excited to see why it was a favorite.  Unfortunately it isn't one of mine. I selected the 2 item barbecue. Baby back ribs and burnt ends. The burnt ends were very good.  Very flavorful and not dried out.  The ribs however were not to my liking.  They were on the dry side.  Just didn't like the flavor at all. There are 2 sauces on the table.  I tried both of them.  Again just didn't enjoy the flavors.   I know the sauces are award winning, just not to my liking. Some people will read this and think I'm crazy.  Again we all have different favorite barbecue flavor profiles.   The French fries have a seasoning on them. I think it might be the magic dust.  They were ok. Not sure what all the fuss is about for the magic dust. I also had the Mac and cheese.  Not so great.  The service was good and attentive."}
{"text":"Did you know that when you order a loaded Beale  potato that says it comes with butter, sour cream, onion, and bacon that even though it says bacon you have to tell them you want bacon if you really want it. If not, it Don't come with it......... so moral of the story,  make sure you remind them that bacon is on it and you want it too!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The baby backs were pretty good. Sides weren't bad, creamed cord was more cream then corn. Beans were a nice blend of pinto kidney and Lima. I think the banana pudding was from a can"}
{"text":"Went in thinking \" hell yeah\" came out saying \"hell no\" . The ribs are not cooked for 7 hrs like they claim at all . They are par boiled then fast cooked. They were also from yesterday the mash and the mac is good.  The meatloaf is ugh more like meat mash! Sorry but its the truth the chef doesnt know wtf hes doing and the meat is clearly reheated but not to a good temp"}
{"text":"We had no idea what we wanted to eat for lunch...so we just drove...drove right past Memphis Barbecue and drove to another place about a mile down the road...except that place was closed. So we came back to Memphis BBQ go give it a try.  The place was pretty packed but we got a table quickly.   Sat down and ordered drinks quickly and dug into the menu. I decided on the lunch combo and ordered St. Louis ribs, BBQ chicken (breast and leg), and pork shoulder with a side of baked beans...it also came with a roll and butter.   I love BBQ, and while I'm no connoisseur, I do know what I like. So, the ribs tasted delicious, but they were slightly overcooked.  The chicken was also slightly overdone and I would put a touch of sauce on each bite as it needed a touch of flavor. The pork shoulder was delicious...and done to perfection. Topped off with the great baked beans and a great roll, this was a pretty good lunch.  Service was a bit slow amd we had to ask for extra napkins a couple times, but otherwise a good experience."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ joint in Las Vegas. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the products they serve. The plus side is that they support the local Air Force base and offer military discounts. But the BBQ itself is average. Nothing about the BBQ stood out, but if you're craving BBQ it will get the job done."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Not the best that I have had but not bad. You definitely get a lot of food for your money. I went with some coworkers and we all went away very full. I actually had to take a ton of mine with me because the mini sliders was just way too much food for one. The BBQ chicken was good, a little dry but good. The sausage had to be my favorite but it does have a bit of a kick to it so be aware. The BBQ sauce is \"okay\" but I think that is where I wish there was more flavor. The hush puppies I got as a side were a little on the burnt side, but the cream corn was good. The fried pickles I got as a happy hour appetizer were okay, but really salty/spicy and greasy. I would not order them again. But all in all it was a good meal. I wish the server was around a little more I had an issue with my order and had to wait about 15 minutes after she brought it out until she came back again. I would go back if my coworkers wanted too but it would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. From the moment you walk in you smell the delicious food. I've only had \"The King\" sandwich and it is so good. Portions are huge, service is great."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly.  I love that they recognize me any time I come in.  We are always greeted with a warm smile.  The service is always prompt.  I have been here many times and their has never been an issue with our orders.  On top of the great service, the food is delicious.  I recommend the wings as an appetizer with the sticky red sauce and the baby back ribs for the entree."}
{"text":"Was getting an oil change next door and decided to come stop in to see why they were champions apparently.  It was pretty slow so I was sat quickly. Server was nice, not too talkative. I ordered the 2 meat, 2 sides combo with dry baby back ribs and burnt ends, with Mac and cheese and red beans and rice on the side.  Food did come out pretty quick which I expected. The ribs were decent, meat came off the bone relatively easily. The burnt ends were great. Not overly sauced.  The red beans and rice, the rice was a little undercooked but wasn't terrible, and the Mac and cheese was a little runny but had good taste.  Overall, it was an average BBQ joint, wasn't bad food, but also wasn't anything overly exciting either. I would come back."}
{"text":"I went here because I'm a barbecue fanatic. I have gone to probably every other barbecue restaurant in Las Vegas and have them rated. According to my company I am the expert. So when I heard about Memphis championship barbecue I was a bit excited to come in.  I came in for lunch and although was in the afternoon there was no one at the door. I walked up to the bar sat down had some small talk with the bartender and place my order. She was not overly enthused about the menu items but I still ordered. First you never put something on the plate that you can eat so the kale has to go. Second you don't put ramekins with coleslaw etc. on the plate because they've been touched. Third The ribs that I ordered were supposed to be the St. Louis but were incredibly thin and reminiscent of baby back's. I asked him to take it off my bill because I was going to eat it. Lastly the beef brisket tasted like brisket. In other words it in fall apart there was no bark and it was a bit tough. All in all I'm not a fan. They should go over to rolling smoke or TC's rib crib or bells and move their operation to be more progressive have a tasting"}
{"text":"Meh, I came here with my family and I wasn't all too impressed. I feel like service was slightly slow and food was nothing spectacular. It took a while for drinks, appetizers, and food to come (possibly because of the hour we came).. but I will say that our time spent with the waitress, she was definitely on it; she ranks higher than the food and kept my Kerr's mug filled to the brim!   Food wise: We started with fried pickles... yes, I understand they were pickles.. and fried, but they were toooooo salty, and soggy/chewy. I have never had them before, nor have I ever fried pickles, but I now understand that frying pickles may be a hard feat. This marked my sodium overload for the day.  For dinner, I got the sandwich/salad combo and I stuck with a chicken sandwich. It was dry, and I ended up just eating the chicken without the bun because I wasn't a fan of the bun. Still, the chicken was dry, and I didn't finish it.  Will say that the croutons on the salad were pretty good! My dad got the pulled pork sandwich, and he said he liked it.... but dad's taste-buds aren't all up to par:]  So maybe barbecue isn't my thing... or maybe Memphis Barbecue isn't my thing.."}
{"text":"You know, there's nothing really bad about this place... but I didn't find it to be great either. Pretty decent sweet tea and lemonade. Ok corn bread muffins. Extra spicy hot links. Tasty smoked chicken. The burnt ends we got were mostly fat... Okra was not the best I've ever had, a bit salty for my liking.   This is not a place I'll be craving or longing to go back to. But if the mood struck me for some BBQ, I wouldn't not go here... it was just OK."}
{"text":"Went there last weekend after a race even at LVMS.   The food was pretty good.   The burnt ends were very tasty.   The pulled pork was ok, and the turkey was alright.   The folks there were pretty helpful and fun.   All in all, not a bad choice if you're in the area.    Also, maybe because is was Saturday after dark, two people hit me up for loose change on the 50 foot walk to my car."}
{"text":"I ate here a couple of weeks ago and used to get excited about eating BBQ in this joint but somehow, the quality has gone downhill. The food seemed better at their West Side location that closed last September. I tried the ribs, sausage, pork shoulder and they did not have burnt ends which is one reason why I like this restaurant. I even ordered a 2nd plate to see if the burnt ends were ready and they were not. I've eaten BBQ from coast to coast and might give this place one more shot. The staff is definitely friendly and accomodating but the BBQ is not the same!"}
{"text":"The Waitress was good. I have no complaints about her. However the food and soda are another story...they need to clean the soda machines because the soda tasted of old dirt and funk. The waitress knew about it but tried every machine in the restaurant and they were all the same nasty dirty taste. The food Babybacks, St Louis, Chicken and mac n cheese were dull as far as flavor goes. Food was cooked properly but the seasoning left a lot to be desired. Very dry."}
{"text":"Memphis BBQ -Yuuuuuuuuuuuuum!!!  cream corn, mac & cheese, BBQ Oooh MY!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally had the opportunity to taste some fixins from MCB and it was delicious and free as they catered my Company event today.  What we had to try out was pulled chicken and or pulled pork sandwiches, baked beans and coleslaw.  The baked beans were very very good and the coleslaw was sweet and moist. I liked it a lot and I am picky when it comes to coleslaw as I like mine on the sweeter side!  It was really good I have to say and their catering employees serving the food are very friendly and informative.  Their BBQ sauce is a bit less sweet and more watery than I am used to. I usually like a thicker and more sweeter BBQ sauce.  I will be back, I even brought a plate home for my boyfriend and he really enjoyed it as well :)  We will have to come in and check out the restaurant by dining in as well."}
{"text":"We first tried MCB almost a decade ago.  The food wouldn't win any competitions and the service was awful.  After food was delivered, the waitresses would disappear.  We looked around the restaurant and saw others just looking around and experiencing the same bad service.  Guests should not have to wave you over for refills.   We were in the area again recently and gave them another visit, hoping we would see improvements.  Unfortunately, we experienced the same poor service.  When food was delivered, the waitress asked us if we needed anything.  At the time, we didn't and we didn't see her again until she tried to sell us dessert. The restaurant only had three other tables filled.  There really is no good excuse for that level of inattentive service.  Again, the food was forgettable.  Good BBQ requires attention and patience.  Try to rush the process or cut corners and you get a dry, flavorless product.  Their chicken was rubbery and likely reheated leftovers.  The pork was more shredded than pulled and topped with a thin sauce that was mostly grease which is something you do to conceal poor, dry meat.  When the food and service is bad, it's always a sign of bad management who doesn't seem to be involved enough to know they're failing.  This restaurant is in serious need of retraining."}
{"text":"This place was simply not good. I'm disappoint I even stopped here. As a person from Memphis I should have known better. The bbq sauce was the worst thing i ever tasted in my life. The pull pork was dry and bland, the red beans and rice taste like it had vinager in it, the bake beans wasn't any thing special taste like it came straight out the can. That ribs were cold and tasted undone and covered in that nasty sauce. Overall I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst meal ever. Catfish was old fishy and the wait staff\" we've had a lot of complaints. It must really be bad\" wth . .burnt ends were crap too. Not fresh at all."}
{"text":"Below average Q that seems to be spotty in terms of service.  The beef links are tough and chewy with an off taste about them.  Ribs are hit and miss(sometimes dried out and tough).  Wings are lacking.  Sauces are forgettable.  Turkey is OK,one of the few positives."}
{"text":"Although it is a close race with Lucille's, this is the best BBQ in Las Vegas. The ambiance is fine, but Memphis Championship BBQ excels at one thing - the food. The pull pork and ribs are similar in quality and taste that you would find in Tennessee. Their sides especially the collard greens and beans are excellent. Everything about this place is simple and efficient making it a must go if you are looking for BBQ in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow! I honestly felt robbed after leaving this place! Food was disgusting, soggy and EXPENSIVE it didn't even taste good to the point where I was wow'ed! Normally wouldn't mind paying a bit for a new place that I've never tried before, but this place made me feel hopeless and confused! Never again!"}
{"text":"As Astro, the family dog on \"The Jetson's\" once said, \"Ruh roh, Rorge!\"... Sadly, things are not good at Memphis.  I've been a loyal MCB and Mike Mills fan for well over a decade, and I've been regularly eating at various locations of the popular BBQ restaurant in Vegas for at least that long. My recent trip back this week for what was once divine, heavenly BBQ shattered my perception of a longtime favorite.   The place was deserted on a Tuesday night, and unfortunately, now I know why...   God help us all, the BBQ at MCB was NOT good on this visit... And after reading recent Yelp reviews, it appears that management is allowing the once high \"Mills\" standards to fall. The pork was greasy, stringy, not very flavorful, and not very smoky. The ribs were better than the pork, but still not what they used to be. Stellar meat, no longer...  Service was slow and distracted, at best. Our server even felt so comfortable that he sat at another customer's table for 10 minutes or so, chatting.  My usual sides of turnip greens and red beans and rice have been reduced from a decent size bowl to a tiny cup, but at least they were still delicious, as were the rolls and cinnamon butter.  Mike, if you're listening, get your ass back to Vegas and crack the whip. The Rainbow location has already closed... It would TRULY be a shame to see MCB go down in flames"}
{"text":"Meh I've had better is my sentiments exactly.  I would expect with a name with \"championship\" in it would be an automatic winner (no pun). I know that this is a chain but my expectations for this place was high.   I ordered a \"king\" sandwich and some smoked buffalo wings.  None of these had any BBQ smokey goodness I've come to expect from a BBQ establishment. The meats were really bland and w/o any indication that it was cooked in an open pit or fire. Hell I would've been happy even with a splash of liquid smoke!  The sauces were both lacking in flavor. They were really runny and watered down.   For the same price you can go to Las Vegas Grille and get phenomenal BBQ!"}
{"text":"The king is really the only thing I get here on a regular basis. Most of the food is good. And they have a healthy selection of side dishes. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place out for a while. So much that this was our first stop on this Vegas vacation. Magic dust and sauce were both pretty good. Sampled the ribs, brisket and chopped pork. The sides we tried were fries, potato salad, cole slaw and baked beans. I guess my palate is more suited towards West Coast BBQ.  I did enjoy the chopped pork the most of the meats.  The one thing that could have been better was the staff, not really feeling their \" I guess I can help you out vibe.\" If one is looking for the itis this may be the spot for you."}
{"text":"My families new favorite BBQ place. Never had a bad meal here. The fried pickles are dead on southern correct. Fresh brewed iced tea in Mason jars. Sides are real southern cooking done right."}
{"text":"Ordered the burnt ends.  They weren't.  Meat more closely resembled chunks of meat that might have been smoked at one time but tasted like it had been recently nuked.  Had potato salad...nothing special.  Overall somewhere between bleh and meh."}
{"text":"The staff is nice, big portions and food is good, but not great."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a really long time, but my OG Ryan B came to meet me for lunch and we decided to try Memphis Championship. I have never been a big fan of this place or even BBQ in general. The service was really spotty today. It took quite some time for someone to come take our drink order and then another long wait to place our order. Our server was friendly but another server had to keep checking on us since she noticed that we were waiting long periods of time without being waited on.  I decided on The King lunch and my lunch date ordered the BBQ burger. She kept forgetting what he wanted and came back twice to check with him. At that point, just write it down if you can't remember.   Finally our food came out after nearly 30 minutes and by that time I was in a rush to get back to work. I asked for the check immediately when our food came out. We rushed through our food and I was happily back at work in time, but the slow service almost did me in, so I might have to steer clear from them when I'm in a rush. Otherwise, the food was good and I enjoyed the cream corn and their BBQ sauce quite a bit. The prices are really great for lunch too."}
{"text":"Myself and three co-workers went today, and the atmosphere was great, our waitress, was attentive, and everyone cleaned their plates except skinny Janie, who takes two days to eat one meal. I will get my fingers into bar-b-que here again."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Had their amazing pulled pork sandwich and finished it off with their delicious banana pudding!!! Great service and amazing food!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for meat and taters and that's what I got. The Burt ends were delicious and so was the the huge Idaho baked potato. The food came out quickly and the service was great.   Went on a Friday night around 6 and it wasn't busy but wasn't dead ether. Perfect amount of people if you ask me. It did pick up towards the end of our meal though.   Ended up asking for a new corn on the cob as it wasn't quite cooked though but the server was very polite and understanding. Ended up eating too much!"}
