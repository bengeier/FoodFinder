{"text":"Turns out, the other reviews that talk about a great new addition to the kitchen? They fired him. (I heard he was a really cool guy, too) I couldn't get food tonight, and I wouldn't based on stories I heard from my friends who practice at the rink. Bad vibes and bad history (read \"food poisoning\")."}
{"text":"Good local dive bar.  Good prices, nice bartender, nice memories of Tower Plaza, and the occasional puck hitting the glass behind the bar.  It is what it is, and that is exactly what I want.  I love places like this, it is an institution."}
{"text":"They recently got a new chef who revamped the menu. They still have bar favorites like wings, burgers, and fries but are also having weekly and daily specials. The Philly cheese steak is amazing. Friendly staff. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"The Ice House holds a special place in my heart and is a go to to escape the terrible AZ summer heat. Where else can you watch people ice skate when it's 120 degrees outside and also enjoy a good (cheap) beer. Staff are attentive and friendly. A fun, unique spot in Phx!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I only come here because my husband plays hockey here sometimes. The service I received the last time I had to be here was horrendous. I sat for over 30 minutes and the bartender asked me once if I needed anything (I said \"just water for now\"). While I was waiting for her to return, because I wanted a soda and food, she sat with her friend AT THE BAR and stopped working. Another 15 minutes passed and I still hadn't ordered. I had to leave my seat and hunt her down to request food. She is currently ignoring all patrons while chatting with her friend at the bar. Idk if this is such a laid back place that the owner/manager doesn't care, but if I didn't have to be here I would've left immediately. Unless you plan on serving yourself, don't come here. I may be a little too frustrated about being ignored in a bar of 12 people but come on. All thumbs down. Pretty cool decor and good music. Ok selection of booze. Not redeeming enough. Steer clear."}
{"text":"I come in here to hang while the fiance plays hockey and I must say, they're ALWAYS super friendly and welcoming! I love being able to have a beer or cocktail while watching the guys on the ice! It is also much warmer in the tavern than on the bleachers! ;) They recently hired a new addition to the team (I totally forget his name, darn!) and he is willing to whip up anything that your heart desires; homemade salad dressings, loaded fries--which are amazing might I add!, wings, etc. He even offered to muddle some cucumber into my gin and tonic for a light and refreshing twist! I will absolutely be back soon to hang! Thank you for always putting a smile on my face!"}
{"text":"Stopped over on a Saturday night early (8pm) to meet a friend. Yelp gave us a coupon for some tasty  fries. I'd go back to explore again."}
{"text":"I sat here for an hour and a half at the bar while my son was playing hockey.  Not ONCE did our lady bartender say, \"hello.  How is everything.  Thank you!  Have a nice day.\"  NOTHING. she was rude and absolutely not accommodating or friendly.  We are very disappointed.  Bad manners on Her part.    We didn't feel welcome nor taken care of."}
{"text":"Best Arcadia \"sports bar\" by far. Live sports right in front of the bar as you drink good, cheap drinks with ideal bar food and a great happy hour. I'm his place is a diamond in the rough and you're making a huge mistake every time you go to any other boring, run-of-the-mill, sports bar. Roberta is the Friday and Saturday bartender and she's bom and friendly and my friends and I love her."}
{"text":"What a delight and hidden gem this place is.  I highly recommend all lace up the skates and grab a brew.  Affordable merriment for all."}
{"text":"Super cool dive bar where you can watch some hockey and tip back a cold one. Usually pretty quiet but friendly atmosphere. I enjoy visiting this place."}
{"text":"Not open during operating hours, no one answered the phone and there's no sign explaining why.  Glad I came out of my way to bring my husband here for his birthday."}
{"text":"Great little spot to watch a hockey game! Super friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting at the bar watching game 1 round 1 of the playoffs and Morgan has been 100% on top of it. She's been both friendly and attentive even when I can see she's running through a bunch of orders in the back of her mind. Service has been awesome and the food has been solid. We got chips and salsa and beer cheese and pretzels and they have been way better than expected (I mean, what do you expect with barfood?). 10/10 would watch hockey and trash talk here again."}
{"text":"Charm+Dive feel. Good solid spot to watch a game. Kitchen opening soon. And fits perfectly in the peg of dive-bardom, providing you with that place that allows you to disappear from the responsibilities of everyday life."}
{"text":"Decent dive bar with a unique view of the ice rink. Seems like a place where the hockey moms go while the kid is at practice. Cheap and good bar food. It's a little hard to find, it's in the back of the shopping center."}
{"text":"Good view of the ice action.  Very friendly bartender and waitress staff.  Free popcorn too!"}
{"text":"Super divey bar with an amazing view of all the hilarious ice skaters. Highly recommend as a pit stop during a night of drinking!"}
