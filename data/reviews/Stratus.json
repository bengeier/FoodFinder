{"text":"3.5/5 
However, I cannot rate on the food. Went here for drinks on a friday night with a group of 3 after work. The cocktails were OK but not the best in Toronto. We were the only ones there for the majority of the evening. If you can sit by the window, the view is great. This place is good for the view and a place to stop by  for drinks before having dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful surprise - usually a great view does not come with such excellent food.  Stratus delivers on both - in addition to having extremely knowledgeable and helpful serving staff.  Prices were quite reasonable too.  Would highly recommend and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"3/5! Great option if you are looking for a beautiful view, good service and something in the financial district aside from Canoe; however, the food is not impressive. I went there for breakfast and ordered one of the healthier alternatives (so my review might be biased) but the omlette was rather bland and the options were overpriced. It is a good place to bring clients but I would not recommend this place to locals."}
{"text":"I've been to Stratus twice for business breakfast, and it is the perfect spot for just that. The view is absolutely stunning. To sit and watch the planes take off from Billy Bishop while you chat about work is a great way to start the day. 
Considering the location and the clientele, I was actually really surprised how cheap it was. Breakfast for three, with multiple rounds of coffee, came to C$70 including tax and tip. The food was lovely, and the espresso was quite decent. One of the better ones I've had in Toronto.
The service was a little slower the second time I went than the first, but we were also there a bit later (9:30 instead of 8:00), so it may just have been that.
Would recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"I started off my day with a business breakfast at Stratus. A really nice way to start off a Thursday!

Stratus is an intimate little restaurant with floor to ceiling windows overlooking Lake Ontario. For those who don't know, it's located on the 36th floor of 79 Wellington, just outside the Toronto Athletic Club.

Given its location, it's no surprise that it caters to business clientele. There is a good hum of converation, but it's certainly quiet enough to have a business meeting or catch up with a colleague over pancakes and coffee.

Speaking of pancakes, the banana pancakes are quite good, as is the yogurt and fresh fruit. Some items are a little overpriced (i.e. $8 for a bowl of regular cereal?) but it really is a hidden gem for breakfast meetings."}
{"text":"Charged me 100$ for valentine's cancellation. 
Despite cancelling well in advance. 
Never going to this place! 
That's just greed!"}
{"text":"Beautiful views on the lake. Fine dinning breakfast, comfortable and professional environment. I see this place becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with my work team. I made the reservation on Open Table and they kept it no problem. 

I think one of the servers was training because she was shadowing our actual server for the duration of the lunch. They got us drinks pretty quickly but were slow to catch our closed-menu cue that we were ready to order. Again, maybe they were preoccupied re: server in training. 

We had the bread basket to share for the table- it comes with a DELICIOUS spread. Everyone at the table got soups except for me and they said it was good. I got the albacore tuna nicoise. It was pretty mediocore for the price. The flavours were good and it was well-presented, but I don't think I'd be happy if I paid $27 for it. The tuna looked a bit too white (vs pink, which I think it should be), which led me to believe that it wasn't the BEST cut of the tuna. 

I guess it's an ambience-first restaurant, and the views ARE amazing. But I'm not really curious to come back."}
{"text":"Great place for a business breakfast meeting. Lot's of Bank execs have breakfast meetings here. Great view - top floor of the TD Waterhouse tower overlooking lake Ontario.  The food is good but a little over priced. Pancakes, yogurt  and omelette's are all good. Service is great. Never very noisy so ideal for a conversation or meeting.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We booked this place for a Christmas dinner with about 40 people.  I was surprised I had never eaten or been here before considering it's smack in the middle of the financial district.

Overall service was very good.  They did rush us in and out, so if you want to mingle etc. when booking in a party, it's maybe not the best choice.  Given the time of the year it was acceptable  Food was good for a mass order.  Dessert was excellent. Beer and cocktail selection was also above average as they carry a number of imports that they'll include in the private bar (delerium, leffe, etc).  I probably would not come here by choice for a regular lunch/dinner given the price as it is nothing spectacular, but caters do the higher end Toronto Athletic Club on the same floor.

Side note:  The washrooms are in the change rooms, so expect to see naked people when you have to pee."}
{"text":"Late start for breakfast on Wednesday 8/27, but the manager assured us we could still be served.  The view was magnificent and the service was the best.  Fresh coffee was prepared for us, and truthfully, it was the best coffee we had in Toronto.  Our server didn't steer us wrong with the choices she suggested.   Even as they were setting up for lunch she let us sit and enjoy the view and another cup of coffee.  We loved our server! Stratus is highly recommend."}
{"text":"What attracted me to Stratus was the 36th floor view. Came here for dinner with a few of my friends and was not disappointed at all. Loved the decor of the restaurant, the space was a lot larger than I had anticipated and everything shouted very sophisticated and upscale. 

Greeted upon arrival, we were given the option for coat check which I loved. Our table for six was waiting for us (with reservation) with a great view of the city as promised by one of the hostesses there. Service was spectacular, our server (whose name I do not recall), was very professional and everything I would expect from such a high-class restaurant. I did find however the one flaw which was our server who seemed to be pushing us to order drinks. 

I ordered the Grilled New York Striploin (medium-rare) and it had the perfect amount of juice and tenderness. Also the portions were enormous. I expected a tiny piece of steak (don't ask me why) but they gave me two fairly large pieces which was very satisfying. 

Had a lovely dining experience here and I would love to come back to try out their brunch menu and enjoy their gorgeous city view in the daytime."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, and really loved the ambience of this restaurant. By no means does it have the spectacular view Canoe holds, but with the high windows and open space, it definitely comes a close second.

I had the salmon, and loved how well it was cooked, and the lentils it was paired with. Would recommend the seafood here."}
{"text":"Along with the beautiful view, this is a hidden gem for brunch. I've ordered the SMOKED SALMON EGGS BENEDICT oak smoked salmon, potato latka, spinach, poached eggs, bernaise sauce... so goood especially on a bed of potato latka, instead of English muffins. Will definitely come back and very happy with the service!"}
{"text":"Really good food, great service, wonderful view and all at a reasonable price.  One of my favourite lunch spots."}
{"text":"Just a few bites from our full breakfast experience..

\"It is not a very large restaurant, and we felt a bit intimidated walking in. There was an upscale, business-like vibe in the air highlighted by glamorous interior with shiny reflective glass and polished surfaces all around.\"

\"The appeal was definitely there for the older folks with smooth jazz ambient pouring from the sound system, brown upholstery and a general feel of being in a high class place.\"

\"Their milk base oatmeal bowl was not too large but filled with goodies: walnuts, golden raisins, shredded coconut, dried cranberries and brown sugar. A very diverse mix of toppings, we thought.\""}
{"text":"I'm going to title this review \"So Far So Good\", because Stratus will be playing a huge role in my life over the coming year and there will definitely be follow-up reviews as 2015 progresses.

My fianc√© booked Stratus as our wedding venue in March 2014 for our October 2015 wedding.  We booked it based solely on the view, the fact it is in our price range, and overall atmosphere.  When we put down our deposit we hadn't even tried the food (I trusted the glowing Yelp reviews), so when I took my mother, sister, and future mother-in-law for lunch a couple weeks ago I was so nervous that the place wouldn't impress.  My fears were quickly dispelled.

I made a reservation and I am glad that I did.  It was a Friday lunch hour and the place got BUSY.  However, it never felt packed or crowded.  I counted about 80 people in the restaurant at one point, and we're only planning for about 60 at the wedding, so now I know that there will be more than enough room for my guests to stretch out and enjoy themselves.  We were seated promptly with a beautiful view of the lake and the island.

I ordered the butter chicken for lunch, and the food was served quickly.  The chicken had some really good heat to it, and the rice and naan were good compliments to the spicy dish.  I had expected the portions to be on the smaller side, but I ended up not being able to finish everything on my plate before feeling on the full side.

My only complaint from the whole day involved, believe it or not, the water.  We were asked if we wanted still or sparkling water.  Three of the four of us chose still and one chose sparkling.  Had we known that a large, $10.50 bottle would be opened for one person, I have no doubt that all of us would have chosen still.  I doubt that a whole bottle of water was consumed, and $10.50 is an incredible mark-up for carbonated water.  Where it's common place for sparkling water to be complimentary, this was a bit of a shock to see on the bill.

Initially we weren't going to have dessert, but after reading the menu we threw all caution to the wind and decided to try the creme br√ªl√©e and sticky toffee pudding.  The cream br√ªl√©e was appropriately creamy with a delicious sugar top, and the whisky infused caramel topping on the sticky toffee pudding easily stole the show.

After tip (and the overpriced water), lunch with dessert came to about $200 for all four of us, which is perfectly reasonable given the quality of the food and the stunning scenery.

The service was friendly and fast, though I do hope it will be slower paced on my big day (however, I chalk that up to the differences between catering to the 1-hour lunch crowd and catering to a relaxed wedding environment).  All in all, I have no doubts that Stratus will provide the perfect venue for my big day and I can't wait to experience everything they have to offer."}
{"text":"The night view was amazing. The servers are very kind and polite. My boyfriend and I had a romantic dinner on Valentine's Day. Overall the experience was good. 

There's just one thing. When we made a reservation, they didn't tell us it's gonna be a valentines special menu. We checked at the website, still the regular menu. When we walked in and sat down , we noticed that the menu was different from the website. It's a valentine special menu. It's fixed. No price on it. When we asked, the server told us it's 85 Cad per person, which is waaaaay more than the regular menu price. We didn't know that beforehand. My boyfriend received a call just a week ago before valentines from the restaurant. They told him they would charge him if he didn't show up, which totally makes sense, but they didn't tell us there's gonna be a special valentines menu with a special price. 

So I just think the restaurant should inform people of the special occasion price or menu when they confirm reservations. Also more information should be post on websites. I understand restaurants want to make more money on Valentine's Day, but customers also have the right to know more info beforehand. 

Later the manager came and offer us drinks and twenty five per cent off on everything, which was good. I think I will eat there again. The night view was spectacular. Very romantic."}
{"text":"the mens' bathroom at this place is inside the gym locker/shower room so you see a lot of naked dudes. just saying."}
{"text":"Work lunch, on the 31st floor at the TD South towers was a great experience.  Much like the panorama at Bay and Bloor, but with a better, unobstructed view of the city.  Definitely fancy.  
The service was phenominal, and catered to our attention, the food was quite an experience.  I ended up having the Brome duck lake ragout.  Pappardelle Pasta, Portobello Mushrooms, Spinach and shaved parmesan in almost a soupy type of pasta dish.  The flavors colaborated well with each other, and the portion was perfect for lunch! definitely a 4/5
There was still room for dessert, hence I ordered their Blood Orange Sorbet in a pastry dough bowl served with some fruits...great way to end off the lunch 4/5"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch meeting and was disappointed. 

I ordered the daily fish special which was bland and boney so I didn't finish it. 

They didn't bring bread to the table before our lunch and it took forever to get the bill when we were done with coffee.

Overall the ambiance was good but that couldn't  make up for the lack of service and not so great food. 2.5 stars experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is on the 36th floor and the view is magnificent. The place has executives (bankers, consultants) discussing work over breakfast or lunch. It has the Toronto Athletic Club on the same floor! The staff is courteous and efficient - they let you talk business. I loved the Butter Chicken and the Organic Salmon out there. It's a pricey place but folks prefect it as one gets to  talk business out there in a quiet environment. The location on the 'stratosphere' definitely makes the difference! Make sure you go there with a reservation and ask for a table with a view. Getting to the 36th floor could be a pain on a working day as the elevator stops at various floors. It would have been great if they had one directly to the restaurant.- comparable restaurant is the one at CN tower."}
{"text":"Great view and food is reasonably priced. I have also been there on multiple occasions for company functions. The staff  there are pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a group from work and it was great.  I had the burger which was perfect.  Others had the butter chicken, salad with steak on top, the daily fish special, the arctic char and the daily omelet - all looked amazing.  Deserts looked pretty good (I resisted) and so did cappuccinos.  Atmosphere was very pleasant with an amazing view.  Staff were very friendly and provided excellent service."}
{"text":"Firstly nothing really negative to say.  Food is good and quality has been consistently good. Decor and service is very good and friendly.  I have only come here for lunch four or five times.

Mostly it's the menu has never been all that appealing to me.  The mushroom soup is my default app and an omelette. 

Prices are fairly steep for an omelette and soup.  The prices and lack of appeal on the menu bring it down a star for me. Really want to like this place and will probably still go back for the occasional lunch for business but nothing special."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday after work and it was a really good time. A very nice spot for after work drinks with your coworkers.

The service was fantastic. The server we had, Christina, was very attentive and very pleasant - she had a perfect balance of letting us converse and do our thing and knowing when to come by and get us drinks.

The environment and ambiance were very nice. It is more on the classy side, so make sure you keep that in mind. I didn't feel like it was pretentious though. 

The food was absolutely phenomenal. It seems they have a happy hour between 4 and 8 where their starters are cheaper. You need to try the Wellington beef sliders. Absolutely delicious. Food came out pretty quickly too, all very tasty.

It's a bit pricey, but I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Great view from the 36th floor, definitely quite the spot for dinner.  I really enjoyed the music they played, a good kind of mellow and relaxing.

My main was the citrus & guava-glazed salmon.  Unfffff, SO GOOD.  The bits of papaya went perfectly with the salmon, and I could eat an entire bowl of the artichoke chips they sprinkled in the dish.  Such a great combination of flavours and I would definitely go again to try some other items on their menu on a free evening."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Stratus for lunch - located at Bay and Wellington, it is right in the downtown core, making it super convenient to dine out for lunch or dinner.

I ordered the blue crab cob salad, which is chopped romaine salad, smoked bacon, crumbled Stilton, cherry tomatoes, avocados, small poached eggs, all dressed in a red wine vinaigrette. The dressing had a really distinct taste when coupled with the blue crab. It was a very interesting salad; the avocado was also perfectly ripe. The Stilton is a bit strong, so if blue cheese is not to your fancy, you may not enjoy that aspect of it. The portion size I found to be good, but may be on the smaller size for a salad entree . The servings of crab was definitely sufficient.

I also ordered a green tea latte, thinking it would be matcha powder. It turns out it was made with green tea, however the latte was really well made and I thoroughly enjoy it.

The view of the restaurant is amazing; located on the 36th floor, you can see plenty of sunlight and parts of the lake."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. The food was the best we've had in Toronto and the wine was fantastic as well. Amanda was our server and she could not have been sweeter. She gave us more recommendations for the rest of our weekend in Toronto also, which was incredibly helpful. We had the tiger chicken and the salmon and both were fantastic. The view was also incredible. I could not write enough good things about this place. If you're in Toronto, you must go."}
{"text":"A hidden gem for sure! I'd never even heard of this place until recently, and it's in such a central location, close to Union Station as well as my office building. It's not a huge restaurant, but I like it that way, it seems cozier and more intimate, but it's still very classy and nice. They have large windows on the side so you can get a great view of the lake and some city lights in the evening.

There menu is a little bit on the smaller side, but the food is really, really good. I ordered the citrus and guava glazed atlantic salmon, which came with papaya salsa, field greens, and jerusalem artichoke chips. It was the perfect blend of sweet and savoury with the papaya, and a good mixture of different textures: the crunchiness of the chips and the soft flesh of the salmon, which was perfectly cooked and not dry at all. I loved it and would definitely recommend!

My friend got the blue crab cobb salad and it looked amazing. It came out on a really big dish and had tons of vegetables and avocado and a good amount of crab, and she said it was delicious!

I definitely would love to come back to this place! It's classy, but has such a cool, chill, environment - and they play great music, lots of Sam Smith and Ed Sheeran crooning in the background. And for a place as nice as this, located on the 36th floor of a building in the downtown core, the prices are super affordable and I would even consider to be cheap for downtown standards. My dish was only $25 before tax and tip. Loved everything about this place, and had a great time!"}
{"text":"Yes, great service!
Yes, chic place for breakfast meetings!!
Yes, amazing view of the Lake!!!


but the food was just a-ok! Had the Western omelette with a side of Canadian bacon (yes, bacon's the way to start the day!!) Was good, but not wow'ed!! Expected a little better!! Also had a latte that was... meh!!

So my recommendation: go for meetings, not on dates (if you still care to impress your guest!!)"}
