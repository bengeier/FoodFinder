{"text":"It's a little hole in the wall at the back of the Thai Express (wayy in the corner!) but the food is homemade, delicious, CHEAP and the banh mi is delicious (although the meats tend to be a bit too sweet for my liking). Their desserts are also reasonably priced at $1.50 and their banana tapioca bread is actually not that bad!!"}
{"text":"Pretty uncanny, someone else just wrote about this little find in the back of Thai Express. I'm pretty sure I found it first though lol, and have been meaning to write about it for a while now. 

Anyways, true enough - they have several (freshly, hand prepared banh mi sandwiches for $4). With mini baguettes that are ironically larger than the average banh mi bun, warmed all the same, and placed in a bag and twist \"tape\" tied. They have a few authentic flavours, that take a little more adventurous palate. I imagine they're good nonetheless, as made by a woman from the region.

Be aware that they only take cash or debit, and at that for a minimum of $5, so just grab a drink or a banana cake square for 1.50. You'll be good to use plastic and have dessert all at the same time."}
