{"text":"If you've ever had any experience with Mexican food, don't eat here, you won't like it. Also if you don't keep kosher you probably won't like it either.   For kosher Mexican it's probably good because there aren't a lot of options. If you can eat real Mexican, you should do that instead. On the kosher scale this is probably on the higher end b  Service was really good though. Clean, relatively quick. Unfortunately the food missed the mark."}
{"text":"I consider myself a 'regular' at Lime Taco.  I always enjoy the food and ever-changing menu. The Mexican kitchen staff know what they are doing. Authentic Mexican food, with a kosher twist.  I love the atmosphere here, too. It is tastefully decorated and is often playing salsa music.   A feature here is the bar counter. With  TV. And alcohol. Howbeit 5 or 6 stools, it is a great 'little' bar area to sit with a friend (or dine alone) and watch a game and enjoy some brews in a kosher environment.   I also can't complain about the basket of homemade taco chips and fresh salsa delivered to your table before you order :)"}
{"text":"Decided to go for dinner here with my wife.   First impression is that we like the looks and the atmosphere inside. Made us feel that we in Mexico.   The servant is very pleasant and knowledgeable.   The appetizers, soup and salad came up pretty fast. we ordered avocado salad, mini-chimi & chicken lemon soup.  We both enjoyed the first part of the meal very much.  The main food came right after we finished the first part.  I had steak fajita and my wife vegetarian burrito bowl.  The food was prepared very well.   Over all 5 stars experience and taste.  Much recommended"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but we found is a little light on the meat. We were there on a Wednesday night and service was a little slower than we would have liked. We really enjoyed the fish tacos - a first for us. Would definitely check out the place again in a few months since they just opened and re likely still experiencing some growing pains."}
{"text":"Recommend asking them to leave the canned corn out of your burrito. Note: think of them as Papas Fritas, and you can ignore the french fries with your tacos."}
{"text":"I am extremely disappointed with my dining experience tonight. This is my second time at Lime Taco. the first time, I had a superb experience. Tonight I am celebrating my 15th wedding anniversary, and I thought it would be an excellent repeat performance, and I was sadly, very disappointed.  We were there around 6pm.. the waitstaff was in the back, and we had to wait a long while to be seated, even though there were plenty of empty tables. when we were finally seated with a menu, we sat there for a long while. no water, no drinking glasses, no cutlery, and no chips/dip were given to us. We placed our order. mine was the drunken chicken with two sides, and my husband had the beef with jalapeno and two sides. I ordered rice and baked potato. the waitress neglected to ask my husband what sides he wanted, and he had to track her down (which was not easy bec she again had disappeared). he finally told her his two sides.  We also ordered soup.  the soup was ready for a long while and sat there waiting for the waitress to pick it up and deliver it to our table. the chef had to tap the bell 2x to get her attention. when she finally delivered the soup, it was cold. but at this point I was afraid to send it back bec who knows when I'd see the soup again.  halfway through us eating the soup, she delivers chips and dip to us. I had taken cutlery from another empty table since she never bothered to put any down.  she never did bring us a pitcher of water and drinking glasses to go with the water.   the family behind me told me she had to take her own menus bec. the waitress just sat them down with nothing.  then, again, before we finished the soup, our main course arrived. mine arrived with only one side and was delivered by a very nice waiter who was way more attentive then our waitress. he told me the baked potato was sold out. I declined another side as the portion was big.  then the waitress never bothered to give me the bill so I went up to the bar to get it. she seemed to have no idea that the baked potato was not there even though she was the waitress assigned to our table and I am sure the chef probably informed her of this.  Suffice it to say, I did not leave her a tip and sadly I will probably be not making a third visit to lime taco. the waitress is extremely disorganized and scattered.  I left the restaurant feeling somewhat upset on what should have been a happy night for me."}
{"text":"Parking: Easy to find spots  Seating: Plenty of space for big groups, has a back wall couch  Bathrooms: Generally well maintained.  Dining experience: Went in as a group of 5. My dish tasted a bit bland, I went for the vegetarian burrito which had beans. My friend sitting next to me got a steak burrito bowl, his smelled the best out of everyone my other friend tried a bit of his dish and said it probably tasted the best out of all of ours too. She had the chicken quesadilla and thought it didn't have much flavor. Another friend went with the fish, she said it was good. So you probably want to go with the ones that were mentioned to have tasted good.  As far as burritos go, I'll probably be stick with Chipotle, you can't go wrong with chipotle or that other place that serves the \"Big Ass Burritos\" (Quesada)."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Lime Taco on a Thursday night a few weeks ago for the first time and I would say that were both amazingly happy.  We had been talking about how the Toronto area needed a great Kosher Mexican restaurant and we were excited about checking out the new Lime Taco...so we trekked up north to check it out.  We arrived around 7:30 and the restaurant was about a third full, which our server said was unusual, in that we would generally need a reservation.  Our server was courteous, prompt and knowledgeable.  We started with the Chili as an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised with both the flavours, freshness and size of the dish.  In hindsight, the Chili could have easily been a meal, but we split it and thank goodness that we did because it was more than enough for both of us.  My wife had the baja fish tacos and I ordered the Steak Fajitas... the flavours in both were awesome and the portion size was much larger than we had expected given the modest prices. I've got pictures but for some reason I can't post them with this review.  Our total bill including tax and tip and a beer as around $55... something that we would have never expected.  This is my number one place to go to for a nice dinner in Thornhill.  Its a great combination of food, service and ambience."}
{"text":"I went back. The food is still the star, no doubt. Still some tweaks to the menu could be used, like removing the classic Mexican staple of fish and chips, and adding the menu to the website which appears to be updated about once every few years. A $9 appetizer of guacamole that comes with the same guacamole that you'll be getting for nothing extra with your main course and the same tortilla chips that you'd be getting gratis makes zero sense and the guacamole isn't the same as I remember it. On the plus side, it appears that the kitchen has figured out how to make more than one dish at once. I'm not sure if that's enough to say that the service has improved, but we can still see staff standing there doing whatever it is that isn't serving customers with the layout of the place. A mostly empty restaurant with two staff working the front shouldn't take as long to seat and provide menus to eager clientele. Decor would suggest a much warmer and friendlier place."}
{"text":"Its summer and I can't help but crave for Mexican food.  Lime Taco hits the spot!  True to its flavours and quite filling!  Fresh tomato siding with cilantros, smoked beans, meaty wraps, freshly made tacos, pitas, guacamole, and sauces.  It may have lacked the kick from chili or red pepper sauce that I'm hoping to get, but loved it anyway.    Its a small restaurant with cozy Mexican ambiance and its wonderful for family or group dining.  They have all the Mexican items you would typically look for and then some.    Price would be from about $10 per item.  And you'll enjoy the food here!"}
