{"text":"Once you have amazing sushi, it's near impossible to go back to the mediocre kind. A modest restaurant on the outside, it's a secret gem in the city for great sushi! The food is authentic, the service is great and the decor adds a nice touch to the ambience. I've tried almost everything on the menu. Some of the items are an acquired taste for sure... the owner even acknowledged that most people don't have the palate for certain Japanese items and gave me a sample of the shiso leaf, when I was curious about the ika-shiso sushi roll.

The first time I was here was within the first week of opening. I was disappointed that they could not complete our order because they were out of stock of certain seafood items. The owner suggeted alternatives and everything else that we substituted was amazing. Other times I visited, they would once in a while be out of certain items. I guess that's a sign that the food is always fresh. And that's the way it seems! YUM. I also appreciate that they post their 'daily fresh specials' on a board. 

It's a place that I will regularly visit."}
{"text":"One of the greatest Japanese restaurant in the city! We try lots of Japanese restaurant then always come back here. Amazing quality,but not costly!
Fish is fresh and lots of variety. Cooked dishes are tasty!
We love house roll! 3kinds of fish, avocado, egg, fake crab meat and more! 
Chirashi-sushi is a bit expensive ,but worth it. 
Services is good! Nice people and free tea! 
Hope they can increase portion of rice when we order a bowl of rice or lunch menu please."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here regularly for about two years now. We love Japanese food, and have been to Japanese restaurants everywhere, including in Japan. ND Sushi has become our casual Japanese resto of choice. Everything I've ever ordered has been good. Here are some of my favourites:
- edamame: delightfully cooked al dente and with just the right amount of salt
- gyoza: never over-cooked as in many other restos, very delicate flavour
- saba (mackerel) in any form (grilled, in miso sauce, or as sashimi): who knew a humble fish can be so full of flavour
- black cod: wonderful, melt-on-the-tongue fish filet; a treat as it's a bit pricy
- nabeyaki udon: I've had this classic dish in half a dozen cities, and this version measures up with the best of them
- unagi don: if one likes eel, one can't go wrong with this dish; just the right amount of sauce too
- tonkatsu: because I like my meat undercooked, I find this item slightly chewy, but it could well be the expected way
- sashimi: always fresh and delicious
- sushi rolls: \"blue ocean\" is the highlight, but all the others are terrific too
- house salad: love the dressing"}
{"text":"I decided to splurge on a nice high end resto for a special girl one night. Bring her to an authentic \"high end\" (notice the quotes) restaurant.

When I got there at dinner on a Friday night, I was shocked to see only one other table had been filled.

Opening the menu, I was shocked how expensive it was, but still enthusiastic about the amazing dinner experience we were about to embark on. Once the food started coming out, my mood changed. The salmon did not taste all that fresh or better than the AYCE buffets we normally go to (eg. Yangs). The price of one roll is almost the same as what an entire lunch AYCE meal would cost at most places. Definitely not worth the food for the price."}
{"text":"Amazing presentation and quality. One of my new favourites! I like to think you can judge a sushi bar by its chirashi and the chirashi here was definitely not a disappointment. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My first time at new location.
Food as usual is out of this world. 5+/5
Decor and atmospher is similar as before. 3.5/5
Service is similar as before. 4/5
Location even easier to get to now. 5/5
  - Lots of free parking on side streets.  
  - TTC pretty much right to the door.
Currently no alcohol but sign in front showed an application for it.
All in all, if their service was bad i would still come back just because their food is that good."}
{"text":"Went to get some sashimi take out last week, probably won't be going back.

Although it was only a take out oder but the server was absolutely friendly and attentive, so this part was ok.
However the selection was limited, we heard some really good thing about this place that they carry some special fish, but they only had the most ordinary ones.

The sashimi was fresh but can be only rated as OK among what we have had. We ordered the assorted sashimi A, $ 22 for 15 pcs. What we had in that dish were: 3 pcs of salmon, 2 pcs of white and red tuna, butter fish, hirame, hamachi, scallop. 

To be honest, I can get the same level of freshness (or even better) from Sushi Garden paying much less than this. With the price range here, if you are looking for some good, special fish, I'd truly recommend Jabistro.

In one word, not bad, but nothing special at all as well."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the best kept secrets in town.  I was there last night for dinner with 3 others and being a week night it was very quiet and we basically had personal service all night.  The other nice thing about ND Sushi is that on Monday and Tuesday nights, you can bring your own favourite wine or sake for a minimal $10 bottling fee.  We brought along our own sake for the night and the waitress was very nice to get us 4 sake cups.  

The nice thing about going to dinner with 3 others is that we are able to try a lot more food on the menu than otherwise.  So we started off with grilled squid with salad, gyoza, agedashi tofu, and sashimi.  The agedashi tofu was crispy on the outside but soft and silky in the middle, very nice.  I've always said it's hard for a restaurant to screw up gyoza as it's ubiquitous now but I was pleasantly surprised last night.  The skin was crispy but not over cooked and dry.  There were no burned sides, just lightly pan fried.  The sashimi looked as good as it tasted.  A feast for both the eyes and the stomach.  And the grilled squid with greens was grilled just right without being rubbery.  

That was just to start.  Next we tried the kaki fry, an assortment of sushi rolls, tempura (tiger prawn and vegetables), and spicy rainbow roll.  If you are a fan of oysters, you owe it to yourself to try the kaki fry.  I'm generally not a fan of tempura but the tempura shrimp and vegetables are very good here.  I like the tempura shrimp at Shinobu better but this is a close second.  The tempura shrimp is also in the spicy rainbow roll so bonus :)  The assortment of sushi rolls is really a preference thing as different people like different things so definitely experiment and see what you like.  

Service was very attentive but not overbearing.  The food came out together so we were not waiting one after another.  This was nice as we were able to sample different things at the same time.  I thought the price for 4 including tip and tax was very reasonable for the service, quality and amount of food we had.  Definitely in line with other Japanese restaurants of this caliber.  Bring your own wine or sake on a Monday or Tuesday night and enjoy the night with some good friends.  This won't be a best kept secret for too long."}
{"text":"5 out of 5! Definitely one of the best sushi places in Toronto! Fish is fresh and service is great! BYOD adds a unique touch! I recommend most of the rolls, including vegetarian options!! $$"}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally try ND sushi & grill since I heard so many good things about it, it's a MUST!! Every single bite lived up to my expectations.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, and the wait staff is incredible at being diligent and polite. 
We had the Omakase that was $50 per person. The waitress explained every ingredient and how to eat each course that came out. I have no words for how incredible the foods were. It was the most delicious, fresh and refined Japanese food I have ever had. 
The prices are a bit high and for sushi I'd probably stick with a cheaper place, but for a tasting menu experience I think ND was a great choice and definitely deserving of another visit.  Best omakase!"}
{"text":"visits 5+ (lunch visits)

I wouldn't consider this establishment to be highend. It's a small family owner resto providing fresh Japanese cuisine. The decor is trendy and warming to customers. 

I've been to numerious japanese restaurants in my time and by comparison, this is one of the freshiest. Not to take anything away from Guu, Yang's Teppanyaki, Ematei.

My quick lunch picks:
Spicy Tuna Maki
Spicy Salmon Maki
Spider Roll

I would love to try this place for dinner, so I can update this review.
Stay tuned."}
{"text":"Fresh, interesting nigiri and rolls. I traditionally go to Konnichiwa a few doors west, but the two times I've been here, I've realized I was missing out. This is lovely. Great service, nice room."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi - best I've had outside of Japan! Prices are good and great selection. Very authentic."}
{"text":"I love this place! My friend introduced it to me and now I'm a regular. Both the presentation and quality were very good. The servers were pleasant as well. I love the blue ocean roll and the rainbow roll. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Sashimi was very fresh and of melt in your mouth quality. Very happy with the care put into the food. Everything was very tasty and authentic."}
{"text":"I was once a superfan of this place; however,  the owner and her version of customer service is horrendous and rude. My husband and I went in and there was a table that just got their bill. Guy server said it will just be a few minutes which was great and the owner came to us and said it will be about 10 minutes.  I asked if it will be actually 10 since we did not have reservations and it was okay if it wasn't, we were going to grab a drink first and then come back. The same lady (owner) was so snarky and frankly, bitchy and said that they just gave the bill to the table but now, it will be at least 20 minutes. Okay... and then she proceeds to sit at the said table and started chatting with the people there (clearly was her friend). I don't care if she wanted to do so, but at least be honest and let us know. She gave us the staredown while she chats away and the poor guy server was just appalled by this whole situation. I loved this place but from now on, will go somewhere else. The service is terrible and we always tipped generously. Not worth it. Looking back now, sushi is mediocre."}
{"text":"I really love their rolls! It's full of flavour without overpowering the fish taste. Also had tempura, but their rolls are really amazing. 1 spicy salmon roll, 1 spicy rainbow roll, and one tempura apetizer was about $35 tax and tips included.

Edit:
Went back for a chirashi. Each fish had its distintive flavour. I liked it for the price as well."}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how much we LOVE japanese food. Our dream is to live in Japan and have Japanese food all day everyday one day. I know we will. But as for now, we are exploring different japanese restaurants all around the world. One of our favourite japanese restaurants in Toronto is ND sushi & grill. They do not offer crazy special sushi, but the fish is very fresh with a little bit of twist. This is how ND sushi & grill captures of hearts.

We first ordered agedashi tofu. It was very crispy and fresh when it came to our table. Although the sauce was not very salty and slightly tasteless, I was able to taste a very heavy taste of tofu. I liked it a lot.

We then ordered spicy sashimi bibim. It was very good and highly resembled Montreal Kazu's Salmon & Tuna Bowl which we loved so much. The spicy sashimi bibim came with a bowl greens with a generous portion of sashimi mixed in a sesame sauce, bowl of rice rice and a bowl of special sauce that tasted a bit like the bibimbap spicy sauce but more to the sour side. When mixed together, they tasted surprisingly good! The special sauce really complements the sashimi. The hotness and sourness increased our appetite which is what a appetizer is supposed to do and it was not too spicy to cover the fresh taste of the sashimi. The texture of green, sashimi and rice mixed together was very interesting. We really enjoyed this dish. One of the best from ND sushi & grill.

We also ordered two rolls - Blue Ocean & Spicy Rainbow Roll.

The blue ocean roll had hokkaido scallop, tobiko, avocado & cucumbers. This roll had a rather light taste and the main source of flavour was the freshness of the scallop. The tobiko gave a pop of flavour when you bit it. Overall, this roll highly contrasted with the spicy rainbow roll and I found myself eating them alternatively to balance the flavour in my mouth.

The spicy rainbow roll had seared tuna, salmon, butter fish layered on top,wrapped around prawn tempura, and most importantly, spicy oil drizzled on top that made this roll oh-so special. I have never had spicy sushi/roll/handroll like this kind. The spiciness did not hit me until I almost finished the piece of sushi in my mouth. Therefore, I was able to taste the actual flavour and freshness of the fish and the richness of the omega 3 oil after the sashimi was seared before savouring the spiciness of the oil. This was truly an amazing roll.

conclusion:

roasted!

if you want good, fresh sushi rolls, definitely try ND sushi & grill. You will not be disappointed!

visit http://theroastedacorn.com/2013/01/04/nd-sushi-grill/ for pictures of the food i mentioned :)"}
{"text":"Such good quality sushi, in such a nice intimate quiet setting! Also great service and food is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service along with a great meal has left me impressed and pleased with ND. 

I had the Sushimi Bento Box and the Salmon Skin Roll. Both were delicious!

I don't have a taste for tuna which was a piece of the box, but that's a personal dislike and wouldn't effect anyone who enjoys it.

The box came with tuna, salmon, fried fish, grilled chicken and of course miso soup, tea and a salad as the apps.

The miso was of note, it was full flavoured and not watered down.

Overall, I thought it was a great meal and I'll be back. 

Thanks ND."}
{"text":"Best Sashimi I tried, amazingly fresh. The teriyaki chicken is also very nice. The sauces are not like artificial ones in the market. They are really trying to make food an artwork.
There are not many seats in the restaurant and it's quiet. I think it's a good place to have a date or girls talk lol. 

The only one drawback is they don't accept credit card and the pos machine sucks."}
{"text":"Food:
Chirasu: the bowl looked pretty small but I was really full at the end. Fresh and nice variety.
Sushi Dinner: one of the best in town. Thick and fresh nigiri. Very satisfying.

Service:
Most of the servers were very friendly. Food also came pretty fast."}
{"text":"One of the best quality sushi meals I've ever had! The quality of the food is unlike anything I've had so far.

The decor is very cozy and intimate. It has such a nice atmosphere. If not for Groupon we might have never gotten to discover this jewel.

The miso soup was great. The texture and quality of the sashimi is on a different level than most other \"sushi\" restaurants. The Blue Ocean roll was incredible as was the Spicy Rainbow roll.

Park along the street just north of the restaurant."}
{"text":"There are lots of Japanese restaurants coming up these days but many fail to deliver a certain level of quality or uniqueness that justify even a trial run.

I can say quite honestly that I would have never considered this place if my friend had not had a coupon for pretty much 50%. (Thanks Groupon!)

Anyhow, if you haven't taken the hint yet, I didn't think this place was off the chain. See below for the deets:

Decor:
The signage was a bit weak as the main text is not lit up and only a small sign by the door says Sushi Bar and Grill.  We actually missed it as we were looking for it.  During the day, finding it should be ok, but c'mon, only bigtime restos like Suser are allowed to have super minimalist signs that say \"Restaurant\". =P

Modern decor, dim lights, candles...hmm date worthy? Sure. But since I went with my guy friend, awkwardness.  We essentially shared a candle-lit dinner together...bro-style.


Food:
The rolls were the best part of the menu (Spider Roll and Kamikaze) as they were a solid 2-3\" in diameter!  Both flavorful and the perfect blend of spice and crunch.  My friend actually prefers to eat all sushi and sashimi without sauce to really experience the flavor of the food and he agrees that the rolls were pretty solid.
After that, it's a bit of a free-fall. The salman sashimi was adequate I guess but could be better if I didn't taste a bit of ice.
The Tempura wasn't as grand as we had hoped.  The batter was ok but for 9$ (no soup, salad or rice), we had hoped we would get more than 2 pieces of shrimp and vegetables.  The Ika Karage was pretty much tempura battered squid and calamari but it wasn't battered well (soft and flavorless) accompanied with some house salad with a dressing I could not pinpoint.

Service:
The rating does not really speak on the service as our waitress was kind and super polite to us.  I have no qualms with that 

Overall:
The issue I have is pretty much food-oriented and maybe choice of location.  It's sub-par food if anything for an A La carte Japanese restaurant.  I  mean, I've had better tempura and sashimi at all you can eat restos which is kind of sad.

Location-wise, I acknowledge that it is located near a neighborhood but it still needs to bring a stronger presence to make a name for itsel and attract ppl as one of only Japanese restaurants in the vicinity (I assume)."}
{"text":"Me: When do you want to come back?
Wife: Tomorrow.

On some visits to ND, this conversation goes down before we finish. Sometimes before the food comes out. We would go almost every day if it weren't for the guilt and embarrassment.

Food: ND is my favorite sushi and Japanese restaurant in Toronto. The quality of the food is excellent. They regularly have big eye tuna and sockeye salmon - a very good sign for a sushi place. Some of my favorites are big eye tuna nigiri and the spicy salmon roll (although I'm not sure if they use sockeye in it). The big eye is beautiful - slightly translucent, great color, generous cut. Their spicy salmon roll doesn't use a mayo base, which I really like. Some other favorites: The sushi lunch special, which might be the best deal in town, and the nabeyaki udon, which will warm your belly with its delicious broth, udon, chicken/egg, and vegetables.

Service: They run a tight ship. When it's busy, the waiters/waitresses are spread thin. But they are attentive and very nice, even when busy.

By comparison: I've been to Yutaka, Yuzu no Hana, Japango, Saku, Akai, Konnichiwa, New Gen, Sushi on Bloor, and Big Sushi. No disrespect to places like Yutaka and Yuzu no Hana, which are solid, but ND is better and also better value (where value = quality/$) than all of these places. The quality of sushi (and non-sushi food) is at least as good if not better than the others, and it's slightly less expensive.

Other: The recent reopening on College was the best food news I received all year."}
{"text":"Guard your credit cards!!!

They played 3 card monty with my credit card and double-charged me. They claimed to have over-charged me on my meal, then asked me to insert my card to refund me the amount. Problem was - they never over-charged me - that was someone else's receipt (different credit card number) which I didn't notice, I just thought they were being nice/honest. When I received my cc statement and saw that I was double charged, I discovered the error on the receipts and attempted to resolve the matter civilly with the manager (the non-Japanese lady) who was very rude to me, told me that I was wasting her time, and that my business (including the 5 other people I brought with me the night we ate there) was not worth the refund - which was $25. 

Naturally, as they have two receipts with my credit card - I can't prove to the CC company what happened, so I lose. 

Not only is she rude to me, she is very rude and demeaning to the Japanese staff she's hired, so much so on a previous visit I actually had to console our server from how she was treated.

Based strictly on how this manager treats people, I would not eat at this restaurant again. I gave her the opportunity to provide great customer service, and I would've returned and spent a lot of money there over time, instead - she thought it was better to make $25 and run."}
{"text":"Boutique Japanese restaurant that is authentic. The sashimi was fresh. Small restaurant very relaxing and cozy environment."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi restaurant in Toronto. Everyone I bring here enjoys it.

The food is fresh. You can always get a table (I honestly don't understand why there isn't a line-up).

My favourite roll is the spicy rainbow roll. I get it every time. Other rolls that are good: spicy salmon, house roll, blue ocean.

It's actually hard for me to try other dishes on their menu because I always have to get a spicy rainbow roll, which pretty much fills me up. 

It sometimes takes long for the food to come out, but I don't care. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best places downtown to get rolls and sashimi. Pretty cute little spot on baldwin with surprisingly decent prices and great food quality. Its always a place a recommend and come back to."}
{"text":"This probably should have been a four star experience, so I'm pretty upset to have to give it a worse review, but the service was bad enough to warrant a full star removal.

Waitstaff were very sweet, but clearly inexperienced, and seemed completely overwhelmed by a relatively small crowd.  Normally I would overlook minor errors or forgetfulness from waiters - we asked for tea three times before getting a refill - but the problem was compounded by an excruciatingly slow and poorly managed kitchen.  When the third of six small dishes came out at the 1h15 mark, it became pretty clear we weren't getting out of there any time soon.  We were obviously not the only ones being neglected either, given that another customer barely kept from making a scene asking for his bill early because he'd been there for over an hour and still only received one dish.  2+ hours later, my bf - who I've never known to pass on dessert - decided against it because he \"didn't feel like being there for another half hour\".

Worse - they were out of both mackerel and soft shell crab!  Only two ingredients, but it meant that five dishes we at various points wanted to order weren't available.  And because the waitstaff was inexperienced, they didn't handle the situation very well - didn't tell us when we first ordered, not sure what ingredients were in things, not clear what the kitchen was out of.  In the end, we had to deduce for ourselves that the fact that they were out of grilled mackerel meant we probably weren't getting our mackerel sashimi, either, and had to remind our waitress.

Food - decent, but everything was so slow and disorganized, it got forgotten in the melee."}
{"text":"By far the best omakase I've had in Toronto so far, although I've not had too many. The dishes are creative in both their presentation and flavour pairings. The ingredients are all especially fresh. Uni didn't taste smelly, fish was top notch. 
Service was a little slow but nothing unacceptable. Portions are a slightly on the small side, so you maybe hungry after if you tend to eat a lot. 
But each dish raised the bar and kept you in anticipation for the next one."}
{"text":"There are tons of sushi restaurants in Toronto. But not too many have uni, and this place has it. It was a long last journey to get my Toronto native cousins to try uni.  But it was not California uni. Nonetheless, the place is nice and the staff were great. The sushi were better quality than other places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi place in Toronto. Have been going to the old location at Baldwin for years. The new location is great too. Same menu&taste."}
{"text":"They are the most unique sushi place when it comes to vegetarian sushi.  Their roles and appetizers were so playful, interesting and delicious using only veggies.  The agedashi tofu was light yet crispy and perfectly served.  All the ingredients were very fresh.  The outdoor seating was cozy, quiet and intimate.  The staff was attentive and kind.  I really enjoyed my visit here!

Only problem was they were cash only which forced us to hit an ATM.  Not the worst problem though."}
{"text":"I haven't tried food from their menu, but I ordered \"omakase\" which means \"chef's choice\" for $80.

They can serve you WHATEVER the chef decides to give you for that day, and I was NOT disappointed.

It was 11 courses of beautifully presented, delicious meals ending in one of the most amazing creme brulees I've ever had. I also had the panna cotta just because I couldn't get enough.

I loved the atmosphere (not too loud, noisy or packed), and the food was really amazing. I think it's by far, one of the best sushi restaurants in Toronto.

I cannot recommend this place enough. Run by true Japanese, served Japanese-style with such politeness.

By TTC, you go up to Yonge and Eglinton at Eglinton TTC, and take the Eglinton bus East to Laird (just before the Canadian Tire, Best Buy and all the other stores).

Then walk south.

It's tucked away in a corner and parking can be a bit tricky but in front of the restaurant is fine.

I am coming back and taking my mom for one of the best dining experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"AMAZING OMAKASE!

I have not tried the a la carte here, but the Omakase is really good. It's $50 and that is hands down the best bang for your buck for any Omakase in Toronto. I've had more expensive ones that don't compare. Their dishes are very simple letting the flavours of the fresh fish and subtle sauces speak for themselves. Amazingly fresh sushi and sashimi here. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Had a sashimi craving so called and walked over for some takeout late night on a whim.

1) They don't take credit card even though the yelp page says that they do & I had to go back to grab cash. Would have been nice if they gave me a heads up over the phone when I ordered. 

2) My sashimi platter was actually quite disgusting. It wasn't fresh at all and even tons of wasabi and soy sauce couldn't save my meal - I ended up throwing half of it away because it was making me gag. I love a good piece of fish, but these pieces were so thick it was practically a cube! It wasn't cheap either (~$30 after tax), so that was extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for the reopening of ND sushi for a long time. The food is fantastic as always. The sushi lunch is great value."}
{"text":"It's our go-to sushi place, and it never failed to deliver. Great value for price! Highly recommend their Unagi don. If you want to try something different, then order ageyashi tofu."}
{"text":"Unagi don was on point.  Grilled sauce lightly drizzled with unagi sauce on a bed of rice.  Good portion size and eel melts in your mouth.  Plenty of seating.  Will come back to try other sushi items."}
{"text":"Great little place downtown Toronto down the street from University of Toronto. 

Came here for lunch with my colleague as she recommended this place. Read many reviews that recommended the chirashi so definitely ordered that. The fish was definitely fresh huge pieces but the salmon roe was probably from a bottle because it was wrinkly and super fishy. The rice was good but it was cold. The portion looked small when it first came out but it was super filling and they don't use the tube wasabi. The salmon teriyaki was huge and very well cooked. I didn't really enjoy their salad or miso soup - it was meh.

staff there is friendly and nice environment. Would return and try out their other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Couldn't miss out ND Sushi's soft opening! New to the location, it is open kitchen and there's also long table for solo sitting. Some new menu option like Maki Set and House Rolls are great. Price point is about the same as before and the quality of food stays fresh and consistent."}
{"text":"If it was based off of the food alone, this place would easily receive 4-5 stars. The problem with this restaurant lies in the management and services. We had to wait around 35 minutes after we ordered to find out that what we ordered was not available. Of course we were not impressed and talked to the owner, who was extremely rude and full of attitude. By the time we were done with her, she had ruined everyone's mood. The waitresses were very nice but we could not stand the owner. We will probably never come back to this restaurant. 

Another thing is that they DO NOT accept credit cards, which is a huge inconvinience. They need to update their profile here as to not confuse the customers."}
{"text":"Solo dinner, lateish after a conference reception. ND Sushi was very close to where I was staying, so I went in--and I'm so glad I did! Lovely service, simple decor, beautifully presented, super fresh sushi. I can't ask for more from a small sushi place! The miso soup is a little smokier than usual, and I mean that in a good way. The chips of bonito floating in the broth were likely responsible and I may just do that next time I make my own miso soup. The salad was bright and refreshing (and an easy way to get some veggies) without gobs of sticky sesame-ginger dressing. I had sashimi, sushi and maki, all of which tasted ocean fresh. I'll make an effort to come back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Super small, cozy and nice place! We almost missed it because the sign is super super super small. We had lunch at ND which was fantastic value! The sushi was fantastic, we also had soup and salad as part of the lunch offer which both were very delicious, too. The service was outstanding, so I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing. My mouth still waters just thinking of my meal here.

I think thanks are in order: to Groupon - for incentive to try this lovely, chicly minimalist resto; to Yelp - for calling the spicy rainbow and spider rolls to my attention; and to ND Sushi&Grill, for lovely service and for creating the honest-to-goodness best rolls I've had in this lifetime.

My friend and I also shared the quail salad, which was quite nice (with fresh greens and dressing that was flavourful but not overdone) but rather eclipsed by the rolls: fresh, buttery, melt-in-your-mouth-delicious fish laid lovingly over tempura and avocado (spicy rainbow) rolls; and crispy soft-shell crab balanced with cucumber, tobiko, and avocado in spider roll form. 

Honestly, I'm not sure how the other food is here, but if all they served were these two rolls I would still come back again and again - even at full price, it'd still be a bargain."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Japanese restaurants. The chirashi is my go to. Glad to see that the portion sizes haven't changed since the reopening."}
{"text":"One of my favourite sushi joints in Toronto!
What I like about ND Sushi:
- High quality sushi (warm rice, fresh fish, need I say more?)
- Rolls are not too expensive (other items on their menu are somewhat pricey...though probably standard)
- Great location

What I don't like:
- They don't always have the spider roll, which is a shame because it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place and quite hidden along Baldwin street. Perhaps its the first few restaurants on that street, people can easily walk past it.

ND Sushi is a small Japanese restaurant that's pretty dim yet cosy. They have limited seating so reserve if you can. The service was quite good, waitress came by few times for water refill. The food came out very quick too, possibly because it was sashimi and raw dishes.

I ordered chirashi sushi meal set that includes salad and miso soup. The salad sauce was nice, brought more appetite on me. As for the chirashi, I can't name you the specific fish types but it was really delicious and fresh. There was salmon, tamago, salmon roe, eel, salmon belly, and others (sorry that's all I know!). My bill came up to around $30.

Overall this place surprised me in its quality. It was quiet pleasant restaurant in a quiet neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here on a rainy day, and was the only table for a long time. Ordered a few nigiri pieces and a dynamite and spicy salmon roll. Overall, a pretty mediocre sushi place. Again, the price of the sushi didn't quite match the quality of it. Though the fish quality was really good, the sushi pieces as a whole were only ok. Considering that I was wowed by the sushi at Wow (no pun intended), and at a slightly lower price no less, I find it unlikely that I will return here especially since it's not too far from Wow anyways. In addition, my bf ate the spicy salmon roll on his own, and he found that the spicy sauce wasn't very good in his opinion. Something to keep in mind for the spicy salmon fans out there!

However I will point out that service is very good; very attentive waitress. And one of my favourite aspects was the frosty cold water bottles that we poured our water from. I love drinking really cold water, and I can only imagine how refreshingly awesome that would be on a hot summer day. Also their dessert menu does sound interesting though I haven't had any. Had items like green tea creme brulee and a panna cotta with a japanese twist. Maybe I'll return just to try the desserts?"}
{"text":"Presentation, and surprising food morsels are their real assets here.  I had some sort of set lunch menu, which came with a lump of unidentifiable fried piece of food.  
It turned out to be succulent, flakey piece of fish. So good.  I don't remember what the main lunch was, but the little appetizers really sealed the deal! Lunch is reasonable here at between $9-12. Service was prompt at this small-ish restaurant."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian sushi - cucumber and avocado and just plain avocado I have ever had in this city.

I can't rave about the other veggie options, sadly but those two are just made to perfection, fresh and just melt in your mouth. Yum!"}
{"text":"I stand corrected. Having been here two more times, I think I've found my favorite sashimi spot.  Always fresh and generous portions along with great service and value."}
{"text":"Seriously what happened to ND sushi? They used to great on Baldwin st.  We went there today Dec 2nd 2017 on college st and it was a disappointment. 

Service was slow, food took forever to come out, they didn't give us wasabi with our sushi, we asked waitress for some and she also totally forgets the wasabi.

Their portions used to be generous but not even close now. I left hungry ordering sushi A and grilled eggplant side dish.

Thier grilled eggplant used to come with a large eggplant and now its around half the size.

We also ordered nebayaki udon, it should be called empty shells noodle soup.

I pointed out to the waitress that none of the mussels  (4 of them) actually had any meat in them. It's like they just reuse empty shells. The waitress went back to the chef and later came back to us and said that that's just how they are. At $12.50 for a small bowl of udon I advise everyone to stay away from this one.

I noticed everyone around us were complaining how long  the food took to come out. Even though it was about 60% full.

ND sushi used to be our favorite sushi in Toronto.    Now we are afraid to go back."}
{"text":"I came here after buying 2 groupons.  it's a small restaurant in baldwin village, among many other japanese restaurants.
i ordered a miso soup, spicy rainbow roll, spicy tuna, cucumber roll, and a house roll.
the spicy rainbow has butterfish on top, and is by far the best roll i have ever had, with a nice tanginess and some shrimp tempura on the inside.

the presentation for all rolls is stunning..  however, i wasn't a fan of the house roll, a bit odd, and almost tasted like ham

both times i've been here it was just me and one other table, so it's a bit concerning, and hope business will pick up.  service is just right - well-paced, giving enough time for each roll.

i'd love to come back here soon and would recommend this restaurant, especially the spicy rainbow roll."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi place that not a lot of people know about (at least now people I know)! I've only been here for lunch, but their prices are very reasonable for the high quality of sushi you get. Their lunch combos come with the same good old miso soup and salad, like other places. However, it's served in fancier dishes and I love them! It's a small place with not a lot of seating, but it's pretty spaced out and quiet. They also have a small patio that's probably open in the summer, but I've never been."}
{"text":"Fresh food and fresher sushi!  The name is \"Non De script\", but don't let that discourage you from trying this place.  

My mom and I were looking for a Japanese food place along Baldwin and we happened to try this place according to Yelp reviews.  I am so glad that we did.  They have a chalkboard with fresh sushi offering and we had the Big Eye Tuna sushi from Boston.  Oh boy!  Melt in your mouth goodness.  Is this what I have been missing my whole life????  We also had the grilled eggplant, spider roll and tempura; all of which were textbook perfect.  The spider roll was humongous and I am sad to say that we had to use a fork and knife to eat it.

The service was continuous and unobtrusive.  Our teacups were always filled and we were asked after often enough but not annoyingly so.  Next time I have a hankering for good sushi I will take a beeline to this establishment and park myself to eat only sushi.  Yum!"}
{"text":"New location, new look, same great quality of the food! I've been a customer of ND sushi for years and they finally reopened at the new location. Not sure about the quality of their service but the food has definitely remained fresh and delicious as always."}
{"text":"Roll with daily picked Vegetables was delicious, mackerel w/ miso could have been a bit warmer when served. Sashimi was one of the best I've tried in To.Their sashimi lunch bento is very filling and tasty as well. Service was great."}
{"text":"Simple, tasty, inexpensive Japanese hidden gem in the Baldwin Village.The fish is fresh, and they get inventive within the bound of tradition. The atmosphere is calm, mostly locals and families, and the food is dope.

The Omasake is excellent. My personal is the Chirashi-zushi, the sushi bowl. It is fully packed with fresh seafood and relatively inexpensive. Great value and great flavours. Whats not to like?"}
{"text":"Since I had the Chirashi, I was able to taste each of the fish slices individually. Fish quality was 5 stars - added bonus was the unexpected scallop and Toro tuna pieces that came with at that price range. All the pieces were mouth watering! Rice was excellent. I ordered Uni a la carte, and after asking, was told the Uni was 1-day old - right within the window of freshness for uni. Uni was excellent.

Overall I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of fish and value. I'd recommend ND to anyone looking for a good Chirashi bowl or Sashimi dinner. ND would be one of my top picks for a non-omakase sashimi restaurant. 

Good job ND staff! Will visit again."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite sushi place downtown. Everything was so fresh! Loved the scallop maki rolls. !!"}
{"text":"Excellent japanese restaurant! Good welcome and fish really fresh! 
Nothing to add! I recommend this place"}
{"text":"They DO NOT take credit cards. They only accept cash and debit. 

Food is EXCELLENT! Prices are cheap to reasonable. Service is impeccable! 

Very small place. Reservations is a must for dinner. I saw many people sadly turned away because they were fully booked."}
{"text":"The quality and quantity went WAY down.
I used to go religiously to ND Sushi when they had their location at Baldwin.

I would go a lot with my mom and boyfriend.

Today I went with my boyfriend for the first time to their new location on college st, and we both were quite upset with the presentation of the food :(

We walked in at 2:30pm and we were the only customers.

Ordered 2 California rolls, 1 salmon avocado, 1 Dynamite and 1 Tempura(5pieces).

The California and salmon avocado was the first to come, real quick. We were surprised it was ready so soon... I realized now there was a young man who made this one for us and the Dynamite was made by the owner.

The one made by the young guy was so badly put together the rice was already fallen apart when we were given the order, he clearly lacked the water vinegar your supposed to use to help stick the rice together.. I've seen all you-can-eat restaurants that have 5 times better presentation then what we got.. that might sound harsh but I'm really surprised he gave it to us like that... I can't believe the owner didn't look over it beforehand.

And the kid had zero excuse to rush it when we were the Only customers there. So regardless it should of been made with care. It looked gross... half the point for restaurant service is the presentation of the food.

The size in shrimp for the tempura is now half the size, as well as the some of the veggies now... what happened???!!!

I walked out and told myself I wouldn't want to go back if there someone who works there that makes the food half-ass.. it brings down the value of the place that I once new.. 

I expected better for a restaurant I used to love."}
{"text":"Decor is intimidate and romantic, great place to take a date (not like the usual Japanese places)

A lot of interesting and innovative dishes. the highlight was the fantastic fresh spider roll. We also enjoyed the dungenous crab salad (shaved celery, fennel, and taro chips). A lot of interesting desserts as well, yuzu cream brulee (very delicate crunchy layer), black sesame panna cotta, red bean banana spring roll. 

Overall a great experience. We hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place! This little restaurant on Baldwin street is, in my opinion, right on par with Wow Sushi and Japango. Their sashimi is generously sliced (but still thin) and so fresh. The Ocean Roll is AMAZING. The house roll is absurdly large (more like a futomaki with a diameter of 2.5 inches) but surprisingly delicious. Lastly, the spicy tuna roll was also great. I would definitely recommend this place and come here again."}
{"text":"I have never written a review on Yelp but this time, I feel a great urge to warn others out there who are interested in trying this place solely due to reviews.  The restaurant is very small and it gets extremely loud.  I am currently in the restaurant right now waiting for my food.  So far, I only received my sea urchin sashimi since I placed my order 20+ minutes ago.  Long wait for something that does not need preparation and the dish was not even nicely plated.  The sashimi looked like a pile of mess and the wasabi has no flavor.  Although the sashimi is fresh, it is not worth 20 minute wait.  I am STILL waiting for my mains 30 minutes later!  There is only one chef actually making sushi and they serve one table at a time.  I WILL NOT BE COMING BACK unless I have 3 hours for a causal sushi dinner.  *update: the fish is fresh so I am giving it 2 instead of 1 star.  Also, anther customer sitting in front of us is also getting frustrated with the wait.  At least I am not the only one.  By the way, my sushi rolls fell apart when I picked it up, something that another reviewer here also experienced.  No, I am not coming back even if I have 3 hours for dinner.*"}
{"text":"Although ND is closing, I've decided to write them one last review.

I love love love their rolls. My favourite is the blue ocean roll, which is a scallop roll with tobiko. My second favourite is the chirashi. It is potentially the freshest chirashi I've had in the city of toronto. There is a piece of unagi included as well as caviar. The chirashi is on top a bed of japanese sushi rice within a bowl with all the deliciousness arranged on top.

You can also add $6 to make your rolls a meal. The $6 will consist of a miso soup and a full salad side. The salad is bigger than what you would get at all you can eat places.

This place does not take credit card, so ensure that you have enough cash with you or bring your debit card."}
{"text":"I've been here about 8 or 9 times in the last two years. Sometimes I come with my partner only and sometimes with our young children. The food has been consistently of high quality and well prepared. The sushi and sashimi is undoubtedly the best on Baldwin, if a bit pricier than the other offerings. Service has always been excellent though on one occasion we were served much more slowly than expected, perhaps because of the multiple large groups. 

We thoroughly enjoy dining here and will continue to be regulars."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sushi places in the city.

Their fish is always super fresh and delicious. You really can't go wrong with the sashimi or the sushi plates. I'm usually not the biggest fan of rolls, but the house roll was on point and really filling.

The service was also great. The waitresses are all very attentive, and the manager was very accommodating to requests. Overall, a great experience.

The prices are a touch higher than other sushi places, especially if you're going on all out on the sashimi.

Make sure the to reserve a table for Friday or Saturday night. The restaurant is tiny, so they're generally full for dinner."}
{"text":"Tried ND Sushi with a couple of colleagues the other day. The sushi was wonderful but I was a tad disappointed with the sashimi (it supposedly changes regularly). That said, the food was really fresh and the California rolls were excellent! The service was good but I think I will stick to the sushi next time."}
{"text":"I love ND sushi but I gotta dock some stars off for service.  We were lucky that we were able to walk in on a Saturday night with no reservations (arrived at 6:30pm).  We didn't get our food till 7:40pm.  Took us five mins to eat two rolls because we were super hungry.  Our next roll can in 20 mins and we finished that roll in under 5 mins.  Yummy sushi but I think only one chef works here.  In the past, I used to come to the Baldwin location at 5:30 and have three rolls within the hour (service was great).  I'd still come to ND sushi but probably not during the dinner rush hour."}
{"text":"If I vote for this place, that is only because I love the fish species themselves. The ingredients are prepared dry, so it feels sticky with the rice in my mouth. And the sushi rolls were the worst I've ever had. Well, since I've been to Japan I lot of times , I am a little picky about japanese cuisine. But the seaweed wrapping the sushi was too wet, usually when the cook prepare it fresh, it should be a little bit crispy instead of what I got. I read the reviews on the website before I went there. I have to say that I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Simply put, the best sushi I've had in Toronto! 
I travel for work most of the year and I've had some amazing sushi, but always felt like Toronto was lacking a real great spot without having to dish out an arm and a leg. Great service, very small space (and maybe my only suggestion would be some louder music cuz it does get pretty quiet especially at the end of the night) and amazingggg Sushi, Sashimi, and rolls!"}
{"text":"3.5/5

ND Sushi and Grill is another sushi restaurant in the Baldwin Village strip, where U of T students seem to love hanging out due to its proximity to the campus. It's a small restaurant without much decorations, but I found the food here to be reasonable for what it's worth.

I ordered the sushi lunch, which came with a salad and soup. The salad was good, but the soup came out blazing hot. I had to wait about 5-10 minutes to cool down for me to finally drink it.

The sushi lunch had many unique fish, usually consisting of whatever fish special there are today. I had sockeye salmon and olive flounder in my set, which both tasted very nice. The regular salmon and tuna were also quite good. The rolls, unfortunately, while they tasted okay, were clumsily put.

Service was mediocre, and it was made worse with the fact the air conditioning was not working that day. The employees shrugged us off when we asked them whether they have a fan in the restaurant. To be fair, we probably could've eaten outside, but if we were told ahead of time the A/C wasn't working we would've requested an outdoors seat.

I will likely return because the food was indeed good, and hope by that time the A/C would be fixed. Heh heh."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times after it reopened at its new location and it's still very good. The restaurant looks smaller and the service is still on the slow side so don't think you'll be able to grab a quick bite but the servers are friendly and once you get your food, you'll forgive the wait because it's still amazing."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

This place doesn't look like much from the outside and I never thought to come here, with so many other great options on Baldwin. But when I came to Baldwin with a hankerin' for sushi and Etsu was closed, I decided to try this place out instead. 

On a Saturday night, the place was pretty busy. Luckily, my DC and I managed to get a table without a reservation. The space is quite small and intimate. Our server was cheerful and friendly, getting some green tea for us right away. The menu is pretty simple. It's mostly a la carte for dinner (no bento boxes), with a few sushi and sashimi platters in the ~$15-25 range. As others have mentioned, they also offer a $50 omakase menu for groups of 2 or more. 

I found the prices to be very reasonable and the quality of the ingredients and nice presentation were better than I expected from such a casual looking place. We had:
- Agedashi tofu - good size for 2. The shaved radish has a nice ginger flavour in it. 
- Tempura appetizer - my litmus test for a good Japanese restaurant, and they passed! Nice and light, and the tempura sauce was delicately flavoured. You get 2 shrimp and assorted veggies (asparagus, yam, this purple root vegetable). 
- Grilled eggplant - not on the regular menu, but a special. It's a whole eggplant, so it's actually really big. It came with some of the shaved radish and bonito flakes, similar to the agedashi tofu. 
- DC had the sashimi B combo and said it was very tasty and fresh
- Spicy salmon roll - great, with not too much rice or too much tempura bits. Avocado with the salmon was a nice combo of textures.
- Vegetarian futomaki - egg, tofu, shiitake mushrooms, slivers of green onion... proof that veggie rolls don't have to be boring

Only a couple minor things I think could be improved: timing of dishes coming out could be better coordinated (my DC's sashimi and my sushi rolls came ~15 minutes apart), and they could refill the green tea more frequently so that it doesn't get cold. Otherwise, very happy with our experience here! All this at $50 for 2 people, including tax. We left very full and I think we'll be back. Next time, I'll be sure to save room for dessert (black sesame ice cream, green tea panna cotta...)."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Baldwin village. This restaurant has delicious fresh sushi and sashimi. I really enjoyed the chirashi! The restaurant is small but cozy. I have been for both lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Great value and offers the great variety of fresh fish. Recommend over all other \"regular\" sushi restaurants that offer $20 sashimi/sushi dinners.

The $22 sashimi A platter had a great variety including fluke, tuna, salmon belly, albacore, sockeye and mackerel."}
{"text":"*A tiny shop located next to McRamyun. 
*Staffs are Japanese and really attentive. 
*The decoration was modern and chic. 
*There is also a patio at the front 
*Def make reservation as restaurant was slowly filling up after 5PM. 

Chirashi is usually my first choice when I go to a sushi restaurant, as I believe that is the best way to check the freshness and quality of an establishment :). Usually restaurants tend to give cheap fillers such as tamago or imitation crab in a chirashi, and if I have to pay $20 for that, it's a rip off. However I was impressed upon receiving my chirashi don at ND Sushi as I saw some good cuts of fish :).

For my bowl of Chirashi don, I received tuna; salmon; sweet shrimp; squid; salmon roe; eel; escolar.

For $20, I wished they have given me more tuna or sweet shrimp instead of salmon (or eel). With that said, all the fishes were fresh, soft and you can taste each of their distinct flavor. The rice was surprisingly good as well with a perfect consistency, and had a nice balance of sweet and sour. For some reason, the salmon fish roe had a strong fishy smell to it, as if it wasn't fresh anymore."}
{"text":"The food and presentation were very good and the place was clean and all, but that's it for positive comments from me.

The service wasn't particularly good and kind of ruined it for me, though it might've been just one particular waitress. It wasn't as though she was rude or anything, she just seemed exceedingly incompetent. Orders were mixed up, everything was kind of slow, she didn't seem particularly attentive, etc.

At one point she tipped over a lady's teacup on the table next to ours and spilled the tea all over her lap. Customer was pretty pissed, I wasn't really surprised that it happened."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I even wonder if I'm being too generous with a 2-star review.  I am not sure if it's that they're understaffed or just not very organized, but the service left a great deal to be desired. 

Terrible service aside, let's move on to the importance of size.  It could be the most delicious sushi on the face of the earth (I am not saying that this was), but if I can't fit it in my mouth? We've got a major issue. I ordered the house roll and it was sliced into ridiculously nonuniform pieces.  One of the pieces was so large that it was seriously nearly the size of a tennis ball. Think about trying to fit a tennis ball into your mouth. Now think about trying to chew and swallow that tennis ball in a lady-like fashion in front of your dining companions. It's not possible and it's certainly NOT pretty.  

We had a time constraint since we were going to a concert after dinner. I made our reservation at 6:30 thinking that would give us plenty of time to get to the show by 8:30 since it was down the street.  It took ages to get our bill and when we requested separate bills they told us we could either wait 1/2 an hour for them to get around to separating it, or just do it ourselves. Talk about unreasonable and irritating! We were a table of 4, so we really weren't asking for much at all.

The food that I was able to eat was okay, but certainly not the best sushi I've ever had.  One of my stars is based purely on the $4 beer...not really what is meant to be alluring about a sushi place, but I am happy that they provide something cheap to wash down those mammoth choking hazards."}
{"text":"My wife just took me for my birthday dinner here where we got their omakase set dinner. We've come many nights before for non-omakase dinners and they always never disappoint. At $60, the omakase meal is hard to beat.  The six course meal included a fresh scallop sashimi salad, ahi tuna steak, and crispy sea bream. They were also very liberal with the in season (and usually quite expensive) uni on quite a few of their dishes which my wife and I both love.  Overall, a great meal at a good value."}
{"text":"One of the top sushi restaurants downtown for sure, always fresh and delicious. Try to blue ocean maki roll, amazing!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I love this place.  It's my favorite sushi restaurant in Toronto, and if it wasn't inconsistent at times it'd be an easy five stars.  ND Sushi & Grill does high-end sushi the way I want it - fresh fish, expertly sliced and prepared, with bold flavors where bold flavors should be and subtlety where appropriate.  There are few bombastic, sensationalized offerings here: it's largely about the fish, and the selection is usually very seasonable and leaning towards what's good on any given week.  That being the case the menu rotates often, and can even be a little sparse when the local availability of topnotch fish only allows for a limited range of offerings.  Some things you want may not always be offered here, like uni and otoro.

If you're familiar with places like Japango and Wow Sushi, the actual size of the nigiri here may be surprising; they're far larger, with big slabs of fish draped languidly over each portion of rice.  Every piece of nigiri's a mouthful, ensuring that the fish makes contact with every part of your tongue and that you fully appreciate the textures on display.  

The value here's very good, especially for lunch.  They do a sushi lunch special for twelve bucks that keeps me coming back, which includes a miso soup that's on the high end of average; a surprisingly delightful salad; a California Roll that bespeaks far more care than the usual throwaway filler sushi lunchers have come to expect; and five pieces of nigiri.  The nigiri changes all the time, but the set pictured below included delicate hirame that tasted lightly of the sea; buttery red snapper with a bit of a firmer texture and a deeper flavor of ocean brine; perfectly fresh maguro that just dissipated in my mouth with an almost tart aspect to the finish; buttery and mild sockeye salmon, caught in the wild and plucked straight off that day's special board; and a conventional farmed salmon that offered pleasant contrast.  Other days the lunch has included stuff like hamachi, kampachi, and albacore, the latter being the only underwhelming offering (I've never been excited by albacore sushi and find it to be nearly flavourless).

The Dynamite Roll is a high-end take on the kind-of-trashy-but-still-delicious classic, and it's huge; it's prepared as a futomaki and packed with crab to augment the tempura'd prawn, hence the size.  Really good.  On the other end of the scale, the Blue Ocean Roll is subtle and wonderful, letting the sweetness of hokkaido scallop play against the rich background of avocado, and framing the flavours with the salty crunch of a little tobiko.  It's simple, but it's outstanding and it's a must-order in my mind. 

I've never had to wait for a seat here, for lunch or dinner hours.  I don't know how that's possible; do people just ignore Baldwin Village?  That's a shame, because there's some great food in the area, and I find it touch to believe since Kinton Ramen is /right/ there and gets a ton of press.  I dunno.  But regardless, this place is super-convenient and I've never needed to place a reservation.

I've only had one bad experience at ND Sushi, which sadly struck when I took a group here to grab lunch during TIFF.  It was pretty abysmal; we got a couple rolls a la carte, which were great as usual, but the sushi lunch was... not the paradise I just described above.  The california, usually a cut above other sushi lunches, was oddly unbalanced and ham-handedly assembled.  The fish was flavorless, and regular ol' sake appeared twice out of the five pieces of nigiri.  I've never had that happen before, and it was frankly embarrassing to tell my party about this awesome sushi place I'd been going to twice a week for a couple months, and then show up and be so totally let down.

Of course, it hasn't happened since.  Maybe they were really busy during TIFF, but still, it was disappointing to have to knock what would've been a five-star review down to a four.   Still, probably my favorite sushi place in Toronto, minus Hiro and Jabistro which are still on my to-do list."}
{"text":"Eating lunch this afternoon at ND Sushi & Grill makes me felt like I am the rich and famous because I have my personal chef and waitress serving me and cooking for me! :) 

The deco is nice and chic. More European bistro looking than a traditional Japanese restaurant. I think this will be a nice and quiet place to have a romantic dinner as the lighting is really gentle with no harsh spotlights! 

The lunch menu is reasonable between $9-$12 includes miso soup and salad. Salad is a mixed field green tossed in light vignette dressing. The sushi lunch ($12) has 5 pieces nigiri Sushi and 6 pieces California roll. The fish are fresh and sushi nicely presented. The nigiri that has shiso though a nice touch to enhance the taste but just that the shiso is out of portion thus affect the taste. Love the seared Butterfly fish nigiri! The California roll was rolled pretty loose and not too uniformed.. so they were falling apart if I don't pick them up gently. 

The full menu are really interesting. I would love to be back to try out some of their grilled entrees especially the Black Cod with a Fusion twist. They do offered fix menu for $35 and Omakase menu for $80. The cooking style here is supposed to be Japanese with a French twist.. 

Waitress is nice and friendly! Gee and she recognized me asking if I am Jennifer the one that took the photos of their storefront! :P 

They accepts Visa and Mastercard only!"}
{"text":"This is a small joint close to U of T. The quality of food and service was extraordinary! We had the spicy salmon rolls, spicy rainbow rolls and chirashi sushi (assorted sashimi). I was a bit hesitant about the spicy salmon rolls because they are made with salmon as well as avocado, but they ended up being the best I've ever had. The salmon was fresh and melted in my mouth! The spicy rainbow roll was flavourful. I usually don't like sushi with a cooked component, but I did this time. The chirashi sushi was incredible. It was composed of fresh assorted sea food. Don't know what half of it was but it sure tasted great. Good stuff ND! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"**THEY ARE CLOSING! Last day is December 17 as posted on their FB page. They decided not to renew their lease but they have mentioned their plans to open a new location downtown in Fall 2017. Consider paying them the last visit before they shut down here though.**

I'm a fan of this joint. Simple, fresh, high quality, all you would want to tame your Sushi/sashimi craving. The menu has just enough variety so you don't need to overthink too much with a long menu. 

Feeling like sushi? The House roll is a definite crowd pleaser. It can also fill as a meal for one person. 
Spicy salmon bibim is also a good choice if you want variety. It comes with salad, salmon and rice.

It's one of the best moderately priced sushi joints downtown. A decent bang for your buck without sacrificing quality. 

When my friends come to visit, this seems like a go-to if we feel like Japanese. I haven't written a review on here before because as you can see the track record here is consistently great so really no news here. I'm so sad! You know the saying... you don't know what you have until it's gone."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I almost kind of don't want to give it a good review so that it doesn't become too popular, although it is usually quite full on the weekends! 

Try the maguro tataki, and of course, the spicy rainbow roll. I don't think I've ever left here without an order of each of those. The service is friendly and the prices are reasonable. Great value for money, great for dates or even groups! All ahead on Friday or Saturday nights, especially if you're with a larger group since the seating is quite limited (~22 seats maybe?)"}
{"text":"The spicy rainbow roll was good. The spicy salmon was mediocre and so was the spider roll. The food took quite long to come out. Overall, not impressed considering the price."}
{"text":"Located in a small storefront on the north side of College Street just across from Bellevue Avenue the place is long, narrow and spartan. The windows look south onto College Street with the kitchen and sushi preparation in the back. The place is simple and straightforward with everything on the menu a la carte. This means you pay for everything, including tea, rice and miso. The boutique prices are expensive for the quality of the food and odd for the location. Other restaurants have tried to survive in the location but it is just too far away for university students and the tourists of Kensington, too pricey for elementary school students and too precious for those who live in the neighbourhood. I would be surprised if they survive the year."}
{"text":"Amazingly fresh. Great service and very authentic. I will definitely go back here anytime I'm in the area. The chefs recommendation is where it's at!!"}
