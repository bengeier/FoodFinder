{"text":"Great little restaurant lots staff, very attentive,super clean and most important the variety of dishes that we all had were delicious ,first time there and will become my new favourite  for sure.you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to. Tempura is so light and script. Sashimi is amazing. Stampede roll is delicious. Soft shell crab rolls too!!"}
{"text":"Called 35min before they were closing for pick-up, was happy to hear that they would still take our order (and were polite and flexible about it!)
The Spicy Crunch Salmon and the Dynamite rolls were delish- nice size, nicely made, and super tasty!
Will order again."}
{"text":"I frequent Haru, as it's within blocks of my house. It's definitely not the best, and if I wasn't so lazy on Friday nights, I'd drive further for better. The service is always so-so, last night it was downright terrible. The food is good, reasonably priced (as far as veggie sushi goes) and fast, but the service really ruins it for me."}
{"text":"Very good service and quality! Clean place. Love it! Will be back for sure. Everything was prepared and made well."}
{"text":"Another dinner at Haru - sushi is fresh and service friendly. Tempura very good too!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place it town...and I have tried a lot of them! The staff are crazy nice and have even memorized my order. The decor is modern and very clean. It gets very busy on the weekends so go early....I only wish that they were open on Mondays! Try their potato croquettes....they are SO yummy!"}
{"text":"I've had 2 experiences with Haru Sushi & Grill and both have been great!  Their service is phenomenal and so very helpful! Love their sushi so much as well as their teriyaki beef. Definitely worth checking out for take out or dine in!"}
{"text":"I always stop by here after work. Ordering to-go here is very convenient and fast. Sometimes they don't pick up the phone but that might be because their getting so many to-go calls. I usually always get them on the 2nd or 3rd try. The food here isn't the best sushi I've ever had, but hey; the service is wonderful, it's fast and easy to pop in and grab your order and be outta there in 5 mins, and their dynamite roll is delicious!"}
{"text":"Haru upon entering is a very suburban like sushi joint, as far as decor goes. It's big, has a lot of dark wood and only an essence of Japanese design. This would typically make me think the sushi would be quite mediocre, as I'm pretty harsh when it comes to ethnic food found in the deep, new suburban areas. 
I was absolutely wrong. The service was fantastic and while the menu is pretty standard fare, the quality for the price was outstanding. I don't usually go for just sashimi, but the salmon and tuna were so tender, and light. There was no whiff of fish smell or wasabi hidden underneath with the rice to try hide a lack of quality in the food. This was melt in your mouth goodness. The spicy prawn roll was also a hilite. So much crunch and just a smattering of hot sauce to kick up the flavour a notch. My favourite part of the meal was the green tea ice cream. The presentation was well done, coming in two triangle shapes with a drizzle of light chocolate sauce and some crunchy sweet potato flakes on top, which added another level of texture. I don't tend to venture down this far south, but it's definitely a must for those living closer by."}
{"text":"Great place to eat close to home. Food is awesome. The only thing that earkes me is we went there for lunch and the girlfriend wanted to get tempura and the waitress said it was too late to get it.....that was fine. A guy and his two kids came in after we were 1/2 way done our meal....he ordered tempura and I was like wtf!"}
{"text":"Love Haru its a great little sushi place
Just wish there hours were a little better!
All the rolls are delicious
Nice envirment too!"}
{"text":"I went here with my daughter and arrived 5 mins before they opened. My 4 year old daughter desperately had to use the washroom and one of the employees was standing on the other side of the door staring at me but would not open the door. I knocked and when he opened it a little I asked if my daughter could please use the washroom and he said no. I left and will not go back. Customer service matters!"}
{"text":"Great sushi- fantastic stampede roll- great take out- also great dine in service - we go honestly at least every few weeks!!! Won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to the gem of a restaurant a few years ago and I'm glad she did.

We love coming here for really good food and great service.
We always get a combination of sashimi, rolls, fried stuff and appetizers and to this day everything I've  tried has been great.
We've never been able to have desert yet because we always stuff our faces before...

Price wise I am happy - I've been to lots of other places where they charge double for some of the items. 

The restaurant is always busy, I recommend making a reservation ."}
{"text":"There are so many sushi restaurants these days that it's hard to set yourself apart from the rest. Haru Sushi was pretty good, but overall it doesn't stand out for me... except for the Nacho Cheese Roll. I want to give it a 3.5 instead of a 4.

I'll give two thumbs up for the salmon nigiri. This place uses very good fish for their sushi. It was was a very memorable salmon nigiri experience. Mmmmm. So tender and yummy. But for some reason, my date and I thought it was a good idea to order the Nacho Cheese Roll. Let me tell you, there's a reason why cheese is never paired with rice or fish... or seaweed. Otherwise everything else was pretty good.

The price was on par with everywhere else, the quality of the fish was pretty good, the service was decent. I would definitely recommend this place for people who live in the area and are looking for a Japanese restaurant. However, I don't think I would go out of my way to eat there since there are equally good places that are closer to me."}
{"text":"How do I give it less than 1 star. Menu is vague, and service was atrocious. Left after not getting water for 15 minutes. Yelp me out here and shut em down."}
{"text":"Their sushi is good but a little pricey. Service was good- the server was always checking up on us if we need something. Would go back here."}
{"text":"Haru Sushi & Grill is our absolute favourite sushi restaurant in Calgary. The staff are very friendly and quick to serve you. The menu offers a lot of choice for appetizers, rolls, sashimi, teriyaki dishes, udon soup, tempura, combos and much more! The sashimi is phenomenal, you consistently get big, fresh pieces at a reasonable price (for example: 3 pieces salmon, 3 pieces tuna for around $11). Haru offers a good lunch menu as well with a variety of choices at various price points.
We always leave Haru with full bellies and happy smiles!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner and we were the only customers in the whole place - food was subpar - took too long - service is slow - small menu and they ran out of one dish - nice interior - weird layout - lots of wasted space at entrance - will not go back"}
{"text":"WOW!! This was great sushi. The service and food were excellent. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout a few times since my first review so I thought I should do an update.  The food is still as good as ever and I've found a new roll that I love:  the Chicken Katsu Roll.  Delicious!   

One thing I must say - I do wish they were open until at least 10 p.m. on Saturdays but that's just how Calgary seems to be.  One must dine earlier than later in this city, as a whole.  Here it is 9:25 p.m. and we'd love to put in an order but, alas, we're out of luck tonight.  Doesn't change my rating, though."}
{"text":"Was excited to see that a Haru opened up in the Beltline as I had visited the location in McKenzie Towne a few times and really enjoyed the food there. First off the restaurant is beautiful and quite big. We went right when the restaurant opened on a weeknight for an early dinner so we were one of two tables being served. After looking through their menu I found that there were some items missing from the location in McKenzie Towne which was disappointing. We ordered the Aburi Tuna roll, Spicy Prawn roll, Salmon Aburi, Prawn Tempura and Tonkatsu (breaded pork). Food overall was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I'd say it's a good option to go to especially since there are not many sushi restaurants on this side of downtown. But I myself would probably be more inclined to drive somewhere else if I had a sushi craving. Hoping though that with more time that Haru get's better."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, Good service and the sushi is tasty. Great option since there are only a few sushi places in the area"}
{"text":"Great food very busy when we went I say it the best sushi I have in Calgary"}
{"text":"I recommend 4 stars as an active member of the Yelp community. I am definitely a sushi foodie and the weight of my review is greater than someone who only goes out once a year or than your neighbour who you hardly know. Sushi good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here. The teriyaki chicken is gluten free and it is delicious. We have never had a bad experience at this place. There are two sides to this restaurant , they usually place families on one side and couples/childless groups on the other side on busy nights which is greatly appreciated. The food and service here is fantastic, my boyfriend and I come all the way from across town just to eat here."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for something you could get at Kinjo for much cheaper... The food didn't taste great and was really just disappointing. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"November Challenge - 16/30

Haru is a sushi place nestled in Mackenzie Towne. It's pretty inside, very IKEA-esque, with pleasant wait staff and food that comes out at lightning speeds.

I ordered the spinach gomae and got a ball of spinach smothered in their sesame dressing. It was like someone had started to pour the dressing on and took a phonecall mid-pour, then realized they had to serve it, saw there was no spinach left, and decided, eff-it; here you go! While the dressing was tasty, it was the equivalent of eating soggy spinach in cold gravy. 

The veggie tempura was delicious. I appreciated that it wasn't one giant slice of sweet potato, a bunch of undercooked onions and mushrooms, and a piece of broccoli that's too big to eat elegantly. That's usually the assorted veggie tempura I've come to expect from most sushi places in town. Haru's assorted veggie tempura had pumpkin, asparagus, mushrooms and sweet potatoes, and it was crispy and not greasy in the least.

Their veggie tempura and avocado rolls were my favorite of everything that I had ordered. There was a decent rice to filling ratio, and the avocado was appropriately buttery. My friend ordered their takoyaki, tuna and salmon sashimi. He said that it was decent, but not the best; out of the three, the takoyaki was the the best. 

The waitress was also unaware if they carried unfiltered sake or not, but I did appreciate that she brought out the warm (read: molten lava-esque) sake wrapped in a little napkin kimono to protect his fingers. My teacup was not wrapped and was nuclear to the touch, but I liked the slightly smoky flavor of their green tea. 

All in all, this is a decent mid-range sushi restaurant in the middle of suburbia. A place for soccer moms to escape, and treat their preschoolers to something that isn't baby carrots and kraft dinner. I know, because they were there."}
{"text":"The restaurant is well decorated and lit, very nice space. Reminds me of a hotel restaurant. Though the sushi was good, I wouldn`t say it blew me away. 

My party had the shrimp tempura and BBQ squid to start, both good options. The tempura came out hot and crunchy, with the expected tempura sauce. The BBQ squid was served on a sizzling plate and was quite nice in terms of the texture and mouth feel.

I won`t list all the rolls we had but honestly it`s the same sushi here that you`ll find anywhere else in the city. However, I will say that the portion size was good considering the price of the rolls and we all came away quite full."}
{"text":"Came for lunch.

I wish the lunch menu offered more choices.  In particular, I'd like to select which kind of roll comes with my sushi.  Haru needs to learn that not everyone likes California rolls.

This could have been a 5 star rating if Haru let me select a 3 roll lunch special, where I select which rolls I want (e.g. Salmon & Avocado).

The salad that came with the lunch was poor quality.

I liked the free hot green tea.

Service is fast and efficient."}
{"text":"I've been going to Haru Sushi in McKenzie Towne since the week they opened. They were amazing right out of the gate... one of my favourite sushi places in Calgary. Portion sizes, food quality, great staff, and appealing venue.

Over the last two years, everything has declined. Last week was probably our last visit if things stay the same. 

We've gone from eating (eating in or take out) 3-4 times a month to once a month at best.

Onsite customer service has been okay however they seem to be quite indifferent on the phone when we order takeout.  When we call for takeout, they used to always answer the phone, there would be a lot of enthusiasm, their system would call up our previous order, etc. Now, answering the phone is hit and miss and they no longer see us as a frequent customer. 

Food quality has significantly declined. Often, when ordering rolls, ie: Rainbow Roll, the tuna is still slightly frozen. The seaweed in their rolls has been rather chewy lately and the stickiness of their rice is 50/50... will it stay together or not???

Portions sizes have gotten smaller... 

Lastly, regarding food quality, the freshness of the sushi/sashimi has really declined to the point where I really believe it's on par with fast food like Edo Japan.

The venue is a little run down and requires some TLC. A simple paint job and spot repairs are all it needs - otherwise, the place is clean.

They use to serve food on porcelain dishes... now, cheap plastic dishes that you would expect in fewer quality establishments. 

I hope they do. Haru used to be a venue of choice... then it slid to a venue of convenience... and now it's neither.

The good news is, all of these issues are easy to fix... I just gave you all the answers to make improvements."}
{"text":"Had a Fantastic Meal here last night! Everything was so fresh and the service is quick and very friendly. The Haru platter was to die for."}
{"text":"Haru is a great place for lunch as it's inexpensive but I will let you all know that dinner is Farley pricy.  But the food is great and the service is amazing!"}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered for pick up. When we went to grab our food, the staff were so friendly! The sushi was amazing! We had spicy shrimp rolls, a calafornia roll, a spider roll, a dynamite roll, some salmon sushis and some sashimi. Oh, and some tempura. What! We were hungry!!!

Anyway, the food was beautifully prepared and awesomely fresh. the sashimi came in large delicious pieces. I was really impressed! 

The restaurant itself is a tad on the simple side, but there are lots of tables and it was really clean!"}
{"text":"I like the location of this sushi restaurant as it is very close (within walking distance to my house), however, it is a very small sushi restaurant. The tables are all very close together. SO close in fact that people have trouble getting in and out or leaving to go to the washroom. 
In addition to this, I felt like only either a salmon tataki or a tuna tataki for dinner so I asked the waiter what the sauce was that is put on the tatakis and he did not know so he said he would check with the chefs and come back and let me know. When the waiter came back he told me the names of them but not what was in them (which is what I was really interested in knowing. When he did come back after talking to the chefs he had a detailed list of every ingredient in each sauce down to water which I wasn't expecting but I did appreciate it. I was just basically wanting to know whether the sauce would taste- spicy, lemony or dilly. 
In addition to this I didn't really like that the \"typical;\" sushi rolls such as a California roll or dynamite roll doesn't come in just 4 pieces but only a minimum of 8."}
{"text":"We ordered a sushi combo, beef tataki, scallop rolls, and more. Their raw fish is not fresh and was hard to stomach. The beef tataki was a joke as the beef tasted like it was frozen and sliced not long before because the sauce tasted like thawed raw beef. They couldn't even get their scallop rolls right because they put in some pickled veggie and have a strange miracle whip sauce loaded on top. With a bill coming close to $100 and food WORSE than food court quality, I suggest you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Have you ever wondered what an unwashed gym sock would taste like surrounded by rice? Have you ever looked at 4 crisp 20$ bills and thought - \"I won't be needing those for anything important\", well then have I got a recommendation for you!! 
Located in the heart of Mckenzie Towne - is this hidden crap box. You don't have to drive far to feel cheated and disgusted simultaneously thanks to Haru. 
I've had better sushi rolled by blind Italians."}
{"text":"great food good prices, hard to  understand sometimes makes a conversation piece. Been there 50 times always fresh and great value"}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in Calgary!!! 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Atmosphere outstanding. Friendly service and very clean restaurant. 

Free parking as it's in Mckenzie Towne. On the pricy side of sushi in Calgary but worth it. 

Only thing holding it back from 5 star is the inconsistent rolling of the sushi. Not tight for the larger rolls. 

Family friendly."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE

I am literally sitting in the restaurant writing this review.  Who puts a dollop of mayo on sushi?   Very friendly people, terrible food."}
{"text":"Haru Sushi Bar is located at McKenzie Towne Ave SE Calgary, which is 10 minutes away from my home. 2017. 12.01. After the Christmas Concert, my boyfriend took me to Haru Sushi Bar for dinner. It was our first time, came to this restaurant. Before we came here, we did research online. I found that Haru Sushi has a great rating on both Google and Zomato review. In this way, my boyfriend decided to take me here for dinner.

We arrived the restaurant around 7:30 pm, which was right at the dinner time. The restaurant was full and busy. Luckily, we still found a table. After we sat down, the server brought the menu and drinks our table. The menu looks very fancy and has pictures on it, which is more convenience for us. The prices of food are a little bit expensive.  We had CALAMARI, TERIYAKI BEEF, and Two special sushi rolls to share. The food came out fast and fresh. The Calamari was very fresh and soft different from what we thought. But, the taste of it was so salty. Beef Teriyaki was grill beef and mixed vegetable which is different from what we ate before too, but the taste was great. Two special rolls were tasted decent. Nothing excited comparing with special sushi rolls in any of sushi restaurants in Vancouver. We were a little bit disappointed with our meal.  The server was very nice and friendly. The environment was clean and peaceful. In summary, it was a new experience having sushi in Calgary."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience. Attentive service, Great food and fresh delicious sushi rolls and sashimi every time. Always our first pick for a good, refreshing dinner!"}
{"text":"My new go-to for sushi!

I've eaten at Haru a dozen times since it opened.  I think it's the best sushi in the city. It's always fresh, quality is consistent and prices are reasonable. They have a large variety of rolls to choose from. Many of which are the more traditional rolls which I prefer.  They also have the negi-toro and negi-hamachi maki which are my favourite (not a lot of restaurants offer them) as well, they serve white ginger. 

The decor is warm and the restaurant is always clean, and service has always been pleasant and fast. It's also a great place for take-away."}
{"text":"great place to go on a date, can get busy during rush hour and a little noisy.  But busy is a sign that it is popular and it has something good.  

A little better than Kinjo but not as trendy, and  not as good as Ki Japanese restaurant and not as expensive either.

Overall a hearty recommendation."}
{"text":"I used to go at least once a week but I got serious food poisoning during my last visit. I've never been so sick. I had ordered the gomai, California roll and dynamite roll. Not sure which dish caused it but I'm not sure I can return. The food has suffered a serious decline in quality in the last year."}
{"text":"I live in a building close and I've been 4 different times because of that and honestly each time I kept telling myself it's not worth the convenience. The sushi rolls are small, everything isn't that good on the menu. The service is crap, they don't speak very good English AT ALL, that being said good luck knowing what they put on the table they mumble, it's annoying. 
Anyways, TOO expensive for what it is.
Beautiful interior and a great location BUT put the effort in the food and drinks and the owner would make a killing here.  3/10 food isn't good, no alcohol, service is bad."}
{"text":"Sush-eh! Yeah, I'm a fan. I was meetin' a friend for lunch and I wondered, \"Where in the world will we go? Oh wait... I think I know a website that can help with that!\"

Easy peazy. I ordered the assorted sushi lunch combo - Tuna, Salmon, EBI, TAMAGO, Snaper & California roll. Just as the name says, it was a good *assortment*!

Eat in or take out, Haru's a solid (or mushy?) sushi choice!"}
{"text":"The sushi rice was hard.  Either undercooked or they had refrigerated it prior to using.  Sooo unpleasant.  If you're a sushi restaurant, making rice should be a non- issue.  Haha.  

We were there on a Friday night and only 3 tables occupied which is a shame cuz the place is totally new and nice inside.  

The rest of the food (cooked)  was either too salty or just plain meh. Udon noodle broth tasted basically of a lot of soy sauce in water.  Teriyaki chicken didn't even really look like Teriyaki chicken, looked more like a stir fry at a Canadian restaurant.  

They do have several restaurants in the city,  and I've been to the one McKenzie towne which I like.  I won't be coming back to this one though."}
{"text":"This place opened 4 months ago by the same owner as Haru Sushi in Springbank and Ajisai in Cranston & Panorama but this was my first experience with any of his restaurants.  Walking up to the building and not knowing what to expect,  I was pleasantly surprised by the clean, modern decor inside (and having lived in LA where there are lots of Korean owned sushi restaurants, I quickly recognized this as such).

Lots of staff with great service. Came here for lunch and ordered spicy tuna sashimi app ($3.95), Agedashi tofu ($4.95), and a spicy salmon roll ($6.95). What I had was all very yummm.  I was sooo stuffed :) 

I do have to say that I found it just a tad pricey (esp since not all of their lunch specials come with miso soup (or salad?)...so I opted to order from the menu instead of the lunch special.   I DO expect lunch combos to come with miso soup & salad.

Will Definitely come back for dinner sometime if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Haru Sushi & Grill is located in McKenzie Towne Avenue SE of Calgary.

After a long day of skiing, Spence didn't feel like going out and I was too tired to cook anything.  Spence was craving sushi and I didn't mind the idea either, we just wanted to find a place close by.  Spence's friend suggested Haru Sushi so we looked up the menu online.  They offered take out with a big selection of menu items.

As some of you know, we are very keen of Sakana Grill, and we found Haru Sushi to be very similar but with each of their own twists.  We ordered what we would usually order at Sakana Grill.  Dynamite rolls, Philadelphia rolls, Spicy tuna rolls, Tuna & Salmon sashimi, & miso soup.  

They told us to pick up our order around a half hour, and when we arrived it was all ready to go.  The lady at the front was welcoming with a big smile.   I also got a quick glance of what the dining area looked like and its very nice, dimmed lights with modern décor.  The preparation area is open, right at the front and center of the dining area, pretty neat to be able to see your meal get prepared.

Unpacking the containers, we found the food to be neatly packed.  They made sure presentation was there with garnishes of parsley, lettuce and oranges.  Finally, we dug into our food.  Spence really enjoyed the regular miso soup and wish he had gotten another one.  I enjoyed all the rolls, especially the Philadelphia rolls which was Cream cheese, pineapple wrapped with smoked salmon & mango.  I really enjoyed the pineapple inside, it's a little surprise...sweet and savory all in one bite!! The sashimi was also good, seemed pretty fresh!! All the stuff we ordered looked like it wouldn't fill us but it sure did!!

I would definitely recommend Haru Sushi if you live deep down south or if you're in the area!!  Next time, we're definitely going to try the dine in experience!!"}
{"text":"Haru has been open for about 2 weeks now. My wife and I are big sushi fans, with our fav being Shikiji. They have a long list of Appetizers. We started with the Spicy Tuna Sashimi and Gyoza. We really enjoyed both. There were also a few Appetizers that we would like to try in the future. We ordered 4 different sushi rolls, Spicy Tuna, Rainbow Roll, Dynamite Roll and Aburi Tuna Roll. They have a type of balsamic sauce that is used on the side of the Rainbow Roll, we both agreed the roll would have been better with out. The only other note was that the avocado was not ripe. It was actually a little tough in the roll, that was the first time I have encountered that. Overall, we enjoyed it and will try it again. They are newly opened and may be encountering typical opening jitters. I also found the price to be very fair with the bill coming to aprox $55."}
{"text":"As I am writing this review I am also  answering the additional Yelp specified questions. Yes HARU is fine for children who are who recognize that it is a primarily quiet, adult atmosphere and who like sushi. There is a kids menu but there are more kid-oriented restaurants in Calgary. 
We have been regulars here since the doors opened in Mckenzie Towne. The menu is a decent size with familiar favourites; tako yaki, salmon and tuna tataki and some unique twists on the scallop roll (sweet) and the hot kitchen \"ika\" (BBQ not deep fried). The service is impeccable. Our one critique is that the food has, over the last year, become inconsistent. How much if an item, how it will be presented, what sauce changes just enough to sometimes to disappoint (when looking for a particular item, for example). Overall this restaurant is worth visiting. I personally recommend trying as much as you can on the menu."}
{"text":"My brother is in town and we thought we'd get some sushi for something different. Sushi seems to be a little sparse in the east end, but we weren't keen on heading downtown. 
The hubs is the sushi guru in the family, so I leave the ordering up to him. 

I see all these faboo reviews and all I can say is \"meh\". I've had better sushi in Calgary, so this place wouldn't be my first choice. 

The taste was ok, but it just didn't seem to be up to the calibre of being great. For instance, one of our selections went a little bit overboard on the mayo garnish sauce. 
And it's kinda funny, I always was under the impression if you had one piece of fresh made sushi, you've had it all. It would seem that maybe isn't the case. 

Sorry, but \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Haru is a large comfortable restaurant with booths and tables, mostly booths. It's near Sunterra market downtown. 

The lunch menu was good. I liked it because you could choose from small medium large or really big lunch specials.

I chose a rice bowl. It is called Donburi, and it was a bowl of white sushi rice with salad greens as garnish and four pieces of large thin sushi-grade raw fish. The rice was fresh, sticky, perfectly white and perfectly sweet. I chose two pieces of salmon and two pieces tuna. To start, miso soup. The soup and the rice bowl was $9.99.

The miso soup was fresh, not with seaweed and perfectly square chunks of tofu like other restaurants - those are from packets. This was just miso with a tiny bit of scallion. The miso soup was sweet.

The hostess and waiter were both very nice. I got the feeling they didn't speak English very well, but there was no problem in that.

The ambiance was nice: Japanese Cherry Blossom trees (albeit artificial ... But lovely just the same), beautiful light fixtures and lots of natural light from the windows."}
{"text":"With all of the great reviews before me I must have caught these guys on a bad night tonight.

My wife doesn't do seafood so when she's out with the ladies its sushi time! I called at approximately 7:15. The lady that answered the phone didn't even wait for the call to pick up before she started into her \"please hold\" speech. All I got was \"...ind if you hold please?\" then a click. There's no hold music, no beep, just dead air. It makes you think you've been hung up on.

When she came back to my call a minute or so later she started to ask how she could help me but then started to talk to someone in the restaurant and without notice put me on hold again for a few seconds. Finally I got my order placed and was told it would be about 20 minutes. Sounds about right for a busy Friday night.

Picking up my order was quick. The same lady that answered the phone was at the front desk. She was mildly more friendly in person than over the phone. I was in and out as fast as the debit terminal could process the payment.

I went with the deluxe sushi combo. For $20 the portion size was good, but unfortunately the quality was not there. Most of the individual sushi items were just okay. One of them, which I believe was snapper, was definitely not very fresh. It was a little dry and had a slight odour. the dynamite roll was equally disappointing. Each piece fell apart when I picked it up and flavour wise it was meh.

Based on this experience there are definitely many other better sushi places in the city, but this one being the closest to my house means they'll get a second chance."}
{"text":"Haru doesn't have anything fancy on their menu, which is rather nice. The novelty of their food doesn't wear off bc they do not have to use gimmicks to draw you in. 

Food is consistently good. You know what you are going to get."}
{"text":"I love to give good reviews to the places which deserve them. I really do.

And Haru really deserves it.

Yes I live in McKenzie, but there's no bias - just sheer luck to have a great sushi place in the neighbourhood. I'd drive long distances if needed, glad I can just walk in.

Service is the best part of the experience - these guys are genuine, attentive, polite, and just fun to deal with - always smiling, friendly, jumping in to fulfil every need you may possibly have.

Good menu. I guess I've eaten all of it back and forth, and would love to see more items on it, but still - good stuff, enough to choose from for a while.

Needless to say, I've been to Haru almost every other weekend for more than a year, and neither me nor my wife had ever encounter something that won't be fresh and carefully prepared. We love that.

Another big plus is that Haru folks are so accommodating - when we arrive with our little one, they always help moving a stroller so it won't bother anyone, and give us a table which allows stuffing the baby seat in.

And the most important, it's not just about us, our family - we regularly observe the same level of respect and attention to the rest of the customers.

Good job Haru, and thanks for all the fish! ;-)

Well not yet though, as we'd surely return again and again..."}
