{"text":"I love that they offer an all-you-can-eat option as well as a-la-carte...

The best though is that their all-you-can-eat is still made to order and not buffet style. I'm not really a fan of buffets, especially sushi when you never know how long the food has been sitting out, so this was great!

Fresh, quick service, decent price... perfect for sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"Tried and tested all you can eat sushi lunch. Love coming here and stuffing my face with salmon sushi, seaweed salad, and experimenting with their various other fish-sushis!  Reasonably priced and nice aquarium at the entrance. I like!"}
{"text":"Modern touch, many staff not so friendly but they do their job right. The food comes very quick and sometimes they serve you someone else's order or vice versa. I have been going to this location since 2012. I am a regular customer and you would think I would be recognized by regular staff that always serves me but no! Anyways I go there for food and nothing else. Best part they add tip to your bill."}
{"text":"I love that place. Food is good. And the price is right as well. I go there every other Tuesday for dinner!! Oh,and the staffs are also getting better then before( services wise) !!"}
{"text":"The food is nice. Sushi and maki were very good for an AYCE sushi place, I would not recommend anything breaded and deep fried here (AKA temporas). Prices were reasonable and comparable to any AYCE sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"The food is good. We like the spicy salmon roll. The Service is fast but they are very grumpy. It seems it is against policy to smile or act friendly."}
{"text":"Due to the extremely high reviews, i went to this restaurant yesterday for lunch, and it was a disappointed. Maybe they have a different menu for lunch and dinner but it was very limited, a lot of the stuff that i use to eat at a regular AYCE have sashimi, smelt roe, and tuna nigiri. But for 11.99, what can you expect? The salmon and white tuna was not as fresh as I used to eat it...according to food regulation you should store sushi grade sushi at temp 40 degree F but when it came to the table it is room temperature and a little warm..."}
{"text":"Sushi is great, good value and best of all - fresh. The servers are always walking around and it's easy to flag one down however they can be slow at times bringing out the food. Most of the food is really good, especially the spicy salmon roll and the seaweed salad which are awesome!! \"Service charge\" (tip) is automatically added to your bill so I hope they are sharing their \"service charges\" with the chefs because the food is what keeps this place in business!"}
{"text":"There is a 10% service charge on the bill and they put a tip option on the machine as if there isn't already a service charge already. When I told them I didn't realize there was already a service charge, I saw and heard them laughing at me in the back. I guess I should have looked more carefully at the bill. But usually, service charge is up to the customer, right? They probably do that because they already know their service is horrible. Never going there again."}

- Attentive staff (don't expect nice service tho)
- Decent selection
- Food tastes OK.."}
{"text":"I had take out from here a few times, and from delivery to the take out itself and the prices, this place is great. The sashimi is amazing with choices too.

So, quite naturally I thought the dine in experience would be just as good. I came in on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend. He pretty much made fun of the menu from the get go. They offered chicken nuggets, onion rings, sweet and sour pork and all the basic chinese buffet type items. We ordered a chicken nugget for fun and expected something like McNuggets but instead the nugget was the size of my hand! We had two of them. D: I don't know if it was a mix up or if those really are the nuggets but those filled us up.

The sashimi were a disappointment. Basically, if you want anything besides salmon sashimi you can give up. The squid sashimi was not sashimi grade, but those fake squid things people usually add as a side to their ramen. The sushi were huuuge. Everything did not taste that fresh either. 

It was... really weird. The stuff I bought from take out were quality sashimi and good sized sushi but, but the dine in food was rather inferior in comparison. For this place, I'll stick with take out."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. The decor is cute, the space is small-medium; enough to keep the atmosphere below hectic and overwhelming :) I've been here about 10 times in the past few months.

The sushi is good, sliced a bit strangely (thin, sometimes jagged? not evenly slices). But sometimes we'll get an even fresher batch of salmon and that is just the most incredible orgasm in your mouth!! 

They pretty much let you choose the numbers of each items (how many shrimp tempuras, hand rolls etc.) instead of giving you a basket and the rest is thrown out. It places less pressure on the ordering. The rolls are an exception- they always come in 6's.

The lettuce roll was a strange concept, but delicious with the surf clam. Soft shell crab roll is my favourite sushi roll EVER and I have it everywhere- there's is very large and contains imimtation crab meat...why!? 

The dim sum is a funny little addition, but it's actually pretty good! So are the cheese mussels.

The service is basic; they serve, you eat, they bring the bill, you pay. They don't glamour it up with smiles and a \"what can I get for you?\" Sometimes they're a bit grumpy looking and talk to each other a bit too much, but it's not too bothersome. 

Overall, good place. They give VIP cards too that give 15% off ;) But then they make their 10% service charge mandatory on the bill...."}
{"text":"Unusually go to the lunch but this time I decided to go to the dinner.

The dinner costs a lot more than the lunch, it's literally twice as much and there's really not much addition to the menu so I suggest going to the lunch!!!

I love the sushi here, I'm not a fan of raw sushi but rolls like the California roll, spicy crab roll, mango roll and shrimp tempura roll are to die for! Absolutely love them!

Although it sounds weird the sushi pizza is so good! MUST TRY IT! It's just a rice patty and either salmon crabmeat or avocado on top!

I also love the fried rice (ask to get a small portion otherwise it'll be SO much!) and salmon teriyaki is great too

The service is not that great! I mean they're diligent workers but they give off an attitude and sometimes slam your food on your table and leave. It's ridiculous really especially since there's a 10% service charge.

Anyway, I love this place because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Do not ever go to this place. It's horrible -

Horrible service, The waiters look like they will end somebody's life.

Oh did I mention really bad food?-  (What the fuck- sushi with warm rice?!) 
Hard meat and damp seaweed.

Disgusting. I've been to so many all you can eat sushi restaurants- this one is a no-go. Srsly go somewhere else ."}
{"text":"It's actually quite sad, because this place used to be really good....like 5 stars worth. I think it's because of the change in management that happened late last year.

I went back just recently, and you can tell their rolls are not made with the same amount of care as before. Very inconsistent. Overall, the rolls have gotten a lot more saltier...

Service has gotten very bad as well. Their waiters used to be a lot nicer, but now they're quite rude, look unhappy all the time, and will throw plates on the table, and leave plates at the ledge of the table for you to move to the centre yourself. 

Sashimi was pretty much the same quality as before. Their shrimp tempura was as good as before as well. 

I used to LOVE this place, but now, it's like any other decent sushi AYCE places. I'd still eat here, but not as often, and with as much enthusiasm as before. They charge 20.99 for weekend dinner, which is on the low side (I guess it reflects their not-so-great location). You can find a 10% coupon on their website. Also, they only charge 10% service charge on your bill. I'd say if you didn't know the old Hockey Sushi, you would be pretty happy with the food, and the 10% discount.

A lot of people don't know about Arctic Roll, but they serve it for dinner, and all my friends who tried it loved it. Even though it has gotten saltier than before, it was still tasty...I don't think many other places have it."}
{"text":"i am really picky on sushi..

but this place is great. 

the best thing in here is shrimp tempura (it gets better and better)
dynamite roll, salmon sushi and shrimp skewer .

i visit here once a month every time!

best ayce!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, bland, no frills, all-you-can-eat sushi. Terrible service that resents the second time you're putting in an order - no matter what size your first order was. I suppose it's successful because people like to stuff their faces and it's all-you-can-eat, but I really wish this place did not exist.

1 star"}
{"text":"This place has nothing to do with hockey if anyone reading this is thinking that.

This place is cheaper compared to other AYCE places. You can even use a 10% off coupon that can be printed off their website for their dinner menu. Quality is decent, food is decent, salmon sashimi is actually pretty good and you can taste the quality so go for dinner and get full off 30 pieces of salmon sashimi!

One thing you should not get are their new 'Fried Wontons'. They're oily and they're barely filled with anything tasty inside. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.

The place gets pretty packed during dinner times and if you're unlucky enough, they'll place you by the window seats where there isn't any room whatsoever. The only reason I keep coming back is that it's a decent place but don't expect exceptional service or anything. Pop also used to be included in the AYCE menu but it isn't anymore but tea is free (as it should be).

Overall, 3/5. It's nothing special but isn't terribly disgusting either."}
{"text":"Food nothing special but service even worse. We Were literally kicked out 5 minutes to 11 because the restaurant closes at 11. Who kicks out their customers?? Waiters were talking about us, maybe cursing ? 5 of them tarted mopping right under our feet all together while we were eating.  Just disgusting! Not going back there again."}
{"text":"Not our favorite AYCE sushi place but pretty good. They did a decent renovation a couple years ago that was nice. 

Food - It really depends on the night. Sometimes the sushi is very fresh tasting and everything comes out fast and good and sometimes the sushi tastes dingy and stale and its not so good.

Service - Bad. But like all sushi places they just have bad customer service. They aren't friendly and are always forgetting part of the meal and for some reason they talk to eachother while they are taking your order so you're never sure if you should stop telling them your order and wait till they are finished or continue and hope you get everything. It's weird. They also walk around like they really don't care about anything and they aren't attentive so you have to stop them if you want something. 

All in all if you are looking for somewhere new to eat then check it out but otherwise stick to the classics."}
{"text":"We've been eating here for years. Within a 10km radius this is by far the best AYCE sushi place in the area. I'm sure there may be better places, but from what I have tried , this place is top 3. The price is within normal range compared to other AYCE. The service is about the same as others in the area, not excellent but not bad. The food is pretty good. We usual order the same items every time we go there (baby mushroom roll, shrimp tempura, seaweed salad, beef udon soup, a few hand rolls and sushi rolls, sushi pizza, beef teriyaki, Kalbi, shashimi and tofu). We never have problems with our order. They do charge 10% service charge on the bill already so you don't HAVE to tip extra. Will continue to come here."}
{"text":"This is one of the best all you can eat sushi we go to. Really great quality for the price. Nice variety. And I really love their sushi pizza and grilled eggplant. The reason I'm taking off one star is because they have pretty bad service. They don't smile and not always nice. Plus 10% gratitude is included in bill, which I never like. Tip is an option in my opinion and I hate when restaurants include it."}
{"text":"So like most people in Thornhill I used to go to Hockey Sushi pretty regularly. As sushi picked up popularity and so many new places opened up I decided to take my business elsewhere. Recently I've become re-acquainted and I would say that it beats most of the other options in the area. The prices are more reasonable, offerings more diverse and if you're eating in, the renovation has made the place quite nice again."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! It's situated in a small plaza that's easy to miss, but the food is great. I love all their sushi, and the portions are very generous. I ordered edamame separate from the all you can eat and I couldn't believe how much they gave me! I shared with 3 other people and we still couldn't finish all of it. Overall, it's a great little restaurant."}
{"text":"The new place is so nice . I went here everyday for the past week . The spicy crispy salmon roll is what make me want to come back more. Beef teriyaki wrapped in asparagus is to die for and everything else in the menu is simply amazing. This place is great for family , kids, or even by yourself. Real bang for your buck! 10/10 service may be slow but hey ENJOY YOUR FOOD"}
{"text":"3.5 stars = 4 stars for the sushi/maki, 3.5 for the kitchen food, 3 stars for the service.

Why this place is called Hockey Sushi is beyond me.  Perhaps they wanted to seperate themselves from their other AYCE brethrens that were named Sake or Wasabi or Yang's or Sakura, etcetc.  This place knows exactly how sushi and maki rolls should be made.  I'm all about the ratios when it comes to food and the rice to \"stuffing\" (as I like to call it) ratio was perfect. Sushi and maki rolls shouldn't be surrounded by a half an inch of rice (as ALOT of other (non)/AYCE places do). Nor should it be bathing in mayo to cover up the stench of bad fish.  Hockey Sushi does neither.  The best maki rolls there are the Dynamite rolls and Salmon & Avocado rolls.  They charge $1 for pop (recently added the price) and no sashimi during lunch (but that's typical of AYCE).  We went for lunch on Saturday and it was $11.99 pp (10% off with cash).  The price is the same for lunch whether its a weekend, weekday or Holiday so that's definitely a plus.  Alot of places jack up the price on weekends and holidays, which I think is completely bogus b/c the food's the same on weekends, if not worse.   

I give the cooked food a 3.5 because some dishes were questionable.  There was a \"new\" item on the menu called \"Japanese Wontons\" and it was basically a wonton skin folded into a triangle with a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny piece of shrimp stuffed inside and then deep fried like there was no tomorrow.  The shrimp tempura was off that day.  It was cold and not very crispy.   I think they deep fried a whole batch at once and served them as they were being ordered.  The best cooked dish was the Teriyaki Eggplant!  They give you half an entire eggplant and drizzle it with teriyaki sauce. IT WAS GOOD!!! 

Service gets 3 stars b/c all employees looked like they wanted to kill themselves.  But who wouldn't want to stick a pistol in their eye if they had to wait on a table with ten prepubescent Bieber fans.  Anyway, given that it was a full house on a weekend afternoon, the service was surprisingly fast.  I don't even like AYCE (I'm always under the notion that it's disgusting and everything is just mass produced), but Hockey Sushi is definitely one of those places that warrants an exception."}
{"text":"One  of my 2 favorite AYCE sushi places! Ive been coming  for years. The  staff, for most  part are friendly.  They  recognize me and always  give  me 10% off. They  appreciate  customer  loyalty!   Looooove the spicy  salmon  rolls!"}

{"text":"The sushi is what you expect. I find it very tasty & fresh.

The only draw back is the service. I have had to wait lenghty periods to order & it is a constant issue and I have both experienced & seen long waiting times to order even with only a few tables."}

{"text":"The AYCE sushi here is $21.99 on weekdays and 23.99 on weekends/holidays. 

Pros
-the menu has a huge selection 
-even though it is very busy you usually get a table fairly quick

Cons
- the spicy salmon sushi and spicy crab is filled with a mix of about 90% bread crumbs and 10% salmon/crab
-The servers can be rude and no matter what you order they always forget something every round
-the sushi is not very fresh 
-if you sit by the back there is a bit of a weird smell 

Overall i find this place a very mediocre sushi place. There are definitely better sushi places for less money"}
{"text":"Nice place and cozy. Stopped by with a friend for a few rolls and had a good time. Good food and ambiance. Especially enjoyed the eil avocado roll and the seafood fried rice. The only issue was the waitresses, took her forever to bring out the dishes and she wasn't too friendly. The place wasn't that packed."}
{"text":"I've gone to Hockey Sushi a number of times and it's OK. Not overwhelmingly positive, and not overwhelmingly negative.

Where they gained points:

- Their sushi is delicious. They have some items that I've never seen in other sushi places
- The staff are very friendly

Where they lost points:

- Service takes a bit too long, and the ipad that you use to order often seems to be malfunctioning. Because I'm a \"customer service snob\", I use my stopwatch to time how long it takes for the food to show up, from the moment I order to when it's on my table. Typically, it's around the 20-minute mark. This is even when it's not all that busy in there.
- Washroom cleanliness. Not the cleanest place. Paper on the floor, toilet seat has smudges on it. Not a good representation of the rest of the restaurant, which is quite tidy.

Anyways, I've been here before, and I'll go here again. It's not the best place I've ever been to, and it's not the worst. But overall, for me, the positives outweigh the negatives."}
{"text":"Will not be returning. 

The sushi was not fresh in my opinion and the floor was being mopped with filthy water that could be smelled from the tables. 

No thank you."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and every time, the food has been worse than the last. The quality is shockingly bad. The pieces of tuna sashimi I got didn't even resemble tuna...they were like nothing I've ever seen or smelled. They smelled like pieces of raw beef and looked like they've been frozen and thawed about 100 times. Maybe people go here because there aren't many good options in the area but I won't be back - it was seriously gross."}
{"text":"I was just there. Good quality sushi. But i am not impressed with their customer service at all. The waitresses are rude and impatient."}
{"text":"For an 'all you can eat' sushi joint Hockey Sushi is your run of the mill Eastern Conference playoff team. The food is decent to good compared to other 'all you can eat' places with a few superstar rolls on the roster including the: Spicy Salmon Roll and Shrimp Tempura roll. I don't recommend the sushi pizza or the general tao. Not ready to leave the bench, doo!"}
{"text":"I visited this place at a pretty bad time, 12pm, which is probably why my mood wasn't the best when we got our seat. The waiting area is small and can get packed really fast. 

That being said, the quality of sushi as well as the selection is admittedly a lot more superior to the other AYCEs I've tried around the GTA. The waitresses could have been a bit more pleasant and smiled more as they seemed very impatient while writing down our order. 

For sure if I'd arrived at a less busy time I would have had no complaint whatsoever. They do deserve fans and I am one of them now."}
{"text":"Hockey sushi ???? has a few locations but all owned by different owners therefore different menu, prices and promotions. Check out their website www.hockey sushi.com for other locations. They also have a 10% off coupon online you can print out. They used to give out physical VIP cards that offer you 10% off dine in only and cash only. But they give me 10% regardless if i show my card or not now (not sure if it's because they recognize me or they just give it to everyone).

They're sushi and sashimi is alright. I enjoy most that they have ikura sushi and squid sashimi since I eat by value. Half the time though they \"run out of\" ikura sushi after one or two orders. I have pictures of it uploaded; you can see you get what you pay for so they don't give you a heaping load of ikura. 

They have liquor license and hot sake is relatively cheap - large sake for $7.50. I believe they used to use sho chiku bai but might have switched out now. Soft drinks are not included in the ayce price. 

They offer two dim sum choices too (siu mai and har gau). Not amazing but if you crave it i guess it's worth 15 mins wait time. 
They have two bathrooms which most people dont know. There's the one unisex stall at main level but if you go downstairs by the main entrance there are actually more bathrooms.

I have been coming here for many years now (mainly for the ikura) since they're decent for an ayce. Give them a try they're okay. Check out the pictures I post to help you decide.

Oh 10% service charge is ALREADY INCLUDED IN YOUR BILL ... just an FYI :)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place on recommendation by a friend but the Guelph location. Visited the Thornhill location and it too has incredibly delicious food! Very fresh and delicious. The only downside is they don't have French fries at the Thornhill location, only onion rings (yes, we are Canadians who go to eat massive amounts of vegetarian sushi, teriyaki meats, spring rolls and fries) 

The waitresses aren't very friendly but that doesn't bother me, I go for the food and as long as my first order is large, I'm not very bothered when it's harder to get them back to order more food.

** Be sure to print the 10% off coupon from their website and also don't forget a 10% service charge has already been built into the prices (it states this on the menu) so don't feel obligated to pay any more than an extra 5% unless you are feeling giddy on sake ;)  I only noticed this fine print today, in the past I added 15-20% to the bill automatically. 

5+ stars on having a website and full menu details. If more AYCE Japanese restaurants had this, they wouldn't all have to resort to reduced staff making the experience annoyingly slow for patrons, selling discounted certificates and treating said customers with even less attention and/or filing for much deserved bankruptcy."}
{"text":"--This review is strictly about the sushi dishes--

Going here is a complete roll of the dice.

One day their food will be nice and fresh and the next you will 'enjoy' smelly fish.

Without consistency, I cannot recommend this to anyone.

{"text":"My favorite AYCE sushi restaurant in my neighborhood. Decent price for quality sushi. Salmon roses are a must."}
{"text":"I came here for their weekday lunch buffet ($17.39 incld tax/gratuity), the website AYCE menu is inaccurate and displays the dinner version so when I came in for lunch I noticed many items I wanted weren't there. The best things we had were the salmon teriyaki and Japanese fried udon, otherwise everything else was below average. 

Their rolls were awful! They put tempura flakes in everything as filler, they are small and not rolled tight enough. They don't have any descriptions under their rolls and they make it different than everywhere else. The waitresses kept walking around saying \"what you want\" cause you have to verbally tell them your order opposed to most AYCE where they have iPads or small forms. Their tempura was way too greasy, the sweet potatoe had oil dripping out of it. Sushi 168 is much better.

The only positive thing I can say about this place is everything I ordered came remarkably fast and they didn't forget anything which was good."}

{"text":"Wow I'm actually having a very difficult time believing that this restaurant got high reviews. I'm pretty sure the people that gave it high reviews are not experienced with Asian cuisine or sushi. It's practically made for people who don't know what real sushi is, low quality, poor taste and really slow service despite the small size of the restaurant. I'd never go here again. Best sushi places in the GTA are Tomo sushi on highway 16 and yonge (a la carte) and yang's kitchen (all you can eat) on warden and highway 7."}
{"text":"Weekend out - AYCE lunch as usual :)

The spicy salmon and tuna rolls are good, they added tempura crumbs inside made it tasted better.

The yam rolls - my fav - were not good tho. The yam was still raw and not much in the roll. I ordered twice trying to balance out the impressions but it didn't work out. One less start because of this.

Their dragon rolls were pretty good. Lots of ingredients inside.

Price was comparatively cheaper than other sushi buffets. Service was very good."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years but for the last 3 years I've given it a chance every 4-5 months or so. Each time Ive gone, the only two items I go to order are \"not available\" and they only let us know after we've started eating. It's deceiving, it's not cheap, and it's just not good business. Good luck. I'm surprised they've lasted this long :( I hope they improve for their own sake"}
{"text":"For an all-you-can-eat joint, the food is pretty good.  For some reason, prices are sky-high... try to avoid going to Hockey on a Friday night or weekend.  

As for many other all-you-can-eat places, I found that Hockey doesn't always bring out every roll/order you place with the waitress... At times, I've had to remind them about my orders, and it has the potential to be very annoying.

Overall, a good local spot for all-you-can-eat, but certainly doesn't compare to regular sushi restaurants in regards to quality and service."}
{"text":"Location: 1102 Centre Street Thornhill, ON L4J 3M8 (the plaza next to the No Frills)
Service: Terrible
Price: $$

I haven't gone to Hockey Sushi in forever and thought I would go to see if anything had changed. They renovated their layout and it looks a lot cleaner, more modern, and a bit more spacious. This visit reminded me why I have not gone to Hockey Sushi and why I would not go back.

A lot of the food was really salty (i.e. miso soup and teriyaki). The sushi itself had too much vinegar and made the rice tasted weird. What I am most disappointed about was their customer service. They rarely check up on us, and it was hard to call them over just to refill my water. It didn't seem like they care about their customers at all. I love sushi and I definitely had better experience at other places around the area. 

Verdict: There's better sushi places..."}
{"text":"1 star. & that 1 is for the sushi and the mushrooms with butter. 

But their service is something beyond ridiculous. Same quality sushi can be found many other places that provide better service. 
These people are completely rude, give you attitude in their speech AND look. Its like you are bothering them by being there.
If you hate ur job so much why are you here ? 

They sat us down at 3 for lunch menu ayce.. As we were starting to order they said we can order ONE time bcuz lunch menu is done in a couple of minutes.... What? If i come here for lunch, i can order until i am ready to go. Otherwise why are you sitting me down. 

They throw the food on the table, throw the reciepts .. Walk away before youre done your sentence.. 
Its BEYOND terrible service what in the f 

I apologize for bringing my money here to spend instead of the 800 other sushi options in toronto. 

This is what happens when they include gratuity on the bill.. They no longer make an effort 

Just unbelievable"}
{"text":"Hockey sushi is hit or miss every time you go. Some times the waiters and waitresses are good, and the other times they are completely horrible. For instance today we had the more older lady, we would wave her down and she would completely ignore us, but the younger waitress is amazing. Always cleans our table, is never rude whatsoever. They already add 10% to your bill as a service charge, so don't bother tipping! This sushi place is not the best, but it is pretty good still. Would not recommend as there are a lot of other great sushi places around, but I guess it's an okay option. It's 21.99 on weekdays and 23.99 on holidays and weekends. I would not go on the weekend tbh not really worth it."}
{"text":"For about a year, I made an effort to try as many AYCE sushi places as possible. Hockey Sushi does not realy stand out, but that's not a bad thing. What I've learned from trying many places is that most of them are essentially the same and that you'll generally get what you paid for. There's a few AYCE places that are cheaper but have a combination of less items and/or lower quality. 

Hockey Sushi is neither at the top or at the bottom. It's just about right, which is what I expect. What makes me like Hockey Sushi is that they have a 10% off coupon that you can print online. Plus it's pretty close to my house. Since most AYCE places are about the same, it's best if I just go to the closest one that has a discount! 

I like how they have squid sashimi for dinner. Many AYCE sushi places lack this. They also have the big fish eggs (Ikaura?) which is also not common. These 2 items, combined with 10% and being close to my house, makes Hockey Sushi the \"default\" AYCE sushi restaurant for me. Of course, they have standard things like Salmon, White Tuna, Mackerel, tempura etc...

The majority of AYCE sushi restaurants don't have servers that speak English as their native language. Hocky Sushi is no exception. But it has never been a problem for me. If anything, I'd find it awkward if they spoke perfect English. I don't understand why people people complain about the server's English level. The way I see it, if they speak perfect English, that's a sign that it's less authentic (like Spring Rolls, and other \"Westernized\" ethnic restaurants). Service is alright. They haven't screwed up my order yet."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to sushi spot. Used to because post break up, I gave this little joint up. You know, you split up, and one person gets the dog and the other gets the car... Well he got the sushi house. (I got the Thai place, only then that place closed down... Geebus! I really lost out, eh?!)

Anyway it had been a really long time since I had eaten here, so I was very surprised, pleasantly so, at the huge reno they had done. Honestly, it used to look like a dive.. Now it looks amazing.

The service has always been a hit and miss type thing, but for the most part they are decent about it. They also add a 10% service charge to their bills, regardless of what time you eat or how many people are in the group.

The food itself is pretty good. They have a huge selection. Although it is an AYCE sushi place, they also offer an a la carte menu. There are vegetarian options (in case anyone is vegetarian in your party) and a wide selection of noodle/soup, rice, dim sum, and teriyaki dishes (in case raw/fish is not someone's thing).

Anyway, it will probably be ages before I go here again (because it's a bit far for me) but this was the first place I enjoyed eating sushi and I think their new look has improved the atmosphere a lot, so I just wanted to share my view of the place!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty nice. Modern dark brown wood themed. Booths are spacey and comfortable. Sushi and maki were pretty good for an AYCE sushi place, I would not recommend anything breaded and deep fried here (AKA temporas). Prices were reasonable and comparable to any AYCE sushi restaurant, 10% tips added to your bill."}
{"text":"Trying to book my sons birthday asking for party room was like pulling teeth, they would not agree unless I guaranteed certain number of people. We were a party of 19. Eventually they agreed on the condition that I would have no less than 15 people. Service was horrible. Waiter kept complaining that he was the only one and could not handle a simple tasklike wiping spilled water off the floor, we had a few small children and I was very concerned of them falling on the wet floor. He was obviously having a bad day, but did not need to take it on us. Quality of food was decent for the price, but service spoiled our birthday. They ended up charging us for unfinished plate of sushi which I think was ridiculous but I paid them anyways. Overall disappointing day"}
{"text":"It's been our family restaurant for years and we've been very pleased overall. The atmosphere and clientele tends to be casual and suitable for families. The staff has always accommodated our strollers and need of high chairs.

The food is great and the AYCE menu is the reason we go there and find it enjoyable every time. The fish tastes fresh, the menu is varied and I have been overall very pleased with what arrived on our plates.

The staff could be friendlier and more reactive, but overall, I don't have too much to complain about. The bathroom is moderately clean and the room downstairs makes for nice dinner parties. 

Hockey Sushi is a place I've recommended to friends and one that has been our family's landmark"}
{"text":"Great place to go to if you enjoy eating human hairs along with your sushi rolls. I went here a couple times before their big renovations and I loved it. 

I noticed that seemingly after their renovations though, their service declined, and the management was appalling. 

So it so happened that me and two of my friends were eating and we found a hair in one of the rolls. This was near the end of our visit and we have had probably 6 or 7 other rolls before this. We had approximately two rolls left that already came but after finding that strand of hair we felt incredibly uncomfortable in continuing. 

We decided to take the bill and noticed that we were charged for the other rolls that we did not decide to finish. We asked to speak to the manager and he had the audacity to still charge us for the rolls and said \"Okay we will only charge you $1 more\" I must admit I felt rather sluggish that day and was not inclined to cause a scene.

As a result I decided to stay passive and pay the darn bill and go. Will not be returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard AYCE sushi joint. Nothing really special about it. 

The food: The menu has your standard selection of maki, sushi, sashimi, tempura and teriyaki. Everything tasted pretty fresh and one thing I did like about their maki rolls was that they did not use so much rice on the outside (therefore I didn`t fill up so quickly, YAY!). The sashimi tasted quite fresh but was cut way too thin for my liking. Everything else was pretty standard fare I have come to expect from this type of establishment. 

The service: non-existent. Servers come take your order, and bring you your food. The servers were quite grumpy but in this type of establishment I don`t expect 5 star service, a smile would still help. The food came out promptly (we were there on a Sunday at 4 pm so the place was virtually empty, not sure how fast the food comes out at peak times). They did not forget any of our order which was a bonus. 

The price: Weekend dinner was about 25 per person with tax and tip (they add a 10% service charge so be sure not to double tip for the bad service) 

Overall I would not go out of my way again to go to this place but if you are in the area it is not a bad option if you`re craving AYCE Sushi."}
{"text":"Here's a joke: How does hockey and sushi go together? They don't.

I'll keep my review short. The food is mediocre and selection is very limited. Yes, pieces were generously filled but the food lacks flavor and sushi rice was sub par. Overall, all food items were very bland.

I've changed my mind - this will be an in depth review. First complaint was they were late to open. My party arrived at opening, with reservation, and they didn't open until 11:15. Food service was consistently slow despite being the only table. 

The rice isn't made fresh. I'm certain they use old rice and reheat it the next morning. There's a lot you see when you arrive before all the staff. 

What I like: the ambience was nice. Spacious seating and clean utensils. 

Overall, the food was not bad. Just the experience sucked.

Will I revisit? Not until there's a change in management."}
{"text":"A decent All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi place.   Ok, here's my caveat with AYCE sushi places:  They serve pretty much the same thing.  A handful might serve more fried dishes, another handful might serve different rolls and another handful but have different menus for lunch and dinner.  There's not much that differentiates \"AMAZING\" ayce and mediocre.  I guess it all comes down to how fast the service is that night and  how fresh the sushi is.

With that being said, Hockey provides good value for it's price.  It's generally a cheaper AYCE - about $42 before tip on a weeknight.  It has all the main staples for me: Butterfish, Spicy Salmon handroll, Spicy Tuna handroll,  Chicken teriyaki (sue me) and good and tasty Spider Rolls.  Mang, I love the Spider Rolls.

I've been here regularly and never gotten sick, and general I've found the sushi to look and taste fresh.  

The place is small, so you might be rubbing elbows and overhearing people's conversations.

When would you go to Hockey?  A Wednesday night,  you don't want to cook after work and feel like stuffing yourself with Sushi."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for 5 years now !

-love the new renovations
-Staff are attentive
-fast service
-fresh sushi

Everytime I try a new sushi place, I compare it to hockey and no one can beat it :)

{"text":"How does naming a Sushi restaurant \"Thousand Island\" sound to you? At least that is the Chinese name of this place but I guess in this area, that specific business name wouldn't make sense now would it? If you name it after a Canadian fav pass-time, they will come? That might be the idea the owners had as they cater it to customers of this region. 

Which region is that? Do I have to draw you a map? Yelp doesn't allow me to draw here so.... 
                                                 South of Hwy 7
                                                
                        East of Hwy 400       Hockey      West of Bayview 
                                                
                                                North of Steeles 

Food comes out at good pace which is understandable and probably one of the business motto set here as the Food Sizes and Cooking Techniques needed to make most of these items are set to minimal. The Sushi items looked good and although the Shari(Sushi Rice) was a bit al dente, I can't fault them on that since it's an AYCE after all. 2.5 *Star* 

The Rolls looked a bit mangled on the plate presentation but again AYCE. I understand that Panko is nice to give a crunch to most soft textured Sushi but it was added as filler to most Rolls. Panko was basically a replacement for the Rice since it wasn't overly thick on Rice. I guess I'll take Panko over Rice balls anyday. 

Other items are Meh to A-OK while the services is typical Chinese as they are Chinese waiters and waitresses speaking Mandarin. The music was Mandarin POP too as I could barely hear it over the Non-asian crowd filling up 80% of this place to capacity. 

I'm just SAD that I wasn't able to test them to 100% capacity as I didn't order or eat the portion I would normally do as I had to rush back to work. I did them at 50% and at that pace they did a GOOD job providing all the items we requested. We had way too much fun chatting(i.e. Brazilian Wax to Nipples to Pimping) anyways to focus on the Food."}
{"text":"I'm crying as I write this most recent update.

The tears are streaming down my face, and my chest is soaked in these tears.

I'm sorry I cheated on you hockey. I was a whore. It wasn't your fault.
Please.
Love me.
Take me back.


But you didn't, you took your anger out on yourself.
Hockey self-mutilation.

First, you raised your prices. Okay, I can deal with that. It was just a dollar.

But then, you lowered the quality of the food.

We ordered the chicken wings. It was most definitely spoilt.

The rolls lacked the umph we always had.

So this is goodbye hockey.

I will always remember the times I've forcibly eaten way more than any man could ever eat.

I will always love you, but this is the end.

I'm sorry.

Please, don't take it out on yourself. I had ants in my pants, other fish to sample. I never meant to cheat on you, but I did."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night and I have to say I was not disappointed. Other then some frozen sashimi everything else tasted wonderful. 

Their menu had so many different things to choose from. The food tasted great and the service was amazing. Considering most all you can eat places don't need to have good service as the 10% service charge is already added on to the bill, this place gave great service and there were many of them so that there was always someone at your side.

Quite a small little establishment but they've got great comfy leather chairs, no booths which is a drag but the seats make up for it. Sometimes when it gets busy, the place gets a little too close for comfort as I could hear the conversation at the next table clearly. Also helped that one of the ladies was speaking loud.

Downstairs there's a huge party room in which you sit on the floor and have your legs dangling underneath the table. Cute idea but I can't remember the last time I went for all you can eat sushi with 30 other people. It is a little bit out of the way but definitely worth the extra few minutes of driving."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for Oscars night. It's super convenient that they deliver for free for orders over $25. Take out pricing was quite competitive so I was pleased to order more than usual. The sashimi was of decent quality (Tuna, salmon, Red snapper is not my favourite though) but unfortunately they don't offer unagi sashimi. Miso soup, wakame and yakotori were quite nice and I would order it again. 

This place is great as a sushi takeout staple and won't break the bank.

Update: 1 star off. Was going to eat here tonight and then saw a review from this month mentioning their recent  violation of York region health and food standards (failing to protect from food contamination). Going elsewhere now!"}
{"text":"For a T-Hill sushi spot with the ALL YOU CAN EAT option, Hockey Sushi is a great place to dine Asian style if you are just up north from Toronto.

My boyfriend took me for my first all you can eat experience at Hockey Sushi and I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied with their selection and fast service.

Here are some of the delightful rolls we ordered that I know I would recommend and my boy would:

- Salad Roll (Crab, lettuce and other veggies mixed in a mayo sauce)
- Spicy Salmon Roll (Fresh salmon, spicy sauce and tempura bits)
- Shrimp Tempura Roll (Crisp to perfection and juicy)
- Dynamite Roll (A yummy staple of shrimp, crab and veggies)


If you order rolls separately there, they range anywhere from $3.50 to $12.00, depending on what contents are in each roll.

If you go the ALL YOU CAN EAT route, it is around $17 per person.

So if you live uptown or in Thornhill and don't want to venture to the sushi spots of midtown and downtown Toronto, you have this lovely Asian stop near by your neighbourhoods."}
{"text":"Such bad customer service. Only good item here are the hand rolls (in my opinion)...yes it's ayce, and I don't find the quality of their food that good."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Newly renovated, couldnt believe the transformation! it was desperately needed. 

Food: Everything was on par, the chicken teriyaki maki, fresh salmon sushi, salmon teriyaki, dynamite rolls .. everything was fresh and hearty. For 13.99 for lunch you cant really go wrong. 

Overall: Definitely will be back, although its a little out of the way, its worth the trip."}
{"text":"I really don't understand how this place gets the reviews it does.  This quite possibly could be the worst Japanese restaurant I've ever been to.  Even food courts are better than this place.

The place is actually quite hard to find.  It's next to a country style, but the \"hockey\" part of the sign is in neon lights (which weren't turned on... helpful).  Apparently they also have another location out of town, but I'm guessing it's close to the same thing.

The service from this place was HORRENDOUS.  I mean, really really bad.  I remember asking someone for something else to add on and the two times I asked the same girl, she said \"just hold on\".  The place wasn't really packed, there were empty tables all around.  I also remember ordering steak teriyaki, and going back and forth telling the waitress how we wanted it cooked.  We asked for it rare (because it was really really well done before), and she replied \"medium?\".  This actually went on for about 3 iterations before we just kinda laughed and gave up.

The other thing about this place is that the quality of their fish.  Sashimi can't really be messed up... well that much.  There's only really a couple reasons why it can't be good.  The first, is the size of the cuts.  I mean, it's all you can eat, don't cut the fish into little pieces of paper.  The other thing is bones.  The sashimi had bones in it... gross.  You can tell what grade of fish they're actually using.

Save yourself a trip and never come here.  Even if there's a coupon (we had one), don't bother."}
{"text":"It's been 2 years since the last time I was here. The renovations are similar to the other Hockey sushis in the GTA. It looks amazing, the combination of dark tones with the right amount of lighting makes it look so much nicer than the bright, brown, wood grain walls and tables they had before. The addition of benches along one of the walls adds for extra seating as well the extension of the dining room at the front adds alot more seating than before. It felt great coming back to see all the changes but even better seeing familiar staff and most of them asking me where have I been?

The food hasn't changed one bit, still very consistent from before with fresh ingredients and new menu items. One thing I can not stress enough are their maki rolls, I LOVE the way they make them here. Nice thin layer of rice on the outside packed full of the good stuff on the inside, see one of my pictures to see what I mean.The other item that stands out is the spicy salmon sushi, the combination of the fresh salmon mixed with spice and the added crunch you get from the seeweed and tempura bits just makes you want more.

Now I will admit one flaw it is the service, I have seen other guest have trouble waving staff down to order items, it just feels like the staff do not see you even though you are directly looking at them. With that said though the food will more than make up for the okay service.

The past 2 years have gone by and I am glad to see business is still the same with a new and well deserved fresh look.

Items to definitely get
-Spicy Salmon Sushi
-Dragon Roll
-Shrimp Skewer
-Salmon Sashimi
-Beef with baby mushroom
-Salmon Belly Teriyaki"}
{"text":"We came here because of the good reviews.......

After ordering some of the sushi/maki pieces the first thing I noticed was that the chef's don't care about presentation at all. (If you know anything about how dragon roll should look order it and you'll see what I mean).
For me presentation is part of the sushi experience, but I figured my tastebuds would forgive given all of the positive reviews ....behhhhhhhhhhhnnnnnnnn WRONG! the quality is just not there. In fact, even the pieces are over sized - they barely fit in your mouth, and the fish on top of the sushi is minuscule, making the disproportion even more apparent.

Okay we thought....lets change the game plan....so my friend and I decided to switch to sashimi....thinking it would be the hardest thing to mess up.... wrong again..... we found bones in the red snapper.

at least the green tea ice cream is on par with every other sushi restaurant +1 star!

{"text":"I've been coming to this location for 4 years and it is still great.  Although a little small and busy on the weekends, the service is still great compared to most other sushi restaurants.  Service is quick and efficient, and rarely do they forget your order or skimp when you order a lot of one item.  My fiance and I love sushi and order 20-30 pieces of sushi/sashami at a time and we always get exactly what we order.  Compared to other restuarants, we find we need to always remind the server \"Umm... excuse me we orderd 10 shrimp tempura's or 20 pieces sashami\" when we have a large group.

Make sure to either book a reservation in the evenings on the weekend and print out a 10% coupon to as well from their website!"}
{"text":"Friendly server not alot of food options 
The pieces for sashimi
Is too small you have to keep ordering multiple times. They dont want to give you 20pc of salmon if you order it.
Too bad didn't take the pic the price you pay for the limited of selection."}
{"text":"I've seen other people saying the service was terrible, but it even worse when I want to try it. I walk in the sushi bar, no one welcome me or show me a table (there were several empty tables at that time). After 2 minutes, a young man point a table with the menu in his hand, after we sat he put the menu on the table and went away -- without saying even ONE word. I had to stand up and walk to other resturant."}
{"text":"This is my go-to ayce sushi restaurant when in the promenade mall area....maybe because they offer a 10% off coupon on their website! 

When you walk in, it appears as though it is a small cramped restaurant, but guess what!.....it is. Theres a whole floor below where the washrooms are located and also these typical Japanese \"sit-down on the floor\" boxes dedicated for large groups.

Food comes to your table super fast and super fresh. The dynamite and spicy salmon roll are some of my favourites. The servers are not super talkative or friendly....actually I don't remember the last time they even said a word while I was ordering. A few scribbles on their notepad, and sometimes a head nod is all you get before they walk away.

The place needs a reno, a fresh coat of paint and the outside of the restaurant could definitely use a new sign, but its got deliciously succulent sushi and sometimes thats all that matters."}
{"text":"This place is DISGUSTING. worst service ever.  I used to go there all the time and me and my girlfriend went there today they made us wait 20 minutes for a table, when they called us to sit down the server tells us before we sit you down if you find a hair in your food the bill is not free.  We were so confused why he is saying this to us. Then he is like last time you came you found a hair in your food and you got a free bill this time if there is a hair in your food you still have to pay. THIS IS THE MOST DISGUSTING RESTAURANT needs to get shut down, worst customer service. How do they have the odasity to tell you if you find a hair in your food before you even sit down you are not gettin it for free.. Never going back there again. EW"}
{"text":"Used to go here often, but the last time we were there one of the customers complained that there was a bug in her soup.  All that was offered was a replacement of the soup.  Sorry, but I can't do business with a restaurant that has no idea how to treat a customer. Too many other choices with great quality and service and respect for their customers."}
{"text":"Baby mushroom beef rolls are best tasting ever!!! All sushi really delicious. Green tea not too great and service slow. The food is worth it though - except maybe a little on the expensive side."}
{"text":"We came here yesterday for a birthday party with about 15 guests or so.  I have to say that I was really impressed with the fast service.  We were seated in the party room downstairs and those poor girls where haulin' a** up and down the stairs bringing us our oodles and oodles of sushi.

The sushi was super tasty (as usual) and I even enjoyed the spicy tuna rolls (I normally hate fish).  My only ish' with having such a huge party is that they bring all the sushi orders out on huge plates - and by the time the food would reach me whatever I had ordered for myself had been gobbled up by the people closer to the door.  Had to get a bit aggressive with my maki but it was well worth it.  Also - if you are a carnivore you should try the baby beef with mushrooms - people tend to looooove it.

Another good thing about the party room is that if you have small children in your party they can cause a ruckus and not bother the other customers.  They can just bother....us."}
{"text":"After 10+ years in is place has survived lots of competition and continued to evolve. With the recent upgrades in decode and new sign, the place looks more appealing to today's standards. 
I was recently invited for lunch with the expectations that it was not going to be that good. Fortunately I was pleasantly surprised. 
The food was prepared in light speed and had the state I was looking for. 
Unfortunately some of the staff were not very pleasant and the fish to rice was unbalanced. There was more rice than fish. 
Overall a nice choice and great price."}
{"text":"My friends and I got back from school and decided to reunite here, at Hockey Sushi. I had to ask them to clear the table 3 times because it was a complete mess ( I've complained after the second time and still they didn't take away our food )

{"text":"I was trying to look for an AYCE sushi in York Region that didn't cost an arm and a leg on a weekend.. looked at all the other popular places around and they were all $28+..then I remembered Hockey Sushi and was relieved to see that the weekend price is $23.99 per person with an extra 10% coupon until December 31, 2015 (must be printed off the website).

The fish at Hockey is decent, not the best but can't complain and they have really good tamago (sweet egg)! The menu offers a large variety of sashimi, sushi, rolls, cooked foods, tempura and ice cream for dessert.. obviously not comparable to the new fancy places where you order with iPads, have seared/pressed sushi etc.. but just a classic AYCE sushi restaurant.

The restaurant has been renovated since the last time I've been here..probably ~5 years ago.. they have comfortable seating with many booths. The service at Hockey was surprisingly better than any other AYCE restaurant I've been to. We got there around 6:30 and was seated with no wait; we might have beat the dinner rush. There was a handful of people waiting for a table at times throughout the night. The servers were quick to collect empty plates, refill water/tea and (most) food came quickly after being ordered."}
{"text":"4 stars for food
2 stars for service

If you've read a few other reviews of this place, they don't lie. Tasty eats and crappy service. 

I visited Hockey Sushi with two friends last night. We ordered a few maki rolls, sushi, sashimi and kitchen items. Everything came out extremely fast, almost superhuman fast. The flavours were nice, but if service is your thing, don't come here as you hardly get any! When you eventually get a servers attention, whatever you want comes quickly to the table - it's just the initial attention grabbing. Two things that really threw me off though was that the menu doesn't thoroughly describe what rolls are. For example, a B.C Roll. at Golden Maki restaurant is BBQ eel, avocado, and cucumber. At Hockey Sushi, it's salmon, avocado and fish eggs. The other thing is that you don't write your order down; you relay it verbally to your server. This makes me feel like a glutton as I order my copious amounts of food.

I also think it's extremely weird to have a fish tank with live fish in a sushi restaurant... anyone else?

Regardless of all the above, I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because a lot of ^ is my personal preference. The food was decent and I'm finding a solid AYCE resty in this area is rare."}
{"text":"Very solid sushi. Problem with this place is the same I experience at any Asian restaurant as a white person... Crap customer service. I must say, I always get the food almost instantly and the fish is very fresh here. In the Thornhill area, definitely your best bet."}
{"text":"I don't care what people say...this is still my favourite AYCE place in my area. It's been around for 10+years and it's even better than when it first opened. They redid the inside which is super nice.... And the waiters give or take  are nice!! They have my fav BC roll and flying fish egg salad. It gets busy on the weeknights and weekend lunches so come early!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go here often while I was in High School. 
The food is pretty good for an all you can eat sushi place and for the right price too. My problem with the place is that I have gotten sick there one too many times and I now refuse to go there period because of how badly I got sick the last time.

Service is mediocre at best but that is because the place is usually full and the waitresses have a lot to put up with.

I've tried the majority of the menu and it tastes fine but you are taking a big risk when you eat there. Be careful"}
{"text":"My jaw dropped when I saw the green dragon role which was SOOO BiG!!!!!!!!! Lots of ingredients inside and it tastes like heaven. I want to go back right now!!!"}
{"text":"I really like Hockey Sushi, the prices are very cheap and the food is excellent.

I went once before for the AYCE and everything was good and came out quickly as this is not a huge restaurant.

Last night i got takeout and everything was also good.

I highly recommend the shrimp tempura roll and beef tempura roll. Also got the avocado roll.

They have an enoki beef app thats amazing and the meat is sooo tender.

Also got the beef fried rice which is worth trying!

And all for $34."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times recently I can certainly say my visits here have been enjoyable for the most part. I come here for the AYCE lunch buffet for $12.99 (using the 10% off coupon - yay)! We arrived at the restaurant at 1pm on tuesday. I think the price is quite good for the quality of food. My table didn't need to wait long and all of our orders came! However, I've noticed that only one or two of the service waiters are actually friendly and likely to ask if I wanted my water filled or have another order with them. 

My favourite maki rolls are dragon, dynamite and rainbow rolls! Very tasty. I also like the tempura, but I find that it has a bit too much batter for me. The only thing that seemed to taste bad was the scallop. It had a funky smell...it probably wasn't very fresh. But I didn't get sick from it. And we ended our lunch with dessert... sort of limited to just a couple of ice cream flavours (green tea, red bean, mango). They always bring our bill when our dessert is served. Overall, I always leave this restaurant feeling super full and satisfied. 

For those that experience diarrhea, perhaps its because of the over consumption of \"white tuna\" sushi which is actually made of Escolar fish. I've only recently heard about the temp health effects of eating that particular fish, and it's not banned in Canada, so beware. It's also so delicious that it makes it so hard for me to not eat it."}
{"text":"Hockey sushi has long held a spot in my AYCE heart. There's nothing particularly great about their food, and the service is atrocious, but there's something that keeps me coming back when the time calls for AYCE. The fish is pretty good, and for what you're paying they deliver. One of my favourite AYCE sushi places."}
{"text":"Decent quality sushi for the price. Known for it's cheap \"all you can eat\" special, don't expect white glove service in return. For sushi at this price, be thankful you don't get worms!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's bday dinner and I'm hoping this would be my final review on this place, being it my third, you can tell I have a love and hate relationship with Hockey. 

Dinner was served fast and efficient by many new faces, a mix of agitated and welcoming staff had the orders mixed up a couple of times but resolved quickly.

Salmon sashimi was still not that fresh but the green dragon rolls had quality packed into them once again! Cheese mussels were huge and tasty, freshly baked with no funny taste as most places have.

All in all, still a great place for locals to celebrate and enjoy the selections of fast and delicious numbers."}
{"text":"Theyre pretty good here.  Nothing to specifically write home about but just a great 
overall place to get your fix.  Service is nothing special but only a few sushi places have 
amazing service.  I'd say probably the best place in Thornhill."}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place has been in Thornhill for so long yet I had never tried it. Two weeks ago I ate lunch at this place for the first time with a good friend of mine. I suggested sushi and he suggested Hockey Sushi. Having never been I decided to give it a shot as I had heard the name thrown around in the past. The menu features everything you could want for all-you-can-eat sushi. Salads, appetizers, nigiri, maki rolls, donburi, fried rice, udon, soups...the list goes on. Sashimi, like most AYCE places is available at dinner only. What really surprised me the most about Hockey was the freshness of the fish. My past experiences with all you can eat sushi bars have been hit/miss in terms of the fish's taste. Every piece at Hockey was soft and did not taste old/fishy unlike some other restaurants I have tried. Even though the dining room was full, the service was excellent good and our orders came to the table quickly and precisely (another big problem at other restaurants are forgotten/wrong orders). Overall, my experience at Hockey Sushi was excellent and I cannot wait to try more of their items next time."}
{"text":"I generally didn't used to like the place because if the service and the OK food. This time I went there as it was pretty late and they are the only all you can eat sushi that has lunch till 3:30pm and not 3:00pm. Was very surprised by the super quick service and extremely fresh and tasty Salomon. Will start going back there after over 3 years of absence."}
{"text":"This is my first experience in a sushi place where I've had to argue with a waitress about whether or not my food is tasty. 

We ordered a few rolls, spicy salmon, spicy tuna etc. 
the filling was 90% deep fried tempura flakes and mayo, 10% fish. It was greasy and hard to eat. 

When we didn't eat it, the servers were upset and gave us a warning that they were going to charge us. \"There's fish right there!\" she said, pointing to one of my rolls. 

Anyway, the service was terrible and the food was even worse. 

Will not be going back."}
{"text":"All You Can Eat and Japanese restaurant is pretty much an oxymoron. It is VERY hard to find a good AYCE Japanese restaurant where the ratio of quality to price is fair. Hockey Sushi is no exception from this rule. Their service is fast and fairly attentive. The restaurant was 85% full when I was there, which is typically an indicator of good food....alas, it was not the case. The sashimi did not taste fresh and the buffet menu lacked some items, which are more expensive, but can be found on the menu of better AYCE restaurants. Their rolls are nothing to write home about. I would not buy their rolls a la cart if I had the choice.

And choice is what it boils down to, since Hockey Sushi probably bets that it's the only AYCE restaurant in the neighbourhood and you wouldn't bother looking for a better venue. If, however, the owner and the chef care about the quality of their food, I think need to up their game. I would suggest they visit Ichiban on 16th / Leslie in Richmond Hill or Japango near Bay St / Dundas St in Toronto, 'cause these places are very good at what they do.

Overall, I won't be back at Hockey Sushi. If I want AYCE next time I'm in Richmond Hill / Markham, I'd rather go to Yamamoto near Pacific Mall, which provides much better value for the money."}
{"text":"This is my second review of Hockey sushi. Came here for lunch and they gladly accepted our 10% coupon, which my friend had printed in advance for our table. The food is like most standard AYCE sushi. The service was fast and great. They have got much better since my last visit a few years back and I loved their classic background music :D
My fav order was the BC roll and their little Salmon sushi pizza"}
{"text":"Hockey has been my go-to AYCE sushi spot for sometime now. My sushi aficionado friends find the quality to be horrendous. I, on the other hand, keep coming back due to a serious lack of alternatives in the vicinity and the phenomenal value ($12.99 for lunch). Although, recently, I have noticed a big decline in quality. I mostly go for their vegetarian rolls because I find their tuna and shrimp to be pretty tasteless. The servers are very efficient but as a lot of people have noted, they are not the most polite."}
{"text":"I went with the elite of yelp, so it had to be good! And it was, at least for a my taste (which is not the most accurate) :P

Good price for all that we had, a big variety of choices, and a really nice green tea + red beans ice cream at the end.

Tks for the good time guys!"}
{"text":"Until this past weekend, I hadn't been to Hockey Sushi in years.  I stopped going because the service wasn't great and the sushi started going down hill.  But, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised this time.  The spicy salmon sushi was delicious and so was the rest of the meal. The service was as you would expect at one of those all-you-can-eat places.  I will definitely go back again - and not wait a few years this time."}
{"text":"I would give it a 3.5 star if I could. It is not great but most dishes are tasty and there is a wide selection to choose from. Service is ok and my favorite is the baby beef mushroom roll, I typically eat a couple of dozen of those little guys."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday. I'm going to have to say that their sushi wasn't the freshest and the rolls were mediocre. Overall I would say the food is average and deserves a 3-star rating.

What brought them down is their service. They always seem to be in a rush to deliver food or take your order, making it feel like they're trying to rush you out. On top of that, the sushi came really quickly, which is nice, but you could tell the rolls and sushi were sloppily made. 

This is the kind of place that you go to if you're hungry and just want quick cheap food. If you want to take your time to enjoy good food and hang out with friends, I definitely would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Hockey Sushi? Why is it call Hockey Sushi? I should have ask one of the wait staffs here.. but I know I would never get an answer out of them. Since I never even ever talk to me... no eye contact... hey here here here! 

I think Hockey Sushi is one of the worse AYCE for services. These Mandarin speaking waitstaffs are the coldest bunch of people I ever meet. Maybe you think we are just some cheapo coming for AYCE sushi and you have your 10% tips regardless how you treat us... but we still customers.....

Aside from the services.. the food is Meh. The rolls are mainly made with rice rolling loosely together with hardly any ingredients inside. How can tempura bits be in almost all the rolls?? I know cost cutting to maximize profit. The spicy tuna and salmon tasted the same rice/tempura bits/seaweeds and mayo... where is the fish??

The sushi we order has this thin piece of fish on it.. I have to give credit for the kitchen staffs to able to slice fishes that thin... a technique to be trained by frequent practising. The quality of the fish is standard for AYCE. 

Presentation... I don't need any great presentation.. but at least don't let loose food dangling out of the plate and on the table.. gee am I suppose to eat those??

Now to the cooked food. Hockey Sushi really have to take it easy on the deep fryer.  I am really puzzled when Chicken Teriyaki is served as a deep fried chicken cutlet with some teriyaki sauce on top. Here come the chicken with curry served with the same chicken cutlet with curry sauce on top?? First time I have Chicken Teriyaki in a form of fried chicken.....am I eating at KFC??

Green Tea Ice cream is good though... no complaint with the ice cream.

Lucky I am with some fun loving, asskicking yelpers! They make my lunch experience here so enjoyable! + 2 stars!!"}
{"text":"I would say that the food at this AYCE is average. It's not bad or particularly good. Similar to all the other AYCE. I went there for lunch but I thought the menu selection is less than other restaurants. The price is competitive tho."}
{"text":"The all you can eat menu is not terrible, I don't expect amazing food when I'm getting bulk in small portions. This, I would say justifies their diarrhea-inducing regular menu, but I wouldn't go here again  even if it IS your birthday, Shannon."}
