{"text":"I give this place five stars based simply on pricing and hospitality/friendliness. The VFW hosted a tournament for my darts league last weekend, and they were by far the best hosts we've ever had for one of these events. The small-staffed kitchen made sure to get an early start and get everybody fed (these tend to be pretty boozy events), and they served up one of the best $3.50 cheeseburgers I've ever had. Domestic taps at $2 and a small but nice selection of micros and import taps for $2.75. You simply can't beat that anywhere in the Madison area. The bar patrons were very cordial, with several going out of their way to ask if us newcomers were having a good time. Bartenders were extremely friendly as well. Now that I know this place is open to the public, I'll certainly be coming back. I hope we can get more tournaments here in the future. Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for the Friday night fish fry!  It can get crowded but when that happens, you can just wait in the lively bar area with the regulars. Pints are pretty cheap (under $3) and you caneven order bar food there if you can't wait for your table to be ready in the dining hall.  Also in the bar area you'll find lots of military patches on display along the walls which is interesting to look at. I took my parents here when they visited and my Dad noticed some patches from when he was in the army, stationed in Germany in the late 1950s/early 1960s.   Another perk at the VFW is there's usually a live band on Friday's starting at 8pm (no cover). Lots of dancing ensues.  Good times!  Fish Fry is served 5-8pm I believe.  I think everything on the menu is reasonable priced and yummy.  Your entree comes with bread, choice of coleslaw or cottage cheese, and choice of french fries or baked potato. Dessert is extra and they often run out.  Beware, cash only.  Service has always been friendly too.  I think all of the servers are part of the ladies auxiliary. ."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am a member of the ladies auxiliary here at post 7591. That being said, the fish fry is delicious. Every third Sunday of the month, between October and June is an omelet breakfast and it's great too.  Update: The Fish Fry is every Friday from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. The breakfast is 9 a.m. to noon."}
{"text":"The fried cod was fair and the potato was okay. The fries left something to be desired. Overall price was nominal, but a bit high relative to the quality.  CAUTION: this place only takes cash; however, there is an ATM on premises. I am sure I will find places that offer better quality fare and accept plastic."}
{"text":"These are wonderful people!  This is an outstanding organization!  They are a five star for the service and dedication they have displayed throughout life.   The bar area is large, plenty of room for socializing and such.  The fish fry was just not my cup of tea. The price is right mostly but the portions are small. The fish needs to be more crispy for my taste. The hash browns are okay. The French fries not so okay  I would never say do not support your local VFW. They deserve our support for their service. Just understand the fish fry could be better"}
{"text":"Was new to the area for lunch and was surprised they didn't really serve lunch. plenty of alcohol if you would like that.  been to other VfWS and got lunch. also they only take cash nothing else that also was a surprise in the world of debit cards being a major item used by most people.  bartender was nice and friendly. my review is just to let others know not a place really to eat  if you want even a Bar burger."}
{"text":"A friend and I just had the Friday Night fish fry. It was delicious. The place was busy, full of folks having fish. Nothing fancy decor-wise, but so what? FISH FRY! It was 13 bucks for a BIG piece of walleye, hashbrowns, slaw, bread and butter. The fish: perfect. The slaw: super good and not too mayonnaise-y. The service (we ate at a table, not the bar): such nice ladies! They have Spotted Cow and Fat Squirrel on tap! The VFW is open to the public. Try the fish fry. The next thing I need to try is their Champagne- Omelette Breakfast. It's served every 3rd Sunday of the month from October through June- not sure what time it begins and ends, but I will find out... OK,  I called them: \"9am till aaah, I dunno, noon?\" is what they told me. :)"}
{"text":"Cheap (like, really cheap) drinks, great Friday fish fry, and a ton of old guys who will talk to you about really random things or tell you how dumb your tattoos are. The bar special on Fridays is something like 5 or 6 dollars for what seems like 8 pounds of french fries and cod chunks.   Fish fry overview: Flaky, tender, cod, with a light batter. Crispy wavy cut fries. Delicious tartar sauce. Average coleslaw. Tasty roll.   Bonus: You get a molasses cookie with your meal!  Bonus 2: They have amazing pie!  On top of the cheap drinks (tYMMV, but my old fashioned was delicious) and tasty fish you also get very attentive wait staff that are all super friendly.   I am so glad i live a few blocks from here because I don't know if I would have ever experienced it otherwise. Good stuff!"}
